3533740,5,B001DJLD1C,I ordered these close to Elvis Week and received them very fast. I would purchase from here agian.,1283126400,,98,4.5
3533741,3,B001DJLD1C,"A fun collection with excellent audio-video. This is a blast for those baby-boomers who saw these Presleys in the movies in the 1960s, then watched facsimilies on TV (bad reception, tinny sound) in the 1970s; then passable dubs on VHS in the 1980s. You know the storylines and the songtitles.

Best: LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Must be surmised that the powers-that-be finally decided to make a contemporary vehicle for the star: although production values approximate a Made-For-TV in 1968, we have an adult movie with adult themes, and just three songs in the course of the story. The only fantasy part is a production number of a dream scenario. Although Elvis could have cut loose a bit more, he looks fantastic, hair in a '50s pompador, trimmed way down. No ""Do The Clam"" here! His acting at times is surprisingly strong - he must have appreciated the change, the maturation of his screen character. His comic timing and body English surely evaded those lazy critics at the time. I doubt Brando or Cary Grant fans would find any issue with what Elvis accomplished here.
An interesting aspect is in the location shots, I surmise, in and around Beverly Hills. Gives one a chance to imagine what an Elvis TV series might have looked like! We see Elvis driving down a real street, running on a real beach. It's different!

Worst: GIRL HAPPY. As a Beach Movie, it's one of the best, but for a star seriously near age 30, and for his co-star, an excellent actress, Shelley Fabares, also past the age to play a 20 year old, it's pretty embarrassing. A plus, however, are some production numbers with real '50s Rock and Roll - when the camera decides to focus on Elvis for more than two seconds, it's pandemonium. But Gary Crosby faking bass and the other band guys mugging it up are too much.

Funniest: TICKLE ME features Elvis in great form, doing physical comedy as well as anyone, then or now. A curious mix of slapstick and adult situations but the thing hangs together. Although it's been said he had to be dragged onto the set, something kicked in, and we have a pretty solid comedy.
(For those who analyze in depth, that risque line Lonnie says to Mrs. Radford in the jeep is cut).

Grooviest: KISSIN' COUSINS, another non-favorite amongst the literary elites, has a great soundtrack and a funky, off-kilter feel about it; a decent script, though things go a little haywire in the last 10 minute or so; strong performances by Jack Albertson, as Elvis' Military superior, also Cynthia Pepper as the Typist sent from the Pentagon to keep records - turns out she becomes the only one to keep a semblance of order, as the mission to secure a military site on a Mountain inhabited by reluctant mountaineers constantly veers off course; only about *one* too many songs.
Though it's apparent Elvis is not as engaged as he could be, it's not surprising, as this was the first official ""quickie"" in his career - and involved Elvis playing his own cousin and wearing a blonde wig. Producer Sam Katzman, known as ""The King of the 'Quickies'"", did his thing: this film was reportedly completed in 18 days.
For those who study the music, ""Smokey Mountain Boy"" is on the soundtrcak - was not on a VHS edition; and, disappointingly enough, a great meium soul rocker, ""Catchin' On Fast"", shows up in the *record album* version! (The movie version is heard in the ""Extras"", featuring original movie trailors).",1281139200,,3400,4.699664429530201

3533744,2,B001DJLD1C,"Hey, I'm an Elvis fan, but overall this is NOT a great collection, and some films on it are quite embarrassing. Three of the four are from the mid-60s, which was the low point of his film career since by then MOST of the ""travelogue"" types of films that Elvis was still making had declined in quality with poor scripts, weak songs, and low production values. I do think that ""Girl Happy"" is a fun film and is the best in this set, with Shelley Fabares adding sparkle to it, but it includes just a couple of good songs. The one here from the late-60s, ""Live a Little, Love a Little,"" has some decent scenes and songs (such as ""Almost in Love,"" ""A Little Less Conversation,"" and ""The Edge of Reality""), and for his films was unusually frank in dealing with sexual matters, yet the film is undermined by a poor script. So unless you're either an Elvis completest or you already know you like these films, stick to his best: ""King Creole,"" ""Wild in the Country,"" ""Follow That Dream,"" ""Jailhouse Rock,"" ""Loving You,"" ""Flaming Star,"" ""Speedway,"" and ""Viva Las Vegas.""

3533746,3,B001DJLD1C,"This 4 pack of Elvis treats was an Elvis fan delight. It starts with Kissing Cousins with double the Elvis. Elvis is surrounded by a passel of beauties. He gets to sing to his hearts delight and still gets into a fight with himself. With the movie ""Live a little,Love a little"" you have one of the most adult Elvis movies. It streches the boundries of reality with vivid weird dreams and boundless sexual humour. It's nice to see Dick Sargent and Rudy Vallee in this movie, but Don Porter seems miscast. Elvis's dad makes a quick non-speaking cameo. Blink and you may miss him. Overall a good Elvis movie. (his dog is neat too).In ""Girl Happy"" we have the classic Elvis as a singer. He then falls for Shelly Fabares. Shelly is wonderful in this role! We also have the sultry Mary Ann Mobley who steals the spotlight with her gorgous acting. This is a fun filled singing Elvis farce that will delight almost all Elvis fans. Int h final film, ""Tickle Me"" we have fun filled Elvis romp in the desert fat farm. Elvis gets to sing and help young female clients lose weight. Of course he drawn to one of the co-workers. The very co-worker who doesn't want anything to do with him. He wins her over with music and charm. Watch for Elvis magic guitar that seems to start to play drums and trumpets and all sorts of music, even when Elvis puts it down to sing even better. Other than that, this is a fun filled boy meets girl Elvis fim. Four fun filled ""Elvis"" movies packed together to make any Elvis fan happy.",1238716800,31,1503,4.39068100358423

3533795,5,B001DJLD1C,"This is an excellent set, held back a bit by Kissin' Cousins (a poor man's Li'l Abner). Girl Happy is probably the quintessential beach movie of the 60's. Elvis and Shelley have great chemistry, and there is a good supporting cast (Mary Ann Mobley, Chris Noel, and the band). Also has a decent soundtrack with songs appropriate to the movie (best are Puppet on a String, Spring Fever, Meanest Girl in Town, the title track, and the amazing? Wolf Call). Tickle Me is a fun kids movie with an excellent soundtrack consisting of previously-released songs (love It Feels So Right, Such An Easy Question, and Dirty, Dirty Feeling). Elvis sparkles in the comedy bits, and no guy will ever forget Jocelyn Lane! Nice to also see Julie Adams after her escape from The Creature From The Black Lagoon.  LALLAL is probably the most underrated Elvis movie. It has a more mature theme and some really cool bits, with two especially strong songs -- Edge of Reality and A Little Less Conversation. Kissin' Cousins has Yvonne Craig before she was Bat Girl and a good group of veteran supporting actors, but the movie only took a few weeks to make and it shows.

""Kissin' Cousins"" is still as entertaining as when it came out. 1964 was the year and I am quite sure it would have been in the top 10 list for sheer entertainment value. It features two versions of Elvis, one a blond! I love this movie. The other two movies have their moments and are worth watching again but are much more like the ""Elvis Movies' "" that have been stereotyped in popular culture, i.e. for mass consumption, thin plots,average acting and usually but not always a reason (Ft. Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce) to have been made to begin with. This is not always the case of course. ""Blue Hawaii"" which is not here, was the one really great Chamber of Commerce movie Elvis did. That is because of the songs that became huge hits.

3534029,5,B001DJLD1C,Ok bought this for a gift and it hasn't been given yet. All I can say is it was packaged very well and I received it when I was told I would. It is new and in sealed package.,1355529600,,174,3.4871794871794872
3534030,4,B001DJLD1C,It was a gift for my granson's 16th birthday. He's a Special Needs young man and a very rabid Elvis fan!,1355011200,,104,4.0
3534031,3,B001DJLD1C,"Pretty standard Elvis fare. Kissin Cousins is a bit of fun, especially with Elvis in the double role. Girl Happy is standard 60's and seems to meld into a number of his others (maybe because Shelley Fabares and Mary Ann Mobley were in more than one Elvis movie, sometimes in the same year!). I liked Tickle Me, it had more real humour than most Elvis films, except Follow that Dream. And I could live without Live a Little except for the song Edge of Reality. Overall, movies I remember from the 60's Drive In with Mum, Dad and Sis packed in the car on a friday night. Some good memories, some good songs, some embarrasing acting and pretty harmless fun. That said, I liked Elvis early movies much more, the songs were better and he wasn't sleep walking thru' the, admittedly unchallenging, roles.",1348963200,,797,4.580419580419581
3534032,5,B001DJLD1C,"My Mom Crazy for Elvis!!! I bought my mom 9 DVDs, all of Elvis. They were movies like ""Love Me Tender"", ""Flaming Star"" and ""Wild in the Country"" with a live on tour DVD. She see these DVDs all night and Day, 24/7 it seems. I go for a visit and she watching one of his movies. I'm getting a bit tired of it but she is just crazy over heel for him even after nearly 40 years after he died. Thank You Amazon for having all of his movies and the other DVDs on him to complete my mother's collections!!!!",1346889600,,499,3.9504950495049505
3534033,4,B001DJLD1C,"When I first saw this set, I said how can you go wrong with 4 Elvis movies for $12? Here's my take: Two are good, Two are not so good. Clearly the winners here are ""Girl Happy"" and ""Tickle Me"". Sure these movies are silly, but it is all part of the simple, carefree times in the mid 1960's. I remember them well. ""Girl Happy"" is a solid Elvis Movie with Shelley Fabares in the leading role. You can't go wrong with this one. She is in my top 5 of Elvis's leading ladies. ""Tickle Me"" is also fun entertainment with lesser known Jocelyn Lane as Elvis's love interest. She is also in my top 5 picks for leading lady. It is so much fun to see her in no less than 6 different outfits. You won't be able to take your eyes off her. She is flat out hot! ""Live a Little, Love a Little"" is the worst Elvis movie I have ever seen. It was so bad, I could't watch any more after the first 1/2 hour. ""Kissin' Cousins"" rates a little better but not nearly as enjoyable as the first two. Overall, you can't go wrong for the money. Snuggle up on the couch with some Orville Reddenbacher and enjoy The King and his harum.",1336521600,12,1103,4.064220183486238
3534034,5,B001DJLD1C,Great set of some of his best movies. Now trying to get rest to complete collection. Just wish his concerts came on disks like this. I mean 2/3 concerts to a single disk.,1333238400,,170,4.181818181818182
3534035,4,B001DJLD1C,"I bought this DVD for two reasons. First, it had the movie ""Girl Happy"" that includes Shelley Fabares who I liked in the old TV sitcom ""Donna Reed"". Second, Elvis movies include a lot of period scenery that I enjoy. For the second reason, I especially liked ""Viva Las Vegas"" (Vegas from the 60's) and ""Blue Hawaii"" (the Coco Palms on Kauai, Hawaii, destroyed by Hurricane Iniki).

As other reviewers have said before, the plot of Elvis movies is pretty thin, but I still find it good entertainment. Plus, 4 movies for the price of one.... not too bad, and a lot of the music is pretty good too.",1328572800,,594,4.4495412844036695
