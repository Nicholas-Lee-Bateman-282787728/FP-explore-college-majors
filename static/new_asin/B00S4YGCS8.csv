8718520,4,B00S4YGCS8,"Sequel in name only, this WW2 shocker boasts slick production design, visuals and a sharp cast. The actors improve the story about ambushed American soldiers with plenty of gritty ensemble work that creates suspenseful, realistic moments. Andrew Harwood Mills is the sharp-shooter who displays both disbelief and strength while facing terrible odds. Aaron Stielstra's bitter sergeant displays the uncanny presence of a young Robert Ryan from a Samuel Fuller Korean war movie.

There's plentiful gore and great prosthetic work. My complaints lie in the script's departure into some confusing fantasy elements near the end, and there's unwelcome CG effects that do pop up in places. This dilutes some of the earlier carnage onscreen.

Dan van Husen, famous for his past work with Tinto Brass, Herzog, Fellini, and appearances in numerous spaghetti westerns, is perfect as the movie's chilling nazi scientist. This is definitely worth checking out for fans of war-horror and those sick of low budget movies which celebrate their unprofessional efforts--while still getting distribution.",1435968000,,1083,5.557575757575758
