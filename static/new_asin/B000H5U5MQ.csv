2627174,4,B000H5U5MQ,"This enjoyable low-key British crime drama continues with Peter Davison as the under-appreciated, constantly bullied, but well-loved copper, DC Davies. Following his eviction by his landlady, he is now forced to live with his idiosyncratic friend Mod (Sean Hughes). His estranged wife, Julie (Emma Amos), doesn't appear until the 2nd episode and this season we get to see a less pleasant side of her. The second season doesn't have quite as much interaction between Davies and his friends and colleagues as I would have like. This was its appeal to me in the first season. Here it focuses more on the crime solving and mystery element. The mysteries however don't have quite the polish of those from Arthur Conan Doyle, P.D. James or Agatha Christie. Still they serve as moderately intriguing puzzlers. Again, just 4 episodes in this season. British seasons are so painfully short. Thankfully the episodes last a good 70-minutes each.

Episode 1 (Christine) finds Davies looking into the mysterious demise of a rich painter, apparently burnt to death in his own locked room. Suspicion falls on the young, alluringly beautiful and not too grieving widow, Christine (the very sexy Susan Vidler). Mod comes up with his usual crackpot theory: spontaneous human combustion.

Episode 2 (The Long Bank Holiday) finds Davies bullied into working over the Easter weekend. He helps an Indian pharmacist settle a dispute with a racist neighbour and then discovers a horde of buried bones in the man's backyard. An apparent suicide on the train tracks and the disappearance of a prisoner on home-leave are tied together by a murder that happened 20 years ago.

Episode 3 (Benefit to Mankind) has Davies travelling to Wales to look into the apparent suicide of a scientist involved in pharmaceutical research and the subsequent disappearance of his assistant. His sympathetic boss tries to help by counselling him to be more assertive and Davies finally shows some temper and backbone by standing up to the young detectives who constantly poke fun at him.

Episode 4 (Dangerous & The Lonely Hearts) is based on the last of Leslie Thomas' ""Dangerous"" novels. It is also the most satisfying of the four episodes. Davies helps 8-year-old Katie track down her mother's killer. Davies discovers that his boss visits the same dating agency as the dead mother and that they had gone out together. He also reaches the end of the tether with his estranged wife and gives her an ultimatum.

Not quite as sunny and jovial as the first season, this still makes for a very pleasant evening of light, easy-going entertainment. Like the previous season, Acorn presents this in the original 1.78:1 widescreen (Anamorphic). The 4 episodes are generously spread over 2 discs. Picture quality is excellent. Sound is in the original 2.0 Dolby Surround. Again, no subtitles are provided. Extras include a biography and bibliography for Leslie Thomas, a cast filmography and a picture gallery.

Note: The Fourth season has already aired in Britain and the Fifth is currently in production.",1165017600,22,3054,5.0858283433133735
2627175,5,B000H5U5MQ,"I bought season 1 unseen, and watched every episode twice within two weeks.  I thought one episode was weak but the others were great.  I liked every episode of season two very much--no weak episodes here.  Dangerous Davies is supposedly the last detective his boss would send out on a case, but in season two he gets more responsibility and at times seems to be the intended chief investigator on real murder cases.  Still, most episodes begin with him being put in an embarassing situation to keep his image as the butt of department jokes.  There are no cheap shocks in the series, rather it is an enjoyable show featuring a decent and dogged detective.  Almost all the criminals and suspects like him because he's unprepossessing, direct, and sympathetic or at least understanding.  Peter Davison was a bit bland as Campion, but he's excellent here, very decent and put upon, but not weak or feckless, in fact he shows some impishness and unexpected forcefulness at times this season.  His body language and facial expressions clearly convey what he is thinking and feeling as his cases progress.  Likewise, while Campion's almost-two hour shows dragged at times, the one-hour format makes for great pacing here.  Davies's friend Mod is also a treat--a combination of self-impressed intellectual, gullible self-improver, and deluded expert on all things who is charming in his goofy way. I'm looking forward to season three and the apparently in-progress season four in the future.  One of my favorite TV series, without a doubt.",1162857600,14,1533,5.019762845849803
2627196,5,B000H5U5MQ,"I've now watched all 4 seasons and enjoyed every episode.  The sidekick, Mod, should have been kicked to the curb way back early in the series or at least made less obnoxious instead of more irritating.  Peter Davison does a fine job as Dangerous Davies.  The series is a great change of pace from the usual loud and emotionally-exhausting mystery/crime/detective series.",1484784000,,371,5.049180327868853

2627198,5,B000H5U5MQ,"The Last Detective tv series constinues to be entertaining and engaging. The plots are tricky. The detective character is sympathetic, not brutal. He listens to all sorts of people, no matter how zany, and takes notes of odd things, which ultimately gives him information to solve cases, It doesn't always start out a murder investigation, because he is the ""last detective who would be assigned"", but the focus is on his abilities to tie facts together and refusal to be put off so he exposes the criminal in each episode. He is frumpy and polite and a man of personal honour, similar to  Columbo, but he is also kind of a loser in his social life. Nevertheless, he will not give up. Good stuff if you want less noise and less brutality and more ""detecting"".",1484697600,,759,4.622222222222222

He's good at his job and picked on by his under-performing peers.

Personally, I think having his old boss fired and a new boss installed would have made more sense, and I really don't want him with his ex-wife.

Perhaps, most of all, they remind me of perps  and cops I've known. The ""pretty boy"" and the connected lad who get promoted for those attributes and not for their merit -- and they know it and therefore out of their guilt seek to make themselves seem ""better"" and try to bully the fellow who has played by the rules all his career, doggedly working his way to ""solves"" even as he knows he will never be promoted.

But when we got on Roku to watch the 4th episode of series II we were truly dismayed to find that we now had to pay $3.99 per episode after we had seen all the previous ones for free with Amazon Prime.  Needless to say, we will not be viewing the remaining episodes as long as they have a price tag of  $3.99 each.  We are greatly disappointed!",1378512000,,464,4.122222222222222

The thing is that his co-workers are the type that you like to see them fall on their faces.  Peter's character is an outcast because he did something right, even though it was not a popular thing to do and as a result he is delegated to getting the cases no one wants or considers of any value.  Surprisingly, as time after time he solves the cases that turn out to be of some significance, he is still looked at as an outcast. The thing is, one should do that which is right even if it isn't popular and it may make you a laughingstock.

I checked out only because I have a lot of respect for British television which is not only greatly acted and directed but because it seems so much more realistic. Specifically, the female actresses don't look like supermodels, neither than the actors. The detectives look like real detectives and the situations are so much more believable. And before I get to endure some verbal abuse, they are some exceptions in American TV but they are just that, exceptions such as any of Steven Botcho's work. Well back to ""The Last Detective"", great series, believable, with great story lines and very warm characters. I was sorry to see that there was not a season Five.

First, the sound is a bit clearer which is import because there are so many dialects of English spoken it can be challenging to understand what's said.  I found the video quality better as well.  The only real issue is that his wife doesn't really come across as someone to be desired.  She is more often shrewish than confused or ambivalent.  This characterization actually detracts from the progression of the plot rather than enhance it.
It is nice, of course, to see how Tristan has matured.ha.",1371168000,,552,4.708333333333333

The series is about a very smart and persistant detective who is always underestimated.  He is caring and humble and is usually taken advantage of but when he discovers it he is still a sweet upbeat real person.  He is having problems with his wife, played by Emma Amos, a most wonderful actress who plays her part seriously and yet is funny when called for.  All the other detectives are great as well, arrogant, condescending and jealous of ""Dangerous"".  The Last Detective"" is named such because he is the last detective that his boss wants to give a case to.  The only character I didn't warm up to is his best friend who seems a little over the top but I think he is quite popular in England so maybe there's something lost in that translation.

We have no problem understanding him when he speaks, but can't say that for the rest of the cast.  The teasing and sneering gets a little old.  This guy never gives up.

2627506,4,B000H5U5MQ,"The second of the sleeper hit British television mystery series, ""The Last Detective, Series 2,""now finds its way here.  The series, a witty police procedural that we've never had a chance to see televised on this side of the Atlantic, is light-hearted, in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-13/dp/B001V7YZD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 13</a>; or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-Thyme-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000WCN7M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series</a>.  As released here, it consists of four new, full-length puzzlers.  It is based on the Dangerous Davies novels by Welshman Leslie Thomas; was produced by the British firm Granada for Britain's Independent Television (ITV).

 Peter Davison (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Series-1-Collection/dp/B000062XDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection</a>) plays the title character, a rumpled, clumsy, lowly detective constable.  He is called ""Dangerous"" Davies ironically, as he is of hardly any danger to society's criminal elements - he's much more dangerous to his friends, family, and co-workers.  Furthermore, his boss has labeled him the last detective, as in ""You're the last detective I'd ever put on a case, except a crap one.""  And, as if to emphasize his light weight in the greater scheme of things, Davies works in Willesden, an unimportant, out-of-the- way North London precinct.  Nevertheless, working in his plodding fashion, he generally gets his man, or woman, succeeding where his slicker co-workers fail.

Davison gets great support from Sean Hughes (the guy from Eejit records in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/6305622922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>), playing his eccentric friend Mod.  Hughes brings a lot to the character, and makes Mod much more than just a sounding board. The beautiful, and voluptuous Emma Amos does well as Davison's estranged wife Julie; Davison, a born nice guy who doesn't very often come in first, frequently finds himself mending her fences, or plunging her toilets, while she takes off for sunny foreign places with her beau of the minute.  Rob Spendlove gives us a fully-inhabited, full of tics, tough supervisor, Detective Inspector Aspinall.  Charles De'Ath as DS Pimlott and  Billy Geraghty as DC Barrett contribute a great deal to the particular flavor of Willesden's police station.  In addition, the series is chock-full of enjoyable characters, expressing themselves in the typical North London accent, to add to the enjoyable ""local,"" but foreign, flavor.  The series is certainly character-rich and character-driven.

Davies, who's nice even when he's drunk, is unfailingly polite to all.  The mysteries in this second of the series, some of them based directly on the works of Thomas are complex and flavorful.  They are:
1. ""Christine."" Wealthy would-be painter Maurice Leyman dies drunk in a fire while shut up in his studio.  So Davies, with many possible candidates for the perpetrator among the unpopular man's acquaintance and family, faces the classic ""locked door"" mystery.  Even the newly widowed Christine doesn't seem too upset at her husband's death.
2. ""The Long Bank Holiday.""  It's Easter, and Davies had plans. But some computer thefts from government offices, a possible suicide at the rail yards, an absconded lifer on the loose, and a grisly find of human bones in a suburban garden all conspire to ruin the detective's holiday.
3. ""Benefit to Mankind.""  Henry Winton's body is found in a canal.  He seems an open-and shut suicide, with a history of depression, a booze-filled bloodstream, and a high-pressure job in big bucks medical research.  But Davies has a feeling about SwanMed, Winton's employer, particularly when Winton's pretty young coworker goes missing.  This episode guest stars the greatly admired actor David Threlfall, who starred as Smike in ""The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby."" Frankly; he seems wasted in his part here. It also co-stars Susan Wooldridge, who starred as Daphne Manners in ""The Jewel in the Crown.""
4. ""Dangerous and the Lonely Hearts."" A waifish Eastern European girl is brought to the station for shoplifting.  Davies soon finds her pretty mother strangled.  All clues seem to lead to a video dating service, where Davies finds some surprising suspects.

This series is a great find: it's witty, entertaining, and intellectually and emotionally satisfying.  But: and now presents the De Pue closed captions report: there are none, and they are needed. You'll find that the cast does rapid-fire North London dialect, without regard for us country cousins over here. So you're going to have to work at it.",1220572800,,4972,5.952180028129395
2627507,5,B000H5U5MQ,Keep on putting Mr. Davison's work on dvd.  The scripting template is a perfect match for him.  His partner and dawg are perfect.,1218844800,,129,4.565217391304348
2627508,5,B000H5U5MQ,"My only complaint is that each season is only four episodes long!  In season two we get further into Davies's personal life.  In the case of a lot of mystery shows I'd say this would take away from it, but this show has always seemed more about Davies than the mysteries.  He's such an interesting, loveable character (c'mon, don't you just want to feed him tea and cookies?) that the mysteries take a back seat.  This isn't to say they aren't good - they are well-paced and would work even without such a good cast - but they just can't compare with the characters.

Even the side characters (his landlady, his best friend, his dog) are just so unique and interesting, though not in a completely unbelievable, over-the-top way.  The only character I want to dislike is his wife, and somehow I can't even manage that.  You just know there's a lot of storyline left unsaid, and it's going to keep me coming back for more.",1215388800,3,920,4.506024096385542

I had not even finished watching the whole series 1 before I went on line and purchased Series 2 & 3.  Thank you Amazon for supplying  these.  They are not available in N.Z. yet and I just couldn't wait.

The acting is superb.  Understated and brillant. Definitely highly recommended for anyone who who wants to come away from the viewing pondering about human frailities and human relationships. Great characterisations.

I can't recommend this enough. Just loved it.  Does anyone know if a 4th series was ever made.",1181001600,3,669,4.554621848739496
