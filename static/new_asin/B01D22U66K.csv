8754695,3,B01D22U66K,"A beautiful movie to look at, the plot...not so much.  It loosely follows Bocaccio's outline for the 100 stories in ""The Decameron"".  A group of seven young women and three young men decide to leave Florence at the height of the plague in the middle ages, and reside in the country until it's safe to return.  They arrive at a villa, and decide tell each other stories to pass the time.  Although the cinematography, location and costumes are gorgeous, the elegance and lightness of Boccaccio's characters and stories is missing altogether.  Little of the flirtatious tone and use of language to convey subtlety and nuance is put to use.  There is very little character development among the storytellers, and their interactions seem stilted and contrived.  The stories told among the hundred provided by Boccaccio were okay, but there are better ones that could've been chosen.  If you want to see living Botticelli figures and landscapes come to life, this is lovely to look at, but ho hum otherwise.",1471824000,4,1002,4.9226190476190474

Beautiful photography.",1467331200,,92,6.153846153846154
8754697,2,B01D22U66K,This starts promisingly enough but quickly becomes tedious and boring. There is no bawdy or salacious content either as the description falsely indicates. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.,1464998400,3,197,5.6
