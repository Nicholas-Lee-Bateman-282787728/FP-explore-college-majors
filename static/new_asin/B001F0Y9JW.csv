8300303,2,B001F0Y9JW,"I own several other Belly Twins discs which I enjoy very much, but this set was disappointing. I was looking forward to the Bollywood workout especially but I never even broke a sweat. I am no hard-body by any stretch of the imagination and after doing the workout, I didn't feel like I had exercised at all. The Indi-Hop disc was too hard on my knees and didn't really motivate me enough to finish the workout. The quality of the video itself was very poor in that it was blurry, no matter what t.v. setting I used. It gave me a headache just trying to watch and follow along. After only using it a couple of times, I sent it back to amazon as a trade-in.",1417132800,2,656,4.214285714285714
8300304,2,B001F0Y9JW,"They are great if you just want to get moving I guess, but if actually want to learn to dance buy another Dvd. Indihop is really hard on the knees.  Try Hemalaya's workouts instead for Bollywood.",1364947200,,195,4.416666666666667
8300305,3,B001F0Y9JW,"This is a 2-disk set in which you get two separate workout DVDs.

Bollywood: Despite the photo on the cover, Neena is not in this workout. It's just Veena with a male and female. You will learn some Bollywood moves in an easy format, so if you're interested in Bollywood, this could be a good workout for you. What's really distracting is that the lower impact modifications pop up over the three performers. It would have been far better to have Neena in the group actually showing the modifications throughout instead of a video insert that obscures what's going on. Frankly, I'd rather stick with the bellydance workouts than follow along with this one. It's not nearly as fun.

Indi-Hop: Years ago I bought this on VHS and was really disappointed with it because it wasn't the same quality as the Veena and Neena bellydance videos.  But at least Neena is actually in this video. The three-part ""routines"" do give you a cardio workout, not really as low impact as you might expect. I thought the huge group following along was unnecessary. Really, two or three extra performers would have been less distracting. If you like dance workouts, you could easily be bored with this. It's really more of an exercise workout than it is dance.  In short, the workout has a little bit of a kickbox flavor to it, so you might like it if you're not expecting dance routines. But don't expect much else. As for the special features, forget the dance ""bonus."" It's not a bonus. It's a motley gang looking skrungy and overlaid with dizzying and tasteless video effects. Skip it, unless you want to get a headache.

The DVD set: The bargain in this purchase is that you get two DVDs, so if you can pick it up at a discount, then go for it. Just don't expect Veena and Neena in both and don't expect any extras.",1336348800,,1797,4.5510835913312695
8300306,5,B001F0Y9JW,This a great DVD especially since it goes along with a Zumba certification I'm getting ready to get!  The DVD was well packaged and in great shape when I got it.  Thanks a bunch! Suzette,1335225600,,186,4.285714285714286
8300307,3,B001F0Y9JW,"I love that I got two workouts on two discs with this purchase. But the Bollywood Blast disc was a disappointment. It was not a full workout and was over before I could come close to breaking a sweat.

The Indi-Hop disc was a decent workout-about 20 minutes of elevated heart rate plus warm up and cool down.

Bollywood Blast and Indi-Hop are more approachable than the twins' older videos where the only instructions are in voice-over. But they've sacrificed content and a better workout in these two.

I still prefer their Slim Down and Core Conditioning workouts. Even so, the Bollywood Blast and Indi-Hop workouts are mostly low-impact and fun, and I still use the Indi-Hop disc weekly.

Separately, I would rate Indi-Hop with four (4) stars because it could be longer and Bollywood Blast with two (2) stars.",1304899200,2,812,4.7785714285714285
8300308,3,B001F0Y9JW,"Once again another Bollywood workout dvd, yet something is missing. The moves on the dvds are not bad. But there is no Bollywood music!! Please future makers of Bollywood workout dvds, please include Bollywood music to workout to!! Songs like Aaja Nachle, etc.. and moves that go with the songs.",1251504000,9,295,4.92
8300309,4,B001F0Y9JW,"Veena and Neena have done a lot of workout videos and it's always great to see the twins together. At 1st glance, I thought the twins were working together on Bollywood Blast but was surprised that Veena was leading the workout with 2 other dancers. Veena did say that Neena helped to design the moves. That disc lasted for about 26 minutes.  Indi-Hop is also included (which I already have) and lasts for about 34 minutes (including instruction time).

I prefer Indi-Hop because it includes 3 dance routines with different levels of intensity. Bollywood Blast is great for the obliques with the different twists and leg lifts. I did have to add another workout since this one is so short. Doing the 2 discs together would give you more of a complete workout and plenty of yoga stretches.",1236988800,12,788,4.702898550724638
