1.) While the DVD release date or copyright in 2006 may imply recent release this does not accurately reflect the production date.  Actual footage is of older vintage.  That is not to say that the content is not a decent quality.  However, be aware this title may be a bit outdated.

2.) These DVD's are duplicated on DVD-R media and are NOT compatible with all DVD players in all regions.  To avoid a DVD that does not play correctly (or at all) verify any intended player is capable of handling DVD-R media before ordering.

3.) Lift up your senses.  Quick investigation of all reviews provided by Rocky Mountain ""Lisa"" on March 3, 2006 will reveal an identical voice of enthusiastic approval for all LMXMEDIA releases available through Amazon at the time of this review.",1148515200,5,936,4.879746835443038

If you like to escape to exotic places in reality or even in your mind, the Ecotravel films are a must have. Really breathtaking vivid shots of the land and wildlife with amazing music which corresponds so well with the visuals, very pleasing to the senses. You will play them over and over and get lost in them. SOOOO thrilled to get them on DVD!!!",1141344000,2,486,4.180851063829787
