***spoilers ahead***

And let's not foreget Peg's near death scene is very tear-jerking.

***end spoiler***

I like morty. Do you?",1105056000,2,307,4.735849056603773
7891909,1,630560830X,"hello all horror fans! i wanted to warn you about this movie!: its the wors movie ever!!!. common people! in that movie there are 30 years old actors playing 16 year olds! and they suck at it!
the movie is about a stupid woden doll that killes some 16 (or mybe 30) years old kids in halloween!
how can that movie be good!!!
DONT BUY IT!!! ITS A WEAST OF MONEY AND TIME
DONT RENT IT!!! (SAME REASONS)
OR DONT SEE IT!!! TOAL WEAST OF TIME!
THE  ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 1 STAR IS BEACUSE I KNOW WHAT ITS REALLY HARD TO MAKE A MOVIE (EVEN A BAD ONE...)
BUY THE MOVIE VALENTINE INSTEAD!",998006400,,579,4.034782608695652
7891910,4,630560830X,"This could be the beginning of a new series. The killer could be the next  Jason or Freddy! A posessed wood doll who kills people...it's new. But  then, it's the same company which made Jack Frost. The movie is funny and  has a average gore. It's also a low budget move, you can see that. It kind  of reminds me of the first Friday 13th, maybe because Betsy Palmer plays  the characther of Grandma. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone  who like slasher films.",968457600,,472,4.430232558139535
7891911,5,630560830X,"My title states it all!  This movie is pure fun from start to finish!  It's like a TRUE throwback to the days of ""Friday the 13th Part 2""!  You've got random dorky characters spouting off lame esoteric  dialogue then getting killed by the wooden dummy, Morty.  Come on!  You've  just GOTTA love a movie where the killer is named MORTY.  The movie had  everything a guilty pleasures flick has to offer. . .EXCEPT the nudity.  Had the filmmakers added nudity into the film, I would've been even  happier.  But, you can't have everything.  This movie is a LOT  of fun.",951350400,3,565,4.52
7891912,1,630560830X,"A truly poor film. I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters and the film would have been greatly improved if they had all been massacred by the man it the rubber suit that was supposed to look like a  wooden carving. By the way, how many wooden carvings do you know that  blink!  The main male character was the worst of all and made me want to  plunge my hand into the TV screen and strangle him. The acting didn't make  up for any of the other dissapointments; particularly the acting from that  guy who was trying to pull off an English accent.",946512000,,561,4.245283018867925
7891913,3,630560830X,"The key word here is FUN...yes, its not mind-destroyingly original, or acted with Shakespearean aplomb, but if you want that rent LIQUID SKY and Olivier's rendition of the Bard, and play em together on a split screen!  But if you want to cook up a batch of microwave popcorn, and pop something  in the VCR that will make your hottie hold you tight, then this one is for  you! This is a very enjoyable , 'Midnight-Movie' hack-em-up distinguished by  a very cool rap soundtrack featuring such artists as Esham, Insane Clown  Posse , Natas and Gravediggaz. If you know who they are: NUFF SAID! If you  don't know who they are but want to find out, see the movie or buy the  CD:you won't be sorry.",945734400,,693,4.4523809523809526
7891914,5,630560830X,"Horror movies always have something odd that kills people.  In this case, the monster is a wooden statue.  He's actually kind of cute.  Well acted, crisply directed.  I enjoyed it.",939427200,,180,4.9
