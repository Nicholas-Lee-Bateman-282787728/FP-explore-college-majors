4601206,5,B0058O1FIY,"I use to love tom and jerry, when I was a kid and all the sets up till now have been crap, horrible packaging, mediocre remastering,not in chronological order which most people prefer. Overall they were pretty bad, but this fixed up a lot of the problems that we had in the old sets.

I give it a 5/5, I recommend it if enough people buy it we will surely get a second set!",1317686400,5,373,4.04054054054054
4601207,5,B0058O1FIY,"I've always been a fan of classic cartoons from the Golden Age of animation, but have been disappointed with the transfers I've seen up til now.  The colors always seemed a little washed out and faded.  However I recently watched two classic cartoons in high definition (""Rabbit Hood"" and ""Robin Hood Daffy"") which were included as bonus features on the wonderful ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" blu ray.  Wow, talk about a difference!  I couldn't believe how beautiful the colors were.  They just popped!  I assume these cartoons will be treated with the same loving care since they are newly remastered from better source elements.  In fact one of the people involved in the project said, ""It's like the Sistine Chapel.  We've been looking at them through years of varnish and soot. Now [all that] is taken away and the colors just pop.""

I consider this disc, as well as the upcoming Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Vol. 1, to be must own blu rays.  Best of all these cartoons are uncensored and unedited!",1312848000,10,1009,4.780346820809249

Don't be fooled, this isn't you're ordinary Tom and Jerry set because this 2-disc set features the first 37 shorts in chronological order uncut and uncensored and restored and remastered for the first time (I understand the transfer will be remarkable)! Plus, some of these shorts include their original title cards for the first time anywhere on any format! Plus bonus features including 9 commentaries and a new retrospective documentary. Truly the ultimate Tom and Jerry set...ever!",1310515200,100,538,5.056179775280899

4601210,5,B0058O1FIY,WOW GROWING UP I USE TO LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO THE MOVIES ON SUNDAY. GOT TO SEE TOM AND JERRY CARTOONS. I WOULD LAUGH TILL I CRIED  AT THESE TWO SILLY GUYS. I WOULD HURRY HOME AND TELL MY MOTHER ALL ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF TOM AND JERRY..MOM WOULD SMILE AND I AM SURE BEHIND THAT SMILE SHE WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS SAYING MY WORDS RUNNING TOGETHER IN MY EXCITEMENT AS I TOLD MOM THE ADVENTURES OF TOM AND JERRY. MOM'S NO LONGER HERE BUT I WILL BE ABLE TO THINK BACK AND REMEMBER THE LAUGHES AND SMILES THAT CAME OUT OF MY HOUSE BECAUSE OF TOM AND JERRY. IF YOU LIKE CARTOONS YOU WILL LOVE THESE TWO.

4601211,5,B0058O1FIY,"I made no secret of my distaste for the censored version of the Tom and Jerry shorts available on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-and-Jerry-Spotlight-Collection/dp/B0002MFGCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom and Jerry - Spotlight Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD. Not only was history whitewashed to satisfy the PC Brigade (just who ARE these people anyway?) they were also in shocking condition with lots of dirt and scratches and generally terrible picture quality.

All is now fixed for this Blu Ray release from Warner, presenting the first 37 shorts, in chronological order, with brand new 1080p transfers from the best 35mm materials, Dolby 5.1 sound (HD sound is not confirmed at the time of writing, but these cartoons WERE released in Mono anyway and DD 5.1 is still a notable upgrade) and, most importantly, UN-EDITED AND UN-CENSORED. You will finally be able to see the REAL Mammy-Two-Shoes voiced by Lillian Randolph, and various other 'racially inflammatory' visual jokes.

The cartoons included are:

Puss Gets The Boot
The Midnight Snack
The Night Before Christmas
Fraidy Cat
Dog Trouble
Puss N' Toots
The Bowling Alley Cat
Fine Feathered Friend
Sufferin' Cats
The Lonesome Mouse
The Yankee Doodle Mouse
Baby Puss
The Zoot Cat
The Million Dollar Cat
The Body Guard
Puttin On The Dog
Mouse Trouble
The Mouse Comes To Dinner
Mouse In Manhattan
Tee For Two
Flirty Birdy
Quiet Please!
Springtime For Thomas
The Milky Waif
Trap Happy
Solid Serenade
Cat Fishin'
Part Time Pal
The Cat Concerto
Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Mouse
Salt Water Tabby
A Mouse In The House
The Invisible Mouse
Kitty Foiled
The Truce Hurts
Old Rockin' Chair Tom
Professor Tom

This is how it SHOULD have been released the first time around, but this Blu Ray set is an absolute MUST-HAVE for serious animation collectors. Spend the money and let Warner know that this presentation and effort is profitable. It will only grease the wheels for more T&J and perhaps some uncensored HD Looney Tunes.",1309392000,369,2008,5.3249211356466875

Video is full of noise I could say DVDs were much more better than this or even Original work in comparison with this ..

I converted and edited my Bluray and Fixed the Screen Ratio ( Removed the Black Borders ) , I wish I had access to original work and I was remastering it myself the way it deserves .. screenshot from my converted video .. to remove the black boarders you just need to cut the left for 220 pixels and right for 240 ..",1499385600,2,696,3.9714285714285715

I always enjoyed Tom and Jerry as a kid...never thought about ""stereotypes"" then. Still, they are good fun. The Cineascope versions aren't that good..at least here you see the whole picture...on TV it is cut off. I really didn't like the wide screen cartoons and they weren't as funny as the early orginals.

4601272,5,B0058O1FIY,"This is a cool blast from the past. DVDs are a treasure to those who love old T.V. Even if these cartoons could still be found on T.V., they'd be hacked up, so buy the disc. I remember a lot of these blackface gags from when I watched these cartoons on an independent station in the '80s. Back then, when I was a kid, I saw the firecracker blow up I Tom's face, or the car splash mud on the characters and thought, ""Ha ha. That's funny."" And while I understood why their faces were black, I didn't get the brown lips and pigtails. So this teaches two things: 1- Bigotry and racism are learned, and 2- Censorship is for adults. Even as a kid, what happens after Tom splashes water on Mammie (Part Time Pals), or when the cats smack her in the butt (A Mouse In the House), would not have been funny if Mammie was a skinny white girl. So enjoy the violence and the political incorrectness... and the animation- this is also a cool blast from the past when cartoons were works of art.",1463184000,,980,4.218085106382978

Please also note in the early 40s people treated certain subjects differently, but it's nothing too extreme (in my opinion at least). These are the original first 37 Tom and Jerry shorts, in as close to the original theatrical presentation as possible.

As for censorship, none of these cartoons are edited (though it has been said that The Yankee Doodle Mouse had certain wartime gags cut out from the re-release and are also presumed gone forever), so you will see much more than what you ever saw on Cartoon Network.

As for the Tom and Jerry cartoons: they are classics. The timing, rich music from the MGM orchestra, fluid animation, lush backgrounds, and violent gags come together to form animated films worthy of an Oscar, which Tom and Jerry have won 7 times!

It's a tragedy that Volume 2 won't be released because Warner Bros. doesn't understand the historical context of the cartoons as well the target audience for the Golden Collections. Nonetheless, Tom and Jerry Golden Collection is a MUST HAVE for everybody!",1451088000,3,1002,4.786127167630058

So why did it get 5 Stars? Well, these clearly are the Classics, and it has the Original Voice of ""Mammy Two Shoes"", Lillian Randolph. That alone.... is worth the 5 Stars! If you catch these episodes on Cartoon Network or it's sister channel Boomerang, they will only show the updated version, with a different voice actor replacing Lillian Randolph. Still great to see though, but I like things the way they were originally made, unless it's seriously offensive. Moving on, my package arrived on time and was well packaged.

One thing that really intrigues me is the fact that one short, 'His Mouse Friday', is not on this collection or any T&J DVD for that matter. Please someone correct me if I'm wrong. In fact, (again someone please correct me if I'm wrong) I believe the last time it was released on home video was 'Tom & Jerry on Parade' in 1992, but it was edited to remove the dialogue of the African Cannibals. (on a side note, weren't the 1950's late for cartoons to still be containing stereotypes?) First of all, How does this make sense? The Donald Duck short 'Spare the Rod' had black pigmy cannibals who Donald follows around thinking that they are his nephews & when shown on TV, all scenes with them were snipped out making the short 2.5  minutes (not counting credits & thus, ruining the entire story). However, it was included on the finale volume of The Chronological Donald & intact, but the former cartoon is banned altogether. Secondly, why should the whole world suffer just because a few do gooders protest? Many of these edits & bans don't really make sense to me at all.",1430697600,2,1146,4.431279620853081

Thankfully, I was able to download every single Tom & Jerry cartoon FREE! I will not buy, nor rent any of these classic from Amazon for such contempt! Days likes this, I feel ashamed to live in America, full of such hypocrisy of idiocy!

CONS: Do not expect crystal clear HD transfers of the original cartoons. The previews of newer Tom and Jerry animated movies are obviously HD and present well for the BLu-Ray, but the features have not been remastered. To me that does not take away from the cartoons, but you will be disappointed if you are expecting the quality of the cartoons to be the same as a modern HD animated features.

I don't know why our country has become so quick to call things racist as in the case with these videos and the African American woman. Yeah she says ""Thomaus Yous going O-W-T Out"" So what? I don't think the controversy warrants the warner brothers warning at the start. It big corporation covering their backside. At least they did not cut these videos up from their original form. There are plenty of old cartoons depicting white hillbillys and they are not labeled as racist etc. Its just funny to see how people talk. I visited the Ozark mountains and it took me a while to figure out what the people were talking about when they were saying yuns. Yuns going to town?

4601393,5,B0058O1FIY,"I have loved tom and jerry since I was a little kid and though I didn't bother buying the spotlight collections, I'm glad I bought this. All of the cartoons look amazing, plus the cartoons are in chronological order. The best part is that the cartoons are uncensored and uncut. After watching the censored versions on Cartoon Network for years and years, it is a welcome change to see the cartoons uncensored. Another huge plus is the fact that these cartoons feature Lillian Randolph as the voice of Mammy Two Shoes instead of the later voice of Thea Vidale. Randolph was the original voice and did a much better role. Be forewarned that the scenes that were censored may be offensive to some people. This collection contains two Tom and Jerry cartoons that I had never seen before: The Lonesome Mouse and A Mouse In The House. These two were never shown on Cartoon Network so for those like me who have never seen them, these two make the collection worth buying. Here is a complete list of the racist gags in this collection that were unfortunately prevalent in society at the time: a Chinese gag in Puss 'n Toots, a Hitler gag in The Lonesome Mouse, a blackface gag in The Yankee Doodle Mouse (which, strangely enough, is shown on Cartoon Network), an Indian gag in The Mouse Comes To Dinner, a blackface gag in Mouse in Manhattan, an Indian gag in Flirty Birdy, a blackface gag in The Milky Waif (where Jerry is voiced by Lillian Randolph), a blackface gag in A Mouse In The House, an Indian gag in Kitty Foiled,  a blackface gag in The Truce Hurts, and a subtle racist gag in Old Rockin Chair Tom (""take good care of poor old uncle Tom""). This collection has a disclaimer at the beginning that cannot be skipped. The disclaimer simply warns that some content may be offensive. Unfortunately Warner Brothers chose to break the chronological order by omitting Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat from Golden Collection Volume 2. The racist gags in those two cartoons (Tom in blackface in the former and Jerry in blackface in the latter) are no worse than the gags in the cartoons in this collection.

""That lady must be rich!"" they exclaim, ""Her house is so beautiful!"" ""Her refrigerator is always filled with every kind of good food!"" They (and I) love how she takes no nonsense from ""Thomas"". She is a wonderful character. A strong, self-determined woman who is obviously making her way in the world and taking good care of herself. So she is afraid of mice. Where would we be without that.

4601426,5,B0058O1FIY,"Anyone who truly appreciates classic cartoon art should consider this as essential collection material, even with the very touchy subject of racial sensitivity that goes with several of the episodes. I argued what I could write, how I might approach the very fact that the comedy in some of these episodes were at the expense of a nation of people struggling to be recognized as equals. The black face and slow-speaking, from-the-poorhouse drawl is very unsettling to some. Others brush it off, that it was a product of its time, like Amos and Andy. Well, Amos/Andy isn't the world we live in, and I respect those who don't like the characterizations portrayed in some of these episodes.

Being 48 years old at the time of this review, I grew up watching these on Saturday mornings, on the UHF channels. They looked much classier than Popeye and Bugs Bunny. I saw a sophistication in these early Tom and Jerry shorts, because of the care into the detail of the characters, but also in the depth of detail and subtle and refined work put in to the backgrounds. The shading and color is remarkable. This wasn't computer-generated, but hand-drawn cells, frame by frame. It is purely exquisite viewing, with sensitivity sketched and colored into the storytelling for episodes such as Night Before Christmas, Mouse in Manhattan, and Cat Concerto.

Mouse in Manhattan displays storytelling with a heart; but all of these shorts from the classic years have a real fun to them. I do bristle when I see the stereotyping displayed as comedy, but it's simply cemented into what was created in that era, when Blacks couldn't share the same bathrooms or stay in fine hotels, or eat at the same restaurant as Whites.

I have struggled to push the play button to watch the film, ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915), but it's in my film library, because it is a breakthrough film with regards to shooting style, storytelling and composition. I have it, because it was also made in an era even worse for wear by being created 30 years prior to the Tom and Jerry classics.

Why did I give it five stars, even with the things I wrote above? Because this is still the benchmark of animation done right, well, and the way it should be. I really think these shorts will hold their own - the same as the true classic hand-drawn Walt Disney features - against the CGI films, like those made by Pixar and DreamWorks. I wouldn't dare say they're better, or not as good; it would be just as silly as comparing Johnny Unitas to Peyton Manning.

But, I'm glad that the rights owners chose to restore each episode in their original states, and not try to re-dub or trim out some of the offending moments. Being Black, I don't take offense to those scenes, but I wouldn't want to watch them in mixed company.

4601431,4,B0058O1FIY,"I picked up this set on sale locally, which made it a good deal.

Restoration is overall excellent, with no film scratches or anything overtly distracting on the master film.  Granted, with cel animation there WILL be occasional occasional white speaks, white semi-transparent streaking, and other issues, but they are rare and couldn't be removed without a LOT of effort that isn't worth the time.

Color levels and clarity are fantastic.

some film grain, but that's to be expected.  Not enough to distract or detract, but a reminder as to the medium in which they were made.  Modern shows are done digitally, but the grain is benign.

No complaints on sound quality...

Most people seem to remember these cartoons from post-WW2.  What interested me is that these episodes seem to be from the earliest days (early~mid- 1940).  I suspect vol 2 will contain more of the recently made cartoons (~1949-59).

Some of these cartoons are interesting:  The format starts off very simply.  Either the cat or the mouse offends the other and hijinks ensue.  There is no set rule that the mouse is the goodie and the cat is the baddie.  And there is no rule saying there is a level of maliciousness that they must adhere to.  Each can be pretty vile against the other.

Which is why I am looking forward to later cartoons, such as ""Tot Watchers"" (1959 and the final cartoon made under the original run, if I recall rightly).  Cat and mouse work together - but the cat usually gets the brunt of abuse, and note the stereotypes chattering teen who uses the phone, abdicating her babysitting responsibility...  these cartoons, when not showing wonderful cartoon violence, poke fun at the social paradigm of the day as well (in this case, the long lost art of not babysitting).

Collectors of the franchise will love this set due to the care involved.

Casual viewers will undoubtedly be put off by some racism.  What was allowed in 1940 could be VERY offensive.

My two cents:  What I do appreciate is that these cartoons are unedited.  Even if some of the material is offensive.  These are products of their time, complete with social mores, their being lampooned, or their being propped up by playing into offensive stereotypes rather than fighting said stereotypes.  I won't cite examples, but the viewer can usually figure out what is bound to be examples of this.

Racism is obscenely ugly, but this provides an opportunity to teach children how ugly racism is.  To edit out anything perceived as vulgar is pretending it never happened, and history is about learning from one's society's past.  Many cartoons are definitely created in a free-spirited nature, but the more racist ones do allow parents the opportunity to tell children about our collective history and why it was wrong for those situations to have been presented.

That and don't let the occasional vulgar scene decide that every cartoon and every scene within don't have genuinely funny laughs.  Always decide for yourself, but these cartoons are products of their time.  Editing history is immoral.  learning from it, then finding and providing perspective are what matters.

4601443,5,B0058O1FIY,"I first saw Tom & Jerry cartoons on tv in the late '60s, and thanks to my parents, I knew they were ""old"" cartoons because my folks had seen them in their younger years. But there was something about them that didn't seem right--they just weren't as bright and colorful as the Warner Bros. and Disney cartoons that were also on tv. And those faded old prints, along with other unwelcome blemishes, kept showing up in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. For some reason or other, the Mammy Two-Shoes character was ""sanitized"" in just a few of the syndication prints that played in our market, but the old robust Technicolor hues faded down to weak pastels. And when Cartoon Network came along, we had cuts to deal with. And then the laserdisc set perpetuated the weak colors and bizarre idiocy like ""His Mouse Friday"" with music intact but all dialogue removed. The ""Spotlight"" collections were heartbreakers, and the recent ""Best of"" dvd was almost an insult. BUT FINALLY, we have ""Tom & Jerry Golden Collection,"" and if the succeeding volume(s) are as good as Volume One, then Tom & Jerry and their creators have finally been treated honorably.

Most of my enthusiasm is due to seeing the content intact: no ""remedial voiceovers,"" no cuts to remove violence or blackface gags. The comedy content is Tom & Jerry straight up. Most of the prints are very sharp, color-wise. Some exceptions have been noted by other reviewers. While these particular titles don't look as duped-out as they have in the past, viewers will note a grainier texture in the image which tells of substandard material being tweaked-up as far as the elements will permit. It's not terrible, but it is noticeably inferior. The absence of original title cards for several subjects is a bit easier to overlook in light of the completeness of the shorts, but it's still a bit of a sore point, given the artistry that frequently enhanced the openings. It's something like the original illustrations of a book. The text might be complete, but a completist wants the original enhancements, particularly in the case of Mark Twain or Charles Dickens, who actively collaborated with illustrators (or, to use a movie analogy, the opening titles of Laurel & Hardy's ""Blockheads,"" which were drawn by comedian Harry Langdon and are now permanently restored in both the British and American dvd collections).

As far as I can tell, most of the supplemental material in the this dvd set was previously released in the ""Spotlight"" sets, which will make those atrocities all the easier to part with. My only gripe with the new featurette, ""Vaudeville, Slapstick and Tom and Jerry"" is that a couple of the cartoon scenes are from Chuck Jones' Tom & Jerry cartoons; this documentary is supposed to focus on Hanna & Barbera's original creation.

These nits aside, this collection's overall quality is long overdue and thrice welcome. I hope it's a portent of good things to come not just for Tom & Jerry but for the MGM cartoons of Tex Avery as well.",1322352000,2,2991,4.815175097276264
4601444,5,B0058O1FIY,"Tom & Jerry Golden Collection Volume 1

Distributor: Warner Home video (US)

Ask most 30 some-things to name a favourite cartoon from their childhood and the top 2 results would almost certainly be Tom & Jerry and Looney Tunes.

T&J were busy entertaining children the world over for countless years until the world eventually changed and became infused with modern day political correctness, thus branding our favourite cat and mouse team as  no longer suitable for the modern day audiences and forcing cuts to the classic programs which rendered the original animations shades of their former selves.

Released across various media from video to DVD,  the Tom & Jerry animations have long been on  collectors most wanted lists to see them finally released complete in their full original uncensored glory. This eventually resulted in a special edition DVD set which would supposedly mark the first uncut presentation in years. The DVDs however were not without issues. With early volumes having incorrect censored cartoons pressed onto the discs and the final volume missing two cartoons in their entirety, all hope of collectors finally having the versions they so cherished from their childhoods seemed lost. Thankfully Warner Home Video have got it right this time around with a brand new HD Blu-ray release which at last presents 37 early classic animations, fully uncensored in their original full length versions.

Presented in their original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, the animations look altogether excellent in their newly remastered 1080p transfers. Some print damage such as scratches and dust remain throughout the presentation, however this only adds to the nostalgia and the detail and colours are visually impressive, bringing a new depth to the shorts.

Audio is presented in a Dolby Digital 1.0 track which sounds exactly as it should considering the content is actually 70 year old cartoons. Music and occasional dialogue sound clear, leaving no real complaint on the audio front.

Extras are reasonably well represented with 9 of the classic toons having accompanying commentary tracks. Next up are a handful of documentaries/featurettes discussing different aspects relating to the history of Tom & Jerry themselves, followed by pencil test footage and finally a video of Jerry dancing with  Gene Kelly taken from the film Anchors Aweigh

All things considered, this region free Blu-ray set makes a fantastic first HD venture into the Tom & Jerry archives. The toons are presented as they should be which although may displease the moral majority, means that they are now complete with their heart and soul intact which is ultimately what kept them alive for over 70 years in the memories of their legions of fans worldwide. Should further volumes continue to follow suit, then the Tom & Jerry Blu-ray library will prove to be the ultimate set for the collector and serve as an essential time piece of history for a period long since remembered.",1322352000,,2961,5.171548117154812

***** - disc #2 (for both quality & content)

Unlike Warner Brothers Cartoons that used the ""Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies"" logo to tell you that you are watching a re-release print, MGM only put little clues into their titles to give a hint that you are not watching the original.
In this Blu-ray set you will see a variety of logos & title cards which is nice but it also tells us that this is not the way it originally was. Due to a fire in a film archive in the 1970's the original Nitrate Masters are lost, possibly forever. These versions are all that survive.

Here are some clues to look for, the MGM Logo is the biggest clue, followed by the use of the names TECHNICOLOR & PERSPECTA SOUND:

1934 to 1942 = The MGM logo is the regular MGM logo used in feature films,with a BLACK BACKGROUND, followed by a title card that says ""AN MGM CARTOON IN TECHNICOLOR"". 1960's re-prints dropped the name ""TECHNICOLOR"" from this title card.
1942 to 1951 = MGM logo has a bright RED background & the ribbon around Leo is BLUE and the name TECHNICOLOR is written out in SCRIPT font.  For Tom & Jerry Cartoons, the Tom & Jerry logo varies and the commonly seen one with T&J surrounded by orange & red rings was used in the later 1940's. The early 1940's logo no longer exists in prints, but is pictures in the photo section of this listing.
1952 = MGM logo has a bright RED background & the ribbon around Leo is BLUE and the name TECHNICOLOR is written out in PLAIN font.  For Tom & Jerry Cartoons,T&J are surrounded by orange & red rings in their logo.
1953 to 1956 = MGM Logo now has a bright BLUE background. (A few early 1953 cartoons still have the 1952 MGM logo but changed the Tom & Jerry logo.) The Tom & Jerry logo has now changed to a Blue one with the sleeker re-drawn Tom. Some older cartoons got this logo when re-issued.
1956 to 1958 = same as 1952 to 1956, but now there is a sound credit for ""PERSPECTA SOUND"" in the opening credits. older cartoons re-issued at this time have this new credit.

Starting in 1952, technicolor switched over to a single multiple layer color negative on safety film stock. So the 1940's cartoons that were re-issued in 1952 will look better because there was no need for MGM to make a dupe negative to make Eastman Color prints, the new single Technicolor negative could be used. This keeps release prints one generation closer to the originals. And explains why disc #2 looks so much better.
In 1958 MGM abandons TECHNICOLOR and opens up their own ""Metro Lab"" using Eastman Color negatives. MGM transfers ALL of their YCM color seperation negatives made before 1952 to single strip Eastmancolor negatives to print at their labs. They remove all reference to ""TECHNICOLOR"" in the opening titles.

1959 to 1967 = MGM logo returns to the BLACK Background with the word CARTOON in big letters at the bottom. There is NO mention of the name TECHNICOLOR. Newer cartoons will make reference to ""MetroColor"" but older cartoons being re-issued will make no color reference at all. The last credit sequence used for re-release will continue to be used in these prints, meaning some prints may still retain the name ""PERSPECTA SOUND"" even if that process is no longer in use, and the Tom & Jerry logo will reflect it's last re-issue version, either red or blue.

So based on all of this information, here is what we have on these Blu-ray discs:

DISC #1
(1940)
PUSS GETS THE BOOT = All original looking titles BUT ""TECHNICOLOR"" has been removed from the second title card (shown in a freeze frame), so this is a 1960's re-issue.
(1941)
MIDNIGHT SNACK = No original titles here, but ""Technicolor"" is present. Blue MGM & T&J Logo with PERSPECTA SOUND in the credits make this a 1956-1958 re-issue.
NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS = this appears to be the only original 1940's issue print here. The T & J logo is a holiday variation of the early 1940's logo.
(1942)
FRAIDY CAT & DOG TROUBLE = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.
PUSS 'N TOOTS = 1960's MGM logo in black with NO technicolor name. Blue T&J Logo with PERSPECTA SOUND credit. This is a 1960's re-print of a 1956 re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture.
BOWLING ALLEY CAT = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture.
FINE FEATHERED FRIEND = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.
(1943)
SUFFERIN' CATS = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture.
LONESOME MOUSE = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture.
YANKEE DOODLE MOUSE = 1943 Academy Award re-issue titles used just after the cartoon won the award.
BABY PUSS = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.
(1944)
ZOOT CAT = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture.
MILLION DOLLAR CAT = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture. WASHED OUT COLOR!
BODY GUARD = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.
PUTTIN ON THE DOG = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture. WASHED OUT COLOR!
MOUSE TROUBLE = 1960's MGM logo in back with NO Technicolor name. Red T&J logo.  This is a 1960's re-print of a late 1940's re-issue which accounts for the grainy picture.
(1945)
MOUSE WHO CAME TO DINNER = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.
MOUSE IN MANHATTAN = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.
TEE FOR TWO = Red MGM logo with Technicolor in script. Red T&J logo is that of the late 1940's.

DISC #2 is easy to evaluate, almost all are Technicolor re-issues from 1952 to 1956 & look GREAT!
FLIRTY BIRDY = Red MGM logo with TECHNICOLOR in regular lettering. Red T&J logo. This MGM logo was only used with this T&J logo in 1952, so it would be a master from that release.
QUIET PLEASE = 1960's MGM logo in black with NO Technicolor name. T & J credit is over the 1945 Acadamy Award Winner notice. 1960's re-print of 1945 award winner re-issue.
--from this point on ALL cartoons have the Blue MGM Logo with TECHNICOLOR and the Blue Tom & Jerry logo from 1953 to 1956 release unless noted--
(1946)

I wonder why WHV stopped at 37 cartoons and did not finish out the 1948 year, the last cartoon MOUSE CLEANING would have been a jewel to have as it was omitted from the last DVD release.  I hope it was just an oversight ant it will be released in the Blu-ray Volume 2 set (if there is one).

You will notice that the ""Tom"" pictured in the Blue Tom & Jerry logo title card does not resemble the ""Tom"" in any of these 1940's cartoons, in the logo he is the streamlined ""Tom"" of the 1950's and reinforces the fact that these are not the original title cards.  In the documentary How Hanna & Barbera met Tom & Jerry you can see the story boards for ""LITTLE ORPHAN"" (1949), which will be on the next set, clearly visible is the intended Tom & Jerry title card showing the T & J heads inside the orange & red circles.  This was clearly the late 1940's title card, not the blue one you see in the films here.

4601447,5,B0058O1FIY,"While i still haven't bought this collection (i have to economize for the moment) i think it's great news for classic cartoon fans and another proof that Warner can release full (i understand this to be the first of the series), unedited  and chronologicall collections, even of previously released ones like Tom and Jerry-and resuming my mantre: please, Warner, do the same with the Looney Tunes! thank you.

update: I have bought it some months ago. i remember some of the cartoons in the collection from childhood, like ""The bodyguard"" (if you need me, just whistle!) and ""Million Dollar cat"" (but I'm happy!). its amazing how these cartoons look so great even after 70 years. my personal treat is to see signs of the time they were made: WW II refrences (like a picture of Tom turned to Hitler in ""The lonsome Mouse""), jazzy music, an african american maid (I understand her voice was changed in previous releases; how hypocritical!). I understand vol. 2 will be released in 2013 and will contain ""Mouse Cleaning"" (not on previous US collections) and other edited or censored cartoons.

All of those edits and censorship (which were applied also to Looney Tunes and Popeye) is both stupid (trying to make belive the past didn't exist) and wrong (cartoons, like all art, should be released in the exact same way their creators made them). why can't american corporations, Like Turner and Disney (which still have not released the unedited 'Fantasia' or a DVD of 'Song of the South') leave people to decide for themselves what they want to see? *It should be made unlawful to mishandle cartoons for whatever reason, or prevent them from being broadcast or relaesed on home video!*",1321920000,11,1682,4.874125874125874

Other than that, I have no gripes. Too bad, though, that such classic cartoon characters were given the bum's rush by Warner Home Video. F'rinstance the spotty Spotlight Collection and the other DVD cartoon collections that repeated these cartoon collections again and again (Greatest Chases, Whiskers Away, Fur Flying Adventures). But with this collection we will have the untampered with ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""His Mouse Friday.""",1320710400,,616,5.17
4601450,5,B0058O1FIY,I had refused to buy the old DVD collections and am now glad I did! I am NOT a PC type of guy (seems people go out of their way nowadays to be offended) and won't bother with edited/censored stuff. Here they are in all their glory the way they always should have been. Plus the shows themselves look great AND I have the DVD NOT the blue ray so I can imagine that the blu ray looks even better!,1320451200,14,394,3.9375
4601451,5,B0058O1FIY,"THIS is how classic cartoons should be treated in hi-def! Completely uncut and with all the beautiful film grain left intact. No grain- or lineart-erasing noise reduction and with a high bitrate to let all the grain and fine detail flourish. I feel like I'm watching actual film prints of these classic animated shorts. And best of all, the Tom and Jerry cartoons are finally being released uncut and in chronological order, including the very first official-nonofficial Tom and Jerry short, ""Puss Gets the Boot"", in which Tom is referred to as Jasper (and Jerry, while not named in the cartoon, is officially known as Jinx). Also, far as I can tell, the original title cards remain, although the unfortunate ""Academy Award winner of 1943"" card for ""The Yankee Doodle Mouse"" is still here; I'm unsure what the original card looked like.

The only real big gripe I have are the ""hairs"" which frequently crop up in the gate. They can be a little bit distracting. The occasional dirt and emulsion scratches I can deal with, but gate hairs are a bit bothersome. Some manual cleanup work would have been appreciated, but I'd rather have untampered-with transfers than ones which were carelessly slapped with noise reduction. Guess we can't always have things perfect.

This is the finest example of how classic cartoons need to be treated on Blu-ray: no ""politically correct"" editing and censorship (I could do without the preachy text introduction, but in today's sensitive world it is perhaps necessary) and brazenly showing their filmic roots. Disney really ought to take notes.

Here's hoping this is the first in a trend of amazing WB animated Blu-rays. I really hope that the ""Looney Tunes"" collections look this good and that we'll be seeing a great number of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons looking like this on the format before long. (WB, if you're reading this, ya REALLY, REALLY need to redo all the Droopy cartoons in HD and with no art-destroying DNR.)

Addendum: There is a noted issue of certain shorts (nine of them, I believe) looking a little on the dull side regarding color timing. It's the opposite of the Spotlight Collection DVDs, where these shorts were over-saturated and overbearingly colorful (Tom becomes blue instead of gray; on the Blu-rays, he's more of a really dark gray). A nice middle ground would have been ideal, especially for the preserving of some background art detail that unfortunately is affected, but it's not an issue that will lessen the quality of the product for most, nor is it a problem for myself; I prefer the way these shorts look on this Blu-ray set over the previous DVDs, just for the gain in overall detail and film-like appearance.",1320364800,3,2690,4.87964989059081

4601453,5,B0058O1FIY,"I never got over loving animation, so I think it's great to see the classics appearing in high definition.  This set gets a lot of things right.  The films are shown in their correct aspect ratio.  The producers cleaned things up and corrected faded colors, but didn't pile on excessive digital cleaning or boost the colors unnaturally.  They're presented in chronological order, which works quite well for Tom & Jerry.  They're uncensored.  And. . .  The price is right.

There's a small bit of controversy that has emerged.  Most of the numbers in this set look wonderful.  A few of them were allegedly transferred from sub-standard film sources.  The original master films were lost in a fire long ago.  I'm no expert, and  I can only tell you what my uneducated and untrained eyes are seeing on my own HDTV.  I can see the increased amount of film grain in some of these, and it does sometimes get noticeable.  Once in a while the lines may not be quite as sharp, or the colors or exposure may be subtly off.  However. . .  From where I sit, it's all nitpicking.  Even the worst of them are very watchable, and in fact much better than the ones I've seen shown on TV.  If you watch these films looking for flaws, then you'll find a few flaws.  If you watch these films for enjoyment, you should enjoy them.

I find the warning screen a bit annoying.  It's the one that tells about the racial stereotypes and how they're all wrong and bad, but we won't censor them because pretending those attitudes never existed would be even worse.  OK.  I appreciate the explanation, but I just wish I wasn't forced to stare at it for a full minute when I start up the disc.  Anyhow, that's soon forgotten when the cartoons start rolling.

To sum things up:  Don't let the nitpicks turn you away from this set!  It's a piece of history, it's a bargain, and on the whole it's quite well done.  It should make a good appetizer for the Looney Toons Platinum Collection, which is coming up soon!",1319846400,10,1981,4.470588235294118
4601454,4,B0058O1FIY,"It great these cartoons are presented in order and complete, however, I usually buy blu-ray's because of the high picture clarity. Although I am sure it is the norm for painted cell photography - I just could not believe the grainyness. The opening lion and title screens are great, but the actual cartoon are terribly grainy.

Update - After watching a few more, It appears not all of the cartoons are grainy.",1319760000,3,410,4.694444444444445
4601455,4,B0058O1FIY,"TOM & JERRY GOLDEN COLLECTION VOLUME ONE is essentially what we should have been getting since day one. Tom & Jerry: uncut, uncensored, and in chronological order. No skipping around, no elimination of Mammy Two Shoes (the black maid seen in many a short), no versions edited for TV. This is also pretty much every T&J short worth owning, as almost all of the series' strongest entries are present and accounted for.

On top of that, these are newly remastered from second generation CRI elements. Quick recap: the original negatives to the MGM cartoons were destroyed in a fire decades ago. So there's no chance of any MGM cartoon release looking as excellent as the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION or WALT DISNEY TREASURE releases. But, the best CRI elements can look as close as possible to the original negs as possible. For the most part, the best CRI elements were used for the transfers seen here. They look absolutely stunning, and easily the cleanest and colorful transfers of the T&J shorts ever issued.

Unfortunately, not all of the CRI elements are good. I should be clear that there isn't a single set of CRI elements, but several, and as many as two or three per cartoon. The lesser of these CRI negatives can look serviceable to absolutely putrid because they were made on the cheap for early syndication. (Hence these versions having later Metrocolor title cards with no reference to Technicolor, as there was no intention of them ever replicating it.) Seeing these versions mastered for Blu-Ray is akin to if WHV decided to remaster the old Turner material of the 1940s Warner shorts in high-def.

The offending shorts are as follows:

""Puss n' Toots"", ""The Bowling Alley Cat"", ""Sufferin' Cats"", ""The Lonesome Mouse"", ""The Zoot Cat"", ""The Million Dollar Cat"", ""Puttin' on the Dog"", ""Mouse Trouble"", ""Quiet, Please!"", and ""The Milky Waif"".

This may seem trivial, but a lot of these are some of the best T&Js, and it's like night and day when you compare them to the absolutely brilliant transfers that dominate this collection. I sincerely hope Warner Home Video will be more careful, as this ineptitude ruined what could have easily been a 5 star release.

Regardless of the flaws, the majority of the cartoons are _perfect_, as I've stated. No cuts, no DVNR, and in order of release. For barely $20, how could you possibly go wrong?",1319587200,15,2351,4.835820895522388
4601456,5,B0058O1FIY,"Tom and Jerry is one of my favorite cartoons, these cartoons never get boring.

So when I was browsing amazon and saw that they were releasing a brand new remastered collection of the classic cartoons, I simply had to buy it! The quality of the cartoons is great, the picture is clear and crisp. However there are some shorts that have a bit of a grainy quality to them. It's like some shorts were really remastered and some shorts were not very well remastered. But most of the Tom and Jerry shorts on here are very clear.

If you own previous collections of Tom and Jerry, then I don't know how interested you would be in buying this. But for me, since I don't have any of the previous collections, this was a must have.

I love the Christmas one, it stands out amongst the rest for me, because it's very heartwarming. I'm looking forward to volume two (I want more episodes with Spike and with that duckling, I don't remember if it had a name lol).

Hilarious classic cartoons, presented in their original form",1319587200,3,1013,4.45945945945946
4601457,3,B0058O1FIY,"Right. These are brand-new restorations, sourced from great second-generation CRI elements which look much better with whatever you have seen on TV or past DVDs.

Right. The original negatives of all shorts before 1951 are lost. In the case of Tom and Jerry, original negatives equals original title cards.

But the good news is that back in 2009, the original titles of The Midnight Snack, Puss n' Toots, Mouse Trouble, The Zoot Cat and Fraidy cat were discovered by David Gerstein.

The bad news, is that The Midnight Snack and The Zoot Cat are confirmed now to still be with reissue titles here.

Right. These original titles are from private prints most likely. But Warner could and should have been convinced the owner/s to lend them. Warner are not a layman, they're a big corporation with a lot of money.

So, if you look forward to see these titles:

Trust me, you're gonna be disappointed.",1319328000,7,898,4.7612903225806456
4601458,5,B0058O1FIY,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --The first attribute is the chronological structure, which I imagine many fans (myself included) will be thrilled about. The first 37 Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts (beginning with their 1940 debut ""Puss Gets the Boot"" and continuing through the 1948 installment ""Professor Tom"") are presented in order over two Blu-ray discs, and it finally gives us an easy way to observe the subtle evolution of the characters over the years. The first impression one gets from watching these early Hanna-Barbera installments is that the famously antagonistic dynamic between the characters was firmly in place from the very beginning; there aren't any of those odd early shorts in which the characters feel like mere shadows of the icons they would eventually become (despite the fact that Tom looks a little strange and is named ""Jasper"" in his very first outing).

Animation purists will be pleased to note that this collection has indeed preserved the shorts as they were originally released, meaning that some of them do indeed contain moments of racial insensitivity. It's a little startling to see occasional gags with the characters in blackface or moments in which cheap shots are taken at other cultures, but as the disclaimer at the beginning of the disc notes, to remove these moments would be the same as pretending they never existed. They also serve as a valuable peek into the era in which the shorts were made; a snapshot of societal norms which we have thankfully put behind us. Parents may want to use discretion before showing some of these shorts to their kids (at the very least, some of this material might serve as a valuable discussion-starter), but it's for the best that these shorts have been preserved in their original form.

Still, the most exciting thing about this set is that we finally have the opportunity to watch these shorts in hi-def. While there are admittedly shorts which look a little soft, dingy or weathered, there's no doubt that these remastered shorts look dramatically better than ever before. The level of detail is superb throughout; one can fully appreciate the busier moments of animation. Colors have a lot of pop, and blacks are deep and inky. It's such a pleasure to see these 'toons looking so terrific. Audio is also strong, with the energetic Scott Bradley scores holding up rather well after all these years and blending nicely with the chaotic sound effects thrown into the mix. Supplements are generous, kicking off with nine audio commentaries featuring assorted animation experts. You also get the previously released featurettes ""How Bill and Joe Met Tom and Jerry"" and ""The Comedy Stylings of Tom and Jerry,"" plus the new featurette ""Vaudeville, Slapstick and Tom and Jerry."" Finally, you get the dance sequence featuring Jerry and Gene Kelly from Anchors Away and a ""The Midnight Snack"" pencil test.
