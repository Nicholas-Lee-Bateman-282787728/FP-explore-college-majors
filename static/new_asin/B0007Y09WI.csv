8053827,4,B0007Y09WI,"Didn't realize this series was so dark, but it's quite amusing.",1425945600,,63,4.818181818181818

8053829,5,B0007Y09WI,"This is a funny, funny weird ensemble of characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it,  and if you enjoy and understand Britcoms, you can't lose!",1395273600,,153,4.846153846153846
8053830,5,B0007Y09WI,The DVD arrived very quickly in good condition. The Special itself is so funny that one will laugh out loud throughout the entire episode. I recommend the Gentlemen for any one that loves British comedy at it's very best!,1329004800,3,221,4.6923076923076925
8053831,5,B0007Y09WI,"Dave, you're my wife now...

An amazing treat. But you should probably watch the rest of The League of Gentleman series before watching this",1303171200,3,140,4.833333333333333
8053832,5,B0007Y09WI,"this is one of the funniest scariest dramatic well written movies i have ever seen. i figured it would be mostly comedy/satire based on the sitcom, but its actually really really dramatic and gripping. its really cool.",1258675200,3,218,4.918918918918919
8053833,5,B0007Y09WI,"FINALLY....that question has been answered!!  Herr Lipp is featured, along with his wife and choir (pronounced ""queer"") boys.  This is by far the funniest of the three stories (the others featuring charlie/stella and Dr. Chinnery).  If you're a fan of Herr Lipp (who isn't?), this is a must purchase.

Be warned that this is more like Series 3, and it's pretty dark (duh) for a Christmas Special.",1114992000,7,396,4.865671641791045
