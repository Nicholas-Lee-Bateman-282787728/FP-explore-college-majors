8750888,3,B01BO5RU3E,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

EVIL SOULS is one of those movies you have to watch a couple of times, just to make sure you didn't miss something.  I say this because I had to skip backwards a few times to put certain things together.  And while this detracted from the movie as a whole, I have to confess I actually enjoyed the film for the most part, even despite the backtracking.  EVIL SOULS is not a great film, but I still found it entertaining and worthwhile.

A movie like this is sometimes hard to review.  The concept is sound, but the execution lacks a bit, and as a result, the movie itself suffers.  Still, despite its flaws, I enjoyed it nonetheless.

EVIL SOULS is shot fairly well and looks good onscreen.  The sound, however, lacks quite a bit.  I had a very hard time hearing certain speakers (primarily Valentine).  I had to keep changing the volume level on my surround sound, which got annoying pretty fast.

The acting in EVIL SOULS is fairly decent, with Peter Cosgrove giving a wickedly fun performance as Valentine.  Despite some lame dialogue, Cosgrove has a lot of fun with his character, and it shows onscreen.  The rest of the cast does a decent job, particularly Julian Boote, who plays Father Albert.

There are only a handful of special effects scenes we are given, but they look pretty sharp for the most part.  Theres a smidge of gore, and its respectable.  I like the dismembered torso shown towards the beginning; it is particularly gruesome and well done.

The story in EVIL SOULS is where I have the most problems.  I was confused for most of the film as I struggled to understand what was going on and the correlation between the characters.  As it concluded, I finally understood where the writer was trying to go, but the translation from page to screen didn't quite work.  A good horror/thriller will unveil key pieces to the plot at the right points, which leads the viewer on a journey.  EVIL SOULS, unfortunately, never reveals what it needs to for the viewer to understand the happenings.  As a result, the audience is left with many questions and few answers.

Still, despite its faults, I did enjoy EVIL SOULS.  Im not sure if I can heartily recommend it, but it is worth giving a shot, if you're willing to overlook certain details.",1467244800,,2323,4.580097087378641
8750889,1,B01BO5RU3E,"Valentine (Peter Cosgrove) is a Marquis de Sade wanna-be who kidnaps and tortures women complete with costume and harpsichord music. The characters in the film are the adults from the black and white childhood scene where Albert, the future priest, didn't participate. We don't know why, but he didn't. There seems to be a ghost story, demon story, and one of a satanic cult. Valentine's rambles on during the film and doesn't say much. There was no way to identify with the characters from the little to no build up. The ""horror"" aspect consisted of a lot of quick facial close-ups with some ominous music as well as the quick jerk camera with ominous music, generally without us knowing why the kid's furrowed eyebrows are supposed to frighten us more than Brooke Shields' eyebrows.  The acting wasn't there.

Then there was the twist ending which could have made a good horror film a classic, but just made this one worse.

This is what the film says about itself ""A child is born with a prophecy preordained. The guardian of the room unleashes his wrath on those who challenge his will. His evil soul knows no boundary as he ravages his sister in sexual gratification, selling her to the highest bidder. Fate is written, but Valentine has to fulfill his destiny. kidnapping two girls he is intent upon unleashing hell, until a priest, sensing ancient evil, knows he must find a way to stop it. With subterfuge, hate, denial and lust, the journey to a room of terror has just begun.... ""

Some of this information comes late and most of which is not clear. Peter Cosgrove's character really sucked.
