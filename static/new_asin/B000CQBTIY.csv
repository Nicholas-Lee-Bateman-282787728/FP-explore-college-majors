8100316,5,B000CQBTIY,"When I think of Playboy, I come up with an image of Dorothy Stratten, Playmate of the Year 1980. I think her cover for June 1980 is perhaps the best Playmate of the Year cover ever, or at the very least in the top 3 since they started the tradition. I was 13 when I had heard of Dorothy Stratten. She was in a Sci-Fi spoof called ""Galaxina"". Cable TV had just come out and it wasn't long before this movie made it's way onto that. I was mesmerized by her and her natural beauty. This video is a wonderful biography on her life and it comes from the aspect of Playboy, but with Dorothy herself talking about her photo sessions and life in general. Several good songs are played as background music and they provide the mood for the scenes depicted. I couldn't help but hold back a few tears watching this, knowing that Dorothy, a 20 year old from Canada would be so tragically murdered by her estranged and insanely jealous husband that she wanted a divorce from. You see, Paul saw himself as losing her and couldn't imagine the world that he had introduced her to would take her away from him. So, in his mind, to take Dorothy away from him, meant if he couldn't have her, no one else will. Dorothy's mistake was confronting him by herself knowing perhaps it would not be easy talking to Paul about leaving their relationship for good.  This is a well done story with Hugh Hefner also, visibly moved and appeared to have a hard time talking about her and her tragic death. ANY Dorothy fan will want to have this video in their collection! Truly one of the earliest Playboy videos.

This was released on video sometime in 1985. (It does dupe over to DVD format if you have a VHS/DVD recorder.) It comes out nicely!",1433376000,,1713,4.383647798742138
8100317,5,B000CQBTIY,This movie has terrific scenes of Dorothy when she was alive taken at many Playboy functions.  (It also has video of the real Paul Schneider) I recommend it to anyone who liked Star 80 but wanted the real story.  Seller was great too.,1313539200,,234,4.4186046511627906
8100318,4,B000CQBTIY,"The 4 star rating has to do mostly with the morbid fascination I have with the Dorothy Stratten story (being that it has the two main components - sex and death - that can prove interesting to most people). Purchased this after having seen Star 80 and Death Of A Centerfold, along with having read The Killing Of The Unicorn, Picture Shows: The Life and Times of Peter Bogdanovich and Teresa Carpenter's excellent 1980 Village Voice article Death Of A Playmate. In addition, I've seen virtually all the movies and tv show guest spots Stratten appeared in. The Playboy Production Dorothy Stratten The Untold Story was made a year or so after many of the biopics, books and articles of the Stratten story were released/published. One feature all of those shared was painting a portrait of Hugh Hefner and Playboy that wasn't very flattering. The Untold Story does come across as more than a bit biased in Playboy's favor, as virtually all the interview subjects (including Stratten) either worked for Playboy or had an obvious self-interest in painting Paul Snider as solely 100% responsible for Stratten's death. Snider obviously was the man who pulled the trigger, and I suspect he would have been capable of doing that had Stratten chose to leave him regardless of her Playboy notoriety and budding film career. However, had Stratten never went onto success with Playboy (and, in turn, had never broke into tv and films), who knows? Snider might have just moved onto some other girl. The point being that neither Hefner, Bogdanovich (who Hefner shows remarkable restraint in commenting on in the video considering the rape allegations Bogdanovich threw his way) nor anyone else murdered Stratten but Snider. However, to pretend that the involvement with Playboy and Bogdanovich had nothing to due with unintentionally creating the circumstances (Stratten becoming successful and then wanting to leave Snider) under which Snider finally and pathetically lost his marbles is disingenuous at best. It's a glimpse into the cocooned delusions of Hefnerworld, and Stratten at times sounds like her comments were the result of Playboy public relations memorization more than spontaneous recollection. The useful part is in actually being able to see clips and interviews of Snider and Stratten at the Playboy mansion interacting with Hefner, as well as interviews of people outside of the Playboy bubble who knew Stratten and Snider. Possibly the biggest surprise is how Snider is presented as far more humanized than many of the Stratten biopics and books presented him (where he's little more than an 'evil monster'). Pathetic and leechsome, to be sure, but not just the devil incarnate. In terms of nudity, The Untold Story is fairly tasteful; only several minutes of filmed outtakes of Stratten posing for Playboy are included, and 99.9% of that is strictly topless. Basically a solid visual companion to much of the material I'd been reading about (includes footage of Stratten's mother, sister and brother in addition to Snider and clips of Stratten's various tv and film appearances), although the content is a bit skewed in favor of Playboy.",1261612800,,3143,5.116731517509727
8100319,4,B000CQBTIY,"I agree with everything Larry wrote in regards to Dorothy Stratten and this video.  She is clearly one of the most beautiful women to ever grace Playboy, and her story and death at such is young age is tragic.  I actually brought the August 79 Playboy issue when it first came out!

However, we must remember that though Dorothy speaks in her own words, she was working for Playboy at the time, and this tape is a Playboy production.  She expresses joy and pride in being with Playboy, and Hef is viewed as a loving father figure.  Of course, the book written by Peter Bogdonovich (is that spelled right?) claims that Dorothy hated the whole Playboy experience, and was constantly pressured by Hugh Hefner to become one of his special ""ladies"".  Knowing Hef's love for young beautiful buxom blondes, it's easy to believe Peter's claims.  Likewise, knowing Peter's continued obsession with Dorothy, it's easy to believe Playboy's claim that Peter--in his guilt of how his affair with Dorothy played some part in her murder--used Playboy and Hef to place blame.  The truth probably falls somewhere in the middle--more towards Peter's version of events.  As beautiful as she is, and as tasteful as the shots are in the video, Dorothy never looks comfortable.  Even her moments of ""fun""--when she's posing for the POTY photos and laughing and laughing and laughing--it seems faked, as if she is being directed to 'laugh and have fun'.",1165968000,2,1430,4.871900826446281
8100320,5,B000CQBTIY,"Dorothy Stratten was the 1980 Playboy Playmate of the year who was murdered by her abusive, possessive ,estranged, husband. Two movies were made about her life ""Star 80"" and ""Death of a Centerfold"". I have been a Dorothy fan for many years and this is one of the best documentaries about her life. It shows  very tasteful footage of Dorothys Playboy photo sessions, Interviews from Dorothy herself, interviews from those who knew Dorothy. Rare footage of a beautiful luminace Dorothy getting her Playmate of the year award at a press party just months before her death. Dressed in gold, and set to a backdrop of great songs like ""You are so beautiful"", ""Memories"", and Stevie Wonders ""Isnt She Lovely"".. Her Beauty is timeless and story is tragic. When watching this Its hard to hold the tears back at certain points. Dorothy simply was the  sweet, shy, gentle, girl next door. I have also read the book by Dorothy's boyfriend Peter Bogdanovich ""The Killing of the Unicorn"" , Written a few years after Dorothys death, Peter was hurt and raw with emotion, pointing blame at anything (namely Playboy) to make sense of the loss of Dorothy. Although I do understand Peters feelings, I myself point blame only on Dorothys estranged Husband Paul, (whom Mr. Hefner had cautioned Dorothy not to marry just a year earlier.) I agree that Dorothys feelings for Playboy may have been a bit mixed. Dorthy was not an exhibitionst and may have been a bit self conscious at times, like many other Playmates. In the video footage She seems to me to be comfortable in the photo shoot but no one can see what is really in ones heart. Dorothys sister Louise has said that Dorothy liked Hugh Hefner and considered him a friend. The fact remains that Dorothys life was a mix of contradictions. Although Playboy may have not been Dorothys chosen start to a carrer in Hollywood, it opened Dorothy up to many opportunities. Within a year Dorothy made appearances on several major TV shows and Hollywood films. She did more than any other Playmate of her time. Her last movie ""They All Laughed"" she costarred with John Ritter and director boyfriend Peter Boganovich, was excellent. Dorothy was only 20 years old when she died, a tragic loss to all those who knew and loved her. Rest in  peace sweet Dorothy.",1143417600,4,2281,4.755050505050505
