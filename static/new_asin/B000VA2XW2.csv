I love the artistic approach to unvieling the scientific method pursued by the scientists in the film.  Way to go! Great science, great filmmaking.",1241395200,3,303,5.06

Unfortunately, the beetle he seeks was only found one time by one person thirty years ago in one hole in the ground, and it's only about a millimeter long. While the graduate students dig and all sift through mud, dream sequences, animation, and stock footage open a window into the obsession and passion that drives these impossible tasks of science. The ""science"" of clear and instant results is dissolved to reveal the reality where methods are bizarre and failure is not only common, but just another step in the process.",1188086400,,568,4.747474747474747
