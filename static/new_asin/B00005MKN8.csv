1626489,1,B00005MKN8,"Onboard camera scenes tend towards showing one of the racers weaving through the starting grid prior to a race, pulling into the pits during a race, and cars going 30kph or less pulling off the track after a mechicanical failure. Very few on board shots at racing speed. The ""PITS"" sections isn't about pit activity during a race, but about who is watching the monitors and milling around the pits before and during a race. Conversations with drivers rarely occurs. From all the available race footage, it appears that the really interesting stuff was witheld for other purposes.",1002844800,,579,4.918367346938775
1626490,4,B00005MKN8,"This DVD provides very clear image, on-board cam, pit and track coverage. However, it does not provide enough in-depth pre/post-race interview as you normally find in official F1 review VHS video (that usually costs $30+). I was expecting the continuous version to be the same as the official F1 review VHS, but I was wrong. So be prepared on what you are going to buy. But the never-seen before track view angle, on-board cam and pit lane activities do seem very interesting.",1002240000,4,476,4.817073170731708
1626491,3,B00005MKN8,"I must have gotten a bum copy.  For several of the races featured on the disc, the video quality is extremely poor.  The screen will flicker about every second.  In their coverage of the Indy race, the top 1/3rd of the screen just shows some garbled mess that never moves throughout their coverage!  This mess only happens in 3 races, but it's still very annoying.  The coverage of the other races comes in crystal clear.",1002067200,3,421,4.56
1626492,1,B00005MKN8,"Do not compare this 'review' to the official F1 review videos released each year (not yet available on DVD).
This DVD is really only a race highlight package of the 2000 F1 season. It has some excellent on-board footage - not normally seen by analog TV viewers - and some good on track action but it lacks the kind of depth most F1 fans would want.
There is NO qualifying footage, no pre-race interviews or news and no between race updates (ie team changes, new developments etc) that you would normally have in a *normal* review video.
I also believe that the menu system is the poorest I have yet seen on any DVD.
It's my opinion that this DVD was produced only to bundle with the F12001 game for the Sony PS2 and that its subsequent stand alone release was an ill conceived afterthought.",1001894400,,790,4.455172413793103
1626551,4,B00005MKN8,"As a formula one championship review it's by far the most excelent ever done, but in my opinion, in a race there are other significant moments such a pre/post-race interviews with pilots, managers & others, funny moments and behind the scenes moments that maybe can make this feature more atractive.
Once you saw 5-6 races resume, you begin to feel that the other ones are kind of boring because they have the same camera takes, and the lenght's are almost the same too.
Either way I'm expecting the release of the 2001 championship review, thinking that perhaps the producer's maybe have been thinking about it before.
Be sure if you buy it you're going to enjoy every race because it has some details that you can't see on the TV transmission",1013731200,4,744,4.687022900763359
1626552,4,B00005MKN8,"This is the first ever DVD to capture the whole F1 Grand Prix Season.  Previous releases (from other companies) were on VHS or VCD which usually failed to bring out the thundering engine noises and the crisp images of the colourful liveries.  This DVD can do the job quite well and let you feel the atmosphere on the racetrack or inside the F1 cars.  The disk was produced in very high quality but, after seeing so many brilliant movies on DVDs with stuff like ""the making of"", ""cut footages"", ""photo galleries""...etc., I think more information or details on each race of the season could be included in this DVD.  A 4 stars DVD.",1012780800,,629,4.539823008849558
1626553,5,B00005MKN8,"Hello Amazonian...
I've been really interested about this DVD. Everybody has said that it's 4 hour video are amazing for whom love car racing.
I would like to know if this DVD has a portuguese or spanish subtitle option. Anybody could answer me. Thanks everybody. Bye...",1012089600,,270,4.891304347826087
1626554,3,B00005MKN8,"The FIA Formula One season review has been around for quite a long time and has delivered solid quality reporting as far as the highlights of the championship season go. Until the advent of digital TV (or Bernievision) in F1 and the new format of the DVD those reviews were clearly limited to what you could put on a VHS and make available basically in movie format.
The 2000 review DVD makes use of the menu and interactive capabilities by offering different angles on every race, the pitstops, the on-board cam, etc. Unfortunately there is the same (soemtimes lame) commentary associated with each angle, and each race report overall is pretty short.
There are also no additional faetures, interviews etc. that follow the major off-track developments of the season.
Overall the great advantages of more storage space and interactive cababilities of the DVD medium have not been used to their fullest",1011225600,2,901,4.973509933774834
1626555,5,B00005MKN8,"I have been a F-1 fan for years. I attended three European races in 2000 and I attended 13 races this year.  Some of the complaints of this DVD suggest there are not enough interviews, continuous track time, pre-race information, etc.  Let us be realistic.  Monaco alone goes for four days, not including press interviews, etc.  You would need 18 discs, or more, to cover all of the races.  I was in the paddock for three of these races and I still did not see the camera views and driver comments included in the DVD.  Some people will always complain (the coffee is too hot, not hot enough, on and on).  This is a great review of the F-1 2000 season and for less than the cost of three beers at Hockenheim.  If you are a fan, buy it!  I can't wait to get the 2001 season DVD.",1010620800,3,777,4.195945945945946
1626556,3,B00005MKN8,"What a wasted opportunity.  I don't know about you but I can't get enough of in-car footage.  Unfortunately you rarely get any on the live broadcasts.  This product could have provided that or at the very least should have had one full flying lap around each circuit. (Wouldn't it have been phenomenal to have been on board for each of the pole laps of the season?  Wow that would be worth owning.)  If you have ever seen Lap Of the Gods or Ayrton Senna's lap around Monte Carlo in Racing Is In My Blood, or the first 30 min of Grand Prix you will know what I am talking about.  Instead we get a few measly disjointed in-car scraps.
Ok as far as the rest of it, it does a very good job of recapping the 2000 season.  It hits a lot of highlights from each race.  The narrator does a descent job and tries to build suspense as to how each race and season is going to turn out.
As far as the menus go and the dynamic camera changes they are both executed poorly.  Everything moves to fast to be able change the camera on the fly.  I was also disappointed that there was no widescreen version.  Imagine having a picture of the track on the side showing where the cars are located while the racing is playing.  Or just anything to take advantage of  DVD and HDTV technology.  With a little creativity this could have been a product the every F1 fan simply must own, instead we get an uninspired rehash of the season.
I for one will not be getting the 2001 review and think I wasted my money on the 2000 review.  For anyone looking for some amazing F1 footage, I recommend the 3 titles listed above.  Each has its own shortcomings but there are images in each that simply cannot be seen anywhere else.",1006300800,4,1695,4.25
1626557,5,B00005MKN8,"This DVD is by far the best FIA season review ever. Never mind the other reviews listed that did not like it. They are obviously not into F1. This DVD is Bernie-vision. It has the in-car shots, pit action, and behind the scenes that the U.S. fan never sees on television. See the wing come off the back of Irvine's Jaguar, on-board with Frentzen during the wreck in Italy, Schumacher being congratulated for winning the championship by Villenue, Hakkinen, and Coulard during weigh-in after the race. I can't wait for the 2001 DVD.",1004832000,3,530,4.709677419354839
1626558,2,B00005MKN8,"I'm not a huge F1 fan but was curious about the use of multi-angle features on this disk.  Was really expecting an ""in your face"" in-car driver perspective, with extended racing sequences....disappointed with final product.  Very fragmented, difficult to follow, repetitive highlights, in-car clips too short too enjoy, pointless selectable race stats etc.  Overall, they blew it! It could have been a great DVD if they had designed it to be a seamless experience for the fan!  As it is, consider it a novelty disk, and of interest only to diehard F1 fans...If you want racing action checkout Super Speedway or Driven instead!",1004400000,,626,5.048543689320389
1626559,1,B00005MKN8,"Without a doubt, this is the worst movie in my collection.  I'm almost embarrassed to sell it to someone else!  The scene selection is confusing.  The movie covers all the races in 2000, one at a time.  it's sometimes difficult to distiguish between races.....all the same players, all the same cars.  No background stories, nothing.  The photography is ""Movies 101""..... SAVE YOUR MONEY.",1003363200,,388,5.079365079365079
7945732,3,B00005MKN8,Not very extensive covering the whole season. Could have been much better with different features and views.,1488326400,,108,5.411764705882353
7945733,5,B00005MKN8,I really liked this review as it brings back good memories of the very first time I watched a formula 1 race in Kenya.  I really wish I could obtain the official reviews for 2001 and 2002 as well.,1418688000,,196,4.0256410256410255

7945735,2,B00005MKN8,"Great RACE, but DVD sucks !! - - When you pop in the disc, you must first click the flag corresponding to the 2000 F1 race you wish to view. Then, you are directed to a menu for ""CONTINUOUS"" or ""INTERACTIVE"" viewing. ""CONTINUOUS"" plays every feature from beginning to end on that circuit, while ""INTERACTIVE"" allows you to watch any of the features at any point of the race. I usually choose ""CONTINUOUS."" At the next menu, you can choose to watch a summary of the race, a wider view from secondary cameras, an in-car camera, coverage of cars pitting during the race, or highlights of the ""onboard computer"" that shows the order of the cars during the races.

To summarize: it's a bit of a ""Pain in the Butt"" to click through all those remote control choices after the end of each of the 16 races to get to the next race. Meaning: ... you def'tly get the Hi-Lights in ""CONT MODE"" + ""SUPER-SUPER ..."" - - but it's like watching a good movie and at the end of each ""adventure"" the movie stops and you have to manually re-start it. Also, I miss the ""slow motion"" recaps of the newer F1-Disk versions.",1384560000,,1097,4.377450980392157
7945736,1,B00005MKN8,"This is the worst formatted F1 review ever. Each race is divided into 5-7 min chapters. At the conclusion of each race you're automatically sent back to the main menu, so you can't watch the entire season through, each race needs to be selected individually.

There are also subcategories for each race. One of them is OBC (On Board Camera)which features random on board footage. You wonder when watching some of the footage, why am I being shown this? Another is the PIT LANE section which amounts just seeing cars having pit stops and team managers on the wall watching their cars go by. But the most yawn inspiring is the DATA section, where you can watch the timing and scoring screen and nothing else!
Look, I have all the F1 Reviews from 1986 to 2005, and this one is the worst. Because of the poor format of the DVD, the section that matters, the one that focuses on the race, has been condensed to such a degree that you're only getting the bare essentials of each Grand Prix, who got pole, who won, and a major accident here and there. Don't waste your money like I did. Best Regards.",1336953600,,1093,4.465
7945737,3,B00005MKN8,"In addition to the 2000 review, I also have the 2004, 2005 & 2007 review DVDs. I think it's just a natural progression that they get better as time goes on. I for one didn't really like the way that this DVD was broken down into so many menu items. Too much navigating to watch it. It would have been much better to have just added the extra footage into the race video. However, having said all of that, 2000 was the year that Shumacher and Barrichelo in their Ferraris fought it out with Hakkinen and Coulthard in their McLarens. Although the race footage wasn't the highest quality, it was truly enjoyable getting to watch the season progress. If you're a true F1 fan, you'll enjoy this video. It was a great recap of an exciting year in F1.",1220227200,,744,4.359712230215828
7945738,4,B00005MKN8,"I actually got this after already owning 2004-2006 (I am still waiting for my 2003 to ship).  Ok, there are some negatives, such as the lack of continuous play of all the events (each race must be selected from the main menu, and then there is even more button-pushing before you actually get to see the review), or the relatively short running time for each event, which means fewer features that we are accustomed to.  I'd rather not get too harsh in judging this - it's an older title and I'd prefer to be glad that I can see something of what happened that year.

The good of this DVD makes it worth having, if you are an F1 fan.  To me the filming somehow makes me feel closer to the scenery, not sure why that is (different cameras, lenses maybe?).  The action is exciting, since this is some prime competition between Schumi, Hakkinen, and Coulthard, with frequent podiums from Rubens and Ralph as well. The gallic finger gesture from Coulthard in France, all the interesting interplay between Mika and Michael and the conversations with press afterward, and of course the horrific crashes in Monza, with a touching moment on the press podium with Mika, Michael, and Ralph as Michael ties Senna's win record - somehow the overall sportsmanship is more sincere and human.  (Also, I am beginning to suspect that this is the F1 technology that made it to the GT4 game.)

Basically I am so glad I bought this DVD, even though watching it requres a bit of hassle with the remote.",1185408000,,1481,4.587121212121212
7945739,4,B00005MKN8,"This was a great idea ... in theory. This DVD is packed with features like in-car camera, telemetry data, multiple camera angles, etc. Unfortunately it is a bear to navigate. All of the special features are brief and they return you to the main menu rather than the appropriate point in the race, and on a scale of 1-10, the picture quality is only a 6.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great DVD and I'm glad I bought it, I just think they could have done a better job with it. They have since given up on the additional features and subsequent annual reviews are more like traditional TV highlights.",1183420800,,596,4.36936936936937
7945740,4,B00005MKN8,"Okay, this DVD cannot allow you to view every race summary of the 2000 F1 World Championship Series continuously. It's a minor flaw, in my opinion, and it's why remote controls were invented!
The race summaries may leave you wanting, panting, even drooling for more, but to actually GET more, you'd have had to acquire a PADDOCK PASS for every F1 track on the calendar. (And, if you had that kind of access, what the heck are you doing online? Shouldn't you be in Monaco playing baccarat against James Bond?)
Yes, this DVD is far from perfect, but it is still an awesome disc for any Formula One fan, and the very minor flaws are not enough to ignore this quality product.
When you pop in the disc, you must first click the flag corresponding to the 2000 F1 race you wish to view. Then, you are directed to a menu for ""CONTINUOUS"" or ""INTERACTIVE"" viewing. ""CONTINUOUS"" plays every feature from beginning to end on that circuit, while ""INTERACTIVE"" allows you to watch any of the features at any point of the race. I usually choose ""CONTINUOUS."" At the next menu, you can choose to watch a summary of the race, a wider view from secondary cameras, an in-car camera, coverage of cars pitting during the race, or highlights of the ""onboard computer"" that shows the order of the cars during the races.
Let me tell you that I watched this DVD with great enthusiasm and satisfaction. I devoured the video highlights and the other extras, and it will take you some time to get through them all. The sounds are top notch, the picture is digital-quality, and the summaries give you a great sense of being there that many of us did not have in 2000.
Others have criticized this DVD for being what they felt it SHOULD HAVE BEEN. Unfortunately, it won't please everybody, and I'm not here to shout down the detractors. However, you are given so much quality video on this disc that criticizing it is almost ridiculous.
It's not all it could be, but it is MORE than enough to satisfy your hunger for Formula One sounds and visuals.
For quality Formula One coverage, it's the best-bet around, folks!",1036454400,10,2086,4.580213903743315
7945741,4,B00005MKN8,"I would have rated it lower actually, if it weren't for the fact that this was the very first crystal-clear footage I've ever seen. The DVD lacks in other significant coverage, and does not allow for whole continuous viewing of all 17 races. Other footages such as qualifying, candid moments and the very important pre-season review such as launches, etc. must be included. Since there is also an on board camera footage, an excellent feature would be to present a full lap of the pole position driver in that particular race. I am quite sure that this is one feature that everybody would like to see. Also, the OBC features are definitely lacking.",1019433600,3,648,4.743362831858407
