7793052,5,0835813622,"I LOVED this study!  As a pastor this is my favorite 'sermon' series I've done.  The study guide is easy to follow, the conversation is easy to keep going, and I loved the sermon starters that are provided.  Best, though, is the content.  Loved how the author put the ""I am"" sayings in context for the time in which they were said.  The 3 different study groups  really enjoyed the study as well.",1523491200,,396,4.3561643835616435
