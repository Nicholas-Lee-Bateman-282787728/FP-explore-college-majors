6361869,3,B00JJOY4FU,"Like the other reviews and comments on Equestria Daily, the main complaints have been the fact that not all the ""key"" episodes are here. Personally im just as disappointed because my favourite episodes ""Pinkie Pride"" and ""Leap of faith (two key episodes)"" aren't here and that's the reason im giving this dvd a pass and waiting for a boxset.

As for the content itself, ""Rarity takes Manehattan"" and ""It ain't easy being breezies"" as well as ""Princess Twilight's kingdom parts 1 & 2"" are key episodes (""Rainbow falls"" a key episode was released already on the dvd ""A dash of awesome""). Its the fact that the random non-key episode ""Pinkie Apple Pie"" is here... As someone who creates his own animated series, Im experienced with releasing ""themed dvds"" and having at least one episode that doesn't fit so I can probably understand what Hasbro did. 7 episodes on one disc would indeed drop the quality with compressing...

My little pony: friendship is magic is a show aimed at little girls to promote the toy line and the cover of this dvd is as girly as it can get...but parents should know just in case they don't, that in this dvd there is an epic DBZ-styled fight between two deities in the 2-parter that is definitely the highlight of getting this and worth mentioning.  Tartarus, the Hell in Greek mythology is also mentioned many times here, but still there's nothing here that's PG material.  If all the ""keys"" episodes (excluding ""Rainbow Falls"" since it was already previously released) were included in the place of ""Pinkie Apple Pie"" then this dvd would be a steal for me. Give us what we want Hasbro!! Not pink princess celestias, fake crystal ponies or boring dvds!!",1406764800,5,1680,4.762886597938144
6361870,4,B00JJOY4FU,"lets review each episode in order and give them a score out of 100

Rarity Takes Manehatten: Dave Polski is brilliant at comedy but takes a worth while risk writing a emotional story with some humour and it works relay well (69/100)

Pinkie Apple Pie: two words- wired al, oh my good this episode is so amazing greatest episode full of music and so much more as it will keep you smiling though the hole month (98/100)

It Aint East Being Breezies: a simple but yet still enjoyable episode with a good lesson but not much to say it pretty good (58/100)

(Twilight's Kingdom Part 1 and
Twilight's Kingdom Part 2): holy dam what a episode to end season 4 plus more amazing music and villain's are so amazing that its just jaw dropping (89/100)

extra; has a hole thing its wired that it misses rainbow falls but that might be for the better as it was a bad episode also there is no point jumping into mlp though this its best to start with season 2 also i suggest watch this on american netflix while waiting for a complete season 4 box-set because it will save you quit a bit of money but if you want this for love of the show then do it i won't stop you its your money",1406678400,,1167,4.2152466367713
6361871,5,B00JJOY4FU,"This is a fantastic collection of My Little Pony episodes. My Little Pony: Keys of Friendship is a collection of the best episodes from My little Pony including a sing along. And, if you are as big of a fan as I am - you will be very entertained by this collection.

This collection has more than just favorite characters - there are a lot of family matters, some good lessons, a lot of comedy and some pretty thrilling moments as well as great and catchy music.

The episodes show, as usual, the pony friends learning about friendship. However, Twilight, who recently became an alicorn (unicorn and Pegasus) doesn't feel like she is doing enough of her job as a princess. However, she will become more important than ever when an ancient beast comes back from his prison to rain chaos in Equestria! (The country where ponies live.)

I thought this was a very smart choice of episodes since the DVD contains about half of the full season. These episodes really are exciting and, even though some people may not know it, pretty funny and really show some good lessons. For example, in one episode about family, ponies argue a lot but at the end they are still just a family.

My favorite episode is when one of them learns that she is a cousin of another friend. When they realize there may be an error, they go on a road trip to find out the truth. On the way there, the family argues and feels bad that they may look like a dysfunctional family. At the end, they see that even though they argue, they are still a great family. I like it because so many families in real life feel are like that and we all need to understand that it happens with everyone - nobody is perfect.

There is nothing parents should worry about and even infants will like the bright colors of the show and its wonderful sounds. I give this DVD an age rating of 1 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars.

6361872,5,B00JJOY4FU,"Since i love Princess Twilight, i made this story about her new kingdom:

Princess Luna explains to Twilight Sparkle that they must give up their magic before Tirek comes to steal it. Twilight is more than willing to sacrifice her magic as well, but Luna elaborates that their magic can't disappear into thin air; someone has to keep it safe, and Princess Celestia says that someone is Twilight, because they believe Tirek doesn't know there's a fourth princess of Equestria.

Twilight is uncertain, as she is only just learning to control her own magic, but Princess Cadance believes she can, as she represents the element of magic itself. Celestia adds that Twilight must keep the magic a secret from her friends or else put them at great risk. With these in mind, Twilight accepts this task, and the other princesses carry out a ritual that transfers all of their magic into Twilight. Elsewhere, Discord picks up on this magical imbalance, but thinks nothing of it.
Twilight returns to the Golden Oak Library in the middle of the night, causing Spike to wake up. As a result of her absorbing the other princesses' magic, Twilight suffers from the occasional magical twitch, and she tries keeping it a secret from Spike. Spike, noting that the sun hasn't come up yet, goes back to sleep. Twilight realizes that the sun should indeed be up by now and uses her magic to (awkwardly) lower the moon and raise the sun.

Back in Canterlot, Discord and Tirek find Shining Armor, with Shining Armor labeling Discord a ""traitor"". Once Tirek absorbs his magic and that of the royal guards, Tirek tells Discord to ""go and have a little fun"" while he makes his way to the throne room. Inside, Tirek finds Celestia, Luna, and Cadance but is shocked to discover they have no magic for him to absorb.

In Ponyville, Twilight struggles to get used to her new power while also keeping them hidden from her friends. After blowing the door off the library and zooming past Rainbow Dash, she tells her friends to keep all the ponies in Ponyville indoors and heads back toward the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters.
With Celestia, Luna, and Cadance without magic for him to absorb, Tirek banishes the three princesses to Tartarus as he once was. As a sign of his gratitude and loyalty to Discord, Tirek gives him a medallion that was given to him by ""someone very close"". Tirek sees a stained glass window depicting Princess Twilight and realizes that there's a fourth princess living in Equestria. He asks Discord where she is, and Discord points him in the direction of Ponyville.

After Twilight's friends secure the other ponies' safety, Discord appears before them and imprisons them in a cage. Realizing Discord's betrayal, Fluttershy is reduced to tears. With the ponies together in one place, Tirek absorbs their magic and grows even more powerful. Discord is thrilled by the prospect of ruling Equestria alongside Tirek, but Tirek says Discord is no longer of use to him and absorbs his magic as well.
A weakened Discord reminds Tirek of his medallionhis sign of his ""gratitude and loyalty"". Tirek says the medallion was given to him by his brother Scorpan and considers both him and the medallion worthless.
Near the old castle, Twilight continues practicing her new powers, with some difficulty. When Tirek appears and demands her magic, Twilight desperately avoids him. In the process, the Golden Oak Library is completely destroyed. In a rage, Twilight fires upon Tirek with a massive magic blast. Tirek realizes what the other princesses have done, and Twilight battles him in an explosive and destructive duel.

Seeing the two of them are at a stalemate, Tirek offers with Twilight a trade: the release of her friends in exchange for the Alicorn magic. Despite her friends' protests, Twilight agrees to trade the magic for her friends, including Discord. Discord thanks Twilight and apologizes to Fluttershy, and Tirek promptly absorbs all of Twilight's magic, making him all-powerful.
Discord, repentant of his actions, gives the medallion given to him by Tirek to Twilight as a sign of true friendship. Believing this to be the final key needed to open the chest, Twilight and her friends race to the Tree of Harmony.
Twilight and friends return to the chest, where Twilight's medallion turns into the last key. Before Tirek discovers and stops them, the six friends turn the keys at the same time, and the top of the chest opens, releasing a rainbow-colored blast of power that showers them in light. The ponies are transformed and given rainbow-marked coats, manes and tails. They confront Tirek, who is unable to overpower their magic.
A blast of light strips Tirek of his power, and he is banished to Tartarus once more. Twilight and her friends fly over all of Equestria and return all of the ponies' stolen magic, and the other princesses are freed from their own imprisonment. Finally, the Tree of Harmony launches the chest and its keys toward Ponyville, where it sinks into the ground. Mere seconds later, a great castle rises out of the ground from where the chest landed.

Twilight and her friends behold the castle's majesty as their rainbow powers wear off. Princess Celestia then appears, telling Twilight that the castle is hers. As they walk through the castle corridors, Twilight finally understands her role as a princess: to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. In recognition of her role, Princess Celestia designates her the ""princess of friendship"".In the castle throne room sit seven thrones, one for Twilight and each of her friends (except for Discord, who Fluttershy tells has yet to deserve one).

As the ponies of Ponyville gather outside the new castle, Twilight steps out and invites them inside as she and her friends sing an upbeat song. Through the magic of their friendship, a rainbow shoots up from the throne room floor and travels across Equestria, where it is witnessed by Coco Pommel, the Wonderbolts, Cheese Sandwich, the Breezies (Seabreeze included), and Silver Shill. In the throne room, Discord is finally accepted by the ponies, and he gives Princess Celestia a bouquet of flowers.

The final shot of the finale sees Twilight taking a photo with her friends.",1399852800,6,6212,4.914204003813156

6361886,3,B00JJOY4FU,"Alright, what can I say, being the father of a 7 and 2 year old I've watched EVERY my little pony episode.  Love the series and I credit my children's articulate speech and friendship skills largely to this fantastic show.  Season 6 has a few winners so far that have been great episodes, but over all the season lacks the common theme or adventure in the background.  Perhaps it's because I'm an action movie loving guy, but all the fashion Rarity stuff has even my kids bored.  Whenever I see the episode takes place in Canterlot or Manehatten I'm usually ready to go do something more entertaining like wash dishes or change the oil on... well, anything.

I hope they tie it all back together and knock it out of the park at the end of the season like they do most years.  Please make a bug bear or some giant crisis level the fashion district of Manehatten.  Give us adventure, not drama, I want to teach my kids to pull through when it matters, and Rarity having a fashion crisis just teaches dramatic over reacting, something every other kids show does in abundance, and part of what drove me to My Little Ponies, the lessons here are real, and whining and drama are typically not rewarded or celebrated..",1467244800,8,1211,4.502283105022831
