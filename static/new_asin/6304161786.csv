7863734,3,6304161786,"Jeff Fahey (Darkman III, Lawn Mower Man) has been making movies since 1985. He has put time and effort in his characters, starring in 42 films since 2000. He can be a vicious gunslinger (Silverado) then turn around and be a totally polished gentelman (Outback, later released as Wrangler). This ability to put himself in his character's skin makes him an interesting study. That's why he works so well in ""Virtual Seduction"".  He portrays a ruderless man lost in fantasy. He's fueled by love, regrets and heartbreak over the death of his lover. But living in fantasy has it's price. Though not a big-budget film, it's entertaining and Fahey makes us empathize with his character's need to have another chance. Worth a look both to see this actor's skills and view a good sci-fi thriller.",1017273600,7,787,4.82962962962963
