8618397,5,B00FRTTSYI,"A very fun drama well worth watching if you are into comedy. Compared to more western comedies it can sometimes appear more exaggerated but it never goes overboard and gets annoying in my opinion. The actors are good, I don't really know most of them except Akanishi Jin and Taguchi Junnosuke both from other dramas and from KAT-TUN but I think everyone did a good job and worked well together. Each episode works on its own and there isn't exactly a fixed storyline connecting everything but the episodes help show off the characters and their growth and somethings do tie togther in the end. It's a shame there is only 10 episodes but it seems to be a thing with many japanese dramas. On the plus side the theme song Keep the Faith is amazingly good and gets addicting fast, while I found this drama through KAT-TUN but don't hesitate to check the group out if you found this drama first.",1416441600,,890,4.53416149068323
