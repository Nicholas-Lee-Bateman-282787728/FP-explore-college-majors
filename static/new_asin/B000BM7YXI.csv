2423646,4,B000BM7YXI,"This is Gatton live, telling it like it is... for him.  The guy has so much in his head he just assumes we all have it, too.  It's enjoyable and fun.  Yes, you can learn from it, too.  But beware, he's out there and some of his stuff is hard to digest the first go 'round.  But watch it a lot and learn how a true master of the art pulls musical rabbits out of his hat with no mirrors.  It's the real deal.",1168473600,3,406,3.7738095238095237
2423647,1,B000BM7YXI,"The tiltle threw me off since i did not know who Danny Gatton was. I was expecting to learn some amazing rhythm patterns and great strummings techniques because of all the other reviews that I have read ,but all I saw was the same pluck and pick patterns and different jazz chords (some blues chords as well).I guess You have to be a fan of Mr. Gatton to enjoy the material. I know I did not enjoy it at all or really learned anything(I could not bare to sit through the whole thing but I forced myself).The only part I enjoyed was about one minute worth, when Mr. Gatton had the acoustic guitar(he used an electric guitar throughout the dvd)and used a really cool rhythm.",1146528000,7,672,4.384
2423648,5,B000BM7YXI,"I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to write this one for the following reasons:

Being a novice guitarist, my first impression of this DVD was that I was in way over my head. But after closely watching some of the easier segments(and studying the enclosed book), I began to pick up on the material. I could not help but feel privileged when listening to Gatton both discuss and demostrate. This guy is a monster! He even discusses a type of playing his father(guitarist back in the 30's) shared with him when he was a child. To me, this DVD is worth more than what it sells for....it's a steal. Gatton does not pussyfoot around, so make sure you bring your A game. If you like the Telecaster sound you will absolutely be thrilled. This one's a keeper...Thank you Danny!",1145145600,21,791,4.531468531468532
2423649,5,B000BM7YXI,"What can I say...""The Humbler""..kinda says it all...just watch him play.

Looks easy ya say??

I've been playing now for 30 years...still wish I could play like that!!

Very ""down to Earth"" video reveals quite alot of ideas and licks...

  ......Have fun",1138752000,11,254,4.928571428571429
2423650,5,B000BM7YXI,"Anyone who is interested in learning the correct way to play rhythm guitar should look no further. The late great Danny Gatton was far above the musical plane that most mortals ever aspire, and here you can learn how to follow.

His lessons are as fine as crystal--very rarely does he loose the train except to make a cool point--and he has obviously thought them out well in advance as he did with everything that surrounded his playing. Danny uses his fantastic rhythm section consisting of an amazing drummer and a doghouse bass player that burns down the house while simultaneously helping Danny to get his points across. And if this isn't enough, Arlen Roth--another smoker--gets up and plays lead. He even has his guitar tech join in at the end of the DVD and trade leads with Arlen while Danny holds down the rhythm chores as steady as a sea anchor holds a boat during a storm. Pay close attention all you shredders who believe playing rhythm is passe, you may find yourself taking that long overdue lesson in rhythm playing.

The DVD format itself is well organized and the learner can take the lessons one episode at a time at both normal speed as well as at a snails pace. The instructional manual is also well anotated and helpfull.

If you want to learn how to play rhythm like a master do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. Spend the time letting this warm, humble, and funny man show you the way to play magnificent rhythm guitar. There aren't many that can play like Danny these days and sadly he is gone forever. Fortunately for us mortals, we have a few rare gems like this DVD to remember him by. This is one of the few instructional tools that doesn't treat the artist as a star rather it shows him surrounded by and working with other artists to create real music.

Buy this DVD and his telemaster DVD--Danny's intro capella is worth the price of admission alone. Then buy his 88 Elmira Street, Redneck Jazz, and Cruisin Deuces CD's. After living with and assimilating Danny's take on playing into your own style you may discover that you have a fresh and clearer perspective on playing our beloved instrument not to mention a fondness for one of the guitar's greatest players. This guy was THE REAL DEAL!

If you trust my opinion and work hard, and I am not mistakenly speaking out of my respect and fondness for one of history's greatest players and one of my greatest mentors, in a few short years the people in the audience will begin to ask how you learned to play such fantastic and magical rhythm guitar.

We, your dedicated students, miss you dearly Danny",1135728000,48,2583,4.556034482758621
2423651,5,B000BM7YXI,Danny Gatton was The Man. Learned a lot and got a lot to work on for the remaining years of my life...Ha.,1356220800,,105,3.8181818181818183
2423652,5,B000BM7YXI,"These dvds are a must own ,i purchased both tele master and strictly rhythm..not everything you see is transcribed mainly the longer jams but dannys hands are always the focus so you can figure it out. So happy i got these!!!!",1334793600,,226,4.536585365853658
2423653,2,B000BM7YXI,"This DVD is for advanced players only!!! Unless you have mastered chord theory, and music theory, or you have a natural ear for pitch you will be in way over your head. It is not really instructional but more of a demonstration. Like many of the ""hot licks"" dvd's its not really structured learning, more of a musician demonstrating some licks. But Gatten moves too fast and is very disorganized. I would not buy this DVD again and wish I had my money back. I would learn about as much just having a DVD of him performing in concert.

The best ""Hot Licks"" DVD's I have seen of yet are Warren Haynes Blues and Slide guitar and Ronnie Earl DVD.",1267056000,12,642,4.35
2423654,5,B000BM7YXI,This is a great DVD for anyone interested in guitar or just listening  to one of the most talented guitar players in the world. I greatly enjoyed it and I'm sure most people will too. Well worth the money. I miss him.,1248480000,,217,4.166666666666667
2423655,4,B000BM7YXI,"There are a couple of things you should be aware of about Danny Gatton and this DVD/booklet: Danny Gatton was, of course, an amazing guitarist, but NOT a very good teacher, and he freely admits on both of his instructional DVDs that he knows WHAT to do and HOW to do it but he can't really EXPLAIN it, so it is incumbent upon the student to approach these lessons thoughtfully and analytically in order to get the most out of them. Having some knowledge of music theory (of which Gatton claimed he was totally ignorant) will help tremendously. For example, the very first lesson on this DVD (""two-note wonder"" chords) is an absolute treasure-trove of musical information (in spite of its simplicity) IF you take the time to study it to find out why these chords work the way they do (and if you do so, you will not only learn a lot about comping, but you'll also realize how to incorporate this concept into your lead playing, commonly known as ""double-stop"" playing). In other words, instead of seeing these lessons as ends in-and-of-themselves, try to look for the underlying concepts involved, and you'll get a lot more out of this DVD. A careful study of the accompanying text helps a lot. In fact, there may be some value in studying the text first, and then watching Gatton demonstrate the technique. At any rate, a word of warning: the accompanying booklet transcribes these lessons in both standard musical notation as well as tablature; the standard notation appears to be correct throughout, but I found a number of errors in the tablature. Any guitarist who can only read tab is going to get seriously messed up and wonder why the hell things don't sound right. The publisher has done a disservice to the student by not proofreading more carefully.",1232236800,17,1759,4.714285714285714
2423656,4,B000BM7YXI,"... of what Gatton presents here, your game will advance tremendously. Definitely for advanced guitarists, there's enough deep content here to spend a few years polishing. One caveat: it's almost all oriented towards blues substitutions so if you're not interested in that aspect of guitar-playing you may be disappointed.",1208649600,2,322,5.591836734693878
2423657,3,B000BM7YXI,"Danny Gatton is an amazing guitarist...this is for sure. However, this video is strictly for advanced players. Just learning to fret 10% of the chords he uses would take me (an intermediate guitar player) months of practice. Even HE doesn't know the names of some of the chords! Also, as another reviewer noted, it's next to impossible to see where he's got his fingers sometimes because of the glare. It's fun to watch though!",1200700800,6,427,4.783783783783784
2423658,4,B000BM7YXI,"Gatton was a great player, and seeing this dvd shows how much a skilled player can do with a simple no frills guitar - he plays a Tele and gets sounds out of it like a Hammond B-3 organ, and shows power chords that he was apparently playing before Pete Townsend picked up a guitar.  Also plays rhythms and melodies at the same time.  When he has another player doing lead on his Tele, they are phenomenal. My only hesitation in recommending this is that there's not a lot of tab, and the camera doesn't focus closely enough  on his fingers at times, so it's a little hard for me in several places. On the other hand, his lesson on Chuck Berry riffs is worth the purchase. Of all the guitar dvd's I've  bought so far, I like Kenny Sultan and Ernie Hawkins the best.  Hawkins has actual film of Lightnin' Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb, then Ernie shows it step by step, and he's a very effective teacher.  I just ordered Warren Haynes and James Burton's dvd's, so don't know yet how they'll stack up.",1195084800,,995,4.351351351351352
2423659,2,B000BM7YXI,There is some incredible guitar playing going on on this DVD. As an intermediate player (about 8 years now) the instruction was not something I could follow and apply.,1193443200,5,167,4.793103448275862
2423660,5,B000BM7YXI,"This DVD is inspiring as well as being fun , which is a hard combination to find .

I love rhythm guitar and pay close attention to it , but I need to work on it a lot more , hence buying this DVD . I like to see whether a band's guitarist can play rhythm in a tasteful way and if not , that tells me that they may not value it .

Danny clearly does (or did) .
As another reviewer put it , Danny shows how to work with other musicians and that is one of the most important things for me to see as I value it very highly - let's face it , it helps you to get work .

A number of styles are shown - basically , it is a great lesson from a player who transcends 'ability' and is in a whole other realm .

Very highly recommended .",1184198400,3,727,3.611464968152866

8088757,3,B000BM7YXI,"I had hopes that this was going to be better content.  It isn't taught or tabbed exceptionally well -- not particulalry a problem but could be better.  Many of the demonstrated rhythms are not ones I am likely to use,",1411862400,,217,4.4
8088758,5,B000BM7YXI,This is a very good dvd with must know rhythm patterns useful for any guitarist...the tab print in book is a bit to small for my eyes but i mainly watch listen and try to learn...lol...but i really love this dvd,1385251200,,211,4.170731707317073
8088759,4,B000BM7YXI,"Yikes! They didn't call him ""The Humbler"" for nothing. This video is not for the faint of heart, but it's even better than similar videos by Robben Ford (believe itor not) or Ronniue Earl. Danny Gatton may not have been the most patient or gifted instructor around, but he had chops like probably no one else you've ever seen--and he explains them to you.",1384300800,,355,4.5625
8088760,5,B000BM7YXI,"He's one of the masters of music, using the guitar.
It just goes to show you there's no need to read music, music schools or american idol, to be a great musician.
If you're feeling the need to be a better musician, using the guitar, and its so bad to the point of feeling sick,
GET THIS DVD. It has wisdom for all levels of players. and I promise you, it will last throughout your growth as a musician.
He's a down to earth guy, somewhat of a comedian. He admits to not knowing what you call a lot of things he does but he knows what they sound like,
what they look like, where they work and most of all how to teach. You'll accelerate your performance by leeps and bounds with this stuff. I emphasize (Performance) and not just head knowledge.",1362441600,,745,4.216783216783217
