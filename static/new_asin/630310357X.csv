Still not received a credit-nothing-will not order from this supplier in the future.

7838700,5,630310357X,I am a 54 year old beginner. I read The Little Red Book but I learn more easily from visual demonstrations. This video is easy to follow and has given me a whole winter's worth of things to work on. I don't need a bunch of theory just some simple drills to help me. This video is great for the basics.,1228521600,,301,3.9508196721311477
7838701,5,630310357X,"The Little Red Book is one of the greatest golf instructional books of all time, and I would argue the greatest.  It's simple golf, it teaches the game and the swing without the technical jargin that too many people get caught up in.  The only flaw with the book is its lack of illustration, though must concepts are simple enough not to need them.
The Little Red Video offers images of those concepts.  It's one thing to talk about ""clipping the tee"" and another to see Ben Crenshaw make a smooth swing with that thought.  There is a saying in art, ""The great artist is the simplifier,"" well, I think that goes in golf, too.  I strongly reccomend this book to anyone who loves golf--it's forever changed my game and my outlook.",1054598400,7,728,4.484848484848484
7838702,3,630310357X,"This is an excellent video if the viewer can stand 15 minutes of back-patting. The step by step instructions and imagery make this a great instructional video. Sure wish they did some video magic to Harvey, the  camera doesn't do his antiquity justice.",933033600,2,252,4.8604651162790695
7838703,4,630310357X,"This video features Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, two of Harvey's pupils.  Their admiration for 'their pro' shows. The video examines a wide range of shots, handles the mental game well and reiterates -shotmaking is the name  of the game- not form.",929318400,9,245,4.809523809523809
