5787921,5,B00DBVHHDS,the grand kids LOVE it.. watch it all the time over and over again and it's not even Halloween yet :),1379980800,2,101,3.857142857142857
5787922,4,B00DBVHHDS,"Although our family is new to Curious George (the animated version, at least), this Halloween-themed adventure was a pleasant surprise.  Our daughter is three and that seems to be a pretty good starting age for lightweight Halloween fare like this: it's just a little bit spooky, but it won't scar her for life.  The story of ""No Noggin"" is cute, the songs are reasonably catchy and the animation is crisp, smooth and colorful.

Sure, parents might prefer their childhood favorites like ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure"" or ""The Great Pumpkin"", but this charming little tale is fun for kids and won't irritate parents in the process.  My daughter's watched this at least half a dozen times during the last two weeks and, as far as I'm concerned, she can keep watching it until Thanksgiving.

The DVD is decent enough, serving up a strong anamorphic widescreen transfer and good audio but nothing in the way of extras.  Luckily, this is a low-priced DVD, so the light about of content (less than an hour) won't feel like a ripoff.  Whether you're new to modern-day Curious George (like I was) or have enjoyed his other animated adventures, you and your kids will probably enjoy this one!",1379980800,,1185,4.865671641791045
5787923,5,B00DBVHHDS,My 4 year old and one and a half year old can't get enough Curious George and this movie was wonderful! We have The Christmas Curious George and Swings into Spring also and each movie is just as sweet and captivating as the next.,1379808000,,229,4.2272727272727275
5787924,5,B00DBVHHDS,"I am a big fan of Curious George, and I collect all the DVDs, this one I totally recommended! It is definately better than the 'Swing into Spring' one.
This DVD is so cute, it have 3 cute songs, and it so funny especially the last 7 minutes, LOL! I can't stop laughing, it so funny, cute and entertain. Buy it, I am sure your kids would love it, this is a great Halloween DVD that you can play on your TV on Halloween day with your childrens and grandchildrens.",1379203200,,461,4.133333333333334
5787925,4,B00DBVHHDS,Songs aren't as 'catchy' as previous specials but the story is fun and it got a few chuckles out of my 3 year old.,1379203200,,114,3.7916666666666665
5787926,5,B00DBVHHDS,"We received this movie yesterday and my son has probably watched this movie 10 times since then! He tells everyone he sees about ""No Noggin"".

Note: this is a movie not a collection of tv episodes like the other Curious George DVD's. It runs about an hour and has 3 songs that can get stuck in your head but we loved trying to sing along!

Would recommend for any George fan!",1378512000,14,375,4.267605633802817
5787927,5,B00DBVHHDS,"My family and I are huge Curious George fans and were very excited to see a Halloween film done in similar fashion to the Christmas Monkey and Swings in the Spring movies. My daughters (6yr, 4rs) loved this movie and neither of them were scared at all. The songs aren't as great as the Christmas Monkey movie, but they were still decent considering how hard it is to write a good Halloween song that's age appropriate. The plot was engaging enough for both my kids, but I could tell my 4 year old was getting a little bored in the middle of the movie when they are building the plot more.  The last 15 minutes had them on the floor laughing and I will admit I had a great time too. It was done in a similar fashion to the shows on PBS and had all the same voice actors.

This movie is a welcomed addition to the Halloween movie collection that I can enjoy with my entire family.

Update: 01-06-2015.....
This is now a favorite of our 2 yr old. She would watch it everyday if we let her and I have to say that the songs have really grown on me. Solid family friendly movie.",1378166400,24,1072,4.169082125603865

5787929,5,B00DBVHHDS,This Curious George movie was extremely well done! Very catchy and memorable songs that children will love!

5787960,3,B00DBVHHDS,Looking at the SD version I can't possibly imagine what the difference would be in the HD version. Can there really be HD cartoons with this style of animation? Interesting that they would try to get 3 more dollars out of people for basically no difference.,1509321600,,257,4.608695652173913
5787961,4,B00DBVHHDS,"I purchased this for son and I to watch because he was really interested in watching Curious George that week, and we saw part of this movie several times on the PBS Kids app. I kind of wanted to see how the whole thing went and I thought it would be better to see the whole movie instead of just a part of it. My son is two (almost three) and has watched it a couple of times. He seems to like it, it holds his attention for periods. The story is not bad if you follow it. It is basically about ghost called ""No-noggin"" that steals peoples' hats every Halloween. There are some interesting plot twists, and it is an original Halloween ghost story. I think Curious George is a good way to introduce young children to Halloween. The only reason I give it four stars is I found the direction to be a bit hectic and nervous, as if they were trying to fit in lots and lots of dialogue and multiple storylines in what is basically a 40 minute short about a monkey. Next time, keep it simple guys, think family trip to a farm slow, and I think your audience would appreciate it.  After watching it 2 or three times, I would say that it is a lot of fun and deserves repeat watchings. Perhaps it will become a part of your family's Halloween traditions in the years to come, as I suspect it will in mine!",1509235200,,1296,4.163346613545817

For example, they play a game where they hide and then jump out and say ""boo"". Each time, you see George be surprised -  a little scared - and then laugh at the game. This is entertainment as it should be for young kids. Nothing gory or scary. Everyone is friends and helps one another. No parents are killed off for dramatic effect. In fact, George has a healthy, close relationship with the Man in the Yellow Hat. I would promote this one to ""holiday classic"" status.

The only downside, is that I had to yell at my kids a few times for trying to kick hats like no noggin.  Not the greatest thing for a story to involve kicking heads, but we quickly got past that phase, and it's fun to see how much the kids love the movie.",1462233600,,496,4.189473684210526

Everything about this movie is adorable.  I asked my husband the other night, Is it weird that I want to live in this town?  It's just an ideal little setting and everyone is nice to each other and even No Noggin isn't scary to my son, who doesn't like suspense and I wouldn't even want to expose him to scary surprises at this age, with his disposition.  He tends to like the 12 minute Curious George episodes on PBS and these holiday movies.  The ones he does NOT like at all are the Curious George 1 and 2 movies.  We've decided that those are more about the man with the yellow hat than about George trying to figure things out.  We prefer the ones that are more about George, which is absolutely this movie.",1430784000,2,973,4.1436170212765955

I can put these on and not have to worry about my kids coming back and asking me some unpleasant question about something someone said in the series.

I had a few laughs as well, mostly because my 3-year-old daughter thought it was hilarious. She watched this several times leading up to Halloween and found it just as funny every time. In true Curious George fashion, there are also some sweet moments and lessons learned in this cute film.

This movie has caused sleepless nights and lots of inconvenience; I now have to accompany my kid to the bathroom, when she used to go by herself with no issue.

5788197,5,B00DBVHHDS,"This movie is set in the country with George and all his friends, including Bill, Allie, the Renkins, the Quints, Jumpy Squirrel, and Bill's bunnies. It's a sweet, charming (not scary) story. It's a lot of fun for the kids and grown-ups in our house. We've watched it, gosh, I have lost count of how many times.

My 3 year old thinks it's hilarious and my 1 year old loves to pull her shirt up over her head and imitate ""No Noggin,"" a legendary scarecrow who is rumored to return every year to kick the hats off of trick-or-treaters.

The moral of the story is to be brave, even when you're scared. My son quotes the Man in the Yellow Hat saying ""You scare me No Noggin, but that won't stop me!"" But, his favorite part is the ""Boo"" song. In fact, this movie has a few songs and they are catchy, memorable, and enhance the story.

I highly recommend this and also ""A Very Monkey Christmas,"" which I think I love more than my kids do. So grateful for this good clean entertainment to share with my kids.",1382227200,,1001,4.285714285714286
