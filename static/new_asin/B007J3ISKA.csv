5090483,4,B007J3ISKA,"I first saw this movie on cable, just because it was set in one of those huge retirement ""villages"" you find all over Arizona. But because it was about a porn star who runs home to his parents to get out of the business, I was afraid  it was just going to be another cheesy B-movie. But I was pleasantly surprised, I must say. It still has that B-movie feel, like the porn films the protagonist once made, but the story goes places you don't expect, and has a genuine charm and warmth. And a pretty uplifting message about growing older but not necessarily slower--sexually and otherwise. I truly enjoyed the lead character's journey, and how moving there helped him change his life and the lives of many of the elders he met.

You'll also be pleasantly surprised by some of the cast members, who you'll recognize from TV shows and films you've seen before. So don't let the summary scare you away. It's a really sweet little film--not necessarily for the entire family, but there's no real sexy stuff involved.",1448064000,3,1011,4.580110497237569

5090485,5,B007J3ISKA,"TO A SENIOR, ENJOYING A STRESS-FREE LIFE, HAVING THE KIDS COME BACK HOME TO STAY IS A NIGHTMARE.  THIS FILM PUT A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT ADULT CHILDREN CAN TEACH THEIR PARENTS ABOUT LIVING AND LOVING.  THE BEGINING IS  LIGHT PORN, BUT ONCE YOU GET PASSED IT,  IT'S ALL FUN!",1411948800,,280,4.431372549019608
5090486,5,B007J3ISKA,"This movie was not to my knowledge well advertised and I only found out about it, because my brother put it on one night. It was laugh out loud hysterical in many spots, had a touching story line and of course, a happy ending.
Corbin is a jaded porn star who has a complete breakdown and a crisis over his life and career choices. His parents come to rescue him from a psyche facility and take him home to their retirement community in Arizona.
You recognize many of the actors, although no one is well known, but the performances are excellent. This movie is definitely a diamond in the rough and I guarantee you will laugh out loud several times.",1400457600,4,648,4.408333333333333
5090487,5,B007J3ISKA,Despite how the blurb might read this is actually a quirky rom com with a side story in a retirement community. Not unpredictable but really quite charming.,1393632000,,156,4.814814814814815
5090488,5,B007J3ISKA,"Funny movie, it is rare to find such fun in a non mainstream movie. Totally worth it. I bought additional copy for my parents.",1392681600,2,126,4.291666666666667
5090489,4,B007J3ISKA,Especially fun for seniors living in a retirement community.  A lot of good laughs.  I'm showing it to a group at my retirement community.,1392508800,,138,4.708333333333333
5090490,1,B007J3ISKA,"Valley of the Sun is extremely predictable, full of annoying horny-old-woman stereotypes that were boring 30 years ago on Golden Girls and are even more boring today; of mean, arrogant bullies vs decent folk; and just about every other tired clich from every hackneyed TV drama and sitcom of the last 40 years.

Johnny Whitworth plays a thirtysomething LA porn star who for some unexplained reason goes nuts and then moves in with his parents in Arizona. He's shirtless and sweaty practically everywhere he goes in the old people's community where his parents live, and then he rolls his eyes and acts astonished when the old folks of both sexes and a neurotic young woman in a pharmacy paw at him. What a jerk, and what a stupid, annoying movie.

I don't know what planet the reviewers who praised it came from, but it's not one I want to visit. Beth Grant is fantastic, though, as she is in every single movie and television show she's ever appeared in. If this dumb, profoundly irritating movie is worth watching at all, it's for her and her only.",1361059200,,1050,4.639784946236559
8518167,5,B007J3ISKA,Looking for the edgier version of Little Miss Sunshine.  Look no further!  This movie is hilarious and touching and (somehow) incredibly relevant today.  Two thumbs (and two cacti) up.,1508198400,,184,5.275862068965517
8518168,2,B007J3ISKA,I once popped a pimple on my wife's back that was more dramatic and had more gravitas then this ridiculousness.,1506729600,,111,4.6
8518169,4,B007J3ISKA,"Loved the movie. Wish the first few minutes weren't there. Didn't need to see the adult toys and body gestures. But afterwards, a great funny romantic comedy, Glad to see a lot of actors from other movies and TV.",1495324800,,212,4.461538461538462

8518175,3,B007J3ISKA,"Is there such thing as a living a clean life after years of porn?  I thought I would watch 5 minutes of this movie and move on, but this was somewhat engaging.  This movie shows a humorous perspective of one man's journey back home to a cleaner life.  Some sweet moments, some too hokey for me.",1474243200,,294,4.214285714285714
