4711558,5,B005J4X91E,"This documentary is an absolute must-have for any Mott the Hoople fan, or any fan of hard, driving, intelligent rock and roll. Mott were one of the great r 'n r bands of the 1970s, amazing on LP (yeah, remember those?) but simply astounding live. I saw them three times, and can honestly say those were three of the best concerts I ever attended. ""Ballad"" is an extensive overview of the band's beginnings in the 1960s, a recounting of the personnel changes, interviews, photos, and an elegiac tribute to their inevitable end. But the high point, for me, was the inclusion of concert footage, which shows Mott in all their power and majesty. To once again see Ian Hunter, inscrutable behind those ever-present shades, his hair flying as he howled out their signature anthems, Overend Watts towering over everyone in his 8-inch thigh-high boots and silver-sprayed hair (Mott flirted successfully with a glam look for a while) as he hammered out heavy bass lines, and the changing guitar line-up of Mick Ralphs, Luther Grosvener and finally Mick Ronson layering soaring runs and chords into the mix will get any fan's heart racing and blood pumping. It's impossible to sit still while you watch those scenes, and they bring back the hard rock music scene of the 1970s with stunning precision.

The interviews really delve into the various personalities of the band members; sadly, Overend chose not to participate, and his voice is definitely missed, but Ian Hunter provides a wonderful, thoughtful, and at times laugh-out-loud take on the proceedings. Comments from the famed rock photographer Leee Black Childers show just how important Mott were to their audiences, and the final shot of him with tears in his eyes as he recalls the impact of the band sundering is really a heartbreaker.

Seriously, if you were one of those people who sang along every time ""All the Young Dudes"" came on the radio, if you ever owned a Mott album, if you were or are a fan of colossal 70's rock, this DVD is a must-have. I know I will watch it on a regular basis, both for the memories and the music. Five-star, and thanks to Chris Hall and Mike Kerry for taking me back to such a wonderful time in my teen years.",1318377600,61,2197,4.71875
4711559,5,B005J4X91E,"This is just a great DVD for Mott fans. The interviews are full of interesting stories. The concert clips are what I really wanted to see and unfortunately most of them are not complete. Full length versions of some of the old concert clips would have made this really incredible, but it's still a very well made very entertaining documentary of the band. The bonus stuff, which does have some complete clips from their recent reunion concert is quite excellent. The production, sound quality, and packaging is all first class Hollywood quality and very worthy of a legend. Long live Mott The Hoople! Highly recommended for Mott fans!",1338508800,3,634,4.87962962962963
4711560,4,B005J4X91E,"Mott's somewhat rough-hewn brand of rock caught my ear right away in a very pure sort of way, that is, hearing Dudes and later One of the Boys and having to find out who the artist was; I became a fan instantly.  Mott was a very intense, emotional band. Everything was a big deal. As the raving classic leadoff track from Mott, All the Way From Memphis, and the heartbreaking Wish I Was Your Mother remind us they were one of the best bands of the early 70's. As Mott's fan club president so eloquently put it, ""few bands captured your imagination and made you care the way they did"". And as I put it, this is great rock & roll, overflowing with heart, and a great tribute.",1336003200,,673,4.2578125
4711561,5,B005J4X91E,A very well done informative piece of history. Very unfortunate so little video of Mott in all their glory exists. Would be great if all the TV shows they were on could be collected and released. These guys are not getting any younger. It is a shame no Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame enshrinement. Makes the hall a joke.,1335225600,2,316,4.283333333333333
4711562,5,B005J4X91E,For any rock historian - for any rock fan - this is a must! They were like no other and this story captures that feeling better than any other rock documentary that I've seen.  A sure must have!!!,1330128000,,196,4.157894736842105
4711563,2,B005J4X91E,DVD RAMBLES ON AND ON TRYING TO BE A GOOD DOCUMENTARY ON MOTT BUT IT ENDS UP AS ONE BIG BORE AND NO MUSIC SANS A FEW SECOND CLIP FROM TIME TO TIME.  IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO SEE AND HEAR SOME MOTT IN ACTION THIS DVD IS NOT THE AVENUE FOR YOU.  THE HISTORY IS OK BUT DO WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT OUR ROCK BANDS.  IT'S JUST ROCK AND ROLL BUT IN THIS CASE MUSIC IS NOT ON TAP..,1329782400,6,383,3.5903614457831323
4711564,5,B005J4X91E,"So cool to have this at last.....i went to one of the reunion shows in London in 2009, and as an American it was something to see how many old UK fans were still connected to these men in their sixties-and Ian Hunter at 70! I was even standing next to Oasis'  Noel Gallagher! I kinda wish there was something about the Mott lineup and 2 lp's post Hunter, but this is well worth the money......bonus material like the reunion footage is great and the Pretenders' Martin Chambers drummed perfectly in place of the ailing Buffin, and Martin has his own Mott connections in his past too... BUY THIS!!!",1327190400,3,597,4.477064220183486
4711565,5,B005J4X91E,"Mott the Hoople mostly known for all the young dudes [not best song]
just made enough noize to become the greatest cult rock band of all
time! Ian Hunter went on to become one of the greatest songwriters
of all time! Many bands like Ramones, KISS, Slade and all the glam
rockers of the 80's not only stole their image but raw music power!
This dvd is a great rock n roll story for any rock n roller but also
for Mott fans! I first heard them when I was 9 and my brother was
going see them at the Warehouse in New Orleans! I wanted to go so
bad! I never got to see them! that was way back before kids went
to rock concerts, mtv, internet etc....anyway BUY IT NOW! but my
only complaint is where is the bonus footage of Midnight Special,
DKR concert and other tv aappearances? I have bootlegged videos
and dvd's but it's not full shows and quality! come on! MOTT fans
deserve whatever is out there. I hope something is released by
whoever owns the rights but I will continue my search! Oh if you
want the full show of the reunion tour go to maxiumnsound.com!
they have a great fan shot version! it's awesome!",1326758400,3,1106,4.221698113207547
4711566,5,B005J4X91E,I am such a HUGE Mott The Hoople fan! This DVD was fantastic and gave an inside look at the band. I would recommend to any one who LOVES Mott The Hoople.,1325980800,2,153,3.8125
4711567,4,B005J4X91E,"Mott the Hoople were a vastly under-rated rock band, lumped in with lighter-weight ""glam"" groups like Sweet and Slade by rock journos of the time. Heavily influenced by Blonde on Blonde-period Dylan and the Stones, Mott was a wonderful classic rock band, both live and in the studio. This DVD tells a candid history of the band and of the times ('69-'75). The tour of Mott London is enjoyable, and the performances from their recent one-off reunion are welcome. Fans of the band will be delighted, and younger rock connosieurs have a chance to be turned onto a great group.",1324598400,4,573,4.74
4711568,5,B005J4X91E,"Mott The Hoople DID ""rule.""  Shame we ""Yanks"" weren't hip enough to catch on to them till after Mick Ralphs, more or less, ""caught our attention"" in Bad Company (who, in all honesty, DID do ""Ready For Love"" a lot better).  But then, ""The Golden Age Of Rock And Roll"" finally caught our collective ears, and I still think Ariel Bender AKA Luther Grosvenor will go to Rick and Roll Heaven for the guitar solo on that song.  Then ""Mott Live,"" and then...* 12/74...that was IT - and they'd even been able to snare the immortal Mick Ronson for at least ONE single.  Well, one is better than nothing.  I have a boot of the ""Reunion Concert"" of 11/10, and a another boot of their various performances on ""Midnite Special""  and that silliness (Buffin with those log-sized drum sticks...I hope that shows up here on ""Ballad"") - well, better late than never, and I'm as excited about this (it having received the blessing of Mick Ronson's family), as I was the...""legitimate"" presentation of ""Ladies & Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones."" 1/6/12 - I received the DVD for a holiday gift - it's worth 5 stars and more.  And as a bass player myself, I was most gratified that Overend ""Pete"" Watts was only peripheraly mentioned...""glam???"" Gimme a break.  And the ""Midnite Special"" foolishness with Buffin weilding those combative-ninja drumsticks IS here too, BTW.  Thanks for getting back together one more time, Mott The Hoople: the world needs you now more than ever.",1320019200,20,1453,4.756972111553785

Makes me appreciate them even more........",1397779200,,156,6.136363636363637
8475447,3,B005J4X91E,"I give the actual video content a 4, maybe 4-1/2 stars, but the product itself gets no more than a 2.  I really like Mott, going back to the late 60's/early 70's when my older brother turned me on to them (pre-Dudes).  The video does a good job with their story and covers the early days through the reunion; but, at least on the copy I received, the disc has no chapter marks so unless you choose to watch the whole thing in one sitting, be prepared to have to fast-forward to where you left off.  If you want to revisit a section, again, be prepared to rewind or fast-forward to find that section.  Some people may feel that the video quality isn't up to modern standards, and of course it's not, given that a lot of it was shot in the late 60's and the 70's - to me, this should/does not figure into the rating any more than anitquated special effects would affect the rating of a 1940's Sci-Fi movie.
All in all, it was an enjoyable and informative video, and I'm pretty sure that my brothers will also enjoy watching it.  However, whoever put this disc together is either extremely lacking in their knowledge of how to properly format a disc (e.g., chapter marks) or is a really ""sick puppy"" who did it willfully for a laugh.",1368403200,3,1230,4.3304347826086955
8475448,3,B005J4X91E,"Even a die-hard Mott The Hoople fan will be disappointed with this lengthy, drag on and on remembrance dvd.  They could have at least shown full length live/concert footage between each lengthy commentary to break up the yawn evoking trance you will lull into from watching this.  I was very excited about this dvd until I watched it.  I wanted/hoped to like it, but I can't say that happened.  I gave it an ""okay"" rating because I'm such a huge Mott fan and couldn't give it ""don't like"" rating.  I can't ever say I don't like anything ""Mott The Hoople"".",1365638400,6,555,4.51
