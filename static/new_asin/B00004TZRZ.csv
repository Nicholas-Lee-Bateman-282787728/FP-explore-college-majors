1353238,5,B00004TZRZ,"I love this movie so much I have forced everyone I know to watch it.  All of them loved it too.  My college roommates were all able to do the ""Varsity  Drag""(the show-stopping dancing finale) by the time  they moved out!  It's a musical set in the 1920's on a college campus.  While it ends in your typical guy-gets-girl fashion, it takes you on a  thrilling ride along the way.  Tommy, the captian of the Tait football team  needs help from the independent, talented, and of course beautiful student  librarian, so that he can pass his French class and win the big game.",947635200,7,571,4.456310679611651
1353239,5,B00004TZRZ,"I am so in love with this movie.  I know every word to the French Lesson song, I know every step to the Varsity Drag,  I know every whistle in Lucky in Love, and just when my tape broke, it went out of print.  Woe is me!  Seriously though, this was a wonderful musical, it even surpassed Singin'  In The Rain as my favorite.  It is filled with dancing fun and lots of good  times.  It is extremely clever with scads of interrelated stories and  plots.  Whoever didn't love this just didn't watch it.  A must see and  worth any price.",946166400,6,533,4.1683168316831685
1353240,5,B00004TZRZ,"Another nifty 40's minor musical that may not be one of MGM's most famous outings but is right up there with the best of them. Good News was the Forties take on the 1927 hit Broadway show, which had been filmed once before in 1930. Most of the music is by the prolific Twenties  team of Ray Henderson with Lew Brown and Buddy DeSylva, responsible for Black Bottom, Birth of the Blues, Bye Bye Blackbird, Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries, Button Up Your Overcoat and many other standards including this show's hit song, the Best things In Life Are Free. Though the setting of the show remained Tait College in the Twenties, the fashion of the Forties was to acknowledge the setting while making sure all the costumes, hairstyles and musical arrangements were contemporary. So in this case the girls all look forties and the music is big band swing (but remember, it's 1927). Varsity Drag, the song most out of sync with the Forties style was thankfully retained to provide some Twenties flavor.

I only mention the anachronisms for people who aren't familiar with the way Hollywood did things then and who might be confused about this portrayal of the Roaring twenties. Nothing at all depends upon any historical recreation, and the breezy plot could happen just the same in any decade. Big Man On Campus Tommy Marlowe, a football hero to boot, likes snobby and affected Pat McClellan, but she is a dedicated gold digger looking for a rich boy to marry. He has grade problems in French and must be tutored by prim Librarian Connie Lane, who develops a crush on him. Will he get the grades to win the Big Game for Tait? Will connie get her man? I think we all know the answers to these questions, but the fun is in getting there.

The film has a good cast with Peter Lawford as Tommy, June Allyson as Connie and Patricia Marshall as Pat . More than that the leads hang out with a great bunch of friends who include Joan McCracken as Babe, Ray McDonald as Bobby, and a young Mel Torme as Danny.  Character actor Clinton Sundberg gives a nice performance as Professor Burton Kennyon, given more screen time than he usually got in films. The songs are nice, if mostly not memorable and there are several standout dance numbers. The highlight is Pass That Peace Pipe a song written directly for this film by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane with Roger Edens. It's a rousing swing number, and man, does that local malt shop jump!

It doesn't add up to much but some light entertainment but it fills that bill quite well. Both june Allyson and Peter Lawford actually seem a bit old for their rolls and in fact Allyson was 30;  Lawford, 24, always had that sophisticated British gentleman thing going for him that mad him seem older. But  as a show, Good News never tries too hard to seem real, so a cast mostly in their mid-twenties is not really a problem.

If you like forties musicals, don't miss this one.",1465603200,2,2895,4.521988527724665

1353254,5,B00004TZRZ,"With the help of Comden and Green, this vintage Broadway show of the '20's and bouncy 1930 early film musical, was turned into a first rate 1947 production starring June Allyson, Joan McCracken (of the stage's Oklahoma), Mel Torme, and, as the Big Man on Campus, Peter Lawford. I hadn't seen it for a decade or more, when I put this disc in the machine and had a most joyous experience. Frankly, I had forgotten just how much fun could be had at one of those Hollywood musicals could be when put into the hands of competent people. The story remains the same as in the original, a college setting, Football is King, the Star Player was IT, and all the girls and boys hung out in the soda parlor, where they sang and danced. That's about all there is to it: she loves him, he loves another, he gets in trouble, she helps him out of it, he realizes he is in love with her, big finale. Its the music, dancing and the verve of the performers that makes it click...or fall into the muck. This one has the songs from the original touched up by an incomparable team and with a lively, competent cast led by McCracken and Allyson. Peter Lawford is made to look good dancing and singing, handling the minimal acting chores well while Mel Torme is stylish if you can adapt to his voice.
All-in-all, just plain fun with fine individual solos and ensemble song and dance numbers.
Generally, I do not watch the 'extra's', but in this one I recommend two segments, in total taking up only a few minutes. First, two song and dance numbers from the 1930 film which one could see rather frequently on one of the old movie channels some years ago. They are fun. The second is a number from the 1947 film which  was cut out of the final release. It, too, is worth seeing.",1419984000,,1752,4.3577981651376145

1353256,5,B00004TZRZ,"A slightly uneven but colorful and thoroughly enjoyable movie musical from MGM, 1947, carrying over some of the songs and most of the innocence of the 1920s Broadway original, and set in that era.  June Allyson cemented her hold as America's Sweetheart playing Connie Lane, a sweet girl working her way through Tait College, stuck with the difficult task of tutoring the football team's failing hero, Tommy Marlowe, improbably cast and played by Peter Lawford.  Standout songs include ""Lucky In Love,"" ""The Best Things In Life Are Free,"" and ""The French Lesson,"" though, aside from the ""Varsity Drag"" prom number that closes the show, the standout production number is ""Pass That Peace Pipe"" by the underappreciated Joan McCracken.  With stalwart support from the likes of Connie Gilchrist and Clifton Sundberg -- and a young Mel Torme, whom the producers didn't really know how to use but who is wonderful to behold.  Yes, it's a little unreal as nostalgia goes, but then so was ANIMAL HOUSE.  Recommended.",1416960000,2,1007,5.042168674698795

With the exception of Mel Torme, the singing is bland.
June Allyson, (a silver blond Judy Garland knock off) looks older than the part requires.
This is just a  fluff piece to show off some dance steps & let everyone have a chance to sing.
Everyone acts their part, but you just don't care.
Peter Lawford's just there for his looks, that pretty much sums up everyone's presence !
Love the era, but not this grade B of a cheeseball.

1353275,5,B00004TZRZ,"Years ago I ate in the same restaurant as June Allison and rushed home to get a piece of sheet music I had for the song PASS THAT PEACE PIPE from her first musical hit, GOOD NEWS. She was still dining when I returned with the sheet music, and she was gracious enough to personally sign it for me. I had it framed and hung it on the wall behind my baby grand where it has remained for decades. June is no longer with us and I only had minimal knowledge of the musical when I saw the DVD offered on amazon.com. I only knew that it was her first musical and that it was a hit with the younger generation of the time; the first of it's kind to draw the kind of box office numbers previously set only by Judy Garland and Micky Rooney collaborations. GOOD NEWS is nothing more than a fast paced romp, a bit of fluff from the Arthur Freed musical comedy factory at MGM, but it is a perfect example of it's genre in glorious technicolor. After living with that signed melody all of these years, I was thrilled to also secure the film that introduced it. If you want to escape just to feel good for absolutely no good reason, you can't do better than GOOD NEWS!",1375574400,,1152,4.147321428571429

It was produced by Arthur Freed, who made those great Gene Kelly musicals, especially SINGIN IN THE RAIN(1952),  The story line was typical musical college storyline - girl pines over boy, boy not interested, girl not interested, boy excited and interested.

1353281,4,B00004TZRZ,"Produced by Arthur Freed and Directed by Charles Waters, 'Good News"" is a pleasant little musical that tells the story of a football hero who falls in love with his French tutor.

MGM sweetheart, June Allyson plays Connie Lane, a brainy student who is working her way through college as an assistant Librarian.  Peter Lawford plays Tommy Marlowe a football star who is trying to win over snooty sorority girl, Pat McClellan (Patricia Marshall) by taking up her favorite language, French. When Connie gives Tommy a quick lesson in French vocabulary, the sparks fly, and trouble begins.

Like most MGM musicals, the plot is secondary to the wonderful music and choreography that is used in the dance numbers. Allyson is a decent singer, but when she belts out,""The Best Things In Life Are Free"", you can't really appreciate the beauty of the song until Mel Torme sings it later in the movie.  However, as she is singing, ""Just Imagine"",  the camera moves in for a closeup of her face, and her expression conveys longing for love, and the grief the heart must bear when someone breaks it.  Peter Lawford was not a singer, I am surprised that his voice wasn't dubbed, but I think that if it was, his charm meter might have been lowered a bit too much, and it would have made his character seem even more caddish than he was.

Then there was the dancing.  The Varsity Drag, and Pass That Peace Pipe numbers, are worth the price of the movie.  Pass That Peace Pipe, was a marvelous dance routine, and two of the very best young dancers that MGM had at that time, Joan McCracken and Ray McDonald, performed it with so much joy, energy and enthusiasm, that once you see it, you'll never forget it.  In The Varsity Drag, Allyson and Lawford dance effortlessly, leading the supporting cast and extras in splendidly choreographed lock step.

All in all, Good News is an enjoyable little musical that entertains you with characters that you come to know and care about.  It is a must-see for any MGM musical fan.

1353286,4,B00004TZRZ,"Musicals with a college setting have always been a popular ticket, with shows like ON YOUR TOES, PIGSKIN PARADE, and BEST FOOT FORWARD classics of their kind on both stage and screen.  But the grandaddy of them all is GOOD NEWS, which proved a smash hit on the stage, opening in 1927 and playing over five hundred fifty performances--an unheard of run for that time.  In 1930 the show went Hollywood, and in about 1940 was slated for a remake with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, but when the cameras finally rolled on the project it was 1947 and the stars were Peter Lawford and June Allyson.

The story is flyweight stuff.  Tommy (Lawford) is the big man on campus, the college football star and lady killer; Connie (Allyson) is the extremely practical, pretty but unglamorous girl who falls for him in a big way.  Unfortunately, Tommy has eyes for another, and it isn't until the college is on the verge of loosing the big game that he sees the era of his ways.  Lawson can't sing worth a damn, but Allyson certainly can, and when it comes to dance they equal each other in energy and precision--but the real noise in GOOD NEWS is Joan McCracken as Babe.  In a perfect world, McCracken's performance would have been an early step in a long and remarkable career, but McCracken developed a number of health issues that prevented her from working.  GOOD NEWS is one of her few films, but it stands in testimony to what might have been: her performance of the title song and of ""Pass That Peace Pipe"" (written specifically for this film) are knock-outs all the way.  Mel Torme also makes an early film appearance, performing ensembles and a reprise of ""The Best Things In Life Are Free.""

Although set in the 1920s, the show looks and sounds suspiciously 1940-something, relying more on costumes, choreography, and musical arrangements more contemporary than historical--but what the heck, its all in good fun, and as usual on an MGM ""A"" production the whole thing looks spectacular.  Director Charles Walters, whose other credits include EASTER PARADE, THE BARCLAYS OF BROADWAY, and SUMMER STOCK to name but a few, keeps the pace tight.  The DVD offers an interesting feature: two songs from the original 1930 film version as performed by Penny Singleton (then known as Dorothy McNulty), ""Good News"" and ""Varsity Drag.""  Her performing style in these is very much late 1920s-early 1930s, so it gives viewers a chance to see what the original style was like.  GOOD NEWS isn't really among the truly great MGM musicals, but it is a fun show all the same, and musical fans will adore it.  Recommended.

1353287,4,B00004TZRZ,"I actually enjoyed this movie.  It is very light-hearted but charming in its own way.  The two people I watched it with didn't care for it.  As they thought the song and dance numbers were too long.  Which for a normal movie they would be, but since it is a Broadway style musical it fits the genre.  So with that being said, you'll enjoy this movie if you bear in mind that it is a Broadway show, which mean harsh music and vapid plots.  But, hey, sometimes light entertainment has its place.  This show centers around a college football star who is used to having the girls come up to him.  But with the entrance of this new finishing school graduate upon the scene, he meets the first girl who shuns him.  After all, she's after a fellow who has millions behind his name.  In order to impressive her then, the football star tries to learn French (as the finishing school girl loves to throw around her French) whereupon he runs into the intelligent library assistant portrayed by June Allyson.  He and June's character fall in love, but then the finishing school girl gets word that the football star has millions behind his name after all.  So now we get quite a twist in the plot!
  Consequently,  I do recommend this  movie.  As it has its merit.  There are better ones out there, but there are certainly plenty that are far worse.",1277510400,,1337,4.454545454545454

The plot is thinner than a wafer, the characters have little substance and the situations are cliche to say the least.  But it works wonderfully!  In the best tradition of the MGM musical, GOOD NEWS is a rollicking good time.

Tait College's star football player Tommy Marlowe (Peter Lawford) looks set to flunk the mid-terms--and miss the chance of leading his teammates to victory--unless his grades are pulled into shape.  Assigned to help tutor him in French is no-nonsense sorority leader Connie Lane (June Allyson).  Before you can say ""opposites attract"", these two battling co-eds find love whilst hitting the books; until snooty new girl Pat (Patricia Marshall) decides to sink her catty claws into Tommy!

Highlighted by the energetic dance numbers ""Pass That Peace-Pipe"" (originally intended for ""Ziegfeld Follies"") and ""The Varsity Drag"", GOOD NEWS is a great big bouncy ball of musical fun.  June Allyson and Peter Lawford tackle the tour-de-force ""French Lesson"", Mel Torme croons ""The Best Things in Life are Free"", and June Allyson tugs at the heart with the lovely ballad ""Just Imagine"".

This movie also boasts two of the most talented dancers from the period, Joan McCracken and Ray McDonald, paired together in comedic secondary roles.  Sadly both would die young without realising their full potential in movie musicals.  Savour their adorable work in GOOD NEWS.

The DVD from Warners includes a song deleted from the final cut of the film (""An Easier Way""), plus the ""Good News"" and ""Varsity Drag"" numbers from the original 1930 movie--which has sadly yet to appear on DVD.  Recommended.",1247270400,,1771,5.107638888888889
1353292,4,B00004TZRZ,"This film is dear to many fans of old movie musicals because in so many ways it shows MGM's Arthur Freed Unit at its best. The producers, its director (Charles Walters, in his first film effort) and its screenwriters (Betty Comden and Adolph Green, also in their first major Hollywood project) put this silly, unpretentious adaptation of the 1927 DeSylva - Brown- Henderson stage musical of the same together and let themselves absolutely fun with it, which translates terrifically onto the screen. What makes the film so likable is how they seem to have gauged the songs and especially the dancing exactly right, so that the musical numbers are marvelous but they never call too much attention to themselves. The film's musical highlight--the novelty number ""Pass that Peace Pipe,"" written especially for this adaptation by  Comden and Green and Roger Edens, and led by the charismatic Joan McCracken--wows you with its choreographic inventiveness and energy, but then the film wisely moves on quickly.

Peter Lawford might not have been an ideal song and dance man for the leading role of the vain and popular football captain Tommy Marlowe, but he is more than pleasant enough and gets by on charm. June Allyson fares even better as his frustrated love interest Connie; this was the film that really cemented Allyson's stardom, and she's just about perfect in the role. It can be hard for younger audiences to understand Allyson's appeal--besides her whiskey voice, she always had terrible Forties sausage hairdos and the studio always purposefully dressed her frumpily to trade on her girl next door image as ""The Perfect Wife"" (the MGM promotional department's tagline for her). But she does contrast very well with the usual MGM glamour gals of the time (here represented by Patricia Marshall, in the film's only less than robust lead performance), and she does winningly convey intelligence, (a quality rarely valued in musicals, and spirit. Best of all, she's a terrific dancer, and when she really kicks loose in the closing ""Varsity Drag"" number she's great fun. Be on the lookout for Mel Torm in a smaller role where he doesn't have to act hardly at all but does get some elbow ring for his gorgeous singing (he enjoys a long reprise of the film's big Broadway ballad ""The Best Things in Life are Free). The cinematography on this print is sharp and gorgeous; the hairdos are more Forties than Twenties, but the sets look expensively suitable. The extras are terrific in the big numbers, and don't overwhelm with too much incessant smiling, the way they can sometimes in other Freed Unit musicals.",1238198400,2,2608,4.965675057208238
1353293,4,B00004TZRZ,"This DVD was first released in the year 2000, and the transfer is a bit fuzzy for my taste. I'm surprised that Warner Bros. hasn't touched it up and rereleased it by now, but then I have the same complaint with ""The Music Man"".

The musical itself is everything you expect from an MGM musical of the late 1940's - rather light on story and heavy on visual style and good music. I've had the advantage of seeing the original movie musical from 1930, at least what's left of it, which is actually the entire film minus the Technicolor finale. That original has the disadvantage of not having the technical advantages in sound recording and camera mobility. However, the original 1930 movie does have the character of Babe being played by the pixie-like Bessie Love of ""Broadway Melody of 1929"", and she is every inch the mischievious flapper that Joan McCracken just is not. In fact, the coeds in the 1947 film seem very much like they're from 1947, they're just dressed up in the fashions and driving the cars of the 1920's.

In this film, Connie (June Allyson) is tutoring Tommy (Peter Lawford) in French just as in the 1930 version. However, there are two big differences here. In the 1947 film, Lawford's motivation for studying French is to win the affection of a beautiful new student. Also, Tommy knows exactly who Connie is, and their attraction builds slowly. In the 1930 film, the first time Tommy sees Connie she isn't exactly wildly attractive, but she is the best student in the subject at the college. Also, Tommy is already enrolled in French, he is just in danger of failing it and not being able to play in the big game. Also notice in this later film the presence of a very young Mel Torme who seems to be standing in for Cliff Edwards from the 1930 version, complete with ukelele.

This DVD release has some great extras, including the ""Varsity Drag"" and ""Good News"" musical excerpts from the 1930 film. I suggest Warner Bros. upgrade this film using the current DVD technology. Also, 1930 version of ""Good News"" in its entirety would be great as an extra feature on a new release of the 1947 film.",1235779200,,2115,4.58994708994709
1353294,5,B00004TZRZ,"Good News...what can I say about this movie? It's one of my favorites!
The story is about Connie Lane (June Allyson) and Tommy Marlowe (Peter Lawford). Tommy is the big man on campus, why he's captain of the football team! Then he meets Pat McLellan (Patricia Marshall) and she couldn't care less. She only wants a man for his wealth *ahem* of culture! So While Tommy is trying to figure out how to win Pat he meets Connie. And, well that's really where it starts get interesting.
The B plot is about Bobby Turner ( Ray McDonald) and Babe Doolittle (Joan McCracken). Babe is dating football player Beef (Sadly I can't remember that actor's name!) but she's crazy about little ol' Bobby, who's scared to death of Beef!
Oddly enough, the very first time I watched it I hated it. I thought it was one of the worst movies ever made! But, it got under my skin. It grew on me. The story really is pretty cute, and the acting is great and well, you have to give Mr. Lawford credit for singing because it was most definately not his strong point! The dancing is also very good, I only wish there was more! And it really is pretty funny to see everyone run around in the 1940's version of the 20's (it was still terribly, terribly, terribly, 40's. No matter how many times they called the girls flappers, it didn't change the fact.)  Something else fun, on the DVD they included two numbers from the movie version that came out in the 20's. I don't know exactly how to describe them, so I won't.
If you want to watch a light (and I do mean light!) musical, This one is great! And really, I personally don't think you can go wrong if Peter Lawford is in it...his er, unique singing voice I think only makes him more charming!

P.S. For all of you Mel Torme fans, he has a small role in the film as Danny. He sings a couple of songs and even has a few lines! A couple of them are pretty funny too!",1210204800,,1886,4.280112044817927
1353295,5,B00004TZRZ,"The singing voice of Peter Lawford will not blow you away; there are no huge stars in this movie; yet, the songs, witty Comden & Greene script, and energy of the performers make it an often overlooked gem of the MGM Musical library. June Allyson leads the way as a totally believable college girl who must work her way through school and doesn't get the man until the end. Peter Lawford gives a nice performance and dances up a storm as the college football star. The picture is incredible; razor sharp and bursting with technicolor splendor. Mel Torme has a small part, and although his singing adds a nice touch to the movie, it's hard to believe him as a college student. A few nice extras; one deleted musical number which denies Patricia Marshall another solo turn (but rightfully so; it would only have slown down the nice pacing of the film), a theatrical trailer, and two numbers from the 1930 version. Although the two numbers are very dated, they are fun to watch, and it's a shame they couldn't put the entire movie on this disc.",1192320000,,1040,4.566844919786096

The part where she and the sorority house mother are misleading Pat (Patricia Marshall) about Tommy's (Peter Lawford) family loosing its money and his father no longer being the ""pickle king"" is a hoot. Miss Allyson's singing is in more of a Broadway than motion picture musical style. However, it fits her character, Connie, who is an All American Girl type, not a glamour gal. Peter Lawford also puts on a credible show in his singing and dancing. The supporting cast is excellent. Joan McCracken shows off her dancing prowess in the ""Pass the Peace Pipe"" number. An example of the MGM musical in its prime.",1156723200,5,735,4.7952755905511815
1353300,3,B00004TZRZ,"The death of June Allyson this past week is reason enough to revisit one of her most important starring vehicles, this wholesome 1947 MGM college musical from the golly-gee-whiz school of entertainment. Based on a pre-Depression-era stage hit, it's all pretty ridiculous but very sincere with random moments of clever comedy thanks to the formidable team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green with their first screenplay effort. The thin plot involves exuberant co-eds at Tait College and two in particular, conscientious good girl Connie Lane and football hero Tommy Marlowe. The closest thing the film comes to drama is the risk Tommy faces in not being able to play in the big game if he cannot pass his French class, and you can guess who is the only who can tutor him. There is inevitably a snooty gold-digger out to steal Tommy from Connie under the assumption that he is an heir to a pickle fortune. And naturally, there are hijinks galore among the co-eds who have a more vested interest in the big game than their own studies.

The trivial nature of the film is offset primarily by two things. First, there is Allyson, who exudes cornbelt, girl-next-door appeal effortlessly. With her froggy voice and twinkly smile, she shines as Connie despite the fact that she is not inordinately talented as either singer or dancer. As Tommy, Lawford is actually a better dancer than you would expect, but his character is such a flighty dullard that he comes across as rather silly. The second notable factor is a wonderful bouncing ball of a dancer named Joan McCracken, a Broadway performer who plays Connie's comic sidekick Babe Doolittle. Shamefully an obscure footnote now, she is the dynamic center of the energetic if somewhat politically incorrect ""Pass the Peace Pipe"" production number, a dazzling example of finely coordinated MGM choreography at its best. Another example of that craftsmanship is the final ""Varsity Drag"" number where dozens of dancers impressively replicate the moves of Allyson and Lawford in synchronized lockstep. This will definitely not suit everyone's taste, even lovers of MGM musicals, but it is a worthy tribute to Allyson's appeal and the kind of musical that would never be made again without some hint of cynicism.",1153008000,8,2249,4.997333333333334
1353301,4,B00004TZRZ,"With the recent passing of the lovely and classy June Allyson, we lose yet another bonafide star from the golden age of cinema. June Allyson exuded down-to-earth charm and a certain girl-next-door accessibility. She was perenially typecast as the ""nice girl."" No, she wasn't classicaly beautiful, being widely considered more cute than anything. But I've always  preferred her to more aloof, cool beauties such as Lana Turner and Hedy Lamarr. June's distinct scratchy voice, which was warm and endearingly unique, had me captivated from the get-go. My favorite movies starring June are Two Girls and a Sailor (1944), Music for Millions (1944), The Three Musketeers (1948), Little Women (1949), and, of course, Good News (1947).

Set in the college campus of Tait University in 1927, Good News mainly tells the tale of college football hero Tommy Marlowe (British Peter Lawford), a collegiate Romeo of long standing. But, to his chagrin, he doesn't get anywhere with newly arrived co-ed Pat McClellan (Patricia Marshall), who espouses French culture and spouts dubious French verbalisms. He gets library assistant Connie Lane (June Allyson) to tutor him in French. In the course of things (and because Allyson and Lawford are the two leads), Connie and Tommy are soon making moon eyes at each other. But the jeopardy in the film surfaces when Pat decides she's interested in Tommy after all.

Good News, an MGM release, is a lively film peopled with young, energetic folk. The effervescent musical numbers are uniformly performed with giddy exuberance and robust athleticism. Nearly every song is a show stopper: from the opening ""Good News""; the fun French learning song, a rapid, tongue-twisting French duet excursion by Lawford and Allyson; speedily  followed by the wistful standard ""The Best Things in Life Are Free,"" as winsomely warbled by June; the excellently choreographed ""Pass the Peace Pipe""; to the culminating cardiovascular-friendly ""The Varsity Drag."" Joan McCracken as Connie's roommate Babe Doolittle is a flat out delight, stealing loadfuls of scenes. All of her enthusiastic musical renderings (""Good News,"" ""Pass the Peace Pipe"") are  highlights. Look for a Velvet Fog cameo reprising ""The Best Things in Life Are Free.""

While it's mostly about the songs, the plot is not without its appeal. For example, the scene of Connie and Cora the cook doing a reading from a script concocted for Pat's eavesdropping pleasure is a hoot.

The underwhelming special features is anchored by the deleted number ""An Easier Way"" sung by June Allyson.

The acting is up to standards, with Allyson and Lawford emoting admirably. Patricia Marshall is appropriately hateful as the haughty, scheming Pat. And to reiterate, Joan McCracken is an unrestrained delight. Good job by everyone - Good News, indeed.",1153008000,3,2808,5.252232142857143
1353302,3,B00004TZRZ,"Good News is a frivolous college story. It revolves around a campus filled with energetic youths falling in and out of love with each other. Like most teen movies, it is filled with stereotypes and the main characters are involved in a love triangle. There is a football player (Peter Lawford), the beautiful transfer student (Patricia Marshall), and the frumpy library worker with a heart of gold (June Allyson).

The film is supposed to be set in the 1920s, but the film is very obviously of its own time. The outfits look like the early 1950s even though they've been slightly altered to look like flapper dresses. Everything is very fitted, nothing like the shapeless dresses of the 20s. Some of the music, like the background music, is genuinely historical, but most of the musical songs sound more modern. This causes the film to suffer a bit. ""The Best Things in Life Are Free"" is a nice song, but the others are sort of bland, even though ""Pass That Peace Pipe"" was nominated for an Oscar.

""The Varsity Drag"" ending is excellent, the best part of the film. Not only is the song great, but the large dance sequence is equally great. It provides a silly ending to a silly film, but it is done with a lot of class and sophistication.",1147132800,5,1239,4.576576576576577

It's amazing how even this lesser musical is so much better than what the other studios, or even other producers at M-G-M, were turning out.  We've enjoyed it on VHS for several years (it makes a great ""back to school"" family movie to watch every fall).  I'm glad it's now available on DVD.

Why Lawford was given the male lead in this film remains a mystery.  As an actor he is completely wooden and as a singer...well....let's just skip that.  He seems bored to death in his role and I just don't understand why June Allyson would be attracted to him after the way he uses her in the film.  The musical numbers are what make this film stand out.....especially ""Lucky in Love"", ""Pass that Peace Pipe"" and ""Varsity Drag"".  Forties hairstyles and, at times, forties costumes permeate throughout the film which is supposedly set in 1927.  Somebody was asleep at the switch in this department.  If they had cast a more believable and much more dynamic leading man, the movie would have been great.  Also miscast is the femme fatale, the girl named Pat who has all the guys clamoring for her.  She doesn't exude the kind of sex appeal needed for the part as she is more a girl-next-door type so it makes the story less plausible.  ""Good News"" is good fun, nevertheless, its flaws notwithstanding.  It certainly isn't the finest musical MGM ever made....that title belongs to either ""Singing in the Rain"" or the universally loved ""The Wizard of Oz"".  The remastering of the film is beautiful, the sound is excellent and for extras we have a trailer of the film, a deleted musical number, subtitles, scene index and an interesting excerpt of the  production number of ""The Varsity Drag"" from the 1930 film version.",1124496000,,1578,4.796296296296297

Charles Walters has done such wonderful, memorable movie such as: Easter Parade, Summer Stock... But  maybe Good News is one of the best! Good News is about a girl named Connie (June Alison), who never was really noticed by the other guys at her college: Tait.

Particularly, the boy that all the girls like: Tommy Harlow (Peter Lawford). Wait a minute, all girls except one. The horrible, snobby, mean, selfish, scheming, not really that pretty, self centered, terrible: Pat McClellan (Parricia Marshall). Tommy is a lady's man who really just thinks he's got it all. And falls for every pretty face. So when Pat comes to the college Tommy does everything in his power to get the girl to fall in love with him. But Pat has other ideas. Pat is only after one thing: $Money$ And that is why she chases Tommy away for the 25 million dollar Peter VanDyne the III. Crestfallen at his first brush off, Tommy determindedly sets to learning Pat's beloved language french. To make an impression, and to steal Pat's admiration. So, Tommy sets off the library to learn some french, when he meets the sweet, lovely Connie.

Where he makes Connie fall desperately in love with him, and even a little in love with her. So, he ends up asking her to the prom, and breaking the date when Babe Dolittle Connie room mate (Joan McCkraken) feeling sorry for Tommy tells Pat that Tommy is the Pickle King with thirty million dollars. The fortune hunger quickly turns to Tommy to his delight and satisfaction. Dropping Connie completely. Angry, jealous, and hurt, but still very much in love, Connie schemes to draw her Tommy back in her life and into her arms.

It has easily become one of my favourites because of its youthful exuberance and great music. I have a number of movies with Peter Lawford in my collection, and in most such as Royal Wedding and Easter Parade, Peter is the backup or shares the romantic lead. Good News is different in that he has the main romantic lead and so we get to see him more often. Peter Lawford and June Allyson are a great pair and have such great romantic chemistry.
This movie features the song ""The Best Things in Life are Free"" (you know the song that was used in phone commercials years ago? lol) and it is the love theme for the characters in the movie. June Allyson does a moving presentation of the song. Both Allyson and Lawford are just so cute in this movie. Peter Lawford portrays the football star, Tommy Marlowe, who learns French in order to impress the new student, and most recent love interest, Pat McCellan (Patricia Marshall), only to fall in love with his French tutor, Connie Lane (Allyson) along the way!

French is such an integral part of the story that the captions and English subtitles on the DVD actually include both languages. However the French subtitles are not as complete.

1353311,5,B00004TZRZ,"GOOD NEWS has long been a favorite musical of mine:  on the stage, on a recording, on VHS and now, delightfully, on a DVD with several Extra Features which are both surprising and very entertaining.
First the movie, itself:  Betty Comden and Adolph Green are in top form here only about four years before their work on, arguably, the finest movie musical ever made SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  The dialogue here is funny, sharp, clever and altogether very happily silly.  The song they added to the Broadway score, ""The French Lesson"" for stars Peter Lawford and June Allyson is one of the true highlights in this pretty to look at, MGM college caper.  It's the all-too familiar story of the football hero who must pass a course (yes, it's French!)and to do so, he must be tutored by the co-ed he dumped for her much more glamourous rival.  Guess what?  He passes the course, Tate College wins the big football game, the rival gets the rich boyfriend she deserves and Lawford gets Allyson.
In the supporting cast beautiful Patricia Marshall is charmingly funny as the snooty sorority girl who has no trouble attracting men and Joan McCracken as the tomboyish 'Babe' who dances up a storm in one of the movie's best numbers, ""Pass That Peacepipe"" which is, probably, in today's climate, far from politically correct.  Also in the cast is a dusky-voiced, very young singer you may have heard of named Mel Torme.
As for the DVD Extras, the most interesting is a song number for Allyson, Marshall and the sorority girls which was cut from the finished picture called ""An Easier Way"" which could be a variation on Comden and Green's ""100 Easy Ways"" from WONDERFUL TOWN. Even better are two song and dance numbers from the 1930 movie version of GOOD NEWS with a singer/dancer/comedienne named Penny Singleton who is absolutely priceless.
It goes without saying that the color, settings and costume designs for this movie are tops.  After all, the movie was made by MGM.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1015113600,13,1977,4.771260997067449

And fabulous tunes sung as only Mel Torme could sing 'em! Fabulous dance numbers, even if dated (""Pass the Peace Pipe"" for one). And many pre-WWI references (""the bees knees!"")

She sings, he listens, the camera almost never moves, and we're forced to listen to Hollywood's most non-musical performer assault our ears in a song that seems to never end.
But this is quite wrong. Just look at how the camera has been used, and how the song has been choreographed with great subtlety. It looks to me like june allyson actually made a mistake in the routine, she looks down to her right twice towards the end of the song, and it looks to me like the first time was too early, so she did it again where it had been intended. Nevertheless, this does not detract from a superbly sung and presented song.",984096000,3,895,4.463414634146342
1353314,2,B00004TZRZ,"How this musical from l947 escaped the glorious, legendary Arthur Freed unit--which produced ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", ""Singin' In the Rain,"" etc.-- at MGM is a mystery. Two non-musical newcomers--pert, girl-next-door June Allyson and handsome, boyish Peter Lawford-were given the main musical numbers and nearly destroyed this Technicolor mess. Supposedly set in the l920s, you'd never know it by seeing all these l940s jitter-bugging bobbysoxers sporting very l947 hair-dos. Allyson sounds like Butterfly McQueen with a hangover and Lawford is so off-key, you would think he was auditioning for the Three Stooges. The only reason for buying this DVD is the vervy, adorable Joan McCracken who plays Babe, and her big number, ""Pass the Peace Pipe"", is MGM at its best. You probably saw it in the ""That's Dancing"" compilation from l985. The big mystery is why Joan never made any more movies. She married big-time choreographer, Bob Fosse, and his wild private life was probably more than enough to keep her busy. She died tragically young in l961. Another big mystery is why all the guys are so attracted to the boring, bland, humorless Patricia Marshall who vanished from the Hollywood scene after this movie. One big plus for this DVD is watching the bizarre musical sequences starring Penny Singleton (i.e, ""Blondie"") from the l930 MGM version of ""Good News."" In the style of the era, she stomps the floors and shakes her head and sounds horrible. She and the ungainly chorus guys and girls are still fascinating to watch in the pre-Busby Berkely era of dance numbers. The biggest disaster in watching the 1947 version of ""Good News"" is the one classic song that we still hear today, ""The Best Things in Life Are Free."" Allyson sings this ditty in her tuneless, hollow voice to Peter Lawford in a medium shot. Nothing happens. She sings, he listens, the camera almost never moves, and we're forced to listen to Hollywood's most non-musical performer assault our ears in a song that seems to never end. Joan McCracken--now completley forgotten--should have had the femme lead and who knows what this would have done to her mysterious career that never happened.",979603200,6,2161,5.0055555555555555
1353315,4,B00004TZRZ,"This version of ""Good News"" (there was a 1930 adaptation) takes the wonderful musical score (plus some interpolated standards), and folds it into a terrifically innocent, fast, and joyful plot about 1920s college kids, the big football game, and the brainy student (June allyson) who tutors, then falls in love with, the gridiron hero (Peter Lawford).  There were greater musicals produced by MGM in the '40s and '50s than this one, but even the best of those (""The Band Wagon"", ""Singin' in the Rain"") are hard pressed to match the sheer energy and sparkle of this ""minor"" MGM tuner.  Everything about ""Good News"" works effortlessly, and the fun is amped up considerably by the straight-ahead kinetics of the numbers.  From the title song (done on the front steps of the fictional Tait College), through the jazzy specialty ""pass That Peace Pipe"", on to the genuinely exciting finale to ""The Varisty Drag"", the arrangements have snap and drive, and the choreography is equal to the scoring in impact.
On DVD, the Technicolor picture is vibrant, sharp, and steady.  The monophonic sound is fairly strong considering the age of the film; overall the presentation is top notch.  The extras include two staggeringly campy musical excerpts from the 1930 version, featuring a pre-""Blondie"" Penny Singleton scrunching up her face and pounding out the lumbering dance steps to horse-y versions of the title song and ""The Varsity Drag"".  Very funny and a great complement to the exuberance of the 1947 version.",970444800,18,1501,5.05668016194332
1353316,5,B00004TZRZ,"This is one of the best musicals I have seen. Peter Lawford as a rich football hero and June Allyson, a hard working librarian/sorority girl. With great songs by Joan McCracken and Mel Torme. This movie is a great  romantic comedy. It is a must see.",962409600,7,249,4.413043478260869
1353317,5,B00004TZRZ,"I discovered this toe-tapping musical by accident my freshmen year of  college and I have never enjoyed another film quite so much!  Made in the  golden years of the MGM musical production frenzy, ""Good News"" is  a shining star that, sadly, for years was forgotten.
""Good  News"" is the story of a senior at Tait college who works as the school  librarian (June Allison).  Having worked hard throughout her years at Tait,  she has been largely ignored by the superficial fraternity boys.  This  changes when Tommy Marlow (Peter Lawford), captain of Tait's beloved  football team, asks her for French lessons.  The story is a little  predictable, but if you watch a musical for a suspenseful plot, I think you  are going to be continually disappointed.
The music numbers in this 1947  production are lively and brillantly written.  You will find yourself  humming such songs as ""Lucky in Love"" long after the show.  Mel  Torme plays a small role in the movie and treats us to a reprise of the  ballad ""The Best Things in Life are Free"".
True to MGM's style  the music is accentuated by stunning choreography.  ""Pass the Peace  Pipe"" and the ""Varsity Drag"", the show-stopping finale, are  wonderful examples of this.  Some may find, however, the pre-war treatment  of Native American traditions in ""Pass the Peacepipe"" to be  inappropriate in today's politically correct society. I personally found it  to be a wonderful reminder of how far we have come in that arena.
What I  love best about this musical is the strength given to June Allison's  character in a time when women weren't given much credit for more than  their pretty face and homemaking skills.  In this movie, she is a smart,  working woman, who, instead of wallowing in the fact she has no beau,  betters herself.  The sorority house relies on her for plumbing repair as  well as smoothing over cat fights.  Despite the wonderful music and dance  numbers, this is what makes ""Good News"" really worth while.  (How  refreshing to see the smart girl get the boy!  Especially the handsome  Peter Lawford!)
What a treat this movie has been re-released!",961718400,38,2111,4.830985915492958

Rogers and Hammerstein like her so much, they wrote a show for her;  ""Me and Juliet"").  She made only this one film.  It's worth  having and rewatching if for nothing other than her thrilling ""Pass  that Peace Pipe"" song and dance number.
