8673672,4,B00MP2JJJO,This was actual a good suspense movie. It started out a little slow for the first 5 of 6 minutes but it really picked up and had me on the edge of my seat at times during the movie. I couldn't stop watching this movie until the end. I think the ending could have been better but overall this was a good movie. You could tell during the movie it might have been a little low budget but that did not make a difference to me because it was good. I have seen some high budget movies that did not live up to their expectations so I judge a movie on more than just how much money was used to make a movie. I think the producer and actors did a great job and I would actual watch this movie again. I think it lived up to it's name.,1490054400,,724,3.865771812080537

8673676,5,B00MP2JJJO,Very relevant film to what actually IS going on scientifically behind our backs. Makes you think about how scientists and large orginizations conspire to achieve perfection in human testing groups.,1445904000,,197,5.6
8673677,5,B00MP2JJJO,"I just watched this film without knowing much about it and loved every minute of it. I'm a huge ""Travis Van Winkle"" fan so I was pleased he was one of the stars. This is what a horror /slasher movie should be. Great effects and lots of gore including an awesome decapitation with no cut away.

The storyline was interesting and I was never waiting for something exciting to happen because the entire film was a homerun in my opinion.

It had some great gross out moments and some creepy bite your lip moments as well. It's comparable to (Insanitarium) but better. I highly recommend this film.",1424736000,3,593,4.5327102803738315
8673678,4,B00MP2JJJO,"Bloodworx was better than i thought it would be. The story revolves around a group of people volunteering to be lab rats for a new drug. With most movies like this, Things don't go as planned as the test subjects develop side effects and become addicted to the drug causing them to kill. Bloodworx is definately worth a look. 8/10 Thanx for reading.",1414800000,,349,4.555555555555555
8673679,3,B00MP2JJJO,"Two college guys want to make some money by being in a clinical drug trial for what is supposed to be allergy pills, but of course it winds up being something possibly beneficial but sadly destructive and deadly instead.",1414368000,,220,4.666666666666667
8673680,3,B00MP2JJJO,This movie is very good. I stumbled across it in the Red Box and decided Why Not? A group of college kids are offered alot of money to be tested on in a closed lab. Each dose these kids receive the more rabid they become. The blood really starts to spill toward the last half hour. Eric Roberts plays a man in a suit. Thats it...kind of like Mr Shhh in The Things To Do in Denver When you re dead...Acting is decent and as the direction.. .  Makes you think twice about getting Bloodwork done ever again,1413417600,,503,4.13265306122449
