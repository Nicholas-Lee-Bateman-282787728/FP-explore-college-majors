3891413,3,B002AS45TC,"I finally watched this whole thing, looks very much slanted to the left.  These men that the movie tries to commend for cowardice are just that cowards.  As a former infantryman, I can tell you that these men are the types of guys who get real men killed.  If you are bleeding heart and think that war is bad, I agree with you, but to paraphrase the Major, sometimes you have to fight and you have to kill.",1472601600,3,406,4.17948717948718
3891414,5,B002AS45TC,"This documentary should be a '""must view"" for all high school age young men and women. Show it in school, in church, at home during a family time, but show it. Our nation's Department of Defense's Contentious Objector Directive only addresses those who are against all wars, not wars that might be declared unjust by individual conscience. To have a pacifist policy in the time of an ""all volunteer force"" does not make any sense to me. Does it make sense to you?  The struggles of those portrayed in this DVD are real, no mater what conclusion they come to, either for or against the war. The only short coming of the film is that it does not address those who object to unjust wars. The major Christian faith communities in the U.S. apply the criteria of the Just War Tradition to determine is a war is just or unjust. These criteria are the arena in which moral discussions inform the ethical decision if the war in just or not. Watching this DVD will provide an opportunity for our young people to do what our political community neglects doing, talking about when is it justified to use military force in the conduct of America's actions in the world.",1372118400,3,1156,4.5576923076923075
3891415,5,B002AS45TC,"This is a very well done documentary.  I've used it in classes I've taught on religious ethics and religion and violence; it gets a great reaction.  It shows both sides (although it focuses on the perspective of the pacifists) and represents several types of pacifism - Buddhist, non-religious, etc.",1363046400,2,299,5.081632653061225
3891416,5,B002AS45TC,"This film is a powerful, sensitive, and even handed portrayal of four very different men who go to Iraq and then decide to apply for conscientious objector status. The men are very generous in sharing their experiences and I came away from the film in awe of their humility and bravery, and inspired by their example.
Please see this film.",1260403200,7,339,4.666666666666667
3891417,5,B002AS45TC,"This is one of the BEST documentaries I have ever seen, tied only with _Why We Fight_ and _Heart of Stone_.

_Soldiers of Conscience_ is touching, inspiring, and educational.  I was perhaps most impressed with how *balanced* it was!  I would love to see this film shared with more and more people!  I believe that anyone can find him or herself represented in this film, and represented well.",1260316800,3,392,4.720588235294118
3891418,5,B002AS45TC,"As Co-Director of Soldier's Heart, a veterans' healing initiative, I heartily applaud this film. So many of the troops I have worked with and heard from are suffering from the wound of having fought in a war they did not believe in. Our military ideals are meant to forge the finest young men and women. But the realities on the battlefield so violate these values that they leave our sons and daughters in a moral and ethical hell that they live with for the rest of their lives. Soldiers of Conscience is an inspiring exploration of the moral act of saying no to the military and is proof of the true integrity of our serving men and women. This film is a courageous and essential statement, a message that needs to be heard. If you are interested in more about this topic, War and the Soul, by Edward Tick is a great exploration.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-the-Soul-Healing-Our-Nation-s-Veterans-from-Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder/dp/083560831X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and the Soul: Healing Our Nation's Veterans from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</a>",1260230400,5,1113,5.6706586826347305
3891419,5,B002AS45TC,"I saw this documentary and thought it should be ""required viewing"" in all high schools where you hear young men and women state how anxious they are to go kill the enemy. This documentary shows the uneven penalty given to five very different and brave men who file for CO (conscientious objecter) after having served their country in Iraq and discovered that, like Vietnam, they are there for very different reasons than what they signed up for.  This is a story that will leave you with doubts about current military training and compassion for the decision these men made to save their sanity.",1260144000,4,595,4.776699029126213
3891420,5,B002AS45TC,"I have watched Soldiers of Conscience three times now. It is one of the most pragmatic, optimistic, eloquent and fairly-conceived projects about the personal conscience of American men given guns and license to kill that I've ever seen. I am sustained by the thought that 75% of the men who see combat never pull the trigger. I pray for peace of mind for the remaining 25%.  The choice between defending an ideal you believe in with all your heart and recognizing the sanctity of any and every human life has to be a decision wrought with anguish and dread for every man. We would not be human otherwise.",1257379200,8,604,4.592592592592593

3891422,1,B002AS45TC,"This movie clearly was nothing more than a liberal hack job full of anti-war nuts.  We have an all volunteer military and most of which despise war but realize it is because of them that we enjoy the freedoms we have today.  To become a soldier means duty, honor and country, not get a job, free education and whine when asked to do your duty.  Killing and death are sometimes necessary and if you can't hack it, don't join.  When I saw the scenes of these ""objectors"" talking to college students at UC Berkeley, in knew right away where this was going.",1481068800,4,553,4.392156862745098

3891425,3,B002AS45TC,"This has a different look at the situation.  As the military is all volunteer, far fewer young men are faced with this contradiction of hour philosophy.  I cannot understand the country's thrill for military conflicts.",1475625600,,218,5.2

3891428,1,B002AS45TC,"Biased anti-war propaganda: The ""conscientious"" objector based his objection to war on the lies that we didn't find WMD. This was a despicable lie the leftists told to sew the seeds of dissent for political opportunistic gain. We most certainly did find WMD. He also regurgitated there was no link found between Saddam and Al Qaeda: There most certainly was. Al Qaeda was operating in Northern Iraq and the Clinton Administration proved the link in the 1998 Indictment of Osama Bin Laden...It was these filthy lies the Democrat party and their media prostitutes told to slowly sabotage the war effort...We liberated 50 million people from the evil of Saddam Hussein. He would still be mass murdering his people if these traitors had their way.

The abject bias of this propaganda is disgusting.",1474848000,4,794,5.015151515151516
3891429,5,B002AS45TC,Very interesting look at the men and few women that choose to serve in the military but do not want to kill another human in combat.,1474156800,,132,4.115384615384615

8360204,1,B002AS45TC,this movie is typical left wing programming. very unbalanced time and seriousness given to the other side of the question. i expected a movie that was close to 50/50. this sure is NOT!,1504051200,,184,4.606060606060606

8360206,5,B002AS45TC,"That's got to be one of the best documentaries about the war in Iraq. It's great because it's told from the perspective of soldiers who spent time there. They saw things and had the strength to question their own morality. They had the courage to stand up and make the difficult decision to do what they felt was right, even though they would be facing terrible consequences. But they did it anyway. That's true strength and conviction.",1500336000,,436,4.675324675324675
8360207,1,B002AS45TC,"An attempt by deserters to justify their decision to abandon their promise to America and to their fellow soldiers, under the guise of Conscious Objector. They deserted, ran away, abandoned their posts. Left others to fight to preserve our way of life, and to give others that same life.  They are not soldiers, they are deserters.",1489708800,,331,4.910714285714286
8360208,1,B002AS45TC,"I was not at all happy with this movie. It made me ANGRY. I am not in the military but I have had family and others in the military and I can assure you, they wouldn't be flying this bull crap. What's the point of being in the military if your going to be a ""conscience objector""? I get it, I understand, but if that is what you are going INTO the military as, what's the bother? If you've watched ""13 Hours"" then what the heck would those guys do if the guy beside them didn't shoot? I'll tell ya what would happen...they would be dead coming home in a casket. Our own leaders put us in deaths door for not backing up our men in Benghazi and you can thank Hillary for that. If you haven't watched it....you better .  If you don't want to be in the military to defend...stay home and let the other men fight. I'm not trying to be ugly, but I want the men and women who are out there putting their lives on the line to keep us free from things like 9-11 to have all the help they need at a moments notice.",1487289600,3,1004,3.9950248756218905
8360209,5,B002AS45TC,"Excellent movie.  I could relate to this morally.  Peace is always preferable to war.  How I wish we lived in a peaceful world without enemies too.
I could relate to all the viewpoints.  Made me wonder what I would do.",1485907200,,218,4.375
8360210,3,B002AS45TC,"I know war is hard on everyone. But, I don't believe that the statistics in this ""documentary"" are accurate. Yes, war is bad. No, no one likes killing another human being (terrorists an pedos excluded). But, to say that the majority of soldiers cannot shoot when contact is made, is so hard for me to wrap my head around. When you think about joining the military, the very first acceptance that you must make is, ""I may be shot at. I may be killed. I will have to shoot back. I will have to kill."" If you go in thinking ""maybe I can get through without having to fight"". You don't belong there. Someone is going to depend on you when it matters most. There can't be any hesitation. Maybe you can get through without ever needing to fight, and I am truly grateful when that is the case. But you can't hope for it going in.",1485820800,5,822,4.24203821656051
8360211,1,B002AS45TC,I was a scout sniper in mosul Iraq for a year 2004-2005 I seen things happen I did not like but war is a ugly thing. I was wounded lost 7 of my brothers so there was no way I was going to leave my brothers to fight alone sorry I had a sgt that refused to go he trained us to go now he refuses to go with us sorry he is a coward. I didn't belive in the Iraq war but I know we did good for the people of Iraq too. I fought for the man next too me.,1485216000,,445,3.372549019607843
8360212,1,B002AS45TC,"Typical leftwing story telling. Yes war is hell but, until we find a way to keep other people from imposing their will on us there will always be a need for rough men ready to do violence so that others can sleep peacefully in their beds. The military has been all volunteer for years now and, while I'll agree that the kids going in need to know what they are in for, they should get a balanced view. If you've had to kill you instantly become marginalized if you don't walk around crying, mea culpa.",1485043200,,501,4.28421052631579
