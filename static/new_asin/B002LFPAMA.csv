8372614,5,B002LFPAMA,"Paul Naschy is known by horror buffs as the Spanish Lon Chaney. The man's work, while artistically and critically varied, have cemented him in the annals of horror. Although his fame never caught on in the States; across the Atlantic he's revered and is a staple of midnight movies and B-fans such as myself. This movie, ""Hunchback of the Morgue"" is one if not the best film he's ever made. It's one of his best due to the higher budget effects (that being still B+ but an A+ for effort), tighter story line, and a surprisingly noble part marked by severe pathos of his tragic character. In this movie he is both sensitive and a ruthless creature. The plot is cheesy; however it is a well made movie for what it's worth. Paul Naschy may be remembered simply as El Hombre Lobo or Waldemar Daninsky but this movie is a hidden gem of the hidden gem of horror.",1384387200,4,856,4.424050632911392
8372615,5,B002LFPAMA,"The 1970s delivered some spectacular horror films.  Spanish horror was particularly good during these years.  These films are still known for their macabre atmosphere and stories, and this particular film is among the best of them.  The atmosphere, set pieces, gore, directing, and story are all well done. The quality on the DVD isn't up to the standards of the Naschy films from BCI Deimos.  However, this is the best quality of the film that I've seen so far.  Naschy plays a hunchback who supplies body parts to a mad doctor because the doctor says he'll reanimate his dead lover.  However, he's just using him so he can create a premortal monster.  He has a tank filled with organs and a head, and he puts the tank behind a closed door.  Apparently, the creature forms and it starts going nuts so he must continue to feed it.  You only see the creature at the very end; it's supposed to be a slimy monster from premortal times. The story is strange and the film has some graphic gore, and the underground crypt is creepy and well done.  The film would've been better if that creature had more screen time, but this is still one of Naschy's best films. The film takes place basically around an old-fashioned town and the surrounding rural area that consists of stuff like the morgue and that stone gothic underground crypt where the mad doctor conducts his experiment. I thought the film moves at a brisk pace, and there's nothing in between the exploitation that I would consider to be filler; however, it's not an action-packed horror flick. The film concentrates heavily on gothic atmosphere and scenery, and there's character development. There's only a brief flash of topless nudity during a sex scene, so it doesn't deliver in that area. The soundtracks are also old-fashioned, and the film isn't overloaded with gore from beginning to end; although it's gruesome at times. I should mention that there's a scene with real rats being burned alive, but I've seen a lot worse in other films. This is a very gothic, old-fashioned looking exploitation flick with stone structures and great atmosphere and scenery. Don't expect loads of action, and it doesn't look or feel modern.

The quality looks a little worn out, but it's so much better than a Japanese subtitled VHS bootleg that I saw. The quality isn't pristine, but I'm glad it's on DVD. The disc also has plenty of extras. I would recommend watching the movie in its original Spanish dialogue with the English subtitles.",1323648000,6,2484,4.780373831775701
8372616,4,B002LFPAMA,"Spanish Horror Film star Paul Naschy aka Jacinto Molina said in many interviews that he was a great fan of the old Hollywood Universal monster forays of the thirties and forties and this film, 'THE HUNCHBACK OF THE MORGUE' has hommages not only to those but to the low budget mad scientist flicks of the forties and fifties.  Naschy plays Gotho , a hunchback in the Dwight Frye vain who supplies the Dr. Frankenstein character here named Dr. Orla and nicely played by Jess Franco actor Alberto Dalbes with fresh bodies for his ultimate creation: the monster in the closet which resembles Joseph Green's cult classic 'THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE'.  It also has another Jess Franco stalwart Rosanna Yanni playing a psychiatrist and has a kinky nude scene with our hunchback which puts the term humping into a new orbit.  Its directed by Javier Aguirre who also directed Naschy and Yanni in one of my favorite horror opus's 'COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE' and contains some extremely gory set pieces.  Dalbes seems to come from the George Zucco/Lionel Atwill school of scientists constantly spewing speeches of creating the perfect being which dates back to the time of the Necromomicon?! and is perfectly over the top.  Naschy who also wrote the script is adequate as the lovesick handicapped slave.  Mya Communication releases a nice 1.85 transfer with optional English/Spanish/Italian subtitles , an alternate scene between Yanni and Naschy , trailers, and poster and still galleries.  Not one of Naschy's best , but a must for his fans and Euro Exploitation buffs.",1299369600,5,1562,4.984615384615385
8372617,3,B002LFPAMA,"I must agree with the Reviewer above me (Grypton)

 Very poor transfer,perfectly watchable though,but should have been much better.

 There is no excuse for Artifacts and Bad compression on a 2011 release.

But as a Paul Nashy fan I had to have it.",1298505600,4,248,4.674418604651163
