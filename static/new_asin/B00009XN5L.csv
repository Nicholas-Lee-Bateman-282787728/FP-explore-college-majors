The quality is good and the stories are excellent for beginning family discussions. It's also convenient that they are short (30 minutes) in case time is an issue. I would highly recommend all of the Storykeepers DVDs!",1231459200,,359,4.806451612903226
7994116,5,B00009XN5L,"These are wonderful movies.  I purchased the entire set for my children, and they love them.  I've also used Them very successfully with Sunday School and Children's Church. They keep the kids' attention with their action-packed adventure, educate children in the stories of Jesus, and at only 30 minutes each still leave time for a craft and coloring picture.  They are a nice New Testament compliment to the Veggie Tales series, which focus mainly on Old Testament events and people.  I actually prefer them to the Veggie Tale movies that I have seen, because in the story keepers' videos, while the main characters are fictitious, the stories that they tell of Jesus' life do not deviate from scripture.",1199577600,,706,4.9576271186440675
