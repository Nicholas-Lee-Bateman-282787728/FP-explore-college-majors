Then move into the general textbooks. Then read books by specialists in the field that each give their own view of the same subject.

Or you can skip all that and watch the Standard Deviance course on any particular subject. In this case it Standards Deviance Geometry.

Their humor is not that humorous. Its presented in a sort of soundbite form; however they do have some mystical way of making the most complex subjects so simple before your eyes that you wonder why you haven't learned it that way.

Tests are not my forte however the standard deviant tests are designed to help you retain the information needed for the next part of the course.

When you're finished everything you look at becomes lines, points, planes, angles etc.

Youll want to play this over several times even though you get it the first time.

I do have to admit that I knew geometry before I watched the DVD but for some reason it made it clearer by putting everything in order.",1482624000,,1102,4.485

7964937,5,B0000694W5,"I bought this for one of my nieces, but had to take a neat peak for myself. I took Plane Geometry myself in high school for the first time. I bought this because my niece was having problems at school with a teacher that has the attitude that - ""You should already know this!"" I said to myself: ""Well, if she should already know this, then what does she need you for - Ms Arrogant Teacher?""
I mean - after all - they do not teach Plane geometry in Grade School, do they?
Well, I know that my niece will love this---so much that I am going to buy another one for another one of my sisters' children...
Great DVD - played it on my laptop. I have not checked to see if it also plays on the TV or not. I mean, all kids have a TV in their room (just about) now a-days. Luv the DVD. Also, wanted to say -- that not every one has such a great teacher like I did at Winyah High School when I took Plane Geometry. My PG teacher was my second fave teacher in HS. Luv the DVD. Pass it on...",1363305600,,979,3.9

They break concepts down in a fun way. As a teacher, I recommend Standard Deviants to parents. My college freshman also found these videos helpful for reviewing.",1327622400,3,313,4.814814814814815
