8602233,3,B0013H9MPI,"For some reason ""Hip Hop 101"" led me to believe I would be learning basic steps and moves to mix into any routine while dancing to hip hop. Instead I learned one short routine from this dvd that I will never ""bust out with"" -- it was broken down clearly and easy to learn, but not what I was looking for while spending $17.99.  I'm going to look into an actual basic hip hop class.",1314748800,,381,4.08
8602234,5,B0013H9MPI,"I watch people at the clubs break dancing and getting into the center of dance circles. I've always wanted to get in there but never knew anything about hip hop (just six years tap and some modern). I thought that DVD's would be a bad way to go as I've always preferred the studio. But Kenny was great and it wasn't hard at all to get the same training.

I've jumped into the dance circles a few times now and everyone has cheered for me by the end. It's a lot more energetic and fun than modern. I just hope that Kenny does another more advanced DVD soon.

If you want to dance Hip Hop, I highly recommend this!",1307577600,,612,4.1344537815126055
8602235,5,B0013H9MPI,"My girl and I wanted to learn hip-hop together, but a class was so expensive and time consuming. Hip-hop 101 allowed us to learn at our own pace, without the pressure of looking amateur in front of a class.

I love it!",1206403200,,218,4.190476190476191
