1080584,5,6305832412,and just had to have it for my dvd collection. It is wonderfully made and tells the story in a good light.,1171065600,2,106,3.8636363636363638
1080585,5,6305832412,"I watched this outstanding Disney made-for-tv movie many, many times, and I LOVE it!!

 I first saw when it premiered on TV on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" show in the spring of 1998. At that time I taped it on a VHS tape off of TV, and I loved it so much that I watched it over and over many, many times.

  I should have broken the security tab on the tape, but because there were still several hours of free space left on the tape (it was taped in EP/SLP mode) I thought I would wait until the tape was filled before breaking it.

  Unfortunately a couple of years later, I ended up accidentally taping over this great movie with something else, thereby erasing it. I was so upset, and so I am VERY glad to FINALLY have this movie on DVD!!

  Since getting this terrific movie on DVD I have watched it so many times I have lost count!! I am also going to buy the soundtrack for it too, because the music is so moving and poignant.

  Miracle at Midnight is the touching made-for-TV movie based on true events during World War II. It is set in Denmark during September 1943,(the information in the Amazon.com Editorial Reviews is either a typo or other error)and stars Sam Waterston and Mia Farrow as Dr. Karl (Waterston) and Doris(Farrow) Koster, a Christian couple living in Copenhagen with their two children, 18 year old Hendrik (Justin Whalin) and preteen Elsa (Nicola Mycroft) during the Nazi occupation of Denmark.

  When Dr. Koster learns that after three years of occupation, the Nazis are going to start deporting the Jewish people in Denmark, he and his family realize that they can no longer sit by and watch their friends, neighbors and countrymen, be taken, and dragged away to Nazi concentration camps and death camps. They decide to do whatever they can to help those in danger.

  While Dr. Koster uses his position of Chief Surgeon to protect a young Resistance fighter who was shot by the Nazis, his 18 year old son Hendrik risks his life working for the same Resistance group, commandeering and seizing shipments of weapons that were sent to the Nazis.

  But it all comes to a head on Wednesday, September 29, 1943, when Dr. Koster gets word that the Nazis have planned a mass arrest and deportation of all Jewish people, at Midnight on that Friday, which is the start of the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah.

  Dr. Koster, his family, and his entire hospital staff, band  together with the Resistance, and the Danish people,

realizing that they are going to have to work really fast if they want to save the thousands and thousands of innocent Jewish people in Denmark from being dragged off to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp by the Nazis.

  They set up plans to find hiding places for the Jewish people, and get them safely through the initial raids, while they try to convince the Swedish government, to accept them, and find ways to transport them up the Danish coast to Sweden. As a majority of the Danes hate the Nazis, they are all willing to help, opening their homes, providing money and transportation.

  While Hendrik works with the Resistance, securing trucks and other means to take Jewish people up the coast of Denmark to Sweden, his father, Dr. Karl Koster uses his position as Chief Surgeon at Christiana Hospital to hide Jews in the hospital, and his mother, Doris, and sister, Elsa, help out by letting their Jewish friends, Rabbi Ben Abrams, his wife, his daughter Hannah, and her fiance Michael hide in their attic.

  Eventually the Nazis catch up to them, and the Kosters themselves are forced to flee for their lives. But before escaping, they are, in a matter of a couple of days, able to help save over 7,000 Danish Jews, in a miraculous rescue!

  Miracle at Midnight is a TERRIFIC movie! It is just WONDERFUL having it on DVD! Now I can enjoy it for years to come!!",1118707200,184,3823,4.597633136094674
1080586,4,6305832412,"This was a very captivating movie.
A Danish family becomes involved in helping Jews.  The son (Henrik) is in the resistance and keeps it a secret from his family, sure they would forbid him to continue because of the danger.
The father, a doctor, decides he must do what he can to help the Jews when he hears of the news of the Germans coming to route out and kill Jews.  He hides a family (friends of theirs) in the attic.
There are many tense and action-packed scenes.  The acting is great.
I wish the people didn't feel they had to lie to save the Jews, though.  (Corrie Ten Boom is a good example of someone who hid Jews and told the truth, being put in a concentration camp herself.  What strong belief that is.)
There were also a couple of kisses (if you worry about that kind of thing), but nothing more than that.
Overall I give this movie a solid thumbs up and it is a striking example of the bravery of many people during the war.",1085011200,11,940,4.229050279329609
1080587,5,6305832412,Excellent!  This is a very true to life movie about what happened during world war II in Denmark.  It shows how people got involved and made a difference in the lives of many others.  It shows a rich history that the  Danish can be proud of in saving the Jews from concentration camps.  Unlike  Schindler's list this movie is appropriate for preteen children to watch.,961891200,17,368,4.584615384615384

1080705,5,6305832412,This is a GREAT companion to the book Number the Stars by Lois Lowry.  The FICTIONAL stories are different but both are based on the FACTUAL story of the Jews escaping the Nazis in 1943.  It is an amazing event in our history!,1485388800,,226,4.232558139534884

1080708,5,6305832412,"I have always been fascinated by the role of Denmark's people during World War II, (how a country fought together for the common right to live and for decency).  Lois Lowry's Number the Stars is one of my favorite books.  Miracle at Midnight was a beautiful portrayal of courage based on true events.  Relating the tale of a Danish doctor, his family and many courageous people, this movie shows the fight by ordinary men, women and young people who made amazing sacrifices to save the lives of their neighbors.
The acting is superb, and I appreciated that even some of the German characters were humanly portrayed.  I thoroughly recommend this movie of heroism and sacrifice.  God bless you all.",1479686400,4,696,4.815126050420168

1080763,5,6305832412,"First of all, I loved this movie! We used this at school to end our Number the Stars unit. The kids liked it, and it tied in fairly well with events in the book. I would like to point out that there is a scene where a shopkeeper has hung himself, and while you only see a shadow, it still could be disturbing to some students. There are also quite a few scenes with guns and shooting, however the scenes were not gory or overly violent (as non-violent as guns can be, I guess I would say). I was comfortable showing this to my middle school resource students AFTER we discussed some of the heavier subjects and their historical significance.",1466985600,5,641,4.35

1080765,4,6305832412,"Watched this with my 11 year old son, at his request.  I liked it more than he did, but I think it's the older style of the movie that made it slow for him.  That being said, it was a great story and we both enjoyed it.",1465084800,,219,3.6382978723404253
1080766,4,6305832412,"This movie is made for TV but doesn't seem like it.  It tells the true story of how the Danes helped as many Jews as possible to escape the Nazi regime during WWII.  The kindness and generosity of the Danes shows true heroism.  So the film had a great topic, and the story was beautifully told.  Mia Farrow and Sam Waterston were excellent, but reason it is not a 5 star film is that the cinematography (such as, lighting, score, etc.) was not quite 5 up to star caliber.  Plus, the surrounding characters in the film (other than the Nazi's who were quite credible) were adequate but again, not 5 star quality.  Overall, yes, this was an outstanding movie!  A must see for high schoolers, though I would not have shown it to 5th graders as one other reviewer had done (and not surprisingly found out that the movie was too mature for them).",1464825600,,840,4.415584415584416
1080767,5,6305832412,This movie was great for my students to watch after reading Number the Stars. Depicted a time in our history that was dark but had rays of hope in sunshine in humanity,1464220800,,167,4.25
1080768,5,6305832412,I  teach Special Education Resource Students and we rad NUMBER THE STARS and this movie went very well with the book. It didn't have the gross violence of a Schindler's List that I have used with regular students but had enough suspense and such to keep theem interested and engaged in the learning process,1461024000,,306,4.666666666666667

1080770,5,6305832412,"Excellent! A true story of bravery. It was 1943, World War II in Denmark. Nazi occupied madness began as a military presence, escalating to a criminal attempt to arrest 1000's of Jewish people for solely religious reasons. Dr. George Hubner (his real name) found out a plan was to take place on Rosh Hashanah in 2 days. His quick response was to help 7,000 Jewish people escape via boats to Sweden, who agreed to take them in.
When the Danes returned several years later, their neighbors had watched over each others' houses, gardens etc. Why? ""Because it was the right thing to do.""
A war severely tests the people on all sides. This story illustrates that yes, we have choices to make.",1459036800,,687,4.639344262295082

Things I liked about this movie:

* acting
* emotional, touching
* suspenseful
* balance of drama and action
* did a very good job of capturing the moment
* sets and costumes

It is not rated, but if it were, I imagine it might be rated PG.  It's a quality movie released by Walt Disney Studios.  I look forward to watching it again.

1081048,3,6305832412,"Until they make a book fairly close to number the stars this is the best to get that is similar to the story.  One thing that irked me is how the film reinforces the stereotype that women are selfish.  In the book, mama (Inge) only thinks of saving the Jewish Danes and her friend because this is what Danish people do.  There is a true sense of partnership and equality of man and woman and that they have something bigger than just me, me, me, mine, mine,  mine.  In the movie, there are the interminable scenes where the mother goes on and on with the selfishness.  The movie seems to climax with the achievement of Mama's desire to help the Jewish Danes.  The book assumes this and is inspirational because of it.  One thing I liked about the film is that it gives a plausible explanation as to why the Nazi official warned the Jewish people that the NAZIs were coming.",1406160000,,873,4.37888198757764

I did this for several years in my fourth grade class, and the children were greatly impacted by the inspiring story of how the Danish people put themselves at risk to help their Jewish neighbors during a time of crisis.

Numerous movies have brought these events to life, particularly about WW2. Unlike the blockbuster films that have so many factual errors, there are incredible movies that tell of the brave men and women, civilians mostly, who risked everything to save lives. ""Miracle at Midnight"" is one such film - a remarkable true story of courage and sacrifice by a well-to-do Dutch family. Plenty of drama and heroics for men, and heartfelt, teary moments for women. This is the type of movie that should be shown in our schools! It is hard to see the horrible things that evil people did to their fellow humans, but the compassion and goodness of others is so amazing. Excellent for teens and mature pre-teens. (there is nothing graphic or scary, but the subject matter may be difficult for younger children to understand) This is a must see movie - watch it with friends for an uplifting evening!",1335312000,,1010,4.711864406779661

Hot Toasty Rag, October 22, 2017

In Denmark during the thick of WWII, Benedick Blythe wants to impress Hitler by suddenly rounding up all the Jews in his district, even though the Nazi occupation has left the townspeople alone for three years. He gets the bright idea of arresting everyone in a surprise attack on Rosh Hashanah, but Patrick Malahide, a sympathetic Nazi, warns those in danger. With only a few days notice, everyone pulls together to hide their friends and smuggle them to safety in Sweden.

While this is a Disney tv movie, its actually pretty exciting! Sam Waterston takes the lead, since hes a doctor and can hide hundreds of people in his hospital. His wife, Mia Farrow, is reluctant to help at first because she fears for her childrens safety, but she quickly gets on board and helps out. Both Sam and Mia, who have previously been in four films together, have a comfortable and caring chemistry, and they both give great tension-filled performances.

Miracle at Midnight is a wonderful true story thats inspiring and heartfelt. Director Ken Cameron doesnt make it feel like a typical tv movie, and those who particularly like WWII-set films will enjoy learning about this little-known story. Even audiences who don't normally like these types of movies because of the gruesomeness might make an exception for this one. Its completely family friendly and could even be shown in schools. With great acting and some very smart suspenseful scenes, this is a great movie to pop in after dinner on a school night.",1508630400,,1561,4.8830188679245285

7895732,5,6305832412,"Wonderful, moving drama about the Danish secretly evacuating 90% of the Jewish population during the German occupation.  This movie pairs beautifully with Lois Lowry's book, Number the Stars.  Setting is the same, characters are similarly named, the plot is similar.  Students will be able to make great comparisons...and contrasts.  Remember to build background knowledge on the Holocaust before showing the movie, or reading the book.  Great for 5th grade and up.",1500508800,,465,5.492957746478873
