1059628,3,6305701245,"""The High Sign"" is the gem herein.  It's a delightful romp wherein Keaton's character is introduced thusly: ""Our hero came from Nowhere---he wasn't going Anywhere and got kicked off Somewhere.""  It's a 20 minute short that was Keaton's second solo effort in this category; one moreover which he co-wrote & co-directed (unlike ""Saphead"" in which he had no similar imput).  Ultimately he gets hired to be a wealthy man's bodyguard right before being roped into joining a gang who gives him the task to kill that same wealthy individual as his initiation rite.  A cut-a-way view of a house is the set for the mile-a-minute frenzied finale herein; as Keaton flies through windows, doors, and trap doors trying to resolve the above predicament into which he stumbled.  It's Keaton at his best.  Do make it a point to see this short.  I wouldn't suggest you buy this disc, however, as the 78 minute feature is not really even a 'Keaton film' & is not something even Buster fans will want to watch multiple times.  So, borrow this disc if you can & save your money for discs that include some of Keaton's greats instead: ""The General,"" ""Sherlock Jr.,"" and/or ""The Cameraman.""  Cheers!",1143331200,,1177,4.787128712871287
1059629,3,6305701245,"THE SAPHEAD is a rather dull romantic comedy.  I'm guessing that if it didn't have Buster Keaton in the title role, this film wouldn't have seen a DVD release for another twenty years.  From a historical viewpoint, I suppose we must be grateful to the film, as it established Keaton as a bankable star, thus enabling him to go to bigger and better things.  But judging the film on its own merits, I can only say that I was completely bored by it.
The movie has a few major flaws.  The most annoying is the fact that Keaton (although the star) doesn't have enough screen time, and the other characters are one-dimensional and simply not interesting.  The script is adapted from a play by the name of THE NEW HENRIETTA, and I can only hope that the material was funnier on the stage, because it certainly didn't translate well to the screen.  The story takes too long to set itself up, the plot isn't terribly inspired, and, worst of all, most of the jokes aren't all that funny.  Keaton does his best with what he has to work with, but, truthfully, there isn't much to this.  He livens things up a bit on a handful of occasions, but for the most part, he is overwhelmed by the leaden script.
Also included on the DVD are two short movies.  Unlike the main feature, these two were co-written and co-directed by Buster Keaton himself.  The difference couldn't be any more staggering.  Give the man some creative control, and he turns out material a thousand times better.  While the main feature is slow, ponderous and dull, these two shorts are fast-paced and hilarious.
The first short film is THE HIGH SIGN.  By cheating his way through at a shooting gallery, Buster finds himself employed as both a bodyguard and a hit man.  The movie culminates in a large house with multiple revolving walls and trapdoors.  Buster and company leap through them with reckless abandon.  I'm quite torn by watching this.  Part of me wants to admire the craftsmanship and the effort that went into designing the physical gags and the intricate set.  The other part of me just wants to be engulfed by the sheer entertainment.
The second short on the disc, ONE WEEK, starts with a fun gag involving Buster Keaton and his new bride attempting to exit one car and enter another -- while both automobiles are still moving.  In any case, the newlyweds have been given a house as a wedding-gift.  But there's one catch.  The ""house"" is a kit, a do-it-yourself construction job.  Thanks to some sabotage from the wife's ex, Buster builds himself a bizarre structure, with several features not found in ordinary homes.  Anyone who knows anything about Buster Keaton's style of comedy should salivate at the thought of his baffled but determined character given over to that premise.  And the result here is wonderful.  The production crew built a giant house prop worthy of Keaton's comedy, and there's a fun gag that involves the moving of an unwieldy piano that rivals the problems that beset Laurel and Hardy in their Oscar-winning short film THE MUSIC BOX.
The picture quality is quite good considering that the material is over eighty years old.  The DVD cover claims that the soundtracks are a modern recreation of the original scores, and while I can't independently verify that, it seems appropriate enough.  I'm hesitant as to whether I should really recommend this DVD given that I was so utterly bored by the main feature.  The two extras (of about twenty minutes each) are worthy of purchase though.  Perhaps I should say that this disc will mainly be of interest to Buster Keaton fans.  People looking for a solid introduction to the man's work should probably choose one of the other entries in the Art Of Buster Keaton DVD series.",1074384000,3,3718,4.692901234567901
1059630,4,6305701245,"The Saphead is an underrated film. Many Keaton fans consider it to be one of his worst silent features. It is true that it lacks the comic ingenuity of his later films and does not, on the whole, show the athletic Buster flinging himself about performing ever more mind-boggling stunts. Nevertheless, The Saphead is an extremely funny film. The comedy depends not so much on various gags, but on the story and the way that Keaton looks and acts. This makes it an unusual Keaton film. It is partly because of the fact that The Saphead is unlike Buster's other films, that I found it so interesting. Although he is the main character of the film, he is part of an ensemble cast and thus there is the chance to see Keaton's interaction with other fully developed characters. This interaction is often hilarious. Buster's persona, in this film, is fully developed and his character is similar to that which appears in films like The Navigator and Battling Butler. In the Saphead, Keaton shows just how expressive his stoneface could be. The incredible thing about this film is that Buster can be so funny when he does nothing. Even when he stands still and just looks, I found myself laughing. It may be that The Saphead is not one of Keaton's very best films, but it is unusual and judged by its own standards works well. The tinted print used for this DVD is fairly good. There are times when it is a little dark and faded, but for the most part the images are clear.
This DVD also includes two of Keaton's best short films The High Sign and One Week. These films show a more familiar Keaton and have some incredible comic stunts. The High Sign also features a cameo from the wonderful Al St. John, familiar from Buster's films with Roscoe Arbuckle. These two films are surreal and weird. The High Sign has Buster getting involved with a bizarre secret society the Blinking Buzzards, while One Week shows Buster's disastrous attempt to build a house with faulty plans. The result is a house which Picasso might have designed. Both these films have very good black and white prints with very little apparent damage.",991353600,2,2112,4.634666666666667
1059631,5,6305701245,"This collection contains the first 3 films Buster made following the filmmaking apprenticeship he experienced under Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle from 1917-19. After seeing the dissatisfying results of ""The High Sign"", he was hired to do ""The Saphead"" while thinking up a better idea for his 2-reeler debut, which eventually came to be ""One Week"".
THE SAPHEAD (1920): ""The Saphead"" is based on the play ""The Henrietta"", which had been a hit on Broadway and starred Douglas Fairbanks in the role of Bertie ""the Lamb"" Van Alstyne. Fairbanks had recommended Buster for the role in this filmed version, retitled ""The Saphead"".
Buster's role doesn't start until about 10 minutes into the movie, where we see him wolfing down a big meal and being overly pampered by valets and servants. Bertie the Lamb is the son of a wealthy man who thinks his son is spoiled and soft. Because Bertie has read a book that states that the modern girl is more interested in a dangerous guy than a safe guy, he goes to a gambling parlor and then tries to get himself arrested. In this scene, fans of Buster's are given a rare treat: He opens his mouth and shows his teeth, which almost develops into a full smile! What a cutie!!
""The Saphead"" is actually a drama that's peppered with the subjects of infidelity, illegitimate children, death, suicide, and financial ruin. The only comedic moments in the film are supplied by Buster, who is allowed to practice his trademark pratfalls in a few scenes, which help illustrate the depth of his inept character, the Lamb. But because of his role, the film is worth watching simply because he's in it.
THE HIGH SIGN (1920): ""The High Sign"", a 2-reeler that was shelved after its completion in January 1920, was actually released to the public after Buster had an unforeseen accident that derailed his filmmaking schedule, thus leaving him without a release to fulfill his contract obligations in April 1921. Buster intended ""The High Sign"" to be his 2-reel debut under his new contract, but was unsatisfied with the results, believing that his debut should have stronger material. ""The High Sign"" features him as a shooting gallery employee who is forced into the role of ""button man"" for a group of low-rent gangsters, who use a ""high sign"" for a password. Although ""The High Sign"" wasn't up to Buster's standards, it's as good as most of the 2-reelers he made in the future, and I think it deserved a better reason to be released than as an alternative because of the consequences caused by a broken foot.
ONE WEEK (1920): ""One Week"" is the second 2-reeler Buster made, which did pass his quality control inspection. It's also, to this day, one of his most popular 2-reelers, so he was correct in releasing it first. ""One Week"" is about newlyweds who are gifted with a house-building kit. Not knowing that the jealous former suiter of his bride has sabotaged the construction directions, they build what turns out to be a cockeyed house (and throughout the film, they don't seem to notice that anything is wrong with it). The gags center around this dysfunctional building until the end, when we get to see one of the most famous scenes of Buster's career (involving a train).",972259200,10,3191,4.782608695652174
1059632,3,6305701245,"Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of Keaton's work.  This is why it pains me to  say that ""The Saphead"" is weak, and not just by Keaton's  standards.  As much as I love this man - skip this film.  That said, I gave  this DVD three stars because of the short features which follow it.  ""The High Sign,"" described by one reviewer as ""a lark,""  is actually one of my favorites.  Filled with enough gags for any short  comedy, Keaton's acting is a pleasure and the plot is the sort of  comedy/conspiracy narrative G. K. Chesterton might have made if silent  films were his thing - I'm always reminded of ""The Man Who Was  Thursday.""  ""One Week"" is another wonderful short.  With the  famed, surreal hobby-kit house and a perfect ending, it is another must see  Keaton short.
So here's the problem: is it worth getting The Saphead just  for the two shorts?  If you're a Keaton fan and want to fill out the  collection then go ahead, you won't regret it.  If you're not a big fan,  but like Keaton at his best, go for a DVD of more consistent quality - I  recommend the Our Hospitality/Sherlock Jr. double feature.",965865600,12,1102,4.373134328358209

The disc does have some nice Bonus Features, but not the shorts.  The movie quality is better, looks better, on the Blu-ray.

7892992,4,6305701245,"Prior to 1920, Buster Keaton was best known for his shorts with Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle. Both under contract with Joseph M. Schenck, Keaton's feature film debut was actually started by a recommendation by popular swashbuckling silent action star Douglas Fairbanks.

Fairbanks who starred in the film ""The Lamb"", a 1915 action silent film based on the play ""The New Henrietta"" by Victor Mapes and Winchell Smith was being remade.  And because of Keaton's popular physical comedy and the fact that the comedy remake which would be based on ""The New Henrietta"" and Bronson Howard's play ""The Henrietta"", Fairbanks recommended that Buster Keaton play the part.  And sure enough, Joseph M. Schenk gave his OK for Keaton to be loaned out and headline his first feature-film, ""The Saphead"" would create recognition for Buster Keaton acting and physical comedy but also giving him the chance to show that he can be a headliner .

While ""The Saphead"" was Keaton's first film, he would go on to create primarily shorts for the next three years until 1923 in which he would star and co-direct the films ""Our Hospitality"" and ""Three Ages"".  Considered as ""the big start"" in Keaton's film career, the film continues to entertain Buster Keaton fans and now, ""The Saphead"" will be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.

The Blu-ray release will feature the original film featuring music by Robert Israel plus a complete alternate version.  The alternate version featuring the same story, but featuring variant takes and different camera angles.  So, same story but different takes, so essentially a different film.  This alternative version would feature a 2.0 stereo solo piano score by Ben Model.

VIDEO:

""The Saphead"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is color-tinted.  The good news is that fortunately ""The Saphead"" was restored and taken care of by film collector and archivist Raymond Rohauer.  As for the film itself, I have watched the original Kino DVD many times (via ""The Art of Buster Keaton DVD Box Set).  And so I was anticipating the film to look great on Blur-ay as previous Buster Keaton films have been on Blu-ray.

But for anyone who has not seen a silent film on Blu-ray from Kino Lorber, it's important to note that Kino is not a company that spends a lot of money and dedicates many hours into restoration and clean-up.  So, with that being said, don't expect the film to look pristine.  Especially since it is over 92-years-old.  You will see scratches, white specks but fortunately, this film was restored earlier on before any nitrate damage could have made the film unwatchable or terrible looking.

The film looks good on Blu-ray with black levels looking good, whites and grays that are well-contrast but could it look better, definitely. Could it look even clear?  Of course.  But the reality is that restoration is expensive and not many companies can afford to continually do it for each release.  Yes, Raymond Rohauer did restore the film but restoring films a decade ago or many decades ago can not compare to how films are restored today with newer and costly technology.

With that being said, ""The Saphead"" looks very good and no blurring or faint details as seen on the original DVD release.  I'm sure Keaton fans will definitely appreciate the video quality on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

For the release of ""The Saphead"", the original film features music by Robert Israel presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and in 2.0 Stereo.  For the alternate version, Ben Model's solo piano score is presented in 2.0 stereo.

I will say that hearing Israel's music via lossless was amazing.  I was testing the music back and forth from 5.1 to 2.0 and the overall music came alive in lossless.  So, I do appreciate the lossless Robert Israel soundtrack being included on Blu-ray.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Saphead"" comes with the following special features:

  Complete Alternate Version of ""The Saphead"" - The alternate version is the same story with variant takes and camera angles.
  ""A Pair of Sapheads"" - (7:31) A featurette comparing the two versions of the film and why an alternate version was made.
  ""Buster Keaton: Life of the Party"" - (30:34) A fascinating audio recording fro 1962 as Buster Keaton recalls memories of his youth and the songs of the past.
  Why They Call Him Buster - (1:11) The ""Lost Keaton"" promotional trailer.
  Gallery - Featuring a gallery of 16 images showcasing work from Buster Keaton's career.

EXTRAS:

""The Saphead"" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Saphead"" may not be the best film in Buster Keaton's oeuvre, but what a delightful and fun film.  I never grow tried of watching it!

Having seen this film multiple times, it was great to finally watch it on Blu-ray and also getting the opportunity to watch the alternative version included.  But historically, ""The Saphead"" was a major film in Buster Keaton's career as actor in Hollywood and Douglas Fairbanks really gave Keaton a major chance of being a movie star.  While there are many shorts featuring Buster Keaton before and after ""The Saphead"" was released, it was the first film that would have a farther reach around the glove, but also would feature Keaton in his trademark, deadpan face.  But also a chance to see him his physical comedy in action.

I enjoyed the film because of two things.  One would be the film's time capsule of capturing the feel of New York's Stock Exchange.  We see early footage of how packed ""The Street"" (Wall Street) was during 1920 but it also gives us a look at how investments were made in the Stock Exchange.  And I always gravitate towards films that are time capsules of the past.

Also, I always found the film to be intriguing in how a man would try to be a ""bad boy"" in order to get a woman back then.  It has its relevance today in the fact that many men try to read books on how to be a bad boy and date more women, so what the character of Bertie is no difference to how guys are today.  Many single men are still reading ""How to"" pick up women type of books and as long as these men have difficulties, many will be like Bertie and end up doing stupid things in order to attract women.

But while ""The Saphead"" may not be a Keaton written or directed film, it's a film that captures comedy, as Bertie is literally clueless.  May it come to gambling or being part of the Stock Exchange, he has no clue but the way he goes about it, we can't help but laugh.

In one scene, the men at the Stock Exchange go through their newbie ritual of hitting his hat or dropping his walking stick and just having fun with Bertie.  And for Bertie, he doesn't see these men as mocking him but his naivety lets him believe that this is the culture among men working at the Stock Exchange.

At 77 minutes long, ""The Saphead"" is a shorter feature film but fortunately with this Blu-ray release, you get the film in HD, you get an alternative version of the film (same story but slightly acted differently by the talent) plus special features including a half hour rare audio recording from 1962 as Keaton recalls memories and songs of his youth.

Overall, ""The Saphead"" is going to continue to entertain old and new Buster Keaton fans. And one should not come to this film thinking it to be on the same level as ""The General"" or ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."".  It's primarily Keaton's first feature film but if anything, the film is delightful and funny and as a silent film fan, I love silent comedies and enjoy the work of Buster Keaton.  The film succeeds because of Keaton, the film is hilarious because of Keaton. Any other silent actor, I can't see anyone else pulling this film off.  He was perfect for the role!

Is it worth watching?  Definitely.  Is it worth buying?  If you have purchased many Buster Keaton films on Blu-ray thus far, then ""The Saphead"" is another feature film starring Buster Keaton that is worth having in your silent cinema collection.",1352332800,,7920,4.720845481049563
7892993,5,6305701245,"The new Blu-ray disc (and re-issue DVD) from Kino Classics presents TWO DIFFERENT versions of THE SAPHEAD, derived from two different camera negatives.
I prefer watching the ""Alternate"" version, it is way better in the second half with better interior details.

The first version is the standard ""Rohauer"" version with his re-issues titles and film tinting. The ""Alternate"" version (accessible from the extras menu) presents what is believed to be the foreign camera negative version that would have been sent to other countries to have the 1-frame dialogue cards translated (Kino inserted the Rohauer dialogue cards that are long enough to read).

The ""Rohauer"" version has new Rohauer titles and a brief history of the story on stage before the movie starts. The ""Alternate"" version recreates what the original title card might have looked like. Unfortunately the original title cards have not survived over time.

The ""Rohauer"" version is 2 minutes longer than the ""Alternate"" version, but this discrepancy, demonstrated in a brief bonus documentary, is due to slightly shorter cuts of some scenes. Nothing major is missing.

The ""Rohauer"" version may look sharper at first, but you will notice much more detail in the dark areas of the ""Alternate Version"". The wedding scene is particularly dark around the edges, Kino tried to compensate for the edge darkness by raising the black levels on the edges, but this does not restore the details, It just gives a weird halo effect that looks unnatural.  The ""Alternate"" version has all details and a smooth grey-tone.

The ""Rohauer"" version tints all scenes various colors (muted somewhat on this new re-release) while the ""Alternate"" version only tints the night scenes blue. Which version is correct is unknown as the tinting continuity log is lost.  The negative of the ""Alternate"" version had all of the night scenes mounted on one reel for tinting while all other scenes were edited together. This hints that only the night scenes were originally tinted.

The bonus documentary ""A PAIR OF SAPHEADS"" compares selected scenes from the two versions, showing how the camera placement differs. Sometimes one version has tighter framing, other times it is the other version with tighter framing.  It is obvious that two different negatives, filmed at the same time, survive.

Comparing this new Blu-ray to the old ""Art of Buster Keaton"" DVD (which only contains the ""Rohauer"" version) shows an overall sharper, stable image. The old DVD was not bad, this is just a little better. The tints on the old DVD are much more brighter, this new Blu-ray tones them down to a more natural look.

Aside form the above mentioned bonus, there is also an audio recording from May 5th 1962 of Buster Keaton at a private intimate party. The amateur recording is primitive and often hard to hear as the microphone is too far away, so turn up the volume. This peak into his off-screen world shows his joy in social parties.

There is also a collection of stills from the movie.

A miss-named, miss-leading bonus item called ""Why They Call Him Buster"" would lead you to believe this is a documentary about Buster starting out in show business. But NO this is only a promo for Kino's LOST KEATON DVD & Blu-ray release.  Shameful!  Why didn't they just call this a promo.

I am sorry there is no audio commentary, I especially like to listen to them on silent movies. They often help you understand out-dated jokes or forgotten cameos.

As far as the movie goes, this is Buster's first feature film. Since the original title card is lost we don't know if he got star billing in the title, but in the cast credits he is last.
While not his best work, Buster is still enjoyable here and this is a 'must-have' for his fans. Buster is the 'comedy hero' in this otherwise dramatic film.
If you are just getting to know Buster, i direct you to his classics like ""The General""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-General-Blu-ray/dp/B002NTDX6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The General [Blu-ray</a>] and ""Sherlock Jr.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Jr-Three-Ages-Blu-ray/dp/B0041CGOZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Jr. / Three Ages [Blu-ray</a>].",1340841600,9,4260,5.268833087149187

7892995,5,6305701245,"This DVD contains one feature and two shorts from Keaton's earliest work as an independent filmmaker after he ceased his three year partnership with Roscoe Arbuckle in 1920 after Arbuckle left the Comique company to sign with Paramount.

""The Saphead"" does not showcase Keaton the filmmaker, but rather Keaton the actor. The script is from a play, the directors are individuals Keaton never worked with before or hence, and the studio was Metro, predecessor of MGM. Keaton plays Bertie the Lamb, mild-mannered and spoiled son of Nick Van Alstyne, ""the Wolf of Wall Street"". In spite of the fact that Keaton had no creative input to the film and isn't actually its centerpiece, there is much to like about this film and much that is so Keatonesque. Keaton plays an old-fashioned romantic and someone that is thrust into the role of the fall guy by the actual bad guy - a theme he repeats in his own features. He also has down pat the part of being the well-dressed dapper man of the 1920's, which he repeats with more comic effect in ""The Battling Butler"".

""The High Sign"" was Keaton's first two-reeler after he went solo in 1920, but it was not the first film he released. Here he plays a drifter who gets hired by a member of the gang ""The Blinking Blizzards"" to run a shooting gallery. In a turn of events that can happen only in a Keaton film, Buster winds up being hired to both kill the father of the girl he loves and also to protect him. The film ends with a funny chase sequence through a house that has a series of trick doors, false walls, and traps that could only be designed by the mind of Keaton.

Keaton disliked ""The High Sign"" and delayed its release. Instead, his premiere release was ""One Week"". Here Keaton is the groom in the story of a pair of newlyweds that receive a wedding gift of an assemble-it-yourself house. Unfortunately, the bride has a jilted suitor that wants revenge. He gets it by renumbering all of the containers of building supplies that come with the manufactured home. The result is a house that is incorrectly assembled to say the least. The roof doesn't fit, the kitchen sink is on the outside of the house, and the chimney is over the bathtub, among other faults.

I really like the score on all of the Kino Keaton DVDs, and the video, though not perfect, is better than anything you'll find in the public domain. The only bad thing I can say is that there are no extra features or commentary at all. In their earlier DVDs, of which this is one, it seems like Kino didn't really grasp the power of DVD to deliver extra features and just reissued the VHS tapes of many of their silents in DVD form with no upgrades.",1206144000,,2659,4.487603305785124
