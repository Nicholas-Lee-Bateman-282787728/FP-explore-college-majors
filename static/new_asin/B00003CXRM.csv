1302282,5,B00003CXRM,"We were absolutely mesmerized by this movie. Sure, we're Coen fans, but this transcended our expectations. Incredibly well written, acted and directed, visually glorious, and full of heart and soul (not to mention the sexiest scene put on film in years). Did I mention the music? Never mind those who, as another great Minnesotan said, criticize what they can't understand. Go experience joy. See this movie.",979430400,3,408,5.196969696969697
1302283,4,B00003CXRM,"Most of the unwashed masses won't like this movie.  The humour is intelligent and the movie is rife with literary references.  I found it to be a beautiful work of art.
The colours are muted so that the whole film looks like a sepia-toned photograph, the characters are wonderfully developed, and the script is great.  The bluegrass soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and adds a lot to the mood.
I've been recommending it to all my literary friends.",978566400,3,450,4.743589743589744

It is excellent in every aspect of production- writing, cinematography, music, acting, directing, etcetera. It all blends together perfectly with the humor and fun of the film, and throws in a bit of social commentary about the South of not too long ago. George Clooney and the entire cast play their parts like well-pomaded hair (they ""gel"" together nicely). This is a true gem of Ethan and Joel Coen.",1519257600,,555,4.673469387755102

1303517,5,B00003CXRM,"Hilariously funny movie that's meant to be taken as a parody based on a simpler, more innocent era in our nation's history. I thought that this movie was one of the most amusing takes on this slapstick era in deep south rural 1930's America that's ever been produced. As a Southerner myself I've seen firsthand many of the quaint and quirky idiosyncrasies largely intrinsic to this area and this era which the movie highlighted so delightfully. These characteristics caricatured in this film only enhance fond memories I have of my Southern roots and upbringing and those rebellious, hell-raising, whiskey lovin', largely unschooled and unrepentant male relatives (uncles) and many of their fellow small town and rural neighbors who added color, life and animation to our lives. For me, this movie was not a 'put down' of my part of the country at all but a reminder and a celebration of a people (black and white),a culture, a place and a time that I hold most dear looking back on my life. I think that Hollywood should be congratulated for bringing together this entertaining story-line, the fine acting talents and wonderful ole-time music this great film so graphically showcases.",1511308800,,1185,4.98989898989899

George Clooney is fine, but his co-stars John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, Holly Hunter and John Goodman are terrific too.  Undergirded by distinctive country/gospel music of the era, to the point where at times this flick resembles a musical.  (Can you imagine a Ku Klux Klan sequence directed by Busby Berkeley?)

1303783,2,B00003CXRM,"I'd heard of this, I guess but as it's said it is ""not among their best"" nor with the strong recommendation of others they made. Researching deeper into the Carter Family, this film was mentioned. With that, and thier name and reputation I hunted a copy and only then saw, George Clooney. An odd fit, for something other than an obvious romantic comedy. But this movie is always obvious, trivializes its subject matter and while there are surprises, there have to be. ""The Odyssey,"" oh brother.

It's great to treat deep or folkloric elements in a popular way, but this is a poor pastiche.

So loose is the overconfident barnstorming of the movie it is easy to link the ten-elbows to the ribs treatment of Robert Johnson's Missississippi Crossroads blues legend, as deep into his story as ""stovepipe hat"" in Lincoln's, with the national newspapers running candidate Clinton in a cartoon playing the legend for the primary vote in that state: not by hayseeds, but by the loose-with taste and principle people who lead campaigns for power and money as in the film. Selling soul for the primary (amid all the sexism of that year); those not finding that offensive would enjoy the cow-shooting and frog-smushing which are necessary, for the elite to burn off some of their superiority to the faceless hordes living in the South.

The movie is a would-be silly embarassment and a copout for the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" directors speaking in the Extras. It's offensive to everyone involved and to any audience with a soul. Letting Clooney in on a movie is one thing, but they feature him over everyone. Just a copout.",1506556800,,1608,4.79783393501805

1304428,5,B00003CXRM,"I like this movie from many angles.  First, the acting by Clooney, Turturro and Nelson is awesome.  John Goodman and Dehenney were so intense.  The story had many comparative scenes with Homer's Odyssey.  It set up the driven nature of the narrative.  The use of 1930's music and manner of speech set the tone and kept it from being a buddy movie.  The blind prophet, the sirens, the names like Ulysses and Menelaus were right from Homer.  Goodman with an attitude was really cyclopean.  It also helped that I have met David Holt, the string player celebrating the end of the Baby Face Nelson trial.",1496620800,,599,4.6380952380952385

1304950,4,B00003CXRM,"This is a hilarious movie even if it does have George Clooney in it and the story has a Hollywood twinge tweaking at country folk that falls into some stereotyping which is a bit annoying. Movie critics didn't like it for snobbish reasons in my opinion. Obviously the majority of people involved in making and acting in the movie have no real understanding of The South but it is after all a movie. I don't think Clooney has a clue how real people live and it does show through in his ""acting"" here as well as the two primary supporting cast actors. Nonetheless it is fast paced, funny and even if it is inconsistent and the dots don't always connect it is enjoyable and humorous. Enjoy it for what it is, a comedy. If they had left out the swearing it wouldn't have changed the movie and it would be more family friendly. A real plus was seeing The Whites, Ralph Stanley and The Cox Family. Actually the best thing that probably came out of this movie is the soundtrack and the concert which is a separate video by D A Pennebaker.",1489276800,,1031,4.375

1305271,1,B00003CXRM,"There is a lot of style to this Coen brothers film but a genuine lack of substance. I just couldn't get into the quirky, almost formulaic narrative of three guys on the run, they meet someone odd, they do something, the odd person is gone, cycle repeats, etc. Then throw in bizarre, explainable character behavior, such as the gangster inexplicably shooting cows, or John Goodman crushing a toad and slamming it into a tree. Not sure if this was intended to be funny, shocking, or just bizarre, but I guess I just didn't get what was going on. Throw in the odd yellow-ochre hue everywhere and the entire film has a surreal setting to it (that, and the endlessly-tedious 'A Prairie Home Companion' folk music. A little really goes a long way here.) Regarding the color, seems like there was a labor to remove green tones, which I don't understand (heck, even the cover to the video includes green, so what's up with that?) This effect makes you feel dry, tired and thirsty after awhile - plus it felt like there were certain spots in the film where the effect was missed on trees along the horizon. Was this intentional or just sloppy post-production editing?

The film also really paints an ugly picture of religion, namely Christianity, focusing a little to tightly on more obscure, cult-like fringes of Christianity that are far from a fair representation (I understand this is Hollywood, but all the same, the only mention of Christ Jesus is as an expletive.) Most every mainstream protestant denomination would teach that baptism is more involved than rushing into water and being dunked, that there is also required belief and repentance in Christ and subsequent discipleship. Instead the film shows the intellectually slower of the three characters rushing to be plunged, then returned to be mocked by Clooney's intellectually superior skeptical character. I get it, it's Hollywood, but all the same a better representation of faithful believers would have been appreciated.

I can't honestly say I'd watch this again. I've heard this film hyped for the visuals and frankly, I didn't get the big deal with the chromatic changes to extract green. Makes little sense if you're going to film so much of the beautiful landscape in the south to scrub out the green. Likewise the musical segments frequently made no sense. Who were the three women singing by the waterside? I thought it was a dream, but then it wasn't, but then one character leaves his clothing neatly behind, and.... I just didn't get it. Pass.",1485302400,,2513,4.869158878504673

1305471,4,B00003CXRM,"Three fugitives from a chain gang (George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson) undergo a series of adventures in a quest for treasure and the reconciliation of a failed marriage.

There many wonderful scenes in this film, which is bursting with terrific performances and great folk music from its Depression-era setting.  In some ways, it is similar to the classic Bonnie and Clyde in the way that it serves as a kind of travelogue through that poverty-stricken era.  However, O Brother emerges as something less than the sum of its parts, a series of episodic set pieces in which the characters encounter and reencounter each other in a chain of unlikely coincidences that consistently entertain, but don't really seem to amount to a satisfying whole.",1484352000,,761,5.023809523809524
1305472,5,B00003CXRM,"Albeit not as highbrow as the original Odyssey, this thoroughly enjoyable rural South prison escape, comedy adventure wears well with multiple viewings; its a keeper : )  The acting is well-done; many of the scenes are just plain fun; plus the bluegrass music is excellent.  One might want to also purchase the CD just because the music is that good.  Yes, the movie has some cursing and violence, but not exploitatively so.  Despite being made years ago, this movie retains its freshness, not becoming dated or wearisome.  At just over 100 minutes long, and PG-13 rated, this DVD is well-suited to a wide viewing audience, making it suitable as a gift or for institutional settings.

On the surface, it's a bizarre idea: a trio of of convicts escape from a chain gang and embark on an odyssey, literally inspired by Homer's ancient mythical tale. The twist? It's set in the American Great Depression-era 1930's, and works in just as many references to the culture and lore of that time as it does to Greek mythology. The soundtrack is unforgettable, working in blues, bluegrass, folk, and gospel. The blu-ray upgrade is definitely worth it. The HD remaster looks and sounds absolutely beautiful.

My eldest teen who hasn't watched it as much as the rest of us suddenly said, 'enjoy your picture show, boys.' and we all burst out laughing.  I'ts not a funny line in the movie, but it was funny that she knew that random line.  The movie is based on the Oddesy, which keeps it interesting  trying to identify characters from that book.  It is entertaining, very funny, and has great music.  Although there are parts of it which show racism due to the setting in the 1930's Mississippi, it's an important part of the movie, and the racists absolutely do not prevail.",1470787200,,724,4.398496240601504

1307836,1,B00003CXRM,"Movie itself is top notch. Deserves 6 stars. Blu ray transfer is the issue

First disc I purchased had major issues. You pause then play and the information window (which shows both movie time and movie state: i.e. paused, playing etc) would not go away and still showed movie as paused. Stopping the disc would not allow me to restart disc. Just wouldn't play again. Only way to get movie to play was to turn off blu ray player and restart movie from closes chapter.
I am using a Marantz blu ray player and checked to make sure firmware was up to date and it was.

I called Disney who agreed to exchange the disc out with a fresh new copy.

New copy arrives several weeks later and still exhibits the same issues.

My player has no other issues playing any other blu ray disc and I have many of them.

I can only assume the issue is specific to this transfer.

Sure, the cars and clothes are flawlessly accurate.  The camera work is top notch.  The action is lively.  But for me, all of this surface candy was wasted on a bland script.  There is not a single character to care about or even ponder once the credits roll.  The actors do their best, but rarely pass as remotely southern.  It would have been better to just speak with exactly the same vocal inflections as they do in real life and only then each do some version of a dumb guy from their home towns.",1465171200,,652,4.428571428571429

The movie was absolutely hilarious from start to finish.  The wacky characters, and the bizarre situations that the three chain-gang escapees got into were hysterical.  Plus, the movie is fast paced and the cinematography excellent.  Furthermore, it was refreshing that the movie didn't include any obscenities or explicit sexual scenes.",1461801600,,485,5.246753246753247

1309422,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie remains one of my all time favorites. The combination of sarcastic and dopey humor with a different time period and pure absurdity of some of the storylines within the film makes it an instant comedy classic. George Clooney nails his performance as always, and his back up crew and entertaining cast of characters he meets along his journey keeps you laughing and entertained for the entire duration of the film. If you haven't seen O Brother, Where Art Thou? yet, I wholeheartedly recommend you pick this one up. You won't regret it.",1461542400,,545,4.808510638297872

1309837,5,B00003CXRM,I saw this film when it came out in the theatres and was curious to see how the producers blended the Odyssey with this story line. There are loose similarities but I was bowled over by the performances of these fine actors. Everyone does a top notch job and the film is hugely entertaining. The musical track is fantastic which I was not expecting. Essentially I went into the theatre expecting to enjoy it but was not expecting to love it!

1310283,5,B00003CXRM,"This retelling of Homer's Ulysses is superb in all aspects although it required two watchings for me to totally enter into the mood of it and reach the level of enthusiasm I now have for it.
I saw it when it came out and purchased the music cd of it at that time. Then, lately, I rented it through Amazon and without really trying, ended up watching it three times during the rental period. I could have purchased the HD for $12.99 but did not anticipate being drawn to it as I have been.
Through liking it so much and finding it so easily rewatchable, I decided to purchase it.
I'm happy that I now have my own copy.
I would like to register my feelings of a fly in the ointment, however. After my multiple viewings of this masterpiece, I went to purchase and found the price was now $17.99.
It displeased me.
A big reason for my appreciation of it should also be noted. I was born in Oklahoma less than four years after the time depicted, @July 1,1937. and greatly enjoyed the nostalgic remembrances the movie evoked in me.",1455926400,3,1025,4.34375

1311275,5,B00003CXRM,"An excellent movie based on Homer's story of the Odyssey, set in 1937 America. The story follows three friends who have escaped from a chain gang in the attempt to find buried treasure before the valley where it is hidden is flooded by the opening of a dam.

The cinematography is excellent, the script writing is excellent and the humor is excellent. However, these are all matters of opinion. If you love crafty and well thought out humor that makes clever use of the historical context to push the comedy, then you will love this! However, my parents thought this was absolutely the worst movie they had ever seen. So, it does really depend on your type of humor.

I would recommend this movie to all and I definitely love it and cherish it as one of my favorites.",1449619200,,767,4.510791366906475

Casting and costuming, scripting and editing, setting and music all add equally to the larger vibe, feel, and quality of the film.

I would only temper that with the fact that comedy/humour is one of those ""to each, his own""  things.
George Clooney is particularly funny in this. He reminds me of Cary Grant in that he can be both a handsome, debonair character and supremely funny.",1447027200,,380,4.135135135135135

The music in this movie is unique to the time and the place.  The situation is hilarious.  The setting is historically correct.  The dialogue is superb.  Then, of course, there is George Clooney.  The idea of prison escapees brave enough to undertake this daring escapade with no real plan sets the stage for a plot that possesses all of the twists and turns of a crime novel: nearly being caught, the intervention of a ""preacher,"" the need for food and drink and how difficult that is to obtain and, of course, a political event that really takes the cake!  Now, with this blend of masculine courage, bravery, and testosterone, there is introduced a petite little lady who has the ringleader under her thumb.  The sole intent of retrieving her ring leads them on yet another adventure that includes a flood of gigantic proportions.  You will love this.

(Oh boy excited) well as the movie started to unfold I found myself kind of glued to it. Let's face it George Clooney is easy on the eyes. I found myself genuinely concerned about the guy's, and how they would survive, in chains and jail attire. Okay the movie had me wrapped, and even feeling empathy for the survival of these men. That might be a stretch for me considering most of the characters were mentally disturbed. As on any road trip, the rest areas are a very welcomed sight! I usually play around, try to stretch it out.

1312988,5,B00003CXRM,"Great story and acting conveyed clearly on the blu-ray format.  If you enjoy a good laugh, this is a must.  Story is, loosely at least, based on Homer's Odyssey.  If you are familiar with this epic poem, then the characters in this film become even more interesting (but it is not a prerequisite to enjoying this film).  All three leads (Clooney, Turturro, Blake Nelson) deliver spot-on performances with a host of great supporting roles.  Most of the characters seem to be characatures of themselves, magnified to larger than life proportions, but the Coen brothers, and the actors/actresses themselves, pull it off.  Highly recommended.",1437782400,,638,5.145631067961165

1313343,5,B00003CXRM,"This is my favorite George Clooney movie, and I think he was robbed of the Oscar that year.  It's such an unexpected, fun performance.  It's the story of three prison escapees who are on a journey for a treasure; but the treasure that they seek is not the one that they find.  There are so many scenes that will make you laugh out loud.  If you love words and the use of language, you will love this movie.  For example, ""Isn't this a spiritual oddity?  Pete & Delmar have been saved, and you've sold your soul to the devil.  I appear to be the only one unaffiliated.""  It makes me chuckle every time I think of that scene.  I've given this as gifts to others, and they love it as well.",1435795200,,686,4.175572519083969

Seeing George Clooney sing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" with that long beard is my personal highlight of the movie. It is an adaptation of the Odyssey, but don't try to show it to middle school kids, cause it's a little too obtuse for them to get the connection. Great movie, though.",1433980800,,400,4.569444444444445
1313825,5,B00003CXRM,"A very tongue-in-the-cheek look at the Deep South during the Great Depression of the late 1930's. A great score and George Clooney at his best.

1314066,5,B00003CXRM,"I wasn't very keen to watch this movie; I just couldn't understand what it was about from the previews, other than a movie about the depression. But everyone kept saying it was great, and it had George Clooney, so I finally watched it. It pulled me in from the first moment. It is smart, hilarious and fast paced. The characters are well acted and oddball in a way that is distinctly Coen brothers. Of course, as with all of their movies, I was immersed immediately into another time and place...Coen style. I was enjoying this movie but had no idea where it was going, if anywhere. What I finally realized, is that it is a love story. What kind of love story, I'll let you discover. This movie has one of my all time favorite scenes of any movie. If you've seen it, you can probably guess the scene. We had to watch that scene again and again to see the look on George Clooney's face. We also bought the soundtrack. Years later our entire family still watches this movie and quotes the lines frequently to each other. Sometimes we just cue up that scene when we need a pick me up. I can't recommend this movie highly enough, but then we all have the sane type of sense of humor in our family. If you don't like other movies by these guys, you probably won't like this one either.",1432944000,,1280,4.3375

A delightful treat, from the early frames to the fantastic finish..  This recent viewing would have numbered my 11th or 12th viewing since its release in 2000.  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson, with John Goodman and Lee Weaver among others had to have the time of their lives making this film...  Very deep..  One of my top 10 of all time and at 72 years old, I have enjoyed a lot of movies in that time span..

1314932,5,B00003CXRM,"I'm watching it right now (haven't finished it though).  I love it!

I saw it on TV on multiple occasions and I loved it then also.  The music is fun and interesting.  There is poking fun at the southern KKK of that time.  I didn't know that George Clooney had some singing and moving talent (I wouldn't call that dancing), but it was with the beat.  The singing was maybe dubbed, but it doesn't matter because it was done well and I couldn't tell.

The storyline was fun and the way that Clooney said his lines were an attempt to be overly literate and use big fancy words.  There isn't much swearing in it, at least I can't remember much.  That makes the talking easy to listen too.  His main buddies that followed him everywhere were the opposite in verbal and mental skills.  Their talent had it's own character.

One last point - Did I say that I loved it?",1427673600,,861,4.3125

The scenery and costumes seem period specific but really just a fun movie that reminded me of growing up in the country dirt roads of Arkansas. Really like the song that Clooney sings and the dance he made up to go along with it.

1316411,4,B00003CXRM,"I cannot say I'm a fan of the Coen brothers' work, but I like very much at least half of their films. For me, it all depends on a combination of three criteria:
1) all of their films are among the finest lessons of filmmaking technique you'll find in contemporary cinema. The technical achievement is taller every once in a while, so much so that you can consider the Coens as true ""authors"".
2) A lot of their work is fun to watch while you watch it. If it is not fun, there's always the chance
3) that it leaves a fine ""aftertaste"".
That said, this film is the only one of theirs that I've bought in every new format since its release in 2000. I consider myself a fan of ""The Big Lebowski"", but I don't feel the need to upgrade my Special Edition DVD of that one because it's not so bold as far as cinematography is concerned. This one, though, marks high in my three criteria, which means it always benefits from new and higher resolution transfers, like the one on this BD. This is as close as you can be to the 2K digital intermediate  the Coens used for post-production and color timing, which means it would't get a lot better even if 4K became a viable home video format in the near future (If you'd like to know what I mean, I suggest you read this: https://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct00/brother/pg1.htm).  My only regret is the surprising lack of extras, which is sad for a film with so much value in so many departments.",1418083200,5,1431,4.39622641509434

1316840,5,B00003CXRM,"This is a decidedly creative effort on the part of the Coen brothers.  The story line more or less owes its sequencing to Homer's Odyssey with a nod to its plot line, where the golden fleece is the treasure from a bank heist being sought by a trio of semi-competent chain gang escapees.  Clever use of sepia toning that dulls greens adds to an old time feeling for the deep South settings in which events take place.  George Clooney's deliberate over acting serves well to amp the comic elements of the film, which basically are what make the film work as well as it does (appropriately named Ulysses, his frequent fussing with his hair using ""Dapper Dan pomade"" is an ongoing theme).  The supporting cast is excellent, providing hilarious caricatures for most of the plethora of lame Southerners the movie industry has loved to lampoon over the years (fat politicians, KKK loonies,  chain gangs, naive bumpkins, Bible salesmen, law men per Bonnie and Clyde, etc).  There's even a hilarious encounter with sirens as perhaps the most obvious nod to the Odyssey.  I've revisited this film twice now and my two later viewings only strengthened my appreciation for the film.",1414022400,,1170,4.849246231155779

Where does the title come from ? No, not the Odyssey,-- check out an oldie but goodie: ""Sullivan's Travels"", starring Joel McCrea  & Veronica Lake, written & directed by Preston Sturges.

What a cast... Clooney, John  Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Goodman !  Throw in Baby Face Nelson, chain gangs,  the KKK,  the Great Depression, three  female sirens, and the Ultimate American Roots Music Collection produced by T. Bone Burnett, featuring ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", sung  by the Soggy Bottom Boys. Stir well and enjoy !!  A modern day classic!!",1411516800,,718,4.818181818181818

In Odyssey the wife was suffering from an unwanted suitor.  Here the wife just appeared to be greedy and even turned the kids against their father.  I probably wouldn't recommend this movie but I guess it was worth seeing once.,1410393600,,402,4.2368421052631575

Following a story line loosely resembling Homers  Odyssey, one of the men is making his way back to his former wife to prevent her remarriage.  The use of down-home music to carry the tragicomic tone of this tale was wondrous.

Starting the movie you have no idea how it is going to end and at the end of the movie, you wonder how you got there from the beginning.

1317869,5,B00003CXRM,"George Clooney is a good actor but in this movie I'd consider him great.  The entire cast is perfect, Tim & John are equally great as their characters.  Charles Durning steals scenes whenever he's in them, but then it's Charles Durning, the man has chops when it comes to character acting.  By the time the movie was over, I wanted to vote for him in the ""upcoming"".  Holly Hunter didn't have enough scenes in this movie, she's an incredible talent, wish they could have used her more.  Funny funny movie about the emerging south of America during the Depression, one of my top 10 favorite comedies.",1401840000,,599,4.613207547169812

1317927,5,B00003CXRM,We enjoyed this DVD version of the movie. We watch it often and laugh just as much each time - very hilarious premise and the characters are fantastic.

1317993,4,B00003CXRM,"This was kind of a quirky almost whimsical take on Odyssey. These three guys are on a chain gang and escape. SO they decide the make their way home sort of and have weird adventures along the way. Thy meet Cyclops and sirens like Odyssey or at least a weird more modernized version of it. Well, its actually set in the 30s. George Clooney, John Turturro and John Goodman (who represents the Cyclops in Odyssey) are great in it as well as Holly Hunter who walks around say her new beau is Bonafied.  Its funny how George Clooney has to load a ton of this specific hair cream into his hair. I also love the Soggy Bottom Boys song Man of Constant Sorrow. Its very catchy.",1398816000,,668,4.301587301587301

1318039,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie is well made and perfectly depicts the south, especially Mississippi in which I unfortunately live (for 7 years now). Also, it accurately depicts the mentality of women in the south, always looking for a ""bonafide"" suitor (rich guy) to buy them a meal ticket out of poverty, while at the same time starting drama at every turn, because they have no life. I like to think that politics and business in Mississippi is pretty much the same now, as depicted in this movie, except for maybe some modern technology and newer automobiles. Southern baptist culture is the same, with superstitious ideologies and secret hatred towards blacks. All in all, this is a timeless movie, loosely based on  ""The Odessy"" by Homer, and well worth the price of rental.",1397779200,,759,4.838461538461538
1318040,5,B00003CXRM,This film is timeless. Every time we watch it we pick up on new details that just make us laugh out loud. The actors present perfect representations of their characters and the music brings the entire experience to life. It will not surprise me if this becomes a selection for the ages; I know it is with me. I usually do not like to watch a movie more than once every few years (at the most) even when I like it.

1318102,5,B00003CXRM,"I was raised in the South, by grandparents who lived through the Depression and the Dust Bowl era. I was raised on Bluegrass music and a simple, conservative outlook on life. And in my later years I was exposed to world and classic literature, which sparked a love for both. This film hit all of those notes in me, and remains one of my all-time favorites.

The Coen brothers have crafted a masterpiece with this work, and it remains one of George Clooney's best roles. The characters are lovably flawed, the landscape is character in itself, and the music ... dear Lord the music. It's like revisiting my childhood with better production value.",1395964800,,645,4.707964601769912

The whole cast does a great job and the writer knows how to tell an entertaining story with all kinds of twists and turns.",1394841600,,269,4.0
1318170,5,B00003CXRM,"I don't know if it's a classic, but it should be.  Older folks like me can enjoy the setting and humorous and nostalgic events and can relate well.",1394755200,,147,4.25
1318171,5,B00003CXRM,"Growing up in Mississippi in the transformation period when the ""New South"" status faded and is now what is the ""New South"" I witnessed changes as a youth or (yute according to cousin Vinny) I now realize the magnitude and significance of what I saw as how it played a part of in the history of our nation.

The film was brilliantly written and the performance of all actors involved was superb.  The humor can only be fully appreciated by those fortunate enough to remember Mississippi in the ""Old South"" period.  Each time I watch it I have trouble breathing due to laughter beyond my control.  The writers, actors, director and all involved in the production of this film created an almost perfect portrayal of the state during the years of the great depression with one exception.  There are no rocks or stones of any type or kind in the Mississippi Delta where the state prison is located.  At the beginning of the movie they were ""busting rocks"" which made a great scene to set up the story line.  However, I noticed those particular rocks and they are quarried in Arkansas Ozark Mountains.",1394755200,,1096,4.647668393782383

1318264,5,B00003CXRM,"This was a really entertaining movie with an old-time flavor.  The antics of John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as George Clooney's sidekicks were hilarious, and Clooney's role was central.  I loved their rendition of ""I am a man of constant sorrow"" which was voiced by a real country singer and his group, and the outrageous hillbilly dancing.  As cute as the movie was, be advised that there was some fairly brutal violence in it that you would not want children to see.  I would characterize this movie as an adventure film that involves a journey.  The three men escape from prison and go through a number of escapades and dilemmas as they meet a sequence of people along the way, some of whom end up being very significant to them in one way or another even though at first glance they don't seem so.  At the same time, Clooney's character goes on an inner journey in which he evolves as a man and outgrows some of his wayward tendencies--although not his vanity, as the constant reminders of his favorite hair pomade, Dapper Dan, show.  The photographic work was exceptionally good.  Throughout, the camera provides that old-time feel, probably through the use of filters, and the filming of the flood scene was amazing.  I would recommend this movie highly for adults.  I plan to watch it again before the rental time is up.",1394323200,,1331,4.67381974248927

1318344,2,B00003CXRM,"Idiotic film about a motley crew of escaped convicts (lead by the shyster supreme Clooney) who attempt to locate a cache of riches that the Clooney character has buried for himself. He is anxious to get off the chain gang so that he can retrieve his wealth, but long before the script can get to what it's about, it takes some absurdly inconsistent detours, one in a hick music recording studio, one in a KKK meeting (this part is actually disturbing), and one in a vintage movie theater...but if you're still interested in seeking the treasure by this time, then you don't understand what the Coen Brothers are doing here. And, in point of fact, I'm not sure that I want to. Religious beliefs, backwoods dialects, race, gender, and even talent are all parodied in a VERY insulting fashion here, all without the graphic and demonic violence that the Coen Brothers are usually all too happy to include in their efforts at telling narrative stories on screen--something they obviously have yet to perfect, in any case.
Most of these performances are very silly, and I have no idea as to why this film became as popular as it did. Some of the music is okay, but not of the kind of best-selling, ""oh my gosh you must hear it"" variety. It is an unusually framed and colored movie, but you have to have a pretty strong mind to handle the assault upon basic intelligence that this film proffers. Another pile of hand-me-down hogwash from the Coen Brothers, who actually manage to offend fans of Preston Sturges along the route of their cinematic destruction course. If you are interested in gaining wisdom instead of jumping upon the bandwagon, read the write-up by the accredited university professor near the back of Ronald Bergan's published biography of Joel and Ethan (in which the professor derides these guys because he explains that ""the message is that there is no message""--he can help you to understand why the Coen Brothers and their films are utterly pointless). It will tell you all that you need to know about these intellectually dishonest moviemakers, and will hopefully set viewers upon the proper path of rejecting movies such as this one.

Even the actors themselves, like George Clooney and John Goodman have stated that they had wished other actors should have been in this movie. Although it was nominated for an Oscar (2, I believe), they should have won more. We LOVE this movie, and I hgihly recommend that this movie should be purchased. This is well worth buying.

This story, based loosely on The Odyssey, has the great acting seen in all Coen movies (I enjoy seeing many of the same actors in their different movies and it's more like a family getting together to create). It's a fast, funny at times, crazed version of the old story of a lost man trying to find his way home. If you haven't seen it, it's a classic must see.",1387670400,,549,4.445544554455446

The scenes are beautifully set up.  And the music is amazing.  My teen daughter watched this in English at school and also loves it and likes the music.  This movie made this music cool to teens, which is pretty impressive.  There's not much plot, it's more of a character study.  Think of it like an extended music video with a little bit of a plot.

I'll admit right now that I'm biased because 1: I grew up in the south. 2. I grew up listening to true tales summoned from the photographic memory of my southern granddad - a man who sipped homemade scuppernong wine, could hunt, farm and fix anything, ran a cotton gin, a pharmacy, and worked as a rural letter carrier and later a postmaster in Treutlen, County, Georgia. He was a truly great southern storyteller who grew up during the depression and his stories of southern situations - sometimes hilarious, sometimes horrific - are exactly the sorts of tales that permeate the bleak, beautiful and sepia-tinted southern gothic world of Oh Brother Where Art Thou.

If you know or understand something of the south between the Confederacy and modern times, then you'll have an easier time appreciating the sometimes subtle and often obvious genius that permeates this entire film. If you know nothing of the south, you'll hopefully, simply appreciate a rollicking good retelling of Homer's ""The Odyssey.""

George Clooney is very appealing and likeable in this little oddball film. It grows on you after you get used to its style and music. But that is exactly what Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have accomplished with their resume of cinematic storytelling.

1319725,3,B00003CXRM,"The comparison of Everett in ""O Brother ...""  to Homer's  Oddysseus takes a whole lot of imagination . . .

The scene where the three escapees hopped the freighter was gut-busting-funny!  The music was great!
There was unnecessary swearing; specifically, the use of ""g-d"" as an expletive.
I would not recommend it as a family movie.

But I appreciate your giving me the chance to voice my opinion, and I am favorably impressed with the service from Amazon!

It's loosely but not that loosely based upon that ancient tale. O' Brother improved upon the Odyssey for one thing: it has a great soundtrack, which isn't surprising as Homer was not noted for his singing. If you like traditional southern music, it is a delight.

1320004,4,B00003CXRM,"Only the Coen brothers would be warped enough to come up with a tribute to the The Odyssey based in Depression Era Mississippi in their entertaining O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  Only the Ulysses this time is an escaped con, who along with two cohorts, embark on a surreal journey searching for an alleged ""loot"" that will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams.  But they're already rich and famous--they just don't know it.  Joining a fourth man who has just sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, they record ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" in a cracker box studio, calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys; the tune becomes a statewide sensation.  Yet Ulysses and his group are constantly on the run, primarily from prison guards intent on inflicting their own vigilante justice; en route the runaways encounter just about everything, from seductive sirens to a one-eyed con. . .even a choreographed Klan rally.  Yet as this delightful film comes to its climax, we learn the real reason Ulysses wants to escape from prison.

George Clooney is sensational as Ulysses Everett McGill, a smooth-talking persuader with a weakness for Dapper Dan pomade (no doubt a tongue-in-cheek spoof to Clooney himself). But even better are John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as Pete and Delmar, the fellow cons who escape with Ulysses.  Both sport enough clueless facial expressions and thick hick twang to make Hee Haw look like Masterpiece Theater.  John Goodman, always remarkably good, has a brief role as a one-eyed Bible salesman--a salesman with other intentions up his sleeve.  And the rest of the cast more than holds its own.  But the real stars of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? are the imaginative Coens, who through their images and music and settings serve us up a slice of Down South Americana. It's definitely humor with a dark edge; the flawlessly choreographed Klan rally (conjuring images of Nuremberg) is fabulously funny, yet its ugly point is unmistakably made.  Sometimes a bit too whimsical, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is still a grand satirical tribute to one of the oldest tales of time.

Director: Joel Coen
Writers: Based on Homer's Odyssey, Ethan Coen
Stars: George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman

I have followed the Cohen's since ""Raising Arizona"" another dark comedy that was well done, but not quite at this level.  This is a rich movie on several levels.  The story is great, and the casting, acting, and directing are excellent. The camera work is amazing, and the sets and scenery are outstanding.  The visuals and music incredible and they make us feel we are truly there.  Although film is considered an Art, it usually isn't up to the task of being art.  This film is truly art.  It is difficult to find a movie that is firing on all cylinders of all those individual crafts that make up a movie.  This movie will transport you to the Depression era and tell you a story of a small time crook that gets caught up in the politics of the time and receives his final salvation to return home from singing ole timey music.  I may have not been alive at that time, but I have seen enough films and heard enough stories from my father, grandmother, and others to have a good idea what it was like.  I wish my dad had been alive to see this movie, I think he would have enjoyed it.

1320473,5,B00003CXRM,"Of all the Coen Brothers' films, this is the one that seems to appeal to the most people. No matter where I go, I'll always find someone willing to have an ""O Brother"" quote battle with me. And that just goes to show the Coens' excellent power for writing (and adapting) spectacular dialogue. And when this writing is coupled with the Coen Brothers' similarly excellent casting choices? Perfection, my friends. Cinematic perfection.
As for the Blu-ray disc itself, Amazon shipped it to me in great condition, and the film has simply never looked better. The desaturated, yet always vibrant tones look alive and well on Blu-ray in contrast to the sort of monotone aspect the DVD and VHS took. Highly recommended.",1368576000,,711,4.884297520661157

I'm hard of hearing, though when my wife and I watched it together, I noticed she was having trouble with the dialog clarity also.

Apparently the Coen brothers thought it would be fun to pitch three protagonists into the deep South and cut them loose, so that they could act out comically in what Hollywood Jewish types believe the American South is actually like - a world defined by ignorance, racism, hypocritical Christianity, grits, hog wallers, and Bill Clinton. Oooops, scratch the latter - somehow the hillbilly South managed to produced a Rhodes Scholar Hollywood-liberal icon and if we admit that, it threatens all the stereotypes this film depends on. Forget I mentioned Bill Clinton; just blot it out.",1365897600,6,744,5.260504201680672
1320760,3,B00003CXRM,"Kept me entertained, though I found some character annoyenses (mostly the singing parts as they were just a bit cheesy) and there was just a touch to much going on in the plot.  Not really a type of movie you want to think while watching, but it tries to make you do that in order to follow an always moving plot line.",1365638400,,318,4.129032258064516

1320766,3,B00003CXRM,"This is an ok movie, but certainly not great.  I was drawn to watch it because the soundtrack is so terrific, but was disappointed.  The writers could have done so much more with the script, but just didn't deliver ~ unless random, unnecessary, out-of-character swearing was what they were attempting to showcase.  The excess of foul language really takes a lot away from this otherwise satisfactory movie, and the ending also seems a bit limp and ""meh"".
If you are considering buying (or even renting) this movie, you'd probably do just as well to watch the song clips that contain those bits of the movie and the trailer on YouTube.  You won't be missing much and it's free.
It does have some amusing bits, but the excessive foul language, mediocre story line and over-done plain stupidity and unrealistic ""dumb racist southern"" slant far outweigh those.  The soundtrack, however, is absolutely beautiful.",1365033600,,907,4.9801324503311255
1320767,4,B00003CXRM,"Were things really that bad in Mississippi during the depression? But then, this is  entertainment based on stereotypes and imaginary events so I suppose there is no need for historical / societal accuracy.  As a fan of folk & bluegrass music, I enjoyed the background theme of the music but thought that the escape scenes were a bit far-fetched.  There was no explanation of how 3 white boys could break away from a chain gang with armed guards on horseback watching every move. Later, sneaking into a prison dormitory to rescue one of their trio was also a bit of a stretch.  But again, this is a movie and in movies, especially semi-comedies, anything can happen.",1365033600,,666,4.7155172413793105

The storyline is a breath of fresh air delivered by 3 good actors of a mission to please.  You will laugh, you will find yourself reaching for your remote to rewind many a scene.  And you will continually ask yourself: How does George Clooney manage to look so good while simultaneously looking so filthy?  Good story with extremely colorful characters that proceed to get it done.  This movie does not dissappoint.  You will want a copy to watch at your leisure.",1363737600,,562,4.57

Loved the singing throughout the movie. Did not like the format it was delivered in. The delivery format was a collapsed 16.9. Really didn't like that. Having seen the movie before; most of the movie I watched was very compressed. Most of the details and a lot of the movie are hard to see or lost. Buy the dvd to really see this movie; worth seeing. Just be careful with viewing-does contain a lot of cursing.,1361836800,,586,4.485981308411215
1320916,5,B00003CXRM,"What can I say about this one? This is a fine example of the Coen brothers' fascination with the idea of unstoppable evil, and it makes good comic relief after a viewing of the similarly themed, but utterly grim, No Country For Old Men. You can watch it again and again and it never gets old. The soundtrack is also one of the greatest in all of cinema.",1361664000,,353,4.205882352941177

A good lighthearted story.

This is a story of conversion. There were many. The most dramatic conversion is near the end when Everett, who is like our modern day pagans, sees the prophecy of the blind old man come true. The blind man could see, and  unlike most secularist, like Everett, who cannot and will not.  One senses if this story would continue that Pete and Delmar would live out their lives peacefully, but  Everett will ""back-slide"" because he will always struggle with matters of Truth and matters of Everett.

1321597,5,B00003CXRM,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 ALL-REGIONS BLU RAY REISSUE ***

""Hot Damn! It's The Soggy Bottom Boys!""

When the Coen Brothers unleashed ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" into cinemas in September 2000 - it was an audio and visual sensation. The DVD that followed in 2001 received equal praise. But little will prepare fans for this truly beautiful 2011 BLU RAY transfer - it's properly gorgeous to look at - and up there with the best this (often frustrating) format can offer...

When it was originally filmed on location - a 'lossless' digital process was used to fully realise the specific light and scenery of Depression-hit Mississippi in 1937 (beautiful gold and yellow hues). That process combined with the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins both get to shine like never before. There are times when the visuals are quite literally breathtaking in their clarity. And the canvas to impress your eyes just keeps coming at you as the movie progresses from location to location - open fields, hay barns, twisted swamps, dust roads, river banks, inside period cars and beat-up trucks, the chain-gang detail, radio stations and bank interiors. Even in the notoriously difficult indoor scenes in ramshackle homesteads and around campfires at night - it all looks 'so' good. Add to this a blisteringly funny script full of savvy life-observations and brutal local colloquialisms - and it's hardly surprising that it was nominated for 2 Academy Awards in these areas (Best Script and Cinematography).

Defaulted to 2.35:1 aspect ratio - it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even when stretched to full screen - it rarely loses any definition. And better news for fans around the world is that this issue is an 'ABC/All Regions' BLU RAY - so it will play on every machine (as well as PlayStation 3 consoles).

Written and Directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" comes across as a sort of Three Stooges Road Movie with song accompaniment. Roughly based on Homer's Greek tragedy ""The Iliad"" about a journey of salvation with many ""ob-stack-les"" along the weary way - its genius soundtrack also sparked a worldwide interest in Blues, Gospel and Old Timey Country music - much of which had been long forgotten and often derided as hick and corny (2011 saw a 2CD 'Deluxe Edition' reissue of this). The film was immediately followed by the DVD release of the ""Down From The Mountain"" concert in Nashville, Tennessee featuring live music played by musicians on the Grammy-winning soundtrack. Anyone who has seen it will know that it's an equally joyful and musically charged experience. This is America before the sadness and loss of 9/11 - enjoying itself and celebrating its heritage - and rightly so.

The large and varied cast is exceptional - especially the grotesque caricatures that pepper scene after scene. Quinn Gasaway as a gun-totting boy in filthy overalls, Stephen Root as the bug-eyed giggling recording studio boss, John Goodman as the dodgy Bible salesman Big Dan Teague whose ears pop up when he hears the crisp click of dollar bills in a restaurant. His eye-patch signals him as the club-wielding one-eyed Cyclops. Wayne Duvall as the hood-wearing racist Homer Stokes trying to get elected over Charles Durning - the portly but wily Governor of Mississippi - Pappy ""Pass The Biscuits"" O'Daniel who also hosts a radio show. So many great parts...

The story goes something like this - chained together as a trio of escaped convicts - they are driven to find a $1.2 million dollar treasure Everett is supposed to have hidden in a shack in a valley that is to be flooded in five days time to build a massive hydro-electric dam. But they are being pursued by the Devil in sunglasses with his mean dog - Sheriff Cooley (played with relish by Daniel Von Bargen). After visiting a relative of Pete's called Wash (a man who rarely does) - the boys are hounded off the farm yet again. They then meet a Negro called Tommy Johnson at a crossroads and give him a lift (superbly played by Louisiana guitarist Chris Thomas King). He explains that at midnight the night before he sold his immortal soul to the Devil in return for a guitar that he ""sure can play"" (like the folklore surrounding Blues legend Robert Johnson). Delmar is appalled but Everett sees a business opportunity. If they can get to a radio station on the outskirts of the State - there's a man there who'll give them money to ""sing into a can"". They eventually get there - pretend to be The Soggy Bottom Boys - do a charged rendition of ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" - and cut a record. But unbeknown to the hapless crew - a radio hit is born that will literally save their souls (and lives) in the end. But before they can get to that redemption of sorts - all sorts of journey hilarity ensues - including a reunion between Everett and his estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter) and their 4-strong progeny of mouthy daughters. There are gun-battles with a madcap bank robber George 'Baby Face' Nelson who shoots livestock because he hates cows (a fantastic turn by Coens' favourite Michael Badalucco) and sexy Sirens by the river who turn Pete into a horny toad. It all ends with tins of Dapper Dan pomade floating by the screen when the big flood comes (along with everything else)...

The music deserves a special mention. While audiences expected to howl with laughter and cringe at the array of unhygienic ingrates displayed on screen - what they hadn't expected was to be so moved by the old-timey music - full of ballads about heartbreak, poverty and death. A perfect example is The Cox Family singing ""I Am Weary (Give Me Rest)"" on a truck at a town gathering - the melody and lyrics are genuinely moving. The congregation making their way through the trees to the river to be baptised as they sing (Acapella) ""Down To The River To Pray"". Country and Blues musicians also have on-and-off-camera cameos - Clooney lip-synching in the recording booth is really being sung by Dan Tyminski of Alison Krauss' band Union Station - Gillian Welch asking for a copy of the song in a record shop - Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch and Emmylou Harris provide the Acapella vocals as the seductive Sirens on the river - Ralph Stanley of The Stanley Brothers singing ""O Death"" as Tommy is led by a lynch mob to a gallows and a burning cross - The Fairfield Four Gospel group singing as they dig graves by a log cabin...

But the movie belongs to the three principal leads - John Turturro as the permanently moaning Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson as the less than Mensa-material Delmar O'Donnell (a role he would revive to great effect in ""Flypaper"" - see review). There is a rare and completely believable chemistry between them. But the big revelation here is George Clooney playing the philosophy-jabbering Everett Ulysses McGill. While he doesn't quite reach the cult-inducing peaks of Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' in the Coens incomparable ""The Big Lebowski"" (a part emblazoned into cinema lover's hearts forever) - Clooney shows a deftness of touch for comedy and pathos throughout that is quite fantastic. More importantly he seemed to finally park his devastatingly handsome good looks by taking a career chance and showing the world that he was more than just a pretty face. Clooney can act his soggy pants off if given the right part (something he's proved many times since).

The only real let down is the paltry extras (those that accompanied the initial DVD issue) which last only a few minutes and leave you craving more.

Still - this is a fantastic advertisement for what BLU RAY can offer. I only wish I had a humungous home-cinema system to watch it on.

To sum up - after they fail to catch a passing train full of men with ""aimless lives of wandering..."" Delmar is asked by the other two squabblers to give the deciding vote on who is leader of the trio. Delmar sappily says - ""I'm with you fellas!""

I wholeheartedly agree.

1321598,4,B00003CXRM,"The Coen Brothers have to be in my top five, as far as favorite filmmakers go. They're incredibly creative, witty, and abstract. While ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" may not be Joel and Ethan's best, the film certainly has more than enough redeeming qualities to be a pretty enjoyable one. Humor was a constant all the way through, although it was often more subtle than I expected it to be. It took me no time at all to pick up on the parallels between 'O Brother' and Homer's ""The Odyssey"", and going into my second viewing knowing this film was based on that made it even more aparent. The story follows three guys through 1930's Mississippi on a mission to find a burried treasure, that turns out to be more than they expected.

George Clooney, John Tuturro and Tim Nelson play Everett, Pete and Delmar. This goes without saying, but George Clooney was fantastic. I've been hearing people say he's overrated a bit too often lately. I call bullshit. He's one of the wittiest, and gives some of the greatest soft-spoken perfoamces that I've seen. Maybe watching this film right after The Descendants allowed me to appreciate his abilities even more. Tim Blake was pretty good as dimwitted Delmar, and I often felt bad for Tuturro's Pete. I especially liked John Goodman's appearance, despite how short it was. There are always memorable moments in the Coen Brothers' films, and O Brother Where Art Thou does not disappoint. It has quite a few memorable moments, and this is the only film I can think of that'll make you both laugh and feel bad for cows at the same time. I recomment it.",1341792000,2,1585,4.640569395017794

1321602,1,B00003CXRM,"I really, really like the Cohen Bros., but I really, really hated this film.  Watching it was like chewing ice cubes while being run over by a really slow steamroller.  Trust me, I understand what the Cohen boys were trying to do with this movie, but I also understand what Facebook was trying to do when they IPO'd at a $110 billion market cap.  Failure is failure, regardless of past perception.

In short, this film is a mess; and a mess that is so long that the best part of it is the closing credits because then you know it's actually over.  You'll never get that time back, but it's over.",1338940800,2,595,4.324324324324325

1321671,5,B00003CXRM,"This story is built around the ""Odyssey"" by Homer, and although the following of it is very loose it does not take away from the fact that this is a great film. I would hope you have some idea of what the ""Odyssey"" was like, but if you don't this movie is about a man's journey to return to his home. It is filled with adventure and in the case of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" lots of modern day comedy. I would say it doesn't offer too much for children, and does have some light violence (animal killing and guns) and some occasional swearing. This is why it is rated PG-13

Overall the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed it back when it was first released and I was 15-16, and the most recent time I watched it which was last night.",1337212800,,741,4.145833333333333

1321677,5,B00003CXRM,"This Coen brothers' retelling of Homer's ""The Odyssey"" is an Academy Award winning modern day classic and the Blu-ray remastering does it justice. My living room theater set-up is reference quality (Integra DTR-50.3, Jamo Concert series surround, Sherbourn 7x200 amp) and I'm something of an audiophile. The ambient sound in this movie has always been in my top 5 and the remastered DTS-HD doesn't disappoint. For two great examples of what true surround can sound like, skip ahead to the scene in which the three escapees are roasting gophers over a fire and a group of born-agains march through their camp like ghostly apparitions to a river baptism. The other great scene is the clan meeting that they infiltrate nearer the end of the movie.

As far as the video I would tend to say it's on par with the audio or possibly better. If I remember correctly this movie was one of the first shot on digital media instead of film back in 2000 or 2001. It gave the Coens more control over the saturation effects they used to bleed out the color schemes of the movie, giving it that dusty, southern summer look in yellows and greys. Even though it was shot in digital I believe they still used a 24 frames per second format (or the digital equivalent, anyway). It seemed pretty flawless to me and thanks to the Academy Award winning cinematography it's strengths are on display.

I won't get into the actual content of the movie and I have only seen a few bits of the extras so I can't honestly comment on those either but for the blu-ray remastered audio/video I'd say this movie should get a 9.5 out of 10 and that's because I don't think anything will ever be a perfect 10.",1333929600,4,1671,4.566666666666666
1321678,1,B00003CXRM,This movie was the worst ever.  It was a complete wasted evening and to think I spent $1.99 for the instant video.  The humor was about 2 mins.  Very poor.  NOT a family movie.,1333152000,,176,4.088235294117647
1321718,2,B00003CXRM,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, the Blu-Ray version has serious problems. It will play in an older Sony Blu-Ray player, but it won't play in my newer Sony Blu-Ray player. After over an hour on the phone with tech support at Sony, I learned that many new Blu-Ray discs are having problems and they cannot keep up with the firmware upgrades. Since Sony is one of the originators of the Blu-Ray format, I am obviously disappointed. They said that only if enough customers call in with the same problem will they commit the time to make their player work with a disc based on their technology. Before purchasing a newer release on Blu-Ray I would recommend verifying that the manufacturer of your Blu-Ray player has already verified compatibility.",1332979200,2,767,4.731343283582089

1321781,5,B00003CXRM,"Maybe the perfect adventure film, this instant Coen classic is impossible to turn away from. Though it makes no mistake about its influences - an early title card immediately identifies the picture as an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey - the brilliance of O Brother is in its departures from the source material, which come so frequently that the carryovers (the Sirens, the Cyclops, the protagonist's escape from captivity) are celebrated as nods and winks, expected but also unexpected. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the story's epicenter, while guest spots from John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning take the whole mess over the top. Amazingly rich, sharp-witted, engrossing stuff that's accompanied by an all-time favorite of a soundtrack.",1326672000,,837,5.446153846153846

1321862,5,B00003CXRM,"For a lot of people like me who live in the Deep South, this movie has become a cherished cultural gem since it was released ten years ago.  Not only is it one of the funniest movies the Coen Brothers have ever released, it seems like every man, woman, and child south of the Mason Dixon is issued a copy of the soundtrack at birth.

This movie has begged for a BluRay release since the inception of the format.  It was one of the first movies to be given digital color correction in post production, which gives the movie a sepia toned look reminiscent of photos you'd find taken in the era.  There are a ton of wide shots that feature a late summer landscape of Mississippi, which are going to look awesome in high definition.

It usually doesn't make a whole lot of sense to spend a few bucks extra for a BluRay of a comedy movie, but this is one exception where it's absolutely worth it.  The only downside about this BluRay is that it's taken so long for it to be released in the first place.",1315785600,2,997,4.248677248677248

1321864,5,B00003CXRM,"Wildly imaginative retelling of Homer's Odyssey from the ever-unpredictable Coen brothers, who transfer the classic poem to depression-era Mississippi.  Included are clever references to the Cyclops, Sirens, Lotus-eaters and many more.

Dapper, smooth talking Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) breaks free from a road gang with his two dim-witted partners to whom he is chained (John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson).  Together the trio sets out on an epic journey across the state to retrieve a fortune before it is drowned beneath the waters of a man-made lake that will be created by the completion of a dam.  Along the way they encounter a crooked Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, a blues guitarist who has sold his soul to the Devil, a tommy-gun-toting gangster, and the Ku Klux Klan, all the while recording a hit record that tops the country charts.

Beautifully photographed in a sepia -colored haze, chock full of traditional bluegrass music, brilliantly written and directed by the Coens, who  elicit wonderful performance from the three leading actors, as well as supporting players like John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning.

This is one of those love `em or hate `em movies .  Give it a shot.  It's hard to guess which camp you'll fall into.",1313020800,,1272,5.106280193236715

1321935,5,B00003CXRM,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? starring George Clooney, Tohn Turtubro, Tim Blake Nelson and John Goodman with Holley Hunter, is an unusual, twist of lemon, kind of off kilter comedy that when a loaned copy was not return, I had my wife buy another one for us to view throughout the year as a repeat movie.  For us, it ranks with ""My Cousin Vinny.""

George Clooney's fixation with his hair and his claim to being a ""Dapper Dan"" man, and the crack-up line, repeated ""We thought you was a TOAD!""  the FUN music, makes it a HIT FLICK! It includes bazaar things like when the three escaped chain-gang prisoners are unaware that they have become over night recording stars, and Clooney, finding his three little girls, is shocked to hear that his wife told them ""Daddy was run over by a train,"" and has found a new boyfriend who is ""bonified,"" suggesting their ""now alive Daddy"" is not!, fires Clooney with renewed zeal to re-capture the love of his wife and have his family back together once again. Clooney's character convinces the other two prisoners all chained together, (which forces them all to escape together on Clooney's lead) - that he is going to retrieve a lost treasure.

If you have kids, they will laugh along with you throughout this movie.  The characters, the baptisms in the river, the eating of gophers over a camp fire, and Clooney's constant obsession with ""My hair!"" just makes for a really FUN movie.  So much so, that after just writing this I'm tempted to watch it again this weekend!  A clean, but really unusual, very funny movie!

1321941,5,B00003CXRM,"""... I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought...""

The Cohen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, have a certain style as co-directors, and they have certain regulars who often turn up in their ensemble casts: John Turturro, Holly Hunter and John Goodman from OBWAT? have been in Cohen Brothers' films before. OBWAT? is similar in some ways to other Cohen Brothers' films such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, or Raising Arizona, but it stands out, even among Cohen Brothers' films, as a singular achievement. It has been described by them as ""a hay seed Lawrence of Arabia."" It is also a Three Stooges film, with Clooney as Moe, Turturro as Larry, and Tim Blake Nelson as Curly. There is a bit of Popeye, a bit of Ma and Pa Kettle, and yes, the story is based loosely--very loosely--on Homer's Odyssey. The film addresses lofty topics like racial intolerance and political corruption, but in a very humorous way. The film has its own color--kind of a hot and dusty yellow--and music is an integral part of the cinematic OBWAT? experience. While not a musical per se, there is a plethora of blues, gospel, and 'old timey' music to savor. All of these diverse elements are combined here under the able direction of Joel and Ethan Cohen.

""... pick up the pieces and retie the knot, mixaphorically speaking... ""

Not content to rest merely on their directing laurels, The Brothers Cohen also contribute to the film with their writing. Homer is listed as one of the writers (and good luck getting him or his estate paid their royalties, since none of them are to my knowledge members of the Writers' Guild). Like Homer's Odyssey, a man takes a journey that takes him far from home, but he longs to return to his wife and family before she succumbs to other suitors' advances. Along the way he encounters challenges, such as a Cyclops and some very seductive sirens. But it is what the Brothers Cohen do with the narrative structure provided by the Odyssey that stamps OBWAT? as a Cohen Brothers' product. Especially the dialogue, in particular the words spoken by George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill. He speaks with the eloquence of a backwoods philosopher, but sometimes his thought process is flawed, mixaphorically speaking. He sees himself as having the ""capacity for abstract thought"" but those thoughts are at times perhaps a bit too abstract to be practical. Though his thoughts aren't always logical, as he tells Pete, ""it's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.""

""... I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated ...""

Clooney is perhaps best known as a dramatic actor, but he has an undeniable flair for comedy. His McGill is quite a creation--an arrogant buffoon who thinks he knows it all while he clearly does not, and yet he is quite endearing. He is kind of a snob, refusing to use FOP because he is a Dapper Dan man, and yet somehow the audience can't resist his obvious charm. John Turturro is a bit harsher as Pete Hogwallop, but he also wins over the audience. Another brilliant characterization for this talented actor. Tim Blake Nelson is a revelation as the naive, good hearted chain gang escapee Delmar O'Donnell. One is reminded of Buster Keaton when TBN is onscreen. The dead pan expression that says it all.

""Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys performing ""Man of Constant Sorrow""?

I had the good fortune of seeing Alison Krause and Union Station perform in Bakersfield when they were riding high on the crest of the OBWAT? wave. The guitarist for this group, Dan Tyminski, is the guy who actually sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" while Clooney lip synched it. T-Bone Burnett did a fantastic job producing the music for this odyssey. From the seductive song of the sirens, to the blues of Tommy Johnson, and the hit song of those fabled Soggy Bottom boys, or the gospel numbers like ""I'll Fly Away"" it was all top notch. The soundtrack all but swept the Grammies, very unusual for a sound track LP, but understandable, given the caliber of the music.

""... if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?""

One final thing I'd like to mention about OBWAT? is the cinematography. The film was shot in the traditional manner, on film, but then the images were manipulated digitally, to give the film a dry and dusty look, like an old time sepia toned photograph, and watching it, you almost feel like you are Grapes of Wrath migrants fleeing the dust bowl in the depression, or chain gang escapees with hell hounds on your tail. The DVD contains bonus material, and one of the segments details the way that color was used to enhance the look, by digitally altering it. They pioneered some cutting edge film processes, and in spite of how modern that may be, it all went toward creating a look that made you feel like you'd traveled back in a time machine to the dry yellow dust bowl of the depression era.

""Well, that right there may be the reason you've had difficulty findin' gainful employment. You see, in the mart of competitive commerce... ""

In conclusion, OBWAT? was a triumph that featured excellent directing and writing from Joel & Ethan Cohen, great acting from Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and the rest of the ensemble, fabulous music put together by T-Bone Burnett, and great cinematography. You don't have to know about Homer's Odyssey to enjoy this film. It can be enjoyed by fans of Homer and fans of Homer Simpson alike.

For me, this is surely one of their best films, and it is one that I have grown to love (considerably) over the years.  It sports Clooney's best performance to date (seriously) and one of the smartest scripts of the decade (or forever), using the powerful `Odyssey' as comic relief.  The humor is strictly `Coen' style, which is why it may not be ideal for everyone, but you can't help but totally respect what they were able to do here.

I mean, this is genius, whether you `like' it or not.

Set in the 1930's, `O Brother, Where Art Thou' tells of the adventures of three escaped convicts (Everett, Pete and Delmar), as they search for hidden treasure.  In true `Homer' fashion, the three convicts come across a slew of strange character that play a central part in their journey (including a brilliantly realized side-plot involving the KKK).

The film reeks of style, period drama brilliance oozing from every nook and cranny of the film.  The comedic timing is flawless, and it is one of those films that really helps establish a star.  A lot of people make claim that George Clooney is a great actor, and while I like him, I find that he was certainly better `before' he became big.  His star persona skyrocketed in 2005 after he garnered Oscar nominations for his action (which he won for) and his directing, but his early 00 work is far better than what he's been putting out as of late.  His work in this film, as well as `The Perfect Storm' and `Solaris', is some of his best work ever.  I find that I appreciate George as a comedic actor over a dramatic one, his that is why his performance in `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will remain my favorite work from him, ever.

The film retains an avenue of suspense, which only helps sell the comedic overtones (think `Fargo', which would have been pointless without the dramatic underlining).  This is a stunning example of what the Coen brothers are capable of, and why they will be remembered as one of those directorial pairs that helped shape the way we look at cinema.

Funny, charming, dark, mysterious; full of breathtaking cinematography, appropriate (and catchy) music and memorable performances (John Goodman, a Coen staple, is magnificent as always), `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a film you won't soon forget.",1267488000,4,2352,4.661016949152542

1322275,5,B00003CXRM,"This is a wonderfully silly, smart (if maybe smarty-pants) film, weaving together several ""quest"" narratives, the oldest of plots--mostly the Odyssey, but  with many  nods to Sullivan's Travels (including the in-joke title) and the Wizard of Oz (especially the KKK-rescue  scene).  Lots of Americana in it (besides the great music).  It's not necessary to ""get"" the allusions, but I think those who hated the plot misunderstood it.  One criticism, however, does seem valid. O Brother relies on a lot of rural/Southern stereotypes.  The Coens are often smug in their character-mockery.  But the use of grotesque, cartoon-exaggeration is their way into surrealistic farce, and they make brilliant use of it as they do in all their films, taken as a whole:  from suicidal CEO's and personal trainers to rabbinical wisemen.  In their defense here, one might note that the Southern crowd turns against the hypocritical candidate when he begins spewing race-hatred. They want to hear the music. Joy and absurdist hope are as prominent as cruelty and corruption. A great film.",1264809600,,1069,5.235294117647059

In a vibrant sepia tone 1930's Mississippi, Everette dupes his friends into breaking out of prison to seek a fortune, but the fortune they find is not what they sought. Along the way, they get themselves into mishap after mishap, learn something about themselves and about life, and run across a bunch of similarly caricature-like characters.

O Brother blends some stunning cinematography, brilliant direction, quotable dialog, a very catchy soundtrack, great cast, interesting characters, memorable performances, excellent sets, and a thoroughly entertaining story.

Due to language and the social climate of the time, I recommend parental supervision or a slightly older audience (although it's carried out satisfactorily). Story based on Homer's ""The Odyssey.""

What a useless waste of time!  I fast-forwarded through much of it, seeking to at least find a song here or there to give the film credence.

I caught it on tv again one day which started my love affair with this film. I have probably seen it at least 100 times, if not more, and it gets funnier every time I see it.

My only problems with it are: 1.the Woolsworth scene is terribly edited and 2. the last scene has the McGill family missing a kid. If you count their daughters going over the train track- there's one missing?

My love for this film is that there is a quote for every issue in life:
When you wake up...""oh, my hair""; when you find yourself in trouble... ""we're in a tight spot"", having people problems...""only a fool seeks logic in the chambers of the human heart""; let someone down...""God forgive me""; how old you'll be in 50 years...""well, I'll only be 82""; come to spiritual knowledge...""come on in boys, the waters fine""; hostile towards cattle...""one thing I hate more than coppers is cows""; finished with an argument...""I've counted to three""; warn friends of impending danger...""do not seek the treasure""; and so on, and so on.

To that end, making this film required viewing in schools might get kids interested in classic literature. The lesson plan could even include watching ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" then reading Homer's Odyssey.

Still, this film is different than most of what shows up in theaters, and thus not everyone will love it, at least not on first viewing. I thought Clooney's character was over the top, and was disappointed to learn that he was the only one who didn't do his own singing. Great supporting roles all around, though.

To me, the best part is the music (2001 Grammy for Album of the Year).

1322500,4,B00003CXRM,"Cable TV classic. Often brings my channel surfing to a halt. Thumbs up to the performers and to those amazing filmmakers, the Coen Brothers. In particular George Clonney. He needs his Dapper Dan promade and when he says, ""We're in a real tight spot"" I care. John Turturro can't suc. Blake Nelson looks and sounds just right for the part. And John Goodman is terrific _as always_. The much ballyhooed about soundtrack is pretty good, but I agree that the 1927 Harry McClintock version of ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" *by far* is the definite highlight. I felt vindicated when I read influential music/culture critic Greil Marcus say the same. LOVE that song! Marcus says ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" by Harry should have been on the landmark ""Anthology of American Folk Music"". Btw, since I mention Marcus he hits the nail on the head here as regards the soundtrack: ""it's no surprise the album reached so many people so strongly--if you don't know this music, it's like doors in a mountain opening, and you can't help but want to go inside. It's an old-timey version of The Harder They Come soundtrack, and there's as much to discover in a more-where-this-came-from sense as there was there"". Right.

So yeah, as you may notice, it ain't ""Fargo"". But then what is? Well I was just thinking about this movie. I was not that impressed by it when I first saw it. But you know, I can't put my finger on **why**. And that is bothersome. Too high expectations? No. I didn't have many expectations one way or the other. Was it the, to my mind anyhow, - excessive buzz around it. Hmmm. That may have played a part. You just hear too much about somethan and it somehow takes away form the impact. You, without realizing it, end up a little turned off. It's like, ""that's it?"". That's what all the fuss is about?

Unluckely, 20 or 25 minutes after the beginning of the film, we found ourselves looking at each other, and thinking something like ""When will the usually original and funny Coen movie's plot begin?"". Well, It never did...
We waited for 10 or 15 fifteen minutes more, and as nothing interesting was yet happening on the big screen, took the decision of leaving the theater, and drove back to our hotel... Perhaps, we still had the chance to catch another movie -anyone would be better than this- on our room's pay per view TV.
By the way, anyone who intends to understand why the Coen brothers gained their fame of being part of today's great American filmakers (like Clint Eastwood, Martin Scosese, Francis Ford Coppola or Aaron Aranofsky), should see (i) the excellent ""FARGO"" (with Frances Mc Dormand and Willian H, Macy), (ii) the very good ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"" (with Frances Mc Dormand, Billy Bob Thornton and James Gandolfini) and ""BURN AFTER READING"" (with Frances Mc Dormand, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich), or (iii) the good ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" (with Javier Bardem -winner of the best supporting actor's Oscar for this performance-, and Tommy Lee Jones), who won the 2007 best film Oscar, although it should have gone, instead, to Paul Thomas Anderson's much better ""THERE WILL BE BLOOD""; absolutely avoiding ""BARTON FINK"" or this one (""O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?"").",1244937600,3,1702,4.792517006802721

The music in here is super, led by the catchy ""Man Of Constant Sorrow,"" performed by Dan Tyminski. I also loved ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" humorously sang and presented by the three main characters: George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Those three guys were hilarious, particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks. Audibly, the entire soundtrack is outstanding, under the direction of T-Bone Burnett.

Yes, I agree. This film is a perfect, I do mean perfect, film experience.

The only other thing I can mention and haven't mentioned is the music.

 Anyway...Apparently, the brothers based this screenplay on Homer's The Odyssey, and that makes me wish I had actually read it because then I would have a fuller understanding of what's going on.
Still, I enjoyed the weirdness and unexpected events--the sirens in the water, the one-eyed con man, the little girls singing, the sudden baptism, the camaraderie and chemistry among the three escaped convicts, and the climactic flood.
Minor quibbles:  Holly Hunter's role is so small that many other women could have played it; I'm not sure why George Nelson had to be in the film at all; I don't know if Klansmen really march around in formation and sing the way they do in the film; I remain in mystery as to the fates of Delmer and Pete at the end.

It is, basically, an updated version of Homer's Odyssey, but it also contains more then enough differences to be completely separate from Homer's Odyssey, the main one being that the movie has nothing Supernatural about it (except maybe ""The Devil,"" but then even he was human).

And it's not only the music. From references to Busby Berkeley (the men on the chain gang as the movie opens move in syncopated rhythm like the swimmers and dancer of the early Berkely films), to the ""Wizard of Oz,""  Chris Thomas King's ""Robert Johnson-like"" character who sold his soul to the devil at the cross-roads to learn to play guitar, to the James Agee and Walker Evans Depression Era photography, ""O Brother..."" is a gorgeous culmination of over 100 years of American filmmaking.",1207699200,3,913,4.670807453416149

This one shines brightly as the perfect epitome of cinematic experience. Enough can never be said for the genius of the Coen brothers concerning this masterpiece, based on Homer's 'The Odyssey"". This will always set an example and become a classic for movie makers to learn from for decades, perhaps centuries to come!

George Clooney sets himself apart from every other role he's ever played, and should have walked home with an Oscar for his hilarious portrayal of the perfect backwards southern gentleman and leader of the fictional Soggy Bottom Boys...""Believe me Delmar, woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days of man!"" John Turturro, ""Do not seek the treasure!!"", also rounds out the ""three stooges"" group with a magnificent performance with Tim Blake Nelson...""We thought you was a toad!"" John Goodman is perfect as the 'cyclops' personae of Homer's vision.

And then there is the soundtrack! As the 'angels' walk through the woods singing ""Down In The River To Pray"", you can actually feel the same awe and astonishment the Boys are feeling. You almost buy the fact that Clooney's lip-synch to ""Man Of Constant Sorrow"" is really his own voice, which only adds to the charm of the performance.

Like I said, 5 stars and 2 thumbs up aren't enough for this one! Those of you who didn't understand this film are just as hilarious as the movie itself. Clooney's 'Ulysses Everett' said it best...""I swear you boys are dumber than a bag of hammers!""

This movie is everything the Coen movies are not.

Instead of the brothers' usual dark and witty corkiness, we are treated with jokes so juvenile it rivals such classic as ""Dumb and Dumber"".

Instead of their habitual pinpoint accurate and fascinating depiction of a particular area, culture, social class, or population segment, we are immersed in some of the worst clichs about the South I have ever seen in recent times(Southerners are dirty, racist, retarded, and ""cultishly"" religious. Are we still really at that level of stupid bias).

Instead of a solid yet with unexpeted twist and turns scenario, we get a storyline that meanders around nothing and goes literally nowhere (and spare me the parallels with The Odyssey, which merely consist in having a guy with an eye-patch and some deadly girls charming the protagonists).

And what the heck were these guys thinking when they cast Clooney, with one of the worst bogus Southern accent that Hollywood ever had the balls to insult us with!?!

If you haven't seen ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" you've really missed a great movie. Very roughly based on events in Homer's ""Odyssey,"" this is a tale of three convicts who escape from a chain-gang in the 1930s. Their adventures are crazy, but insightful into the south during the Depression.

There are actually a lot of elements from the ""Odyssey."" The convicts meet three ""sirens."" A man running for governor has the first name of ""Homer,"" another man is blind in one eye, and in the end, the men wind up in a courthouse where ""Ulysses"" metaphorically slays the ""suitor"" of his wife.

In their over-the-top journey to find a stash of robbery money, they are involved in one incident after another that perfectly catches the spirit of America during the Depression.

The music is wonderful, and the songs and comedy will stay with you forever--""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Let's Meet at the River to Pray"" to mention two of the wonderful songs.

1322912,5,B00003CXRM,"O Brother, Where Art thou is a dark comedy imbued with shades of the mystical.  Based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer, it is set in hard-hit Mississippi during the 1930s Depression.  Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), desperate to get back to his wife and family, escapes from a Parchman chain gang with cantankerous Pete (John Turturro) and sweet, clueless Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and begins the long and arduous journey back home.  Along the way, the three adventurers meet a host of interesting characters, including George ""Baby Face"" Nelson and, with a bow to ""The Odyssey,"" three beautiful Sirens, a blind prophet and the Cyclops (John Goodman).  They join forces with Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who is reputed to have sold his soul to the devil for musical fame, and manage to save him from a Klan lynching.

George Clooney is perfect for the lead and John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are wonderful in their supporting roles.  In fact, the entire cast turns in outstanding performances.

The Coens describe the film as a ""Ma and Pa Kettle film with high production values,"" and that is certainly true.  The settings are true to the period and the artistic filming is in tint similar to the photography of the day.  Like photos from an old family album, scenes bring a touch of nostalgia for a way of life forever gone.

The folk, bluegrass and spiritual music are perfect for this story and add authenticity to the tale.  In the film, Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and King, calling themselves the ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" cut a record entitled ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" to earn money.  Clooney lip-syncs the song, which is actually sung by Dan Tyminski.  Tim Blake Nelson himself performs the song ""He's in the Jailhouse Now,"" also in the film.  The Soggy Bottom Boys' guitar accompanist, Chris Thomas King, who also performs the Skip James' blues song, ""Killin' Floor Blues,"" is an accomplished blues musician and recording artist in his own right.

The writers obviously did their research well.  The Southern politics and methods of campaigning, the Appalachian folk music and Delta blues, and the country customs, the dialog and expressions are right on target.  This film tells a story that is far more than just a comedy.  As a life-long resident of Mississippi, I found it touched me on so many levels.  The baptismal scene was awe-inspiring, the Klan meeting chilling.  The film encompassed everything I both love and hate about my great home state.  Even in its most comedic moments, it whispered truths.

O Brother, Where Art Thou garnered two 2002 Academy Award nominations:  Best Adapted Screenplay (Joel and Ethan Coen) and Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins).  For his work in the film, George Clooney received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.

Brilliantly produced and directed, from the cast to the script and the setting, this movie is as good as it gets.  O Brother, Where Art Thou is a masterpiece!",1186185600,,2977,4.8804780876494025

Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson are relentlessly hilarious in this loosely Homeric epic of escape from a chain gang in America's early twentieth-century South. You can love this movie without knowing Homer, of course, though it's based on that bard's Oddysey.

That's the common touch of both Homer and his erstwhile partners-in-crime, producers Ethan and Joel Coen.

Filming this flick must have been more fun than a body should have. From the blind oracle on the railroad pump-car warning about the 'Ob-stackles of life' to the 'Sigh-REENS' that appear to have 'loved (Pete) up ... and then turned him into a horny toad' to the delicious stares and triumphant penultimate scene where the Soggy Bottom Boys regale a political rally with their irresistable hit 'Man of Constant Sorrows', O BROTHER never falters.

It's quite unusual.  It's a comedy with music, long but pretty funny.

The film takes place in the depression era Bible belt south.  Southern Hymns ""Old Timmy"" style music is sung throughout the film which is quite beautiful. (Historically the music is from real depression era artists.  George Clooney's song and singer received a Grammy award for this film).  The meant to be absurd deep, deep, deep, south accents, names (""Hogwallop"") and dialog (""Hemp ya sef "") are hilarious.

Even the KKK's ridiculous song singing and choreographed dancing, takes the seriousness from there goal.

1322975,5,B00003CXRM,"OK. I've decided once and for all not to waste peoples' time and give a synopsis of each movie, knowing that it's already been done by the Plot Synopsis.

With that said...one of the things one can appreciate is seeing an actor play a character with a style and personality that he/she hasn't performed before.  Such is the case with George Clooney in ""O Brother Where Art Thou"".  In all the films and television shows I've seen that have included George Clooney, I've never seen him perform this character before.  A proud man Everrett, who sees himself as intellegent in the field of modernization and science.  But his world is thrown off balance when he, and his traveling companions Delmar and Pete, set off for home on a path that requires more faith than scepticism.  Homer's ""The Odyssey"" is well adapted, including a blind railway worker as the seer, three prostitutes as the Sirens, and a con man as the Cyclops.

The movie caused me to pick up Homer's ""The Odyssey"", translated by Robert Fagles.  It's a very moving and exciting read if you have some time on your hands.

Going back to acting, John Turturro's performance is classic.  He maintains the role of a hot-headed escaped prisoner throughout the movie.  And the singing, hillbilly scene with Tim Blake Nelson is hilarious.  Contrast this with his role as the slimy brother in ""Miller's Crossing"".

What is amazing is that the music is so well fitted for the plot.  Gospel and blues accompany the escaped convics as they travel seeking a hidden treasure, and is quite appropriate considering the spiritual journey the men are faced with.  It's interesting how Everrett takes a 180 degree turnabout regarding faith, then is quick to dismiss it minutes later.

1323040,4,B00003CXRM,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a 20th-century version of Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"".

The story focuses on three escaped prison-farm inmates who face a series of overwhelming odds in their effort to ""seek the treasure"" buried on the homeplace of the gang's self-appointed leader (played by George Clooney). A side impediment is Clooney's on-going effort to procure a tin of ""Dapper Dan"" hair pomade. His pompous ""I'm a 'Dapper Dan' man"" means he will not settle for a lesser brand.

Aside from getting to the treasure, Clooney's character has limited time to get to his hometown before his former wife marries another man.

Each disaster causes another delay in reaching the homeplace before it is relegated to the bottom of a brand-new lake.

The movie is liberally laced with knee-slapping humor and Depression-era country music (old-time Hillbilly) which is very well-executed (and, with one exception, lip-synched to singers who specialize in that genre). Even this editor, who has a life-long loathing of that kind of music, can't get enough of it!

Outstanding scenes include: a comic deep-south politico wonderfully portrayed by the marvelous Charles Durning; a hypnotic vocalization of ""Go to Sleepy Little Baby"" by the three ""sireens"" (sic); his normal outstanding performance by one of this editor's favorite thespians, John Goodman; and a blood-chilling KKK lynch-mob scene, the choreography for which can rival a Rockettes performance.

The film takes place in Mississippi, the heart of the deep south, during the depression. Ulysses Everett McGill, charmingly played by George Clooney, who displays some real comedic talent, is a dapper dan of a fellow. Working on a chain gang, he escapes along with two other felons, disarmingly played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They are on their way to hunt up some buried treasure, the proceeds of a robbery, which McGill claims to know about. It later turns out that this was a mere ruse on the part of McGill, as he really had a different agenda.

During their episodic odyssey, they encounter a motley crew of characters who brighten the cinematic landscape. The film also resonates with the sounds of blue grass and down home country music. The cinematography is wonderful, as it conveys the dustbowl feeling of the depression era, rural countryside. All in all, it makes for a pretty terrific, though highly unusual, film. Funny and, at times, enigmatic, it is a film only the Coen Brothers could or would make.",1165622400,,1409,4.746938775510204

It was recommended by the textbook my children used for Homer's Odyssey, and at first, I thought the writer of the textbook was crazy, but when I saw the movie, I understood.  The movie follows Ulysses (the Latin version of the name Odysseus) Everett McGill through his adventures with the Lotus-eaters, the Cyclops, the sirens, you name it.  And who would have thought you could find a Cyclops in Depression-era Mississippi?  This is a great movie:  a great plot, a great script, great acting, a great look and feel, and a great sound track. It's very touching, and really funny.  It's a musical, but not the Rogers and Hammerstein kind -- the characters don't just break into song for no reason. Well, except when they decide to ""sing into the can"" at the radio station.  They are simply surrounded by music, and really fun music that adds to a really fun movie.

Based on Homer's ODYSSEY, the film involves our three heroes/stooges in some unusual adventures, all leading to a lot of twists in its looney conclusion.  What makes it work is the spirited performances of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as the escapees; the charming bluegrass music including the surprise smash hit I AM A MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW and some nice bits from supporting players John Goodman and Holly Hunter.

1323117,5,B00003CXRM,"George Clooney and his terrific co-stars in ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" create colorfully believable characters who present moviegoers with a comic reflection on a period in American History we might well forget. Thank goodness for this movie because I believe the popularity of the plot along with the excellent CD movie track will keep America's dark secret of discrimination practiced in pre-World War II Mississippi from falling off our cultural landscape. Couched inside the politically correct safety blanket of colloquial comedy, the three escaped prisoners (Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)take on individual situations of racial prejudice in Mississippi, with unlikely charm and innocence, in contrast to the seriousness of the issues. All the while they are on the lamb, the three men are becoming popular with southern country music lovers because they serendipitously recorded a song with a blind radio producer who didn't know they had latched on to a Negro guitar player - thus creating a de-segregated or ""mulatto"" performing group.  Charles Durning is a favorite actor of mine, and his performance as the incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel is memorable for his colorful irreverence for hyperbole but also for his refreshing political honesty. This movie is worth seeing over again because it leaves Americans with something to remember about our past - so we're not doomed to re-live it.  Although the movie is loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey"", this analogy doesn't really cut it with the elite set - rather, this movie is about what it's about,  and I don't believe it should be given any pseudo-intellectual accoutrements.

1323235,5,B00003CXRM,"I cannot recommend O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? highly enough.

The Coen brothers skillfully revive classical literature (The Odyessy of Homer) in the story of three wanderers trying to find their way home, and recall American history in a beautifully imaginative, archtypal way.

For example, the main characters are three hoboes whose downright stupidity, ineptitude, pathos, and vulnerability are much too exaggerated to be realistic--and that's the point. They're supposed to be emblematic and archetypal, and as such they are a triumph.  They are also hysterically funny.  They are lost, vulnerable, dirty, unlettered but sweet and innocent, hopping freights, trying to keep body and soul together.

George Clooney masterfully portrays one of the bedraggled trio, dumb, dizzy, clueless, but handsome and masterful, with more charm than the law allows--indeed he is consciously recalling the legendary charm of Clark Gable with grace.  I'm sure Gable would be honored.

John Turturro is also clueless, dumb, and vulnerable, with intensity extreme anguish, and confusion added in.  The combination can't help but make you laugh.  He's the one that keeps ending up in deep doo-doo through no fault of his own.  He emits a silent scream that sends his buddies running to rescue him, stumbling all the way.

The third of the team is mild mannered, dumb, confused, innocent, toothless, and incredibly sweet and supportive--up for anything he has to encounter (just like Ulysses).

And the challenges are as daunting.  There is a chilling seen of a Klan meeting: There are hundreds of Klan members dressed in those evil, medieval-looking robes with the pointed hats, marching in a circle with burning torches, evoking the monkey guards of THE WIZARD OF OZ and the depraved monks in THE NAME OF THE ROSE.  They are approaching a huge, burning cross upon which they plan to lynch a black man.  This part is not funny.  But, again, it is even larger than life (if that is possible in the case of the Klan) and seems more of an archetype than an attempt to mimic reality.

The snippets of folk music on the soundtrack throughut the movie are the icing on the cake.

American history and its folkways are clearly close to the Coens' hearts.",1150070400,3,2231,5.032697547683924

1323303,5,B00003CXRM,"I'm a big fan of the Coen Bros., including Raising Arizona, and esp. Fargo, so I was expecting to enjoy this.

What I was not expecting was that I would be absolutely enraptured by it.  I was so enveloped by the sense of place, the razor sharp acting, the constant self-inflicted misfortune, and especially the music.  The music!  What a stunning, skillfully rendered and executed soundtrack.  I didn't realize what I was missing all these years, ignoring bluegrass the way I did.

Well, back to the movie.

I don't have to repeat all about the movie being based on Homer's Odyssey... oops, just did.  Well, that aside, I spent some time thinking about what touched me and made this so enjoyable, more than nearly every other movie I've ever seen.  I found many things.

Of course, the casting is delightful.  Where do you find people who can pull off Clooney's sidekicks the way they did.  If I met John Turturro or Tim Blake Nelson on the street, I would probably be just shocked to find they aren't doltish hillbillies!  John Goodman is a perfect cyclops, in a goofy, ominous, hulkish way, and Christ Thomas King, who I believe is really known for his guitar playing, still plays the understated Tommy Johnson beautifully, as if it makes perfect sense to meet the devil at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere and sell your soul to him for a good dose of guitar skill.  I could go on and on about the cast, but you won't find a sour note in there.  You'll be convinced that none of these people could live anywhere but the Depression ear South.  Before I move on from the cast, something that goes unmentioned a lot, is the brilliant performances by some of the bit players, such as Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop, Stephen Root as the Radio Station guy, and Millford Fortenberry as the Geographical Oddity storekeeper.  It may seem easy to do a small part for a little time, but this really underscores the Coen Bros. talent for getting a pitch perfect performance from every actor, no matter how small the part.

Much has been made of the music... and rightly so!  I suppose it was less than surprising to learn that the music was actually a large part of the genesis of this movie.  You could almost say that this is a musical of sorts, not of the broadway style, but some sort of hybrid, as only the Coen Bros. can do.  My favorite musical moments are probably nearly the same as everyone else's, such as Man of Constant Sorrow.  How can you not just love that song?  The Sirens singing Didnt' Leave Nobody But the Baby with the way they used those rags for their loose-boned and sultry rhythm would certainly be tough to resist :)  O Death at a KKK rally, what a sendup that was!  The horrifying ridiculousness of that strangely choreographed scene was reminiscent of everything from the Nazi's Nuremberg rally to the Wicked Witch's guards from the Wizard of Oz (tell me you don't hear an echo of their ""Oh we love--Noooo one"" at the beginning of that scene.)  But I have to admit I was strangely moved and affected by my favorite scene, Down in the River to Pray, the baptism scene.  There was something beautiful, serene, and noble about those people in white, moving toward a turning point of purity and devotion down to be immersed in their new life.  I loved it, utterly.

You may have noticed by this time that I haven't really mentioned Clooney but in passing.  There's a reason for that.  Probably the one thing that most deeply moved me was the character of Ulysses Everett McGill.  Though it's not obvious at first, I think Everett is a beautifully developed, complex character.  As the movie went on, I began to see him as insecure, loaded with good intentions, but without the inner strength to carry them out, full of regrets, yet a slave to his own passions and his desire to be admired.  When we begin to realize that what Everett's looking for is to get his wife back, the whole situation seems just delightfully silly at first.  But underneath, Clooney manages to display McGill's sensitive and wounded heart.  He's terribly insecure and masks his insecurity with too much talk and a know-it-all attitude, as well as his addiction to Dapper Dan and his own appearance.  A very telling scene is in the Geographical Oddity shop, when he obviously wants to tell off the shopkeeper who can't get his car part or his Dapper Dan for two weeks.  He's mad and looks to storm out, but instead he crumbles and buys the pomade and hair nets.  I think a lot of people miss that one.  Everett is lost in a mess of his own making and is desperate to find that one rope strong enough to pull him out of the hole he's in.  I think we all know people, or have one time *been* people who have become mired in their poor decisions and are further derailed by their attempts to circumvent the consequences.  When people like this get that one opportunity to escape their pattern of failure they often miss it, but once in a while they grab hold and make it.  I'll let you see what really happens in the movie, but George Clooney and the Coen Bros. have wrought a beautiful, tragically flawed, yet good and loving at heart protagonist and should be long recognized for it.

I cannot recommend this movie enough, aside from what I've mentioned, it is loaded with fun and frolic, good and evil and the strange, enormous grey area in between, tragedy and triumph.  Some of the lines and gags in this movie are priceless and the sort of thing you find yourself saying to friends at odd times just to crack things up (Do - Not - Seek - the Treasssure!)  It bears multiple watchings well, as there are so many little details to pick up on, and its fun to find the direct Odyssey references within, some of them less obvious than others.

I'm not sure it's ever been so easy to give a movie five stars.",1138406400,132,5801,4.501912045889101
1323304,4,B00003CXRM,"I really love this movie and it would be absolutely perfect if not for its occasional lags in interest, especially during the space in which the two convicts lose their friend to the Sirens. But, I'm jumping ahead...let's get to the review.

The opening sequence is a great musical experience which begins with a 1930's singing chain gang, voiced by James Carter and the Prisoners (found on your best Blues collections.) That goes straight to ""Big Rock Cany Mountain,"" a bluegrass favorite, as we cut to Pete, Delmar and Everett hauling ass through a field, having escaped the gang and are searching for freedom. Amazing way to open the credits.

Once the boys are on their way, we get to meet them. Everett, played by Clooney, is a know-it-all with an obvious education and a vain care for his hair. Pete is an angry country boy who loves conflict - John Turturro is great in this part. Delmar is their sometimes innocent, always simple-minded end to the trio. Everett has talked the other two into escaping with him to find the treasure he stole, buried, and was sent to jail for.

This is a sometimes loose adaptation of Homer's ""The Odyssey."" The Cohen Brothers have admitted to never reading the book but they seem to have really studied the cliff notes front to back. If you look closely, you can find every piece of the film's inside to the poem. For instance:

The prisoners find a blind railpusher who tells their future just as Odysseus was told his by Tiresius.

Everett's first name Ulysees is Roman for the Greek Odysseus.

The Sheriff plays the part of the Devil. But, I think, the GOV candidate is supposed to be Poseiden. THAT IS made thinkable by the fact that the CYCLOPS/John Goodman is his minion.

The trance-like prayer flock that goes to the river to pray are just like the drug-addicted ""lotus eaters"" that Odysseus has to keep his troop away from.

John Goodman's Dan with the eyepatch is one-half of the ""Cyclops."" The other half of the Cyclops (which Odysseus outsmarts) is the blind radio announcer that Everett swindles out of extra money.

When Everett goes to find his estranged wife Penny (Odysseus' Penelope), he finds that she has found a suitor. Odysseus finds his wife and family overtaken by many suitors.

Everett gets beaten down by the suitor just as Odysseus gets jumped by many suitors.

It goes on but I won't list them all. What I want to mention the most here is the sterling sountrack. It's got a little blues, a shade of country, but tons of bluegrass that I had no idea I was a fan of until I saw the movie. Great favorites all around, well integrated into the movie. Parts that I loved the most in the film are...

""Damn! We're in a tight spot!"" (you'll know what I mean)

The opening.

Tommy the guitar player.

The major-hot Sirens.

Every time the boys sing ""Man of Constant Sorrow.""

""Angel Band"" from the end credits.

1323305,5,B00003CXRM,"The Coen brothers have done it again. After Fargo they made another brilliant and different movie.

It's an adaptation of Homer's Oddysey and there are numerous references to that ancient story.

Ulysses (*) Mcgill gets out of prison with two men who are next to him on the chain gang. They call themselves adventurers and it really is an adventure through the state of Mississippi. They meet sirens, a cyclops and a blind radioshow host (Homer).

Besides the ancient myths there are also some southern myths, like when they pick up Tom Johnson at the crossroads after he had just sold his soul to Satan to play guitar. A myth that later Robert Johnson took over and made it his own.

Talking about music, never has one movie done a type of music so much good. Bluegrass, country, gospel, beautiful music in the entire music. Getting the soundtrack is almost worth as much as the movie. Another thing that is soothing to the ear are the great dialogues spoken by George Clooney.

Soothing to the eye are the beautiful colors used. It was one of the first movies to digitally enhance some landscapes and because of that the colorsetting of the movie is now yellow, with some white and green and everything in between.

George Clooney, who plays a fugitive from a chain gang with a dry sense of humor, is excellent as well as his fellow partners in crime, Pete and Delmar.  Ulysses Everett McGill, Clooney's character, makes the movie really funny by the way he is so obsessed with his hair treatment.  He goes through quite a few cans of it because the look of his hair is very important to him.  The movie keeps your attention and goes by fast because each scene is so different and you never know what to expect.

I am tempted to describe all my favorite bits from the movie here, but it would just be way too much writing.  In my opinion, the best humor in this film is subdued, but it is also extremely clever and biting.  I also appreciate the loose connections with actual events and people from the period: Tommy (Robert) Johnson at the crossroads, George (Baby Face) Nelson, TVA projects, etc.  It probably helps if you don't hate old-time music and bluegrass, but being steeped in it myself I really couldn't say.

1323392,5,B00003CXRM,"This film passes almost like a dream - if dreams were spiked with slapstick humor.  It evokes, more powerfully than anything I have ever seen, the essence of an America that is no more.  Which is both a good and a bad thing.

It's a good thing because no one in their right mind would want to go back to the era before the Civil Rights Movement changed the face of the south and put old Jim Crow to rest.

It's a bad thing because television, air conditioning and sealed up cars have basically ended society, and left us with a thin, fragile shell of a community.

In 1930's America, there was nothing to do on a hot summer night but sit on the front porch, drink lemonade, and talk with your neighbors who were out walking, looking for a breeze.

On Saturday, there was nothing to do but go into town with your children and see everyone out walking around downtown, going from store to store on the sidewalk (imagine that...)

On Sunday, you went to the church of your choice, where you tried to worship the Lord over the rustling sound of whispered gossip, some of it about you and yours.

It was a socially tight, often restrictive world; but it was a world that was focused and centered around people relating to each other; not around gameboys, X-boxes, PC's, cellphone IM's, or sitting alone in your house on a beautiful summer night with all the windows down tight, the AC on full blast and the TV making that flickering, eerie blue light in your curtains.

""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" reminds us both of what we are so glad is over, and of what almost all of us miss on some subconscious level in our hearts; the feeling of being a part of a community.",1123459200,8,1660,4.363636363636363
1323393,5,B00003CXRM,"My boyfriend said, ""Sit down and watch this with me"".  I looked at the jacket: three guys from prison. Looked like a dumb guy movie.  But these escapees were funny. (And Everett wasn't any smarter than the other two, he just had a bigger vocabulary.)  I was laughing in no time, but my boyfriend was REALLY laughing. I said, ""I know this is funny, but it's not THAT funny"". ""Oh yes it is, when I lived in Oklahoma, I KNEW people like this.""  Delmar is so sweet, he apologized for everone else's mistakes, and butterflies land on his finger.  Poor Pete, everything bad happens to him.  And Everett keeps saying that this time he really is telling the truth. I am not a fan of ""country music"", but I loved all the songs in this, particularly ""Man of Constant Sorrows"" (OMG, loved the silly dancing they did on stage at the end), and the gravediggers song, so moving.  Some of our favorite lines are:

""We're in a tight spot""

""What line of business are you in? Some of your folding money's come undone.""

""I don't want Fop, G*d-d*mm*t, I'm a Dapper-Dan man.""

""You watch your language young man, this is a family establishment"".

""Yep, they're going to kick our butts"", ""No I think they're going to paddle it""

""And stay out of the Woolsworth!""

And MY favorite: ""Of course it's Pete, LOOK at him!""

I know these are not funny here, but they are really funny in context.

This is not an over the top kind of funny, like Lethal Weapon or Dumb and Dumber, it is a subtle kind of funny, like, ""I can't believe these guys are so serious about how ridiculous they're being.""

I also like that it has a ""restored and colorized"" look to it. It makes you think they are in some kind of fantasy land. And a lot of the smaller parts are played by people with very interesting faces. They are funny just to look at.

I like KKK Scene, it is so reminiscent of when the Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are breaking into the Witche's Castle. And if you read the script, the KKK is signing ""E-I-E-E-I-O, Eenie, Meenin, Miny, Mo"".

Pappy O' Daniel and his Yes Men are too funny too.

I think the best part about this movie is that it all seemed so disjointed and fun, and until you got to the end, you had no idea how everything was interrelated.  It was such a fun, unpredicable surprise.  :)",1118880000,11,2270,4.354761904761904

1323399,5,B00003CXRM,"This depression era period piece is simply a delight.  The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.

That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win.  (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.)  But never mind.  The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.

That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen.  Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996).  Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events.  O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing.  Characters appear, as they are won't to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on.  Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance.  When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.

One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot.  He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees.  With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.

Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen.  He is one of those non-glamourous actors who is at the top of the profession.  It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off.  This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).

This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer.  As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters.  But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor.  He was really that good.  (He did win a Golden Globe award.)

And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick.  When the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" come on with their ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" it really brings the house down.  The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot.  And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow""!

See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.",1111449600,2,3597,4.611635220125786

1323496,3,B00003CXRM,"I saw this movie last Saturday and I think it has one of the most originally amusing scenes to start the film with. The movie has three well defined characters. I'll speak more about them.

The movie recreates the distant past in a way quite extraordinary. I think its a travellor's movie and the three run into a lot of characters. I laughed out loud while watching two scenes in the film. I liked the mini Satan show. Those who've seen the movie just might follow what I said. Enjoyed the Baptism bit and I think the music played throughout the film is quite inspiring and adds to the mood of the movie.

Where the movie lacked was in coming to the conclusion. I wasn't too impressed with the flood scene. The last scene in the film with the blind man on the railway tracks was moving in a way.

Overall, this film is the kind I won't give a second watch anytime in the near future. It made me realise Clooney isn't a bad actor and the character who played ""George Nelson"" was my favourite(short role)though. I liked the cars and cows collision too. Replayed it thrice.

1323502,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie is kick ass! two words GEORGE NELSON. This guy is rightious, if it weren't for him I don't think that I could give this movie five stars! The rest of the charectors are great as well, but in my opinion, George Nelson is on the throwne of great charectors! everytime I watch this movie, I always look forward to the part where the cops are car chasing George Nelson and all of the sudden, George starts shooting the live stock and all this time the cops are a little distance away from Georges car and some cows walk between Georges car and the cop cars and the car in front rams into the cow and I swear the front of the car jumps two or three feet in the air and it just totals the car. Everytime I see that part, I swear I am going to kill my self because I am laughing so hard and I can hardly breathe, let me tell you why I think that part is holarious! because back in 1994 me and my dad were driving out in the backroads in his 1973 ford high boy, we had just barely got done restoring her so she still had some bugs in the engine that we had to work out and she died on us, so my dad's friend came and towed us back to the farm with his 93 ford truck and basically the same thing happened to us, we were a ways from the farm and we were being towed back and this damn cow got right between the two trucks and SLAM we hit that damn cow and literally ran over the damn thing and it hurt like a bitch when we hit the roof. That is why I find that part so funny, because I can't imagine how the cops in that first car felt, plus it brought back some old memories, not to mention the look on george nelsons face, something happened to the cow and the cops which he hates one almost as worse as the other. Another reason why I think it is so funny is because movies don't usually show that anymore and you aren't expecting it and then all of the sudden the car jumps three feet in the air and the cow is laying in front of the car as mangled as the car is. It is kind of sad when you think of the situation and probably to most people that scene is really uncool but if you have ever had that experience, I can promise you that you will laugh your ass off! all in all this movie is totally kick ass, so get home early one night,sit down with your family, get the bowl of popcorn, and grab that bottle of beer and sit back and enjoy the ride",1098403200,7,2352,3.9123173277661794

He gets some fine help from John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, as the three convicts make their escape from a chain gang.

1323574,1,B00003CXRM,"On 18 Feb  04, at 11:30 p.m., I watched the movie O Brother Where Art Thou.  I watched it played on a DVD medium in surround sound.  This film was produced by Touch stone / Universal pictures with help from Studio Canal and Working Title Productions.  The movie was made in 2000 and stared George Clooney in the title role.  His supporting cast was John Turturro and Tim Blake.  This film was presented in color.
  O Brother is a partially modernize story of Odysseus.  In this case the character George Clooney plays is called Ulysses Everett or Everett for shot.  He is on a chain gang and needs to get home.  He convinces his fellow convicts, Pete and Nelson, to escape with him.  Everett says he has stolen a million dollars and needs to get it before the valley he buried it in is flooded.  This will happen in five days, so the unlikely trio races against the clock to get home.
  Along the way the encounter several diversions that try to keep them from getting their prize.  First  the jump a train or at least a few of them do.  However since they are chained together they all fall out of the train.  They need to learn to work together, if they are going to make it to the money in time.
  Next they meet a blind man on a hand cart.  He prophesizes that they will find a treasure, but not the one they seek.  This causes some dissent among the men.  However Everett is able to keep them together and push them on.
  After the encounter with the blind prophet, they run into Pete's Cousin.  Hogwolop turns the three in for the bounty.  The depression is very severe and Hogwolop needs the money to save his farm.  The three are able to escape.
  The boys run into a baptism.  Pete and Nelson get saved but Everett decides not to. The two saved boys are ready to call it quits.  I think this parallels the encounter with the lotus eaters.  Instead of physical pleasure, the boys have a spiritual pleasure.  As such they feel that they have been absolved from sin.  Why should they move on?  Everett pushes them.
  They run into a black guitar player.  He tells them that they can make some money singing into a can.  They cut a record and this act gets them famous.  Even though the Soggy Bottom boys, as they are now called, do not realize it.
  There is an encounter with three women.  When they wake up Pete is gone and the boys think he has been turned into a frog.  Everett pushes them on.
  After the encounter with the three sirens they run into a one eyed bible sales man.  Big Ted tricks them into going out into the woods for lunch.  Then he kills the frog that is Pete, beats up Nelson and Everett  and then robs them.  This is a close parallel to the encounter with the Cyclops in the Odyssey.  After several more adventures they meet the Cyclopes again.  This time they defeat him.  First they attempt to spear his eye with a rebel flag.  But in the end they  land a fiery cross on top of him.
  There is an encounter with a suitor in the later half of the movie.  This time Everett is not the strong one and he gets his but kicked.  He has to learn that an all out attack is hopeless.  So Everett disguises himself and his buddies to sneak into a political rally and see Everett's wife.  The real reason he escaped from jail.  You find out that there is not treasure.  Everett just said that to get his chain boys to leave with him.  His wife is about to get remarried and he will do anything to stop it.  In the end, the boys get a pardon, the get new jobs, and Everett gets the girl.
  As for an evaluation.  I do not like George Clooney.  I think he is an arrogant actor that always seams oily.  As such this tainted my perception of the movie.  But I didn't like it just for Clooney's miserable performance.  No I didn't like it because of all the Yodeling.  I did not care for the time period or the jandra this movie was designed for.  The constant caterwauling was not music.  It was noise.  As such I could not get into the main part of the story.  Their concept that music can save ones soul.
  I am also nit picker when it comes to period concepts in films.  As such I was irritated that a rebel flag was used for the KKK, as their symbol, in the film.  The actual rebel flag was not adopted by the clan until the end of the second world war.  As such it should not have been used at all.  Now IK must say that I thought that their portrayal of the country store was accurate.  It wasn't until the advent of the super market that customers could actually get products themselves off of the shelves.  You needed an attendant.  This was a nice vintage touch.
  This is a modern rendition of the Odyssey.  However, except for a few obvious parts, the sirens and the Cyclops, I couldn't make the connection.  If you can compare O Brother Where Art Thou to The Odyssey then by all means you can compare What Dreams May Come to Dante's Inferno .Like I have stated it was a stretch.  Also I just felt the acting was lack luster and the plot was forced.  All types of little things kept happening to the convicts that pushed them along in the right direction and rewarded them.  These are prisoners.  It is hard to sympathize with them.  Yes you learn that they did their crimes for good causes, but the fact of the matter is the movie was glorifying the prisoner.  This upset me.  We have enough problems now a days without some idiot getting an idea that it is okay to be like baby face nelson and go out in a criminal ball of glory.  Morally I was opposed to this.
  As for the DVD the features were lacking.  I'm used to tons of extras and this DVD had little to offer.  For $15.00 I expect more for my money.  All in all I was extremely disappointed in both the film and the DVD.  I'm glad I only spent $2.62 to rent it.  Even then I felt cheated.

Safe journey:

This is a re-telling of the ""Odyssey"" by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the ""Odyssey"" was about.  In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey.  The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.
Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.
However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack.  It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompnaied the mood and tone.  A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.
The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody.  The soundtrack deserved the kudos it received.

It put my bestfriend to sleep and almost put me to sleep. The story is way to slow with no plot. The acting sucks. The talking scenes are boring and way too long. There is nothing funny about this movie except for the fact that people actually like it. Which I find surprising. The movie is suppose to be about a trio on chain gang who break from prison is 1930's. They are out on the run to treasure. Along the way, they come across many strange people. Who are way too stupid with very low talent or talent. Which makes this movie very unworthy to watch. I give this movie a 3 out of 10.
I'm a HUGE George Clooney fan. I've liked him since seeing him in Return To Horror High in 1987. Just because I don't like this movie, does not mean I'm not a true Clooney fan. A fan does not have to like everything about the person they are a fan of. If there other fans out there who don't like this movie. Please come forward.

1323578,5,B00003CXRM,"Joel and Ethan Coen seem incapable of making a film that isn't at least interesting, and often their movies are absolutely delightful.  I think everyone has their favorites (mine are ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona""), but this film touched a few cultural nerves that are infrequently accessed.
For one thing, the soundtrack features a brilliant collection of grass-roots and Americana music - acoustic blues and jazz and bluegrass.  Alison Krauss, already a novelty around Nashville as a platinum-selling bluegrass artist, received a thunderbolt of a boost to her career by supplying several tunes and vocal parts to the soundtrack (for example singing the Heavenly ""Down to the River to Pray"" during the baptism scene and the seductive voice of one of the sirens later on).  Dan Tyminski, one of the musicians from Alison's band, Union Station, supplies the singing voice of George Clooney and Dan Tyminski's ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" became even MORE of a novelty around Nashville as it won one Country Music Award after another without the benefit of any significant radio play.
The script is VERY loosely based on Homer's Odyssey and knowing that allows the moderately educated a few hearty chuckles recognizing, for example, that John Goodman's Eye-Patched Bible Salesman represents the Cyclops.
George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson deliver the Coen's rib-tickling dialogue with gusto.  I don't know why it's so entertaining to watch characters who are clueless, or at least more clueless than they think they are, but to see three bravura performances as chain-gang refugee dunces is a treat here.
In a typical early sequence our trio has just made their break from the chain-gang and Clooney's Everett begins taking charge.  Turturro's Pete questions him:
""Wait a minute.  Who elected you leader of this outfit?""
Everette responds ""Well, Pete, I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought.  But if that ain't the consensus, then hell, let's put it to a vote.""
""Suits me"", says Pete. ""I'm voting for yours truly.""
""Well, I'm voting for yours truly too"" replies Everett, not backing down.
Pete and Everett turn to their slightly denser partner Delmar to break the deadlocked vote.
He ponders it thoughtfully.""Okay.... I'm with you fellers"".
Classic Coen Brothers.

One tidbit provided on the ""Alison Krauss and Union Station LIVE DVD"": Dan Tyminski, upon learning that he was going to be providing the singing voice for George Clooney, called his wife to give her the exciting news.
""Honey! They're making a movie and I'm doing a voiceover for George Clooney!""
""Oh, that's good, Dan.  What's a voiceover?""
""Well, when people go to see the movie and look up on the screen, they'll see George Clooney, but when he sings it'll be my voice coming out of his mouth!""
""Oh Dan"", Mrs. Tyminski replied. ""That's my fantasy!""",1086739200,6,2883,5.132196162046908
1323579,5,B00003CXRM,"While my favorite Coen brothers' film is ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is my favorite comedy by these two mavericks.
Loosely based on Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" earning an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay even though the Coens' admitted to reading only the Cliff Notes, ""O Brother"" is the Coens' tribute to American bluegrass music.  For some reason, this movie was shamefully snubbed at the Oscars, but George Clooney earned his Golden Globe award for best actor.
Clooney plays the fast-talking Clark Gable wannabe, Ulysses Everett MacGill.  Unfortunately for Ulysses, his mouth runs about five steps ahead of his brain, and his delight in the clever, hyper-articulate use of the English language cannot mask his delightful naivete.  In a performance of sly self-mockery (can you think of another major film star who would so earnestly ask for a hair net to sleep in or speak movingly about being a ""Dapper Dan Man""?), Clooney steals one heck of a show.
Ulysses escapes from a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi with his sidekicks, the hot-blooded Pete (John Turturro) and easy-going Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Allegedly going to find some treasure before a river gets dammed, sinking the treasure beneath a deep lake, this trio begins a bizarre journey across the Deep South.
Along the way they meet guitarist Tommy Johnson, who followed an American musical legend by selling his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for the ability to play the guitar, Big Jim Teague (the Cyclops), three Sirens, a blind seer, Baby Face Nelson, a spelling-challenged rifle-toting youngster, and Governor Pappy O'Daniel (conveniently relocated from Texas to Mississippi).  Recalling the ultimate road story of the Odyssey, ""O Brother"" breezes from episode to episode with delightful ease.
As ever with Coen brothers' films, the movie looks wonderful and feels authentic.  You can feel the oppressive heat of the Mississippi sunshine, you choke on dusty roads, and you glory in the greens and yellows of the languid countryside.  Unlike so many films set in the Old South, characters are fully-realized (even if hilariously flawed) rather than caricatures.  The minor details of daily life in the South (a mild oath from Ulysses gets a stern warning -- ""Watch your mouth, young feller, this is a public shop"") are delightful touches.
Of course, the true star of this movie, other than Clooney, is the soundtrack.  Almost solely responsible for the recent Bluegrass explosion, ""O Brother"" lovingly grounds this musical genre in its appropriate time and space, and the songs form a perfect accompaniment to the rest of the movie.  When the congregation sings is gospel tunes, or Pappy O'Daniel leads the Soggy Bottom Boys (what a name!) in a rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine,"" the powerful force of music resonates throughout this delightful film.
One of the best movies of recent years, it's hard to understand why ""O Brother"" was so snubbed by the Academy.  Like other recent snubs (e.g., ""Shawshank Redemption,"" this movie is sure to generate more critical acclaim as it ages.
Whether it's for the wonderful acting, terrific writing, or amazing soundtrack, ""O Brother"" should be in your collection!",1083888000,11,3228,5.1529636711281075
1323580,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie in my eyes parallels the best movies in all times.  From the characters, to the time and plot. This movie is perfect in all aspects. Watching this movie and reading The Odyssey fit together as well as Pink Floyd and The Wizard of Oz. To Coen Brothers have produced yet another piece of exquist art with O Brother, Where Art Thou?, taking a book and reproducing it in a ""modern"" time that many people can relate to. Having these characters go through more realistic hardships instead of mythological beasts and hardships. In my opinion, O Brother is a most excellent film....I give it 5 Stars.",1081987200,5,603,4.635514018691588
1323581,5,B00003CXRM,"Joel and Ethan, the inimitable and unstoppable Coen brothers, score yet again. It's an over-the-top funny - and touching - movie about three cons on the run in Mississippi in the 30s. George Clooney, playing  dapper Ulysses Everett McGill, is the thinker, the planner, the schemer, of the impossible trio. He's slick, quick-talking, and funny as hell.
John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play the two side-kicks, dumbos who go along for the ride and add comic bits to the action as the runaways encounter every possible sort of human as obstacles in their path. There's a blind man, a one-eyed crook, sexy singing girls, a Blues guitarist, crooked politicians (is there any other kind?), and so forth.
And the soundtrack is so incredibly good that you'll want to go right out and buy it - as I did - and I don't even like country. But this is foot-stompin' banjo-banging, twangy bluegrass stuff that's totally infectious.
If you haven't yet seen it, SEE IT NOW.",1074902400,52,960,4.783132530120482
1323663,5,B00003CXRM,"After The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers refined their approach to movie-making. They stuck with the idea of including any idea that was funny and slightly strange, but this time they imposed a plot that made sense. Like Fargo --- which was supposed to be based on a true story but really wasn't --- Oh Brother Where Art Thou is based on the Odyssey (a seemingly true story that they could use when it served them, or dump when it didn't). Then they  added the Depression, southern politics, and lots of music.
If this had been written and directed by anyone else, it would have been a mess. But with the Coen brothers, it's a musical comedy disguised as a screwball period piece. It helps that the casting is perfect. From the three principal actors to the major secondary characters (like John Goodman's Big Dan Teague/Cyclops) to the smaller parts (like the governor's two dim-bulb campaign managers and the radio station owner) every actor is funny and perfectly in sync with the tone of the film.
The Coens added quite a bit of computer effects and all of it works. The obvious example is the color-grading. The short documentary on the DVD shows how computers were used to wash out colors and tint different scenes. Then there are small parts, such as the underwater shot of Dapper Dan cans and a dog floating  by. Those cans are computer-generated, and the dog was composited into the shot. You don't notice this stuff until the third or fourth time you see it. Once you notice, it makes the movie even better.
This is one of the best Coen brothers movies, and one of the best movies of the last 10 years. The music is so good, you'll be humming every tune the day after you see it. It's very funny and beautifully designed, as well.",1071014400,6,1741,4.559105431309904
1323664,5,B00003CXRM,"There really is nobody in mainstream American cinema to touch the Coen Brothers. Young aspiring screenwriters must look at most big Hollywood movies and think, Oh gee, I could write better than that so easily. Then they must look at what the Coens write and think, Oh gee, I could never write like that. As screen writers, the C. Bros are giants in a race of pygmies.
At the heart of their work are three of the finest films ever made in the United States, made consecutively, ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and this. One of the glorious things about these three films is how different they are. ""Fargo"" is a police procedural and morality tale set in the snowbound backwater of Minnesota, ""Big Lebowski"" a glorious send up of film noir set in the asinine wilderness of Los Angeles. ""Oh Brother"" is a musical epic, an enchantment, set in Depression era Mississippi. If the idea here is to signal which movies are not simply worth seeing but specifically worth buying, where a movie worth buying is a movie that will delight not just on a single viewing but repeatedly, on viewing it again and again, all these three movies are eminently worth singling out. I've seen them all several times now and they just get better.  Many movies get to be classics because of just one or two scenes that have some peculiar magic. This movie is composed almost entirely of such scenes.
In essence it's a comedy and seems to spring from an almost infinite well of comic invention. Here we get George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talking ""Odysseus"" character with his loquacity and vanity, John Goodman as Big Dan Teague, the one-eyed ""Cyclops"" (with an neat pun on that word's murky second life as a term for a KKK officeholder) bible salesman and thief, Michael Badalucco as George ""Baby Face"" Nelson the manic depressive cow-hating bank robber, Stephen Root as the strangely manic blind recording engineer and radio station manager in the middle of nowhere, Wayne Duvall as Homer Stokes the KKK-affiliated candidate for governor with his performing midget, Charles Durning  as Menelaus ""Pappy"" O Daniel, the incumbent governor, terrified of losing, Holly Hunter as Mrs ""Penelope"" McGill who has told her army of children that her fallen ex-husband was run over by a train, Ray McKinnon as her suitor who, inverting the Homeric source, is more than a match for Everett in a bout of fisticuffs,  Lee Weaver as the ""Tiresias"" character, the blind driver of a handcar, and Daniel von Bargen as an avenging angel, the sheriff, who is also at once The Devil and the Greek God Neptune. All the above act like people who never expect to be offered a better-written part and many of them never will. Quite good comic films could be made from one twentieth of the cinematic ideas on display here. The Coens just have such an abundance of them, they toss them off, exult briefly in them, and them move gaily on to the next. If there's one quibble, it might be Pete and Delmar, McGill's companions, who have escaped with him from a chain gang. While Walter Sobchak in ""The Big Lebowski"" was not merely an idiot but a magnificent, outrageous idiot of Dickensian dimensions, these two, though certainly well enough acted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, are much closer to being stock comic characters whose plain unembellished dumbness is intended to render them funny. If ""Big Lebowski"" is a better comic film, as I think it is, I'd single that out as a reason why.
As well as the Coen's, the movie's magnificence owes a large debt to T Bone Burnett who put the music together. It's very much a musical and the soundtrack is pure heaven to listen to, especially those items involving the marvellous singing of Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. Though if there is one slightly off note here too, it is Ralph Stanley's ""O Death"" sung by a hooded KKK chief who turns out to be Stokes. Not only is credulity strained in supposing Stokes could have a singing voice remotely like Stanley's but it seems far too cool a song to be found on the lips of so desperately uncool a character. But again now I'm splitting hairs. This is a classy, classy movie and a pure joy to watch.",1070841600,12,4163,4.676671214188268

1323666,5,B00003CXRM,"Best movie ever, in my opinion.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I'm no fan of George Clooney, but in this movie he was awesome!  And don't be fooled by the title- I thought it was a Shakespearean movie, but it's actually set in the Deep South in the 1920s or so.
The Coen brothers' screenplay is genius, flawlessly combining elements of Homer's Odyssey and the history of the Deep South (I especially liked ""servant of the little man"" and ""who made the color guard colored?"").  The three main characters- Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro- are all very good and extremely different.  The movie is full of hilarity from beginning to end, straddling the line between fantasy and reality without ever becoming ludicrous.  Half the fun consists of how gross all the characters look/act (but in a funny way), as well as the strange pronunciations (you might want to turn on subtitles in order to understand some of the dialogue).  The other half lies in the absolutely brilliant screenplay, filled with unexpected twists and turns at every juncture.
Today's comedies are so often full of either cheap, lowbrow gags or overly dark humor.  This movie has neither, and furthermore contains a number of wonderful historical and mythical references- glued together by stunning performances from all actors involved.  I've watched this movie again and again, and it never loses its charm.  Some of the later scenes involving Holly Hunter (as the nasty ex-wife) are not particularly funny and, in my opinion, inferior to the rest of the piece.  Nevertheless, this picture is the best comedy I have ever seen.  See it now if you haven't already!",1070668800,2,1645,4.85663082437276
1323667,3,B00003CXRM,"I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (""Fargo""), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.
""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a retelling of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" or ""Homer's Odyssey,"" since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing?
It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. ""I'm a Dapper Dan Man!"" he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.
The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.
Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.
The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.
I've read ""The Odyssey,"" but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least ""The Odyssey"" was weird for a reason - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" could certainly do without the strangeness.
Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.
The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in ""Fargo,"" the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.
The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to ""Fargo."" Maybe I just wanted something better. So with last night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.
""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than ""Fargo,"" which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" was different than ""The Sixth Sense"" in a delightfully splendid way, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended ""Star Wars"" series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better.",1070323200,3,4698,4.54127358490566

As a born-again Christian I would naturally shy away from a movie that uses the Lord's name in vain, but as my Pastor explained it's just a vehicle to make fun of a ""Christian"" culture that has the language without the transforming power of the Spirit.  I really don't get to watch many films because I just don't trust Hollywood, but this picture seems different to me.  While making fun of the Southern ""Christian"" culture, it seems to say that there is a reality behind the fake.  The movie is full of gospel tunes and great music.

However, he is still shackled to his two chain-mates from the chain gang - the bad tempered Pete ( John Turturo)and the sweet and dimwitted Delmar ( Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing else to lose, the trio sets off in search of buried treasure that will help them all start new lives. Everett claims that he stole and buried over one million dollars in cash. The only problem is that they only have four days to find it before it is lost forever at the bottom of a reservoir. But as luck would have it, they keep running into strange situations, and even stranger people. The trio steals a car, and eventually pick up a guitar playing hitchiker. To make some extra money, they stop at a radio station and pose as a music group called ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"". The record that they cut soon becomes the hottest record in the reigon. However, the adventure does not stop there, as they encounter many more strange characters that include : a blind prophet, a bank robber ( Michael Badalucco), a crooked one-eyed bible salesman ( John Goodman), and Everet's ex-wife ( Holly Hunter)who is about to get re-married. This crazy adventure filled with close calls, near misses, and betrayals will have you laughing every step of the way.
Oh man, what an oustanding film. This film succeeds on so many levels. The first is the story itself. Watching the three run into one thing after the next will keep you entertained for the entire film. Next, is the amazing cast. George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturo are all spectacular in their roles. All three are extremely different, but will make you laugh the same. The supporting cast is quite good as well as features performances by Holly Hunter, Michael Badalucco, John Goodman, and Charles Durning. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the amazing soundtrack. It features a wide variety of different artists and each song is spectacular. Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on ""I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow"". This is the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features : Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch.
The acting is spectacular, the music is amazing, the story is extremely well rounded, and it is down right hillarious. The DVD is outstanding.

1323732,2,B00003CXRM,"When I saw ""Fargo"" a few years back, I was thoroughly unimpressed. But so many people claimed its virtues, I began wondering if I'd just been in a bad frame of mind at the time.  Having now seen  ""Oh Brother,"" by the same filmmakers, I know my impression of ""Fargo"" was no mistake.  ""Oh Brother"" suffers from many of the same problems.
Both films overwhelmingly rely on trite and shallow stereotypes of people (Fargo-Upper Midwesterners;  Brother-Southerners) for their humor-such as it is.  ....  It's one thing to laugh at human foibles, it's another to make disparaging characterizations the central focus of the film-especially when there's little else to commend.
""Oh Brother"" skips along, illogically, with subplots that appear and disappear without any development and, often, without connection.  For example, three escaped cons and a guitar player they meet on the road, hornswoggle their way on to a radio broadcast singing a highly polished rendition of ""Man of Constant Sorrow""-although their connection to music up to that point in the film is non-existent.
Later, they happen upon three sultry young women (Sirens) in the woods.  The possibilities look good for our three cons when (poof!) two are now on the ground, waking-the third gone.  No clue as to what happened in between.  Kirk Douglas made us live, vividly, through every moment of his encounter with Sirens.  ""Oh Brother"" by contrast, doesn't bother with such details.  It's enough to say, ""We met `em--let's move on to the next scene.""  And don't forget the corn pone.
Elsewhere, filmgoers are treated to a train, a mass baptism, a Ku Klux Klan rally, a bank robbery, a swindling Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, hound dogs and a sheriff with mirrored-glasses.  Get the connection?  Hee haw!
""Oh Brother"" has been widely associated with a resurgence or discovery of bluegrass music, the soundtrack selling millions.  I, therefore, expected music to be at the forefront of the film.  It isn't really (contrast with ""The Blues Brothers""--where good music is at the fore and the plot is discernible).
There are couple of nice bluegrass moments, however.  In one, a group of people are singing as they walk toward a baptismal pool.  In the other, The Whites are on a stage, looking as if they might be the Carter family (the film is set in the 30s)--singing ""Sunny Side of the Mountain.""  But these moments, unfortunately, are short and they don't make up for the rest of the film.
I'm puzzled at the connection of this film with bluegrass for one of the things that makes this type of music attractive is its authenticity.  Bluegrass and old-time country is heartfelt, simple music, shorn of pretense and connected with the lives of real people.  But there's nothing at all authentic about ""Oh Brother,"" the film.  In fact, it's almost as if the film is mocking the music.  I was sorely disappointed to hear Ralph Stanley's voice (in its only appearance) coming out from behind a Ku Klux Klan hood.
Based on the film, the music on the soundtrack is probably pretty good.  But don't expect the film to be a representation of the spirit of that music.",1058572800,5,3126,4.908571428571428

George Clooney does one of his better film performances in this movie (second to Ocean's 11 perhaps) but it is the plethora of supporting characters and cast that help make this ancient story come to life. If for the sound track alone this movie deserves a recommendation, but I believe that even without its amazing soundtrack, it would be a phenomenal success.",1056585600,2,946,4.739393939393939
1323735,3,B00003CXRM,"The three star rating for this movie is a relative rating.  By most standards, this is a pretty decent movie; by Coen movie standards, comparing it to ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo,"" it doesn't quite come up to snuff.
Very very very loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey"" (the Coens admit that they have never read Homer), this movie feels more like a series of vignettes, only marginally connected to each other, loosely strung together.  Some of the scenes, such as the revival down at the river, really don't seem to make much sense and do little to advance the storyline.  Compared to some of the excellently constructed scripts of the other Coen movies, this plotline meanders considerably.  As the movie approaches its conclusion, the plot becomes increasingly contrived in an effort to tie all the loose ends together.
That being said, this is nonetheless an extremely enjoyable movie with some great lines (I don't want Fop, goddammit, I'm a Dapper Dan Man!) and engaging characters.  Also, the soundtrack is simply top-notch.  At times, I suspected that the Coens fell in love with bluegrass and crafted this movie just as an excuse to put together a good movie soundtrack.
This was a fun movie to watch --- I guess I have just been spoiled by the very high quality of the other Coen films.",1055203200,,1291,4.792792792792793

The combination of the excellent screenplay, great director, good actors and the music that you cannot forget never ever made this filt the one of the best movies ever produced.  I felt as I was picked by this movie, swirled around, taken to different places and than dropped on my head.  And, I was happy.  This movie made me happy.

1323737,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie is by far one of the all-time best movies ever made.  Joel Coen does an excellent job of translating Homer's ""Odyssey"" into a modern-day (well, Depression-era US) story, while keeping the audience entertained and riveted to the screen.
Our story starts with Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete, and Delmar off to find ""the treasure"", which is supposed to be $1 million dollars.  ""1.2, to be exact.""  But our boys soon find themselves mixed up in all kinds of adventures, from being ""in a tight spot"", to ""singing in a can"", to finding out Everett has been hit by a train and his wife's new beau (""He's a suitor!"") to being ""bona fide"".
This movie really has it all - a great musical soundtrack, outstanding acting, good storyline, and, most importantly, a happy ending.  What else could a guy want out of a movie?  Explosions?  Yes, even in this movie will you find a police truck filled with ammo exploding at a farmhouse.

1323822,5,B00003CXRM,"I was pleasantly suprised at this movie, especially the fact that George Clooney can sing.  I got a kick out of the song he sang with ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"".  Clooney has such a wide range of talent.
Unlike his recent release, the remake of the 1972 classic ""Solaris"" was a lot more intense, but very good.  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is lighter and less taxing drama-wise.  This by no means makes any of these movies any less enjoyable.
For one thing, Clooney's character is not without flaws.  He lies, cheats, and steals to get what he wants. Also, he loves to grease his hair.  It's not until his ex-wife decides to marry another man that he discovers what is really important.  In spite of his rather charming nature he still manages to be fooled by a shapely body feeding him moonshine in scantily clad, wet clothing while she harmonizes with two others of the same body type.
The amazing thing about Clooney's character is he mamages to stay a few leagues ahead of the athorities.  Even when things look bleak, he manages to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

A co-worker absolutly hated it.  Couldn't get through watching it even once.  I guess it all depends on you sense of humor.  It needs to be pretty off-the-wall to enjoy subtlties like in this movie.

My friend said that it was his wife's favorite movie and they had watched the DVD so many times that now he had begun to like it a lot too. I got a copy and was caught up in the story right away. The cast of characters are almost cartoon-like in their simplicity but the actors play them with energy and creativity. Clooney's star power comes through but he doesn't dominate the film. Instead, he come across exactly as he should - as a man who has survived on his charm and not his wits. The masterful way the music is used as a unifying force worked very well for me (I bought the CD as well). Without the outstanding music score, the movie would not have been as appealing. It is making the rounds on cable these days and when I scan past it, I hang in there for a while because the acting is so good and each scene is photographed beautifully.

John Turturro, who you may remember from ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Quiz Show"" adds humor as the character of Pete, and even John Goodman (who recently did the voice of Sully in ""Monsters, Inc."") made a small appearance in this film.  Playing the man who is engaged to marry Everett's ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) is none other than Ray McKinnon, who, in 2002, won an Academy Award for his short fim ""The Accountant""

""Brother"" just comes alive in your mind as you watch it!  The brilliant writing and direction, the genius camera work, the dead-on charicatures, all of it comes together and sucks you in to the Coen's off-kilter world.  Clooney is a natural for the silver-tongued Ulysses, and Pete and Delmar are perfectly cast - every subtle shift in their simple thought process is clearly written on their face.

1323828,5,B00003CXRM,"Don't take my word for it; read the other five-star reviews.  They cover just about all of my observations well and there's no need to repeat them. I am in my 70's and remember the great depression well. It was another world that this flick depicts accurately, albeit without all of the intense sorrow that also went with those hard times.  Judging from the automobiles and events depicted in this film it was set in 1938, give or take a year. It brought back many personal memories.
There really was a Governor ""pappy"" Lee O'daniel who was associated with a flour company and a country music group, but the real one was governor of Texas (not Mississippi) from 1939 through 1941, defeating Lyndon Johnson. I can still remember Lee O'Daniel's Light Crust Doughboys on the radio every evening.  The catch phrase in their bumper music was ""Please pass the biscuits, pappy.""
Casting in the film was perfect. Many locals were undoubtedly used because no actor could depict the country characters so authentically. The music was as it really sounded back then.  It was refreshing to escape to the real thing without today's slick and professionally perfect plastic sounds. The songs were truly representative of the era, as I remember it.
This is a relaxing, refreshing, no-think film that works well on many levels. Every time you see it you see something you missed on previous viewings.  I completely missed its esoteric parody of Homer's Odyssey the first two times.
If you are in the mood for a fast moving, outrageosuly funny comedy that doesn't require delving into heavy, dark, brooding, depressing, and stressful psychological concepts, then this is the film for you. Even the manic-depressive behavior of ""Babyface"" Nelson was depicted in an hilarious manner.
This film consists of many sub-plots, all masterfully woven together into a coherent string, each serving as a vehicle for great comedy and wonderful country music as it was played, sung, and heard in the 1930's. I can't praise this film enough. It should have received many top awards, but we all know that awards are based on advertising budgets and Hollywood politics, not quality of the craft.
See this film once and you will want your own copy to view over and over again.  The kids will also love it.",1041379200,3,2271,4.870466321243524

I am a great fan of John Hartford and was told this is his last project, so I expected to be ""wined and dined"" by the quality of the sountrack. It wasn't up to par and didn't get me running out to by a CD.  But don't stop here -- read on to obtain suggestions for CDs to include in your library.
The characters are quirky and the somewhat forgettable, but I enjoyed it while it was on the screen.  There were some side-slappin' times and one of the few films that could bring this generation of movie-goers to visit the Great Depression.  For that reason alone, I give it three stars.
I hope younger folks will turn to their parents or grandparents to learn about their own stories of this unforgettable time in our country's history.  Perhpas even the ""coolest"" of kids will secretly be tapping their toe to a sound that is much of white America's dreams and struggles.
**** for the effort to show our humble years in the depression.  Hartford himself would have been a great character for this film, but I have since learned of his illness during its' inception.
Don't just go away with a cute story in your mind though.  Check out ""Mark Twang"" or ""Steam Powered Areoplane"" by John Harford (once famous for the song ""Gentle on My Mind""); or pay the price for the three disc compilation called ""Will The Circle Be Unbroken.""

Everyone I know is singing the songs, from my 92 year old mother to my 3 year old granddaughter. It might actually revive the art of 3-part harmony.

Everyone in it looks like he's having the time of his life. I can't look at Tim Blake Nelson w/o laughing, & his singing voice is beguiling. George Clooney is PERFECT, Charles Durning is stupendous, Holly Hunter is--as always-- marvelous, and I think the guy who plays the blind manager of WEZY & that unforgettable woman in the bank who whispers, ""That's Baby Face Nelson"", deserve a new category of Oscars: ""Best One-Minute-or-Less Performance"".

I love the women's shapeless feedsack dresses & faces w/o makeup. I love the baptismal procession to ""Down in the River to Pray"" (best song in the movie, though that's a close one). I love the crazy mixed-up chronology w/Pappy O'Daniel (beloved former governor of Texas) & his Lightcrust Doughboys metamorphosed into governor of Mississippi & his Farina band. I love the three cons' ""deus ex machina"" escapes from pursuers, I love the many insightful commentaries on human nature like Clooney's shortlived religiosity.

This brilliant movie (Joel and Ethan Coen, director and writer brothers, made Blood Simple and other great movies) does not explain much to the viewer, but gives you time to enjoy the adventures of these simple minded guys. And that's where Relax! comes in - there's no need to hurry to the plot because there isn't one. After half an hour I started to suspect that this is the truth, no plot? And shortly after that I realized: no problem because it's just a lot of fun. It is a crazy story, with crazy guys. Beautifully shot, nice performances and great props.

It is not just a skillfull movie, but also a witty and intelligent movie. I don't want to sound like a sycophant for saying that, but I really think it is.
It has a ""happy-go-luck"" attitude as to its subject matter. It is, ostensibly, a modern version of The Odyssey, and it does spoof the Odyssey in an intelligent and somewhat credible (but most importantly, funny) manner, but it is much more than that.
Some people have said it was just about laughing at rednecks, but I would say that's only the first level. The two themes I see as most important in that movie are its spoofing of the Odyssey, and skepticism/freethought (especially about religion), as exemplified by the main character.
This movie is definitively enjoyable. It was nominated for two Oscars, but is evidently too much of an intelligent movie to have actually gotten any. If you are smarter than an Oscar judge, you will love this movie.",1031702400,2,1148,4.6600985221674875

I haven't read all of the 460 Amazon customer reviews, but has anyone mentioned the obvious homage to the ""Wizard of Oz"" in the KKK rally scene?  Both films have their 3 heroes perched above
a scene filled with militaristic marching troops (who, in the ""Wizard"", were chanting the dreaded ""Oh-ee-oh"" tune!), and plotting to resuce someone by disguising themselves and infiltrating the march.

1323919,5,B00003CXRM,"What the Coen brothers have created here is a film that is going to last. It quickly made it into my list of top ten movies. It's the Depression-era story of three escaped convicts and their journey to redemption. And along the way they face many trials and tribulations. It's no wonder the story is such a good one, since the film is based on Homer's classic poem, The Odyssey (which the Coen brothers claim to never have read. I don't know that I believe them, but I suppose they could have read the Cliff's Notes).  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson do a fabulous job as the leads. And John Goodman and Holly Hunter have wonderful supporting roles. The music in this film takes on the aspect of a character. And while I wouldn't call this a musical, song occurs and affects what is going on--and it occurs in the logical places instead of the characters just breaking into song whenever. In fact, I think the soundtrack made a bigger splash than the film (but give it time, I think that people will begin to realize the importance of this film soon enough). Color and the visual style of the film also takes on the aspects of being its own character. I know that the entire film was put through a digital workshop in order to give it the visual feel the Coen brothers wanted. This movie is destined to be one of the all time greats.
Unfortunately the dvd doesn't contain a commentary by the Coens or the stars. It is a shame, because I think a Coen commentary would have helped to round out this dvd perfectly. There is a behind the scenes featurette and a featurette that discusses the post-production digital process, both of which are good. There is a menu option that allows you to compare the storyboard with the completed scene (of the Klan scene and the final scene). And finally there is the ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" music video that helps to complete the dvd. It's a charming video.

Tommy Johnson, who has sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for the ability to play, really play, that guitar.

I also enjoyed the portrayal of human nature, especially in connection with Christianity. Although the salvation and subsequent baptism of two of the main characters was admittedly quite shallow, the foolishness and hypocrisy of the third character was clearly shown, as in the end he winds up praying for a miracle, receives it, and then attributes it to physical forces apart from God's control. This is certainly a foolish action by the character, but the Coen brothers expressed it as foolishness, for which I am grateful.

There are drawbacks, however. Since the movie is based on Homer's epic, the Odyssey, the producers had to insert a scene with the famous Sirens. They are by the water in skimpy, wet clothing, and seduce the three men. I would recommend fast-forwarding through this part. Also various unbiblical assumptions about the family and women are assumed in the actions of some of the characters, but they are really quite laughable, and I think the movie is still worth watching despite them.",1030838400,2,1238,4.862559241706161

The pinch-hit group do just okay, and I'm not slamming their artistry, but their music was not what I'd expected or paid for. At least Ms. Welch's acting cameo stayed in.
I wish they'd checked the copyright wonks and IP lawyers at the door when they did the DVD.

You don't have to love the Coen Brothers to love this movie, although it wouldn't hurt.  Anyone familiar with the 'exploding man' in Raising Arizona or the 'evil woodgrinder' in Fargo will realize that there has to be *something* twisted coming in this one.  When it does come, it's pretty tame, but by then you're hooked.
It's hard to find any fault.  Clooney is perfect as the loquacious and fussy Ulysses.  Goodman ditto as Cyclops.  Durning ditto as the slummin' southern governor.  Holly Hunter as Penelope doesn't get much screen time, but she makes the most of what she does get.  And then of course there's the music, which is just too good to be true.
The only thing that bothered me at all was that the brothers didn't 'bring me along gently' into the style of this particular story.  In Fargo, you don't realize what you're in for till it's too late.  In Raising Arizona the plot has you hooked early enough so you have to put up with the gore.  There's no similar 'upward path' in this.  Bang, five minutes into it, there's Clooney spouting his effortless and greasy brand of codswallop, and I found myself going ""This is supposed to be FUNNY?""
Well, yeah, it was, and in fact, once you get used to it, it IS.  In fact, I haven't laughed this loud or this long since SLEEPER.  By the end I was so wound up in the Coen's brand of madcap humor that even the swimming dog scene put me into stitches.  Even such an unlikely subject as a roll-top desk turns out to be a screamer.

The art direction, production design, and set design all perfectly capture the ambiance of Mississippi in the 1930s, and the casting, from George Clooney on down to the smallest roles, is superb.  It is fanciful, funny, and sometimes even touching.  I think this film is already a comedy classic.  And then, of course, there is the music.  The soundtrack has become a hit in its own right.

My first reaction to it was - `what the heck is this?' and then when I watched it again last night - for the fourth time - I found it very entertaining, strange, humorous and definitely mesmerizing in parts.
It's got everything, weirdness, action, adventure, strangeness and lots of very difficult performances. George Clooney leads the ensemble with appearances by Charles Durning and John Goodman. The films tells the story of three convicts from the 30's escaping their prison sentence but with the problem of finding a large amount of money hundreds miles away. Two of the convicts are not so bright and George, although seemingly a person who is well read, is somewhat out of tune with reality.

1324007,5,B00003CXRM,"Just when I thought that no movie could ever come close to the hilarity of The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers release this film, and prove me dead wrong.
O Brother is one of those films that will have you laughing til you puke blood. I, for one, can't get enough of the gubernatorial candidates - whether it's Homer ""Soyvant(sic) of the Little Man"" Stokes or Menelaus ""Pass The Biscuits"" Pappy O'Daniel. All of the film's characters stick to memory like glue - Delmar, Wash and Pete Hogwallop, and Everett - there really is no role in this film that's insignificant.
If DVD's were at all like video tapes, the underside of my disc would probably be all scratched by now.
It's difficult to describe how funny this film truly is - you will probably understand only if you already have seen some other Coen Brothers films. But I can't commend this film enough - let me just say that every person should see it at least once - just be ready to laugh until you pass out.
In conclusion, I should add that the soundtrack to this film is also excellent. Chock full of classic American folk and bluegrass, it truly is one of the best soundtracks ever made.",1027641600,,1148,4.4714285714285715
1324008,4,B00003CXRM,"FILM:  O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a great comedy set in the dust bowl-era Mississippi starring George Clooney. The film really captures a unique and timeless feeling and combines that with a great plot and heaps of humor. This movie is a somewhat-unknown wonder that is steadily rising in popularity- rightfully! I liked this quality movie with great acting and direction so much that I bought it on DVD after renting it. I would give this four and a half stars if possible.
SPECIAL FEATURES:  The special features on this DVD are disappointing, the only one that stands out being ""Painting with Pixels"", a suprisingly interesting look at how Mississippi was changed from looking deep green in the summer to dry, barren dust bowl-era autumn. Everything else is very average, and the ""behind the scenes"" segment borders on boring.",1027123200,2,832,4.935714285714286

I have two words for these reviewers picking this movie apart....CHILL OUT!... Just enjoy the movie for what it is, a light hearted, deep south comedy!
If your a TRUE southerner, and enjoy shows like ""The Andy Griffith Show"" with southern humor, this is a must have!!  Its one of those movies you'll watch over and over again!",1026950400,3,628,4.513274336283186
1324010,3,B00003CXRM,"The ideas behind this movie were wonderful. I mean, who would have thought of making a modern version of Homer's work The Odyssey to fit a group of criminals in the early 1900s. Our hero must go through many of the parallels of a Mythological epic, namely a one eyed prophet, beautiful Sirens, and continual problems with the ""gods."" The three convicts get separated and try to reunite; the hero's journey (George Clooney) is characterized by bad luck, mistiming, and encounters with both good and evil individuals. What makes this a unique film is the humor that adds in to the serious plot, such as the hero's believe that one of his friends has, in fact, been turned into a frog.
I thought it was a little over-the-top in the soundtrack department, however. We really didn't need song after song after song. One or two would have sufficed. It took away from the flow of the story, and made the movie tend to drag a little.
A 3 and a half stars is about the rating I would give this film. I think it is better than average movie, but still has its flaws. Still, it is a movie I would recommend overall because it concieves a very original idea and goes with it. It is a movie that is willing to take a chance on making a serious and revered work into a modern adventure.",1026864000,,1272,4.3940677966101696

1324069,5,B00003CXRM,"From beginning to the end, this movie is a hoot!
The story is loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey. George Clooney is Ulysses. who is trying to go home to his wife. On the way he has adventures. The Sirens call. Those three women washing clothes in the water are  the Sirens. John Goodman is the Cyclops, the one eyed monster. Clooney's wife is Penelope. The blind man on the handcar on the train track is Homer.
I have watched this movie three times in three weeks. It makes me feel good.
Notice the order of the scenes: day, night, day, night, day, no night, day, night, day, night, and day.
In the first half of the movie, the three men fear the day. They have escaped the chain gang and they do not want to be recognized. They are more comfortable in the night in the woods around the camp fire.
In the second half of the movie, the three men are more comfortable in the daytime. The fires at night have become torches of evil. The night scene of white robed and white hooded white men dancing in the woods by a burning  cross is a deep American nightmare.
And the music! The songs are so deeply American. The songs make me sad, make me sleepy, make me cry, make me laugh, make me stamp my feet and stick my fingers in my mouth to whistle as loud as I can.
That may be why this movie attracts me so. The scenes are icons of such deep American imagery.: chain gangs, apple pie cooling in the window, flat farmland, model T Fords,  burning crosses,  lynch mobs, etc.
I repeat, this movie makes me feel good. Every image is uniquely American . The music is uniquely American.  It makes me feel good to be American.

1324070,5,B00003CXRM,"In O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Cohen Brothers have given us a joyful pageant of incredible wit, unforgettable characters, and indescribable music. The film takes place in a mythical South during the Great Depression, where the Klan lynches with impunity, politicians campaign with midgets, and the best way to get a car is through grand theft auto. Everett, a long winded man addicted to one brand of hair gel, has broken out of jail with the men he was, by chance, chained to: Pete, trusting and loyal, and Delmar, dull, yet kind-hearted. Together, they set out across the land, to reach the treasure that Everett had stolen before a dam flooded the land where it was buried. But that is just the pretext. Along the way, there are baptisms, arguments, a betrayal or two, near lynching, the sale of souls, and an end encounter with the sherriff... and something more. I won't say who, but keep your ears open. It is wonderfully subtle, but when you know who he truly is... It's powerful. That subtle hint is one of the many signs of genius present throughout this film.
Of course, the singing is justifiably one of the best known and best loved parts of the film. Although Disney seems to have currently stepped out of the ring, O Brother proves that musicals are still a delightful form of movie. From the opening credits and ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"", to the haunting rendition of ""Oh, Death"" at the Klan Rally, up until the prophet's singing of ""Angel Band"" as he rolls toward the horizon
The characters are rich, one and all. Everett's commentary on why a blind man with no name would have trouble finding work, Delmar's remark that while Pete would be 84 when leaving prison, ""I'll only be 82."" , and Pete's apologizing to God before betraying his friends, reflect wonderful characters rare to find in any medium, created in a labor of love . And not just the main ones: from the incompetent election officials, to George Nelson, each character becomes unforgettable, instead of the vague stereotype all too common in films.
As for the wit... well, as Pappy O'Daniel says, there's no accounting for taste. But from Delmar's repetitive offering of a roasted gopher to Everett to the exclamation in the midst of the haunting Klan rally that ""The color guard is colored!"" the rich dialogue and wonderful sight gags (i.e. the sheer amount of Dapper Dan Everett uses, seen at the end) lighten the darkest scene, and further show the honed Craft of the Cohen's
In short, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a joy of a film. With a rich world brought to life, it is one of the finest films to grace the silver screen.",1026345600,5,2613,4.658008658008658

After releasing a modern day classic with ""THE BIG LEBOWSKI"", the Coens then gave us the depression era comedy ""O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?"". With the Coens you never know what to expect, but you know it will always be a well made movie that gets better with repeat viewings. This movie ranks in the Coens top 3 behind ""FARGO"", and just ahead of ""RAISING ARIZONA"". The movie has top notch performances from John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Charles Durning, and if you ask me a very Oscar worthy turn by George Clooney. One of the Coen brothers great talents is too paint a great picture of when and where the story is taking place, and this movie falls right in line. Set in the heart of the Mississippi during the depression, Clooney and his partners in crime travel thru absolutely beautiful delta land in search of their goal. Just watching it makes me want to sip on an ice cold lemonade, no kiddin'. The film transfer and colors are excellent on this release. Basicly, you've got a great movie with great performances, but this all actually takes a back seat to the best part of the movie, the music. Leave it up to the Coens to bring roots music back to the to the attention of music fans everywhere. The music is great, fits right in with the story, and the sound on this disc is perfect. Definetly no complaints with the movie, a must see. The disc includes a cool but not long enough featurette, post production process, the Soggy Bottom Boys music video, theatrical trailer, and a very interesting script to storyboard feature.

It came on tv about 2 weeks ago, and since I sat down and watched it that first time, I've bought the dvd and watched it about 10 times over. Usually PG-13 movies don't do much for me, but when a movie comes along with a great story, great characters, and great writing and directing, its destined for....well, greatness. This movie deserved at least one Oscar, and in my opinion, O Brother is a better, more enjoyable movie than The Coen Brothers' other success, Fargo. This movie has the same cooky style to it, focusing on a culture and region, and exaggerating that. Fargo made hilarious the already wacky accent of Minnesotans, this time around the Coens' made hilarious the already wacky lingo of the south, and bringing light to a dark time known as the depression. I've heard people were offended by the KKK scene, when all the Coen Brothers did was poke fun at the clan the whole time. If you get offended at that, I pray you don't turn on the tv or walk out you're front door, cause reality is much more offensive than a humorous PG-13 movie. George Clooney shows a whole different side of his ability as an actor, and I have new respect for him as a comedic actor, because I know not just anyone could pull off what he has as the dapper man he portrays. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you REALLY should. Bravo to the Coens' for having the guts, brains and imagination, to make a movie based around the great Odyssey. Oh, and this is a review of the dvd..... Dolby Digital's good, but DTS is better, and this dvd has it, that's a plus.

But what they have created is believable characters that you truely feel for even knowing they are criminals and that by the end of the film they are the ones you are rooting for, how rare is that in modern Hollywood. The Coens still seem determined to make movies that push the boundries of what is classed as mainstream Hollywood.

The easiest part of this movie to understand is the idea that the main characters could record a hit record.  Life is imitating art on a large scale when the soundtrack itself is a best seller.

1324235,5,B00003CXRM,"Alright, folks... here's your riddle of the day:  Whaddaya get if you cross the Three Stooges with the Greek poet Homer?

""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" that's what!

Here is another superb comedy finely crafted by screenwriters /producers/ directors Joel and Ethan Coen.  Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro,  it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none.

""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way.  Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash.  Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson).  The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named  Pete.  Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake.  Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.

As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they  will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.

Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful.  They continually run into strange people and situations...  a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments... three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime...  the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman who offers our heroes a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South...  and other characters as well including a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.

One of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou's?"" greatest strengths is its musical score.  As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background.  The songs - 19 of them by my count - are  all wonderful.  It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals.  From James Carter and the Prisoners' ""Po' Lazarus,"" through Alison Krause's sweetly  simple and reverent ""Down to the River to Pray"" (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee);  the old-time country classics ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Hard Rock Candy Mountain,"" and ""You Are My Sunshine;"" to the old-time Gospel classics ""Keep On the Sunny Side;"" ""I'll Fly Away"" and ""I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),"" (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film.  (By the way, all these songs can be found on the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)

I've now watched ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" about  a dozen times.  Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music.  In short... wonderfully entertaining in every respect.  A definite ""must-see"" for movie-lovers everywhere!",1016236800,14,3784,5.041867954911433

It has some great scenes and superb acting, but the whole thing never quite adds up to a satisfactory whole. Still, even a minor Cohen movie ranks above the Hollywood average.
The movie is based loosely - very loosely! - on Homer's epic Greek poem, The Odyssey. It takes place in the Mississippi Delta during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When it opens, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar [George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson] are escaping from a chain gang, and they spend most of the rest of the movie running from the law. Ulysses talks the other into escaping by claiming he buried the loot from a big robbery. They have to get to it quickly, he says, because the place where he buried it is about to be flooded for the creation of a lake. Their madcap adventures cause them to meet many strange, eccentric characters. There is the blind man who endlessly rides the rails and foretells the futures of those he meets. They meet the Bible salesman from hell, enthusiastically played by John Goodman, as well as three sirens who set out to seduce and rob them, a black blues musician who has just sold his soul the Devil at the crossroads, and Ulysses' wacky wife and daughters. They find some interesting discoveries, as well as some ugly surprises.
As is typical of a Cohen brothers film, this one is fast-paced and rarely gives the audience time to think about what it has just seen. The movie is more a series of vignettes than it is a well structured story. Scenes that work are both hilarious and impressive, but the problem is that others fall flat. Also, the ending is uninspired, as if the team were unable to come up with a suitable punch line to their tale.
Most of the actors here have worked with the Cohens before, which allows them to be quite comfortable in their roles. Tim Blake Nelson, as dimwitted Delmar, and Holly Hunter, as Ulysses' wife, are standout. This is George Clooney's first picture with this group, but he has no trouble fitting in. He is very good and very funny. In fact, in the last five years he has become one of my favorite actors.",1016150400,,2346,4.601431980906921
1324295,5,B00003CXRM,"I am a really big fan of the Cohen brothers. They are one of the most original and wickedly funny filmmaking teams to come along in some time. I've seen just about all of their movies, but of all their great films, I think this has to be my absolute favorite. I didn't go see this in the theater, because I had read some negative reviews of it, but when this came on video, my cousin who works in a video store told that it was hilarious.
So one night while his wife was working third-shift, he brought it home and I came over, we ordered a pizza, cracked a few brews, and watched this movie. Let me say that I don't know if I've EVER laughed so hard in my life. It's just a fun thing to watch and listen to.  So many great one-liners and oddball humor, the dialect, the ridiculous situations, the way Clooney sends up his own dapper image, as well as his hopeless attempts to lead the trio.  I just can't get enough of this, fa'real.  They play a group of escaped convicts who are determined to find some buried treasure that Ulysseus CLAIMS he knows where is.  The film is loosely based on Homer's 'The Odyssey', but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy the movie unless you're familiar with the book. I haven't read it since like the 9th grade, so I'm a little dusty on picking up all the references myself, but I still thought this movie was hilarious. I'm gonna have to go back and re-read it someday. The scene right after their encounter with the singing muses at the lake, when Ulysseus and Delmar think Pete has been turned into a toad is absolutely gut-busting.  Then when they come across him in the movie theater... damn, I can't even finish explaining the scene because I'm laughing so much right now just thinking about it.
The acting is absolutely superb, particularly John Turturro as Pete who proves once again that he is one of the most underrated and multi-faceted actors working today. The story is comical and always interesting, and the cinematography looks fantastic perfectly re-creating the bleak, dusty, bone-dry Depression Era South of the 1930s. The Cohen brothers are absolute cinematic geniuses and have proven it time and time again over the years. It's just all in good fun. They don't take their art too seriously, and therefore they make TRULY GREAT art.
'O Brother Where Art Thou?' is a modern classic, and if you don't get into upon your first viewing, then watch it again and I guarantee you it will grow on you. After my first viewing at my cousin' house I immediately went out and bought this movie, and since then I've watched it probably a good thirteen or fourteen times at least. I mean, I just can't get enough of it. The only recent movie that can even compare to it in terms of originality and entertainment is probably 'Snatch' which incidently I also have watched a ridiculous amount of times. And, on a final note, the bluegrass tunes in this movie are wildly addicitive, even if you don't like that kind of music. I find myself humming 'A Man of Constant Sorrow' to myself all the time.",1016064000,,3033,4.497277676950998
1324296,5,B00003CXRM,"This is a very good movie.  It was funny and entertaining.  This film was not very realistic, but I enjoyed it any ways.  It was not meant to be taken very seriously, but paints a very real picture of life in the south during the 1930's.  The music is good too--blue eyed blues.
The DVD was a good purchase as well.  It includes the video of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", as well as other footage.
This is clearly a good movie about three men who escape the chain gang in order to seek treasure.  The mastermind, Ulysses (George Clooney), appearently lied about this treasure in order to reach his ex-wife before she remarries.  His lie was necessary since the two others were clained with him.  On the way they get into all sorts of situations, including rescuing their friend from a mob and assissting in a bank robbery.  All this in order to remarry an overbearing woman, who seemed disinterested in the father of her own children.  Only after they realize their own popularity as an old-time country act does their fortune change.
The movie is 103 minutes, and 24 chapters.  It was orginally released in 1996.  I suggest you go into it with no preconceptions or expectations, and lose yourself in it.",1015977600,2,1200,4.582159624413146
1324297,5,B00003CXRM,"The Coen Brother's O Brother, Where Art Thou? is based on Homer's Odyssey and the film is a magical journey through 1930's Mississippi.  The film centers on three escaped convicts who are trying to get to $... that Everett has stashed away at his home before it gets flooded out for a new hydropower network that's being set up.  The three cons are hilariously played by George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Tuturro.  Mr. Clooney in particular shines as Everett.  He fashions himself as an intellectual and his crazed obsession with his hair is hysterical.  Everywhere he goes he must have Dapper Dan pomade and hairnets.  Along the way on their journey, they met a man who sold his soul to the devil in order to play a mean guitar,  cut a record as The Soggy Bottom Boys that, unbeknownst to them becomes a big hit, met three sirens who seduce them, met a crooked bible salesman (played with hilarious gusto by John Goodman) and cross paths with the governor (Charles Durning).  In the end Everett is really looking to stop his wife (Holly Hunter) from remarrying.  The film strings together all of its twists and turns brilliantly.  The acting is first rate, the cinematography adds a brownish hue reminiscent of photographs from the era and of course, the soundtrack has recently won a Grammy as Album of the Year.  All in all, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a first rate film.",1015977600,3,1384,4.631147540983607
1324298,4,B00003CXRM,"I was not sure what to expect when I sat down to watch O Brother, in fact I expected to get bored with it and shut it off.  This is a not a run of the mill film, and I think what happened is they let a run of the mill marketing group handle the publicity for it.  It is really not a fugitive story, which is what everything from the cover to the commercials had me thinking.  This movie has good humor, a likeable story and great old-timey and gospel music (and I don't listen to either of those and still thought they were great).  The Siren Scene was my favorite.
There is only one fault I can find with this movie: The last scene in the old cabin in the valley was completely unnecessary for the story and I would have enjoyed this movie more without it.  We did not need to bring that plot line to a close, it was satisfying enough before.  I felt that the scene was a gratuitous excuse to throw in another song or draw the movie out another 5 minutes to meet some kind of quota.

And if you took the risk on this movie, well all i have to say is sorry because it doesn't have any dialogue nor nutin.  But what makes you hate the movie the most is just that it isn't funny at all.

If you add this to your collection it will be one of the few that you pull off of the shelf time and time again to watch.
I don't want to give away anything to those few who have not seen the movie but Clooney and Turturo both put on outstanding performances. You will fall in love with the ""Old Timey Harmony"" songs that litter the movie, and after the twentieth time you've watched you'll be able to sing right along...This movie is a 'Must Buy'.",1015459200,4,666,4.4227642276422765
1324301,2,B00003CXRM,"It is unfortunate that a film that received such widespread acclaim and boasts being based on Homer's Odyssey could let its viewer down with such a hollow piece of work. The synthesis of Depression-era Mississippi and Homeric Greece falls flat on its face; instead of intelligently incorporating the Odyssey's themes, the film blatantly steals scenes to no apparent effect. The siren scene, for example, is of no consequence to the film; our hereos get sucked in by their song and then....nothing. The scene with John Goodman, who turns in yet another memorable albeit brief role as the ""cyclops,"" also has no significance to the ""plot."" Rather it seems that the Coen brothers stole the form of the Odyssey but left the content behind, apparently for no other reason than to get people to see this vacuous movie.
Speaking of getting people into the seats....George Clooney was hopelessly unconvincing as a smooth talking backwoodsman with pommaded hair. The film is full of largely unknown actors, most of whom do impressive jobs, and their anonymity adds to the believability of the movie. Yet Clooney stands out like a sore thumb in the dusty, gritty setting. His character is not even that likeable. For example, his whole reason for escaping was to reunite with his wife, with whom he has about as much spark as a jar of mayonnaise.
A few redeeming qualities: the music is quite good, and Clooney's sidekicks give very good performances. But throughout the film, I was waiting for it to inspire me, to move me--hell, just make me laugh. It did none of this. Like the average American tourist in Europe, the Coen brothers did nothing more than walk through the motions of the Odyssey, stopping every now and then to take photographs of their ignorant, smug faces in front of a majesterial backdrop they fail to comprehend.",1015372800,4,1825,4.890322580645162

This is perfect Coen Bros. Clooney, Turturro, Hunter, and the rest of the ensemble cast don't disappoint. The music is great and really becomes an integral part of the story. Wonderful viewing when you need a good laugh. Tonight I am snowed in here in Chicago and this is what I needed to cheer up in what looks like a blizzard.

This movie does showcase yet another facet of George Clooney's acting talents and if you're a George Clooney fan, you'll probably enjoy this one more because of it. The best part of the movie, however, was by far the singing! Soundtrack is full of wonderful, rich, sing-able songs. Rent the movie, buy the soundtrack.",1014940800,,621,4.980769230769231

So after a short time passed, I thought I would give it another try.  I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time through.  Some of the music is a bit slow for my tastes, but a lot of it is just great, down-home bluegrass.  The movie can drag on a bit as well.  (That's why I gave it only 4 stars).
The characters in this movie really are characters in a different sense.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson do a wonderful job in this movie, and seem to portray people of this era well.

1324422,5,B00003CXRM,"Only the Coen Brothers could loosely base a film on THE ODYSSEY, set it in rural 1930s Mississippi, change the lead character from a war hero to an escaped chain-gang convict, and make the movie work successfully. The plot of the movie is that Ulysses ""Everett"" McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts, chained together, who have escaped and are on the run to supposedly fine some loot (1.2 million dollars to be exact) that ""Everett"" buried before he was put in the pen. Along the way they meet a variety of characters from a blind railroad man, a one-eyed Bible salesman, three beautiful sirens washing clothes in the river, and George ""Babyface"" Nelson. Throw in a Klu Klux Klan meeting that starts off in a rousing musical number that seems a cross between a Broadway musical and the flying monkey theme from THE WIZARD OF OZ; a couple of lynch mobs; back-stabbing family members; a prayed for miracle flood of Biblical proportions; and a strange character who seems a lot like the devil and you're in for a toe-stomping, roller coaster ride of a movie filled with humor of all kinds.

Many people have criticized the movie because they don't understand what's going on throughout the movie. To begin with, the film is loosely based on Homer's THE ODYSSEY. If you're familiar with that classic piece of literature, you will have a better understanding of the movie and perhaps appreciate it a bit more. But if you aren't familiar with THE ODYSSEY, it really shouldn't make too much of a difference. This is a Coen brother's film and like all of their movies it is quirky, somewhat bizarre, and full of classical and pop cultural references. The humor is on several different levels from visual gags to witty word play.

However, not everyone will find the film enjoyable. Nevertheless, this is probably the most audience accessible of all Coen films. It's made in the same sort of style as RAISING ARIZONA and THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and has a ""happy"" ending. The film feels like one is watching an old silent film brought to life and connected together. Not only that, but the movie also has one of the best soundtracks in recent years; the music is a key part of the film.

Other than that all I can say is that my brother and I are different as night and day and there aren't very many movies we both enjoy. We both loved this movie.",1012780800,,2340,4.6201923076923075

1324425,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie was quite a joyride, and one must really 'doff one's hat' to
  the Coen brothers, the producer-director duo who make 'different' movies.
  The movie is a take-off of sorts on 'The three stooges' and 'Ullyses',
  but you may not notice that without looking at the 'production feauterette'
  - one of the many 'DVD extras' included.
  The story goes like this : Clooney plays a smooth-talking convict who
  tells the other two prisoners chained to him at the prison farm that
  he'd buried a treasure before getting busted, and they escape, setting
  out in search of the treasure.
  They run into a blind old man, who prophesises that they'll have a long
  journey, a the end of which they'll find a great treasure, though not
  the one they seek. He also predicts that they'll have a great many
  adventures along the way.
  And so begins a roller-coaster ride, which takes you along the tide of
  emotions, with many a laugh all along, and a generous dose of great
  folk music (the movie is set in the depression era of 1930s).
  The acting is great - Clooney's outstanding, and is ably supported by
  John Torturro & Tim Blake-Nelson, Holly Hunter & a plethora of actors
  with interesting cameos who keep coming all the time.
  The direction's even better, as the narrative flows smoothly - you
  don't realize where the time goes, and there lots of 'little touches'
  here & there which underscore the expert direction.
  But the real highlight is the great music, which is really infectious
  - in particular 'Man of constant sorrow', which is the showpiece song.
  I can't help humming it all the time, ever since i heard it !!
  Coming to the DVD, it's been put together very well - the 'production
  featurette' gives you an insight into how the Coen brothers work and
  little tidbits about the movie & the actors, and there are 'sneak peeks'
  and a video of 'A man of constant sorrow', apart from the trailor.
  But the part that i liked best was 'Painting with pixels', in which you
  get to know how Computers were used to give the scenes a unique feel.
  They show you he scenes as taken originally by the camera, and then
  after 'treatment' on the Computers. The 'before-after' difference is
  amazing ........
  All in all, a movie & DVD i heartily recommend - two thumbs up :-) !!",1012176000,4,2310,4.579601990049751
1324426,5,B00003CXRM,"If you're as big a Coen fan as I am, then you will definitely not want to miss this movie. Joel and Ethan have really outdone themselves this time. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, O Brother, Where Art Thou? retains most of the Coens' signature quirkiness, while introducing a few fresh faces to their ragtag bunch (George Clooney and Tim Blake Nelson). But fear not, lifelong fans - the film also contains our much-loved actors John Goodman, John Turturro, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning (who we last saw confined to a wheelchair in The Big Lebowski).
Set in 1930s rural Mississippi, the movie opens with Clooney, Nelson and Turturro escaping from a chain gang to seek their fortune. The action (and laughs) begin right away, with the boys trying to hop a freight train while still chained together - and it only gets funnier from there. From sirens to sheriffs, the boys go through heaven and hell...but they sure have a great time doing it.
As I said before, anyone who is a Coen fan needs to see this movie. However, those whose movie tastes run toward big-budget blockbusters in the tradition of Titanic will probably not enjoy O Brother, Where Art Thou? as much. Still, no matter who you are, the movie is a pretty entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. Do yourself a favor and go rent this movie. Odds are, you'll be back here buying it before too long.",1012176000,,1369,4.614754098360656
1324427,4,B00003CXRM,"Each recent Coen Brothers film mirrors the one before it.  ""Fargo"" was a dark comic tale with one million dollars at its center.  ""The Big Lebowski"" was a comic tale with one million dollars at its center (in both cases that center included Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", however, is different.  It begins with a search for one-point-TWO million dollars.
""The Odyssey"" meets ""The Three Stooges"" meets Delta-blues-and-bluegrass meets Robert Altman's ""Thieves Like Us"", the latest Coen offerent almost defies conventional description.  Like ""Big Lebowski"", it's best viewed as a collection of anecdotes, and it doesn't really ends, so much as cuts to the closing credits at a logical breaking-off point.
Three escaped convicts bumble around parched Mississip in 1937.  Their lead is played surprisingly well by George Clooney, who's covered in dirt, stubble, and Dapper Dan pomade from beginning to end.  John Turturro is rather muted, dropping out of the middle section entirely.  Tim Blake Nelson, playing the ""dumb"" one (similar to Steve Buscemi's role in ""Lebowski""), was previously unknown to me but stole nearly every scene he was in.  The movie's signature line belongs to him:  ""Oh, George, not the livestock!""
The supporting roles are all Coen Brothers returnees: John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, and of course they steal all their scenes as well.  You'll never want for great acting in a Coen Brothers movie and this is one of their stronger casts.
The DVD contains a couple of interesting features, and I say this without having watched the multi-angle storyboards.  The cinematography featurette is an eye-opener, pointing out details in the film's color scheme I would not have noticed on my own.

It was quirky and out of the ordinary, but still hugely entertaining, which is tough for these kind of movies, since it's so easy to ruin them. The combination of mood, music and humor make this a must see for anyone. I picture the 1930's South more like this than the great classic movies such as Grapes of Wrath (in which life was always miserable)and the screwball comedies (where life was great).  Life was tough, but people still lived there lives and still tried to enjoy what they could.  I've seen this movie 4-5 times and listen to the soundtrack often.  It also gave me a new appreciation for old time southern/bluegrass music that I never had before.  I think this is easily the best movie that the Cohen Bros have done, and hope they do more like it.  The music from the baptism and the Sirens was terrific.",1012003200,,921,4.42603550295858

The movie is charming, gutsy, and hugely entertaining.  George Clooney-- who happens to look remarkably like Clark Gable in this movie-- shows his talent for the comedic in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talker in the trio of escapees fleeing a chain gang in 1920s Mississippi.

Scared away when a movie is said to have ""a message""?  Don't worry, it's so subtle you may not even notice.  It's not like most movies today that beat the audience over the head with it.  ""O Brother"" is funny, engaging, exciting, and even a little romantic.  (And, if you enjoy well-told tales, that DO have messages, you'll really enjoy this.

It was probably my all-time favorite movie --that is, until I bought my own copy and saw how money-hungry, consensus-building editors had ruined this masterpiece. I am a big bluegrass and blues fan and really loved the varied music, and in the original, caught a glipse of the South of my grandparents' time in the picturesque scenery and hilarious spoofs on the bigotry that was an unfortunate reality of the day. The portions that were cut out of the theatre version were the very ""glue"" that held the story together from beginning to end and what made the corallary with ""The Odessey"" credible. Worst of all perhaps was the omission of critical scenes that not only destroyed the plot and developed the characters, but defamed the music as well, especially Allison Crouse's solo and subsequent choral crescendo leading up to the baptismal scene.

The cinematography is great and the faded and brown overtones, which the whole film is shot in, give it a really rustic and homey feel. THe movie was casted perfectly, and every character coems to vibrant life. It really feels like your travelling down south in the early 30's or 40's. The crowning achievement on the film is the soundtrack. Aside from the ""man of constant sorrow"" song, which is heard several times throughtout the film, the backround music as well as the songs sung by the supporting cast are all excellent. They really immerse the audience into the movie.  The disc itself is good as far as dvd's go. THe picture is very crisp, and looks beautiul on any tv. the sound wasn't mind blowing but was very good. Extras are there but they are kinda boring unless you're really interested in the computer generated elements of the film. The best extra is the music video which is fun but not stupendous.
 I'd say the majority of people will at least kinda enjoy the movie, even if they don't love it. In the same vein as the hudsucker proxy and Raising Arizona, O brother is a whimsical journey through the back country.

1324608,5,B00003CXRM,"I like this film. While predictable, the take on the Odyssey adds a depth that satidfies intellectually while increasing the comic element.
The characters are casted wonderfully. Clooney, with his winsome smile and fast talking, while not exactly Odysseus (a man of many turnings and ways) is terrific and entertaining. The supporting characters, though, is what makes this film delightful.

Only here, they're rescuing Tommy Johnson.
Anyway, it is no way lessened my enjoyment of this movie. I find these guys to be incredibly clever and rather sweet-natured with their products.

Twenty years from now, they'll be airing this film on AMC and TCM alongside the likes of North by Northwest, The Wild Bunch and How Green Was My Valley.
The story is completely engrossing and the cinematography is stunning.  Realize that filming took place in June/July when the Southern countryside was a lush, verdant green. That bone dry, depression-era dust bowl aesthetic is a wonder of digital editing.
The Coen brothers have done two things that are all too rare in Hollywood these days.  First, their screenplay is original (yes, it's loosely based on Homer's Odyssey but to evaluate the film solely on this narrative framework is to overlook the other aspects of the film). Second, they've produced a film that captivates not with multi-million dollar action sequences and the latest Moby track but with great dialogue and an authentic blues/bluegrass soundtrack (well worth buying) that is as much a character in the movie as the three principals - Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro).  The eclectic cast (that also includes Charles Durning, Holly Hunter, Stephen Root and John Goodman) turns in superbly acted performances across the board.  Clooney, who all too often plays 2 dimensional characters, gives an award-worthy performance in what is unquestionably his best role to date.  Those not familiar with Nelson or Turturro will be impressed by these wonderfully skilled actors.
I will say that a lot of people have told me that they didn't care for this film, which I find incomprehensible.  I'm not sure what more you could ask for in a movie.",1009497600,218,1769,4.95945945945946

I was not a huge fan of this movie at first; it just didn't seem as funny to me as it was intended to be.  However, after watching ""Sullivan's Travels"" recently and re-watching ""O Brother"" (to save space, I'll leave out their connection; it can be found in other reviews on Amazon), it was MUCH funnier for me-""Sullivan"" definitely put me in the right mind-set for this.  After a few viewings, you can also pick up all the great dialog you may have missed, and you notice all the elements that are in here-Homer, ""old-timey"" music, American folklore (the crossroads, the klan, etc), road pictures, Preston Sturges' influence, and alot of the trademark Coen brothers stuff.  It seems to me that being familiar with any of these is definitely helpful in enjoying this film.  That's what gives it 5 stars for me; I'd have given it 4 stars before seeing ""Sullivan's Travels"" and really taking the time to soak everything up that's in ""O Brother.....""",1009324800,,1077,4.474489795918367

The story is silly and fun and keeps a smile on your face. The music is a much needed cinematic nod to a unique American sound that has been lost to so many of us. The tunes fit the story perfectly and lift the movie to a level of pure enjoyment. Or was the story wrapped around the tunes? Hard to tell and doesn't really matter.
There are lots of moments in this film that will leave you chuckling long after you see it: The Siren scene; Clooney's rapid exit from a boxcar; the upside down bloodhound drifting by in the flood; the blind radio station owner (talk about great character actors); Delmar's joyous river baptism; and on and on and on.
It's worth noting that the Coens pay tribute here to the wonderful 1941 film ""Sullivan's Travels"" from which they unabashedly took their title. The ideas for a few scenes seem tie back to ""Sullivan"" as well, including the boxcar chase.
Finally, Tim Blake Nelson is incredible as the sweet half-wit Delmar. Clooney and Turturro seem like easy choices for the Brothers Coen, and both do great work here.

The DVD is very well assembled, with some good behind-the-scenes stuff, including a facinating documentary called ""Painting with Pixels"" which details the exclusive use of computer color processing for the entire film(quite a challange).  The 5.1 Dolby soundtrack creates a masterful sound field which adds so much to the experience.  There is also a DTS for anyone who can decode it.

1324775,3,B00003CXRM,"This is a movie that seems better looking back on it than it does while being watched.  Many scenes are stand-alone works of art, visually and aurally enchanting, and looking back on these scenes will make you think the movie must have been better than it seemed at the time.  The acting is superb (not just Clooney, who is great, but the supporting cast shines with only a couple of exceptions), the music is just wonderful (traditional American music, sweet and haunting), and the cinematography is outstanding.
  The problem, unfortunately, is that the threads that try to tie this movie together are weak.  My recollection of Homer's Odyssey novel (which this movie is based on) is not that strong, but I don't remember it being a buddy picture where the characters move from one escapade to another with little common goals or plot.  Supposedly the plot is to retrieve some buried money and for Clooney's character to get back with his wife, but so many scenes do nothing to advance those issues at all and are done with such care and spectacle they end up as just confusing.  At the end of ""OBWAT"" I had to ask myself ""what was the point of that?"" and I have to answer that the point was to put a bunch of very pretty scenes together.
  My other beef with this picture is in how it was advertised.  The studio tries to sell it as a comedy, and while there are some funny scenes and I did laugh out loud a couple of times, this is really an art movie.

The structure of the film isn't as cogent as their previous films however it is very well crafted in terms of cinamatography and especially the music.

1324777,4,B00003CXRM,"This is a rare opportunity, to review a film so entirely enjoyable,  so entertaining beyond my wildest imaginations, funnier than I could have possible expected, yet still without living up to the potential that it undoubtedly possessed.  I've heard--whether or not it is true, I don't know--that the Coen brothers prided themselves on the fact that ""this is their interpretation of the Odyssey without ever having actually read it.""  I'm inclined to believe that if they actually HAD read it, they could have constructed a far more diverse spoof that covered some of the more absurd and interesting adventures of Homer's tale.  But, regardless, whether they did or not I cannot say anything but that this film is one of the most entertaining I've ever had the pleasure to witness.
And thus, this film becomes somewhat of a paradox, because there is a lot for me to criticize.  Admittedly, Homer doesn't follow an ongoing plot too closely; he seemed content to get his hero home and with his wife.  The Coen brothers, however, take this neglegable attention to plot to an even greater extent however, as it follows more traditional road trip, buddy comedies by interspersed adventures that have relatively no bearing on future events or occurances.  I have to imagine that they could have weaved a much more integrated tale, combining their elements more comprehensively into a geniune story--or at least something resembling it.  For this reason, by the film's conclusion I find myself somewhat unsatisfied, as I know the potential was always there, but never executed to the degree that such a promising idea should have been.
But still, beyond that, I was entertained.  As is expected from the Coen brothers, they somehow dredge of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen: always just craziest enough to represent some guy that you know.  The acting is superb, especially leads George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro.  Meanwhile, as the stories ""plot"" takes our protagonists from hilarious situation to hilarious situation, the film just keeps getting funnier and funnier, entertaining in new and obscure ways that one might have never thought imaginable.
So, to summarize this film, it is perhaps the funniest and most entertaining movie that ever succeeded despite its blatently apparent lack of overall cohesion.  If you can overlook something negligable like cosistancy--as I most certainly did--then you will no doubt learn to love this film for all of its humorous situations, idiosyncratic characters, and--yes--even its faults: indeed they are big, but of little consequence when you find yourself so wholly enjoying the film before you.  I'll admittedly leave off with the comment that this isn't the Coen brothers' best, but even after adding it to their repotoire, cannot be deemed in any way ""bad.""  They are two of the greatest filmmakers in Hollywood, and if this movie can prove that even one of their lesser pictures still exceeds almost everything else offered, then it stands as a testament to their ability and genius.",1007683200,4,3062,5.110220440881764

1324779,4,B00003CXRM,"While not normally one with extremely eclectic taste in movies, I must admit this film hit a spot with me. A retelling of Homer's Odyssey through the eyes of an escaped convict during the Great Depression. How wonderful.
The basic story, for those who have never read Homer's classic work, deals with a man name Ulysses (Odyseus was his Greek name), who is forced to wander rather than return straight home. Along the way, he meets a Cyclops (John Goodman is perfect in this role) and sirens (wonderful scene). At home, his wife has been set up to wed someone whose ethics are less than sterling. And, it is all here, only a lot more humorous.
In many circles, the soundtrack (wonderful bluegrass) has gained more attention than the movie. While the album is excellent, the movie also has its sterling moments.
Now, this may just be a guy thing, as my wife, who had never read Homer's Odyssey (not sure how that happened) thought the movie was just plain wierd.
I would love to give this film 5 stars, and probably should, but I am sure part of my adoration comes from the fact that Hollywood has churned out so much garbage lately that this film shines that much brighter in my book.",1007510400,,1184,4.537383177570093

In one scene the 3 fugitives see these ladies who start singing and seducing them.  In my teenage perspective, I don't want to see some old dudes being seduced by beautiful women. (George Clooney is hot though)  I was laughing a lot of the time, but I did not understand this at all.  Every couple of minutes I was like, where did this dude come from? My mom and I were in tears we were laughing so hard after the movie was over, cuz we didn't get it AT ALL.

1324847,3,B00003CXRM,"First - the movie.  Three convicts escape from a chain-gang and set of on a quest, supposedly based on the Odyssey, although the Coens later claimed to have never read it.  However, we have Sirens who abduct one of the escapees, a Cyclops (played by John Goodman), and a Penny (Penelope).  In addition, we have less obvious characters, such as a manic-depressive bank robber, a KKK-belonging gubernatorial candidate, and his populist encumbant opponent.  All of these characters provide some big laughs, little chuckles, and a healthy dose of bluegrass music.  It's all presented in a washed-out colour that lends a beautiful visual style to the piece.
The film has most of the hallmarks of the Coen brothers.  This depression-era Mississippi didn't ever exist, but we wish it did.  It's filled with caricature characters with amusing quirks and one-track minds.  Missing is the occasional brutal violence that has a tendency to crop up in some of their work.  As such, this is one of the most good-hearted of the Coens' films, and I enjoyed it more than, say, Fargo.  However, it's probably more forgettable than their other work.  In addition, the film is almost a musical with its profusion of tunes.  However, I'm not much of a bluegrass fan, so found that the musical parts, though well-done, could have been shortened.  It moved just a little too slowly and lingered just a little too long in these passages.
Secondly - the DVD version.  Obviously, the sound and picture is very good, but the DVD left me disappointed.  Who could be more interesting in a commentary track than the Coen brothers?  Alas, there is no commentary - the best we get is a making of featurette that is only 20 minutes or so.  It's okay in itself, but too short to compensate.  Of equal length is a piece on the digitisation of the film to achieve the desired look (which could have been told in 1/2 the time) and a storyboard-to-film comparison, which was not particularly interesting.
The film might rate a 4, but this DVD edition is disappointing, and drops the rating to a 3.  I would certainly recommend it as a renter, but not worth the cost of buying the DVD.",1007251200,,2147,4.738544474393531

The characters were done so well, I think all three leads deserve Best Actor. The music and scenery were haunting and beautiful, but believable. And who ever suspected that George Clooney and Chuck Berry were separated at birth?

The music is TERRIFIC!!  The scenery is beautiful.  The story has great potential.  Clooney is not, perhaps, cut out for a film career, though he sure does look great.

The soundtrack is really good, it sets the mood well and if you like the sound of old folkish music it is just plain good.

1324852,5,B00003CXRM,"O Brother Where Art Thou is by far one of the funniest movies I seen in years.  The humor is subtle in parts.  The humor is not your typical hollywood guy running down the street with butt showing..instead this is the thinking person humorous movie.  I have met people who simply didn't get this movie because they fail to see the humor of the dialoge.
Hollywood has programmed this generation that if the joke doesn't revolve around sex or nudity it can't be funny.  One of the best parts of this movie is the ability to see the level of humor in polar opposite such as Everett and Delmar.  The two are complete mental opposies.  Everett is the ""brains"" and Delmar is the ""lack there of"".  I think the balance of this movie is found in these two characters.
However, the two  characters are joined by a third person who fills in the gaps of Everett and Delmar.  His name was Pete.  Now Pete seems a cut above Delmar mentally but, he falls short of Everett.  So what we find is a nice mix of Intellivence,Ignorance, and dumb innocense.  The 3 amigos face challenge after challenge to reach ""the treasure"".  Along the way, they find abilities they didn't know they had, make friends with bible salesman, and pick up hitch-hickers.  All the while the trio find themselves in the middle of some of the best comedic situations on earth.  In short, If you like a movie that is funnier the 2nd time you watch it.  Get O Brother!

I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie while waiting to meet someone at a mall, but I was entranced.  I found it touching, funny, and thought-provoking all at the same time.
The only drawback was that sometimes the dialogue was unintelligible - kind of the aural equivalent of all of those scenes where it's so dark that you can't see what is happening. Now I realize that making the movie-goer uncomfortable and sit forward in his seat may have a role in a suspense movie, but there is no role for this kind of manipulation in a movie that is supposed to be entertaining.
Nevertheless, I bought this movie the first day it was out - I even pre-ordered it.  I usually don't buy movies, nor do I watch them more then once.  I've enjoyed it immensely and the music is incredible.",1006300800,,972,4.324175824175824

I finally got around to watching it a second time all the way through.  Since then, I have become a Coen affecionado, discovering more and more the subtle yet hilarious comedy that the Coen brothers seem to flavor all their movies with.  I HAD to go out and buy this film, and I've watched the movie about a dozen times now, finding it more funny every time.  One of my most-watched DVD's in my collection.

Just look at any current movie preview, and chances are you'll see a list of artists contributing to the soundtrack, usually popular bands and / or rap groups.  As appealing as these soundtracks sometimes are, especially to the ""teenage demographic,"" few of these top-sellers actually contribute anything to the storyline and plot movement.  In fact, hearing P Diddy or Smashmouth blare out some tune at a key moment in the movie is often more distracting than it is helpful.
That is what makes ""O Brother"" so special.  The soundtrack is simply phenomenal, and it blends so effortlessly with the rest of the film.  Some people refer to the movie as a musical, which it isn't; but I wouldn't mind seeing a musical with more of the same kind of music.  It is important to note that none of the music I'm referring to is ""background"" music-- instead, it is all sung by characters in one manner or another.  And the music alone would make the movie worth seeing, let alone the fabulous acting, which others have touched on nicely.

1324951,5,B00003CXRM,"Homer's Oddysey set during the Great Depression, with a trio of chain gang fugitives as the protagonists. Who woulda thunk? I don't know either, but give him credit for a fabulously enjoyable movie.
George Clooney is magnificent as Ulysses (that's really his name), an extremely witty and articulate convict who is obsessed with two things. The first is finding a hidden treasure from one of his earlier ""jobs,"" and second is his hair. The contrast between his brilliant and often incisive repartee, and the dull witted utterances of his oafish companions, is truly a sight to behold (can I say that about the spoken word?).
The ""Odyssey"" theme is well developed, complete with Sirens and the Cyclops (played by none other than John Goodman, of course), and the movie loosely follows its plot line. There are some interesting allusions to the supernatural, and some blatant allegorizing of several characters, such as the ubiquitous ""boss"" sheriff with the fires of hell reflecting from his sunglasses. Several scenes are downright surreal, while others will have you holding your gut with laughter. Oh, and by the way, the good guys manage to ""get religion"" and turn the popular music world on its head as they go on about their merry way.
Literary references aside, though, you'll enjoy this movie immensely even if you've never read Homer. The language is generally unobjectionable, there's no nudity, and minimal non-gory violence, in other words, a family friendly affair. Watch this flick. You'll be glad you did.",1005264000,,1519,5.08

But I wanted to see it because I am such a music fan, and come on, this is some great musical work!  However, I will proudly admit that I couldn't have been more wrong about George. I now know that Clooney is one of the best actors of our time and he truly gave an excellent performance. His comedic performance in this movie was unparalleled! This is now one of my favorite movies and I hope that Clooney is given many more roles that let him expand his talent, so that he isn't typecast as the handsome rogue in everything.  There is much more to him than that.  As always, John Turturro gave an outstanding performance, as did Holly Hunter and John Goodman...LOVE HIM! And I fell in love with Tim Blake Nelson's Delmar. This movie should be on everyone's list of favorites and you HAVE to buy the soundtrack.  And back to Clooney....wow!

I would agree with the last reviewer who loved the strange humor and excellent acting.  I loved the story and the music that carried it along.  Not true that the Coen Brothers never read the Odyssey...that was a bit of a joke...they said in another interview that that is their favorite book, and they read it quite often.
Loved the characters, but everyone seems to have the impression that it starred Clooney, Turturro, and Goodman, in that order.  They forget Tim Blake Nelson, who had most of lines -- if you don't count Everett's loquacious yammering.  In fact, Blake's character Delmar (""dumber than a bag of hammers"") had the best, funniest, and most provocative lines in the movie.  He also had the right accent, something most of the supposedly Mississipian characters did not.  George Cloony's was on and off, mostly off, although the actor is originally from Kentucky. (Blake is from Oklahoma and sounded dead-on just like my southern relatives.)
The jacket hints that Pete (Turturro) is bad-tempered, but nothing would seem to indicate that he was.  He wasn't as adorable and innocent as Delmar, but he wasn't much brighter.

George Clooney is good as the calm, conniving leader of the escapees, and his dirty sidekicks are hilarious. John Goodman has a notable appearance as a smooth-talking cyclops, and the man who plays the governor (whose name alas eludes me) is absoloutely superb in his role as corrupt politician. The film is visually beautiful, shot entirely through some kind of yellow filter that gives it a bleached appearance that feels very appropriate both to the American south of the period in which it is set, and to the ancient Greek world of Homer's Odyssey on which the story is based. The old-timey music that the convicts perform (at one point they become a singing trio called ""The Soggy Bottom Boys!"") is appealing as well. You will enjoy watching this odd and unpredicatble effort, but I must say that it is not perfect. I have a problem with the way the Odyssey parallels are handled. Simply put, they don't make much sense in the modern setting unless you know that they are meant to be from the Odyssey. There is no subtlety in the parallels, so that basically what we are given is the Odyssey set in 1930s Missippi, for no apparent reason. I wish they could have done a better job of making events ring true in the modern setting - so that if you watched the movie and didn't know the Odyssey, it would all still make some kind of sense, however odd. But this is not the case, and I feel disappointed, in that they could have made it into a truly great movie this way instead of merely an interesting and good one.

Following their tales of the upper Midwest (Fargo) and a bowler from LA (The Big Lebowski) comes a take on Homer's Odyssey in the dirty 30s. George Clooney stars as our traveling hero Ulysses Everett McGill a man obsessed with his image and his special hair treatment.
McGill convinces his jail buddies Pete (John Turturro) and Delmer (Tim Black Nelson) to escape alongside him with promise of a million dollar treasure awaiting them at the end of the trip. The trip really is all about him trying to re-unite with his wife in time before she gets remarried. Right away they run into a prophetic blind man on a railroad cart who warns them of their fate and then the standard Coen craziness begins.
Among the things our trio of runaways encounters are one-eyed bulky bible salesman, 3 sirens who seduce them, the Klan, and a manic depressive bank robber amongst other things. Joining them off and on through their journey is Tommy, a black man who tells them he sold his soul to the devil so he could play the guitar, which does come in handy when the pop into a recording studio and make some easy money singing what becomes a smash hit for the movie world and in reality with ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".
I will admit to having to see this film 3 or 4 times before it really clicked with me, but Coen fans in the end will absolutely adore this picture. The film is highlighted by solid acting performances and some great cinematography and the roots soundtrack, which brought as much attention to the picture as anything.

Without getting into too much amateur-film-critic-pretentious-verbosity, this movie was surely a magical trip for the senses, and somehow married depression-era settings and mythological themes seamlessly.

All in all, no matter what level you love movies on, you should be able to enjoy this.  The story, performances, direction, and especially the soundtrack, are absolutely outstanding and I found myself smiling with goosebumps many times throughout this film!",1003190400,,743,5.443478260869565

Clooney, Blake and Turturo were a stroke of casting genius (many mention Clooney as the shining star in the film, but Turturo's turn was just as genius... in fact, so was Blake's).  And the supporting cast - hilarious!  And the soundtrack... sublime.
The Coens are cinematographic geniuses at work as well.  The shots, the dialogue, the flow - near perfection, it is.
What can I say?  This is one of the most unique films I've watched.  Superb!",1002844800,2,670,4.4958677685950414
1325111,5,B00003CXRM,"Joel and Ethan Cohen have taken us into the inner depths of Americana. From the Cold recesses in the Midwest in ""Fargo,"" the bland suburbs of LA in ""The Big Lebowski"" and the solitude of the deserts in ""Raising Arizona"". Now The Coens have taken us into the heart of the Deep South in the 1930's in an imaginative and surrealistic telling of one of the original novels in the history of writing.
Obviously it took the Coens a while to properly concieve Homer's ""Odyssey"" not only in a different setting but as a comedy which boasts a surprisingly piquant wit. Well they've managed to do it in an almost seamless manner. As you can see the Coens wasted no time in setting the scene. Opening with sweeping crane, and still shots of a chain gang singing their haunting melody. Then soon we jump to a montage of our heroes Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogswallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, making a discreet yet clumsy escape from ""The Farm"" while incorporated with richly authentic, old-timey music. It shows us that these three men obviously have a long difficult path to follow. Then post-credits we are immediately supplied with a hilarious physical gag right out of the gate. Then soon we finally get the taste of the trio's personalities. spontaneously you see that Everett is a proud man who attempts to be intellectually inclined. Then you have Pete, who's highly rough-around-the-edges. The there's the clueless but good-hearted Delmar. Immediately they set up the characters likeability within the first five minutes with the sparkling dialogue. Which has become a staple in the Coen Brothers' illustrious careers.
Aside from the films delightful surprises you get to see some of our favorite actors, new and old, playing charaters that go beyond unique. Probably the one most worth mentioning is George Clooney as Everett. The casting job couldn't have been more perfect(Clooney now has a Golden Globe to prove it). As you watch him boast and brag you see the constant look that states that he's so sure that he is right all the time.  When in reality the opposite is the truth. Next there's John Tuturro as Pete. His stance and his gruff tone display his harsh, rough upbrining. Which explains his tendency to lash out. finally there's Tim Blake Nelson (Director of ""O"") and his performance as Delmar. Nelson's performance is dead-on target. even when he's handing George ""babyface"" Nelson his Tommy Gun, he still asks what George's profession is after George opens fire on the police giving chase then on helpless livestock. And you can see the childlike innocence on his face when he whimpers ""Oh, George, Not the Livestock.""
And even the otherwordly characters from the basis novel. make unique and symbolic appearances from the blind wandering prophet, the Cyclops (played to perfection by Coens Alumi John Goodman.), plus the standout scene of the three sirens singing seducing and sedating our three heroes. ""Those Sirens loved him up and turned him into a... Horny Toad!""
You gotta love the utter creativity and originality that was put into this film. I won't go around saying that everyone will enjoy this film because it's a confirmed fact that The Coen Brother's films are an aquired taste. Only the intellectually inclined will find this film to be a hilarious romp. But if you have an open mind, don't hesitate to give it a try.",1002585600,21,3345,4.889084507042254
1325112,5,B00003CXRM,"O Brother, Where Art Thou was a fantastically done movie.  The cinamatograpy was spectacular!  Although Hollywood seems to be stuck in a rut of remaking old classics, they sure hit a gold mine with this one!  I can't wait to buy this film!",1002153600,3,239,4.511627906976744
1325113,5,B00003CXRM,"I haven't seen many films in recent memory that I am so impressed by as the one I just watched this evening.  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is brilliant, not a word I use in reference to many American films.  Truly, the Coen Brothers are cinematic geniuses I now acknowledge!  ""Fargo"" was excellent, but not great as this one is.  I didn't see all five nominated films for Best Picture this year, but I cannot believe that ANY one was superior to this one.  Granted, the Coens were not marketing the film to the usual 14-year-old money-making mentality of most of the recent blockbuster American films, but  in its comedic brilliance, the Brothers skirt thither and yon with articulation rarely seen; they combine the best nuances of the Foreign Film with the power that American films can (but usually don't) produce.  The clever literary allusions crocheted tantalizingly with Southern Depression lore was excruciatingly
""to the point,"" and with refreshing originality (another rarity in Hollywood)!  And George Clooney--who'd have thought he could pull off such a role (one tends to remember him as that doctor on that tv program) deserved his honors, and, again, I cannot believe whoever it was who won the Oscar did a better job of acting. (Yes, Mr. Crowe, I mean it!)  Yes, the box office won again, which is the downside of American movie awards, it seems.
Clooney's two sidekicks hold their own, easily--actually, they do more than that:  they keep Clooney aloft!  Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter merely gild the lily.  Homer, indeed, is impressed, spinning in his grave, as he must be, to see ""The Odyssey"" in such a new, and invigorating, light.  With all the bravado and the zany activities, the Coens squeeze in, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, more than a few lessons in social significance, yet without preaching.  One doesn't have to be well-versed in this period of American history (although it must help to recognize the  allusions!) to appreciate the film.  Tomorrow I'm even buying the sound track, so remarkable it is.

I will admit, this is very different from other Coen films and it may be an acquired taste, but from the moment I turned it on I was hooked.  George Clooney is amazing.  He has a fantastic on-screen chemistry with every actor.  You can enjoy this without ever knowing the story of the Odessey, but I would recommend at least reading the cliff notes for it.  Knowing the Odessey makes the movie much more fun to watch.  The acting is wonderful, the story is classic, the writing is spectacular and the music is beautiful.

1325183,3,B00003CXRM,"I have two problems with this movie.  The first is that I found it relatively boring.  The only parts where I felt really involved with the movie were when there was music playing, so you might as well just get the soundtrack (which I've done).  George Clooney was kind of nice to look at, but I didn't care about the characters.  What a waste of John Turturro!  Not to mention Holly Hunter.
My second problem is more complicated.  As someone from New England who has grown to love the South, I was annoyed by the way accents seemed, in this movie, to be used to show the intelligence of the characters, with the smarter characters having less accent, the less smart ones more, and the downright stupid characters combining their thick thick accents with stuttering, gulping, and bugged-out, rolling eyes.  I should say that my friends in the South don't mind any of this, but that's probably because they don't live with this kind of charicature of the South on a daily basis as I do.  Maybe I'm being overly sensitive here, and maybe if I'd loved the movie otherwise I wouldn't have noticed it, but for me it cut too close to all the other times I've heard people use southern accents to indicate that someone is stupid, even if that person is actually from New England.",1001808000,2,1272,4.548245614035087
1325184,5,B00003CXRM,"...i think this is just about the best movie i've seen.  it's just a fun thing to watch and listen to.  it's based very loosely on the book ""the odyssey""...i haven't read that since like the 8th grade, so now i've gotta go back and check it out again so i can catch more of the references to it.
i've owned this dvd for about 3 weeks now, and i've watched it at least 14 times...i'm starting to hum these tunes in my sleep!!",1001721600,2,424,4.035714285714286
1325185,3,B00003CXRM,"I just watched this film and can say that I enjoyed it upon first viewing. It left me entertained and was very inventive and original, like most Coen brothers films. However, a rental might be the ideal way to go before buying to get a taste of the film or else it may leave a little to be desired. Those expecting ""Fargo 2"" just because this is by the Coens should go elsewhere.
Purportedly based on The Odyssey, the film can be enjoyed without any prior knowledge of that book. There are plenty of moments where the film left me confused, but you tend to overlook these things in a film like this. It can be enjoyed on two levels: as a story about 3 chain-gang escapees and there adventures, or as that coupled with the symbolic references to The Odyssey. Though some of the references aren't too difficult to associate with some basic knowledge of that work (the sirens, the cyclops), it would be pretty neat to have read the book and deduce the references to it.
The actors give good performances, although the characters are somewhat overshadowe by the humorous southern accents and odd situations they're put in. My main problems with the film is its characters as they don't seem to have much depth, especially John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson's characters. The main characters seem only to serve as mechanisms to further the plot by getting into sticky situations and then getting out of them again. Not a problem in a comedy, but I don't know if you can say this film fits completely under the comedy genre.
The DVD is pretty well done. The Painting with Pixels extra discusses how the filmmakers achieved the film's dry, burnt coloration and it's pretty cool; the look of the film is fabulous and really takes you to the Depression-era.  Also, the multi-angle feature comparing the film to its storyboards is well done (although your standard storyboard comparison), and the music video ""I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow"" is a good addition as well.
I only gave this film 3 stars because I can't justify giving it a better rating (maybe 3 1/2). It is enjoyable in an old-fashioned slapstick adventure way, and if you're a Coen brothers fan, this will probably be up your alley.  However, his film may be lost on a lot of people. Even if you're a fan of the Coens, it might be to your distaste. It's not a bad film, but if you often find yourself going ""What? What happened just then?"" a lot during a movie, you might want to skip this one.",1001721600,3,2447,4.546485260770975

If you like ""sleepers"" that have you rolling on the floor, then this is it! (By the way, 4 1/2 stars to O Brother to Let It Ride's 5 stars)",1001376000,,410,4.1375

The whole theme for the movie can be based off Homer's ""Oddisey"" or even ""Wizard of Oz"" as one reviewer conmmented before. But the real key to the heart of this movie is the goof nature of the characters: just as Joel Cohen says in the production featurette included in the DVD, the funny trio are like the ""Three Stooges.""
This has been one clever movie all through which I was able to laugh very hard, and the funniest thing about it is that it's not a comedy at all. More like the struggles of this runaway trio you sympathize with from the very start, to find some treasure that Ulysees Everett McGill (played by Clooney) buried before going to prison. Through their adventures they face the sirens call, they oppose the cyclops (Big Dan Teague, played by John Goodman) and hit local musical stardom not knowing about it with the song ""Man of constant sorrow.""
The acting is very solid: Clooney, Turturro and Nelson all play great roles. The cinematography, by Roger Deakins (long time film companion of the Cohen brothers), is even more outstanding: it is the first time the entire post-production of a film is done digitally. The process used for doing this is explained in extensive detail in a very interesting featurette included in the DVD.
Overall, deserving all the credit and the hype around it: it's an authentice masterpiece overall. Thanks to the Joel and Ethan Cohen for such good film making.",999993600,,1767,4.684887459807074

In 1940 at the age of 5, I saw Governor W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel at a street rally in Farmersville, TX. It is one of my earliest memories and obviously was impressive. It was just as depicted in the movie although I'm not sure the Texas Pappy O'Daniel was such a fool as Charles Durning's character. He, according to my older relatives, was a paragon in radio broadcasting during the '30's and probably had the force in Texas that Walter Cronkite did later nationally on TV. He was elected to head the state of Texas without any political experience. You Are My Sunshine also brought back memories of Jimmie Davis of Louisiana; living in East Texas,we heard his campaign broadcasts from the Shreveport radio station. The Down to the River to Pray segment brought back memories of my own baptism in a similar situation and the a capella singing of the choir was nothing short of beautiful.

What it also has, though, is several scenes that are nothing less than astonishing. At the top of my personal list (I'm sure you have or will have your own) is ""Down in the River to Pray."" I have not listened to the CD ""soundtrack"" of this movie, but, reading the reviews, I get the idea that Alison Krauss pretty much took over the song there. If true, that's a shame, but whether it is or not, the visual element is so strong -- and so essential to the subsequent progress of the movie -- that no audio-only rendering could possibly duplicate the experience of the DVD. In this scene, the faithful ""materialize"" out of the woods -- and out of your rear speakers if you have a surround system -- to involve you personally. In their white robes (which costumes are repeated later in somewhat less harmonious circumstances -- a ""coincidence"" that I'm sure was NOT lost on the Coens), the congregation represent the ingenuous best in depression-era southern culture.

Still, as is The Hudsucker Proxy, this film is whimsically amusing and highly stylized, though it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea. Fans of the Coen Brothers, however, will think that they have died and gone to heaven, when they see this, their latest film.
 The film takes place in Mississippi, the heart of the deep south, during the depression. Ulysses Everett McGill, charmingly played by George Clooney, who displays some real comedic talent, is a dapper dan of a fellow. Working on a chain gang, he escapes along with two other felons, disarmingly played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They are on their way to hunt up some buried treasure, the proceeds of a robbery, which McGill claims to know about. It later turns out that this was a mere ruse on the part of McGill, as he really had a different agenda.
 During their episodic odyssey, they encounter a motley crew of characters who brighten the cinematic landscape. The film also resonates with the sounds of blue grass and down home country music.

Who knew he had it in him?? It's one of those movies-which is rare-that you want to watch over and over. The music, along with the fine acting, made for an outstanding viewing and listening experience.

1325355,2,B00003CXRM,"""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?""  is ostensibly based on Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops?  Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.
Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it - slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original ""Odyssey"" was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  ""Oh Brother"" is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from ""The Odyssey"" and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.
So are there any good things to be found in ""Oh Brother""?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's.  And there is, of course, the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment.

To get all that is in this movie you need to own it.  The first viewing will just whet your appetite, if it doesn't trust me and watch it again.  You enjoyment will grow with each viewing.  The story centers around Everett McGill (Clooney) trying to get back to his wife and some buried treasure.  To accomplish this he brings his prison buddies who are shackled to him (Turtorro and Nelson).  This trio finds adventure and humor in the Klan, Bad politicians, loose women, backstabbing family, Bible salesmen, and all manner of quirky characters on their journey.  The characters are wonderful. The performances by the entire cast are fantastic.  This is not a George Clooney movie you have come to expect.  He is so different and fresh and funny you won't expect the performance you are seeing.  His costars are equally perfect. You will find yourself reciting lines from the movie that are bound to become classics.  On top of all this is the music.  This is bluegrass and oldtimey sounds.  I realize that most people are probably not fans of this type stuff and honestly neither was I, but the Coen brothers make it work.  The music is half the fun.  I find myself singing the songs around the house.  It is a movie that can be watched by the family.  There area  few bits of profanity, not too much but the story and the humor and especially the music can be enjoyed by everyone.",998265600,16,1516,4.565055762081784
1325357,5,B00003CXRM,"This is a great movie.  One of the best that I've seen all year.  I'm glad I read that it was based on Homer's Odyssey prior to watching it so that I could pick up on the subtle similarities (e.g. - the cyclops, sirens, etc.).  I watched it on DVD, but afterwards I wished I had seen it in the theaters!  The Coen brothers are great at creating their own world (look at Fargo) and developing the characters in that world.  ""O Brother"" is no exception.  I really thought I was walking, riding, and hitching a ride on a train in 1930's Mississippi!

1325358,5,B00003CXRM,"I stupidly let this go by when it was in theatrical release. Then one night I rented it on a whim and was blown away.

Some have made a great deal of this as a retelling of Homer's Odyssey.  My own thinking is that even though there is a ""cyclops"" and a scene with ""sirens"" and a few other superficial similarities with Homer this is really its own tale. I guess you could occupy yourself in identifying the various names as a kind of puzzle, but this really isn't the Odyssey in any deep way.  However, it is a lot of fun with great music and the humor is a delight from beginning to end. It is a movie I enjoy watching over and over again to catch little new things here and there.

It isn't a deep movie, it isn't particularly profound, and it isn't a laugh until you drop kind of comedy. But it is a bright comedy with intelligence and wit to spare. I have enjoyed watching it several times.  Don't miss it.",998092800,,911,4.153409090909091

1325360,3,B00003CXRM,"Just like the Cohen Brother's last effort, ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" suffers from the fact that it's wonderfully done with a vast amount of flair, but suffer's from an otherwise ""uneven"" story-structure, and rather pointless non-potent social commentary. Very well crafted and very well directed, it's an enjoyable experience, if not  a hilarious one at that. The perfomances are great, with John Goodman and Geroge Clooney coming out on top, not for all tastes, ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" is pure Cohen Brothers, and some of it's subject matter might upset a marginal pair audience. The films photgraphy is beautifully done as well, with it's symbolic browns and greens crused into one frame. It may not be in the Same League as their ""Blood Simple(1986) or ""Fargo(1994)""...but serves as a good companion piece to their second string ""The Big Lebowski"", both films that center around a pair of misfits who find themselves in the most non-ambiguous of situations.

But, after George Clooney (Dan Tyminski) sang at the radio station the movie just went down hill.  When the scene with the cows getting run over arrived I almost decided to turn it off, but my teenaged nephew asked to watch a bit more.  However, things just got more disappointing after that and we ended up turning it off before it finished.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

1325410,5,B00003CXRM,"I would rank this film as one of the Coen Brothers' best.  The premise (of relating Homer's Odyssey as the 1937 story of an escaped convict's journey to prevent his ex-wife from remarrying) is interesting, the dialogue is clever throughout, the cast is wonderful, and the music adds immeasurably to the entertainment.
Of special note, the Coens have been exceedingly generous in the extras offered to those who see the DVD.  A behind-the-scenes presentation features interviews and observations from the brothers as well as major actors and technical people; a music video of the breakaway single ""A Man of Constant Sorrow""; a documentary about the unique digital colorization techniques used for the film; and (my favorite) three scenes which can be run as a simulcast of the film with storyboard panels.  The cinematography and sets are beautiful.
This is what a DVD package *should* be!  If you like the Coen Brothers' previous work you should love this.  If you are interested in film as a creative endeavor, you will probably enjoy the film and the informative and fun extras.

A member of a Missouri Bluegrass Band told me this movie is a great showcase for bluegrass.  And it is.

Every Coen brothers movie is a marvel, but this one is just a gem.  It's hard to say what is so special about it.  The music -- American folk that has nothing in common with the electric ""country"" on the radio today -- is certainly unusual, and beautiful, and powerful.  The acting is wonderful.  The Coen brothers seem to get wonderful facial expressions out of everybody (the recording studio, Turturro boiling into anger), and I never realized George Clooney was such a wonderful actor.  The story has the zigzagging, zany quality that we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, laid over the Odyssey, and a sly humor that gets funnier every time you see the movie (""we thought you was a toad!"").

I am usually cautious about giving anything five stars, but in this case, I wish I could give six or seven. This is a fabulous movie: original (despite the fact that it's a retelling of The Odyssey), thoroughly entertaining, hysterical, and so different from the typical movie fare. The dialogue is excellent and the actors are fantastic. I was dubious about George Clooney's ability to play such a role, but he is perfect.

""Dapper Dan Pomade"" has to be the greatest invented product in a movie since ""Red Apple Cigarettes"" from ""Pulp Fiction"". Bad hair day? All you need is Dapper Dan and a hairnet. Boo-yaahhh!
The gopher-on-a-stick was pretty funny, as well. John Turturro's stint as a toad was also GENIUS ...I liked Clooney repeating the mantra ""We're in a tight spot!"" when a posse finds our heroes holed up in a barn. The movie looks great. Sounds great. Is great. Clooney's the pater familias, and the Devil has a red, bifurcated tail. You will LAUGH when Don't-Call-Him-Babyface Nelson kills cows, and you will LAUGH harder when the cows get their revenge!  The KKK-Dance Scene is just weird enough to merit a musical of its own:  perhaps the Coens should take it to the Great White Way in NYC and use it as an opener to Mel Brooks'  ""The Producers""!

1325482,4,B00003CXRM,"This movie is said to be loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey"". I guess ""loosely"" is a key word here; you won't find much Homeric imagery in this movie.
But one thing that does seem to be adapted from Homer is the style of the story, which is not so much a single plot as a succession of adventures loosely strung together. Here the Cohen brothers did a good job of constructing a series of adventures that are worth the telling, and are up to their usual standards of presentation.
I found the prominent use of bluegrass music throughout the movie a little hit-and-miss. It helped set the tone of the movie, but was somewhat distracting.",997401600,,635,4.530434782608696

1325486,4,B00003CXRM,"This is one of those movies that will have you shaking your head throughout, not because you don't understand it, but because you can't believe how the Coen brothers strung the scenes together.  Three convicts escape from a chain gang to search for a treasure their leader (George Clooney) vows to split with them.  This is the nearly invisible thread that holds the movie together; everything else feels like a series of unrelated bits - until the end, when most falls into place.
At first, Clooney's acting seemed terribly self-conscious and flat - I could understand only half of what he said because of mumbling delivery.  Soon, however, both he and I grew into his role as the fast-talking, pomade-obsessed, singing leader of the gang.  Holly Hunter, as his wife, steals every scene she's in; Hunter plays this small part with just the right mix of spunk and self-righteousness.
The Ku Klux Klan scene has to be seen to be believed.  I didn't know whether to laugh or be horrified - the true mark of the Coen brothers.
Although the soundtrack seems to be better known than the movie itself, the film deserves attention in its own right.  If you're looking for something offbeat, this is your film.",997228800,7,1202,4.7548076923076925

It follows the journey of three chain-gang escapees, searching for a treasure that will help them get their lives back on track. What they encounter and find on their journey is unexpected, but all the more entertaining.
Though this film seem's very strange at times, when one considers that it is based on such a early epic as ""The Odyssey"", it is easy to understand why it appears this way. Upon closer attention, you realize that the way the story is adapted from the original is clever and engaging. Not to mention, at times hilariously funny. The film also succeeds with its strange but fitting acting, and its beautiful settings.

The best part of the movie was its ability to put you into the feel of the south/midwest back in the 1920/1930 depression era.  The movie had a slap-stick-like humor and somewhat corny but very cute dialog.  The best part of the movie, I felt, was the cinematography and dialog, which wonderfully placed one back in the early 1920-1930's.  I did not find the movie very funny, but did find it somewhat 'charming' due to the mood and theme.
However, the average IQ of every character in the entire movie did not break double digits.  The slap-stick style humor and consistent monotony of the theme, in my opinion, gets old very quick.
Overall, I find this movie fairly charming in its setting and theme, but the slapstick-style humor I did not find very funny.  Much of the time I was very straight faced, often annoyed.

What we have here is a wonderful narrative of three very individual prople, escaping from prison (but ""nice guys"" so it's OK). Most of their collective motive is greed, but some great bonding ensues, friendships develop (new & old), conflicts happen, etc. Put it in the hands of Joel & Ethan Coen and you have (another) unique blend of movie-making and thought-provoking controlled insanity. I loved this film! What a pleasure to see John Turturro in a somewhat under-control performance. I'm not sure that I've ever heard of Tim Blake Nelson, but he's a brilliant actor (best in the film, I think), truly supporting an incredible performance from George Clooney. The two were a real ""pair"". Another reason I avoided this film was it's Oscar nomination for screenplay in the ""adapted"" category (suggesting its basis as Homer's Odyssey!). How presumptuous, I thought. Well,leave it to the Coen's. I don't know any mistake they've ever made in a movie: ""Blood Simple"", best murder mystery ever, ""Raising Arizona"", second best comedy ever; ""Miller's Crossing"", second-best gangster movie ever; and ""Fargo"", their best ""everything"" movie. I love the Coen's (though I admit I still don't understand ""Barton Fink"", though it was a wonderfully scathing comment on the Hollywood movie-making process).There's a continuing, innate sweetness about this film, though it pulls no punches. The Ku Klux Klan is presented as too organized and with political overtones...which may be true, and which may be the Coen's idea to expose this group as heartless and evil as they are (and, especially, were back in the 30's). Tackling some outrageously seriously themes, the Coen's have once again succeeded in making the ugliest of reality seem to be amusing and utterly entertaining. It must be very tough to make light of some of the most horrible moments in history...Mel Brooks did it and so did Benigni; Billy Wilder (Stalag 17) & Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove). One must admire the creativity & control involved, so as to not offend, present your material and have it accepted.

Scenery is breathtaking in the film. John Tuturro is a hoot and so is Tim Blake-Nelson. What a voice he's got. I always love Holly Hunter in everything and John Goodman is perfect as the conman/bible salesman. I want to watch it over and over to see what I missed the first time.

For example, turning Tiresias the prophet into an old blind African American Railroad worker, or Polyphemus the Cyclops into a con man/Bible salesman with an eye-patch. The movie is full of humor that anyone would love. I'm fourteen and I loved it, my sister, an eighteen year old, loved it, and both of my parents loved it. If you liked this movie, I also recommend ""Raising Arizona,"" ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" and almost any other Coen Brothers movie.

I find this movie very entertaining and while not totally historically accurate, who cares?  It was one of those movies that left you feeling good.  As for the music, I'm a Ralph Stanley fan (who wrote or recorded a lot of the songs in the movie) and I love Dan Tyminski (who is the voice you here when Clooney supposedly sings.  Dan was once a member of Allison Krauss and Union Station) and I have followed him for years.  How refreshing to hear Dan's voice coming from George Clooney's mouth!!  At first I didn't think that George would be able to pull off this role, but he did a fantastic job as Ulysses Everett McGill.

1325611,3,B00003CXRM,"It sounds cool, right? The Coen Brothers (""Fargo,"" ""The Big Lebowski"") doing a retelling of Homer's The Odyssey, set in depression-era Mississippi, filled with a stellar soundtrack, the usual Coen cast plus George Clooney, and an homage to Preston Sturges. And it is pretty cool, but it's not great, and perhaps doesn't live up to its expectations. Undeniably, the music in the film is fantastic, and the soundtrack album is well worth buying. Clooney turns in a great performance in his first outing with the Brothers, and John Turturro, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman are great as well. Any fan of Homer or Sturges would be proud. However, the movie seems to fall short of what the viewer wants. It lacks the humor and the precise attention to complex and fascinating characters that we found in previous Coen Brothers films. The three bumbling escapees (Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Clarke Duncan) are the expected dim-witted good-hearted Southerners, and in the course of their odyssey to uncover the $1.2 million that Clooney stole and buried, meet a fanciful enough cast of weirdos. There's no laugh-out-loud oddballisms, no endearingly pathetic losers, no poorly thought out crime capers, to keep us really engaged. If it weren't for the music, I'd have checked out. In short, the film's worth seeing, but not keeping. Hey, we can't expect the best of these guys all the time.",995155200,3,1381,5.008695652173913

1325652,3,B00003CXRM,"I have to admit, I love movies by the Coen Brothers.  They're responsible for great movies like ""Fargo"", ""Raising Arizona"", and ""Big Lebowski"".  I just watched this movie a couple of days ago, and well...  It was interesting.
Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a pretty clever comedy for the most part.  Clooney and two other prisoners have escaped and are looking for buried treasure.  Along the way, they run into some very interesting characters and unpredictable situations at every corner.  This movie is based on ""Oddesy"" by Homer, except it all takes place in a different time.  A good example is John Goodman who plays a one-eyed Bible salesman, who of course resembles the Cyclops.  (Even though he was only in the movie for a small portion, I thought he had one of the best parts.)  George Clooney also does a superb job, and in fact, we even get to hear him sing.
This was a clever comedy, but I felt that some parts were a little slow and hard to understand.  Some parts were more confusing than funny.  It's just not your typical Coen film, and maybe I expected a little more.
Maybe this is one of those movies you have to see a second time to fully appreciate it for what it stands for.  There is some outstanding acting and twists along the way, and there are plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy.  You may want to get familar with some of the ""Oddesy"" before you see this movie.  My advice, rent it first before buying it.  It's an odd comedy that isn't for everyone.  There's more intelligent humor than toilet humor in this movie.
All in all, I thought ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" was a good movie, but I still think that ""The Big Lebowski"" is by far the best Coen movie out there.",994896000,2,1706,4.419871794871795
1325653,5,B00003CXRM,"This movie is best on DVD.  The extra material on the single DVD includes the trailer, the music video of ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,"" a ""making of.."" featuring directors/writers/producers Ethan and Joel Coen and ""Painting with Pixels,"" an intriguing look at the use of computers in making this feature.  While most of the colateral material is the standard stuff, the Painting with Pixels is an interesting foray into the use of computers to create effects on screen and the treatment of the film when completed.  Cinematographer Rodger Deakins explains his job creating the final cut, then the computer artists take over, working with him to get a unique look and feel for the entire film.  I was amazed at the information in this piece.
The Coen Brothers generously credit Homer with the top writing credit.  Homer, a Greek poet, wrote The Odessy, upon which the film is loosely base.  Joel and Ethan added the Three Stooges and the Depression-era South, swirled in some instantly likable bluegrass music and came up with a winner of movie.
The film begins with the escape of our heros from a chain gang in the backwoods of Mississippi.  Our adventurers are supposedly in pursuit of 1.2 million dollars buried at the home of this Ulysess (George Clooney).  Clooney plays a wonderful Moe Howard, always willing to throw in an esoteric word or two to liven the conversation.  His buddies John Turturro (Larry) and Tim Blake Nelson (Curley) and he try to escape the movie's antagonist, beautifully underplayed by Daniel von Bargen (seemingly straight out of Cool Hand Luke).
During their escapades our trio mixes it up with three ""sirens"" (singing the most alluring version of the old black lullaby ""Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby"" that I have ever heard), a church choir, a ""cyclops"" (John Goodman with a eye-patch, stealing his scenes with panache) and the Ku Klux Klan.
Don't look for historical accuracy in this film.  The Klan was never noted as either good dancers or good chanters and ""Baby Face"" Nelson dies in a hail of bullets not the electric chair.
But the Coen Brothers aren't reaching out for accuracy.  They are looking for pure entertainment and they achieve this goal.

OBWAT captures the American culture in a much more colorful and deeper way than ""Fargo"" does. It addresses governance; in some obvious ways, but also more subtly, alluding to the effects of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), with it's zeal for dam- building on the lives of landowners. Any reader/watcher of the popular ""Cadillac Desert"" book/PBS-series would catch that.
But what has this to do with Tarkovsky? Yes, what about the religious procession in the forest to the river? What about the hope and optimism that Clooneys character? The quest for redemption?

This movie is a quirky adventure which features three escaped convicts (George Clooney and his two bumbling counterparts) who experience an epic adventure together.
Overall, the plot is quite simple (as is many aspects of the movie), but it is full of interesting scenes and witty dialogue.  I was really surprised by how well that George Clooney pulled off his role, and how funny some of the rather bizarre scenes turn out.  The soundtrack was also quite good, which was a nice bonus, especially considering the fact that I am not a big bluegrass fan.
I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys offbeat comedy, especially with a Southern flair to it.  The movie is supposed to represent Mississippi back in the 30s, and pokes fun at some cultural icons from that era (to include the Klan).",994636800,3,914,4.6521739130434785
1325660,3,B00003CXRM,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2000)

First and foremost: the person who decided that the score for this film needed nominating for an Oscar should be boiled in lead. Even if some of the other pieces therein were engaging, catchy, etc., the version of ""I'll Fly Away"" that ""graces"" this soundtrack is the very resurrection of the shrieking out-of-tune harridans whose off-key warbling made the soundtracks to so many fifties and sixties musicals unlistenable. Even worse, whatever infernal power resurrected them allowed the decay of forty years of neglect to stay in their vocal cords, and they sound worse than ever.

All right, aside from that, this movie was kinda fun. Far more mainstram than one expects from the Brothers Coen, especially with the nose-thumbs they presented society with in their last film, the brilliantly funny Fargo (1996). But they do go on to assert, and with enough backing to make it believable, that no, mainstream does not have to equal crap. They do this mostly the way they always do it-- by getting the finest possible ensemble cast to worm its way through their twisted scripts.

In this case, Jason and his Argonauts (you did know it's based-- very, very loosely-- on The Odyssey, right?) are George Clooney, an unrecognizable John Turturro, and the slightly more recognizable Tim Blake Nelson, last scene in yet another cameo in The Thin Red Line. (Nelson's been spending more time behind the
camera these days, having recently finished directing _O_, the newest film retelling of the Bard's play Othello.) They are besieged and beset by some of the more memorable characters from Homer's work, most notably a Cyclopean John Goodman and Michael Badalucco as Babyface Nelson (I know, given the number of roles this guy had, I shouldn't keep referring to him as ""the guy who played Davey Zifrin on Law and Order,"" but jeez, he was SO good in that role...). Add in Holly Hunter, fresh from a stint in the indie world, as Clooney's wayward wife, and you've got a fun little flick. It probably won't be remembered as the height of the Brothers Coen's career, but if you turn the sound off during ""I'll Fly Away,"" it's a worthy enough addition to the corpus.",994636800,,2208,4.835978835978836
1325661,4,B00003CXRM,"Movie Summary:  It's the 1930's in Mississippi and Ulysses Everett McGill has just escaped from a chain gang. He still has part of the chain and it attaches him to his fellow inmates Pete and Delmar. Together this threesome is trying to recover a buried treasure before it is covered by the new lake that will be formed when the river is damned. Along the way they meet a Cyclops, sirens, and a soulless guitar player. They hitch a ride with George Nelson (don't you dare call him ""baby face""!) and form the Soggy Bottom Boys. All the while being chased by a devil of a prison guard.
My Opinion:  This is an offbeat movie. Not only is the story different, but the entire feel and color of the movie is different. While some people may have problems dealing with the differentness of this film, I found it very refreshing. It was fun to watch a movie that had themes, motifs, and allusions to other classic stories. I enjoyed the story and the music very much. The Soggy Bottom Boys know how to rock! George Clooney is in great form. He always plays himself in every movie, but there is nothing wrong with that. He fits in great here. It was even fun to see the Dapper Dan Man making fun of himself.

1325725,5,B00003CXRM,"Homer's Odyssey, re-figured as a myth of the Depression-era South... and a satire... and a love song.  O Brother is in my Top 5.
What ties this movie together is the intelligence that pours out of every frame and every line of dialog.  (Think ""Rushmore"").  Slice this movie along any axis:
 - Intellectualism / Book Learnin'.  It's based on Homer's Odyssey -- Come on!  Top that off with dozens of quasi-historical references that I don't even get.
 - Satire.  It goes from big and blunt (""The KKK Scene"" is the best KKK treatment I've ever seen) to so subtle and detailed that you barely notice it (look at the earnestness on Delmar's face when he sings ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow""!)  But how can the movie be a satire when it revels so much in the lush mythology and history (good and bad) of Mississippi?
 - Music.  More perfectly woven into this movie than any I've seen.  (And no it doesn't hit you over the head like musicals do.)  It sounds trite, but you *will* be singing these songs after the movie.  And you might even want to buy the soundtrack and put it next to your Radiohead CDs.
 - Cinematography.  Just gorgeous.
 - Acting.  In some ways the weakest part of the movie -- George Clooney was great, but only got to 95%.  John Goodman was... John Goodman.  But for some characters, brilliant.  I absolutely believed that Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) was a dumb hick, even though I know it's impossible.  And the blind Radio Station Man (Stephen Root aka Milton the Red Stapler Guy from Office Space) was genious.
 - Beauty.  See Music and Cinematography.
 - Dialogue.  It takes the deepest intelligence to write this way.  Strongly characterized, referential, regional, colloquial, and so so funny.  Ulysses' rhetoric is priceless.  And Delmar's southernisms slip in so smoothly that you forget to ask - how did two brothers from Minnesota write this?
 - Cheer Factor.  Damn!  Those boys can sing!
And it's funny as hell.

1325728,5,B00003CXRM,"One of the biggest draws to this wonderful movie is the way the Coen brothers where able to give a unique sense of style and location to this period piece.  From the wonderful cinematography to the highly acclaimed soundtrack, the viewer gets a a stylized version of the southern U.S. of the 1930s.  The storyline, roughly based on the Oddysey, goes throughout the land in a somewhat haphazard, but madcap way.  It's not the end result of the plot that matters, though, it's the journey.  As with other Coen brothers films, the dialogue and regional dialect is a big draw, with the great cast delivering tons of quirky, hilarious sayings.  One note, however, with many Coen movies, I've noticed people seem to love them or hate them.  O Brother might not be everyone's cup of tea, though after many a repeated veiwing, I find it wonderful.  Aside from the film, getting the soundtrack would be quite worthwhile as well.

A good comic performance from the usualy flacid Clooney, usual brilliance from Turturro, and the best of the three, Tim Blake Nelson tie this Homer-based epic together. The synthesis of the writing, directing, and acting was complete and that is at the very heart of good theatre/film- the point when you can't tell who is responsible for the brilliance you are watching.  The Coens have outdone themselves with this hugely comic and ultimately moving romp that leaves nothing left untied, and no plots left unwrapped and explained. Nothing in this film is there without meaning and purpose.  A hillarious supporting performance from John Goodman is only one of the many laurels this film holds in it's ever so eccentric boughs. Immediately arriving on my top ten films list, besides being brilliant, this film inadvertantly contains on of my favorite sequences in film- a thrilling mix of the KKK, the wizard of oz, and a busby-berkley parody.  The Coens have yet to do a commentary track (that being my favorite DVD aspect) but the producers of this DVD have covered it with other goodies- two featurettes and a couple of smaller behind the scenes type deals.

1325773,4,B00003CXRM,"In their latest film, O Brother Where Art Thou?, the Coen Brothers use their quirky mix of humour and high brow production to satirize Homer's The Odyssey.  Set in depression era south, the film is the comic saga of three convicts on the run done only as the Coen's can.
Like all of their other films, this one contains an ensemble cast of characters unique and compelling.  First, we have Ulysses Everett Mcgill (played to the hilt by George Clooney), a smooth talking man with a streak of vanity a mile wide.  He has a tendency to repeat things (as most Coen characters do) and has a thing for his hair and hair pomade.  George's performance shows he is an actor capable of true greatness.  Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance is beyond me.  The good thing is it garnered a Golden Globe for him, and was well earned.
John Turturro makes an appearance in this film as well (seems like he is in almost every Coen film).  Here he plays the serious side kick named Pete and delivers a great performance in this role.  The best part is his reaction to The Sirens.  Not quite as good as his performance in The Big Lebowski (that was the best!) but nonetheless, quite good.
All of this is set against a backdrop of beautiful scenery and wonderful cinematography thanks to longtime Coen Brother's collaborator Roger Deakins.  Once again the technical aspect of the film is right on the money, the film is stylish without being campy.

I don't ever feel that George Clooney is ever believeable in anything he has done, from ER to this. He appears to be acting the part instead of being ""in"" the part, and being believable in his role.",993859200,,460,4.179775280898877

George Clooney is very appealing and likeable in this little oddball film. It grows on you after you get used to its style and music.

Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have really captured something here. I find their films fascinating. There is some amount of magic and unwritten sense of order in the world that Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have created in this film.

Add in the cutting-edge cinematography, the era-capturing soundtrack, and Coen Brother's keen directing, and it's worthy of watching time and time again...A rare quality in today's films. I own a lot of DVD's...this is my new favorite! Now, I'M A DAPPER-DAN MAN!",993686400,4,547,4.89247311827957
1325834,5,B00003CXRM,"""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is a wonderful film, especially if you accept it on its own terms instead of judging it by any personal preconceptions such as what a depression-era story should say, or how faithful and accurate a modern interpretation of the Odyssey should be. The film has a light-hearted goofiness to be sure, but this is part of its charm and part of what makes it work.
Oh Brother is the story of three escaped convicts lead by the garrulous Ulysses Everett McGill. On their way to McGill's buried treasure, the convicts experience the Cohen brothers' twisted and hilarious versions of the blind soothsayer, the sirens, the Cyclops, and other Homeric characters. Both the Homeric characters and ensuing events hardly follow those of the Odyssey itself. In fact, they are more like road markers in the film than elements in the plot structure. In the end, Ulysses' wins his duel with his wife, Penelope's suitors not with physical prowess but with music. These characters are mixed with some Southern legends such as a ""baby faced"" serial bank robber who does it for the thrill and a talented black guitarist who claims to have traded his soul to the devil for his musical gift.
Music is in fact the universal current of this film, which begins with a chain gang singing as they break rocks on the side of the road. Music draws the convicts to baptismal ceremonies in the woods and to the treacherous arms of the sirens. It enables them to con money from a blind radio station owner and ultimately proves to be their salvation. Some reviewers have commented that music provides this film with most of its artistic and thematic depth, and I agree with them. Just as the Cohen brothers seem to take their light hearted, Southern stereotypes a little too far, the music reorients us to the fact that these are real people living in a time of intense misery and struggle.
Some people may not like this film because the convicts lack depth of character. But I think the convicts are not meant to appeal to us with realism as much as they are a throwback to 30's era films.  There is something fantastic and whimsical about this film but I think this will only bother people who expect the film to take itself seriously. ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is an exploration of Homeric themes, Southern culture, the impact of music, and a bygone era of film making. The Cohen brothers chose to do this with ironic whimsy, which may understandably irritate some people, but which worked for me.",993600000,9,2495,4.683371298405467

1325838,4,B00003CXRM,"Oddly enough I did not know this film was based on the Oddysey. But when telling someone about it, I described it as an oddysey, in that the heroes travel from place to place and meeting strange and sometimes famous people with whom they champion their way through difficulties.  Because of the title and the poster images, a lot of people think this is a rather heavy film with some humor. If you want to get a bead on what this film is most similar to in flavor and in its unfolding I would say Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It is laugh out loud funny very early on. And as a bonus you get to listen to a really outstanding soundtrack you may even want to own. I was talking over the film with a friend and we both agreed this was George Clooney's best and most likeable role to date. Perhaps John Turturo's as well. So if you are not fond of either of these actors, set your reservations aside. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou became popular through word of mouth. The audience I saw the film with really was enjoying this film, especially the ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" segment, and you should have a good time as well.",993427200,2,1111,4.29047619047619
1325839,5,B00003CXRM,"One of the most enjoyable movies I've seen - funny, uplifting, thought-provoking.  But, you must have familiarity with The Odyssey, and DEFINITELY have an understanding of the Depression-era rural south, and southern culture in general, in order to appreciate the rich and subtle substance of the film.  If you don't, watching this movie is a poor use of your time.  In direct contradiction to comments from some who apparently fail to meet these criteria: the music is simply marvelous (again, if you enjoy the harmonies and lyrics of bluegrass and folk music), the dialogue (particulary Clooney's part) is witty, and the stereotypes (and allusions to other films) are both necessary and delicious, and clever as well. This is most certainly not a racist film and the point is NOT the 'plot'. Yes, there are a few rough spots and historical inaccuracies. But, they are trivial. This movie is an testament to the talent of the Coens, and far better than Fargo, which had a dark and bizarre side!",993340800,,995,4.910714285714286

But if you are into their movies because of the lovable characters or just the general ""feel to it"", ou should have a go. It is not as violent or dark as Miller's Crossing or Fargo, not as sharp as Big Lebowski, but it is so sympatethic that you can't go wrong with it. There are still funny characters in it, although nothing quite hilarious as Jesus Quintana, Mike Yanagita, Marge Gunderson or Carl Showalter. The best thing in it is the music; ""Man Of Constant Sorrow"" , for example, stucked to my head instantly, although my musical taste is usually far from roots or bluegrass. Only if you are a Homer's Odyssey purist, you might be dissappointed, because although it is loosely based on it, it's far cry from it, really. This is probably the best Coen movie for those who don't even like Coen brothers' films. Highly recommended.",993340800,2,959,4.517241379310345

Don't think you will not like this movie because you don't like bluegrass music.  By the time the movie is over, you will and I would recommend that you order the sound track CD at the same time you are buying this.

1325886,5,B00003CXRM,"This was by far the best movie I saw this year. In addition to its musical, comedic, and acting merits, I wanted to point out its literary merits, which are slightly underneath the surface but are there nonetheless if you are looking for them.
 This movie is not merely an adaptation of The Odyssey, it is a very viable literary interpretation of it. Bringing out Ulysses' vanity, self-reliance, and persuasuve ability as well as Penelope's stubbornness and fickle nature, which this film does beautifully, have been important in all interpretations of the classical poem.
Satire of the work is also not lost on the Coens. Ulysses is transformed from the sacker of Troy to a fraudulent lawyer, his athletic prowess turns into him getting beaten up by a weakly looking suitor, and even the authors' use of the name Homer is intended and appropriately satiric. (for a full-of-himself politician who looks out for ""the little man"")
For those who think that this is indeed merely a loose adaptation and that the events and persons of the Odyssey are not put into this movie, I would contend that they are very much mistaken.
Without giving anything away, I would challenge viewers to find the Coens' interpretation of all of the following characters from the poem (the first few are easy): Odysseus, Penelope, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Circe (and her turning of Ulysses' men into animals), the Cattle of the Sun, King Alcinous of Phaecia, the angry god Poseidon (who here is also the ruler of Hades), the ghosts of Hades, the Lotus Eaters, Aeolus, the Laestrygonians, Alcinous' blind bard Demodocus, Eurylochus (Ulysses' unfaithful first-mate), Elpenor (his man who he meets in Hades), Telemachus, and Eumaeus the swineherd, Tiresias (the blind seer of Hades), the suitors Eurymachus and Antinous, and finally the representations of the monstrous Scylla and the water guzzling Charybdis.
They are all there. I'm not making them up. Watch the movie again if you have to. Good luck and enjoy!",993168000,,1985,4.996978851963746
1325887,4,B00003CXRM,"I guess this movie is supposed to be some kind of modern day Homer's Oddessey.  I never read it, but I've heard that it's a bit similar, but not completely like it.  It stars George Clooney who really surprised me in this movie! I am not much of a fan, and I thought he was very good as the prisoner who breaks loose from a chain gang.  He's kind of the one is charge, and the two men he drags along don't want him to be the one who's boss. One is played by John Turtorro, and well, honestly I have no idea who the other actor is, but he is very good and extremely funny in this movie  They are all on the lam together, and as Clooney is trying to get back to his wife and family the thre of them have adventures -- not all good ones.  They even start a singing career as the Soggy Bottom Boys.  All the songs are old folk and blue grass songs, and the actors lip synch.  I really thought it was Clooney singing the first time I saw this!  The singing and dancing really brings great delight to this very sunny little movie. It kind of reminded me of The Wizard of Oz in that way.  There is even one scene where they view KKK members marching around while hiding behind a bush.  They eventually manage to get three of the members and steal their uniforms to save a man from being killed...In the wizard of Oz, the three friends of Dorothy watch the henchmen for the witch march around and eventually steal uniforms from three of the men.  There is even similar chanting in O Brother... I don't want to give anything else away, but JOhn Goodman plays one of the many people they meet along their journey, and Stephen Root, who is a very funny character actor(the boss on Newsradio) plays a blind dj, who made me howl with laughter. Holly Hunter is in it as Clooney's estranged wife Penelope. The best thing I really loved about this movie is the music.  I bought the soundtrack the next day, and it is awesome.  If you are fan of folk and bluegrass, you'll absolutely love this soundtrack.  It's a very funny film that is well acted and beautifully filmed.  The Coen ""brothers"" have made another excellent film.  I also love the way the film is made to look like it is an old movie, with the coloring that is used.  It really adds to it. I highly recommend this one..IT's defintely worth buying.",993081600,,2294,4.248847926267281
1325888,2,B00003CXRM,"I really wanted to like this movie, but.....I thought it was meaningless and boring. Maybe that was the attraction...movies like this allow people to feel smart! I felt like the Coens were testing my ""coolness"" factor!
The peripheral characters were there for what reason? To take up time? Must have been, because they had absolutely no impact or relationship to the action of the movie. Their presence was totally random.
I thought that the entire film made fun of the South and Southerners (and no, I am not one). And what was the point of the cow being hit by a car? That was cruel and thoughtless. Did they think it was funny?
The sepia cinematography was gorgeous. That is the best thing I can say about this movie.

1325889,5,B00003CXRM,"I've got to take back an earlier assessment of mine that George Clooney can't act.  He does a wonderful acting job in this movie and no one could have been more suprised than I was to discover him as an actor. Clooney forms a trio, along with John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, of fugitives from a chain gang in Depression era Mississippi. This is the ultimate road movie with characters throughout that could have only come from the Coens' incredible imaginations.  Real life is even interspered throughout with the trio catching a ride, for example, with ""Baby Face Nelson,"" the notorious manic-depressive bank robber. Ulysses Everett McGill is the name of Clooney's slick con man character and this is because this story is a retelling of the ""Odyssey"" via the Coen brothers.

Homer and the Coens together are a delightful combination, much more enjoyable than my reading of the source work back in high school.  The soundtrack of music from this era is fabulous too.  Our trio can even sing and makes a impressive debut as the ""Soggy Bottom Boys.""  There are so many great scenes in this film that I could go on and on but I'll just highlight a few.  There is a Klu Klux Klan rally musical number that is only rivaled by ""Springtime For Hitler"" in ""The Producers.""  It is a superb music and dance number of the proposed lynching of a black man!

Then there is the biblical flood that looms over all but in this case is the creation of the TVA dam.  The Coens manage to make creation of the TVA into high comic film art, no small feat. The trio also runs into the Sirens, just like happens in the epic poem.  In this case they are three damsels washing in the river and singing who beguile the trio.  From this encounter flows the comic wonder of Tim Blake Nelson over his belief that the sirens may have transformed Turturro into a frog. This is a must see film for everyone.

1325890,5,B00003CXRM,"This is the first film I can remember that starred the musical arranger.  While there are many very, very good things in this film it is dominated by its soundtrack, and well after seeing the movie, after you have forgotten the characters and what they said, you will vividly remember the music.  Burnett also was the musical director for THE BIG LEBOWSKI, and I was tremendoulsy impressed in that one with his musical selections, especially the hysterical Spanish language version of ""Hotel California.""  But Burnett outdid himself in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?  All of the songs were newly recorded for the film, but each one felt as if it had stepped right out of the 1920s or 1930s, when they were all written.  Every single one of the songs was memorably and magnificently performed, in particular the great traditional song ""Man of Constant Sorrows,"" whose unexpected success on the radio plays a major role in the movie's plot.
(Sidenote:  anyone who loved the version of ""Man of Constant Sorrows"" in this film owes it to themselves to search out a CD with the Stanley Brothers performing this song.  Ralph Stanly in fact performed one of the songs in the move:  the eerie ""Oh Death"" performed at the KKK ralley.  The Stanley Brothers consisted of Ralph and his slightly older brother Carter.  As good as Ralph is, Carter Stanley, who unfortunately died in 1966, had almost without question the greatest voice in the history of Bluegrass.  And absolutely no one ever sang ""Man of Constant Sorrows"" better than Carter Stanley.  Whereas Ralph possesses a fine voice that is somewhere between a low tenor and a high baritone, Carter possessed a high, brilliant, piercing tenor that is one of the glories of American folk music.)
The music alone makes this a great movie.  Without it, the movie would have lost a lot of its cohesion and texture.  I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, but if you take away the music, this film would probably rate as their weakest film yet with the exception of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  The film on its own doesn't quite cohere at every moment, and there are some moments that are just flat out weak.  But as a whole, the movie has a tremendous period feel and a wealth of great minor characters.
I thought George Clooney excelled as an escaped convict with a penchant for Dapper Dan hair pomade and sentences that make him sound considerably smarter than he is.
So, my recommendation is twofold:  first, see and enjoy the movie.  Second, run out and buy the soundtrack!  This movie just might have the best movie soundtrack to have come out in several years.",993081600,,2591,4.70509977827051

Lines like ""We thought they done luved you up and turned yall into a toad!"" or ""Daddy, Momma said you got hit by a train"", when taken in context will make you roar. It a delightful comedy with a bit of ""Cool Hand Luke"" thrown in for good measure (chain gang, ""man with no eyes"" sunglass wearing guard, bungling fellow escapees). There's even a bit of the ""Wizard of Oz"" at a KKK meeting. Remember the evil witches guards marching and singing. Well it's here too!

1325893,4,B00003CXRM,"This is a rental. Clooney and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances, and the writing is quite good. But this movie doesn't stick in your mind like the Coens' better efforts.
Great movies have moments that stick with you long after the movie is done. In ""Barton"", it's the flaming hotel hallway with John Goodman on a murderous rampage walking through it. In ""Fargo"", it's a pregnant policewoman walking through snow drifts; a desperate woman trying to escape from kidnappers while wrapped in a shower curtain; a man being fed into a woodchipper.
This movie, while fun, and at some points quite funny, just comes up short on those kind of moments. Pretty good, just not great.",992908800,,684,4.708333333333333
1325932,2,B00003CXRM,"Tagged as the team of the consummate quirky movie, the Coen brothers' newest release, Oh Brother Where Art Though, is one supposes their clever reconstruction of Homer's Odyssey with a heavy sprinkling of blue grass music.
In it three connected members of a chain gang go on a journey for treasure that George Clooney's character, Ulysses Everett McGill, says he has hidden. His partners played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson complete the ensemble of misfits.
There are some readily recognizable episodes from the Odyssey imaginatively set in the 1930's South. The most pleasing is John Goodman as the Cyclops. The music is placed throughout the movie and seems a natural counterpart to the performance. The movie is well acted and constructed.
However, as with all the Coen films, their humour is inevitably at the expense of a disadvantaged demographic. Their films habitually exploit the setting and people in rural, geographically depressed areas. What is funny about this? It is pity that they feel they have the right to mine this material in the first place, and it is a pity that their imaginations cannot extend beyond it.
There is a limited appeal to the Coen films which I'm sure they rationalize as being misunderstood by the wider audience. In plain fact the audience recognizes the films as meanly comical and wildly stereotypic and chooses not to go. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou is only another sugar-coated extension of this meanness.",992908800,3,1456,5.020661157024794

Notice that the three overtake three guards (aka monkeymen) and are on a quest to save a decent person (blues singer - Dorothy).  The fire is a predominant factor in hurting the singer (Witch's broom on fire).  My first thought was that this scene was lifted from the Wizard of Oz rather than the Busby Berkeley aspects, the later of which are apparent in the choreography of the march scene.  Otherwise, there are many layers of tributes to old films which added to my enjoyment - my family's film of 2000.",992822400,3,604,4.454545454545454

So I said what the heck and bought the last one. Boy were the critics wrong! This is a superb movie. It is rich and vibrant with color along with humor and a great story. Since it was based on the Odyssey by Homer, (which we read in Englis class), I found it fun figuring out who all the charachters were. Not only is this film fun, clever, and exciting, but it also has a deeper, less notable undelaying theme mocking todays society. I hope you go out and buy this movie no matter what anybody says. The only problem with this film is some of the charachtor's southern accents are hard to understand (me being from connecticut and all) so I had to turn on the sub-titles one in a while.

They must reach the treasure before a dam is completed and the treasure further buried beneath a man-made lake. Thus begins an episodic quest in which the trio confronts numerous odd and interesting characters and situations before they find a treasure more valuable than the millions they seek. The Cyclops, the Sirens, the fight with Penelope's suitors: all these adventures and more from the Oddyssey are recreated in offbeat style. The songs and music are dead on, and the movie's evocation of the rural South is realistic and idyllic at the same time. One scene where a speaker truck drove the backroads blaring out country music and political solicitations struck home to me. Riding as a child in just such a truck is my earliest remembrance of Southern politics.
Graphic violence, graphic sex, surreal computer generated special effects, potty mouth dialog, heavy-handed messages on ""politically correct"" issues, commercials interwoven into the plot. A little of the foregoing can be tolerated, but in much of modern moviedom these features overpower the plot. ""O Brother"" is definitely out of step with the trends of modern film making.

BTW -- the music is as wonderful as I've heard.  I am not particularly a blue grass fan, but I may be now!  I'm just not sure whether to buy the sound track or the movie first!",992649600,,743,4.111111111111111

1326018,5,B00003CXRM,"Set in the depressed South, this strange, somewhat mystical comedy delivers much to ponder. Such as: George Clooney's ""modern,"" ""sophisticated"" character, vain and verbose, is contrasted to the simple spirituality of his jailbreak companions, and of the era, and is found wanting; his agnosticism falters in the face of death, and, having been spared, reverts back to his unbelief; his companions are ""holy fools,"" who find their faith rewarded; a haunting scene where the KKK is doing a group dance, and the leader is singing a creepy spiritual ... full of surprises, subtle (and otherwise) humor, and some very memorable images.
Not to mention how the movie is infused with bluegrass, blues, etc. which captures the atmosphere wonderfully. Our heroes purported hit, ""Man of Constant Sorrow,"" is quite a catchy number, one that you might want to watch and hear over and over. John Turturro's dancing accompaniment to Clooney's crooning (near the end) is hilarious.
The film was also digitally processed to show the exact colorings wanted by the directors.

I was absolutely stunned, as always, by the tremendous visuals that the Coens threw up there on the big screen, but the lack of a clear, coherent purpose in this movie set me off a little bit.  First of all let's get one thing straight, this movie is not based on the odyssey.  Apart from the siren scene, the fact that Clooney's character is named Ulyssees and that his wife is named Penelope there are no similarities.  The movie does have it's highlights (a muffed KKK ralley for example where the Coens make the sheet toting idiots out to be the total morons that they are) but I think the predominance of bluegrass music really threw me off.  As with every Coen movie, every component--dialogue, cinematography, music--all are utilized to their fullest potential and injected with the maximum amount of meaning.  The bluegrass music is therefore a key component and you can't just tune it out if you hate bluegrass music like I do.  So essentially if you love bluegrass music you might think this is the best movie ever made, if not, you'll still find something to enjoy, but it will be somewhat tainted.",992563200,6,1257,4.584821428571429

I would like to comment about the DVD version of this movie however.  Apparently there was some kind of problem in production as there is a glitch in one scene that causes the movie to freeze as if you've hit the pause button.  I bought one the first day it came out, took it back when I noticed the problem and the replacement copy did the exact same thing at the exact same spot in the movie.
I also noticed some of the color scenes seem to be out of whack.  There are some scenes where the 3 main characters look white as sheets, and the whole scene looks washed out.  I don't recall that being the case when I was watching the movie at the theater.  So I'm assuming something didn't translate well to DVD and it has altered the colors.

Both goofball and sophisticated humor, visually stunning, simplistic on the surface while being complex underneath, it's a delight for the senses and a thinking person's film despite the seemingly dopey subject matter and main characters.
It's a very loose retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in the American deep south during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The three main characters are escaped convicts, and their adventures will keep you entertained throughout the film and wanting more. The acting is right on the money and not overdone (which it could have easily slipped into considering the subject matter). A quote from aint-it-cool-news.com sums it up well, ""George Clooney will never again be this cool in a film.""
I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack, which, if you enjoy the roots of American music like I do, is a great selection of ""mountain music"" and blues songs as well as soundtrack elements done in a slightly more modern style.

This movie just does not tell the story effectively.  If it did, I would have cared when one of the characters was getting whipped.

1326082,2,B00003CXRM,"Whenever I read a review of a movie written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, I invariably see the words ""original"" and ""quirky"" in the description of the film.  But after renting and watching ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"", I am coming to the conclusion that ""original"" and ""quirky"" does not necessarily make a great film.
I wanted to enjoy ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"" and I did think that the cinematography was excellent and the old-time songs were terrific, but this movie is harmed by too many long, drawn out scenes that do little to advance the plot.  I cite as examples the three convicts meeting the three women at the lake/river, the entire governor election subplot and the George ""Babyface"" Nelson sequence.  These scenes contain actors I enjoy watching (Charles Durning and Michael Badalucco from ""The Practice""), but they do little to move the story along and I wondered if they were included just to make sure this movie was a reasonable length for a Coen movie (because without them, the movie would be about an hour long).
I think that the three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) each have their moments, but there just isn't enough meat in the story to make their performances that interesting in general.  I will say that Clooney makes a great slimy character.
The Coen brothers have become established enough that just about anything they do will garner praise from the critics.  In some movies, like ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona"", the praise is well-deserved, but in others, like ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"", it isn't.  I have to put this movie with the latter category.  Better luck next time, Joel and Ethan.",992390400,3,1678,4.825783972125436

1326084,5,B00003CXRM,"Just how it is that hollow and boringly common films like Chocolat and Erin Brockovich got nods for Best Picture over this terrific little film is beyond me.  What a memorable and gorgeous motion picture this is!
The stars of 'O Brother' aren't George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson.  Nor are they even Joel and Ethan Coen, the masterminds behind the project.  Indeed, the real stars of this film are the music and the cinematography with a supporting effort by the script.  All three are so masterfully crafted that they actually accomplish overtaking outstanding performances by the entire cast and become the stars of the film.
Roger Deakins, the genius behind such other aesthetically beautiful films as 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Kundun', 'The Secret Garden', and several other Coen brothers films, really brings the Depression-era South to life with very dusty earthtones and deep, sun-drenched oranges and yellows.  Deakins' visuals in 'O Brother' are so textured and real that I swear I felt myself sweating along with the chain-gang workers as they sang their worksongs.
The legendary T-Bone Burnett oversaw the marvelous music in the film.  By mixing some actual country-blues hits from the era (such as ""You Are My Sunshine"", ""A Man of Constant Sorrow"", and ""Big Rock Candy Mountain""), Burnett provides the Coens' and Deakins a firm and beliveable canvas on which to paint.  As astounding as the visual aspects of 'O Brother' are, the grandeur of the film really rests more on the aural landscaping.  The filmmakers obviously spent a lot of time and money on the music and this effort pays off in big, big ways.
The writing is classic Coen.  They (purposely) exaggerate the local dialect (much like they did in Fargo, Raising Arizona, and others) and don't have to rely on cheap sight gags or crude jokes to get laughs.  'O Brother's' laughs aren't bellylaughs, mind you.  Instead, they accomplish subtle humor through the sheer determination - not to mention incompetence, innocence, improbable success, and all-around lovebility - of the Clooney character and his numbskull accomplices.
Of course, the story is loosely based on Homer's ""The Odyssey"" and the Coens are properly respectful of the epic.  Anybody familiar with that poem will immediately recognize many of the characters and incidents.  And the plotline requires some significant payment of attention - much like Homer's work does.  However, the Coens raise the stakes of fun and spice up the story by using real-life (or near real-life) characters from the Depression:  Babyface Nelson, Robert (aka Tommy) Johnson, Pappy O'Daniel, etal.
This film probably isn't so much for the weekend-night-out types as it is for fans of classic literature, early 20th century American history and music buffs, and students or admirers of art-house cinema (though it certainly was something of a mainstream hit).  I think this explains why there seems to be so much dissension in the reviews here.  Viewers seemingly either loved 'O Brother' or hated it.
Frankly, I think the music and cinematography alone are enough to deserve a look-see.  Even if they don't know ""The Odyssey"" or care very much for the typical art-house film, I think most moviegoers will find something about this gem to love.  I imagine the respect and value of 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will go markedly up over time.  It's just too special a film to have garnered the relatively small amount of attention and love it has.",992217600,5,3476,5.064912280701755

1326087,5,B00003CXRM,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" directed by Joel Coen, is a quirky delight. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, is allegedly a loose adaptation of Homer's Odyssey; I think of the script as more of an original story with certain elements inspired by the Odyssey. But however you look at the film, it is a unique and well-made piece of cinematic art.
George Clooney plays Ulysses Everett McGill, an escaped prisoner who embarks upon an episodic journey with two fellow escapees in the Depression-era Southern United States. Along the way they encounter a one-eyed Bible salesman, ""good-ole-boy"" politicians, and Ku Klux Klansmen, among other characters. Clooney is hilarious as McGill, and the rest of the cast is also excellent. Tim Blake Nelson is particularly engaging as McGill's Forrest Gump-ish comrade, Delmar.
The film is full of excellent music that evokes the folk traditions of the rural U.S. The costumes, sets, and cinematography are all first-rate, and blend perfectly with the other elements of the film. There are some great comic sequences, many with a satiric bite. Overall, ""O Brother"" is a really different, richly entertaining film.",992044800,15,1152,5.165775401069519

The story is original, but is destroyed by stupid cameos and unfunny one-liners. The film is also very offensive at times. Every character seems to have a look of mental disability on his face. This is not funny, it's downright stupid and has no meaning. All the other Coen bros. films have meanings for their characters to have funny looks or funny faces but O Brother, Where Art Thou? does not explain anything whatsoever. And there's a scene where a cow gets run over by a car whilst the boys are being shot at. This is totally a totally gut-wrenching scene, all the audience - about 12 people where in the theatre - looked away from the screen, no laughs going on. I guess the Coen bros. think they can get away with anything now, after all their success. Tim Blake Nelson is the only really impressive performer. George Clooney can sing really well, but him acting in a Coen bros. film is a bit beyond the pale. So, what's good? Well, the cinematography is lush and the musical scenes raise a nice smile, but overall, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one overrated and utterly disappointing film.",991958400,4,1275,4.476394849785407

As someone who typically finds George Clooney wooden and annoying, I found his performance in O Brother to be absolutely hilarious, and the supporting cast was in perfect harmony throughout the laconic romp through the Great Depression Era South . The music is simply phenomenal- I knew (and still know) next to nothing about traditional country/blue grass/spiritual music, but the cross section of truly fitting music in O Brother has me curious- I bought the album a couple of days after its release.

1326149,5,B00003CXRM,"The Coen brothers have a cult following, but until I saw this movie, I didn't count myself among the masses that love the Coens.  However, with this movie, this brother team has cemented their reputation as serious and skilled filmmakers with a lot to say and a stylish way of saying it.
This movie is a loose retelling of ""The Odyssey"" by Homer, set in the Depression-era Deep South.  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson make an unlikely team of escaped convicts who embark on a journey of the weird and wonderful.  Watch for the appearance of many famous Odyssey allusions, such as the Sirens and the Cyclops (among others).  The Coens' quirky take on this classic tale is delightful and perfectly executed, and the script is beautifully and humorously written.  The sets and filming are artistic and a bit mythical, and the casting choices are just great.  The film is peopled with interesting characters, in classic Coen brothers fashion.  Look for great supporting characters played by John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, and others.
And that's not all!  Interwoven in this film are great depression-era songs and some original songs, with excellent music direction by T-bone Burnett.  Who says Moulin Rouge is the first movie in a long while to take the musical format?  This movie is just as much a musical as Baz Luhrmann's much-hyped movie.
I really believe that this movie reaches heights that previous Coen brothers movies (even Fargo) haven't reached.  In addition, I believe this movie was slighted by the Academy during Oscar time.

It's rare to find a movie that hits a home run visually, musically, with a wonderful story AND superb acting. The movie pulls you into the characters' lives (and what characters they are) and the deeper undertones of life and times in the South add a certain poignancy and depth to a wonderfully unique and engrossing story. And speaking of the acting...I am a fan of George Clooney and thought he was an adequate actor but was blown away by his performance in ""O Brother."" The highest praise I can offer is that I forgot it was ""George Clooney"" in the part -- he took over his role and made it his own, and certainly deserved his Golden Globe.

1326154,5,B00003CXRM,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" does a fine job building up a reservoir of good faith.  From the first shot of Our Heroes emerging from the wheat field, to Clooney's curious predilection for a certain brand of pomade, to the lovably sweet mug of Tim Blake Nelson, you just know that a rocking good time is going to be had by all.  That's what I mean by good faith.  And it's a good thing it works so hard at building it up, because it nearly runs out of it in the end.  Luckily, the closing credits pop up just in time.
Not being expertly familiar with ""The Odyssey"" (my English degree hides its eyes in shame), I only got the most obvious of the movie's Ulyssean references (e.g., Clooney's name; an eyepatched John Goodman as the Cyclops; the Sirens).  Don't think it mattered much, though.  It does help if you look at the story as something mythic rather than something realistic.  Suspend that disbelief, and you shall reap entertainment.
The Coen's pay a lot of attention to making the land being traversed optimal for this particular quest.  The terrain flows from arid squalor to lush greenery, from the isolatedly rural to the hecticly urban, and the cinematography is apropos in each setting.  It's also quite gorgeous.  It's not as cartoonish as, say, ""Raising Arizona"", but the Coen's sure know how to frame a comedic shot and sequence.
George Clooney, as the loquacious leader, is miles away from anything else he's done.  I've heard it time and time again that he is a one-note actor, given to hanging his head in a grating, sheepdoggish manner (I call this the `Doug Ross Tilt'), hoping for your forgiveness but not really sorry.  Well, he does none of that here.  Instead, he bugs out his eyes, messes up his hair, and screams like a little girl.  It's a great comedic performance.  He's ably backed up by Coen regular John Turturro, who appears to be a ragged collection of arms and legs and teeth, and Tim Blake Nelson.  I was surprised to learn that Nelson is also a playwright, screenwriter, and director.  Surprised because his Delmar is ""dumber than a bag of hammers"", but blessed with so much pure folksy wisdom that you just fall in love with him.  There are some moments when he is caught with just the most blissful look on his face.  They say more than any dialogue ever could.  Bless the Coen's heart for letting them do just that.  Also on hand here filling out the minor roles are Coen veterans John Goodman (a big and blustery bible salesman) and Holly Hunter (as Clooney's [ex-]wife), as well as prodigious scenery chewer Charles Durning (as the incumbent governor of Mississippi) and the underrated Stephen Root (as a blind recording engineer).
Helping to flesh out the movie is a soundtrack packed with and abundance of ""good-timey"" country-bluegrass classics.  Tops amongst them are Clooney and the boys joined by a Robert Johnson-like guitar player (they pick him up at the crossroads, natch), recording a song as `the Soggy Bottom Boys'.  Their song is supposed to become a huge hit in the narrative, and it's such a joyous number that I can truly see that happening.  And watching them perform it live (twice!) is such a treat, especially since Blake and Turturro do perform some wonderfully ludicrous dance moves.
There's so much here that's just plain energetic and ridiculous, you're bound to fall in love with it.",991094400,10,3351,4.708404802744425
1326155,5,B00003CXRM,"I find it interesting that this film has polarized the viewing public.  Alternately touted as the 'best film of the year' and the 'worst', I didn't know quite what to expect when I sat down to watch ""O Brother.""  While its themes are thousands of years old (due to its loosely adapted Homerian plot) its placement in the Depression-era South is as intellectually stimulating and entertaining as one could possibly expect.  The music is so good that I won't even bother to comment on it save that everyone should purchase the soundtrack.  But the film itself is what sold me as living up to the accolades that many critics (both professional and amateur) have heaped upon this film.  The characterizations are tremendous, the representation of numerous real-life characters and Southern archetypes (the 'Robert Johnson' bluesman who sells his soul or the 'Kingfish' demagogue) are dead on target, and the individual performances are tremendous.  John Goodman does some of his most compelling work as does George Clooney.  But the people that stole the show for me were John Turturro and Charles Durning; their characters were as rich as the script allowed and made me appreciate both the intent of the script and its tangible outcome.  My best advice is to ignore everyone's opinion and watch it yourself.  If you're like the rest of the reviewers (including mine) you'll either love it or hate it.

We were all pleasantly surprised...although amazed might be a better word.  This movie, which roughly follows the Odysey (John Goodman as the Cyclops, the sirens and a possible Circe reference involving a frog are the only obvious parts) which is interesting.  Much better however is the wonderful camraderie between the various leads, especially George Clooney's fast quipped lines ""I'm they're pater familias""
You never know for sure which way this movie is going it meanders like a walk on a warm summer day and that is a wonderful, wonderful thing.  In the end all of the various strands of story get tied nicely together.

What I can say is that the Coen brothers are really strengthening their reputation as one of the few truly intelligent acts in Hollywood. Loosely adapted from Homer's ""The Odyssey"", this film is truly ""American""; icons such as apple pie, Americana music and Dapper Dan hair care(does or did it actually exist?) permeate this movie and it looks great. One does not really need to see it in terms of the original Odyssey: it's perfectly enjoyable even if you can't really remember Homer's version. George Clooney and the rest of the cast are stunning. The photography is amazing. My personal favourite moment: a midnight Ku Klux Klan gathering that is so well choreographed and so grotesque, you have to say to yourself that The Coen brothers are now a major force in shaping American cinema.

1326234,3,B00003CXRM,"I'm not convinced its a classic. The key to this film is the music, and if you hate the music you hate the film. I went to see this movie at the cinema and i loved it, in fact i went back. The directors have put together a montage of colours and images that will im-print themselves in cinemas' hall of fame. I was excited about the release of the film on dvd and bought it on the day of the release, the extra features are minimal, and think they are a lot funnier and impressive than they actually are and the menu is just annoying.
The film does have its ups, george is suprisingly good, so good in fact that the critics forgot to actually watch him closely enough to see he is playing a very easy part, with pretty much the same lines repeated over and over in a different order, hair, treasure, hair, wife, moeny, hair. And whilst he babbles on about hair nets (which at first is pure genius but soon rather stupid), the story takes it time to meander through a 'musical' type structure which to be fair is predictable and unbelievable. Paradies to 'homer' will be made, and to be fair i think thats fair, after all the coen brothers announce at the the beginning that the story is based on homer!!
Moments to watch out for: The orical figure on the tracks isn't new but sure hits the spot that the rest of the film wanted to focus on! A wonderful musical  rally, on an epic level. And a nice moment at the end with a dog... you'll have to wait and see.

1326288,5,B00003CXRM,"O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? was one of the best films I saw all year.  Ethan and Joel Coen(FARGO,  THE BIG LEBOWSKI,  RAISING ARIZONA) have written a movie using the ancient story line to The Odyssey and turned it into the tale of a man's determination to escape prison and stop his wife from re-marrying.  The sheer brilliance of this movie deserves an applause.  Set in the Depression Era,  this comedy/musical(if you will) begins with Everett,  Pete,  and Delmar escaping off the chain gang.  Everett has told them that he has buried 1.2 million dollars near his home,  and they must get to it before the land is made into a river.  Thus begins this amazing movie with countless allusions to The Odyssey.  The blind prophet from the story becomes the blind railway man who tells the men they will go on a quest.  Then,  the men are seduced by three women singing,  the Sirens of course.  And who can forget the one-eyed man Big Dan Teague showing the ruthlessness of the Cyclops?  All in all,  this movie's great script(nominated for an Oscar) and awesome performances make this movie great fun.  George Clooney is incredible as Everett,  and this is the role which won him the Golden Globe award for Best Actor, beating out such stars as Mel Gibson,  Robert Deniro,  John Cusack,  and Jim Carrey.  John Turturro is a chameleon,  a brilliant character actor and great in this movie as Pete.  One of the best played roles is that of Delmar,  played by Tim Blake Nelson.  He is a perfect comic relief character and I feel the most likeable of the three.  In the supporting areas,  John Goodman rocks as Big Dan Teague,  and he can now be called somewhat of a Coen Brothers regular,  having been in THE BIG LEBOWSKI and RAISING ARIZONA.  Holly Hunter,  also a Raising Arizona alum plays a perfect and motherly Penny,  Everett's wife.  Charles Durning is a fiery and strong as Guv'nor Pappy O'Daniel,  as are Chris Thomas King and The Practice's Michael Badalucco.  Wayne Duvall is very good as the rival Homer Stokes.  The really wonderful part of this movie is the music.  In a way,  this comedy is somewhat like a musical,  the music carrying the men from one place to another,  and I especially love the scenes in which the three men and their accomp..uhh,  accompanist(It's a joke from the movie,  see it,  and you'll get it) Tommy roll into ""Man of Constant Sorrow.""  An awesome Coen Brothers Flick!",989020800,8,2402,4.62291169451074

Sure it was a great portraite of the American south during the depression, but the cleverness of weaving such an intelectuals story into an accurate historcal comedy/drama is astounding.  This was a plot of pure wit, and each scene had its equil in the epic peom.  See or buy this movie if you are one who enjoys the pleasures of the intelectual pursuit.

I've seen O Brother four times already, and I can't wait for the DVD.  I was recently introduced to Cohen films by a good friend who knows just about everything about film.  He slips the Cohens into our movie nights--- I haven't been disappointed yet.  The Cohens have crafted a film that is both entertaining and cognitive- I laugh until I cry yet I am made to think- two things you don't often get in the same movie.  To say that this film is boring translates into the ideas that there is nothing intruiging about human nature, that life deserves no more than a sigh, and that there is nothing funny about existence and the paths that we take.  Human nature is and always will be something to be pondered and something to be smiled at.  The Cohens have given us another chance to do that.  It's dangerous ground to mess with a classic, but they have pulled it off beautifully with a tale that I think even Homer himself would approve of.",988588800,3,1063,4.3604060913705585

They escape through the deep south, hooking up with a blues guitar player who has sold his soul to the devil for the ability to play the guitar.

1326292,5,B00003CXRM,"The Coen brothers serve up a beautifully filmed and nearly perfectly executed movie with many scenes and songs that linger in ones head.  It shows both the dark and light of the South in the depression, and reminds us of the power of the music that tried to help everyone get through the rough times.  The warmer sounds of songs like ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and ""I'll Fly Away"" are yearnings for that better place far away.  The premier song, ""Man of constant sorrow"", is a great blues\bluegrass piece, with both performances by Clooney and Cohorts being enjoyably funny.  But perhaps the most impressive song and visual in this film is the baptism scene, when our heroes are suddenly surrounded by white clad Christians floating through the beautiful Southern woods like fireflies all singing a building gospel hymn ""Down to the river"" - a very mesmerizing moment.
The performances are great.  Clooney has an energetic wild eyed zeal and pulls of some great rapid dialog as Ulysses.  Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro do well as the slow witted traveling companions.  Daniel von Bargen (probably known best currently for his role as the Commandant at the military school on ""Malcom in the Middle"") fits the old image of the sherrif perfectly with his cool mannerisms, black outfit, sunglasses (the only person wearing them) and black hat.
While generally funny, the film also has reminders of the effects of the depression on already poor farmers.  It also doesn't forget racial issues in the form of the KKK and how many of its members could make themselves out to be ""normal decent folk"" during the day when they weren't hiding in bedsheets carrying silly names.  Some people take offense at the KKK scene in the movie, but I thought it pointed out the silliness of these people dressing in these costumes and thinking they were superior while also showing that enough stupidity gathered together can do some pretty terrible things.  It can be an uncomfortable scene, but it does contribute to the story (and shows, through our heroes, that not *every* white person in the south was a bigot).
Ultimately, this movie was an enjoyable experience for me.  I could even call it uplifting, as it's beautiful photography and soundtrack have caused me to start liking the South again and appeciate more of the Gospel and Bluegrass from the time.  I love listening to ""I'll Fly Away"" from the soundtrack and picturing soaring up over the dusty roads and fields through gold tinted lenses.",987811200,54,2486,4.8649289099526065

1326375,4,B00003CXRM,"This movie is all American, great music and heartfelt acting. The critics, and the reviews below, all mention that the film is loosely based on Homer's, ""Odyssey"". A tag line begins the film mentioning the same. In an interview, the Cohen brothers stated they have not read Homer's poem. This makes a lot of sense when one remembers that the tag line for ""Fargo"" states the film is based on a true story; the Cohen brothers later said it is a fictional story.
With that said, I have to say that I believe ""Oh Brother..."" is loosely based on the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz.""
Think back on these scenes and characters:
The bounty hunter is really the wicked witch. When they rescue their friend from the KKK reminds me of the scene when the Tin Man, Scarecrow and Lion rescue Dorothy from the witch's castle. All scenes on the road in ""Oh Brother..."" are tinted a yellowish color; hence follow the yellow brick road. The three characters led by Clooney are not seeking a treasure, but the Wizard to give them a pardon and that Wizard is the Governor. The flood near the end of the film is an analogy to the Tornado. Floating by are old tires, a dog and other items.
Next time you watch ""Oh Brother..."" think along these lines and you'll probably find more references to the ""Wizard of Oz.""",984960000,19,1285,4.472340425531915
1326376,5,B00003CXRM,"Producers/writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen evoke the essence of such classic films as ""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,"" with their Depression Era comedy, ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" directed by Joel Coen and starring George Clooney.  Borrowing the title of the ""meaningful"" film that successful comedy filmmaker Sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 Preston Sturges film ""Sullivan's Travels,"" and finally-- in reality-- making it, is only the beginning of this clever, funny tale based on Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  The hero here is one Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), who along with two others, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escapes from a chain gang, commencing an ""odyssey"" for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads, back roads and tank-water towns scattered throughout the good State of Mississippi.  It becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant, and-- for the audience-- always fun.  It's a richly woven tapestry of Americana (including plenty of traditional music) that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer.  Leading man Clooney has one of his best character roles yet-- it's a Clooney we've never quite seen before-- and he is more than up to the task.  Invested with the mustache and rugged good looks of Clark Gable, and with his natural charisma working overtime, he creates a likable, articulate character that stands out in marked contrast to just about every other character in the film.  And he's a joy to watch; his Ulysses is a real kick from start to finish, and it's a performance that is worthy of an Oscar.  Turturro, as well, creates one of his most memorable screen characters, drawing heavily upon the naturally quirky side of his own personality and accentuating his own unique physical traits which lend themselves so well to the embodiment of Pete.  And Nelson does the same with his Delmar; like Turturro, he successfully captures the soul of the character, both physically and emotionally, and-- it must be mentioned-- both actors (with Coen's help, of course) manage to avoid the trap of making their characters mere stereotypes, and it's one of the reasons they are so engaging:  These guys are the genuine article.  The extraordinary supporting cast, all of whom individually create truly original characters in their own right, includes Holly Hunter (Penny), John Goodman (Big Dan), Chris Thomas King (Tommy), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Del Pentecost (Junior O'Daniel) and Michael Badalucco in a memorable turn as George ""Babyface"" Nelson.  Not content to sit on their laurels, the Coen Brothers constantly seek to expand the boundaries of their personal cinematic universe, and they succeed splendidly with ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""  It's a rousingly warm and witty and-- most importantly-- highly entertaining and creative film that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey.  The Coen's distinct imprint, like the cinematic equivalent of The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, is stamped on every frame of the film, and it's like an assurance of quality and a good time to be had by all.  There's magic in the movies the Coen Brothers make, and this one goes far toward proving what anyone who has followed their movies over the years knows already:  Nobody does it quite like Joel and Ethan.

The Coen brothers (never known for subtlety) overdo the film's Southern Gothic elements, diminishing its effectiveness.  By trying to make almost everyone in Mississippi look like sideshow freaks, the film provides no foils for its strange protagonists.  The film explicitly acknowledged its debt to the Odyssey, but the various allusions to the epic poem serve no other purpose than to let the viewer smugly congratulate himself for recognizing them.

The cast,especially George Clooney,uses the funny and in depth dialogue to bring us much needed humor in this year of non-funny movies(with the exception of What Women Want).The onlything better than the movie is the soundtrack. The Coen Brothers use very special music in their movies(like the Spanish version of Hotel of California in The Big Lebowski),once again,they succeed in this task.

1326379,4,B00003CXRM,"Three cons, hot on the trail of the buried loot of an armoured-car heist, are already on the lam in the depression-era South when ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" begins.  Normally a twisted, unregenerate land rife with rednecks, lynchings and good-ole-boy politicking (in countless made-for-TV-movies and episodes of Qunatum Leap), in ""O' Brother"", the South is transformed into a mystical land, teeming with mischievous river nymphs, the occasional treacherous Cyclops (in this case, John Goodman), failing kings (Charles Durning) and their would-be usurpers, and an army of the dead toiling, much as Sissyphus, at rocks.  Much of the journey is episodic, with the three escapees cutting a record (which becomes a hit), crossing ways with a Blues musician who admits to having sold out to satan, hitching a ride with the manic-depressive bank robber George (""don't call him 'babyface'""), and crashing a KKK cookout.  It's no surprise that directors Joel and Ethan Coen were clearly seized by the magic of the Oddysee, and the trials faced by Everett McGill (George Clooney) would have taxed the mighty and wise Ulysses no less.  With its wacked out Coen-style filamtography, and suffused with pre-Nashville (pre-pre-pre-Shania) era music, the film rises above some uninspired modern translation of Homeric poetry.
Admittedly, it would be hard to have these charachters developed by these run-ins while preserving their general cluelessness.  One attempt to do so at the climax seems facile.  With edgy John Turturro palying off the cool Clooney (expertly and subtley prepped to look like Gable), the script never questions its insanities.  Like the best Coen pictures, the characters accept every last bit without so much as a wink.",980380800,6,1729,5.311355311355311

When my daughter had to read The Odyssey for school, we decided to follow it up by watching this movie and identifying all the parallels.  That made for a fun evening.

If you've not read Homer's Odyssey, I'll suggest digging into it and then watching O Brother ... it's a good movie by itself, and even a better one when you can track the story line with Homer's tome.",1524528000,2,803,4.148387096774194
