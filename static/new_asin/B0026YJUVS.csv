If I'm anxious at night, I put this on in my bedroom, and it calms me down. It's great, because my window sits on a main city street - not very pleasant, but now it's like I have a clear shot of the moon every night. I also put it on at my Memorial Day party and everyone loved it. It was perfect to have this playing in the background instead of some random TV channel!",1243382400,,525,3.9158878504672896
8353769,4,B0026YJUVS,"I bought this dvd because it looked interesting. There are several different views of the moon in two colors; one silvery-blue and my favorite, the yellow. The yellow moon rising is impressive to watch. There is also a distant view of the moon as well.  I found it very relaxing.  I can set it to loop so I don't have to change the dvd (this feature will come in handy for parties). The moon looks really good on the flat panel tv. I really like the option to turn the music on or off;  although the music on the dvd is very good. The moon facts were great.",1242086400,,557,4.138888888888889

Its like we have a telescope hooked up to our TV. It comes with music, but we usually use our own.",1242000000,,265,3.925925925925926
