8407847,5,B003X82CUW,Daddy Day Camp I know I heard a lot of my friends say how horrible it was because it's all new actors and what not BUT I love it because I don't even think of it as a sequel I think of it as a whole different movie and it's fun to watch. :) Are We Done Yet I think watching the first one Are We There Yet is better to get a better understanding because it is a sequel and honestly? My husband watched both with me and he liked Are We Done Yet much better. He thought it was more entertaining and funnier.,1415491200,,504,3.8095238095238093
