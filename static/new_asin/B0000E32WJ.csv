1931712,3,B0000E32WJ,"This upsets me that we waited and waited for the release of lion king 1 1/2 to learn that it is only a DVD release.  We had planned on throwing a huge theater party with our scout troop, now we will have to find another cartoon in theaters to watch.  No one wants to stay home and watch a movie if there is an option to watch one in the theater.  A bad movie in the theater is still more fun than a good movie at home--it's the theater experience. I am sure kids will like the DVD, however, they would rather go to the theater and see something else, than sit at school or home and watch one.  (I have no opinion of the star rating, I was required to enter something to send this form.)",1074556800,2,686,3.9854014598540144
1931713,4,B0000E32WJ,"Clever teaser trailer promises a smart and funny movie.  The animation in the recent expanded trailer seems to try it's best to match the original, at least as much as it's limited budget probably allows.
I also love the ingenious title.  Unfortunatly changed in my native Britain to 'The Lion King 3 - Hakuna Matata' - ain't that a hoof in the head! Anything with Nathan Lane involved has gotta have some merit though.",1073952000,,419,4.648648648648648

1932402,5,B0000E32WJ,"The joke behind this film (using a format `borrowed' from Mystery Science Theater 3000), is that we really didn't see all of the story in the first film.  We didn't see Timon and Pumbaa's part in it.  And as though the first film was a home movie, now we get to see the missing bits.

This revisionist's version of The Lion King is hilarious.  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I liked it more than the other two films.  I can at least safely state that I found it much more enjoyable than those two films.  In this movie we get a glimpse of Timon's early life with a mother who sounds suspiciously like Marge Simpson (Julie Kavner does the voice for both).  He's not adept at digging tunnels or standing guard.  So he leaves home and finds Pumbaa and a place like paradise where they raise a lion cub named Simba.  The rest is history.

A great alternative to the somber films that begat it.",1420070400,,891,4.313253012048193

1932478,1,B0000E32WJ,"I was highly disappointed with this movie.  The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, is the rightful sequel in my opinion.

I felt like this was a parody, making fun of the first movie.  Some parts were cute, like Timon and Pumba raising baby Simba, but for the most part, it lacked a creative plot and seemed very cheesy and immature, as if it were for kindergarteners.  I'm sure little kids like it, but I certainly don't.  The format was annoying; them in a movie theater.  It's basically a crappy version of the first Lion King movie.  I regret spending $30 on this.  I should have rented it from the public library instead.  They practically made fun of ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"", and when Timon asked Shenzi to marry him, I was shaking my head and was ready to turn the movie off.  We all know this was made as an attempt for Disney to make more money (as all sequels are), but they could have done a lot better than this.  I would have rather seen a Lion King 3 about Kiara and Kovu's child.  This was just pointless.  I won't watch it again.",1407110400,3,1047,4.280612244897959

Even as a 37-year old, some of the Pumba-Timon dialogue regarding flatulence was really quite clever, what can I say!! :)  Well, it struck my funny bone, at least.

However this film is meant to just be laugh out loud funny, and that it was. I literally find myself ROLLING whenever I watch it. So, it's set around the same time as the beginning of Lion King, but you are following Timon and Pumbaa's story instead. It's just ridiculous. Timon you realize is just a man looking for something more in his life. And he meets his Warthog compadre and they go through so much together. There's a lot of gags in this that explain more of what happened in the first movie. Little subtle things you would have never known had happened. Like... did you know Timon and Pumbaa actually tripped Simba and Nala down the hill during their love scene? But they did! Along the way the two are in the background like they are watching a home movie, and even pause it at one point which is another gag that cracks me up to no end.

1932777,5,B0000E32WJ,"Yes, yes, you may rightly ask, ""How dare they make a follow-up to such a classic animated film as `The Lion King'?"" And, the truth is, there is much to be gained - or to loose, for that matter -- by doing a sequel. But ""The Lion King 1 "" works - it was quite a pleasant surprise! It is great fun for all family, and I'm sure you will laugh as much as I did!

It all starts at Timon's homeland, where life for meerkats was boring and dangerous. You either keep digging tunnels to protect your colony against hyenas, or you would have to be on the constant watch - a vigilante -- for hyena attacks. Timon tried both and he failed to the point that his colony did not trust him. Because of this, he realized that he would be better trying his luck out of the prairie, and find a place in which he could have a purpose and happiness. While doing so, he meets Pumbaa, the good-hearted warthog, who will accompany him in his quest to find his Shangri-la, in this case, a mountain that he could see from afar, which he named the ""big pointy rock."" On the way, too, they meet Simba, who they adopt and raise as a brother, and whom they would help to claim his kingdom when he grows up. In-between, we enjoy some hilarious moments, which include some very smart fart jokes and a snail-eating contest. The Jacuzzi scene is a classic, and you will surely incorporate the ""after a good day of doing nothing, it's good to kick back"" in your lifestyle.

The ""The Lion King 1 "" is a direct-to-video feature, so don't even try to compare it to the original one. This one is not as majestic as its predecessor, and it is very clear from the very start that this film is meant to entertain and make us have a great time. In a way, I would venture to say that the folks at Disney glued some leftovers from the ""Lion King,"" which let us understand the characters better. In addition, there is music, of course, and some awesome animation and colors. The ending is smart, too - pure Disney magic. The Blu-ray + DVD edition includes deleted scenes, ""Timon: Behind the Legend,"" a making-of documentary, and more. It is important to mention that, in addition to ""The Lion King 1 ,"" Disney also released ""The Lion King 2,"" which it is not subject of this review. Released March 6, 2102.(USA, 2004, color, 76 min plus additional materials).

1932778,1,B0000E32WJ,"I have heard that I would love this film because it's all about Timon and Pumba doing what they do best. However the film chooses the worst moments to be funny.
The movie is basically the two comic characters re-telling the first movie from their perspective and not only does this fail to be funny but takes any power or meaning out of the first film. You know that awesome moment were Scar reveals his plans to kill his brother and take over the kingdom? Well why not shove Timon and Pumba in the far corner have them do a river dance gag. Or the scene where Simba is about to lose his father to said plot? Let's have the two make poop jokes.

1932813,5,B0000E32WJ,"This movie is funny, fun, and entertaining from start to finish.  I found it very clever too.  It totally gave new dimension to the original Lion King by providing a lot of background - essentially behind-the-scenes content that allow for a deeper understanding as to what was happening at various moments of the original.

Another interesting note about this film is that it is stress free.  What I mean, is that many stories seem to have a difficult situation to deal with usually provided by an evil or misguided character - think of most other Disney films for instance.  This movie just rolls along with easy humor and nothing perceivable as frightening or stressing.  I found this rather refreshing because I am a bit tired of so many movies having a ""bad guy"" involved in the story line.  Thus, there are no scary parts in this film, which for younger audiences is a plus.

Also, like a lot of other animated films (e.g., Shrek & Hoodwinked films); there are many jokes that older viewers will appreciate.",1330473600,,1012,4.7102272727272725

1932833,5,B0000E32WJ,"Our whole family actually really enjoyed this film.  It should be noted that where the focus of Lion King 1 & 2 was primarily drama with comic relief, this film does not take itself seriously and is pure comedy.  So, if comparing it to the other two films, you will likely come away disappointed.  However, taken for what it is, pure and unadulterated nonsense, it is quite enjoyable.  (I mean, come on, it's hosted by Timon and Pumbaa!  What'd you expect?)  :-)

If you were one who felt that the subject matter or drama of the original Lion King (or it's sequel) were a bit too intense for your young child, you'll be pleasantly surprised at this light-hearted fare featuring the Lion King ensemble.  It's a great way to introduce children to the cast of characters they've become familiar with through theme parks, Disney marketing and television, in a harmless way.

If you're a big fan of the Lion King, you'll likely also enjoy this energetic and cheeky romp, with characters you've grown to love, containing references and in-jokes from the original film.

1932868,3,B0000E32WJ,"As a kid who was raised in the pop culture of the 90's, I was one of those kids who couldn't get enough of The Lion King. I used to watch it several times each month when it was released on VHS. I could memorize almost every single line of dialogue from the movie, as well as memorize the music to all five songs. Now, even to this day, The Lion King is one of my all-time favorite animated films (alongside Fantasia, The Secret of NIMH, and American Pop). It's one of the greatest Disney films ever created. Then comes The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride. It's not an excellent sequel, but it's not bad either. Like The Rescuers Down Under, it's certainly better than most Disney sequels that have been released solely on DVD. Then comes The Lion King 1 1/2, and this is when the franchise has begun to crumble.

This sequel is basically a re-telling of the original story, but the points of view are now from Timon and Pumbaa. First off, I will say that it's nice to see the characters once again. Even if there are a few new voice actors, it's still a pleasure to see Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, the hyenas, and many others again. The animation still looks good, and there are still plenty of laughs. The problem, however, is that this sequel relies more on comedy than drama. The first two TLK films had lots of dramatic power in the storyline and in the development of the characters. Lion King 1 1/2 is now centered on the comedic relationship between Timon and Pumbaa, and how they see the fall and rise of Simba (in their perspectives). The movie relies too much on the meerkat and the warthog. Don't get me wrong, I still like the two sidekicks. But they turn the original story from the first film into an awkwardly comedic mess. True, some of the tension is still present at the climax, but that's basically about it. Plus, Ma and Uncle Max were completely useless. I don't even know why they were in the film in the first place.

This sequel ruins the serious tone that the first two Lion King films were known for. I don't think Timon and Pumbaa are the true stars of the TLK universe: the lions are the ones that should be the main focus. 1 1/2 isn't one of the worst sequels (there are still some good things about it), but it still pales in comparison of the great original. If there ever IS going to be a Lion King 3, then I hope it doesn't rely on just humor and light-heartiness like this one.

Even has a sing a long for your little one!,1253232000,,335,3.869565217391304
1932945,1,B0000E32WJ,"When ""The Lion King"" premiered, many of the best minds and greatest talent of Disney were working on ""Pocahontas."" Few people expected the original Lion King to be nearly as great a success as it was. The original ""Lion King"" with music by Elton John was a surprising success and deserved to be successful. However, (sadly) this remake of the story from the perspective of Timone and Pumba does not even begin to compare with the original production.

My reasons:

1. The original film was logical. The settings were consistent. In this film, the settings are not consistent. Numerous examples exist where the animation fails to capture reality. For example, when the animals bow to Simba right after his birth, Pumba creates a toxic smell from the outer extremity of the animal population. A subsequent shot places Pumba and Timone along with the animals that were knocked out by the toxic smell much closer to Pride Rock. Nearly directly after this, Timone and Pumba witness the ""Oh, I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" song. However, it reality, a long period of time must have passed between Simba being lifted into the air for all animals to see, and Simba's singing of the ""Oh, I Just Can't Waint to Be King"" song. Thirdly, Pumba and Timone are carried off by the stampede, yet land in a river, go over a waterfall, and reach their new home. In essense, their new home was close to Pride Rock. Yet, they must cross a desert to return to Pride Rock. Fourthly, the snail eating contest between Simba and Timone was impossible. There is no way Timone could have eaten anywhere near the number of snails the film alleges. Further examples then those previously named can be found.

2. The music in this film is very poor- not at all motivating or inspiring.  Where the first Lion King had ""Circle of Life"" ""Be Prepared"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight,"" this film had ""Dig a Tunnel"" and ""Looking After Number 1."" Both these new songs were quite cheesy and frankly bad music. In other words, do not expect any Elton John-quality music in this film.

3. I did not really find the moral or theme in this film. In fact, the film reminded me of a cartoon that children watch on Saturday morning. In other words, I do not think the film was marketed for anyone over the age of eight years old.

4. Timone and Pumba's theatrical interruptions were quite annoying. They were more like commercial breaks in an already boring production.

Final Thoughts:

For young children who enjoy hearing and watching their favorite Lion King characters, I am certain this film will entertain them. There is certainly plenty of illogical nonsense. However, for adults or people who hope this film resembles the original Lion King, I believe you will be quite disappointed.

Now, I watched this film on ""Watch Movies Online"" because I wanted to see what it was like. For people interested in watching this film, I would advice watching it online and saving your money.",1246838400,9,2944,4.689922480620155

1932948,5,B0000E32WJ,"Sitting down in a private theater to watch the original ""The Lion King"", Timon the wisecracking meerkat and Pumbaa the gassy warthog are our Mystery Science Theater 3000 silhouette-style hosts for ""Lion King 1 1/2"", a Disney direct-to-video sequel done so well it makes everyone who says all Disney direct-to-DVD is garbage look completely ignorant of what they're talking about. The film beautifully tells the story within the story. It's all about Timon and Pumbaa this time around, especially Timon, as we learn how he became an outcast and went on a search for his own Hakuna Matata, a place where he truly belongs. Of course, along the way he meets Pumbaa, and eventually they take in little Simba and experience the joys of parenthood together. We follow Timon and Pumbaa's personal adventure through the course of the Lion King film, right to the end, and it is a truly fun and funny ride! And don't worry, the fully animated silhouettes of Timon and Pumbaa are not present most of the time.

As a direct-to-DVD release from Disney, The Lion King 1 1/2 is of that rare breed on par with theater quality productions (it's not the only one, despite what you might hear, but there aren't a lot). It completely resembles the original film in its visuals, and though most of the songs aren't that memorable (a couple are, including Timon and Pumbaa's take of ""Sunrise, Sunset"" from ""Fiddler on the Roof""), they are enjoyable and the film is well scored. Most of the roles in the film are reprised by the original cast members, and new characters (mainly Timon's mother and uncle, voiced by Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller) are introduced as well. Comedy is the order of the day here, but some T&P fans might get ruffled by the fact that their new origin story contradicts those of the Timon and Pubaa TV series. Still, the situation here is more tolerable than it was with ""Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"". The T&P TV show presented a much cartoonier take on the characters in general, and many aspects of that show wouldn't fit in well with the film series, so one almost has to view it as a separate canon. So, you know, get over it like I had to with Little Mermaid. Be content that this film is very well made and extremely fun and entertaining, though definitely only for Timon and Pumbaa fans and Lion King completists. We get a fun look at Simba growing up with the guys, but more than anything this is about the pig and the meerkat!

The DVD is a funny thing. It's well done and all, but it doesn't really seem to require a 2-disc set. I mean, some of the extras are pretty neat, but there really isn't much on that second disc. In addition to the gorgeous, enhanced widescreen presentation of the film, disc one holds a pretty silly ""find the hidden Mickeys"" game called ""Hidden Mickey Hunt"" that places Mickey Mouse shapes throughout the film as you watch it, plus there is a nice batch of pretty cool storyboarded deleted scenes. There's also the unnecessary preview of Disc 2. Disc 2 has two scanty sections: Featurettes and Games & Activities. Featurettes has an extra that was almost great! It is a short spoof of A&E's Biography, actually hosted by Peter Graves and with new (if not very good) animation of Timon and co. for the interviews, but it unfortunately plays out as if a good portion of it was cut from the middle, ending rather abruptly with Peter Graves walking off the set in a fit. The ending was okay but premature, so the overall humor didn't really play out right. Too bad. A nice attempt. Disc 2's Featurette section also has a cute making-of that doesn't get too detailed but at least shows some interviews with the voice cast and Australian house animators. Lastly for the Featurettes section is the obligatory Disney Channel star music video, this one being Raven's take on Grazing in the Grass. If you like the song, it's not bad to listen to but not much to watch. These Disney Channel videos are hit or miss with me. They're totally unnecessary, shameless DC promotion, and sometimes awful, but I enjoy them when they have girls I find cute, ha. Never was too into Raven though. As for the Games and Activities section, here we find ""Timon and Pumbaa's Virtual Safari 1.5"", a new take on the safari experience from the Lion King Platinum Edition DVD. This time around, the boys have constructed a spoof of Disney theme park rides, and this one actually spoofs specific rides in it. The Pirates of the Caribbean bit is hilarious! I just wish this safari experience had been longer! The Haunted Mansion spoof could have gone a bit further and more Disney ride spoofs would have been awesome! Nice bonus though! ""Who Wants to be King of the Jungle"" is another bonus feature, and it's a rather fun take on trivia games that puts Timon in the hot seat of the popular ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" game show, only set in the jungle and playing for grubs and royalty this time around. It's actually hosted by the actual host, Meredith Vieira, and the questions are all about the Lion King trilogy. New Timon animation is featured as he reacts to questions and comments, and it's actually really enjoyable to play multiple times! The final bonus is the ""Find the Face"" silhouette matching game, as we are asked to identify some of the Disney characters that join Timon and Pumbaa in their theater at the end of the film. This is a pretty easy game and I find myself wondering if it's the same each time, but I didn't give it a second go. I am not into most DVD games, though I have to give them credit on the Games and Activities section for this DVD, as the virtual safari and game show spoof were a real surprise treat.

So, the final word on the ""Lion King 1 1/2"" DVD is that I highly recommend it, though it probably could have been kept to one disc considering the amount of extras, some great, some almost great, some just okay. The film is awesome, and that's the important thing. And if you'd like to know more Disney direct-to-DVD titles that are actually worth checking out, here are a few of my own top recommendations: Bambi 2, An Extremely Goofy Movie, Lilo and Stitch 2, The Tinker Bell Movie, Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy: The Three Musketeers, Tarzan 2, 101 Dalmatians 2, and Cinderella 3: A Twist In Time (if you can get past the cutesy opening and not take the film too seriously as canon). The others have good and bad points mostly, though often the bad outweighs the good, but not all the time (Lion King 2 isn't as feature quality as 1 1/2, but it's still one of the better Disney direct-to-video releases, for example). Plus, I have heard good things about Brother Bear 2, but I haven't watched my copy yet, and I still need to get/see a few others, like Mulan 2 and Leroy and Stitch.

Oh yeah, final note on ""Lion King 1 1/2"", yes, like the other Lion King titles, it is supposed to have a snazzy book style slip-cover, just for your information. My copy from Amazon came without it, and yeah, that annoys the heck out of me, because my other two titles in the series have theirs. So if you decide to seek out this now out of print title, you may want to keep the slipcover issue in mind too. Some folks don't care about them. I don't care if a DVD release comes with a slipcover, but if it does, then I want my copy to have it, especially when it's the fancy kind that opens up. But this isn't the only one I'm missing.",1237852800,,7442,4.514455151964418

Sure, it was a little disturbing to see Timon and Pumbaa kiss, but there's two reasons why it was justified.  The first being that they did it by accident.  The second that by the disgusted looks on their faces, they obviously didn't enjoy it.  Timon proposing to Shenzi was a bit disturbing too, but he needed to distract the hyenas and if it's stupid, but it works, it ain't stupid.

I love the first Lion King movie and the second one, and I also love lions, as I have said before. BUT THIS...IS JUST A REALLY DISRESPECTFUL AND ROTTEN INSULT TO THEM! DO NOT SEE THIS PILE OF JUNK! IT IS WORSE THAN THE CATWOMAN MOVIE! I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN CATWOMAN, AND I KNOW  ALREADY THAT IT SUCKS EVEN MORE! THIS IS AN OFFENSE TO THE LION KING, YOU HEAR ME! AND IT'S AN OFFENSE TO ALL GOOD PEOPLE AND OF COURSE COOL ANIMALS!

1933017,2,B0000E32WJ,"I had a chance to watch ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" yesterday, and I was impressed at the degree to which a studio can copy from itself, without any shame. I would have to say probably half the movie was copied from the original, or built around it in a way that is probably reflected well in the title. I give it 2 stars and not one, because in the 50% or so that is original, there are a handful of funny lines by Timba.

It's not really a sequel or a prequel, nor does it add too much to the whole story. Bottom line, it goes into why Timon and Pumba were on their own prior to meeting Simba, and then it goes into a little more into their life together as a trio of buddies without any worries in life. All in all, it seems like another way Disney deviced to further milk a great franchise. Don't buy it.",1122854400,4,802,3.981366459627329

I mean you have to think of some of things that happened in this movie that makes it stupid, Timon and Pumbaa just went down a river in the pridelands and they were at the oasis, but Simba wondered around in a desert for weeks. What the hell happened? Then they all ran back through the desert to the pridelands. What's going on there? The meerkats were only afraid of Hyena's, but Mufasa made sure that they were never in the Pridelands. Among other things wrong with this movie.

Only thing good about the movie was kawaii little Simba.

And the more disturbing thing was Timon and Pumbaa kissed. O.o I'm all for Yaoi moments and I know the dude who did Timon's voice is gay but still it was scary.

Now, I love the first Lion King (it's a classic!) but I do know that some people are quite upset with the fact that the story doesn't revolve around the Lion King and his pride but personally that was no bother. To me, this story gave an insight of what happened turning the time that we missed when we saw Simba growing up. The comedic twist to everything that occured in the first Lion King was terrific (ex. The bowing down of the animals when Simba was born) and rather witty. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1115683200,,799,4.256578947368421

In some respects, there are some great shots at ""revisionist"" cartoon ""history"" where, for example, Pumbaa's  flatulence  explains why an act of genuflection occurred.
Anyway, this is great from the point of view of kids, and those who think like kids. It also brings in the same tone as the Timon and Pumbaa  series( I have seen that only on VHS to date), and bought every copy I could find in the releases.
This film has  a certain wanton grossness that some kids love in Timon and Pumbaa ( how else  do you explain the ""Bug""  cereal that  sells at Publix, Walmart and etc ? :-),also check out the TIMON AND PUMBAA  cartoon series for more flatulence  based humour[ all done in the best possible taste].

Anyways, the retro on Timon's earlier life , pre-Pumbaa , is fun. The Meerkats behave like over-caffeinated squirrels ( at least the ones I see in the big bend area  of Tallahassee, but that might be because they run on power lines and are getting electrocuted :-).
Anyways, it isn't deep and meaningful, it is not about the circle of anything... this movie is just plain fun, and great back view of the more serious drama in the films 1 and 2, from a fun perspective.
Nathan Lane is great as usual, and if you like anything he does as a voice  actor, check out his work in MOUSE HUNT, and you will be laughing for a long while.",1106870400,,1435,4.403041825095057

1933100,3,B0000E32WJ,"Let's face it; Disney does not have a good track record with sequels. Often times the Disney sequels are more to capitalize on a brand name than to advance the story any. This is the case with Lion King 1/2 unfortunately. Wanting to capitalize on the recent DVD release of the Masterpiece The Lion King Disney not only put out the direct to DVD Behind-the-scenes-quill, but also re-released the lackluster ""Simba's pride"". While all three films are enjoyable both 1/2 and Simba's Pride lack the heart and visual quality of the original. It's sadly overly obvious that Disney does not follow the usual Hollywood tactic of putting more money in to the sequels. Nope, it's all about a quick buck. Thankfully I do feel that while this movie wasn't what I had hoped for it is worth the money to pick it up, especially if you have kids, or plan to have kids. What was I hoping for? Well, the slapstick antics were there, but in much smaller quantities than Timone and Pumba's television series which is a far better laughter-fest than 1/2. I did enjoy the Mystery Science Theater like antics of this film as well, but found that the movie didn't really add anything to the lore of the Lion King. We already knew Timone was an outcast Merekat... It's just... well an unnecessary addition to the series. It's fun, but I'd have much rather seen Disney release a box set of the Timone and Pumba TV Series.",1096848000,2,1395,4.584
1933101,3,B0000E32WJ,"Let me start that this movie isn't back. It's ok. It worth renting to watch Timon and Pumba's take on the original story. But nothing on their take is really that interesting enough to make this dvd worth owning. Plus, like another reviewer said most of the questions that they answer are ones you never asked in the first place. For example, the one that answers why the animals bowl at the beginning when Simba is shown. Now the reason nobody ask that question was because the conclusion they came to make perfect sense. They were bowling out of respect for the prince and future king. So therefore this answer not only make total sense but is expected of the animals. So this question didn't need to be answer. Second example when the animals fell down at the end of the ""I Can't Wait to Be King"" song nobody wonder why they fell. Once again the reasonable conclusion is because one of the animals lose their balance and cause the other animals to fall. In this case it wasn't true but it interesting to see that Pumba cause it. But you don't need to that question, because you never ask it. The questions that this film answered that you probulary did ask was where did Timon and Pumba come from? How did they meet?  I happy to say the film show you that thus answering the questions. On a side note here, this film did answer one question that I alway had about the original lion king. In the original, all three Simba, Timon and Pumba were in a desert and suddenly they in a jungle setting. I always whoa where that jungle come and how did they get there? Well in this film it show that jungle was right next to the desert spot where they found simba. Thus one of my questions was answered. However while I'm reviewing the film I might as well point on huge mistake that

make one part of the original film not make sense. In this film, you see that Timon witiness Simba and Nala's fight in which Simba's storms off. But in the original film he later telling Nala when she asking him where Simba is? That he though Simba was  with her. Now in the original film this make perfect sense because according to that film he wasn't present. But now this film show that he was there and did see the fight. So my question is if he saw Simba storming off after their fight, why would he tell Nala later that he thought Simba was with her when he a couple of hour eariler he saw Simba leave Nala after their fight. It make no sense. This destroys one of the parts of the original film.

You know if Disney was going a movie in between 1 and 2. They could this retelling to help explain where Zira come from and also how Kovu was born and why Scar chose him. If you don't know who Zira is she the villian in Lion King 2. This film could have  use to clear how she fit in the story. This could have help clear this issue for Lion King 2. However they didn't so what are you going to do.

My opinion on this film, this film is worth renting to watch Timon and Pumba take on the original story, but there nothing here that make it worth owning. My advice, rent it and see if you like it, but don't buy it because it not worth owning.",1094947200,4,3125,4.217391304347826
1933102,4,B0000E32WJ,"Well at least there were lots of funny noises at meal time here too.

This film takes you back before the beginning of The Lion King, and neatly fills in all the gaps that you never realised existed.

Timon is the ""Flik"" (A Bug's Life) of his community, clumsy and discontent with his lot in life, and sets off to find his dream home, where he can fit in.  He meets up with Pumba, and the friendship begins.

The animation is great, the original cast give an excellent performance, the jokes and puns are non-stop, and there are new songs that are very catchy.

There's a funny karaoke sing a-long where you need to keep an eye on the insect that's setting the timing, and somehow excerpts from ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""The Good The Bad and the Ugly"" and other themes fit right in.

Brace yourself for the finale, that involves synchronised swimming, para gliding, and a huge cast of characters.

The only black mark on this movie is it's length, at only 77 minutes, but on the bright side, it's only 77 minutes to watch over and over with your kids.

This is one of Disney's better sequels.  It isn't a ""Toy Story 2"", but a far better movie than many other direct-to-video disasters we've seen.  It's laugh out loud funny, but children may not get all the jokes.

Worth at least 4.5 stars.

1933103,2,B0000E32WJ,"Lion King ruled, no question, Lion King 2 was actually very well done and was great for a sequel, but this 1 1/2 is a cheap money making scheme by Disney. First of all, I found this movie/documentary, or whatever you want to call it, very boring and a waste of my money and it will be a waste of yours too if you considering buying it. Take it from a fan who loves the Lion King story.

For whatever reason, and no offense to Amazon though, I blame Disney and the people that say this is a great movie. They mixed unwarranted comedy with snipits of the original Lion King and meshing those together made me angry and upset that Disney could even call this ""Lion King"". This is not a movie and should not even be considered one.  It mainly focuses on the warthog and the annoying weasel throughout the whole thing. You have to sit through their annoying chatter and hear them discuss the story of the original Lion King in their own words. There are some decent moments with Simba but 75% of the movie is the warthog and the weasel, don't expect anytime with the pride or in the pridelands, which I thought the Lion King was supposed to be about anyway. To it's credit, the animation is decent and the kids will love the comedic take on the movie, but I did not enjoy this farce.

1933154,5,B0000E32WJ,"Be mindful that this review might contain spoilers for this movie.

 I've always treasured the 1994 original ""Lion King"" movie ever since I first saw it on the big screen when it came out and today it is still a much beloved Disney movie and one of the companies last great movies (Not including the Pixar CGI animated movies) to date. This ingenious addition to the legacy of this wonderful classic is one of the most unique animated films to have come out in many years. I find it hard to say if ""The Lion King 1 1/2 ""is either a sequel or a prequel. I would almost consider this as more of like a parallel storyline because it takes place at the exact same timeline as Simba's does.

 This is the story of Simba's life but where as the original was through Simba's perspective, ""1 1/2"" on the other hand is told through the eyes of lifelong buddies Timon the meerkat, and Pumbaa the warthog and delves back into Timon's past as an outcast amongst his meerkat community that dug tunnels and was disillusioned with the concept of meerkats being on the bottom of the food chain. As disaster happens due to his bumbling, he leaves his old life behind and goes out on his own into the world. While on his adventures Timon meets up with a loner warthog named Pumbaa. From there it's the start of a lifelong friendship between the two.

 From there it's a long adventure for the twosome buddies and then came along the young lion cub Simba who escaped from his evil uncle Scar after his father Mufasa is killed. From there it's a really light-hearted adventure where Timon and Pumbaa tell their side of the story of when Simba came along and how they aid him in reclaiming his rightful place as the king of Pride Rock. Also Timon and Pumbaa venture out on their quest for ""Akuna Matata"", the place of their dreams.

 The shenanigans in this movie are so funny. Do you remember when Simba was singing ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" and when the song ended, the whole formation of performing animals falls apart and they all fall on top of each other when the song ends? Well 1  shows you what caused it to happen. There are a lot of other scenes that answer other questions as to how or why things happened in the original that may have had some baffled.

 It's also really funny how the major events that were important in the original were just mere background noise to Timon and Pumbaa especially with Simba being held in the air at the beginning just being a background event.

 The best part is where Timon and Pumbaa like `pause' the movie and comment on several events they went through and how they comment on the various events they went through.

 We meet some new characters on here. One is Timon's doting mother who to my surprise sounds like the voice of Marge Simpson. The other is none other than Uncle Max who is a riot with his hot-tempered personality similar to a drill sergeant on a bad day and having too much coffee. There are lots of new songs that are really great to listen to and for kids to sing along with but are also very enjoyable for older audiences too.

 The animation, while not the most stunning by any means, is really good and blends hand drawn cell art and computer animation and the result creates a lot of really colorful scenes throughout the animated feature.

 The cast involved in the original return for this ingenious alternate version and have lost none of their edge and are just as great on this as they were on the original classic from 1994.

 The second disc is unfortunately lacking. While kids might enjoy it to some degree, adults will find a lot of the features on this second DVD to be rather lacking and nowhere near as enjoyable as the features were on disc two of the ""Special Platinum Edition"" of the original ""Lion King"" movie. There is a poorly done commentary along with a quiz game involving a talk show host whose named eludes me at the moment and it feels more like some kind of video game advertisement than an actual DVD featurette. There is also a Virtual Safari on this but it's nowhere near as great as the one on the original Lion King Special Edition DVD released late in 2003.

The movie itself is also very short even for Disney animated movies being only 72 minutes long. It just leaves you wanting more. For these things I can't help but feel slightly disappointed yet also feel immensely impressed at the same time.

 This isn't one to watch if you haven't seen the original. If you do so, then this will leave you totally confused. For those who are familiar with the original Lion King movie, then this will be a highly entertaining movie that casts a totally different light on the Lion King saga.

 I was a bit skeptical about this when it came out considering that it was a straight-to-DVD movie but to my total surprise, this turned out not only to be much better than I though, but it also turns out to be a wonderfully entertaining animated film for the whole family. It is really an utter delight to actually watching the Lion King sage through a totally different light altogether and also bringing much further insight into Timon and Pumbaa's past and putting them in the front seat. ""The Lion King 1 "" is Highly recommended and succeeds in maintaining the magic and spark of the original. Buy it today but buy it cheap or used.",1093132800,2,5314,4.452577319587629

1933156,4,B0000E32WJ,"Having had a bad experience with made-for-video Disney sequels before (102 Dalmatians, anyone? Yikes!) I was expecting the worst from this, but my son's such a big Lion King fan that I got it for him anyway.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised!

The backstory of Timon and Pumba, while a little convoluted, provides the perfect backdrop and explanation of how their paths ended up intersecting with Simba's in the original film.  As a result, all the ""important"" events in the original film are cleverly winked at as mere background noise to the oblivious adventures of Timon and Pumba.  I was reminded of Tom Stoppard's brilliant comedy, ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstein Are Dead,"" where the 2 least important characters in Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" take center stage and the tale of the Danish Prince is shoved to the background.  In ""The Lion King 1 1/2,"" the presenting of the baby Simba is literally stumbled upon by Timon and Pumba, and they have no idea what's going on and shrug off the big crowds and commotion as a total irritant. It's basically one joke throughout the whole movie, so it's lucky for them that it's a very funny one.

I agree with other reviewers that the ad-libbing by the two lead voice-actors was a bit distracting, and some of the songs weren't entirely necessary, especially the meerkat song, which is catchy anyway.  But the story itself is very smart, and the animation has the nuanced coloration and detail of the original film, not the technicolor overkill of ""Simba's Pride"" and the terrible ""Timon and Pumba"" Saturday morning series.

In addition, the DVD itself is chock full of excellent extras, including a few music videos and an AWESOME ""Virtual Safari"" that entertained us for hours.  And the Mickey Hunt game is tons of fun as well.

In conclusion, though it's not a masterful effort like the original was, it's probably one of the better, if not the best, straight-to-video sequel Disney has ever produced.",1089936000,2,1943,4.896341463414634

This ingenious idea works great, and is told in an ingenious manner, with Timon & Pumbaa narrating from a darkened movie theater, literally showing us their side to the story. It is smart, and also hilarious. We got the DVD from Netflix, and will eventually buy it later this year when we can!
THE LION KING 1 1/2 (2004) gives us a whole new picture of the most popular Disney story of all time. Even though this is Timon & Pumbaa's story, Rafiki (Robert Guillaume, unaffected vocally by the stroke he suffered after doing THE LION KING II: SIMBA'S PRIDE in 1998) also returns, as does Simba (Matthew Broderick) and Nala (Moira Kelly). Even Whoopie Goldberg and Cheech Marin return as the vicious hyena leaders! But it's basically Timon and Pumbaa's show, showing once again how popular these characters are (they did have their own animated TV show for a few years back in the 90's), reminding us how much they make us laugh and how good they make us feel. I gotta hand it to Disney: THE LION KING 1 1/2 is an excellent concept, and is done extremely well. It may start a new trend in cinema, for however bad or good that may be. Just get it & enjoy!

But for some reason, instead of getting named The Lion King 3, it is titled ""The Lion King 1 1/2"", and since this movie came out after the Lion King and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, but never mind. As the movie opens, Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumbba (Ernie Sabella) are in a dark theatre, and Pummba is against Timon fast fowarding to the part of the Lion King when they come in, and Pumbba reminds him they were there are the time, but we don't know it. And they begin telling thier story, which begins with Timon's early days with his family, including his mom (Julie Kavner) and his Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller), and the other meekcats are upset by Timon's digging, and then his Mom puts him on a new job, watching for heeynees, which his uncle trusts him to do, but instead Timon breaks into song, and doesn't too his job until it is too late, which upsets his uncle. Later on after having a talk wit his mother, Timon sets out looking for a better home, in which he runs into Rafiki (Robert Guillaume). And Rafiki tells him him ""to look beyond what he see"". And what he see is Pride Rock, and starts to make his trip there, along the way he meets Pumbba. And he joins Timon on the trip.",1086134400,2,1318,4.213438735177865

The director is less stuck on the mystic of the original lion king and brings in good animation frames, music, and friendship.  The movie includes musical choregraphy, bright colors, and recapturing the energy of the original movie. The friendship magic between Timon and Pumbaa and Simba is not lost, instead the story transports the viewer back too Timon younger days, his disasters standing guard (which is funny), building the skylight in the burrow (also funny), his desire to adventure and departure from his mother (funny again), his rejection by the group (funny), and eventual friendship with Pumbaa and Simba (warm); you won't miss any warmth; also, included is the meeting of the wise sage, Hakuna Matata.

1933195,4,B0000E32WJ,"I bought this film for my daughter amidst mixed reviews that the film was very good, or that it slaughtered the original.  After watching it with my daughter, I was entertained in a completely different way than I expected.
This film, not a sequel but sort of a prequel and retelling rolled into one, does an incredible job of telling Timon and Pumba's story amidst the events that occur with Simba and his pride of lions.  In addition to treating us to their tale, we see scenes of Timon, Pumba, and Simba together in their (as we find out in this film) newly discovered paradise.
The most impressive aspect of this film, however, is its ability to keep the recognizable events of The Lion King in the background while still keeping Timon and Pumba's story the strongest and at times spoofing the first film.  A good example is a scene in which Timon and Pumba think they have found the perfect home until their peace is disrupted by loud singing.  Fans of the first film can recognize that the ""noisy neighbors"" (as Timon calls them) are Simba and Nala singing ""I Just Can't Wait to be King.""
This is a more appropriate film for children of all ages, while the first was perhaps too violent for very young children.  The only thing that keeps this from acquiring five stars is that it feels more like a long episode of a Timon and Pumba cartoon than a film.

1933197,4,B0000E32WJ,"Unlike, apparently, most moviegoers in the 1990s, I found the original ""Lion King"" to be far too saccharine for my tastes. A fairly bland character makes a bad decision, briefly gets mixed up with some interesting outcasts, the clock whirls forward through all that stuff, and then he goes back to fix his mistake. While I'm no fan of ""Hamlet,"" I felt ""The Lion King"" really robbed the story of much of the drama it could, and should, have had. And, frankly, I was irritated that Timon and Pumbaa got so little screen time.
""The Lion King 1 1/2"" to the rescue. Not only do we get to see Simba's time with the duo in more detail, we get to see all of ""The Lion King"" through Timon's much more cynical eyes, and the story improves for the retelling. The creators of this sequel clearly like the original movie, which is interwoven or sometimes literally used in the background of new shots, but they're also well aware of its cornier elements, and Timon is as well.
The conceit of having Timon and Pumbaa watch their own version of events on a giant television screen (seen in silhouette, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" style) is great, and allows for them to comment on the action, make fun of overly dramatic elements (""What's up with that running, if you can call that running?"" Timon asks of Pumbaa's dramatic slow motion race through desert sand) and act as audience surrogates when they buzz through the boring stuff. It's simple, but effective, and embodies the sly, sarcastic sense of the filmmakers. Set pieces from the original film are turned on their ear (""Everything the light touches ... belongs to someone else."") or gleefully skewered (""Oh, great timing, omniscient monkey!"").
The story of this sequel is a fairly classic Disney story, of the misfit character who doesn't fit in with the social norms of his environment, and sets out on an adventure that both makes him a hero and redefines his relationship to his community. In this case, it's Timon, who isn't the nervous wreck the other meerkats all are, nor, unfortunately, nearly as competent at any of the skills they think are important (i.e. tunneling and watching out for marauding hyenas). In the course of his journey to find a place where he won't have to hide underground, he encounters the flatulent Pumbaa, who is recast as part embarassing uncle, part smelly family dog, with well-observed bits brought out by both the animators and performer.
While children, especially little boys, will enjoy the gross-out humor (of which there is relatively little), for the most part, ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" is an adult film, and perhaps the first post-modern Disney movie, commenting on another Disney movie with the leading characters explicitly observing and analyzing the original events. Of course, for those looking for lots of more of what the original movie offered, they'll be disappointed -- the story is slight, the song-and-dance number is lightweight and very silly and the lions are, frankly, something of an afterthought -- but for those of us who thought the original needed a little more bitter with the sweet, this new film is a delight.

Finally, the truth comes out in this fun re-telling of the now-classic  movie, told by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog.
It begins with Timon's family of meerkats, tunneling their way through the savannah.  He doesn't feel that he belongs and wants to explore, to find the right place for him.  So he sets off across the grasslands, running into Rafiki the baboon who tells him to search beyond what he sees for Hakuna Mata.  In the grasslands, Timon runs into Pumbaa the warthog, and together, they set off in search of their paradise.  Along the way, we get to see just how Timon and Pumbaa fit into the story of Simba.  And, they happened to be everywhere, from Simba's debut to the animals to the wildebeast stampede.
I absolutely loved this movie.  Not only does it mesh well with ""The Lion King,"" but it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Timon and Pumbaa constantly break in during the film to give some kind of commentary on the scene, or to get a fresh bag of grubs.  The Disney team even managed to get many of the original voices to return: Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, Matthew Broderick as Simba, and Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas.  Some fresh, new voices have been added as well, including Julie Kavner as Timon's Ma and Jerry Stiller as his Uncle Max.

No matter how sensitive the scene was. Of course, the movie cannot be compared to The Lion King...but only total morons would think that the makers of this film planned on making this film so that it would be comparable to The Lion King. It's a parody people - accept that. I agree with other reviewers of this film when they say that the people at Disney were just trying to make some easy cash by releasing this film, but how does that harm us if the movie fulfills its purpose? It does live up to the trailer, at least, and people often view movies depending on their opinion of a movie's trailer. This is not the type of movie which I would watch repeatedly, but it is a good flick to pick if you are a Lion King fan.

Some stuff I love (the original Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Finding Nemo, etc.). On the other hand, my son, who just turned four, is pretty easy to please. As long as there's no live action, he's happy. (The exception was the pathetic Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, which could not hold his attention for even one viewing.)
But my son isn't writing this review. To Nathan Lane, I say, ""I knew Zero Mostel, he was a friend of mine, and Mr. Lane, you're no Zero Mostel!"" Indeed, Nathan Lane embodies the creative mediocrity of the age. When he was about 89, I saw the late Bob Hope (who was far from my favorite comic) for what I believe was the last time he was a late night talk show guest. When Hope, Mr. Timing, missed his mark on his one-liners, I knew it was over for him. For Nathan Lane, it never began.
Then there's the original music - oops, excepting one instantly forgettable opener, there isn't any. Some songs are recycled from the original, and others are ripped off from every source imaginable, including spaghetti westerns, though the producers didn't give proper attribution. Now, some folks will say, I'm using a sledgehammer to kill a flea; after all, it's straight-to-video. But the price is premium. I paid $25 for this dreck, and it lists at $30! If we're not supposed to expect full quality, then charge only $10 or $12, for cryin' out loud. For a premium price, you must deliver premium quality, not leftovers.
What about the story?, you ask. Don't. There is no story to speak of, just recycled characters from the original. But I really shoulda known - just check out the ""screenwriter."" Tom Rogers should rename himself either ""Tom Ripoff"" or ""Tom II."" Look at his credits: Lady and the Tramp II; Cinderella II; The Jungle Book II ... He has never been associated with a quality, original children's movie. Not only is the man a grave robber, but after robbing the dead, he commits sacrileges and abominations upon the corpses! Doesn't Nemo's Law provide special punishments and registries to govern such dastardly, repeat offenders? Where do I go to press charges for the aesthetic abuse of my son? And what about victims' services?!

But it gets worse. Fortunately, I bought this at a store. And so, when Disc II - which allegedly contains featurettes and games -- failed to function, I was able to bring it back and exchange it. But Disc II was equally defective on the second pack. (I'm bringing it back for a refund tonight.) I imagine some of the Disc IIs must work, but if I got two consecutive lemons, there must be thousands of lemons out there. And so, if you absolutely must see this, wait until you can rent it.

1933249,3,B0000E32WJ,"I bought this under the Asian-release title ""Lion King 3."" First, I'd like to point out some disappointments. One, I thought the meerkat song in the beginning was kind of weak, a song written ""just so there would be a song."" Two, maybe more of Pumbaa's story could have been told, because I wasn't really thrilled with Timon's weak history (he wasn't even kicked out! he could have left ages ago). Three, I thought the central storyline of Timon looking for a dream home was not strong enough to explain why he ran into many of the Lion King's events. And four, I thought there were too many interruptions during the movie, where Timon and Pumbaa pause it to offer some adlib; it got a little too numerous.
That said, it was very interesting to see things from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective. It was funny to see them in the middle of Simba's encounters. It was worth the time and will definitely put a smile on your face. However, I don't imagine watching this one too many times. Sort of like a stand-up comic; if you hear him more than once, it's not as good.",1078876800,7,1062,4.4512820512820515
1933250,4,B0000E32WJ,"We're all aware that not much can compare to the original Lion King film. The animation, songs, voices...everything just perfection. However, as an ardent fan of the film, and in particular Timon and Pumbaa, this was snapped up as soon it went on sale - and boy, what a nice surprise! A direct to video release that's actually decent!
This film is much of an improvement on the first ""sequel"". Simba's Pride just didn't hold any of the magic of the original story - and barely held my attention for one showing before being put onto the shelf to get dusty. I was immediately more interested in this film as I thought it's premise held much more entertainment quality. ""Yeah, I'd like to see how everything was through Timon and Pumbaa's eyes"" I thought, and I wasn't to be disappointed.
We're originally transported back to Timon's younger days to see why he came to team up with Pumbaa. It's dealt with very wittily, yet with enough warmth that you actually do care what happens to all involved. We're shown how Timon and Pumbaa meet, and how they embark on their quest for ""Hakuna Matata"". Much comedy ensues, with a revealing insight into the original film's events. Why do the animals bow at Simba's presentation at Pride Rock? Why does everyone fall over at the end of ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King?"" Watch to find out. Having eventually found their perfect home, their meeting with Simba is retold and we get to see some of Simba's teenage years - missed out in the original film. (Timon has a wonderful line during a particularly restless night looking after a young Simba - ""we're gonna get old walking across this thing"". As soon as you hear it you'll know exactly what it's getting at). Next to be dealt with is Simba's reunion with Nala and his trip home to Pride Rock to avenge his father's death. All seen in a new perspective it's all very watchable, even if you are seeing duplicated scenes that occurred in the original movie. The climax again adds more breadth to the original. With Scar and his minions vanquished and order restored in the Pridelands, Timon and Pumbaa settle into their new home with his original meerkat colony who are surprised and impressed with the new ""all-action"" Timon. This is very much Timon's film, we get to know a lot more about him than Pumbaa and it is Timon that saves the day right at the very end. That's no complaint I would add, after all we heard about some of Pumbaa's woes in the original film 10 years ago.
Disney have done a lot of things right with this film. The original cast (with the exception of Rowan Atkinson as Zazu which consistantly grates with me - he's much missed on the interactive section of the original movie's special edition too) return, and Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their vocies as Timon's nearest and dearest. Two new, annoyingly catchy songs appear within the first 15 minutes and several songs from the original make welcome returns. This isn't a big long song-fest though, I'm pleased to say. Much as I like the songs Disney movies are famed for, it is nice to give the characters time to speak and flesh themselves out in-between. Lots of scenes from the original appear again, and are interworked with the new animation reasonably well. An interesting twist is that the film is presented as if being viewed by Timon and Pumbaa in a cinema. I have seen a few reviews saying how annoying this is, but I actually find it very funny. The fact that they take shots at scenes which otherwise would be excessively cheesy is very endearing, and of course completely in character.
There are, inevitably bad points. This isn't going straight to video for nothing after all. You certainly need to have watched the original movie and know it well - and you also have to be willing to deconstruct it quite violently too. A lot of those scenes you held dear are made fun of mercilessly. They've generally interworked the timelines between the films very well, but there are a few moments when I thought ""that doesn't go"". The film is quite short - 72 minutes with lengthy end credits, but it is so fast passed that it seems even shorter to me. It doesn't quite know what age range it is heading for either, there are lots of ""kiddie jokes"", but also quite witty points that younger children won't necessarily get (I always used to wonder why my Mum insisted on watching Dangermouse with me, it's only now at 24 that I watch it and realise now). Lots of film references too. This isn't too bad in a way, it keeps everyone occupied throughout for different reasons. I'd rent it first if your not sure, but if your a Lion King fan you'll probably end up buying it anyway (you perhaps already have!)
The DVD features I actually find quite disappointing. This is a 2 disc release, and if they'd not put over 10 minutes worth of trailers on the first disc, probably could have been condensed onto one. There are several games for the youngsters including a virtual Safari, Rafiki's Challenge and a ""hidden Mickey"" hunt throughout the film. There's a supposedly funny ""mockumentary"" about Timon which I watched in total silence and a 1 minutes ""making of..."" featurette which I had to turn off half way through out of sheer irritation (not very much info about the film at all - but everyone involved is all certain how great it is). There are some storyboarded deleted scenes, with commentary from the directors as to why they were cut.
Overall, very enjoyable which surprised me greatly and made it even more fun. Don't start comparing to the original as that is pointless. I also don't think this sort of production should be carried on to other Disney films, I don't think it would work. However, the way these particular characters cry out for attention every time they're on screen, it seems fitting to let us find out more about them.
I would have rated this 5 stars but for the DVD ""extra's"" as the film I cannot fault, both for the entertainment value and the way it tells an unexpectedly heartwarming story without being too cringeworthy",1078531200,34,6023,4.614165890027959

The story focuses mainly on Timon, who leaves home b/c he doesnt like/fit in with the meerkat ways of life. On the way he teams up with Pumbaa and the two wander around the set of the first movie, and end up settling down in the Oasis they are in when they find Simba in LK1. You get a really cute look into what Simbas childhood was like having Timon and Pumbaa as parents, and you follow the loveable pair as they take out the Hyenas while Simba is fights with Scar in the showdown from no 1. plus a bit more at the end which I wount ruin for you.
The whole thing is filled with witty references and jokes on the original, with original music, new music, and some stratigicly placed classics that everyone can recognize.
All in all this was very cute movie, the only reason it didn't get all five stars is b/c of a few timeline glitches, and the fact that Pride Rock is always pointing the same way no matter what side of it your on.
Also you don't really learn anymore about Pumbaa that you would by watching the first one, so this is really mostly Timon's story, but being a Timon fan that doesn't bug me. I strongly recomend this to any Lion King fan!

There is one inside joke after another, each one guaranteed to bring a smile to the face of adults and raucous laughter from the kids, but let's face it, this is a direct to DVD release.  Compared to other ""direct to""s, it's superior.  And it's arguably more fun than Treasure Planet for example.  Pop it in the player and it will keep the little ones enthralled for an hour or so.",1078099200,,771,4.517985611510792

I was relieved -- if you like potty humor, that may be the only slightly amusing thing in it.  The timelines and plot (such as it is) make no sense, and the little humor there is is at the expense of the original movie.  I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental.  Michael Eisner is taking Disney down the toilet a bit too literally with this one.",1078012800,12,465,4.133333333333334
1933284,5,B0000E32WJ,"I am a semi-serious 7th. But even I had to laugh when I watched this movie!

 Basically, the story is about our meerkat friend-Timon! He tells about his story, and also about what he was doing during Simba's adventures. It also explains how Timon and pumbaa met. Brilliant.

 Very funny. Timon's reference to, ""I see dead people!"" was genius, along with the antics of Timon's Ma and Uncle, Max, who nare voiced by Julie Kavner, voice of Marge, I believe, from the Simpsons, and Jerry Stiller, King O' Queens. They both play their parts perfectly, (well, ALMOST) which is refreshing.

 Now, about the songs. They are almost as good as the ones from The Lion King I, and better than Lion King II. Hey!  1 1/2!(almost..) Errr... ANYWAY, two songs, Digga Tunnah, and That's All I Need, (written by Sir Elton John) are incredibly catchy. I love 'em all. And ,old timers, you may recognize a couple of songs...

 This bathroom humor I've been hearing about, is ... TAME!!! What I mean is, it's a little gross, but not majorly, but is STILL funny!

 My only complaints are about the timing of some parts. How could the Hyenas hear Scar betray them if they were busy with Timon and Pumbaa? How could the ""Just Can't Wait To Be King"" scene happen one day after Simba was born??? Growth spurt? I think not.

 Bottom line, watch #1 before 1 1/2. Also, we get to see ""teenage"" Simba, and an ironic playing of ""Sunrise, Sunset..."" LOL. I love the Lion King, and I hope you do to. Thanks for reading my review! Peace Out.",1078012800,3,1507,4.4963235294117645
1933285,4,B0000E32WJ,"I was hesitant to see this movie because I find that the Disney sequels are just cash cows for the Disney corporation. But, I enjoyed this film. I thought it was very cute. Nathan Lane, did a wonderful job with the sarcastic/naive Timon. It was very comical and cute.",1077926400,,267,4.469387755102041
1933286,4,B0000E32WJ,"I got this movie not knowing what to expect, and I'll admit, I was very surprised! Before I begin my review, in my opinion, The Lion King 1 1/2 is either one of those movies you're either going to hate or absolutely love. I happen to love it. :) However, when you start the movie, expect comedy, not the majestic story that The Lion King and its first sequel were famous for. While still having its own plot (it's simple but very effective), the new movie could still be considered a parody.
I'm sure many of you have heard of Timon and Pumbaa's role in the Circle of Life scene from the original movie through advertisements. If you haven't... well, I won't spoil it for you! For those of you who have heard of what they planned for the scene, I was worried about exactly how Disney planned to do but it worked nicely. Absolutely hilarious...
The continuity with the original movie went very well (and yes, in my opinion, that even includes Timon's ""Who's the monkey?"" question in the first movie). The only place that it didn't seem to quite fit together was the ending where Timon and Pumbaa were trying to distract the hyenas, but after thinking it through for awhile, I suppose it did fit together. My criticism there is that they could have made it more clear, but I'm nitpicky like that. Please excuse my vagueness, again, I'm trying not to spoil anything here!
The animation is beautiful and fits in very well with the movie. Be sure to compare Timon's ""That's All I Need"" song to Simba's ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" in the first movie and you'll see how they even took the care to use the same themes for graphic design... and the ""I Just Can't Want to Be King"" segment in the new movie, check the graphics there. Haha... hilarious. There are a few other cases like that, but I'm not going to mention them. Watch the movie and find out for yourself!
Jokes galore! If you really want to get full enjoyment out of the movie, you'll need to A) watch The Lion King again first (unless you already practically memorized the movie), B) watch the movie more than one time in a row (the second time was much more enjoyable), and C) watch it with friends. There are so many jokes that refer to so many other things it helps if there's SOMEBODY there who can catch the joke and explain it to you. There were a few jokes I didn't fully get until my Jewish friend explained them to me.
The new characters (Timon's Mom and Uncle Max) are great. I also gained a better appreciation for Rafiki during the movie -- what can I say? It's nice for a change when somebody ELSE hits him with the stick...
As for the DVD extras, no, there were not as many as on The Lion King Special Edition, but please note that The Lion King Special Edition was just that -- a special edition! While there are less, I found the extras on this DVD to be more enjoyable than the ones on the special edition DVD (although the multi-language track thing on that DVD was pretty cool... but I'm off-topic!)
I'm giving the movie a four. As for criticisms it would be that in places the movie either moved too fast (I find it hard to believe that the ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" scene took place a day after ""The Circle of Life"" scene as the new movie seemed to suggest) or too slowly (which was part of the comedy, but seemed slightly overdone). My other criticism would be in the animation near the beginning of the movie with the hyenas, that's the only place that I remember where the characters just didn't quite look right. However that problem seemed to be fixed as the movie went along.
My suggestion? Buy the movie, or at least rent it. Come on, seeing ""teen"" Simba is worth it, LOL! The Lion King 1 1/2 gave me a new appreciation for many of the characters. I consider it a very good sequel... interquel... ""behind-the-scenes-quel"" whatever the heck it is. :P",1077667200,5,3840,4.387096774193548
1933287,3,B0000E32WJ,"This home video release could best be described as ""Hope and Crosby Meets Mystery Science 3000"" for it has the same over-the-topness of the ""Road"" pictures and the Sci-Fi Channel series.
Revisiting many of the pivotal events of ""The Lion King"", the movie is interpreted by characters Timon and Pumbaa who also are watching the film from the comfort of a studio screening room. The fact that the pair frequently ""pause"" the film to interject some amusing repartee adds to the enjoyment. The tongue is placing firmly in cheek with their many ""in-jokes"" and references to popular culture.
Of course, utilizing the talents of original's stars is an added bonus. As for new ""voices"",  Former ""Rhoda"" featured player Julie Kavner and comedy legend Jerry Stiller both have strong turns as Timon's mom and uncle, respectively.

I could do with less references to ""bathroom"" humor, but I felt like this was very tactfully handled. Most of the humor, as usual these days, will appeal to older children and adults. I am cautious about small children seeing it. (Although, they seem to have perfect understanding of that sort of humor.) I also thought that the way it blended the original movie with this angle was well done and thought out. I didn't see very much to disagree with in this version as far as the blending. I think however, without spoiling it, the end was quite delightful. I could almost give it a five, but I just can't quite, but only because of the bathroom humor, which is nowhere what is in most live action movies at all.

The jokes and puns are hilarious and classic.  You'll laugh out loud, and good for all ages.  Besides the jokes, it also has heart, which really makes a movie a film.  The ""Who Wants to be King of the Jungle"" game is challenging, but Timon's wisecracks continue to entertain.  I also love the ""Hidden Mickey"" hunt - where you watch the movie for hidden Mickey ear icons drawn slyly in the background.  At the end it gives you a score to see how well you did!

And there are numerous overlaps with the original movie as though
Timon and Pumbaa were just standing offstage when the original action was being filmed. Absolutely clever and witty!

It begins by telling the story of how Timon left his home and ventured out on  his own - once you get past this part, the movie really picks up. The story of the original Lion King is intertwined here as Timon's perspective is revealed. You learn how Timon & Pumbaa met, how they cared for Simba, ...I don't want to give too much away here.

This is a new twist in sequels! Though not every Disney classic could be retold like this (nor would we want them to try!), this movie tells the story from a different angle, a different perspective - and succeeds! The original voices are back, Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), Timon (Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), etc. It just wouldn't be the same without them.  There are some catchy tunes - (though not as good as the original Lion King).

In the middle of some of the scenes, Pumba or Timone would stop the video which I thought was annoying and distracting.
This movie stank because it was not about Simba, but more about Timone.  For that reason, I was very disappointed.  His character is very annoying and he's NOT strong enough or appealing enough to be a lead!  I suspect that the guy that did Timone's voice was the executive producer, because he was in every scene.  The story was so weak that I cannot write about it or describe it. What was the point of this movie?  It displayed scence from the original movie--which I loved--but it did not offer me anything except a little bit of backgroun on Timone.

Turns out, Timon left home to find a safer, more free place to live, and learned ""Hakuna Matata"" from Rafiki. He then met Pumbaa (whose past is hinted at, though not explored; Timon is more of the star), and the clever interweaving of Lion King 1 and Lion King 1.5 began. Basically, Timon and Pumbaa followed the original story but didn't know it until they met young Simba and lived with him in the jungle. Because in their quest to find a permanent residence, they continually meet up with the lions, hyenas, etc., in places like the Elephant Graveyard and the gorge where the stampede took place and killed Mufasa. Cute? Yes, but we're expected to believe that the only reason the animals bowed to Prince Simba was because Pumbaa was marching though them and emitting foul-smelling gas. Funny, yeah...but hopefully not true! The only really good ""fart joke"" in this movie is the bubbling of the jungle sauna; as soon as the warthog steps out, the bubbles cease, causing Simba and Timon to rush out, sickened. It's a subtle, funny joke. The hyenas are in this movie enough, but Zazu really isn't; he has a couple of phony baloney lines. The same is true in the Lion King 2; his great role in the first movie is truly his only shining moment. Which is sad! But anyway, the music in this movie is comme ci, comme ca....the meerkat ""dig a tunnel"" song is, however catchy, annoying and pretty unoriginal. Timon's little ditty about ""That's all I need"" has a couple of lines that actually show some creative songwriting, but on the whole, the things that really make this move entertaining for a couple of viewings are the Timon's family jokes, and the way the story moves through the events of the first from a different perspective.

  Quite Frankly, this is the absolute funniest movie of all of the Lion King movies.
 The scene where Timon leaves home is one to remember.
  In this brand new movie, Disney meticulously shows us how Timon and his pal Pumbaa have actually have been involved in just about every aspect of the original Lion King movie, even if we didn't see them  there........They were there....just beyond our vision.
 We also learn how Timon and Pumbaa first met.
  And, we learn that Timon and Pumbaa lent their ""Parental talents"" to the life of Simba, in ways that we never knew!
  Ever wonder what happened between the time we see Simba, Timon and Pumbaa walking across that log, when Simba switches from a young cub to a mature Lion? You don't have to wonder anymore, because this movie tells you what happened.
  This movie has some great surprises, and many, many laughs.
 Timon is a riot and Pumbaa is a..........gas. ""Oops, sowwy"".
  Well my comedic talents may be lacking, but Timon, Pumbaa and the rest of the Lion King gang will have you cracking up!
  Make no mistake...this isn't just another ""Kid's movie"". No, adults will get a kick out of this movie as well.
 This movie is a worthy addition to the other two Lion King movies and it is funnier than the first two.
 The story is great as well, and one of the bonus features includes the legendary Peter Graves saluting the unforgettable Timon!
 This is a two disc set packed with fun stuff.
 It even features a ""Spot Mickey Mouse"" game that will have you watching the movie again and again just to try and figure out where all the Mickey Mouse symbols are in the movie.

My son and I love the Lion King, but this one is just ok.
The animation, voice talents, and music are fantastic.  The story...well there is none.  There is no independent story here of Pumba and Timon, just inserts on how they affected every piece of the original story.  Really lacking originality.
That being said, it was worth it for true fans.  There were a few funny jokes for adults.  An older child might think it was hilarious since it pokes fun at the original Lion King, but I think younger viewers just won't get it and won't find it engaging.
In general it is worth the buy for Lion King fans, but don't expect much.  (Lion King I is excellent by the way, and Lion King II while kind of dark and violent...it sort of grows on you.)",1076544000,7,745,4.285714285714286

This movie defeats all odds! It has a good time length of 77 mins., and the animation is definitely movie theatere quality! The original cast is back (Mathew Broderick, Whoopie Goldberg, Nathan Lane, etc.) and it has a ton of funny references to the original. It's very original, and a lot of people are saying it should have been in theateres instead of Jungle Book 2 and so on. Go buy this movie NOW!",1076457600,6,601,4.788461538461538

For them, the Lion King 1 1/2 gets five stars all the way; we've already watched it three times.  They both like it very much.  If you are an adult who enjoyed the first Lion King movie, and so want to watch the second, you might be disappointed.  This movie simply cannot compare with the Oscar-nominated original (a fact that shouldn't be a surprise, given its release straight to DVD).

It is better than 99% of animated movies which you will ever see at the movies.  This DVD has the look and production quality of a feature film and not a cheap direct to video movie.  It is a cute, alternate take on the well-known Lion King story.  All the original voice talents are back as well as quality new talents.  I hope Disney ends this franchise on a high note and resists the urge to make Lion King 1 3/4.",1076457600,5,530,4.1568627450980395
1933479,4,B0000E32WJ,"I don't trust straight-to-video sequels for cartoons. In most cases, straight-to-video sequels are terrible, no matter how good (or bad) the original was. The list of Disney sequels I've had to suffer through for my kids is long -- ""Little Mermaid 2,"" ""Pocahontas 2,"" ""Lady and the Tramp 2,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame 2"" (ugh!), and yes, even ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"" -- these and many more are examples of why the straight-to-video sequel should be avoided as much as possible.
Usually.
""The Lion King 1 1/2"" is the exception to the rule. It's a sequel with much of the heart of its predecessor, and a good helping of originality as well. It manages to make lighthearted fun of the original ""Lion King"" while remaining true to the spirit of it, something I wasn't sure could be done. It's not a parody, exactly, but it does manage to take some of the very serious, dramatic scenes from the original and put a funny spin on them. For example, want to know why all the animals started bowing to baby Simba on Pride Rock at the beginning of Lion King? You get to find out here... when I saw this part, I was rolling on the floor.
I was a little worried at the beginning of ""Lion King 1 1/2,"" when there were a couple of original songs which seemed like cheap knockoffs, and the story had a hard time finding its legs. However, once we got through this part (basically, once Timon leaves his meerkat home), the movie really starts to pick up. The ""good part"" of the movie really starts about one-third of the way in, and once it starts it doesn't stop until the end.
The animation is better than most of the Disney straight-to-video sequels, though not quite on a par with the theatrical-release movies. Still, the animation quality is better than expected, and it was a nice touch to have all of the voice talent from the original ""Lion King"" reprising their roles for this film.
Sure, there's a couple fart jokes and other examples of fairly juvenile humor. But, what do you expect, it's a movie intended for kids. My daughters all loved it, and frankly, many of these jokes were done so well that they had me laughing too.
To put it bluntly, I'd have to say that ""Lion King 1 1/2"" is the flat-out funniest movie Disney's put out since ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" which is one of my favorites in the recent Disney catalog. I expected the movie to try for lots of humor, but what I didn't expect were many of the clever and funny twists on the story of ""The Lion King.""
What came through loud and clear was that the makers of this film clearly loved the original ""Lion King"" as much as I did, and showed it by making a new movie which pokes well-intentioned fun at the original, even as it pays a faithful homage to it. In my opinion, nicely done and well worth owning.
Color me very pleasantly surprised.",1076371200,11,2810,4.4476744186046515
1933550,5,B0000E32WJ,"Pros and Cons:
Pros: The Honky Tonk Special Effects blew my socks off the bed... and I had to eventually recover my socks several days later, but that's not the point. The actual movie features a voice cast including James Bond, Christopher Walken, and Tupac Shakur (they had to take remnants of interviews and assimilate it into the movie). Furthermore, the plot is so hot it makes my blood clot into a big knot. So I recommend this to both kids and adults.
Cons: I didn't see Steve Buscemi or Nicolas Cage in this movie, so I guess its safe to assume that the cons do not exist. Yes, yes, the rumors are false, Timon & Pumbaa DO NOT get thrown in prison.
Once again, I recommend this to both adults and children, but the animal savagery could be a little to hardcore for peeps over 89.",1076371200,2,787,4.360544217687075

1933552,4,B0000E32WJ,"Disney's latest direct-to-video sequel The Lion King 1 1/2 is a delightful and charming comedic romp. We see events before, during and inbetween the major events of The Lion King. In lampooning the original film, the director and writers have made an entertaining alternative to the original film looking at events from the Rosencrantz and Guildensten of the story (if the ""Hamlet"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" analogy mentioned in the booklet is to be believed).
The animation is light years better than the average Saturday morning cartoon and the witty writing helps overcome any bumps in the road of telling a variation on the same story. The DVD begins by introducing us to Timon prior to meeting Pumba. Timon can't do anything right and his Uncle (played with comic zest by Jerry Stiller of Seinfeld and King of Queens fame) and his Mom (Julie Kavner from The Simpsons) are really the only two willing to give him a second chance. Needless to say, when Timon meets Rafiki for the first time and he gives Timon advice on where to find his place in the world, things get really goofy and funny. Most of the original voice cast appears in the DVD and the new song, although not quite up to ""Circle of Life"", is quite charming.
When Timon finally meets Pumba, they manage to intersect with Simba's life without actually meeting him (and Scar as well as the Hyenas from the first film). They eventually find their place in the world when they ""adopt"" Simba and raise him. The parody of night feedings and the lack of sleep for new parents was a chuckle. There's also plenty of film parodies along the way including The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (with Ennio Moricone's famous theme music) and Fidler on the Roof (""Sunrise, Sunset"" gets it here). They're also not above making fun of their own hit song during a bizarre sing-along during the film.
The 77 minute film is paced well for little children and has enough witty lines, kid-style jokes and adventure to keep kids entertained. The extras are all on the second disc and include a number of cool interactive bits. ""The Making of Lion King 1 1/2 "" is mercifully short and entertaining. ""Behind the Legend"" makes fun of Biography with a peak at Timon's life. There's also 12 minutes of deleted scenes some of which are as much fun as the final film. There's also a music video starring Raven designed to make you want to go out and buy the soundtrack.
""Timon and Pumbaa;s Virtual Safari 1.5"" are the duo's self made theme park ride that takes pokes at the classic Disney rides. ""Who Wants to be King of the Jungle"" is a tired variation on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". It's interactive enough to make it entertaining for a short while. Finally, there's ""Hidden Mickey Hunt"" was pretty good for little ones. Oh, thee's also the weak interactive activity ""Find the Face"" where your supposed to select the correct picture of the character that matches the silhouette.
On the whole, The Lion King 1 1/2 shows a huge improvement in Disney direct-to-DVD films. The quality is solid and inspired much of the time and the second disc of games although not always successful, is still entertaining for kids. On the whole I'd have to give TLK 1 1/2 4 stars for entertainment value and the creativity that's gone into the project.",1076371200,5,3270,4.649395509499136

It's fun.  Is it as good as The Lion King?
No.
Is it as good as Lion King II?
What isn't?
But Lion King 1 1/2 isn't meant to be taken too seriously as a Prequel/Sequel/Concurrentquel(?). It's an irreverent romp through the Lion King universe as seen through the eyes of Timon and Pumbaa.  I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the DVD so that my son and I could regain our composure after laughing so hard.  The new songs are cute and stand up against some of the other songs in the Disney oeuvre.
Some critics have lamented at the flatulence jokes when there were none in the original film.  Did you people actually see the Lion King? Pumbaa is one big bag o' gas beginning to end. Same here and maybe more so.
Will Lion King 1 1/2 win any awards? Probably not; but it's a nice diversion from the usual stale Direct-to-Video Disney films. You know who you are Cinderella II...",1076371200,4,939,4.258426966292135
1933554,1,B0000E32WJ,"Disney, the word itself brings images of magic, great storytelling and fun and entertaining. This movie is none of these. I noticed right from the start that I was annoyed watching this film. The constatnt interuption of Timones ""remote"",which I assume was supposed to be clever, turns out to be annoying. What was Disney Thinking??? Unoriginal in every way. It actually ruins my ability to even want to watch the original ""Lion King""! As endearing as Timone and Pumba are, they can't pull a whole feature on their own. Sorry Disney. I'm even sorrier I forked over twenty hard earned dollars for this ""film"".
This film is only a rehash of the first one, who realy cares about these two guys. I know I didn't come away feeling very entertained. This is Disney recycled. Save your money folks.

1933555,4,B0000E32WJ,"The only real problem I have with this movie is that it blatantly rips off ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" without giving it any credit. Other than that, ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" is great! (And this review is coming from someone who absolutely LOATHES ""Simba's Pride"" and all the other Disney sequels.)  This movie is not meant to be a serious piece but rather a jocular romp that retells a fantastic story from a different viewpoint. (Those that say ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" makes the first film seem cheap or unwatchable are taking things too seriously.)
I loved the original Lion King when I was a kid and now that I'm an adult it's still one of my favorites. Having been very dissapointed with the second movie, I didn't hold much hope for this ""interquel.""  I was pleasantly surprised! The animation, while not as sharp as the original's, is far better than most direct-to-video efforts. The new characters (Timon's mother and Uncle Max) are enjoyable and never annoying or out of place. With the exception of Rowan Atkinson, all the original voice talent has returned; a rare feat for a Disney direct-to-video project! It was fun to get a new perspective on classic scenes, and it was also great to see more of the cute half-grown Simba!
Some jokes are a bit old, but Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella work enough charm to make them enjoyable. There's an odd balance to the comedy at times; some scenes are just for kids (Pumbaa's gas problem, the slug-eating contest, etc.), while some philosophical jargon and pop cultural references (""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" etc.) are put in just for the parents and will probably confuse the under-12 crowd. However, it all works out in the end. If you're wary of another Lion King movie after being burned by ""Simba's Pride"" or other Disney sequels, I urge you to give this one a fair chance. You'll be surprised what an open mind can do. 4.5/5 stars",1076371200,,1916,4.699404761904762

1933557,2,B0000E32WJ,"I agree that the trailer for this movie was ingenious, but as with most quick, straight to video releases, the overall quality of this movie, in my opinion, is very poor.  I loved the original Lion King, and it will always stand out in my mind... but this movie really upsets me ina  number of areas.  In one scene Timon and Pumbaa comically decide to run for their lives from the stampeding herd in the gorge.  As I recall that was a very sad scene in the original movie, where Mufasa was killed and Simba was run off.  I hardly thought that a good scene to make funny and light by Timon and Pumbaa.
There are plenty other scenes that are badly parodied.  The original scene with Simba majestically running home to reclaim his birthright is laughable in the wrong way when Pumbaa runs back to Pride Rock.
Another point that bothered me about this film was the music.  One song, the Warthog Rhapsody that was never used in the first film, was poorly plagiarized in Timon's sentry song.  Another song, Lebo M's ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" was also slapped into this movie from its original appearance on the CD ""Rhythm of the Pride Lands"".
The only thing really going for this movie is the innocent humor... something that a younger audience would enjoy.  I for one did not see the depth that I so loved in the original Lion King, and I'm heart-broken by how this movie makes terrible fun of the original's very serious events.",1076112000,4,1424,4.509727626459144
