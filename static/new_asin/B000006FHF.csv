The VHS tape is also in perfect condition with no skips or wavy lines.

Thank you!

The flintstones has always seemed to have a simplicity of cartooning that has made it so comfortable to relate to the stories. This particular story had some good musical sequences and the fun appeal of the supposed starlet hiding out just trying to get away from her fast paced life for a bit. I like the idea of letting your own kids see some of the things you liked as a kid. Though they may not enjoy it the same way you did,its still fun to see them initially complain because anything less than X-BOX they think of as boring, and then in spite of this they actually enjoy it anyway. Yes, sadly sometimes they need to be convinced of what's good for them.",1296604800,,779,4.23489932885906
7904375,5,B000006FHF,"OK, right off the bat, I will state that of the two epsisodes on this  great collectible for Flintstones/Hanna-Barbara fans, I have only watched  the ""Stony Curtis"" ep once or twice, while the number of times  I've watched ""Ann-Margrock Presents"" about 50. OK, I'm a diehard  Ann-Margret fan, so sue me.
Before I get into that, one thing that is  notable about this episode was that it marked an important moment in TV  history- the first time a celebrity played themself in a cartoon, back in  the early 60's. Even Entertainment Weekly put this on their list of  ""Top 100 TV Moments in History"", because it led the way for other  animated characters voiced by their real-life counterparts-the Simpsons do  this constantly, among many others, but this episode paved the  way.
Ann-Margret fans, this is a must for your collection if you don't  have it already. I was so happy when they reissued it on video, and at such  a great price. The plot of the cute episode is when Hollywood starlet  Ann-Margrock tools into town in her little Flintstonesmobile (convertible,  of course) for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, telling her manager  that she doesn't want anyone to know who she is. She runs into Fred and  Barney, who of course don't recognize her. She babysits Pebbles and sings  her a sweet lullaby called ""The Littlest Lamb"", and of course  charms the whole family. They decide she deserves a shot at show business  (ok, the plot is kind of fuzzy here, but you get the idea) and work on a  little song-and-dance routine with her. She humors them and they go down to  her performance at the Hollywood Bowl, but bone-headedly wonder how they  are going to break it to her that she isn't going to make it onstage, while  the rest of the Flintstones gang watch on TV at home. Get ready to hit the  rewind button again and again when the announcer comes out and announces,  ""Ladies and Gentlemen...Ann-Margrock!!"" From backstage, Fred and  Barn in unison: ""wh--ANN-MARGROCK?"" and she kicks in to a great  rendition of ""I Ain't Gonna be Your Fool No More"", one of the  catchiest songs AM recorded in the 60's. You also get to see the great  beatnik back-up band, playing instruments that are actually stone-age  animals (think musical versions of Wilma's famous elephant vacuum cleaner,  etc) rockin' along in the background. You can tell all of the animators  involved were infatuated with Ann-Margret, (like every other breathing male  on the planet was at the time), because the cartoon version of her mimics  her little go-go dance moves and mannerisms perfectly. I know someone who  said if he ever decides to get a tattoo, it's gonna be a cartoon of  Ann-Margrock. After you watch this episode, you might be tempted too! Just  adorable, and like I said, the song is one of her catchiest and most  endearing, and you can tell the real Ann-Margret had a blast doing the  show. The ""Stony Curtis"" episode is amusing, too, (especially  when Wilma and Betty swoon in his presence...though if you ask me, Rock  Quarry was hotter) but Ann-Margrock is an impossible act to follow!
