3922169,5,B002FLOTQ8,I watched one of these episodes on T.V. one day and was hooked.  I wanted to see the rest of the episodes. I wanted to see them from the very start. When I found them here on Amazon I was excited and had to buy them.  I checked the prices at Best Buy and Walmart for these four seasons and they were pretty pricey if I bought them individually.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I love it!!!!!!!,1260230400,9,397,3.9873417721518987

8369151,5,B002FLOTQ8,"The Ghost Whisper Series was as good as I remembered it, dealt with real life and gives insight into what may happen when we die, I think JLH is one of these actresses that take the roles to heart and make it seem very real she draws you in and her eyes they are just lovely and show real emotion when people who have passed and cannot find their way to the light once she helps them and the go towards the light she cries and because she is such a great actress you believe that she is really doing this, you forget you are watching a series and think it is for real, well I do anyway.

If anyone out there is wondering whether or not to buy the dvd's I would recommend them to anyone because the series is fantastic.",1349654400,,718,4.056338028169014

I got Ghost Whisperer: Seasons 1-4 and I highly recommended it to any fan of this show!!! I am just waiting for a release date of Season Five and I will be purchasing that one as well. My purchase was delivered promptly and before estimated delivery date.

SHOW OVERVIEW

For those of you like me who would pass by this show because of its supernatural ties, know that it is full of substance, not relying on any dazzling paranormal special effects to compensate for lack of depth. As another reviewer notes, the show uses the ghosts to explore human relationships, both among the living and the dead, rather than just for scares or oohs and ahhs. To classify it, the show is a drama with some laughs, romance, mystery, and moments of horror mixed in. I adore this show, but I admit it has its melodramatic or corny/sappy moments.

CHARACTERS: Even more so than plot and Melinda's day-to-day hauntings, Ghost Whisperer is about quality character development. The main characters are likable, and relatable, despite their extraordinary brushes with the afterlife. A few episodes in, and you feel like you know them personally, so you care about them. Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the gifted protagonist who runs an antique shop, is simply a good person: she's compassionate, thoughtful, empathetic, and genuine. You admire her. She also maintains her relatability--when she tears up, so will you! Though I agree with many viewers that the generous necklines characteristic of her wardrobe are needlessly distracting, and Hewitt's fake lashes are a bit too much, somehow Melinda's down-to-earth personality seems genuine enough that you grow to overlook her showcasing.

Melinda's husband, Jim Clancy (David Conrad), a paramedic and firefighter, is similarly sincere. He's sensitive, caring, understanding, and supportive, all while upholding his masculinity, refreshingly. As a couple, Melinda and Jim share a touching emotional connection--and perhaps too perfect a relationship, some say. But this is my response: Shows do not offer us a look at any character's life 24/7. What we are shown are the times that best exemplify the characters. If in the first episode and multiple ones thereafter, we had seen Jim and Melinda get in a tiff, what would our impression be of their relationship as a whole? We'd think their marriage was tumultuous. Instead, we are offered a picture of a typically harmonious couple, so that when there IS a conflict, we immediately realize the gravity of the issue pitting them against each other.

Melinda's character evolution seems natural. Her wardrobe also becomes less eclectic as she gains greater footing in the spiritual world and boosts her confidence and experience. There are a few cast changes/additions over the seasons, including the inexplicable sudden aging of one child character. I think these changes are positive, aside from the addition of Jaime Kennedy's character Eli, who I think utterly lacks charm.

PLOT: Storylines per episode involve Melinda communicating with earthbound spirits and the loved ones those spirits left behind, helping them conduct their ""unfinished business with the living."" They start with an encounter and end with what always aims to be a poignant, upbeat closure. While I agree with some viewers that the plots are predictable to the point of redundancy, I disagree that such patterning detracts from the show. Just look at crime shows like CSI. You know there is going to be some wrongdoing, and that the show will likely open with the event and close with the crime's resolution and the capture of the culprit. But you still watch the show, and perhaps you even re-watch episodes even once the mystery is gone because you want to revisit a particular storyline or character. That's how it is with Ghost Whisperer.

Underlying these spurts of action--and increasing in presence as the seasons progress--is a greater, more sinister plot: the growing power among the dark earthbound spirits.

SPECIAL FEATURES

There are a good number of special features throughout the seasons, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, and blooper reels (which are not there for every episode), as well as interactive games; behind-the-scenes sneak-peeks at wardrobe, ghost make-up, the cast, and the music; and miscellaneous tidbits such as ""A Tour of Grandview"" and ""Ghost Whisperer Mythology.""

**Note: The Season One box reads, ""Some music has been changed in this home entertainment version,"" and Season Two reads, ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network version,"" without specifying how.

*A NOTE ON WHERE TO BUY*
Amazon does not offer the best deal as of right now. Here are some of the competitors' prices as of June 9, 2011:

Wal-Mart: $94.96, Barnes and Noble: $79.95; not carried at Target, Books a Million, Borders, or Best Buy",1273968000,2,4607,5.2192151556156965
8369155,5,B002FLOTQ8,"What can I say? I'd heard about this show when it first aired but never watched a single episode mainly because I just kinda forgot about it. Then, some months ago, I see that SciFi is broadcasting a number of episodes in a row and, on a whim, I sat down to watch. I got hooked, even from watching eps from season 3 and not having any background from the previous seasons.

The show has a nice element of creepiness, an occasional touch of horror, suspense, intrigue, and can also make you laugh. And it can get rather touching, too. The show really does a nice job of blending a lot of emotions together without going to one extreme or the other. The pacing of the stories is good and even though there's an occasional, noticeable, storyline pattern detectable when watching one episode after another, it doesn't take away from the show due to the solid writing.

It's a good show. Check it out.",1271635200,5,896,4.4573170731707314
