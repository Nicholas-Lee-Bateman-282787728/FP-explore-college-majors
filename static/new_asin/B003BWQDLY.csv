8394039,5,B003BWQDLY,Nati Cano does an wonderful art of teaching the different instruments and styles of Mariachi music.  This should a neccesary DVD for all future students of this wonderful music.  I recommend it.,1389052800,,194,5.03125
8394040,3,B003BWQDLY,"Its more like a teaser there are no real lessons in the DvD it's more to give a quick overview of the styles and a look at  the different instruments role in the Mariachi. It has some cool additional documentaries about the charro suit makers, string makers, and a music store. The best part for me was the section of the disc where the Camperos play as normal.",1308096000,,361,4.3088235294117645
