7984218,4,B00008H2G1,"This volume was easaly one of the most over priced at $25 when brand new on amazon the first episode just expands on the story which is okay, but the duel with yugi and mai just dumb because yugi spends half the duel trying to win on his own without the spirt's help otherwise he might hurt mai almost like he almost killed kiaba in face-off but in the feild their using i don't see how he could really hurt mai but when you think about it they're in the castle playing on the duel arena not using duel disks while one of them is on the eage of a castle's walls, but the duel's only real attraction is BLS it's cool how in each duelist kingdom finals duel there is a new big monster from yugi. The odd thing is also Volume 10 for season two was/is overpriced and I don't know why. Is it because of Mia?",1314144000,,802,4.050314465408805
