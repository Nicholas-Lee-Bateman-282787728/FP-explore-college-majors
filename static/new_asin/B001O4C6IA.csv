3726743,5,B001O4C6IA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD! I am not a hard core yoga person.  For me yoga is something that complements the other fitness activities that I do.  In fact, before I did the first segment I had been on the elliptical for 15 minutes, done 40 minutes of strength exercises and 15 minutes of stretching.  I had also worked out prior to trying the second segment.

I think this DVD would be good to use after a workout to provide some stretching and flexibility. I also think it would be good after a long day at work to relieve stress.  I like the 20 minute segments as they are easy to fit in anyplace.

The words Hemalayaa uses to describe the DVD are ""fun"", ""joyful"", ""smile"".  I think these are good descriptions.  I'm easily bored by yoga DVDs that are so serious, and seem to go on forever.  She does have some mantras/chants (yum, rum) and also some funny facial expressions.  I am NOT a chanting person, but in the spirit Hemalayaa does them they are simply fun.  If you don't feel like doing them, then don't (or smile that she does them).  The expressions - well you can do them or not, but they are also in the same fun spirit.

The poses are not difficult, but I also think the DVD is not boring. (I've been burned by ""beginner"" yoga DVDs that could put me to sleep.)  I think she has done a good job of putting together a DVD that will appeal to a wide audience, not just very serious yoga followers (in fact, it may be the more serious yoga followers that have the most trouble with this DVD).

When I finished both practices, I felt cheerful, more flexible and  relaxed.  There are differences between the two practices, although they are also similar.  That might be the one improvement she could have made - to distinguish between the practices a little more.

I have a bad knee and the only pose I skipped was the warrior pose in the second practice.  I was able to adjust all other poses to respect my knee.",1262304000,10,1924,4.336134453781512
3726744,5,B001O4C6IA,"This is the 3rd Hemalayaa DVD that I have purchased and love this one just as much as the other two.
Hemalayaa puts her whole soul into her products and she totally exudes fun and her unique personality into each workout.
I highly recommend it.",1255910400,,244,4.444444444444445
3726745,4,B001O4C6IA,I love Hemalayaa and all of her dvds. I have had difficulty finding a yoga dvd that is not too complicated (trying to bend me in ways that my body is just not ready to go) and not too instructional (I get bored with overly instructional yoga dvds).,1252713600,2,248,4.1875
3726746,4,B001O4C6IA,"I've done the first part 4 or 5 times now.  At first I was a bit put off by the ""yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm""ing and tongue-sticking-outing, but that does seem to be a good way to release tension.  This gets 4 rather than 5 stars because the breathing can be rushed in places, but there's no reason why you can't do them more slowly.  I think I wind up doing 3 lungs for every 4 she does. You do have to watch the directions the first time through (later, you should be able to do them without watching, when your face is away from the screen).  But to balance that out, there is a brief medition/quiet time at the end of the routines.  I can definitely tell I'm working while doing this, but even in my currently grossly overweight and out of shape state I finished (with a few breathers).  But best of all, I really do feel more relaxed and calm after finishing.

I haven't done the second part yet because I've enjoyed the first so much, but I'll give it a try this weekend.",1251417600,4,968,4.256830601092896
3726747,5,B001O4C6IA,"I'm not a yoga star, not even close. I've tried a few yoga classes at my gym and at a couple different Yoga centers and have been left feeling completely inept. I'd been looking for a fun introduction to yoga and this is it. Maybe once I master this DVD I can find a more intermediate DVD.

If you're one of those stuck-up yoga people at the gym, this DVD will be too easy for you. Spend your money on another Vinyassa Yoga class.

If you're new to Yoga and want the benefits of Yoga without the stuck-up Yoga people, get this DVD.",1241654400,29,531,4.145631067961165
3726748,5,B001O4C6IA,i love yoga and i have all of the Hemalayaa DVDs which i highly recommend along with this one. i am looking for beginner yoga that aren't a long workout. a few years back i got out of yoga and have been trying to get back into it due to a very stressful job and the threatening high blood pressure readings and chidings of my doctor mother and various friends. i preordered this and waited while i went through injuries falling down 4 stairs and dealing with an impossible set of co-workers that drive my blood pressure up and just this week antibiotics and a sinus infection. so when i get the mail today and i get this DVD i think i'll just watch it maybe meditatate a little if she has a relaxation section. she does. i got to tell you its 2 workouts 20 minutes each and they are just what the paragraph says- relaxing centering i feel better calmer and i'm smiling because i had fun. i finished the first and only due to time constraints i reluctantly ended the second ten minutes in. These yoga positions are really on the easier side if you have concerns about past injuries and definately good for somebody starting back in again like me. for those of you who are serious about your yoga this workout is FUN and shows creativity to its producers taking a new look at yoga. i will put this on my do first list.  Highly Highly recommend.,1239148800,14,1342,4.325396825396825
3726767,5,B001O4C6IA,A very relaxing yoga stretch.  Her voice is so soothing.,1407196800,,56,4.6
3726768,4,B001O4C6IA,"The video is great. But the two 20-minute sessions don't have enough differentiating them, so why did I pay twice as much?
Hemalayaa is very positive and that makes the yoga fun. She is the reason I bought the video. Enjoy her Bollywood Dance Workout, and this also has that fluidity of movement and femininity I expected. The yoga is VERY basic, but it also gives a whole body stretch. I mean, how much yoga can you fit into 20 minutes?",1406678400,,437,4.407407407407407
3726769,5,B001O4C6IA,"As a person who has a hard time with yoga, I love these workouts. They're shorter than your average yoga class, and they're fun. It's a great pace for someone who isn't super familiar with yoga- not so fast that you can't keep up or get a good stretch, but not so slow that you get bored. Hemalayaa is a little silly, but it's fun.",1404691200,,331,4.107692307692307
3726770,5,B001O4C6IA,"This yoga DVD is amazing for beginners of yoga. I wouldn't suggest it for people who have more than a year experience though, although I still use it on days when I need off time and don't want to do anything too hard. Both these workouts are very slow and gentle but still has a lot of stretching and some good strengthening poses. The set is beautiful and relaxing, and Hemalayaa explains  the movements very well. There are two routines on the disc, I like the first routine better than the second but they are both good. I would recommend this for beginners of yoga and for people who want to improve their flexibility or just really want to relax the mind!",1403481600,,661,4.418032786885246
3726771,5,B001O4C6IA,"love Hemalayaa! she's so talented and amazing. great yoga practice for intermediate yogi, i really enjoy her DVDs! she gives clear instructions, music is great.",1399161600,,160,5.44
3726772,5,B001O4C6IA,"I love Hemalayaa, and this DVD is fun, easy, relaxing... It has a great mix of techniques, and Hemalayaa's attitude is so positive and uplifting. I think this DVD would be a great place to start if you are new to yoga or need to get back into an exercise routine. It is not overly challenging, but is refreshing and fun.",1392163200,,320,4.262295081967213
3726773,5,B001O4C6IA,"I LOVE Hemalayaa's approach to yoga.  I am male, and a yoga beginner.  This video is perfect for people like me it's not so simple that it gets old and uninteresting in a short time, and it's not so challenging that it demotivated me from trying.

It's especially nice to learn/fail/look a little goofy and out of shape free from embarrassment in the comfort of my own home.  Taking an actual yoga class next month.  Wouldn't be able to do that without Hemalayaa's Yoga for Everyone.",1386633600,,483,4.569767441860465
3726774,5,B001O4C6IA,"I love this DVD
The actual movements are easy for everyone, but she has created a nice fun time.

Many yoga instructor seems too serious to me, but she looks very happy and that tells me she really loves Yoga.
I like this feeling.

This is great DVD for beginners.",1384041600,,264,4.26
3726775,5,B001O4C6IA,"Great video!  Well made.  Very relaxing.  Each session is different and easy.  If you are a beginner and you want two workouts, to keep it interesting, this is a good start.",1364169600,,173,4.483870967741935
3726776,5,B001O4C6IA,"I like these simple bends and stretches. It's not hard to do but I always leave feeling stretched and content... awesome!  This is in two 20 min. segments.  I like to do one 20 min. segment, then to Jackie Warner's 40 min. power circuit with weights, then finish with the other 20 min. segment of Hemalayaa's Yoga. That's a perfect world, sometimes I can only squeeze in one 20 min. segment then back to reality. It's nice. My first copy was eaten alive by my old dvd player. I reorderd this as I was asking my husband to head to town for a new dvd player. So, this just may be on my ""stranded on a desert island with electricty, wifi, dvd player and  tablet  list""",1361404800,,665,4.253968253968254
3726777,5,B001O4C6IA,"This video was my first experience with yoga, and like most of the Hemalayaa videos, I fell in love with it immediately.  The two segments are fun but relaxing and leave you feeling great.  I enjoy doing just one at a time and alternating each time I excercise.  For me, doing both on the same day is a bit tedious and doing one twenty minute segment is the perfect amount.  I am an absolute yoga beginner, and I found this to be a very accessible workout.  If you are looking for the cardio workout that is in most of her videos, you will not find it here.  This is strictly a yoga video.",1340668800,,589,4.168141592920354
3726778,2,B001O4C6IA,"I usually love everything Hemalayaa does and was excited to see she was doing a yoga video even if it was for the beginner. I've been doing Yoga for six months and thought I could use this video but it was just totally lacking. It's VERY light stretching but Hemalayaa puts her personal touch on it and includes some of the most basic yoga poses. I was disappointed and glad I rented it first, even if your a beginner pass on this one.",1339977600,2,435,4.253012048192771
3726779,4,B001O4C6IA,"It's not Hemalayaa's best DVD, I like her Bollywood workouts better. But she is charming, and it's a good one.",1335916800,,110,4.55
3726780,3,B001O4C6IA,This was more advanced than we expected. If you are well acquainted with yoga this is probably okay.  The sessions begin and take off with little instruction.  Perhaps when we are better it will be more suitable for us.,1322265600,,219,4.589743589743589
3726781,5,B001O4C6IA,"The instruction is easy to understand and the instructor gives soothing guidance for all the poses and breaths.  It was very relaxing segments,",1310860800,,143,5.217391304347826
3726782,5,B001O4C6IA,"Get this DVD! I purchased ""Yoga For Everyone"" at a Half Price Book Store and I can truly say that this is the type of Yoga DVD's that I'm seeking. Hemalayaa stretches and relaxes you as well as includes meditation. The background with the sheer white curtains and candles is so relaxing, it makes you smile! Hemalayaa's bubbly spirit transforms through my t.v. I have to warn you about the stick out the tongue on the exhales with certain poses, it's weird at first, but once you get use to it, it actually purges your tension! After doing the DVD, I felt so happy and relaxed! Money well spent, and I agree that This IS Yoga for EVERYONE!

update: 06/29/2011. I've been having sore knees, and I'm 95% sure it's because of this Yoga Video. Be careful with this video because she does quite a few lunges. Which I think is the culprit!

3726783,5,B001O4C6IA,"I have practiced yoga on and off for the past year so, it is safe to say that I am a beginner and  not hard core. I do several other types of dance fitness workouts in which some of them leave me quite stiff and sore afterwards. This dvd is the perfect routine to do after the cardio/toning sessions. It completely loosened me up and relieved the soreness in my muscles and joints. And, to my surprise it even relieved the tendonitis flare-ups I sometimes get with the faster paced aerobic routines. I love all the stretching. It feels so good! It should be called 'Healing Yoga'. This one is a definite keeper!",1305244800,,611,4.407079646017699
3726784,5,B001O4C6IA,"I have done yoga off and on for nearly 15 years, and have gone through a lot of life changes that have made it difficult for me to practice consistently. I ended up taking a few years off from doing yoga, and getting back into it has been daunting. I'm not fit enough to go through a whole 90 minute class, and I work long days that make it tough to fit in exercise.

This DVD is perfect for getting me to practice regularly. I won't lie, the beautiful production value, the soft lighting, and Hemalayaa's gentle voice make this a pleasurable dvd to come home to. The practice itself is very limbering, and has just the right level of athletic demand. It's not exhausting or difficult, but you get to work your arms and your quads a bit, and for regaining flexibility and muscle strength, it's just right. Beginners would like this too, to ease into learning some very basic poses. Each session is 20 minutes, so it's easy to fit into a busy schedule.",1299628800,2,951,4.403409090909091
3726785,4,B001O4C6IA,"I just started doing yoga over the last three months, and have taken lots of classes from several very serious instructors.  I decided to purchase a few DVDs for convenience to do at home.  I must say I am very pleased and surprised by this particular DVD; it has such a happy, free, and unintimidating feel to it.  I'm laughing and doing a lot more unconventional fluid movements than I do with my serious classes and it just feels joyful!  I highly recommend to shake up your usual routine.  Thanks Hema!!!",1274659200,4,508,4.538461538461538
3726786,5,B001O4C6IA,"This workout DVD satisfied me, not because I am a beginner, but it's fun and pleasant to do. I didn't have to struggle with lunges because Hemalayaa has her knees down, I didn't get vertigo because you slowly and briefly hold a position. There are 2 workouts at 20 minutes each. As usual in her DVDs, there's her voiceover and a quiet, subtle percussion background music. The stage is decorated with candles, pillows, and flowy sheer curtains. The choreography transitions from the sitting cross-legged on the floor with a brief chant, then standing and ends on the floor lying on a bolster (rolled up blankets). The unique qualities of this workout is the movement in the positions-you're either swaying, shaking, pulsing, rotating wrists. There are also facial movements (stick out your tongue) and bursts of exhalation. Satisfied workout that I will use many times in the future.",1270944000,5,882,5.006802721088436

The moves she uses are cat cow, down dog, up dog, lunges, tree pose among other.

This is a great video if you are a beginner at yoga. It will take some work to coordinate all the moves with the proper breathing techniques.",1436918400,3,399,4.2368421052631575

8329274,1,B001O4C6IA,"This woman spews ignorant and arrogant trash about people suffering from clinical depression on her blog. Specifically, she refers to anyone who is medicated for depression as a person ""who just pops a happy pill"", insinuating that these people aren't ill, and have to take medication to thrive, let alone survive. She clearly states on her blog that she thinks she's better than those who HAVE to take antidepressents, saying that she would ""rather take the high road"", and ""put in the work"" to ""get happy"".

Further, with NO MEDICAL DEGREE WHATSOEVER, she offers to ""cure"" you of those awful antidepressents for a ""small fee"". (Some quick research revealed that ""small fee"" to be almost $300)
