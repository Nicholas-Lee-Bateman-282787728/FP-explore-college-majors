8693768,5,B00R1ZZD04,"One of the true forms of Japanese Kenjutsu left, without western commercialism and marketing.

Declared a living cultural heritage by the Japanese Government.

Recommended for the true practitioner.",1484697600,,198,6.035714285714286
8693769,1,B00R1ZZD04,Interesting subject shown in the most boring way possible.,1481500800,,58,5.555555555555555
8693770,3,B00R1ZZD04,"Thought this was going to be a great way to show my students this way of life, but it was not attention grabbing enough.",1467417600,,120,4.041666666666667
8693771,2,B00R1ZZD04,"I expected the film to be about either the philosophy behind the art or explanations/demos of specific techniques, but it seemed to be more of a discussion of the lineage of the art and, to me, opaque recordings of various students & masters performing a form or two.  Context for the katas was missing, rendering their movements incomprehensible.  Not for me.",1465948800,,360,4.885245901639344

8693773,5,B00R1ZZD04,very good dvd on a not so well know  school....although the new proponents (the old soke passed in 2013) say the sogo bujutsu that once was is all but lost and now only kenjutsu remains....is understandable as many do not want to cause stir in this area. neither hi ranking masters seemed to want that...but some how i got the feeling  there is more to learn here if truly trained with them which is also claimed by a european student elsewhere... either way the old soke was just plain and simple badass even at a old age. i appreciate all i was shown when i got the chance the first time i understood going to a demo and maybe  learning a few waza did not make you a student or allow you to say you were. great piece.,1426636800,,719,4.195652173913044
