5693914,5,B00C7C02KC,"""Frances Ha"" is Noah Baumbach's most mature film to date, a remarkably understated film that both captivates and inspires.

Frances is a 27-year old dancer whose weird and messy life becomes unbearable when Sophie, her best friend since college and her anchor, moves out and becomes engaged to a Goldman Sachs banker.  Frances is desperately in love with Sophie, in large part because Sophie is so much like her without actually being her.

Like most Noah Baumbach films, nothing really much happens and there's no real plot.  But the film is surprisingly swift.  Frances' frenetic wandering -- from a Chinatown apartment to Sacramento to see her parents to Paris to just escape New York and then back to her collegetown for a summer -- does help to give the film movement, but what captivates the audience is the fast, witty dialogue and Greta Gerwig's all too real portrayal of a weird, awkward, and flaky grown-up little girl who just doesn't know how to take care of herself.",1372636800,5,979,4.838323353293413
5693915,4,B00C7C02KC,"I've seen several of Noah Baumbach's films as well as those of his girlfriend and star in this film Greta Gerwig.  I've always found Gerwig's characters to be a bit odd but still very likable.  This is her best film yet.

She plays Frances, a 28 year old understudy at a small New York ballet company.  She's not very good, but she doesn't know it.  Her best friend and roommate, Sophie (Sting's daughter Mickey Sumner) have an unusual friendship but Sophie decides to move in with her boyfriend (Michael Esper).  This leaves Sophie in a bit of a lurch as their lease is up for renewal.  She temporarily moves in with a couple dudes (Adam Driver and Michael Zegen) who are friends of a friend.  Eventually she loses her position in the ballet because of financial cutbacks.

As Frances sputters away from her dream of being a dancer and yes, finding a guy - friends joke she's undatable - she finds refuge with her parents played by Gerwig's real parents.  She then moves on to her alma mater in upstate New York to do some meager jobs, but gets room and board.  At times you want to yell at Frances to get it together, but then you realize that is what she's trying to do.  The film is mix of Lena Dunham's ""Girls"" with a little Whit Stillman and a lot of Woody Allen, including the use of black and white filming.  Good flick.",1371600000,2,1328,4.39344262295082

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 Noah Baumbach co-wrote 'Frances Ha' with his current significant other, Greta Gerwig, the actress who plays the title role. It's Baumbach's take on a 27 year old aspiring dancer/choreographer who just can't seem to get herself together. Slate Magazine's Dane Stevens describes Frances as ""childlike and disorganized."" Stephen Holden of The Times has an even more prescient descriptor, describing Frances as one who operates under a sense of ""entitlement."" The film is shot in black and white and it reminds me of the 1962 French New Wave flick, 'Cleo from 5 to 7'. While 'Frances' is not filmed in real time like 'Cleo', it has the same feel: expansive shots of the care-free, largely self-absorbed protagonist, who prances about, highlighted by one urban backdrop after another. Baumbach clearly wants us to link his film to the spirit of the French New Wave, as he employs the famed French film composer, Georges Delerue, to provide much of the film's soundtrack.

When we first meet Frances, she's living in a Brooklyn apartment with her best friend, Sophie, who recites 'The Story of Us'--a whimsical tale of the two young women engaging in a ""world takeover"". However, as we break into Act II, Frances feels betrayed, when Sophie announces she's moving to a new apartment share which Frances can't possibly afford (Frances is an intern at a small dance company).

Frances briefly resides with two younger guys, one of whom classifies her as ""undateable"". Frances often drinks too much and makes inappropriate comments in various social situations. Frances eventually travels to Sacramento to visit her parents and later, takes a particularly ill-advised trip to Paris, funded by a credit-card. All of this proves quite repetitious as Dana Stevens remarks in Slate: ""There are too many scenes in a row that make the same point--Frances is a creative but lovable flake who's her own worst enemy."" Just like in Cleo from 5 to 7, the protagonist's journey is not as important as allowing the viewer to take in the wonderful ambiance and atmosphere. Baumbach indeed is a virtuoso when it comes to highlighting Frances' myopia through visual (non-dialogue) scenes.

Frances finally ends up as an RA at summer dance camp at Vassar College where she runs into now-married Sophie, who's flown in with her straight-arrow husband, who's now working in Japan. Sophie hates being in Japan and is unhappy in her marriage. Perhaps here Baumbach is foreshadowing Frances' eventual triumph: the struggling artist trumps those who opt for more traditional pathways (while Sophie seemingly is Frances' social better, Baumbach makes it clear, that's not the way it ends up).

I can't help bring 'Cleo from 5 to 7' up again. Just like Frances, 'Cleo' goes from complete self-absorption to liberation. In Cleo's case, a sweet-talking soldier and an oncologists' positive diagnosis, bring her back to reality and happiness. In Frances' case, it's not really clear what got her to change her attitude after all the self-defeating, myopic behavior. By accepting the job at the dance company and then establishing her own clientle of students (creating her own dance school), Frances suddenly finds redemption.

'Frances Ha' has some sharp performances, particularly Ms. Gerwig in the title role along with Mickey Sumner as Sophie. Mr. Baumbach's visual style and direction is a worthy throwback to the French New Wave era. Nonetheless, some may find the non-conformist Frances' machinations to be too one-note and grating throughout most of the film. Baumbach is more forgiving and suggests that Frances' late maturity is normal and part and parcel of normal young adult development.",1370995200,13,3730,5.143564356435643

She breaks up with her boyfriend, her relationship with her best friend becomes strained, and she has trouble getting a job at a dance studio. Greta Gerwig, who is good in these types of quirky, funny roles, is perfectly cast as Frances. This appears to be a realistic look at the life of one woman who lives in a big city, and is trying to find her way through life. This one is a nice effort.",1370822400,3,512,4.13
5693918,3,B00C7C02KC,"Okay, first of all, let me concede that Greta Gerwig is a talented young lady. She writes and acts, she works all the time and she should play Chlo Sevigny's sister in the near future. They definitely look related!

Now let me tell you about this 2013 Seattle International Film Festival entry from the USA. One of my most fundamental requirements for a movie is that I want someone to root for. No such luck in this one! Here we have an annoying young woman who seems fixated on another young woman but they fight all the time when they are roommates. She pretends to be a dancer but can't dance, pleads poverty even though her parents seem to be supporting her, and generally upsets everyone who meets her.

We have:
  * Greta Gerwig (""Lola Versus"") is Frances, needy, clinging, mendacious, selfish and manipulative. She is tone deaf to the folks around her; oblivious to how they react to her boring conversations; spends (her parents') money like it is water; and doesn't understand why life isn't treating her well.
  * Mickey Sumner (""Girl Most Likely"") is Sophie, her erstwhile best friend who really doesn't like her anymore.
  * Adam Driver (""Lincoln"") is Lev, who directs her on the best way to leave his apartment, but she moves in anyway, with him and his roommate (she rarely pays rent).
  * Michael Zengen (Lots of TV) is Benji, the roommate who accommodates our unpleasant heroine when she is without a place to stay.

Our screening audience just shook our collective head when we exited the theater. Even though this R-rated black and white flick was a great favorite at Sundance, it won't win any prizes for Director Noah Baumbach in MY book! Amazon will notify me when this is available; although I'm not sure I want my own copy, some of my JayFlix.net people might.",1370649600,4,1784,4.667731629392971
5693919,5,B00C7C02KC,"""Frances Ha"" (2013 release; 86 min.) brings the story of Frances (played by Greta Gerwig), a 27 yr. woman living in New York with an iffy job in a dance company. As the movie opens we see Frances spending time with her best friend Sophie (played by Mickey Sumner, a/k/a the daughter of Sting). When Frances' boyfriend asks her to move in with him, she refuses, saying she cannot get out of her lease (but in reality simply wanting to stay with Sophie). The boyfriend breaks up with her. Shortly thereafter Sophie surprises Frances when she wants to movie out to her dream apartment in Tribeca (""I'm not leaving you! I'm just moving neighborhoods!""). This starts a series of events that seemingly puts Frances in a downward spiral. To tell you much more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is an out-of-the-park homerun for director Noah Baumbach (previous efforts include The Squid and the Whale, Margot At the Wedding, and Greenberg) and Greta Gerwig, who has a nice string of movies going, including last year's delightful Lola Versus. Baumbach and Gerwig met on the set of Greenberg, and co-wrote ""Frances Ha"". The movie is charming from start to finish, yet never gets silly or sentimental. It's a slice of life as experienced by this young woman with big dreams and little or no money. The movie is filmed in delicious black and white, which of course immediately invites a comparison to Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"", which covers a lot of the same territory and in the same city. And guess what: ""Frances Ha"" stands up very nicely to the Woody Allen classic. ""Frances Ha"" places two songs with great effect, David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" as Frances runs through the streets of New York, and even better, Hot Chocolate's ""Every 1's a Winner"", playing as Frances has a disastrous trip to Paris. Just great! Lastly, if you are wondering where the movie's title comes from, all will be revealed in the very last scene of the movie. This movie is billed as a ""dramatic comedy"" and I'm not sure what that really means. Yes there are a lot of funny scenes in it, but not the kind that make you laugh-out-loud, but instead make you chuckle with inside joy.

Bottom line, as I watched this movie today, I sensed that times was flying by and I so wished that the movie wouldn't end quite yet, as I loved ""hanging out"" with Frances and her friends. I am trying to find flaws in this movie, but honestly cannot come up with any. In Hollywood terms, this movie was made for a nickle and a dime, but no matter: for me this is the best movie of the year so far, and I see a LOT of movies. I am happy to say that the screening at the art-house theatre here in Cincinnati today was very well attended (and it's playing on two screens no less, a rarity at this theatre), so quality may overcome after all. If you are in the mood for a top notch movie that does not involve mega-explosions or saving the world, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Frances Ha"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1369958400,39,3089,4.553956834532374

Frances is a lovely, huge-hearted yet sardoncially honest creature and character who meanders through her life.

5693939,5,B00C7C02KC,"I always thought a critic wasn't qualified to criticize unless he or she could create something better. I cant do better than this film, and Ive yet to see a critic who can.

I first heard about Frances Ha in a passing conversation after the films premiere in 2012. I ignored the suggestion to see it. I asked myself why I would want to watch a chick flick about an Eurasian woman adjusting to life in America?

 Because its not about that is the short answer.  I had judged the film by its title.

In the opening sequence, two young women are play fighting on the streets of Brooklyn, New York. It looks kind of silly, which it is. But thats how Frances (Greta Gerwig) first appears, along with Sophie (Mickey Sumner) her best friend forever. I hesitate to use the bff moniker because its too generic.  These two talented goofball women seriously love each other.

Like a long married couple Frances says, without the sex.

You can see and feel the intimacy between them the first time you lay eyes on them. The movie has a  level of emotional engagement that sweeps you up. Its fast paced. The images come at you furiously in quick takes. At first, Its like shorthand in film, a black and white sketch of New York City. It slows sometimes, such as when Frances goes home to Sacramento for the holidays.
Thats for contrast: California suburbia with its cookie-cutter houses  vs. Brooklyn, with it gray  neighborhoods, apartments with marginally affordable rents. The style of living in New York brings people together and also pulls them apart.

 This is real challenge for the young starter people who wish to livein New York City. Only the wealthy can afford to live in glamorous Manhattan, the New York City that visitors imagine -- forgetting the four other boroughs where people live and struggle.  Among a population of more than eight million people, connections matter. If Manhattan is an island, then so are the people either living or lost in it.  Your universe is your friends. Everything else  is unfriendly territory.

Frances and Sophie live together with Sophie complaining about Frances sloppy habits.  But like all New Yorkers, they dream.  Frances dreams of becoming more than an apprentice at the dance company she works for, usually without pay.  Shes that free-spirited 27 year old woman you see enjoying her young body while doing ballet leaps along the streets.

Its not so cutesy as it sounds. Frances alternates between feline gracefulness and an endearing awkward klutziness.  Running down a crowded street to find an ATM to pay for dinner with a self-centered New York hipster, she stumbles, falls, skins her elbows.  Thats how she ends up living with another New York couple, Benji and Lev.

These two are the quintessential New York b.s. artists, never in short supply.  Lev has wealthy connections so he can pass himself off as a successful toff. The more likeable Benji presents himself as a comedy writer but his successes are largely imaginary.  The three are temporarily thrust together because Frances finds herself with no place to live.

Lev is a little blind-sided when he discovers Frances has only $900 of the $1200 needed to pay her share of the $3600 monthly rent.  What? Only $43,000 a year to live in lower Manhattan? Must be a rent-controlled apartment right? Things get worse for Frances when she doesnt get into Christmas show which would have provided her with much needed funds.

Home-girl Sophie has fallen in love with Patch  a handsome financial executive type.  Frances finds out the hard way,  on a clattering subway ride where Sophie is busily texting, that her life is going to drastically change.

Things go steadily south for Frances while Sophie seems to have grabbed the brass ring.  Sophie moves to Japan with her wealthy fiance and develops a dishonest blog showing all the great things she into.  She explains to Frances later that its only for her mom, that she really misses New York, and Frances.

Director Noah Baumbach really has this stuff down. Hes produced a fine indie film with none of the exaggerated hysterics or quasi-literary pretentions that keep a certain type of movie-goer away from art films.  You know the type  the ones who think Frances Ha is a young Chinese woman suffering culture shock.

 I was impressed, too, that Greta Gerwig teamed up with Baumbach to write the script, as she has done on other projects.  Gerwig demonstrated an exceptional talent in portraying a character with broad emotional range.  Gerwigs Frances Ha is as free-flowing as a mountain stream.  Her mercurial facial expressions are more about sincerity than naivete. No buried emotions there, but no schmaltzy, cloying, sickeningly sweet appeals to loser boyfriend either. She ditches Dan and announces her availability to the meat market without missing a stitch. On the same day, Sophie reminds her. But its neither about romance or sex  its about a niche, a slice of New York life.

Lest you think this is a drab woe-is-me movie about a struggling dancer, I add that its sense of humor is prevalent throughout.  The New York style locations might have magnified some of the fun, but the same things happen in Peoria, Illinois or Minot, North Dakota.
Youre about to hit the 30s milestone. Your friends are going up in the world while you are going down. You haven't been the great success you promised your parents.  Youve opted for the creative life but find yourself bypassed. You have a heart condition that won't allow you to sell yourself out. People you meet have romantic little pied-a-terre in Paris and, in the kindness of their hearts, they let you stay there on a weekend so you can feel important too.

Buts its all a big fumble for Frances.  Her only job prospect is to return to the university she graduated from where shes guaranteed a dormitory place to live.  In return, she becomes a pourer for university homecoming and fund-raising events. Yes, shes assigned a distinguished alumnus to follow around wth a wine bottle.  Embarrassing. Humiliating. Undateable, as shes been told countless times by Benji.
And what is your worst nightmare? While enduring this insufferable decline of prospects, your best friend in the world Sophie has come back to the university with her wealthy husband. Sophies own unhappiness comes front and center in her reunion with Frances. Its also vomited up from her guts when she gets blinding drunk at the social meetup.  Mickey Sumner as Sophie was spectacular in her role of the one friend in the world that you cant do without.

Frances Ha is widely praised by critics but has its detractors. Some of the detractors  say that the images and language come at you too fast. Others resent the New York focus. Theres a remedy for that, Im thinking.  Just put the film in slow motion.  But definitely you should rent it if you haven't seen Frances Ha.  You won't be sorry if youve got a sentient nerve left in your aging body.
And about the Chinese girl Frances Ha?  You know those doorbell and mailbox panels that have the names of the fifty-four apartment dwellers who live there?  Frances couldn't fit her whole name in there, she had to cut off the six letters at the end. Frances Halladay.",1478044800,,7203,4.799512987012987

This honesty of hers brings life to the roles she plays.  Frances Ha works mostly because of her (she has a lot of screen time, too).  I can't think of any other young actor who could play this woman/child role.

The story is basically a transition of life stages.  People in their late 20s to late 30s are becoming couples, married, or parents.  They put more attention on career and finance (if you have children, it's necessary).  Frances was a late bloomer.  After her best friend fades out of her life, she tries to regain her footing.

The black and white background is terrific.  All the character interactions were shot in close range.  The non color brought out the emotional undercurrent in a pronounced way.

The music works well the the story, too.  The banjo solo in the beginning with the montage of Sophie and Frances gave me a singular joy in its emotional purity.  No wonder Frances was very content to be with Sophie.  There's an emotional harmony and child-at-heartness that's endearing.  The song ""Modern Love"" accompanying France when she was jogging along the street of NYC was so fitting.  The joy of being young and living in NYC was represented in this montage.

Noah Baumbachs film is all of these things and none of these things; from the use of music from The 400 Blows to the locations that film was shot in (ranging from New York City to Paris), the film wears its inspirations on its sleeves, but it breathes new life into what could have been a clichd story of a young woman finding herself in a big city. Of course, the city is New York and that woman is played by Greta Gerwig (who co-wrote the film with Baumbach); in Gerwig's and Baumbach's hands, nothing feels derivative or generic. The screenwriting is sharp and brilliant, Gerwigs performance may be her very best yet, and Sam Levys cinematography is beautiful. Like Gordon Willis work in Woody Allen's Manhattan, the black and white cinematography here never feels gimmicky or pretentious and is always breathtaking. Then again, the same could be said about the entire film.",1421798400,,1040,4.783333333333333

I would watch it again, and wish I was young and thought I could make a career as an opera singer, and hang out with my fellow musicians and dancers.  And, some of us did make it.  But, not all of us.

5694046,5,B00C7C02KC,"Frances Ha is superb! It now takes the place in my heart reserved for some of my favorite films of all time. Why?
I collect films like many on here and also specifically Criterion Blu-rays, I've been collecting Criterion films since the Laserdisc days in the 80's and 90's so always give a film released on Criterion a chance. I also typically rent the videos from my library system before plunging down the money to own it. Read all the review from Blu-ray.com and Hi Def Digest about the quality of the transfer and so on...
I don't buy every Criterion but those I feel are wonderful enough to own and I fell completely in love with Frances. I enjoy these types of films and I put Frances Ha in the same category as Whit Stillman's Metropolitan and Barcelona with Last Days of Disco being my favorite of his. Also I put Frances Ha up against any Woody Allen film as well... and in my personal point of view Frances out does Manhattan in it's real-world-tone about people who struggle with not only career choices but relationships. In essence people who live in New York City and who are lost to a great degree on how to proceed through life after college...
I found Frances Ha witty, poignant, funny, non-contrived and real. Frances as a character is completely relatable - fun, sad and quirky just like most people are in real life. And as with most people she struggles with the everydayness of life and unsatisfied with her job or trying to make it up the ladder of success in her chosen profession.
These are issues we can ALL relate to unless you happen to be a manic A-type personality who achieves every single goal you set in your life.
I am an artist by profession so I know all too well the ups and down associated with trying to achieve a prosperous career in the arts like Frances does at wanting to be a dancer.
I've seen success and failure both - the mundaneness of everyday existence between gigs - living on hopes and dreams and not always having enough money ... as well as sudden influxes of cash that breathe that much needed life-blood into a certain year of your life... as Frances gets from a Tax-Refund at one point in the film.
I love that this is in Black and White too - the starkness of reality verses the dream quality that color can emote.
This is frankness, probably the most entertaining and ""true"" film there is outside of a documentary or a biographical film.
In all it's shades and moods, character ups and downs, being lost or feeling found as they do. To me Frances Ha IS art in every sense of the word and totally relatable. Frances Ha is an experience that enwraps you - you will it's characters and get soaked into their lives ... let wash over you like a cold shower or a warm bath because it is both, sink in and enjoy Frances and her world - because it's our world too...",1408579200,,2817,4.408829174664107

they only produce editions of films they feel will meet the test of time and remain in film
history, for some reason or another.  And they always produce the very best edition of the

by an aficionado of the material, explaining why and how it is significant).

I've watched a couple of movies in my days which I thought were TERRIBLE--only to find
that for some reason, they stuck in my head decades later--and then saw them released on

have thought it terrible, NOT thought about it a decade later, and still not found it very
compelling in the Criterion Collection edition, either!  It seems to suffer from
""referentialitis""--that is, it's a movie for film critics more than for normal film viewers.

In this brilliant film, Frances Ha, I have imagined this type of friendship in my mind, dreamed about it, fantasized about it but I could never find an illustration of my idea of genuine friendship that is outside of my head--until now!

The film, Frances Ha, centers on two female BFFs. Strong female relationships are rarely featured in film and even more seldom are they accurately portrayed. This film showcases a very honest female friendship, free of love triangles and cattiness. Also in the film, the female relationship changes, but, like in real friendships, it is important to accept that change is okay. A friendship can evolve, and perhaps lessen in intensity, but it can survive nonetheless. Frances Ha attest to this fact, highlighting the natural maturation of the women involved and how they must learn to accept change in one another. Its cool to be ""different girls with different hair""to survive the natural ebbs and flows of friendship.

So, with this Frances Ha, I have finally found the epitome of my idea of real best friendships.

5694065,3,B00C7C02KC,"FRANCES HA has a straightforward plot: our eponymous hero (Greta Gerwig) aspires to become a dancer yet finds herself perpetually thwarted by circumstances.  Unable to find a steady boyfriend, she takes pleasure in sustaining a platonic friendship with Sophie (Mickey Sumner), who fails to reciprocate, despite numerous protestations of love.  Frances drifts through life, taking a succession of dead-end jobs and living with different people (she even returns to her parents in California), until she is given the opportunity to choreograph a dance of her own, through which she discovers fulfillment at last.  Shot on a shoestring in black-and-white, Noah Baumbach's film has a free-wheeling spirit reminiscent of mid-1960s British films: despite her reversals, Frances sustains her basic optimism as she roams the streets of New York.  Her joie-de-vivre contrasts with Sophie's more mundane existence - although more successful in career terms, Sophie ends up in a relationship with Patch (Patrick Heusinger) that condemns her to a life of disappointment.  The only problem with FRANCES HA is that it ends up being slightly manipulative: Baumbach piles on Frances' agonies (even sending her to Paris for a disastrous weekend) without exploring her character in any great depth.  We know little about her, other than the fact that she is determined to sustain her dreams at any cost.  As a result, the feelgood ending seems a little artificial: we have little or no idea what Frances will do in the future.

I heard great things about this movie when it was out in theaters but didn't make it out to see it, so I was excited when I saw it available for streaming. Unfortunately, I found it painful to get through. Frances lives a life of a combination of cringe-inducing choices, awkward dialogue, and bad luck, which you see play out in various ways throughout the film. She also lacks talent as a dancer, which is also made apparent, even though she has so much enthusiasm for dancing. I found it hard to get through the movie, although I'm not sure why exactly. Greta Gerwig is a good actress and plays the part convincingly, and I wanted to see what would happen, so I watched the whole thing.

Although I didn't enjoy much of the movie leading up to the end, the end was the worst part to me. It was a very happy ending that felt completely unearned. She goes from a total mess of a person that we see portrayed in excruciating detail until around the last five minutes of the movie, and then she moves to Washington Heights and is suddenly shown putting on a successful dance performance that she choreographed, and that all of her friends attend even though they spent much of the movie blowing her off, and her life is now apparently awesome. I would've liked to see more about how she arrived at that point from the continuous low she'd been at before. It just feels like the ending was tacked on to make the movie seem less miserable in the end, but to me it didn't fit with the rest of it.",1394496000,7,1527,4.392226148409894

This is movie about Frances  Greta Gerwig) who does not have a job or a boyfriend. She wants to be a dancer but does not  have the talent to be one. She is out of touch with modernity ( Calls a smartphone the phone with mail on it) but dotes on Sophie, her best friend and confidant -  she describes this friendship as the lesbian couple who does not have sex. Lurching through life, she is surprised that Sophie has started dating a boy and wants to move out, thus Frances moves in with two guys to seek company and also some help with the rent.

Greta Gerwig easily turns in one of the years best performance and is simply brilliant. I loved her facial expressions in almost every scene but the scene where she says goodbye to her parents at the airport -Just outstanding.
Depending on your taste, you might either like or hate this movie as basically it is the story of Frances and how she comes to find her inner self and make peace with her life. The director Noah Baumbach co wrote this film with Gerwig and they have made a fine film, I normally do not like to watch black and white films but this one was just brilliant.

5694087,5,B00C7C02KC,"I'll be honest. I was never a Noah Baumbach fan. The Squid and the Whale was over-rated to me, and, while solid, that previous Baumbach effort -- let's not forget NB has co-written some solid fare with Wes Anderson -- had the critics loving it because it had enough dark material, enough easy cynicism to satisfy the jaded mass of ex-English majors filling the dying papers. FRANCES HA, on the other hand, is FRESH, bright, fun and serious in an entirely different way. We see this young girl's friendship with her ex-college gal pal (""the other her/me"") fall apart and alter as life comes along, with careers and disparate levels of success. The roomie has a relationship. The roomie has a great job. And Frances has to find her way, in that unforgiving career: dance/choreography. And let me tell you, having met the fallen bodies from Julliard and the Manhattan School of Music and watching them adjust to the rigors of this less than forgiving world is something I know well, but this film has a charm, an aplomb, a simple, lovely cadence that gives and gives. Seeing her switch roommates, return to her college roots, suffer the worst kind of ""I can do it"" world travel to Paris, and then land on her feet, without all the cliches of ""Hey, everything is sudden success; she is a choreographer for SNL now'"" is a thing of beauty. I loathe the fact that this upbeat work is not Oscar-nominated. And sure, thinking of The Prof in The Squid and the Whale, yes, I know Oscars are for Philistines :) But, honestly, from twirling to Bowie's ""Modern Love"" in Manhattan to 'fake-fighting,' I LOVED every moment. It does have a formlessness at first, and then you see that it's more than slice of life; it's life rendered damned well, and France's transitions are heroic. There are so many sweet moments, such as her brief visit home at the holidays, rendered in a series of quick cuts and warm images. Gerwig is great. The cinematography: majestic.

Noah Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" has the freeform charm and exuberance of all those independent American and European films from the late 1950s and '60s about unfettered youth finding their way in the world. The comparison is made most striking by the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography that Sam Levy has provided for the film.

Caught in that awkward period where one has not completely shrugged off the dependency of childhood yet not quite attained the full independence of adulthood, Frances is a 27-year-old dancer who's just a little too gangly, a little too relationship-phobic and a little too broke to feel truly secure about herself and her future. She and her best friend, Sophie, a publisher for Random House, are so close that they frequently refer to themselves jokingly as a single person and as a lesbian couple who never has sex. They share an apartment in Brooklyn - that is until Sophie moves in with another friend in another part of town, leaving Frances to secure lodgings with two fellows, Lev and Benji. There's a touch of ""Jules and Jim"" in the relationship between Frances and the men, a bit of ""Georgy Girl"" in Frances' bouts with insecurity and high-spirited kookiness. And it all feels vaguely Bohemian (Lev is a sculptor and rides motorcycles and Benji is a TV comedy writer) as any tale of young folk living in New York certainly should.

Nothing quite turns out the way Frances wants them to, not her career moves, not her relationships; even an impromptu trip to The City of Lights turns out to be a dud. Rather than admit to little and not-so-little defeats in her life, Francis spins a web of fibs designed to convince others that she's doing just fine, thank you very much. But the defining feature of Frances' life is the growing jealousy she feels towards Sophie's fianc who seems to be taking her best buddy and emotional ""life partner"" away from her.

Yet, all this makes ""Frances Ha"" sound like some heavy-breathing tragedy, when nothing indeed could be further from the truth. It is, in fact, a delightfully droll and fetching comedy that doesn't over-rely on quirkiness as so many low budget independent comedies are won't to do. As written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, the screenplay finds a beautiful balance between poignancy and humor, highbrow wit and lowbrow farce. And as Frances, Gerwig brings to life one of the most purely appealing characters we've come across in quite some time, a flighty free-spirit whose self-consciousness and keen powers of observation keep her at least partially grounded in reality. She's matched in performance by Mickey Sumner as Sophie, Adam Driver as Lev and Michael Zegen as Benji.

Together they and Baumbach have made a film that, though it may look like an art house oddity at first glance, has enough broad appeal to pull it into the mainstream.",1389830400,,2844,4.8921161825726145

5694098,1,B00C7C02KC,"Confronted with the critical praise lavished on ""Frances Ha,"" I cannot help but notice a contradiction. On the one hand, this film is supposed to be ""fresh,"" ""original,"" ""genuine,"" ""authentic,"" etc. On the other hand, it is supposed to call to mind the classic work of Woody Allen and French New Wave. I think this judgement is wrong on both counts.

Indeed, the film forfeits all claims to originality as it desperately tries to rip off Godard's ""Band of Outsiders"" and Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim."" All the predictable ingredients are here: black-and-white film, a soundtrack that recalls Georges Delerue's scores, a heroine that runs through the streets like a modern-day Anna Karina or Jeanne Moreau. Even the famous ""Modern Love"" sequence is a blatant rip-off of ""Mauvais Sang"" by Leos Carax (only made joyless and pathetic). Unfortunately, Baumbach is very very far from being Jean-Luc Godard for the new generation of American hipsters. Godard is a philosophical filmmaker, after all, whereas ""Frances Ha"" is devoid of ideas (in the same way that most hipsters are devoid of ideas). At times, ""Frances Ha"" succeeds in recalling Truffaut at his worst: imagine cute and quirky people doing cute and quirky things all day long without ever saying or doing anything thought-provoking. Then again, Baumbach lacks Truffaut's literary quality or the French filmmaker's impressive knowledge of cultural history.

In the end, what we have here is yet another mediocre, pretentious, and unoriginal American indie movie. Really, it's no better or no worse than hundreds of other mediocre indie films made every single year. What's truly disheartening is that our esteemed critics and ""intellectuals"" hail it as the masterpiece of 2013. As far as basic human psychology goes, I can certainly understand why some aspiring critic living in NYC or LA would identify with characters in ""Frances Ha"". One word of advice: a film does not qualify as a ""masterpiece"" just because it leads you to deeply identify with arty, pretentious, and vapid hipsters on screen. Seriously, even if you happen to dress like Adam Driver or emulate his facial hair, you should curb your enthusiasm and try to be more objective as a critic!

It's just a cinematic equivalent of an Instagram picture featuring some handlebar-mustache-sporting-douche posing at a trendy coffee shop.

We want her to succeed, and we kind of want to be her friend. We even would let her stay on our couch for a couple weeks.

Beyond the obvious themes, there are subtle explorations into the role class and background plays into a budding artist's fate. We see other youth equally immature, yet they seem not to have the struggles she has. We see her struggle with her willingness to do anything to get by, yet the shame she has to carry being behind her peers.

5694121,4,B00C7C02KC,"This is a movie about the kind of people I could never be friends with.

It tells the story of Frances and her best friend, Sophie, two 20-something girls in New York. Frances is kind of dizzy, with the kind of self-attitude that tends to irritate people. Her irritated boyfriend wants her to move in with him, but she declines because she wants to stay with Sophie. Then Sophie moves to another apartment with another friend, and Frances is left to figure out her place in the world alone.

Theres not a whole lot of plot here; its just a series of people who let Frances stay with them for awhile. Its an interesting look at the hipster lifestyle from the point of view of someone who cant quite afford it.

The whole movie is filmed in black-and-white. Combine that with a quirky sensibility and rather unlikable characters, and its kind of like a Jim Jarmusch film. But not as boring, and with prettier people.

I usually don't go for films like this, but this one works - mostly because the character of Frances is so charming and funny and stupid and irritating all at the same time. Actress Greta Gerwig really nails her role. And anyone that didn't go right into their dream job after college can relate to parts of it. While it is about the search for love and responsibility, this movie is more realistic than most of its type  it doesnt pretend that love saves the day or that everyone lives happily ever after. It does say that, with the right timing and a certain level of maturity, people can eventually settle into a life that - if not great - is at least good enough.

That being said, Baumbach's greatest film, and of the great comedic films of the last half century is Kicking and Screaming, which continues to be overlooked partially because it was so early in his career and partially because a terrible Will Ferrell movie of the same name exists.

She beams with life, has great facial expressions and can turn from light and fun to heavy on a dime. However, this movie tries to be too cool for its own good and it thinks it's smarter than it is. The best part, by far, is the beginning when her and Sophie are on a tear. I wish we could have spent more time in the middle of the bliss between these too charismatic best friends. But that's not what the film was about, right? The film was about the loss of this. So, we get lots of scenes - too many - of Frances being unbelievably awkward and of her enduring people being unbelievably cruel to her. I love movies with awkward characters. I also love long slow movies that feature not much more than people wandering around noticing things. But the quirky editing created a wall between us and the action and too many of the scenes were staged poorly. The climactic dinner scene, where Frances rambles, much to the dismay of the other guests, was so ineffectual that it really hurt the overall film. We needed to truly feel the presence of the other people at the table in order to be fully immersed in the scene. But no, they're just props for the Frances-is-awkward show.

Do you want to go to France but have saved it just so you have it saved away forever but know you are never going there?

I don't think Frances Ha is an underachievers bible but I noticed my 20's slip away from me and then one day I just gave up and for some time I let other lives and important cities take over.

Frances Ha is a deliberate film. Even it's title, even the way she wouldn't tell her friends what she's doing, she thinks she is silly, she wishes she could dance a little less awkward, when she wants to pay for the date she wants to pay for the date, she is a much nicer person than every girl we men meet and hate.

5694128,4,B00C7C02KC,"More a character study than plot driven film, it tells of the lost, screwed up 27 year old Francis, played with lost, screwed up loveable-ness by co-writer Greta Gerwig. She has what seems an amazingly close relationship with her roommate and best friend Sophie (a terrific Mickey Summer), but it all comes crashing down when Sophie decides to move out (and maybe grow up) for a better apartment (not as crazy as that sounds in NYC), leaving Frances suddenly uprooted and alone.

We follow Frances as she pin-balls through places to live and people to connect with (or not), seeming too childlike for her own good, and unable to take control of her life. But she never sinks so low that she loses the spark that makes us want good things for her, in spite of her continually getting in her own way.

While the film has some very touching moments, and generally excellent acting and writing, something in it made me feel held a bit at arms length. For all the joy and sorrow in Frances life, I felt more like a clinical observer and less like a participant than I wanted to. And while some of Baumbachs nods to French new wave film-making work wonderfully (the high-spirited musical romp Frances takes down New York streets is wildly infectious), some of them, like the constant use of music from those seminal
1960s films as score was, for me, distracting and too self-conscious. Frances is a good enough character, and Baumbach a talented enough story teller that it the film didn't need such heavy handed style laid over it.

Still, a unique, if flawed film about a unique if flawed character. Its good to see Baumbach stretch, even if he  like Francis  hasn't quite figured out where hes going yet.",1385942400,2,1701,4.656666666666666
5694139,4,B00C7C02KC,"This is an exceptional film. I didn't feel the full emotional impact for several hours and I'm still somewhat shaken by the script. I'm completely at a loss as to what makes critics and viewers think this film is a comedy. Of course, there are lots of sequences that have the sort of comic quality that Andy Kaufman had - what you might mistake for comedy is agony presented in a self-conscious ironic persona. But the film is tragic, and all the more so because it's so real - I've met so many of these characters. Just to put out my thesis, Frances is a 27 year old from a loving middle class family in Sacramento. She's a lovely, warm, church-going woman when she visits her parents who sings hymns with genuine fervor at their Unitarian church. Their house is a humble one on a block where all the houses look exactly alike. Frances went to what appears to be Vassar, where she met and bonded with another young woman. In fact, they love each other very deeply. Frances' friend is sort of a ""Leaning In"" type, but Frances studies dance. Both move to...of course...Brooklyn. And here is what the film is about. This is a love story, but a love so far platonic. Frances believes she is straight, but if a man even touches her on her shoulder she shrieks and pulls away. Her male BFFs jokingly call her ""undateable"". Frances' love interest, her girlfriend, has no emotional desire to marry, but dates men and becomes engaged to a banker type. Their love for each other may never be fulfilled. Critically, when Frances arrives in New York, she finds herself in alien terrain, with people unlike anything she has ever encountered. For a while she lives with two young men, about 5 years younger than her, both of them trust fund babies living rough. This is so real - I know a Millennial billionaire's daughter who grew up on Park Avenue in the building where Katie Couric lived who dresses in hideous thrift store clothing and lives with roomies in a hole in Astoria. And so Frances, the Brooklyn version, who earns nothing failing as a dancer, affects a gawky persona that most people find quite uncomfortable. In any case, this part is what the critics think the film is about, but it isn't. The film is about whether Frances and her friend will ever complete their love for each other. The film should have an ambiguous ending, or a sad one, but because Scott Rudin produced it a ridiculous happy ending is tacked on that almost destroys the integrity of the movie. This is also very much a commentary on the New York 20-something scene.

5694142,4,B00C7C02KC,"Greta Gerwig, even in a field crowded with great performances this year - is still receiving potential Oscar buzz for FRANCES HA, and after seeing the film I can see why. She both co-wrote and stars in this black-and-white comedy, set in New York City, that is the story of a young woman in her late twenties, Frances, who doesn't quite have her own place, isn't quite a dancer, and isn't quite talking to her best friend anymore.

In other words, it's a completely realistic portrait of a young woman who has yet to grow up. Frances wants to be a dancer, yet isn't quite talented enough so she remains an apprentice for a small dance company where she occasionally mentors or even teaches kids, while working on a ""career"" that will never happen. When he best friend and roommate Sophie moves out on her to live in Chelsea, Frances ends up bumming a room from a pair of their guy friends, but never truly has a place of her own. What the film is about is this girl, and how she remains sweet and lighthearted and positive even while deluding herself, and how (or if) she learns to grow up and really fend for herself as the realities of life - and living in New York City - tumble in. Greta Gerwig is brilliant here, pulling it back just when you almost feel Frances could get annoyingly trite and making you hope she will learn to adjust and be okay. The black and white photography actually enhances the film, giving it an almost Woody Allen feel.

Here's the scoop. Things aren't going well with Frances Halladay. She can't seem to get into a good relationship. She's still an understudy in the dance troop with which she performs and her best friend is moving to Japan. So she's performing a soft spiral downward. What to do?

There's a lot going on here. Greta Gerwig (Frances) wrote the script along with director Noah Baumbach and she certainly has something, or somethings, in mind. Part of it deals with communication. Through mass and social media we've become so self aware we have a difficult time communicating honestly with one another. We always seem to see ourselves from the outside, as though we're viewing ourselves on TV. And relationships have gotten weird. For instance: Frances and Sophie are in love with each other but are not lesbian. I don't know if I've ever seen this depicted quite this way in film. They are really all each other needs in their lives. And Frances is an artist at heart. She is a dancer but doesn't seem to be very good. But she might be a heck of a choreographer. It were as though Van Gogh himself couldn't paint but could direct others to create masterpieces. All these things, and others, do create both a story and character arc but it's more subtle. You have to dig for it to organize what appears to be a big mess on the outside. But that's Frances' life. Moving from one place to another, one situation to another and one job to another.

That sort of describes the story of FRANCES HA, recently released by The Criterion Collection in a Blu-ray/DVD combo-pack.

Frances, charmingly played by Greta Gerwig, is a 27 year-old wannabe dancer, struggling to survive in the artistic world of New York.  Unfortunately, Greta is not going to make it as a dancer, but there is hope that she could become a successful choreographer if only she can recognize that fact.

Her dream starts to fall apart when her best friend and roommate (Mickey Sumner) decides to move out of their apartment in favor of a better place with another roommate.  This is the first of a series of disappointments for Frances who finds herself moving from place to place as her finances and job opportunities dwindle.

Its possible to view Frances as a train wreck, particularly when she uses a new credit card to purchase a two-day trip to Paris where she finds herself virtually alone.  Finally, the girl/woman seems to get her head on straight and she seizes an opportunity that may not get her to the stars, but might wind her up in the treetops.

Written (with Gerwig) and directed by Noah Baumbach, this black-and-white romantic comedy is reminiscent in its style of Woody Allens MANHATTAN, as well as some of the French New Wave films of the 1960s.  Its a sweet portrait of one of many lost souls in New York City, hoping to find her way.  As an audience, were certainly pulling for her.

The 2-disc Criterion set presents the film in a new high-def digital master, approved by Baumbach.  Extras on both discs include a conversation between the director and Peter Bogdanovich, a conversation between actress/filmmaker Sarah Polley and Gerwig, and a conversation with Baumbach and others about the look of FRANCES HA.  There is also a booklet, featuring an essay by playwright Annie Baker.

They shared a similar tonal approach and yet The Squid & the Whale felt very much like a Wes Anderson film to me, while Greenburg felt a little more grounded in realism (not saying that its the better film, because its not).  With Frances Ha, Baumbach adds yet another layer to his stylistic approach and delivers something I wasn't expecting and really responded to.

This is, by far, my favorite of the three films.

Briskly paced and yet filled to the brim with development, Frances Ha has a real firm hold on its identity and it understands how to engineer itself to be as effective as possible.  There is no fat here, the film just flows from scene to scene, and the character development here (more than one character even) feels so defined and so intended.  You understand these characters, where they started and where they are headed.  This may be my favorite character study of the year so far, and it certainly is one of the finest ensembles (so uniformly organic and honest).

The film tells the story of Frances Haliday.  Frances is in her late twenties, living in New York with her best friend Sophie and attempting (however marginally) to become a dancer.  Shes stuck.  She doesnt have the motivation necessary to grow up, and shes apathetic (maybe too harsh a word) about it, completely content to just be a kid for life.  Like she admits, shes not a real person yet and it shows in the way that she navigates through life.  Life is about to throw her a curveball, and jumpstart her motivation.

Sophie grows up and moves on.

Starting with Sophie moving out and then trickling down into every aspect of her life (broke, couch jumping, bridge burning, friend losing, job losing, dreams crushed), Frances faces some real world problems here that are amplified by the consistency of it all.  As she unravels, Frances weaves through her circumstances with an air of naivety, as if it really isn't sinking in how desperate shes become, until it all comes together in the end.  Broaching some really intricate themes, Frances Ha really finds ways to build such a well-rounded and relatable character, despite her obvious quirks and grating persona.  Yes, Frances is hard to take at times and yet she is so believable.  This is thanks, in large part, to Gerwigs astonishing performance, but this role is perfect for her.  What appears like an easy transition though (just play quirky) is harder than it seems, as Greta has to shade Frances with so many unsaid emotions, and she does a wonderful job of allowing Francess reaction shots to speak for themselves.

I want to applaud Baumbach, who shows so much style and grace while directing this film.  It could have been very average or run of the mill, but instead he imparts a real radiance to the film.  His progression of story reminded me of early Woody Allen, and the way he builds his premise reminded me of the classic comedies of yesteryear.  In fact, the decision to shoot in B&W was rather inspired because it called to mind those quirky comedies of the 30s.

Not only is the film beautiful to look at, but it has a real soul, a real beat.",1384387200,12,3272,4.62738301559792
5694155,4,B00C7C02KC,"I think Noah Baumbach is one of the best filmmakers out there right now, and Frances Ha lived up to the expectations I had because of this. People have complained about Frances being unlikeable, I disagree. Is she likeable? Not necessarily, but she is a real person played phenomenally by Greta Gerwig (who also co-wrote the script with Baumbach).

This movie is funny, beautifully shot, tugs at the heart, made me cringe, and even made me ponder my own life at times. It got a Criterion release right off the bat for Pete's Sake!

""Frances Ha"" is a solid 8/10, and definitely worth a watch in my opinion.",1383696000,2,605,4.592592592592593
5694156,4,B00C7C02KC,"This is a theatrical review.  It may contain spoilers.

I've seen several of Noah Baumbach's films as well as those of his girlfriend and star in this film Greta Gerwig. I've always found Gerwig's characters to be a bit odd but still very likable. This is her best film yet.

She plays Frances, a 28 year old understudy at a small New York ballet company. She's not very good, but she doesn't know it. Her best friend and roommate, Sophie (Sting's daughter Mickey Sumner) have an unusual friendship but Sophie decides to move in with her boyfriend (Michael Esper). This leaves Sophie in a bit of a lurch as their lease is up for renewal. She temporarily moves in with a couple dudes (Adam Driver and Michael Zegen) who are friends of a friend. Eventually she loses her position in the ballet because of financial cutbacks.

As Frances sputters away from her dream of being a dancer and yes, finding a guy - friends joke she's undatable - she finds refuge with her parents played by Gerwig's real parents. She then moves on to her alma mater in upstate New York to do some meager jobs, but gets room and board. At times you want to yell at Frances to get it together, but then you realize that is what she's trying to do. The film is mix of Lena Dunham's ""Girls"" with a little Whit Stillman and a lot of Woody Allen, including the use of black and white filming. Good flick.",1378339200,11,1373,4.41501976284585
5694157,5,B00C7C02KC,"I won't say much about ""Frances Ha,"" since others on this page have already covered the spectrum. I thought it was terrific, but then I can't be completely objective because I have a Frances in my life, making her way in Chicago, currently twenty-two. If you have a Frances in your life you do need to see this peek into your Frances' life. What I found particularly appealing was Baumbach's riff on the notion that there is no app for actual living.",1377302400,3,450,4.5
5694158,5,B00C7C02KC,"It's a great movie. First of all its black and white. And being black and white, it's great. Kids nowadays sometimes can not imagine that black and white can be fantastic movie, that color sometimes took away some important view. Second of all, this movie bring to the heart quietness and right view on many things in life.

I did not enjoy watching Greta Gerwig, much either. She was not interesting to look it, and yet this movie was shot like a french film in which we linger on a compelling actresse's face.

8578062,4,B00C7C02KC,"What is 2013 to Gen-Y? Again, the theme of the current culture climate is the predominating motif throughout the past year in film, and of the group, Frances Ha that paints the most accurate picture of them all. In some cases its the most unique of the bunch because since it doesnt involve violent crimes or insane sex romps. Frances Ha functions as the enactment: a 27 year old dancer struggling to make a respectable living in New York City, and her living on the edge of poverty begs to ask the question of how does the other half live? The 99%? The authentic mainstream America? The film does not lead us to assume Frances is a failure as a person, rather someone just dealt on unfair hand in life, coping with the financial pressures and the burden of embarrassment to family and friends. Great Gerwigs performances makes her the icon of what the late 20s Gen-Y is: determined, light-hearted, blas and living life with some spontaneity (random 2 day trip to Paris). It wouldnt work if Frances was played by a glamour star; image how different the film would be if either Anna Kendrick, Francesca Eastwood, or Kate Mara in the role of Frances Ha. Displayed in a black and white setting as if these years are truly uncolorful and fall short of the full lust of life. In no way is it trying to be dated, rather cool retro, because the screenplay is still intact for the modern age with ATMs and Apple products all accounted for.",1514419200,,1431,4.528957528957529
8578063,2,B00C7C02KC,"Bloody tobacco industry.  The film started with beautiful people, sparky interesting dialog and fun artistic themes, and then they have to f*** it up by smoking.  NOT fun.  I am so sick of big tobacco's insidious perversion of the arts, just so that they can make more profits by addicting and killing people.

To the producer: Next time, make the film without selling out to big tobacco.  If you don't have enough funds to do it without their dirty money, then cut back and do a different film with less budget, more grit and more authenticity.  PLEASE.  I watched the first 20 minutes, but when they started smoking together inside the guy's apartment, that was enough.  This could have been 5 stars.  Shame.",1509148800,,710,4.7073170731707314
