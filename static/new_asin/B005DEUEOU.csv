4658892,4,B005DEUEOU,"Season 1 ended with Hei and Yin on the run from the syndicate. After losing Yin, Hei turns to alcoholism and finds odd jobs away from the syndicate in Russia where he meets Suo, a young Russian contractor that shares similiar characteristics as Hei, emotions that contradict a contractor.

What ensues, is a plot that revolves around a predestined end of the world scenario.

As with ssn 1, ssn 2 carries on the trend of strong character development, interesting contractor abilities and even stranger payments. The only real issue with Darker than Black Season 2 comes in the form of, lacking the same conclusiveness of the first season, and with no planned follow up as of yet, it may be some time before we get that closure. Season 1's end, though somewhat interpretive, practically implied: the world was safe, things were as they were, except for the world's half acknowledgement of the existence of contractors and Hei & Yin, disappeared into the night with the syndicate behind them. Season 2 on the other hand, ends somewhat abruptly and blatantly hints at forthcoming events. The packaged 4 episode OVA, effectively acts as a bridge between the two seasons.

This is not meant to act as a deterrent though. What's left is just as one would expect from Darker Than Black, a dramatic/action masterpiece. Though in this season, emphasis isn't placed primarily on the intensity of the action, more so it is placed on a more emotionally engaging story. One that will at some point or another, break you heart.",1320796800,,1513,4.8565891472868215
4658893,4,B005DEUEOU,"I will in the review give my reasons as to why the 2nd season is very good and not worthless in terms of story like most people try to make it out to be. This first part will be a review of the 2nd seasons content and then a product review overall.

The 2nd season follows after the OVA's left off where Hei is now in a stupor as he searches for Yin who was kidnapped, he arrives in Russia working for the CIA where he is sent to capture a boy named Shion.

So the 2nd season of Darker than Black had a lot of hate given to it because of the confusion about what happened to Yin and Hei. Also many didn't like the introduction of a new character a young girl named Suou. This confusion was the result of many people not watching the OVA's between the 1st and 2nd season. This was critical because it explains what happened to Yin. Suou as a character was great or bad she was just along for the ride and this was meant to be because of event that happen in the story with the character Shion.

Another important aspect of where people get confused is the fact that Darker than Black is following the Izanami/Izanagi/Kagutsuchi legend, which helps to explain what the over arching ideas of the story are and how the names correspond to the characters. Most believe that Hei is Izanagi, Yin is definitely Izanami, and the result of their being together would be Kagutsuchi. The last few being speculation by most viewers, but this helps to clarify their story and why Yin is changing from a normal doll to something else

Okay on to the actual product review, this version was perfect for someone who already owns the 1st season if it comes in a single DVD case because the chipboard case leaves room for the 1st season so all of it can be held in one box. Of course the issue being with the set though is if you don't have the first season than you have to keep the placeholder that comes with the box or else you'll have an empty space, but likely if you're buying this product than you already have the 1st season. This box has some great artwork, as well as the Blu rays and DVD have artwork on them that each was distinct and very nice to look at. I checked the quality of the 2nd season on Blu-Ray which looked great and I checked the OVA's on DVD which looked even better than the 1st season. There was no production drop off or budget cuts for this series.

Overall i would give the box set a 5/5 for having a blu-ray and dvd combo, a great chipboard box, and great artwork. The OVA's are 4/5, and the 2nd season a 4/5 because while the show is highly enjoyable, the animation is great, there is the issue of not clarifying everyone's role throughout the series which would require re-watching the series once or twice to catch each important detail and make it clear.",1320796800,6,2774,4.286259541984733
4658894,3,B005DEUEOU,"If you are buying this product i would assume you have watched the first season and are a big fan of it. Now that being said this second season is a huge departure from the first. Personally i felt the story took alot of what the first had and took it away. Take away great battles, deep characters, and throw in an annoying character from Russia who has alot of problems and you have the set up for a not so good second season. Now im not saying the story is horrible, far from it, its just ...... well......different. Alot of what i liked of the first seasons which was getting to know alot about the main characters seem to have been lost on a focus on a new character who isn't as interesting in my eyes. If you just need to see this anime i would recommend this set though the roof. The quality is amazing and the voice acting is as great as ever. It comes with the case pictured which also lets  you  store seasons 1 & 2 in it which as a nerd that was just like the little added touch that made the buy worth it. Funimation knows how to make a great looking bluray touch up and im glad i waited to see this on Bluray than online .

Here's a little sum up for those who just don't want to read all that. If you like Darker Than Black season 2 is a must see. Bumped up visuals and a nice case for both your seasons is something that to me was worth the 30 something dollars to purchase this. If you could care less about Bluray to Dvd and have no use for a case to hold your anime than i would say this is a rent rather than a buy.",1320710400,,1535,3.9611650485436893
4658895,5,B005DEUEOU,"I love Darker than Black, it is an amazing series filled with funny moments, philosophical, action, and great characters!! I can't wait to get this!! I support Darker than Black and i hope with season 2 sales there might be a season 3!!!!",1319587200,,238,4.558139534883721
4658896,2,B005DEUEOU,"For anyone that loved the first series and expected the second to be just as good will only be disappointed by it. This season manages to remove Hei's awesome and cool character that you found yourself rooting for in the first season and replaces it with a brainless idiot that makes you frustrated when watching him run around without a purpose. Also they don't follow up on the first season, instead they come up with some random story half thought out in which too much info is left out to figure out the story and your left wondering and trying to fill in the blanks on your own. literally we see more of Suou pulling a giant sniper rifle out of her chest and her inability to shoot anyone then any story as gripping as the first season. To sum it up your not going to get a similar season to the first instead you get a boring(what's going on?) season with annoying characters.
The ova's are decent however also follow the lines of a random storyline in which a character you didn't think much of is suddenly a key character because they had to make a base for the second season. However the ova's managed to regain some of Hei's personality that made him an awesome protagonist so their worth watching... Also if you do end up watching the second season make sure to watch the ova's first.",1318636800,15,1295,4.422594142259414
4658897,2,B005DEUEOU,"If you liked the first season for the great character work or music, and perhaps thought the second half of it wasn't quite as good as the first, know that this season continues the downward trend and then some. In fact it is barely the same show. I am not exaggerating when I say it has basically become the magical girl genre. This is not a joke. That girl on the cover? Yeah, she totally has a transformation scene every episode that involves a gun coming out of her naked body. AGAIN NOT JOKING. Google that. It is real. Also the token talking animal (the first season technically had the talking cat, but not in conjunction with high school girls transforming, and certainly not in the same cutesy way it is used here. To take it further there are love triangles and annoying anime stereotype ""sweat drops"" and ""anger crosses"" everywhere and often at the most inappropriate times. This is all in addition of course the the sad fact that it isn't even any good in its own right. The dialogue is just a bunch of nonsense that makes no sense. The plot never goes anywhere, and nothing is ever explained.

*SPOILER*
For some reason there are 2 Yins, and one is evil and super powerful and can destroy the world.
*END SPOILER*

The music while not terrible doesn't really fit the style of the show, and the fights are boring and predictable. The first two episodes aren't all that bad and have the same tone of the first season, but...

*SPOILER*
Pretty much the moment the little girl somehow absorbs Hei's powers it all just falls apart
*END SPOILER*

TL;DR: If you are one of those people that liked to pretend that Hei and November 11 were a gay couple, or draw fanart of Yin making out with people, you are probably their target audience and will love it. Everyone else stay far away.",1317945600,7,1789,4.495384615384616
4658898,5,B005DEUEOU,"Ok, I had read plenty of reviews, and I own the First Season of Darker than Black, so when I heard about season 2, I was kinda nervous. This review won't have me describing the whole plot over to you, so scroll up if you need to know it. This is what I thought of the Second Season. This does contain some spoilers.

This box set contains 4 OVA's that show what happens to Yin and Hei during the 2 year gap from season 1 and 2. It contains 2 commentaries, textless songs and previews for other animes. There are 5 discs, but 2 of them are for BluRay.

Now, I read reviews, from this site and others saying that it wasn't as good as the first. I agree with most of that statement.
*SPOILERS*: I loved this second season for multiple reasons:
1. All the voice actors returned for their original role. Jason is still Hei and Briana is still Yin. John is still Mao and the British kid for the British boy doll is still the same actor as well. So I am pleased they recruited everyone for their characters.
2. I'm not sure what everyone else was thinking, but the fight scenes are still bad ass. Yes, Hei does lose his powers in episode 3 or 4, not sure, but he still kicks ass, even tho he is a drunk and has too much hair on his head. I heard lots of people complaining that Hei sucks and he doesn't fight. Well you must have been watching the wrong anime because Hei was fighting in almost every episode and the fights were still as epic as season 1. In my opinion, he still kicks serious butt. And he does win most of those fights..
3. Speaking of fights, the animation was absolutely stunning. Not a single sloppy episode.
4. The new characters are not as bad as everyone says honestly. Suou (the main new character with the big ass gun),is annoying at times, and the fact that she fell for Hei is kinda sad and predictable. (And don't worry all the HeixYin fans, Hei doesn't go for Suou, she is like 12 years old and Hei loves Yin :) ) But there are new contractors with never before seen powers that really make Hei work to protect himself.
5. And in my opinion, this second season was actually pretty good. I don't think it was particularly needed, they could have ended it after season 1 and that would have been good. But I thought it wasn't a bad sequel. It still had the suspense and edginess that season 1 had. Great music, some humor and like i said before, awesome fight scenes.
6. The OVA's are pretty awesome. If you love Hei x Yin and like a little bit of a side story, focusing on the two love birds, you will love this addition to season 2. I may be bias because I am a hopeless romantic and a Hei x Yin fan, but I still think it was done well, and made sense.
7. The ending was the only thing that i was a little disappointed in. Again, just like season 1, a very open ended ending. I would have liked to see the result of one situation in particular but I guess my imagination works just fine.
Those are my personal thoughts about Darker than Black Season 2. I think if you have seen the first season, you should at least give the second season a chance. Don't buy it right away, check it out on youtube or hulu or something. But I think if you enjoyed season 1, you should at least give it a chance, and not turn away from it just because some people didn't like it. I was worried I wasn't going to like it, but I was surprised when I didn't just like it, I love season 2.

***And for those who haven't seen season 1 and you are thinking about buying this season before the first, my strong recommendation is to watch 1 before 2, because you will be lost!***",1314403200,,3575,4.170767004341534
4658899,4,B005DEUEOU,"2 years have passed since the events in the first season. Suo Pavlichenko is a teenage girl living in Russia with her scientist father and Contractor brother, whose life is turned upside down one day when her father is murdered, his lab destroyed, and her brother disappears. On the run from several different factions who mistake her for her brother, Suou teams up with Hei to get to Tokyo to find her mother.

I have mixed feelings about this series. I loved the first season, so I started with high expectations. It still had many of the elements that I loved in the first season - mysteries, characters with unknown agendas, Hei - but it also shifted its focus a little by making Suo the main character. This season has more teenage angst then the first, and Suo is kind of annoying. She also has a boring transforming type sequence the animators loved. Hei has gone through some trauma that isn't really explained (though I hear it is explained in the OVA), and he spends the series working back up to his former cool self.

But he does work out of his depression. Suo starts to grow up. Mao is a flying squirrel. And the somewhat mediocre story works up to a sufficiently mind bending ending. I did enjoy this season, but most of it was brightened by my love of the first series. If you really loved the first series, you might enjoy seeing the second just for more Darker Than Black. Or you might just want to stop while you are ahead, and leave your memories of Darker Than Black at the end of the first season.

This series is a nice length, at just 12 episodes, which is long enough for some interesting things to happen, and short enough that Suo can't drive you insane. I still can't say whether or not I recommend it though.

PS The OVA is 4 episodes long, but I haven't seen it. Apparently it is about what happens to Hei and Yin in between seasons 1 and 2.",1313539200,14,1871,4.38328530259366
4658900,3,B005DEUEOU,"**CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK**

The first season of Darker than Black ended with Hei and Yin escaping from the syndicate, and you think that's where season two would begin the aftermath of their escape... welp, it doesn't. Take a deep breath, and prepare to take in one of the most mediocre sequels to one of my favorite animes. When the second season begins, Hei has long hair and has become a drunk. Why?  We don't know why.  Meanwhile, we go into a new story about a Russian girl named Suo. Hei just happens to be on a mission that groups them up together, and it starts on of the biggest annoyances of the series - Hei training a little girl.  Early on in the series, Hei loses his powers, and it makes the action scenes after this sort of suck.  All of the action we were used to from Season One is pretty much all gone, with the exception of our new character, Suo, who wields a giant rifle (which is the ONLY cool thing about her). -- Update: After re-watching Season 2, I admit that Hei's strategies for fighting without his powers was still interesting. I guess I was just feeling bitter about S2 at the time.

You all may think I'm being overly harsh on season two but I'm not. If you loved the first season as much as I did, you would hate season 2 as much I do. However, it doesn't mean that the second season isn't worth watching at all. It does fill in a few loose ends about what happened to some other characters from season one. It also introduces some new contractors who have some pretty interesting abilities.  Yoko Kanno's fantastic soundtrack from the first season is also gone, which also makes the music in this season forgettable. The series is also relatively short with 12 episodes unlike Season one which was 25 episodes. I won't spoil the ending of S2 but to sum it up, I didn't like it.

I was going to recommend avoiding this, but this set also includes a four episode OVA that aired a year after season two. This OVA is what should have aired before season two, as it shows what happens to Hei & Yin after season one.  Watching the OVA before season two is mandatory.

I applaud Funimation for packing both the OVA & Season Two together. As I would of avoided buying season two altogether if they would of released it separately.

4658953,4,B005DEUEOU,"Like a lot of you who are considering buying this, I loved the first season of Darker than Black. It had great action, entertaining characters, and a cool lore developed around the concept of Contractors, Gates, etc. Naturally, I wanted more of this unique and dark world, so getting Season 2 was a no-brainer. But I'll say this; while good, Season 2 is not a perfect sequel. However, it's still more than worth your time if you're a fan.

To begin, it's worth mentioning that Hei is no longer the main protagonist. He's still a major character, but this season focuses more on a young girl named Suo. Upon discovering that she is a Contractor, Suo embarks on a journey alongside Hei in pursuit of answers regarding her past. Suo's story is full of mystery and heartbreak, but she is fairly optimistic despite the life-threatening circumstances she finds herself in. While some may not agree with me, I have to say that this is where I consider Season 2 an improvement over the first; the overall tone is consistently lighter and more optimistic this time around.

Like I mentioned above, Hei and some other characters from the first season are present, although you may not care for how the infamous Black Reaper is represented here. Don't get me wrong, he's still as cool and tough as he was last season, but his outlook and mood have darkened, resulting in him having a nasty drinking habit. Thankfully, he sobers up halfway through the season, but for someone who likes the character, the darker attitude left me confused. This is where I recommend that you watch the OVA before starting Season 2 itself (it's included on the 3rd DVD disc and the 2nd Blu-Ray disc) because otherwise, you won't really get why he acts the way he does or what happened to Yin. I watched the series before watching the OVA, which made me understand a lot more about what was going on in Season 2, but I think it would have been better if I had knowledge of that information in the first place.

As for the visuals, not much has changed since Season 1, which isn't a complaint by any means. I enjoyed the crisp visuals of Season 1, and they carry over quite nicely here. The fight scenes, however, are a noticeable improvement, being animated more fluidly and vividly; the only downside is that there's not as many fight scenes as the first season. You'll also notice that everything looks brighter and more colorful, a definite plus in my book. Overall, everything looks great.

While I've brought up a lot of good things about this Season, there is a reason I'm not giving it a perfect review; it's mostly because of the story. Like I mentioned above, the tone is more positive this time around, but the actual events that unfold over the series left me asking for a little bit more in terms of substance. This season is only 12 episodes long in comparison to the 25 of Season 1, and I felt like more time to build on what's happening and why could have greatly improved this season. Suo is a fairly well-developed character, but other new characters don't quite get the buildup I was hoping for, and returning characters could have been used to greater effect (when you see what kind of animal Mao is inhabiting, you'll get what I mean). I'm not asking for a bunch of exposition, but I wanted more reasons to hate the bad guys and love the good guys other than what we see in the present.

There's also the issue I had with the lore of the world itself. I was thoroughly enticed by the mystery surrounding Contractors, Dolls, and the Gates that have appeared around the world, but we aren't given that much to go on this Season. There are some interesting things developing around what exactly the difference between a Contractor and a Doll are, as well as what additional powers Dolls have, but I felt like there are more questions than answers to be had here; I'm not asking for everything to be explained, but again, some deeper answers would have been nice. In particular, the ending to this season is a major cliffhanger that will undoubtedly leave you asking for more, but as of writing this review, it's late 2015 and I've yet to hear confirmation of a 3rd Season.

I don't think I need to explain the dub/sub thing, since most of you watching this will have already seen Season 1 and made your minds up as to what you prefer. I really liked the dub in Season 1, and it continues to be solid for Season 2.

Even for all of its faults, Season 2 is a worthy continuation of the series. Most of the characters are likable, the action is entertaining to watch, and this dark world has become somewhat brighter and more hopeful. It has a few issues that may leave you asking for more, but you'll still be satisfied with what you do get. The stars have faded somewhat, but they're still shining.",1439510400,,4782,4.540603248259861

4/5 OVAs

I watched Season 2 first and then was told to watch it again after watching the OVAs, while the OVAs are drastically better and more of what fans expect of DTB, Season 2 is still a piece of garbage in my opinion. In spite of the potential the OVAs left us with season two definitely falls flat, the plot is a disaster and the characters are very 2-D and for the most part annoying, the main female character Suo especially (and her contractor ""transformation"" that takes up a good 2 minutes does not help.) Season 2 has a lot of random fighting and a plot that even with knowing the OVA just seems to be very empty and not hold nearly the weight that was in Season 1.

I found that this did not matter, the season felt like a stand alone season, and I was not spoiled the first season when I did watch it.
 The characters were a little forgettable, and there was a whole lot of action like I was expecting, although when there was a fight it was very good. These two complaints, are not that big a deal though, and are not the main thing that made me give the season three stars. The over all plot and story saved these last two cons from ruining it. Why I am mainly giving this three stars is because it was two short and rushed through it engaging plot.
Over all I think this season is good but not worth the money for someone who is not a die hard anime fan.

4658992,3,B005DEUEOU,"[SLIGHT SPOILERS]

There are actually two reviews necessary--one for Season 2 and one for the OVA's.  Concerning the OVA's, they are excellent.  The plot thickens between Hei and Yin and the action scenes are some of the best in the entire series.  The animation ramps up as well, as though the animators tried to outdo every original fight scene from Season 1, and cram more of them into four episodes.  I think they succeeded.  Stream the OVA's and enjoy them.

Season 2, on the other hand, is simply a disaster.  If it were its own anime, I would say it was mediocre, but being billed as a follow-up and worthy successor to The Black Contractor, it's simply a farce.  At times, it seemed to me that Gemini could have actually been an entirely different anime, so altered was the original structure of DTB.  Most horrifying is Hei's complete character transformation (becoming a drunk, letting his facial hair grow out, and basically looking like a homeless person).  Some have argued that this transformation ""deepens his character flaws"" or some such.  I argue that it ruins him as a character.  I think the majority of audiences would have wanted the Hei from the OVA's to continue kicking a** through Season 2, and I am among them.  Bones dropped the ball on this one.

The second most obvious irritation is the introduction of Suo, and the whole ""training"" situation a la The Professional.  Except that Suo really has no redeeming qualities to make me interested in her in the slightest--not to mention that her power (pulling a giant piece of artillery out of her chest) sucks as a power--especially when she can only fire a couple of times!  Furthermore, we are FORCED TO WATCH THE ANIMATION OVER AND OVER, this annoying child pulling a gun out of her chest.  And yes, the animation is long enough to become tiresome.  Had no one at Bones ever played Final Fantasy VIII?

Season 2 was not terrible.  I was happy to see some of the old characters return (Mao, July, April).  The ending was ridiculous, and it seemed that very slowly, the powers of contractors increased beyond reasonable belief (someone's power is that they can create worlds?).  Especially when said power is only introduced because the series needs to end somehow.

The OVA's receive five stars for being exactly as the writers planned them to be: action-packed, character-deepening, gorgeous displays of chaotic violence.  Season 2 receives two stars for reasons previously mentioned, and the added fact that someone at Bones actually thought it was going to be a good show.",1387584000,,2552,4.824884792626728
4659013,4,B005DEUEOU,Darker Than Black is one of my favorite anime series. The first season was amazing and although this one is good it just doesn't measure up. Still interesting and alot of action. Would still recommend it.,1387411200,,204,4.694444444444445
4659014,5,B005DEUEOU,"The first season of Darker than Black (DTB) was a great noir, drama, comedy, super powered, sci-fi show. Can the second season top the first season? The first season's episodes were almost always two-parters, and then they would move on to another storyline. When you think that that episode didn't contribute to the overall plot, you would be proven wrong later on in the show. The second season is a story based series, rather than episodic. All the episodes are connected like most modern non-comedy anime.

This collection is distributed by Funimation, just like the first season, so all reoccurring characters have the same voices. Note that the 13 episodes are listed first on the DVDs, and then the 4 OVA episodes. I originally watched the set in that order, and was very confused because many plot points are explained in the OVAs. The OVA episodes take place before the second season episodes, so be sure to watch them first. The third DVD in the set has all the OVAs, then you can watch disc one and two afterwards. The Blue Ray has the OVAs on the second disc along with the later episodes of the season.

This season does feature Hei (aka BK 201) as the main character again, but the series focuses a lot on a young red haired girl named Su Pavlichenko, who gets mixed up with Hei and Mao, the cat from the first season. If you want to know what happened to Yin from the first season, just watch the OVAs and you will understand; she does prove to be an important character in the OVAs and the second season, despite her not being in too many episodes.

If you thought that the first season had a lot of unusual characters, coupled with unusual special abilities and unusual payments, then you need to watch this collection. It seems like every time they create a ridiculous power, they top it with an even crazier power, and it is always satisfying to see the characters feel challenged by an even greater threat.

The plot grows even more complex in this season, and there are more organizations, and people you are not sure if you should trust along the way. There are a lot of cameos from the first season, and its is always refreshing to see old friends again. Overall, this is a really good series, but be aware that it is even darker than the first season, and most of the series does not even take place in Tokyo, which is also refreshing to see Russia in an anime.",1381276800,19,2385,4.501154734411085

4659021,4,B005DEUEOU,"this one didn't seem as good. It felt like there were fewer action scenes and more focus on character development. That may seem odd, because, who doesn't want character development? I sure like my characters fully rounded. What I mean by this is that the balance between action and character development that was present in the first series was off in this one.

It is also important to keep in mind that before you watch this second series, please note that this comes with the OVAs as well. These, in my opinion, must be watched first before the actual season is watched. They are kind of like a prequel that gives a frame of reference for the second season. Be warned, though, the OVAs are MUCH different from the first and even the second series as it is nearly all character development (with a love story..I think..maybe?).

Once I understood everything, this was a great second season. Again, much different from the first season, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just different. One complaint though. The girl, Suo (I don't know if that's how you spell it or not, and frankly don't care; you'll know who I mean when you watch it) has the power to generate, from her body, an anti-tank sniper rifle. That's cool. That's unique. None of the X-Men ever had anything like that. However, I don't want to see her ""conjure"" it out of her body every time she uses it! Talk about an unnecessary time killer!

Other than that, I highly recommend this second season to those who have seen the first and wish it didn't end when it did.",1375315200,8,1533,4.547101449275362

4659034,1,B005DEUEOU,"I swear its like the Bones writers sat down and made of a list off everything that was amazing or pure awesome from the first series, decided to do the complete opposite.
This season was balls to the walls, shamelessly awful.
SPOILERS======================================================================================

Characters: I am not exaggerating when I say that there are no likable characters in Season 2.
If you liked Hei, say goodbye to his Chinese electric Batman moments early on in Gemini of The Meteor. If you liked Yin. She doesn't appear that much until the last two episodes... If you liked Mao, Say goodbye to his cat appearance, the new character Suo is treated as a main character in this season and the story is about her and what she's going through. There are some minor characters that I guess were interesting and some were pretty cool, especially Mina Hazuki, she's a katana wielding chick that kicks ass. Her katana looks ""Lightsaber""-ish, don't you think? If it is... The force is strong with her indeed...

In summary:

Hobo Hei? Just a violent drunk child abuser. Loses his power and remains like that for most of the season.

Suou? A brat; with the lamest contractor power EVER. This is not a joke. Yeah, she totally has a magical girl transformation scene every episode that involves a gun coming out of her naked body. AGAIN NOT JOKING. Google that. It is real.

Mao? An annoying squirrel; he barely even features in the story. How did he even survive anyway? He was supposed to have died in Season 1.

Yin? Now a suicidal godlike being.... W T F?! how does this improve/benefit the story?!!

Misaki? pointless, she became obsessed with this one random guy for no apparent reason. It's like she has no life outside of chasing Hei. Her character is absolutely pointless.
.

Story - Absolutely atrocious. Unlike season 1 there are no 2-episode arcs, instead there is one 12-episode arc. The story is complete nonsense as expected. The entire thing is predicated on some prophesy about 2 vague characters ""Izanami"" and ""Izanagi"" coming together to end the world. Here's what actually happened: Shion made a copy of THE EARTH ITSELF LOL where they can live happily ever after. If you thought the Season 1 ending was bad, check out Season 2, complete and utter nonsense.

Plot - Stupidly aimless and bereft of basically most of the useful details it should have, so I am not going to rehash that. What I will touch on is how the plot is awful with the characters it uses: it introduces lots of new characters, all poor creations that are impossible to care about; it has a lot of short, impossibly one sided battles; it gives random annoying flashes to some apparently crazy event involving Yin, with absolutely no real explanation as to why they happened; it has random, annoying flashes to these blonde twin girls, who speak in tittery, annoying voices and ""say mysterious things"" i.e. nonsensical; it has cop lady chasing desperately after Hei, despite the fact that she has no real insight to anything in this series, never does anything, and just wastes our time; it has former cool cat Mao back as an awful, ridiculously (poorly drawn) cartoony flying squirrel like creature (they called it a mamonga or something, whatever). Get the picture?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The defining feature of the entire series: how they manage to draw every character with dead eyes throughout the series, yet expect us to enjoy ourselves.

The defining scene: horrible side character creation 1, dreadlock kids, sobbing and venting to horrible side character creation 2, his cross dressing dad, culminating in being more likely to make you laugh than cry as he sobs and whines into his cake.

The defining question: how they expect us to believe Hei can still kick everyone in the world's ass with no powers and reduced to ""living the good life""

STAY ALWAY! Do not waste your money or time, if you loved season one than do yourselves a favor and never watch the season two or the ovas. There is no gain or enjoyment to be had watching this awful sequel.",1369180800,,4147,4.95821325648415

Although I'd seen varied reviews about season 2 from fans of the first season, I really enjoyed it. It's an intelligent story that is well told. My only suggestion would be to watch the OVAs (included after the season 2 episodes) BEFORE watching the 12 episodes of Season 2, as they fill in the gaps between the seasons. If you'd rather start with season 2 and see how your guesses about what happened in between compare with the official version, you should probably watch them in the order they appear on the discs.

This series has quickly become my favorite serious anime.

There is a lot of cool action and tons of interesting characters. The plot is also pretty original and compelling. Whether you're an anime fan or not DTB will leave an impression.

Season 2 is shorter and has a different vibe. One of my favorite characters, Yin, is missing. BK201 is trying to find her. Mao is still alive, surprisingly enough; and everybody's favorite detective still plays a crucial role.

4659076,5,B005DEUEOU,"Since coming out everyone loves to complain about the second season of Darker Than Black. I will explain why most if not all of these complaints are a result of the series being misunderstood.

The most abundant one is: its nothing like the first season.
Every anime season is produced at least on some level as a self contained being. There is no `five year plan`in anime. Each season is made with only the amount of episodes ordered (so in the case of DTB S1 they didn`t think beyond episode 26) in mind. When or if more does come the creators odften approach it as a seperate series. ie: GITS:2nd gig,Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino, or Eureka seven AO (a brillant series also being misunderstood and awfully treated.)
The crew had no intention of doing more of season 1 because thay already did that. They threw away the security blanket by having a diffrent setting and mostly diffrent charcters, allowing the franchise to evolve. That first episode is brillantly structred, showing an entirley diffrent group of pepole with one minor charecter from season 1 in a very diffrent context. The clifhanger being the reintroduction of the main charecter.

2. Suo and other anime cliches: As much as I love it the first season of Darker Than Black isn`t very orignal. Sharing a lot of elements with american superhero comics in particular but using them in a terrific way. Season 2 does much the same thing as Season 1 showed they are aware of the faults currently at heart at the anime industry. The writing team chose a le ts show em how its done approach in this regard. Suo is a strong charecter who won't bow to the adults and some pepole may find that approach noff putting but her story is a good one.(However even I cant defend what they did to Mao.)

3. The sexual elements: Accused by some as being pedophilic (In a thread  prasing Black Butler no less. Quite possibly the most phedopilic anime of the past few years)It isn't that simple. The opening really shows what this season is. A young girl seeing the world of Darker Than Black thinking it a nice calm place and learning it is a sick, depraved world. There is a transvestite but the idea there is to add a feeling of absurdisum. Hei and Yins relationship isn't a sexual one either. Its more of a sibling thing. Also at one point one of the main charecters is placed in negative light for participating in events only to get laid and a child rapist is potrayed as a horrifying individual. These elements are not the point of said events but rather an addtional layer of the situation.

Darker Than Black season 2 shows more that anything else that Anime fans are afraid of change. Even with the terrfifc Ovas to transtion them both plot wise and tonally they cant deal with it. No matter how exciting and intellegent of an adventure series it is. But thats okay because the season itself couldint care less what anyone else thinks of it.

4659078,4,B005DEUEOU,"I would have to say that I am one of the few people that like this season better then the first. With ""Bones"" handling the animation work(Wolf`s Rain, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) you know the animation is going to be top notch.

  This season comes chronologically after the frist, but, there are events that took place during the two seasons that you aren't going to find out till you watch the 4 OVA's that come w/ this season(even then there are still lot's of answered questions, but at least you don't have to wait as long as those of us who followed the fan subs of the series.) A lot of people complain about this season not answering questions from the first, but it is a geat setup for the 3rd season.

  Lot's of character development, wonderfully animated fight scenes, and I would have to say that it is a very emotional season. Much more so then the first.

Personally I think they should of stopped with the first season but they did not and well this one dose not live up to the first season but it is still enjoyable and it dose have a ending with kinda twist.

The Animation is Awesome (I like the style)

The voice acting is nice and clear

The story is Very dark.

This is a great Scf-fi Anime you do not catch everything everytime you watch it but it dose not get boring quick.

This disk also comes with the OVA, which actually came out after season 2.  That said, you MUST watch the OVA prior to watching season 2, it will make a whole lot more sense.  Those who have never watched DTB, you need to watch season 1, then OVA, then season 2.  Highly recommend the series, definitely a favorite of mine.

A slightly different tone than the first season but still good. Though I do have a few recommendations, first of all watch the OVA before watching the second season. It'll clear up a lot, also you'll need the internet for to understand the season finale. It was really confusing for me, but made sense once I looked it up online. It's a good series, and the second season doesn't disappoint. The OVA is really damn good as well.",1334275200,2,575,4.333333333333333
4659113,4,B005DEUEOU,"Darker than black has to be one of the best series ever. It's got great action and I don't know anyone who has seen it and not loved the series. I loved the OVAs which I didn't I get to see completed before now. They should really be watched between season 1 and 2 not after season 2, since they are the lost story of what happened in between the two. The main thing that season 2 lacks compared to season 1 is a lot of intrigue. There is still plenty of action, but it's more of a survival vs. finding out the truth sort of plot line.

Additionally I'm stuck with blu rays discs that I will never be able to use. So I would much rather save a few bucks and have the choice of buying only the discs I want. I'm really getting annoyed at Funimation's packaging of both dvds and blu rays together. Especially since they didn't do it for the first season. It's a total rip off and if I hadn't already seen and loved Darker than Black, I wouldn't take a chance on a series that is a combo, like I do with a lot of the S.A.V.Es.",1333843200,,1023,4.014705882352941

There is a few other nick picks on it also, but the main one is the ending.

4659116,5,B005DEUEOU,"I bought this dvd-box at amazon.com, since it isn't available like that in Europe (yet). It's duty-free because of the price (I'm from Austria), so the import didn't make any problems :)

Cover:
The simple dvd-cover, in the same style as the season 1 boxset*, has a carton-shell. This carton-shell shows Hei (and only Hei). I'd have preferred Suo to be on that cover too but ok...
The artwork on the dvds and its cover could be better, especially since I liked the cover-artwork of the first season box-set very much. It's not bad though.
The box-design is again very handy!

Content:
Well, the menu is pretty much in the same style as with the season 1 box-set. I haven't completely explored it yet, but it seems nice. The features include commentaries, the (textless) opening and closing, as well as some trailers. Some more character-drafts would have been nice too.
The box includes dvds and blu-ray discs, I can only review the dvds though ;) - The video-quality is good, as well as the sound. I recommend to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles btw.

Price:
I think it's a fair price.

Conclusion:
I would buy it again and I'd recommend it to friends... it's worth having it, especially next to the 1st season box-set :)

Not only was it every thing I expected it was Evan better in some aspects. Contrary to other reviews hei is still the main man, there is still alot of fighting and it is awesome! It was also very dark, agien contrary to other reviews. I found it to be darker than the first season actually. ( my opinion). My only complaint was that it was shorter than season 1 and they seem to just end it with alot of questions. I just hope they make a season 3, because this is one of my personal favorite anime.

Several obstacles arise such as new contractors, new organizations, and new responsibilities. Additionally, Suo, the new main protagonist, is taken under Hei's wing and is trained to fit her new role as a contractor while also trying to solve the mystery behind her brother Shion's disappearance. A little convoluted, the plot moves at steady pace and is well explained by the end of the series. Though, the pace is a little different from the first season it contains memorable characters from the past season and introduces a whole new set of deviants. The fight scenes remain suspenseful, the music splendid, and the animation above average.

NOTE: the 4 OVAs included are better watched before watching season two as they introduce season two's major conflict, Yin disappearance.",1324252800,,910,5.190476190476191
4659142,3,B005DEUEOU,"I will start off by affirming what others have said: Darker Than Black is AMAZING, with wonderful music, top-notch animation, one of the coolest main characters EVER, and an involved plot.  Darker Than Black: Gemini of the Meteor (or Darker Than Black Season 2) is a very, VERY weak follow up.  Gone is just about everything that I loved about the first series and hardly any questions posed by the end of the first DtB were answered at all.  I could describe this whole 12 episode season as being just another small 2 episode-long story in the first season.  Nothing happens!  It's slow and boring and the main (completely wonderful) protagonist has sunk to such a miserable low.  And don't get too attached to any character.  It's just not safe.

To the question of whether or not someone should buy this season, I answer maybe.  For one thing, purchasing this might encourage Funimation to release the first season on Blu-Ray or even encourage Studio BONES to continue the story with actual plot.  Possibly, anyway...  I can hope!  And another reason is just for the OVA included.  This OVA fills in some of the missing time between seasons and further explores many of the characters.  This is very helpful and, I think, absolutely worth watching, even if to alleviate some confusion.

(As a side note, more connecting information is revealed through the excellent manga entitled ""Darker than Black: Shikkoku no Hana"".)

Now, on to the product itself.  I have not put the discs into my player to watch yet so I can't account for the quality of the picture, but I can talk about this particular item and how it differs from the ""Normal Edition"".  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the sturdy box it came with that can house both Gemini of the Meteor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darker-Than-Black-Season-2-with-OVA-s-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B005DEUEOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darker Than Black: Season 2 with OVA's (Blu-ray/DVD Combo</a>) and the first season's complete collection (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darker-Than-Black-Complete-First-Season/dp/B003DC883I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darker Than Black: Complete First Season</a>).  This is pretty useless to me as I already own the individual dvds (having purchased them as they were released) in their artbox (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darker-Than-Black-Starter-Set/dp/B001F2U72S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darker Than Black: Starter Set</a>).

And that's another reason I'm hoping for DtB (the first season) to be released on Blu-Ray!  To fit in the empty space that the complete first season left behind!

To sum up, if you were in love with the first season and hate to see a poor successor to it, you probably can get away with not buying this.  If you're like me (a completionist, a Studio BONES animation fan, a lover of Blu-Ray, and a hopeful nerd), go ahead and buy this.  I certainly don't regret it.

Maybe if there's ever a Darker Than Black Season 3, the compounded questions will be finally be answered!  *hopeful nerd*",1323820800,2,3133,5.556962025316456

Well I can understand were people are coming from when they are unhappy with what happens to Hei. But whats makes a good anime or even show is not always an awesome character all the way through. They need to go through turmoil and get better because of it.(it might sound corny but it's vary true)

But on the other the OVA is awesome strait through Nothing to complain about them what so ever.

4659145,5,B005DEUEOU,"I think that this was a really good second season for an anime of this caliber. Now I will tell you that you will get a bit confused if you do not watch the OVAs first, I watched the OVA's(The OVAs came out after the anime had finished) when the became available and everything pretty much clicked plot-wise instantly. The plot is sound, the characters are good, and its the best way to top off the series. Don't let the opening credits fool you into thinking it's toned down in anyway at all. All the action and suspense you would expect from the DTB universe is crammed and concentrated into 12 epic episodes. The ending will leave you wanting more after you finish the OVAs. This anime has quickly become one of my all-time favorite anime, even over some of the most legendary anime that you'd find out there. I think it is well worth watching and purchasing as I have done. If you like it you like it and if you don't then you don't. But over all I think it's a very good anime experience and sets the bar high for a lot of the other anime out there in terms of awesomeness.

Really liked the OVA'S, they are the same style as Season 1.

Season 2 was ok until around the last episode.  I must be missing something watching the english dub because most of the last episode makes little sense.  About the only other gripe is the transform scene she keeps doing which does not fit with how contractors work in the series.  Makes the second season look like they tried to gear it for little kids or tweens. Honestly it is like the show was written by a different group.  First couple episodes are almost the generic ""coming of age"" type.

4659150,3,B005DEUEOU,"Season one of Darker than Black is filled with great action, intrigue, and such and such.  Season two lacks in almost every department.  Sure, there is some great action, but far too little of it.  I'm not going to moan about Hei's loss of his powers: in fact, the way he can still take out contractors without using any contractor power himself just underlines how bad a-- he really is.  No, the problem with this show is its focus: a twelve year old girl whose contractor power is a magical girl transformation and an anti tank rifle.  Now, she's not as bad as she could be: there's not too much whining from her, she's occasionally useful and can fight decently every once in a while.  No, the problem is that she sucks up all the attention and everything's focused on her, and she's just not that interesting, at least not until the last couple episodes.  Hei and Kirihara, the other awesome main character from season one, are relegated to the back seat so we can focus on a pretty boring 12 year old.

The OVA's are better than the second season in that, packed into 4 episodes is as much action as the entire 12 season two episodes.  The first OVA starts off with a four way fight between Hei and some syndicate contractors, so it's immediately intense.  The tone manages to match the first season better as well, being more tense and filled with a real and oppressive feeling of danger to our main characters. It also should be watched before the second season, as it sets that season up.

Now, for the packaging: the blu-ray/dvd combo comes in a nice art box big enough to slip the complete first season set into if you happen to have that version.  If, like me, you have the six dvd set released first, it also holds volume six nicely, as long as you didn't also have the big art box for THOSE volumes.  It's a nice touch, I guess.  I haven't watched the blurays yet, but the dvds look great.  The extras include a couple episode commentary tracks which are generally worth a listen, clean opening/endings and of course, trailers.  Is it just my imagination or are trailers getting shorter and shorter?

Any way, if you're a completionist you may as well pick this up.  The tonal and focus shift may annoy you, but it's not terrible.  It's at least worth watching once.  Like the first season, there's a lot of unanswered questions, including how the heck a meteor can fall when they can't launch anything off the surface of the planet and the stars are the souls of contractors, but they aren't enough to really break the story or anything.  The animation is beautiful over all and there's a couple decent action sequences.  The music varies from techno to porno, and is pretty bland.  A couple good tracks make it not terrible.  So yeah.

TL:DR:
Plot: 3
Characters: 3
Animation: 5
Music: 2

4659151,4,B005DEUEOU,"The first time I watched Gemini of the Meteor online I had mixed feelings about it.  I love season one of Darker Than Black.  I was expecting more greatness from season two but felt underwhelmed and confused.  However, after watching season two of Darker Than Black in blu-ray, my opinion has improved.

I began by watching the OVA's, which are the perfect link to transfer from season one to two.  The beginning of Gemini of the Meteor seems a bit hectic, but the OVA's put into context what is going on.  Without giving too much of the plot away, season 2 of Darker Than Black retains the same adrenaline, mysteries and strange humor from the first season.  If you like great-looking anime, this anime will be a feast for your eyes.

If you are a fan of the first season of Darker Than Black, get this set.  I am giving Gemini of the Meteor four stars because the story/plot is not as great as season one.
