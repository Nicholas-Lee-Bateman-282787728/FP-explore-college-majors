2534572,5,B000EU1Q68,"My 2-1/2 year old daughter has developed a recent interest in the Berenstain Bears.  I remembered that we had an old video of them and we took out some library books too and I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the video and books included some inappropriate, obnoxious behavior.  I decided to search for a newer Bears DVD in hopes that it would be more pleasant and this DVD surely did not disappoint.  The episodes are all very cute and focus on the importance of family.",1218585600,3,478,4.534883720930233
2534573,4,B000EU1Q68,"We bought this DVD and ""The Berenstain Bears - Discover School"" to complement the bedtime books in our sons' bookshelf.

This DVD nicely complements The Berenstain Bears bedtime books we've enjoyed for years. Our two sons - ages 5 and 4 - enjoy the stories while learning important lessons, like good hygiene and polite manners.

This DVD has six episodes:

Week at Grandma's
Go to the Movies
Attic Treasure
Bears for all Seasons
Mama's New Job
The Big Red Kite

Each episode is about 10 minutes long - the entire DVD runs 82 minutes. The animation matches the books. The voice acting is solid. Overall, this is a nice addition to your Berenstain Bears collection of books and DVDs.",1218240000,30,682,4.705882352941177
2534574,5,B000EU1Q68,"My little boy loves Berenstain Bears! The stories are great and always teach a good lesson.
The movies are great for the imagination because they take you away to another world, where
 Bears live like people in their own special way. Each DVD has six stories, so it is a lot of fun for the price.
My little boy has the whole collection! He has been watching them since before he was two! I know he will watch them for many years to come and then I will save them for Grandchildren! We read every day and do all kinds of creative things and I feel that Berenstain Bears is an excellent addition to our repertoire.",1203984000,5,612,4.275862068965517

8114392,5,B000EU1Q68,"This DVD is one of the old videos that teach family values and has none of the irreverent, rude behavior in some of the Berenstain ""cartoons"" on TV. It teaches a fun lesson about having a good time as a family even when your adventure plans do NOT work out. You will enjoy it, as well as your kids. (We wish it had a ""play continuously"" option, tho!)",1247443200,3,350,4.161764705882353
