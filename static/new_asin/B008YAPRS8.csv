5190553,5,B008YAPRS8,"My whole family waited for this movie to come out in theaters, and we ALL loved it!  Besides being a great underdog-wins-out sports flick, this movie touches on a lot of other important topics as well, including the rights and heritage of Indigenous Peoples, class rivalries, and personal honor and responsibility, and it does so without an overbearing or moralizing feel.  There are a few tongue-in-cheek jokes that only true laxxers are likely to get, and a lot more humor for everyone else to share.  A must-see for all youth lacrosse players, this movie is a treasure for the entire family.  Spread the game!",1347494400,20,612,4.855769230769231
5190554,5,B008YAPRS8,"Crooked Arrows takes the oft used Mighty Ducks style of sports movie to another level.  The overall skeleton of the story is what you would expect.  Misfit team thrown together with unpopular, unmotivated coach manages to come together to win in the end.  It is how the journey takes place that sets this film apart.  Crooked Arrows delves into the rich history of lacrosse and native American culture.  The history and philosophy is both accurate and respectful.  The theme of the movie is ""respect the game,"" and Crooked Arrows does just that.

Through all this, the comedic timing of these athletes is impeccable.  As with Miracle, it would have been much more difficult to teach actors to play lacrosse than to teach lacrosse players to act, so that's the way they went.  As a result, the lacrosse action is both accurate and spectacular.  They brought in the same sports photography experts that created the intense action of Miracle to recreate that here.  You will feel like you are on the field with these players!  Throw in a few cameos from lacrosse greats, and you have a perfect movie.

As a former player and current coach, I cannot recommend this movie more highly!",1345680000,37,1179,4.7772277227722775

5190557,5,B008YAPRS8,A fun movie for any young lacrosse player.  Many known lacrosse players are featured in this film. They went with few actors and real lacrosse coaches and players.  I appreciate seeing the Thompson brothers and many great Iroquois players.,1497571200,,239,5.102564102564102

5190560,4,B008YAPRS8,"Great little film about a ragtag high school lacrosse team that eventually, with the help of a new coach, tap into their Native American heritage as those who introduced the game and go on to win the nationals.  Most interesting was how the film deftly switches between the current uniformed generation playing within boundaries and their ancestors playing the game.unfettered through the woods and in an open field.  The mostly Native American cast did an excellent job of making you believe in them.",1493510400,,501,5.024096385542169
5190561,5,B008YAPRS8,"pleasantly surprised what a fun movie and the way it brings in the cultural aspects of the game really inspired my 9 year old, we all enjoyed the movie and will for years to come.  If you have a little LAX'r this is a must see, only a few language issues that may raise conversations but if you allow PG13 nothing to concern yourself with.  You will have to have a conversation that no team actually shoots that many BTB shots and wins though, as well as the poor technique, but hey its a fun movie and who uses movies to teach kids anyways?

Recommended to any LAX players and family wanting to see a very surface level of what the Creators Game is, watch for the snide comments from the Coventry fans disrespecting the Indians, smack down to ensue!",1489622400,,750,4.3428571428571425

5190657,5,B008YAPRS8,"Exhaustive reviews of this film's various aspects are already posted, and I agree with those extolling the action and heart of the movie even if the acting and writing aren't always A+. I would simply add that the opening sequence, featuring American Indian athletes locked in a desperate chase through the forest (the lacrosse field of yesteryear), was without doubt the most breathtaking sports action I've ever seen on film. For some reason it hit me on a visceral level and struck an ancient chord deep within that brought tears to the eyes--something entirely uncharacteristic, virtually alien to this moviegoer. I was just glad to be one of only two people in the cinema for this matinee, so I wouldn't be detected blubbering like a schoolgirl at just how overwhelmingly COOL this opening footage is. I was so glad they plunged directly into it right off the bat too, gripping viewers by the throat and forcing them to watch wide-eyed, instead of building up to it in some kind of introspective, sappy way. I went back to see it twice more just to be sure, and it was still equally awesome, though I was ready for it and somewhat more in control. The producers and directors took painstaking steps to ensure everything about the sport and its traditions was depicted with the utmost accuracy achievable. Those new to the game will be surprised to learn the Indians call it both the Medicine Game for its healing properties and the Creator's Game in the belief that lacrosse is God's gift to the American Indian peoples, and that playing it with passion at the top of their skill level--regardless of winning or losing--is their gift back to the Creator. I'm not a player but a huge fan of this sport, the oldest in N. America (some sources say over 1000 years, others 2000). Seeing this movie no doubt has made instant fans of many viewers, with many more on the way. Tip: The professional game, Major League Lacrosse, features a 60-second shot clock that forces even MORE action at a breathless pace and more relentless attacking of the net than international, college or high school lacrosse.

Every American sports fan and history buff should see this movie to gain an appreciation for the Indians' creation of North America's indigenous sport.",1406332800,,2253,4.806701030927835

It is a nice, feel-good ""Disney-like"" movie that appeals to pre-teens ~ although our whole family enjoyed it.  I rated it as 4 stars because of some  language that I didn't feel was necessary.

While the format may be familiar, this movie has a unusual twist.  It's about a Native American lacrosse team overcoming coaching and motivational problems to understand the real heritage of the sport.
Lacrosse was invented by Native Americans hundreds of years ago.  Now it has been usurped by white kids going to elitist prep schools. Natural ""bad guys"" for the films.

The audio and video quality of this blu ray disc was outstanding.  You can buy the soundtrack which is spectacular from Perseverence Records.",1380672000,3,468,4.89873417721519

It is a great movie to show to a group a students when talking about how many Native American tribes have lost touch with a lot of their culture through the years. This movie also touches on the subject of gaming which many Native American tribes have resorted to as a means to help sustain their tribes, but at what cost?  The game of Lacrosse in this movie relates to the game of Stick Ball.  This is a game that many Native American tribes have played for 100's of years and is how the game of Lacrosse actually came to be.  It is a great movie.  It does contain a few curse words, but these are very minimal.",1379548800,,632,4.147540983606557

Of course, she had to have it once it was released on DVD! It's a fun movie. Don't expect a true blue lacrosse movie - as always, things aren't as they should be (some of the hits are definite penalties!), but it's a feel good, laugh and really get into the characters flick.

5190686,4,B008YAPRS8,"The film starts with a fantastic scene of what looks like a pursuit, but you soon learn it's a game. It's the lacrosse game as it was ritually played by Iroquois people in the centuries past to honour the Creator, who gave the game to the people.
It drew me right in, and I think this is the difference between this film and so many others about sport and coming of age and finding yourself that you can find out there.

Yes, because on the outside, this film is not very different from many others that came before and others that will surely come after this one. We have a mismatched team that always loses. We have a reluctant coach - trapped in the position and with a shady past - that slowly learns to appreciate other people as well as himself. We have a lot of characters funny and less so. I can't honestly say I've never seen anything like this.
But I can, and I will say, that the take of this film to this well-known theme is quite unique.

The lacrosse itself is a sport that is not often seen on screen. The setting is an Indian reservation (of the fictional nation of Senequois, member of the very real Iroquois Confederacy). And especially the way the theme is played - inside the Iroquois belief that the sport is not merely a game, but it's a way to healing people and places - is something that I don't think I've ever seen in sport films and that I thoroughly enjoyed and found very meaningful.

The scenes of actual played game are very good and involving. The guys are actual lacrosse players from different Iroquois nations, and this adds to the personality of this film.

A very enjoyable show.",1374451200,7,1618,4.383333333333334

5190691,3,B008YAPRS8,"Very predictable and far fetched. The transformation of the team happened way too fast, and why? Just because they learned a few Indian words? The best part of the movie was when the woman asked, ""When did Indians start playing Lacrosse?"" One error occurred when it was said that the Ancients didn't keep score. Some Choctaw stickball games could last for days because they sometimes played to 100. It the team had become a powerhouse over two or three seasons it would have been more believable. And maybe some real coaching?",1374019200,,526,4.791208791208791

5190703,4,B008YAPRS8,"I really enjoyed this movie displaying a native sport and a team learning pride, and traditions in respecting native culture. From also how one can be lost and not fully understand the history behind the sport also provides them a link back to continuing passing down  part of native cultural history. A history that is not written but passed on to another generation. While also in the movie I like how the coach accepts and becomes closer to his ancestors in understanding a full spectrum in theirs more to just playing the sport. As the team itself gains confidence but also learns the history behind the sport helps improve their skills in becoming not only a better team but person as well including the coach.

5190720,5,B008YAPRS8,"I really enjoyed this film. I loved playing Lacrosse growing up in Canada, and it was really fantastic to see the historical story and spiritual strength portrayed through the film in it's telling. Lacrosse is more than a sport, it is a sacred dance of the spirit of the player with all that has been created, and ever will be created. Not ""a game"", but a connection to human intention and choice. This cultural cornerstone, how to shape it's principles of self guidance and self cultivation into a story, pleasing to any audience could have been a challenging undertaking for any storyteller - particularly a filmmaker. The filmmakers, actors and players created a shared group experience, which, we the audience get to share with them every step of their journey of deepening connection. Watching the film, I enjoyed every minute, I could sense the joy of each person participating in the film - and knew I was going to be taken somewhere special by the conclusion of the film. The film got better every moment of the viewing, a rare experience in any film. Thank you so much for being inclusive of elders, youth, honouring treaty rights, honouring the land, respecting women, pointing out the soul demeaning aspects of commercial gimmicks which can belittle culture and women ... for the sake of drawing a crowd into a casino. When I think of all the pertinent and timely subjects touched on in the telling of this story, my list grows longer on why everyone should see this film. Aside from the historical, cultural and political reasons to see this film, the film is simply a really fun and enjoyable experience. It is a great gift for anyone. I have already lent it out to several friends who as recent immigrants, can benefit from being touched in their hearts by the sacred history of their new chosen land of residence. The final round dance by the gathering of the nation to support the players is wonderful. The end credit clips sequence of the actors and players enjoying each other's company is brillant to include ... it shows that acting is acting, and today's generation can choose to meet on an equal playing field of their own creation - gifting respect and equality of all human beings. Thanks for this film, to all who were involved in it's shaping, portrayal and telling of it's story. Loved it.",1361491200,,2316,4.735148514851486

5190734,5,B008YAPRS8,"Let's face it, sports movies are corny and feature a lot of cliches.  This one is no exception, but it will still be enjoyable to players and fans of lacrosse as well as those who are just looking for a feel-good story.  I think they did a masterful job of weaving the origins of the game into the plot, and unlike a lot of sports films the action on the field is relatively realistic.  Some of the cameos from big names in the sport are a little forced, but that's easy to forgive because the regular cast is very likable.  If you are a lacrosse player or fan, this movie is not to be missed.  You'll want to watch it more than once.  If you're not into lacrosse but are just looking for a movie that the whole family will enjoy, this is still your ticket.  You'll like the story and will be impressed by the skill of the players too.",1359244800,,835,4.149068322981367

the big screen in 2012. The one and only motion picture to capture the historical and cultural aspects of this ancient
tribal game will leave the viewer(s) cheering from their home couch. The mostly American Indian cast, which includes actual young native Lacrosse players, will warm the viewer's heart as the cultural presence winds its way through this feel-good story. This motion picture arrives at a time when the game of Lacrosse is becoming the fastest growing sport in the country.

I like the way the Indians identified the roots of the game as a game they played to honor their Creator. Winning and losing are secondary. But you play your best. It has a different tone to the game that young kids need at this age so they don't become little machines driven to always win but a person with a heart who plays with heart -- win or lose.

The best part of this movie is how it shows the importance of the sport of lacrosse in the Native American culture, the worst part is the over-all plot of the story which is highly predictable. If you are a lacrosse player you should probably buy it (in particular if you know nothing about the sports' background). If you want a movie which is more entertaining, purchase ""Warrior's Heart"" which touches the same subject matter to some degree. If you want a very interesting dvd dealing with lacrosse, purchase the ""Morgan Lacrosse"" documentary ( very good true story).",1354406400,,747,4.666666666666667

5190777,5,B008YAPRS8,"The way the story is told, about a sport established LONG before any Spanish, French, or other non-indigenous peoples stepped foot on this continent makes this film have a richness grounded in a tradition most of us have no clue about.
Beautiful in it's simplicity.  Rich in it's uniqueness.  Unless the day comes that someone makes a LaCrosse movie on a Res by a native, with only natives in it, you will not get a more inside view of where the sport comes from, and how unique the culture behind it is.
Anyone cynical enough to call this a ""typical feelgood movie"" needs to examine themselves.  There is nothing typical about this movie.
There are not enough movies told from the native viewpoint.  That in itself makes this movie out of the norm.  I am NOT a Native American, but it sure is something worth wishing for.",1353888000,11,822,4.5646258503401365

It also brings historical information about the true beginnings of La Crosse.  So much of Native American history has been Americanized and taken away from the Native people.

One negative for me was the stereotypical Native characters.  For example, every word out of the tribal elder's mouth was some sacred gem of wisdom.  That got kind of sickening after a while.  My daughter was an extra in the film, which was the main reason we watched it.

You won't see great acting, or an original storyline, but its heartwarming, and nice to see the Native American focus. One line, delivered as the Crooked Arrows team begins to play well against the dominant prep school team is sad and funny at the same time: ""Since when did the Native Americans start playing lacrosse anyway?""  It's nice to have a big time movie for a great sport, and for that I'm grateful, and I plan to watch it often with my young grandson as he grows older.

5190788,5,B008YAPRS8,"All of us have times when we lose our spirit. What do you do to rediscover yourself and your drive? All of the team players and the coach had to make changes - both their physical routines and within themselves - in order to regain their spirit, drive and personal integrity.

I loved the line when - at one of the games - a yuppie with her fake blonde hair - turns to her friend and sneeringly says, ""When did the Indians start playing lacrosse, anyway?"" Obviously, she was implying this was NOT a game for Indians as they just didn't have the inborn skill for the game [for those who don't know, Lacrosse was created by Native Americans].

There is a legend that that one of the elders tells about the eagle who was the ruler of the sky. One day, while flying, he was struck down by an arrow. As the eagle lay dying, it noticed the arrow was fletched with its own feathers. The eagle had given its enemy the means for the eagle's own destruction.

How many times have we given others - even if it unknowingly done - the means for our own defeat? What are you willing to do change yourself to recover and move forward? It's a clean, inspirational family movie.

The background of making ""Crooked Arrows"" is also interesting:

5190790,3,B008YAPRS8,"I enjoyed this film, but I looked more for something that was missing in the area of indigenous culture about this sport. What is interesting and worth the time was the special features documentary short about the Onondaga peoples and lacrosse. To connect this short with the opening runners through the forest in the film would have been, in my mind, a greater success, but the attempt to connect one mans story with his rich culture and background just falls too short and shallow as the action scenes on the playing field are confined to the latter half of the movie. A former lacrosse star, self disgraced (Brandon Routh) from the Onondaga tribal reservation is running the casino complete with skimpy dressed non-native females and feathered headband, brings all the looney tune stereotypes to surface as mixed bloods are whats left of this culture as the full blooded native representation remains the minority in Gil Birmingham as Ben Logan, the father. Everyone from the main character (Routh), his daughter, the Yoda-like and all wise elderly matriarch, the medicine man and half the team, are mixed bloods portaying, to some success, an ancient sport ""for the creator"".
Why such a racial lens? Because films about native peoples have been historically geared to represent native culture through Anglo and non-native actors, directors, writers, producers and for non-native audiences appeal. Possibly sacrilege, feathers are not supposed to touch the ground or floor and most tribes do not hand out feathers that equate a school childs gold star for achievement. A handy bald eagle cameo does little to convince such spiritual powers This reminds me of the unending scream you always hear of an eagle or hawk in every film or western about native people from Gunsmoke to I predict, the upcoming ""Lone Ranger"" film with Johnny Depp. Also, by the films own admission, the lone white player on the team catches so much crap, why does he have to be the ""inept"" one of the team? How is this not racially targeting him? Add to this fact that the only person(s) speaking the language is the white school teacher. Even the elderly woman, the tribal council and the medicine man do not speak enough indiginous tongue to show the audience they are, in fact, native peoples. The film's director Steve Rash proves great technical aspects such as cinematography and richness of the color on this eastern native reserve, especially as the film guides towards the ending. Yet, what builds up and takes place during the acting, storyline and even the ethnic grasp of native life just proves too plastic and predictable.
The complete tribe showing up at the end of the game makes this film, in my mind, the perfect ""cheesy"" drama and I just didn't feel it.",1351641600,,2748,4.911827956989248
5190791,5,B008YAPRS8,"There appears to be enough potential backstories in this movie to develop a number of TV episodes involving these characters.  As an example, Julie Gifford's teaching adventures and other aspects of her very appealing character can be explored.

Extending further, storylines can be constructed to give the general public a better understanding of tribal government organizations and how they function along with the local, state and federal system.  Native customs, religion, history and legends can be presented.  I'd like to see flashbacks to how life was in past centuries and millenia.  And, of course, there can be a lot more lacrosse!  All these things mixed together with interesting characters - and character development - would make a great TV series which would never have any inclination or need to descend into cliches and stereotypes.",1351468800,,849,5.298507462686567

When a change is made in order to restore pride in the people Joe Logan (Routh) is assigned as the new coach. A former All-American player himself (although he hasn't played at all since missing the big shot) the school thinks they have the answer. First of all I will say that this is a good and entertaining movie. That said it took me a little more then halfway through before I realized why I was experiencing Deja-vu. The coach of the down-on-its-luck-rag-tag team used to be the star for the best team in the state. He missed the final shot of the season and is shunned. He starts off coaching for personal gain but begins to grow with the team and teaches them what being a team means. I could keep going on about it but what I'm getting at here is that this movie is almost a shot for shot remake of ""Mighty Ducks"". This one deals with the history of lacrosse in the Native American culture and that part is interesting and the movie is entertaining but don't expect anything original. Overall, a fun movie to watch as a family. I give it a B-.",1350345600,,1228,4.438053097345133
5190794,5,B008YAPRS8,"The name of the movie intrigued me. As the movie opened and I saw Native American Indians of 1000 years ago playing a challenging game of lacrosse, I wondered where this movie was going to in the story. I was pleased and found such substance in the story and the characters as the plot continued into the present day.

The main character had become worldly and forgot his heritage,honor to his people and tradition. As the story progresses you see him regain these principles and instill them in the high school lacrosse team he coaches. Crooked Arrows becomes the name of the team and the young men eventually defeat the team which has been on the top for many years. It is through hard work, deciding that the honor of their pride of their Native American heritage,teamwork, and commitment that the team is able to pull through to their victory.

The challenge of this team does not go unnoticed by the town and the other Native American people in the surrounding areas as they cheer on the young men in the finals of the lacrosse match. The coach even defeats a developer who tries to take over the land for development.

You will delight in the characters and their progress as their relationships become richer throughout the movie

The movie is rated PG, but for your older children, teenagers, especially those in sports, I feel this is a good family movie. The scenes during the lacrosse games are rough.",1350172800,2,1412,4.658634538152611
