8603406,3,B00EB4HTSW,"This is an okay, albeit very generic, swashbuckler if you don't mind the mostly badly dubbed Italian actors and a very over the hill Anthony Steel as the ""young"" male hero; however the video quality is criminally bad.  It's obviously  a widescreen film that being shown full screen and for a good portion of the film up to a third of the picture is missing, heads are chopped off, etc.  Given that thiis is not a real cheap DVD, I think it's inexcusable and that the people who peddle this crap have no respect for cinema or their customers.  It also points up how Amazon often sells DVDs without any internal quality control at all so I think they, also, are culpable here.  Don't waste your money unless  you don't care about the quality of the video itself.  IF the film was ever released in a proper  widescreen format at a decent price, the film itself is okay for lovers of pirates films, like myself, who happily revert to childhood whenever they hear two swords clang.  Otherwise, it's a definite miss.",1401926400,,1010,4.535911602209945
