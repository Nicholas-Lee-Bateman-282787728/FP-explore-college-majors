It uses recycled footage, it uses an Israeli Kfir fighter as the 'secret' fighter, it has bad acting, and so many other reasons why its crap.",980726400,2,315,4.266666666666667
8450796,4,6305019037,i've been a fan of Michael Dudikoff ever since i saw American Ninja and have watched his acting evolve.  would love to see him in more films that has the potential for box office hits.,925084800,3,184,4.257142857142857
