8412220,4,B004089RMU,"Back in 2006, I went up to take part in the 145th First Manassas Battle Reenactment at the Cedar Creek Battlefield near Middletown, Virginia. Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to stay for the battle. However, with the Confederate Pictures film, I was able to see what I missed. Overall, this is a good video of the 1st Manassas event. There are a couple of distractions, however. First, one piece of footage is replayed right after seeing it the first time. Secondly, the occasional appearance of another camera man running past the screen really takes away from the authentic feel of the rest of the reenactment footage. Those problems aside, the footage of the event is good overall. If you took part in this event, or missed the battle altogether, then you'll want this video in your collection.
