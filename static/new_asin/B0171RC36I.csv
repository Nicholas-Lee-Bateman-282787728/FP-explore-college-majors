7486240,5,B0171RC36I,"My dad received this as a Christmas gift, and I watched it with him. What an amazingly informative documentary about the Creature From the Black Lagoon. My father is a huge fan of this type of material and genre of movie and has a wide knowledge. He really enjoyed the film and the Special Features. In response to one reviewer that stated David Skal's film is better, my dad thought this was strange, because while he enjoyed that other film, it was basically a 45-minute Special Feature on the original DVD (released what, 20 years ago?) This is 29 minutes longer, feature-length and seems like the most informative documentary about this character ever made. It's got Oscar-Winner Benicio Del Toro, who pines about his love for the Creature and is narrated by 2-time Emmy-Winner Keith David, who won his trophies for narrating Ken Burns' documentaries! Even my father and friend, who are large fans of the genre, said they learned several new things from the doc. Wait until the end for a tribute to the old Universal Films (fans of the genre will TOTALLY get it!) and for a special Ben Chapman tribute as an easter egg after the credits! Also, my disc showed no problems and I would highly recommend this film for not only CFTBL fans, but fans of the horror genre in general. I also think filmmakers would really enjoy the history presented within.",1455926400,3,1352,4.708860759493671
7486241,5,B0171RC36I,"What a fine tribute to a film that thrilled and delighted a generation of Monster Kids--something CFTBL continues to do today!  The nostalgia factor of this collection of Creature sights and sounds is huge, and the information is spot-on.  60 YEARS OF THE GILL-MAN is a treasure trove of CFTBL history.  Many years ago when I first met Ben Chapman, ""the land-creature"", at a convention, he made me laugh (Ben made EVERYbody laugh!) when I chose a couple photos for him to sign for me.  Longtime Ben-fans will recognize this: Ben said, ""Hang on!  I'm gonna give ya a copy of an article about me, and I'm gonna give ya a copy of my contract, and I'm gonna give ya a ""Creature buck"", and I've gotta sign 'em all--and then you can get yourself a frame--and put the pictures like THIS and the contract like THIS and these things like THIS---and THEN ya GOT somethin'!,""  He spread his hands in a big ta-DAAAH gesture, a huge grin on his face.  That's the feeling CREATURE FEATURE: 60 YEARS OF THE GILL MAN give me.  With this DVD, we have it all placed before us--sixty years of CFTBL fun--and NOW, we've surely GOT somethin' WONDERFUL!  I'm sure Ben would be pleased.",1455840000,2,1163,4.526315789473684
7486242,5,B0171RC36I,"This documentary delves not only into the making of the original film ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", but its legacy- sequels, merchandise, die-hard fans, and its influence on other films.

It is narrated by one of the all-time greats in his profession, Keith David. As usual, he knocks it out of the park. Among those interviewed for the documentary are stars land gill-man Ben Chapman & Julia Adams, and well-known fans of the film such as Daniel Roebuck (""Matlock"") and Academy Award winning Benecio Del Toro (""Traffic""). You can tell the passion that the stars & fans of the film still have, 60+ years after its release.

I watched this documentary on the recently released Blu-ray edition, and it was cool to see some extra features that tie into the documentary itself, such as an Abbott & Costello skit from the Colgate Comedy Hour.

I'd highly recommend this film to any fan of the Universal monsters, monsters in general, or science fiction classics.",1455753600,5,961,4.883435582822086
7486243,2,B0171RC36I,"I borrowed a friend's copy. The story of the making of the movie, which we've all read or heard 299 times, is told for the 300th. I learned nothing. Benicio del Toro talks slowly and in a childlike way, saying nothing, as if he just woke up and isn't fully awake yet. Fans I never heard of talk and talk about where they saw the movie for the first time and why they like it ... sheer boredom. I turned it off long before the end. I click on the names of Amazon reviewers giving it positive reviews and I see that this is their first, last and only Amazon review ever, which makes me wonder who they really are (i.e., if they aren't the people who made this doc). All the bad reviews ARE from people with Amazon reviewing histories. If you've got Universal's CREATURE doc by David Skal, you're good to go. This is Amateur Night on the Amazon.",1455753600,2,842,4.236024844720497
7486244,4,B0171RC36I,"This feature-length documentary about our favorite film Creature is a must-have for classic Universal cinephiles!  Narrated by Keith David and featuring numerous greats like Benicio Del Toro, along with original cast members Ben Chapman and Julie Adams, this film takes us on an extensive journey, beginning with the inception and creation of ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" carrying us all the way through to the biggest modern day fan conventions, monster collectors, and more!

Regarding the quality of the disc (I have the Blu-Ray), my Dad and I were able to seamlessly play the entire feature and all the bonus materials without any problems whatsoever.

Creature Feature: 60 Years of the Gill-Man is a unique treasure, made by movie nerds FOR movie nerds.  Hope youll take the opportunity to enjoy this nostalgic trip down Monster Lane!",1455580800,2,848,5.1678832116788325

7486246,1,B0171RC36I,"The item description includes a feature of the hour-long Colgate episode.  The Blu-Ray I received had that on the menu, but it would not actually play. I tried on multiple BR players, every one failed.  I contacted the Facebook page for this title. They said they didn't do the authoring, and that I probably received a bad copy. They suggested I do a return/swap. I did.  The replacement disc performed in exactly the same way.  All other listed features do play, but the Colgate episode does not.

Though this is a Blu-Ray, the documentary is NOT in high definition.

Also note, though it is not mentioned anywhere in the listing, this is a MOD - manufacture on demand. In other words, it's just a burned disc. That information should have been noted in the listing.",1454284800,3,768,4.651851851851852

7486248,4,B0171RC36I,"This is for the those who are into creature flix and used to watch classic monster films on late night TV and on MST 3000.  I remember when the original Creature From The Black Lagoon came out and the stir it caused.  What I didn't know is the back story, which is the strong point of this video.  It is fascinating how the Creature was conceived, the Creature suit was made, and the Creature movies were written and cast.  As the video points out, the Creature, aka the ""Gill-Man,"" made a lasting impression on pop culture and has many celebrity followers.",1449014400,3,557,4.485148514851486
7486249,1,B0171RC36I,"Item arrived without the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon 60th Anniversary Booklet by Scott Essman"" as specified on the Blu-Ray back cover. This was to be a physical item, not a special feature on the disc. I returned the disc and will reorder if or when the booklet is ever added to the package as advertised.",1447459200,4,309,4.535714285714286
8737868,5,B0171RC36I,Received the creature DVD very fast. Watched it and the extras. Enjoyed every minute of it. Very good documentary on the creature. One of my favorite Universal monsters. Highly recommended,1506470400,,188,5.3

8737871,5,B0171RC36I,One of my favorite monster characters from the Universal legacy. I had the pleasure of knowing Ben Chapman up till his passing. This film is a true homage to a fantastic monster and to see all who got involved is wonderful. A true gem.,1480636800,3,235,4.363636363636363
8737872,4,B0171RC36I,"I'm normally not one for documentaries, but i must say that this documentary on the evolution of the Gillman/Creature of from the black lagoon did capture my attention. It was very enlightening and informative. It highlighted the evolution from idea/inception of the Gillman through the construction process and into the reality and filming. It shed a new light on the involvement and dedication and efforts it took to put together a feature of this magnitude. I would recommend this docu to any one interested in the horror genre of yesteryear",1476576000,3,544,5.055555555555555
8737873,1,B0171RC36I,"What a disappointment! All the interviews were from 10 years ago when they were trying to release ""50 years"". The fans segment was so boring and just filler. Learned nothing from this. The ""extras"" were junk. The Colgate Comedy clip can be seen in HD on YouTube. And I received no advertised booklet!!!! Save your cash!",1471392000,2,319,4.714285714285714
8737874,5,B0171RC36I,I was very pleased with DVD. The quality was excellent and the arrival time was right on time.,1464566400,,94,4.277777777777778
8737875,4,B0171RC36I,"This is a roughly 75 minute documentary covering the entire Creature from the Black Lagoon film series and it's impact on pop culture. I remember hearing about this documentary in 2008 and wondering when it was coming out on DVD (later blu-ray) and now here it is. The documentary has interviews with the late Ben Chapman, Julie Adams, screenwriter the late Arthur Ross, along with several fans including Academy Award Winner Benicio del Toro. The first film, and arguably the most famous and most well-done, gets the most attention here which is expected. Revenge of the Creature (1995) and Creature Walks Among Us (1956) get glossed over and then the documentary moves on to the Gill-Man's enduring legacy. Overall, I would say I enjoyed this documentary but if you have seen Universal's Back to the Black Lagoon documentary which came with the Creature legacy DVD set then you are unlikely to learn any new information. If you are a fan of the Universal Monsters, especially the Gill-Man, I would definitely recommend buying this documentary as it is fair-priced and unlikely to disappoint hardcore fans.",1461801600,4,1107,5.021739130434782
8737876,5,B0171RC36I,"Really enjoyed viewing this. It brought back a lot of pleasant memories of when I viewed the creature series back in the very early 1960's for the first time on commercial television. Very informative and interesting in reference to the ""behind the scenes"" making of the films, the various interviews, and the effort that was put into producing the series itself. Would enjoy seeing a remake of ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" although I'm sure that nothing would be able to top the original.....",1458604800,3,501,4.905882352941177
8737877,5,B0171RC36I,"If you are a fan of the Creature or a Monster Kid, this is a must own DVD to have in your collection!  This DVD gives you the history of films, the design of one of the most amazing suits in the history of monsters and a glimpse of the collections of some of the larger Creature collectors.  Keith David brilliantly narrates the documentary, interviews with Benecio DelToro, Daniel Roebuck, along with comments from some of the Creature stars(Ben Chapman and Julie Adams) highlight the documentary.  Also shown is the Creatures early appearance with Abbott and Costello!",1456531200,2,570,4.855670103092783
