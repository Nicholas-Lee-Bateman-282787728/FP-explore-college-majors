5086947,4,B007HLUABY,"This MET HD production really deserves to be seen on blu-ray. The sets are fabulous and the acting by the cast very fine indeed.
In the titlerole as the trovatore is Alvarez, with a suave tenor that really is more aptly deployed in more lyrical roles. The voice is very good but on the whole lacking in the requisite squillo. Otherwise, a very fine Manrico.
As his lady Leonora, Sondra Radvanovsky displays a wonderfully large tone: bright and shimmering most of the time, cutting through the thick orchestration with ease. That said, her control over her voice is however not complete, and the high light aria d'amor sull'ali rosee is less than ideal. Otherwise, her summptuous tone is a real joy to listen, but she does demonstrate a tendency to go out of character during applauses, which is distracting to viewers on screen, if not in the operahouse.
The real gems of this performance, and hence making it a four-star DVD, are the lower voices - Fernando, Azucena and Count di Luna, none other than Stefan Koc&aacute;n, Dolora Zajick and Dmitri Hvorostovsky.
Stefan Koc&aacute;n is perhaps an upstaging and powerful bass, if not for Hvorostovsky's ultra-fine reprisal of di Luna. Since his ROH DVD of the same role, the Russian baritone has gained more insights over the decade, and lost none of the stamina and vocal finesse for this Verdian baritone role.
Dolora Zajick is probably the best Azucena currently, singing with a beautifully plangent and expressive Verdian mezzo-soprano. She looks every inch the part, and acts with admirable affectation.
The orchestra is wonderfully conducted by Armiliato at the pit.
This Il Trovatore is recommended over the ROH earlier release, even if for the same Hvorostovsky.",1342396800,,1719,5.013986013986014

8516697,2,B007HLUABY,"I wish someone had told me that this was so objectionable for anyone with any morals at all to watch.  There is no rating system, so I had hoped this would be played out in a traditional, romantic and passionate way, but alas....it is just trashy and cheap.  One scene was so nasty, that we had to turn it off and never watched beyond that point.",1412899200,3,346,4.2272727272727275
8516698,4,B007HLUABY,"The original basic plot has some less than credible events, but this new version does a good job of it. It is a somewhat more modern version and both acting and singing are of a high standard. I consider this to be the best version available",1407628800,,241,4.260869565217392
8516699,5,B007HLUABY,"I'm an opera rookie-- I own ten copies of six operas and have two more I taped from PBS.

This should not be the first one you buy, but would be a great 4th or 5th pick.

Horovotsky is great- all the people are great. Picture is superb as is the stagecraft.

I'm watching Moby Dick tonight on TV, but will give this another spin next weekend--if I want peace in the house I can't watch too many operas.

Buy this-- it's great,",1383264000,,426,4.096385542168675
8516700,5,B007HLUABY,"It is truly a pleasure to review this Met disc of the old favorite opera, Il Trovatore. I saw it as a live from the Met and so hoped it would be released on Blu-ray. The adage that Caruso said ""to put on Trovatore you need the four greatest singers in the world"" is certainly close in this recording. As the Count, Hvorostovsky all but steals the show. He is in this disc more suave than in his first recorded di Luna done at the Royal Opera House in 2002. He now has the right squillo of a real Verdi baritone. It brings to mind the greatest person I've seen in that role, Leonard Warren. Dmitri is wonderful; much more satisfying performer than the dozen or so stiff Counts I've seen of Sherrill Milnes that I've witnessed over the years. Dmitri now owns this role as far as I'm concerned.
The Azucena of Delora Zajick is legendary. When she does ""Stride la vampa"" you can see the flames.  She looks the disheveled, weird old gypsy that has lived barefoot all her life. A new Azucena on the horizon is the Yvonne Naef of the Royal Opera House recording. Her voice is even more penetrating.
Having grown up with Zinka Milanov on every other Saturday matinee chewing up the scenery, its nice to hear a civil and refined approach to the role of Leonora. Sondra Radvanovsky is a wonder. Her ""Tacea la note placida"" was meltingly sweet. Her agility with the high register was ravishing; shimmering sound with pure tonal quality and she was in control. She did quite well in the acting also; a truly professional performer.
Marcelo Alvarez as Manrico gave a fine vocal performance and acted exceedingly well. He was virile yet refined; we could imagine him a knight in shining (black) armor. He is Argentinian but sounds like a born-in-Italy Verdi tenor. He acts well, looks good and we can see why Leonora could fantasize over him.
I've heard many operas conducted by Marco Armiliato. He knows what he is doing in keeping the orchestra under firm control but also allowing some leverage for the singers. This is a thoroughly engaging performance that will be played many times",1372204800,8,2073,4.587601078167116
8516701,4,B007HLUABY,"The plot of this opera is so convoluted or ridiculous, that Verdi and his librettist left very little action in the libretto itself. We only learn about it by the protagonists telling us what happened. As a result, most of the scenes are intimate and emotional ones.  McVicar production reflects exactly that. The staging is elaborate, but most of it serves only as a dark background to the emotions expressed in the lyrics and the music. The light on the protagonists contrasted against a darker background allows us to concentrate on them and their emotions through their acting, lyrics and mostly through their music. I found the image captures very good. Hvorostovsky famous white hair always makes for a great photograph.
The singers are exceptional, a great pleasure to listen to them and to watch them. A real treat.
I said ""almost perfect"" because there are obvious issues with the microphones.  As the singers move around the change in sound capture is too evident.  In a live broadcasting it can be acceptable since it is what it is at that moment, but when a recording is processed it should be corrected so it is not so noticeable. A singer's head movement should not cause such a big volume difference in a good quality recording.
Still, the music performance of the orchestra and the singers is just wonderful.",1371513600,,1324,4.823788546255507

Excellent production, Very good singing and perfect sound recording. I gave it five stars because I totally liked it. Rene Cabache",1357430400,,154,5.416666666666667
8516703,3,B007HLUABY,"I have seen more own goals by the Met than any other Blu-ray disc producer and here is another. With some minor reservations this is beautifully sung and the sound recording is excellent. The production is unlikely to upset traditionalists in its concept but the whole thing is ruined by the gloomy colours and low lighting that pervades everything. Met broadcasts and in-cinema showings have a tendancy to be far too dark and I no longer follow them because of this. I hoped that Blu-ray might get a better showing but sadly no. The picture quality is not even as good as a regular DVD. It is lamentable and the poor camera men have no chance to deliver a sharp and colourful image. There is no excuse for this and I fear very much that the forthcoming new Ring will be ruined in the same way. I have often wondered if the Met do it deliberately to discourage pirating but surely not. On the other hand why can they so rarely if ever offer sharp clear images to go with the drama and the music? Their recent Fanciulla that otherwise I enjoyed very much was also unnecessarily dark and gloomy. Another own goal is the quite dreadful introduction by Rene Fleming. Great singer she may be but she is no video compere and the cheesy interludes she provides made me cringe. They are not subtitled and several of the parties have accents that are very hard to follow. They can be avoided by using the controls but why should we have to do that? No other opera house intrudes on its repeat audiences in such an inconsiderate way.
I found this a deeply disappointing and even infuriating release. What a shame as the sound is terrific.",1345507200,12,1628,4.503378378378378
