8077963,5,B000ADKWJG,Love this series! Very fluffy and fun - maybe one day I'll collect the real series once it's over. X3,1413072000,,101,4.1
8077964,3,B000ADKWJG,"I got this because Netflix doesn't have it, so I have to buy it and than watch season three, so I would watch the whole series.",1369008000,,127,3.923076923076923
8077965,5,B000ADKWJG,"For those of you that like FMP, you'll love Fumoffu. It is pretty much just a high school love comedy. It's FMP minus the mecha and evil dudes. It's pretty over the top, but way fun. The animation is just as good if not a bit better, and the soundtrack is also great. In Fumoffu there are also some new and colorful characters introduced. We also get the pleasure of seeing new sides to some of the old ones. I simply love FMP Fumoffu and I hope you do too.",1353888000,,457,4.088888888888889
8077966,5,B000ADKWJG,"To begin with, it is definitely a very good show, something that I will explain later on.

Let us start with the outline of the story.

As the rest of the DVDs, this one has three stories going on:

1) In the first episode Sousuke and Kaname will be assigned to help the rugby team to get back to the winner's road. The problem: The rugby team will behave more like poets (just brought up as an example, I have nothing against them)rather than being an actual rugby team (well, the ones who play this or a similar sport will understand what I mean when watching the shows). In order to help them Sousuke will isolate them for a week somewhere in the mountains and give them the proper military `basic training'. Funny as hell. By the way, Sousuke will curse at the players like a lunatic but `bibs' will be heard all the time.

2) The second episode, is when Tessa (who appears only in this and in the next episode alongside with Mao and Kurz) decides during her vacations, because the sub needs repairs, to visit the school of Sousuke and Kaname `firing' the love triangle to new heights.

3) The third episode is one of the most talked about. Tessa decides to spend her final weekend in a hot spring. And guess what Mao and Kurz show up as university students (cover). Well, you can already imagine: The Men will give everything to see the naked bodies of the women and you will laugh with what they will come up. The only one standing between them: Sousuke. This show is extremely hilarious.

Overall, FMP Fumoffu concentrates more on the `ordinary school life' and on comedy, in contrast to FMP which balanced between comedy and action with Mechas. Nobody dies but it is funny as hell.

Additionally, the current series combine comedy, romance and action. As for the voices, either you hear it in Japanese or dubbed, both versions are very satisfying.

Last but not least, the price is the usual one that is charged for separated DVDs, in contrast to FMP 1st season that comes out in a box set and is much cheaper.

As a side note, the last FMP series that is out there is called FMP overload and currently available only on some other sides which for obvious reasons I cannot name here.

The final question:

Buying it or not?

Having watched all the series, my humble opinion would be: Yes and I highly recommend the shows.",1148428800,6,2329,4.479905437352246
8077967,5,B000ADKWJG,"I have to say out of the 4 volumes for FMPF Volume three is the funniest. I mean you have to watch it for yourself. The 1st episode starts off with Jindai High's Ruby team.....the team sucks so bad that the school was bout to ban it (How can you have a bunch of sensitive wimpy guys play on a ruby team anyway?) but Souske is tasked to beef up the squad to blood thirsty, cold hearted killers on the playing field.

Episode 8: Tessa takes a vacation to Jindai High to spend a lil quality time with souske but with him having orders to protect the  captain...the captain  almost puts him out of commision

Episode 9: The funniest of them all...I mean this episode has alot.......i mean Alot of eye candy for the guys i mean.......i wish that freakin lady bug was not it the way........but oh well...lol But the captain and crew takes a trip to the hot springs and well.....I guess...its natural for teenage boys but the fellas try to have a free sneak peak at the lovely ladies but souske sets up the whole park with booby traps....lol what till the end and i promise you.....YOU WILL BE LAUGHING YOUR HEART OUT!

I highly recomend (how ever you spell it) the series if you are a real fan and don't mind having major comedy of the FMP series

8077968,4,B000ADKWJG,"Sousuke and Chidori have been given an assignment by the student body president that they are not particularly suited for. They have to whip the school's rugby team into shape because if they lose their next game, the program will be dismantled. The problem lies in the fact that all the players are a bunch of sissies whose idea of a work-out is to laze around and water plants! Things are not going well until Sousuke institutes a military style training regimen, including tons of cuss-words that have to be censored for sensitive ears. After that, Sousuke has to deal with the arrival of his superior officer, who informs him that Captain Tessa is coming to stay at his apartment and will attend his school as she takes a vacation from Mithril. Of course, this is going to really get under Chidori's skin, especially because she won't admit she even likes Sousuke, and Tessa has a major league crush on our military nut. But just wait till you see the hilarity of that fan-service obligatory anime phenomena...the hot spring bath visit as a send-off to Tessa. With sex-crazed Kurtz and his arch-enemy Mao along for the trip, things are going to get ugly. Especially as Kurtz's main goal in life is to be a peeping tom!

This show is really funny. While the middle episode on this volume was pretty weak in terms of humor, the other two that bookend it were just great. The voice acting is superb and really makes you like the characters. This could have easily went the way of Excel Saga and bored the viewer, but it keeps up the laughs. The animation is also great, even though the show  is pretty domestic, there's still a lot of action.",1130025600,3,1643,4.585034013605442
8077969,5,B000ADKWJG,"The highlight of the 3rd volume of Full Metal Panic Fumoffu is the return of Captain Tessa for 2 episodes.  It's really a shame that she only appears in 2 episodes in this series.  Anyway, Tessa decides to use her vacation from the sub to attend Kaname's high school as an ""exchange student"".  In her first episode she shows up at Souske's apartment and enrolls at school.  In the second episode pretty much the whole cast goes to a Hot Springs, including Kurtz and Mao who also make an appearance.  The Hot Springs episode contains more fanservice than all the other episodes in the series combined!  In short, if you like Tessa, these 2 episodes might be your favorites of the enitre Fumoffu series.

Oh, there is another episode on this disk: Kaname and Souske try and turn the wimpy school Rugby team into tough guys so they can defeat their rivals and save the Rugby Club.  There is an incredible amount of foul language in this episode, a lot of it is bleeped out in both the Japanese and English versions, I'm not sure if it was aired originally with the naughty words or not, but it's not too hard to make out what Souske is saying.  It's a funny episode.

To summarize, if you like Tessa (like me) you'll wait in line to get this disk.  Lots of laughs and plenty of fanservice.",1126310400,7,1286,4.4297872340425535
