She Is VERY SEXY As Well. Buy The Movie For Some GREAT Surprises!! The New ""Pam Anderson"" Ment In The Very Best Of Ways! Way To Go Natasha!!!!",1320451200,2,227,4.428571428571429
4070067,5,B0035APGJ2,"This was a great movie. I enjoyed Natasha being so innocent and funny! Natasha narrates the entire movie, and for those of you who like beautiful women with foreign accents, this is a definite plus! Natasha comes across as very personable and sweet, and for those funny parts in the movie she's a very good sport! Also, we get to see her as a brunette and she has some great topless scenes, but don't let that be the only reason you order this DVD, it's a great story that's worth watching!",1315180800,,490,4.395604395604396
4070068,5,B0035APGJ2,I found this movie to be very entertaining. I think Natasha did a great job! I laughed and chuckled a lot! Natasha is quite talented (and lovely!). Funny and sexy!  The movie's story flowed very well and was easy to follow. All of the acting was well done in my opinion. I will definitely watch again and recommend this to others.,1312675200,,330,4.409836065573771
4070069,4,B0035APGJ2,"I liked the way the story flowed and the characters were just that! I enjoyed the concept the ""fish out of water"" appeal and all involved should be Proud of the efforts to bring this to life.",1309996800,,191,4.1891891891891895
4070070,5,B0035APGJ2,"Incredibly sexy; very well written. It's a great story of someone who may look like the typical bombshell model to everyone she comes across on the outside, but she's not stupid, she does achieve what she wants despite the crazy obstacles that get in her way. Again, very witty, you will laugh your ass off when you watch this. Please check this movie out. CLEVER!!!",1309996800,,366,4.6461538461538465
4070071,5,B0035APGJ2,"This is a great film. It shows the journey of a beautiful young woman who travels to america for a better life but she get more than she bargained for. America is nothing like her home, watch Natash adapt to her new life, learning that men are only after one thing and she can use her fantastic feminine form to get what she wants from them.
The Script is well written, the film is full of humour while exploring the more serious aspect of leaving your home and entire culture behind and having to fit in to a whole new world. Natasha is Funny, smart and oh so sexy. This film is worth the price just to see some of her revealing outfits. Some great camios from the adult industry.
Watch this film, it is fantastic and I hope there will be a sequal.

A very enjoyable movie.
Very good acting, writing, sound & filming.",1272844800,,112,4.65
4070073,5,B0035APGJ2,"Natasha Kizmet-The Movie shows the very shapely title character as she is introduced to the US and the sexually frustrated male status quo that all want to ""help"" her achieve her dream...as long as she'll help them fulfil their lusts. There are people there that try to help her on her way, and even with the ill-placed advice from her friend, coworkers, and bosses, she still manages to make her dream come true. Even when she has to take a couple steps back, doing degrading work because she's in a new and confusing world that wants her body while she wants to express her mind and talents, she still perseveres through all obsticles, proving to the end she's got a strong spirit and determination not to be messed with. Naive as she may be, she's not stupid, and learns how to handle herself in a world where men are ruled by their sexual desires and women have learned how to play those men to get what they want.",1264982400,,918,4.470238095238095
4070074,2,B0035APGJ2,I do not know why director launched this movie. I think it is uneventful and without especial scene. I did not like it,1375056000,,118,4.173913043478261
4070075,1,B0035APGJ2,It totally sucked she looked nothibg like the cover stor y waslwaslame not enough nudity for soft porn and too lame to be a b movie....,1374451200,3,135,4.230769230769231

4070077,2,B0035APGJ2,"That is a terrible movie to have on Prime Time! I am thinking about the teenagers who have Prime Time on their computers. They don't need to be exposed to this type of movie, they already know about these type of things! Amazon shouldn't encourage them with these types of movies!",1374019200,2,280,4.509803921568627
4070078,3,B0035APGJ2,"This move was interesting but in general I would never watch it again or ever recommend it, not for me",1372982400,,102,4.15
4070079,1,B0035APGJ2,"This movie was awful,cant believed i watched it thinking it would be like Borat...boring and not funny, save your time and skip it",1372032000,7,130,4.695652173913044
4070080,1,B0035APGJ2,"Once again I'm mystified by the high rating. It is NOT sexy and it is NOT funny. I'm not sure what it is. Natasha is a recent immigrant from a former Soviet country who thinks she is going to be a star as a belly dancer. She is ignorant and loses her money and can't keep a job, so she bleaches her hair fake blonde to match her huge, fake breasts and becomes a stripper. what a surprise. The rest of the movie, or what I saw, is her encounters with us stupid, sleazy Americans. If you like huge, FAKE boobs, and don't want to bother with any substance, this movie is for you. Unfortunately you junior high school boys aren't old enough to watch it.",1371945600,7,649,4.158730158730159
4070081,1,B0035APGJ2,"This movie makes "" Attack of the Killer Tomatoes "" look like Citizen Kane. So bad, it's awful. How can I get my 3.99 back from the cable company? I feel violated, and Natasha should feel ashamed, not just for being a CT, but for ripping people off with this movie. I'd call it crap, but crap has its uses.",1340496000,6,305,4.1
4070082,5,B0035APGJ2,"Definitely recommend to watch this movie. This is opportunity to see America as it sees a person, who came here to live and be a part of our country.",1339286400,,149,4.172413793103448
4070083,5,B0035APGJ2,Great movie! Not only is Natasha very beautiful the movie is really funny. You can tell everyone had fun making the film and that fact shines though. The movie has made me a fan and I hope she makes another. :),1327449600,,210,4.146341463414634
8388798,4,B0035APGJ2,"This movie is UNRATED, but would probably get an R-rating if it was rated.  The final scene is filmed at an eXXXotica porn convention in Miami.  There are bare breasts and sex toys in the movie.  However, there are no scenes with any bare bottoms.

Why was this movie given 5 stars by so many and only 1 star by others???  I guess it depends on your personal experience and how many other movies you have seen.

I give 4 out of 5 stars because this comedy movie has lots of different scenes.  If you like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Fran Drescher, then you will probably like Natasha Kismet.  All of them had black hair and wore high heels in their prime.  Natasha was supposedly born in 1980 and this movie released in 2010.  There are also other strippers to watch in this movie.  Natasha's breasts looked good to me, but the other stripper with very big breasts did look like implants.

NOTE: at the time of my review, this movie was an AMAZON VIDEO that was not free for PRIME members, but was only $3.99 to BUY.",1492646400,,1013,4.329787234042553
8388799,1,B0035APGJ2,"Doesn't get much worse than this. If you think it might be good for some T&A or softcore anything, you will be even more disappointed.",1463961600,,134,4.4

8388802,1,B0035APGJ2,"Ok, so I got suckered into watching this stupid movie on Netflix.... In a nutshell, Natasha K is the epitome of women who are IN the business yet considere themselves ABOVE the business. Most. Annoying. Women. EVER! At least in the 80s, you didn't have all this double standard PC nonsense. One of the headliners describing this movie claims that she has to ""protect herself from perverts while making a name for herself."" So the people who pay for this type of thing are ""perverts""? So then with the same mentality,wouldn't that make people who recieve money for this type of thing ""whores""?

 Yes, there is some nudity in this film but not enough to warrant the lame dialouge/concept. On a side note, there is one scene where she makes an appointment with her soon to be web manager. She walks in and he is pleasuring himself while looking at the previous nude scene on the internet. She sits for awhile casually watching him, then he finally notices her and he becomes super embarassed and shuts the computer down while covering himself up. She smiles and says ""hi!"" while he responds, ""What? They don't knock in Russia?"" She shrugs and then they get down to professional business. Okay, two MAJOR reasons of how unrealistic/stupid that scene is:

1:Like she hasn't seen that type of thing before. Being embarassed for that in front of a porn star, is like being embarassed for being hungry in front of a waiter.

2:It's not like she shrieked and ran out of the room as soon as she entered. She sat and watched him and then proceeded to casually greet him as he was going at it. Basically she shrugged her shoulders and said ""No big deal. You're jerking off."" So...... WHY would you stop??? She's from Europe (not as conservative) and she's in the industry (in that line of work, blowing your load is about as common place as blowing your nose) Back room deals/negotations get made like that all the time.

 The scene then ends with her saying ""He is, how you say, obsessed? with bopping the bologna. Is so gay!"" Uh yeah, so only stupid and or homosexual people masturbate. I'm sure Natasha doesn't ""flick the bean"" once in a while.... she's just TOO beautiful to have to resort to such a thing. Whatever.

 That's basically the attitude of this whole movie. Natasha Kizmet is this ""prima donna"" figure because of the accent, bleached hair and boob job. The reality is that those kinds of women are a dime a dozen, many of which have alot less prissy attitude. All women who enter into the entertainment business should first make a decision; are they going to star in ""mainstream"" or ""porn""?  Do not attempt to cross over from one to the other as it will always fail.",1438646400,,2671,4.606315789473684
