6710299,5,B00O4CWP7G,"""Nanu Nanu"" in 1978 Robin Williams crash landed on TV on an episode of Happy Days where he played an alien named Mork. The episode was so popular he was given his own series a while later called Mork & Mindy. This box set contains every episode of the show which all have been digitally remastered. There are also outtakes and the Happy Days episode as bonus features. I would recommend this to fans of Robin Williams, sci-fi and comedy shows. I wish it would have come with a booklet with all the episodes listed and pictures. other than that, I love it!

Robin, you will never be forgotten!",1419033600,22,592,4.431192660550459
6710300,5,B00O4CWP7G,This is a funny show. I have no idea why they took this or ALF off the air as both are good shows. I leaped at getting ALF when they released those seasons because I always liked that show and they took it off the air right after they ended it. I saw this in syndication becausae I was younger when  it  was new but its still a good show. You should get it.,1416787200,7,357,3.810810810810811
6710301,4,B00O4CWP7G,"To 'commemorate' the death of actor Robin Williams, Hollywood has finally decided release a complete DVD package of the ABC series which made him a household name.

In counterculture 1970's Boulder Colorado, Williams plays Mork, a space alien sent by his superiors to observe earth customs and report back to his superiors on the planet Ork. Because this was a 'spin'off from Happy Days' it perhaps would have royally bombed with another actor. Jumping from the 1950's to the 1970's is quite a stretch!

But Williams's comedic timing, delivery, and adlibbing (check out how hard others try to stifle laughs) itself made the series last for at least four seasons--including the less than perfect season four, when Mearth (played by Jonathan Winters) was born from Mork's navel. He WAS Mork.

During the first season pilot when his egg lands, he meets Mindy McConnell after she is stranded by a very bad date. (Pilot). Innocently believing that he is a priest, Mindy brings Mork to her apartment--and gets the shock of her life after discovering otherwise. Mork learns about earthling customs (such as the eggs in the refrigerator are not being kept in 'suspended animation!').

Most of the townspeople merely tolerate him--like Mindy's father Fred McConnell (Conrad Janis) and Mr. Bickley (Tom Poston). But Exidor, the town eccentric is his frequent partner. He even helps deliver Mearth when Mork is pregnant! It's never explained how Exidor obtained medical training.

All of the episodes are included for us diehard Mork and Mindy fans. Check out how adorable Robin Willams looks in spangles during a real-life Denver Broncos game in ""Hold that Mork"" when trying out to be their first-ever male cheerleader. Yes, this is really a live NFL game they're filming on!! I grew up in Denver so this is our 'extra' episode too. It might loose something for fans of other NFL teams---unless you can put aside your team allegiance just for the sake of watching this specific episode. It takes a very special guy indeed to run out on the field in a silver halter top and mini skirt!!

And the Happy Days episode where Mork first appeared as well as the subsequent Happy Days episode where he reappeared IS included in this 'complete series release'. Justifying the original 'release' cost in this particular case, the gags from 'Mork and Mindy' ARE included (you know they were good!). The rarely remembered spin-off cartoon series where Mork and Mindy are teenagers is not included however.

Perhaps the 'Orson report which had been previously and already included with 'Mork Meets Robin Williams""  should count as an extra. The monolog about the price of fame (originally delivered a week after John Lennon's assassination) is still really spooky. Williams just sadly fades out to black instead of doing his usual upbeat 'Nanu-Nanu' before the episode credits roll. You can actually hear the tears in his voice as Robin Williams the person versus Mork the character. We forget that they are people and not just these characters.

 I'm assuming that Williams's recent suicide ultimately had something to do with this product finally making it to market. Other more recent series were so much faster. It took forever to get this series released.

I'm not crazy about the price either, but realize this will ultimately drop. We live in a capitalist society. People want stuff to sell, so they will go back and price it to sell.",1412812800,53,3418,4.968476357267951
6710302,1,B00O4CWP7G,"At the outest, I ask that the folks who are hoovering their cursor over the comment icon and salivating regarding the prospect of lambasting this negative review on the grounds that is being posted before the product is released understand that I (and all other like me) already know that you feel that way.

The primary complaint regarding this set is equally common regarding complete series sets that are released several years after a studio releases an incomplete collection of seasons from a show. In this case, Paramount released individual sets of S1 through S3 at least three years ago and seemingly abandoned plans to release S4. This makes this case worse than a scenario in which at least three or four seasons remain unreleased before a complete series set.

It also seems that Paramount does not intend to release an individual fourth-season set any time soon.

It is predicted that a large population of my fellow ""Mork and Mindy"" fans have joined me in paying an average of $15/set for the earlier seasons and are facing the choice of paying more than $100 for this complete series set to get one more season or wait an indefinite period for an individual S4 set. BTW, despite the great contributions by Jonathon Winters, ""Mork"" repeatedly jumps the shark in S4. A double leap consists of our leads marrying and then honeymooning on Ork. They then have a baby and have Shatner guest star.

It additionally seems that folks who do not have any ""Mork"" sets can save a couple of bucks buying the individual sets and holding out with the rest of us for an S4 release.

Additionally, the product description not stating that the complete series set includes any extras indicates that it does not. This is particularly shameful considering the recent tragic death of Robin Williams.

At the very least , the set should include the ""Happy Days"" episode that introduces Mork and an episode or two of the '80s animated ""Mork"" series. Further, outtakes from the series or footage of Williams' screen test would be nice.

I, for one, refuse to shell out more than $100 effectively for one season of a series that had run its course before these episodes aired. On a related note, I will NEVER buy the post-Ron Howard ""Happy Days"" series, Aside from horrible episodes, Fonzie hanging out with the ""new class"" by that point in the series is just plain creepy. He even dates high school student Jenny Piccolo (and has her acting as his wife) in one episode.",1412812800,37,2459,4.744730679156909

I used to set my (back then) VHS tape recorder ( Today most young adults would say, VHS WHaaAT?? and never say I used to listen to that song on my 8 Track Player, that would really confuse them.  Better yet tell them and just leave them confused! ) anyway I'd try and record many episodes of this show.  This was a great all around funny sitcom to watch especially if you had Robin Williams' quick sense of humor.  I will miss this guy!  If you ever caught him and Jonathan Winters together on Johnny Carson back in the day them two would have me so tickled I'd be in tears.  Actually I will them miss both.

6710463,5,B00O4CWP7G,"Surprisingly, the character of Mork from Ork (Robin Williams) first appeared on an episode of ""Happy Days.""  Not surprisingly, Robin Williams was so talented, and made such an impact on viewers, a show was created for him to star in, entitled ""Mork & Mindy.""  Assigned by Orson to observe human behavior, Mork travels from Ork to Earth in an egg-shaped spacecraft.  Mork lands in Boulder, Colorado, and first encounters Mindy (Pam Dawber).  Of course, she takes Mork home to live with her.  That surprises Mindy's father Fred (Conrad Janis), and her grandmother Cora Hudson (Elizabeth Kerr), who both work in a music store.  One of the first humans Mork encounters is Exidor (Robert Donner), a self-professed prophet who acts crazier than Mork!  Mork and Mindy's cantankerous downstairs neighbor is Mr. Bickley, played by the late, great Tom Poston.  Each episode usually ends with Mork reporting to Orson.  In an attempt to attract younger viewers, the music store setting was dropped after season one.  Season two introduced the characters of Remo DaVinci (Jay Thomas), and his sister Jeanie (Gina Hecht), who run a New York style deli in Boulder.  The character of Nelson Flavor (Jim Staahl), Mindy's cousin who runs for city council, was also added to the cast.  A highlight from season two is the two-part episode, ""Mork vs. The Necrotons,"" which featured Raquel Welch.

In the third season, Remo and Jeanie close the deli and open an Italian restaurant.  Mindy's father Fred makes more appearances, as well as Exidor.  Nelson Flavor met and dated a new character named Glenda Faye Comstock (Crissy Wilzak), a young, beautiful widow.  A highlight from season three is the episode ""Mork Meets Robin Williams,"" which deals with our celebrity-obsessed culture, famous peoples loss of privacy, and the toll fame takes on them.  Unfortunately, the show's ratings continued to decline.  In the fourth and final season, most of the secondary characters were dropped.  Mork and Mindy get married, and honeymoon on Ork.  Mork gets pregnant, and lays an egg, which grows to gigantic proportions.  Out of the egg, their son Mearth (Jonathan Winters) is hatched.  That makes perfect sense, since Orkans age backwards.  A highlight from season four is the three-part episode, ""Gotta Run,"" in which Mork reveals to the world that he is an extraterrestrial alien.  Unfortunately, the series ended too soon, before the writers could follow up on that storyline.  Unfortunately, Robin Williams' life ended too soon.  Fortunately, his early genius is on full display in the complete series box set of ""Mork & Mindy,"" an absolute must have for all fans of Robin Williams.",1459468800,3,2657,5.092592592592593

Bonus points for including the ""Happy Dyas"" episodes featuring Mork. My only complaints are that some episodes are edited to remove music they didn't want to bother paying extra for, the first ""Happy Days"" ep lacks the epilogue that was added for at least the network re-rrun preceding the debut of this series, and it would also have been nice to include the first episode of ""Out of the Blue,"" where Mork had an extended cameo.",1445990400,8,570,4.386792452830188

Since I am hearing impaired, this set is worthless to me. I am pretty much furious, since this is not the first time that Amazon has sold me an ""un-subtitled"" set of DVDs that had been advertised as subtitled.
This is not only frustrating, but a waste of my time and energy. Are you going to figure out that disabled Customers are Customers?
I am NOT happy.

Season 3's Mork Meets Robin Williams is a foretelling story line about the cost of fame. Morks report to Orson was touching and his name could have been added to the list Mork recites. If you are a Robin Williams fan it will make you both miss him and fall in love all over again.,1423094400,2,419,4.0602409638554215
