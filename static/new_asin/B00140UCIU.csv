8466197,4,B00140UCIU,"As the title indicates, this documentary is about cloning and stem cells, and focuses mostly on stem cells. The most interesting fact mentioned concerning cloning, was that it took 277 attempts to successfully clone Dolly the sheep, who died at a relatively young age due to old age. (I highly recommend that you purchase this DVD to find out why.)
  This documentary includes desperately needed education regarding stem cells. The two types of stem cells are Embryonic Stems Cells (ESC), and Adult Stem Cells (ASC). For the most part, when the media report on ESC, they just call them Stem Cells. They usually claim that people who oppose ESC research oppose Stem Cell research because of religious or political reasons only. This is misleading for two reasons. One, people who oppose stem cell research oppose ESC, but not ASC. Two, reasons for opposing ESC go beyond religious, moral, or political concerns, since ESC research has failed to produce one single treatment for disease, ever. In other words, science is on the side of opposing ESC! This documentary is especially more important and timely, considering the Obama administration's recent overturning of George W. Bush's eight year ban on using taxpayer dollars to support failed scientific research. Consider these facts:

1) As of the release of this documentary in 2007, the score for ASC vs. ESC was 73-0! (ASC have treated 73 different diseases; ESC have treated 0 diseases!)
2) ASC have been used for more than 30 years to treat more than 20,000 Americans for 73 different diseases.
3) ASC are non-embryonic, meaning no abortion is needed, avoiding the ethical problems regarding ESC.
4) ASC treatments can use the patient's own cells, which means no tissue rejection.
5) ASC can be found all over the body, as well as in umbilical cord blood and even amniotic fluid.
6) ASC can differentiate into almost any tissue. (It was once thought that ASC could not differentiate, but this argument is no longer true.)

Also, if ESC research ever results in successful disease treatment in the future, consider these troubling facts:
1) The patient would need lifelong drug treatment to prevent tissue rejection.
2) Rapid growth could produce tumors.
3) Cells could be genetically defective.
4) Other serious side effects could occur.

  I highly recommend this DVD for more information regarding the issue of ASC and ESC research. At this time, the interest in ESC research is over POTENTIAL treatment for diseases, while ASC research has yielded PROVEN treatments. This is why the private sector favors ASC research over ESC research. This is why the government is needed to fund ESC research. With all of the moral, ethical, and scientific problems regarding ESC research, it makes no sense whatsoever to take taxpayer dollars to fund it.",1237507200,3,2801,5.04978354978355
