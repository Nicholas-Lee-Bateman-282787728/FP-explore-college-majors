502108,1,630273486X,"Greetings, all. I was gonna warn you to not get this set 'cause Paramount will soon be releasing all of these in Special Edition format. Slowly. One by one. Probably on a monthly-to-bi-monthly basis, so they can all revel in the glee of the DVD-collectin' Trekkie's frustration whilst rakin' in the bucks from the sorry people who bought the regular-edition flicks. Like I did, unfortunately.
However, it looks like a couple folks have beaten me to it in the kvetching department. So, just ignore my review, and take a look at what most of my other fellow Amazonians are saying about this sad collection. As you can see, we're pretty much on the same page regarding this situation. Thank you for your attention.
'Late!",1006387200,33,718,4.798387096774194
502109,1,630273486X,"What a letdown. I agree with the other fans here, don't waste your money. Paramount continues to show us that they're trying to take the bucks from us. It started with those two episode only DVDs of the first series--what a waste of DVD space! Don't settle for second best. Wait for Paramount to get their act together.",1005091200,17,319,4.517241379310345
502110,5,630273486X,"Star Trek fans, like me, have been around for a very long time indeed, now. (at least as long as the show itself) The Star Trek films, high grade continuations of the original show, are wonderful and dynamic. Each film has a different, yet poignant theme, interesting stories, and, like any good Star Trek film, stuff blows up. Though some of the effects weren't quite up to par, the movies still stand today as an icon to American life and ideals just as they used to. However, the major special effects problems in ""The Motion Picture"" have finally been rectified, replaced with beautiful cinematics and breathtaking special effects, moving the ENTIRE collection from a 4.5 star set of films to a straight 5. These diverse, humourous, and adventurous films truly go where no one has gone before- into a realistic and (mostly) plausible future without making things in this future TOO boring. True, the DVD's may not have tons of extra's, but I wouldn't hold my breath; there are 6 films to fill in and, in addition, these classic ""Star Trek"" films don't really need any extra's (I don't know why everyone wants them so badly- what did people do before VHS existed? Read the book while watching the film? I don't know). So, if you're a casual fan, a sci-fi fan, or a die-hard Trekkie, consider picking these up and adding them to you're collection. (Hey, there are at least as many films as there are versions of the fabled starship Enterprise!",999043200,7,1445,4.715415019762846
502111,1,630273486X,"I completely agree with Mr. Harris. The wonder of DVDs are the special features of our favorite, classic films (take a look at Lawrence of Arabia, Superman: The Movie, and the upcoming DVD release of the Godfather Trilogy...spectacular extras which makes it worth spending the money on the DVD, even if you already have the VHS version). I was extremely disappointed when I heard that the Star Trek films had no special features. The Star Trek franchise has earned Paramount a fortune! The least they could have done to repay the loyal fans was to release the DVD versions with special features. I feel that it is a money-making scam. People were sure to buy the films once they were released onto DVD, special features or not. THEN they release a Director's Edition of The Motion Picture, so that the fans will have to buy the movie AGAIN to get the extras. And NOW there's this boxed set! Folks, don't waste your money! Only ONE of the films in the boxed set has the extras...The Motion Picture. The rest of the films in the set have no special features. And, yes, Paramount has been dropping hints that they will be releasing special editions of all of the Star Trek films...one by one, of course. So why waste your money on the boxed set? I plan on buying the Director's Edition of The Motion Picture when it is released. Then I will buy the special editions of the other films as they are released. I knew that there would be special editions of the films sooner or later...common sense could tell you that...which was why I decided to wait and see. Glad I did! Don't give Paramount more money than you have to! You've given them enough! I can't give this boxed set a decent rating. I'd give it 5 stars if there were a boxed set which featured a Director's Edition of ALL of the films. Watch, they'll release special editions of all of the films individually, THEN they'll have a boxed set of it! It's unfortunate that businesses are so greedy and want to make a quick buck. They need to think more about the CONSUMER...it's because of US that they make that money in the first place. They should at least be a bit more appreciative of that fact. Can't wait to buy the Director's Edition of The Motion Picture. This will truly be a grand experience for fans of the original Star Trek series.",998956800,76,2296,4.508393285371703
502112,2,630273486X,"I am a huge Star Trek fan. So far I have bought four of the DVDs: The Next Generation triology and ST:IV. I was very disappointed in the lack of extras. Star Trek: Generations did not even contain a movie trailer. (ST:IV contained some decent extras.) Most serious Trek fans would love commentary from the directors and/or actors. It is well known that there has been footage that was not included in the theatrical releases of almost every Trek film. Most notably, ST:II, where missing footage was shown when it was originally broadcast on TV. This footage made a GREAT movie even BETTER. None of this was included in the DVD. It is rumored that Paramount will be releasing Special Editions of the Trek films, including a 2-disc set for ST:II. Don't pay Paramount twice. The Trek films are all on TV so often, that you can tape a rough copy while you wait for Paramount to give us the extras we want and deserve. (The reason I gave the set 2 stars is because they are decent movies.)",998784000,38,984,4.5027932960893855

You can start to watch the first movie and then go though all the connections points of the rest of the movies as just one connection point to another. It takes you though the entire story line of the Capt Kirk and his crew from the begnining to the end in the last movie.

502363,3,630273486X,"This version has the first 3 movies as either Director's Cuts or Special Collector's Editions but the remaining 3 are just the normal ones.  This is because Paramount has been ""updating"" this box set as and when the enhanced editions become available.  As I wasn't aware of this at the time, I ended up buying this instead of waiting for the complete set of enhanced editions to be completed.  Now that I'm aware of such under-handed tactics that Paramount are capable of, I've decided to wait until the entire series becomes available in Blu-ray which is inevitable.  In the meantime, for those of you who still want to get this version of the box set, you have been advised.

The first movie has been given the director's cut treatment which has greatly improved the movie from the original.  The sound quality is improved with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound although I would have preferred a DTS version as well, the video quality has been cleaned up well too and the extra disc has good documentaries, deleted scenes and trailers.  Overall, though the movie is still too long and drags along at a slow pace and is still not among the best of the 6 movies here and in my opinion is tied for last place with the 5th movie.  Remarkable given the director is Robert Wise who is one of the best ever directors who did classics like ""The Sound of Music"".  I guess even a great director can't do much with a sorry script.

The second movie is tied for first with the 6th movie and is also a director's cut version.  Just like the first movie, the visuals and the audio has been vastly improved although a DTS option would have been nice.  The special features are even better than the first one making great use of the 2nd disc.  Ricardo Montalban as Khan really makes this movie great as his acting is superb and believable making him by far the best villain among all the movies here.

The third movie is still very good and is the third best among the 6. Also coming in a special collector's edition with the extra disc, the visuals and sound quality have improved over the original release and the special features with excellent documentaries make the second disc a real treat.  Again, no DTS but Christopher Lloyd's performance as the villain comes in second best only to the great Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of Khan.

The fourth movie here is not the collector's edition and it happens to be a favourite among many fans.  For me, I didn't enjoy it as much as the other movies but I have to admit that it is the most humourous of all the movies and so much so that it almost becomes a comedy for me.  Still, it is not the worst movie and I would say it is the fourth best among the six.  The special features has a nice documentary about Leonard Nimoy's directing skills but little else of note.  For more, you'll have to get the collector's edition with the 2nd disc.

The fifth movie is also the original version with no special features of note worth mentioning.  Just like in the fourth movie you get the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option which helps with the sound quality but that's all you get from an otherwise average movie that is only better than the first movie of the six here.  Still, all is not lost as I really enjoyed the first and last campfire scenes which were very touching.  Perhaps if this movie were longer and I find it ironic that the movie that should have been shorter i.e. the first one isn't and the one that should have been longer i.e. this one isn't either.

The sixth movie is my favourite and is the best; the plot is great the action moves along at a good pace and best represents the best of Trek in my opinion.  No special features worth noting here but this is the one movie that I will get the director's/collector's edition in Blu-ray when it comes out or HD-DVD assuming I can find a player that will play both formats as well as my existing DVDs.  Not only is this the best Trek movie ever it is also one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Hopefully the Blu-ray version will have DTS or better sound quality as well.  Unlike the pissed poor way they ended the ST:TNG movies with ""Nemesis"", ""The Undiscovered Country"" was a very fitting way to end the Classic Trek portion of the movies.

Overall, this box set of half collector's/director's editions and half not may well be obsolete right now and if you have the patience, perhaps you'd like to wait for the HD versions to come out and then get the whole set.  As I've already got this version, I just wait to pick up the Blu-ray versions of the sixth movie and perhaps the second and third as well.

Perhaps you should too.",1202601600,,4629,4.441420118343196

With the exceptional supporting cast of DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, and Nichelle Nichols, The Original Star Trek Movie Collection, stands on it's own two feet.  All movies are unique, with a flair for adventure, a touch of humor, and a deep human touch.

502410,5,630273486X,"I'm a big fan of all of the movies so naturally I bought the complete movie set. However the original crew movies really did stand out from the last four. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise gave us a fitting conclusion to their adventures in these movies spanning twelve years. Without the original motion picture, Trek would've stayed dead and the sci-fi world as we know it would be very different. These movies were pioneers in a world dominated by action movies and they took us to a world we could never forget.

Individual Reviews

The Motion Picture - Just seeing every again after ten years made this movie pretty memorable. The director's cut is pretty cool and the bonus features are pretty good. All of the bonus discs of the movies are pretty good.

The Wrath of Khan - A fan favorite and my favorite as well. This movie really showed us how good Trek really was and the ending is the second most sentimental moment of all the movies. I doubt I'll ever be able to forget Kirk screaming Khannnn at the end.

The Search For Spock - Almost as good as The Wrath of Khan. It's bonus features are awesome and this proves that this set was a good value.

The Voyage Home - A great mix of comedy, sci-fi, and action. You'll laugh at a lot of moments and it's one of my favorite trek movies.

The Final Frontier - Everyone seems to hate this one but I don't mind it. The arguments between McCoy and Spock really brought me back to the old days of Trek. It's a sentimental movie for Spock as well.

The Undiscovered County - The final original crew movie. It incorporated Michael Dorn from the Next Generation into the movie playing Worf's grandfather. One of the best send-offs of any series and the ending was one of the most sentimental moments of any movie that I have ever watched.

Overall this set is great for people who didn't think that the Next Generation movies were that good. However if you do like TNG's movies then the complete set is an ever better value for your money. I thank Paramount for giving the fans an affordable set that had all the special editions and I highly recommend this set.",1133568000,7,2140,4.427480916030534
502411,5,630273486X,"Ten years after the final episode, including a resurgence that was bigger than it's low Neilson dictated,the first motion picture based on the original Star Trek series arrived in theaters. It would also spawn a successful film series that would go on through five more movies featuring the original series crew with a varying degree of success.
For 1979's Star Trek The Motion Picture,the filmmakers wanted to compete with Star Wars in terms of special effects & budget. And like all effects laden films, the script gets diluted. The whole V'ger revalation may've looked good on paper,but we have to go through a long drawn out build up that makes you feel it should've been a 90 minute movie,let alone a TV episode. Star Trek has always been about the story and characters. The chemestry between the crew, a little rusty since its been a decade since they've acted together,is always a saving grace.
Star Trek from the get-go has always worked on a low budget from the Classic series on down. TMP should've been an example to the Berman-era TNG movies,big budget never equals better movies.
Coming after the successful yet overbloated TMP,ST II(1982) The Wrath Of Khan was a leaner and no less meaner film that really kick started the Trek we know and love today. No other villian(aside from DS9's Gul Dukat)commands your attention like Khan(first seen in the original series episode Space Seed).Where he was set on conquering in Space Seed,he's hellbent on revenge which makes him an even effective villian. Kirsty Alley's Saavik injects a dose of new blood into the veteren crew, and the battle scenes(a far cry from the cheap opticals and camera shaking of the original series)are very effective and even the newer offspring(TNG DS9,VOY,ENT)have taken their cue from this film for space battles. Regarded as the best Trek film,Wrath of Khan has yet to be toppled,though it has come close(The Voyage Home,The Undiscovered Country, First Contact).
Star Trek III The Search For Spock (1984) establishes the""odd numbered film curse"",which odd numbered Trek film are regarded as disappointing (finally broken with Star Trek X Nemesis).
Of the odd numbered Star Trek films,TSFS is the best. Not as great as the even numbered,but holds up better than Generations(VII) and V The Final Frontier.
Leonard Nimoy's direction is surprisingly well done,despite the hokey outcome of Spock's resurrection. The destruction of the Enterprise was both effective as well as heart-wrenching.even the supporting crew members(Scotty,Sulu,Uhura and Chekov),always ignored in the past,also have great moments.
As a bridge between II and IV,it seems like a holding pattern that is best watched as the middle of a trilogy in one sitting.
Like The Trouble With Tribbles,ST IV The Voyage Home (1986) may not be the best(II tops them all),but it's certainly many fans favorite.
What makes this film work is its humor as well as its warmth and heart. The cast look like they're having so much fun filming it, that it rubs off on the audience. Equally funny is seeing our beloved crew of the USS Enterprise,looking awkward and out of place in the 20th century.
The movie is also fast paced and tightly edited as many obsticles(the Klingon Crystal depletion,the search for the whales in the ocean as well as the hospital scenes)pile up upon one another yet successfully resolving themselves. Subsequent film that try to replicate IV's formula end up looking clumsy(V and Insurrection)because they miss the point that behind great comedy is heart.
As a continuing chapter in the Star Trek films,ST V The Final Frontier(1989) bites the dust. The plot was ridiculous as the Enterprise is hijacked by an outcasted Vulcan zealot,who turns out to be Spock's half brother in his search for God. The Nimbus III planet setting reminded me of those bad post-apocolyptic straight-to-video flicks,& poor De Kelley looked like he could've had a heart attack (though his presence is always a godsent in TREK).
But if was intended or not,it has an Ed Wood-esque appeal,being humorous without even trying. The scene where Spock & Bones expierience their past pain is effective in bringing some sense of drama in this farce.
In a world where one of the most popular Trek episodes is one of the worst (SPOCK'S BRAIN),V is mostly seen as one of the many bad chapters in a great tapestry of stories.
ST VI The Undiscovered Country (1991)is a fitting swan song to the original series crew which bridges many event that shows up on subsequent series(The Khitomer Accords,Klingon Honor,etc).The film gives our aged but beloved heroes a send-off that couldn't even be cheapened by the next film,Generations token TOS apperance.
Its mix of action,suspense,and even mystery making this a very entertaining film. The return to the directors chair of II's Nick Meyers is a godsend(attn Rick Berman,Should've hired Mr Meyers for Star Trek X).As Capt. Sulu of the Excelsior fittenly puts it,""Nice to see you in action,one more time.""
 The following movie,the first Next Generation feature Star Trek Generations(1994) saw the passing of the torch between the two crews(as well as the death of Capt. James T. Kirk ).Unfortunately after three additional movie outings, The TNG era films has yet to capture the big screen experience like the Classic Crew films.",1131753600,4,5299,5.062929061784897

The sites and people that are selling you these movies for $156 and upwards are RIPPING YOU ALL OFF. The movies are great, but really try and look elsewhere for better prices. I got my 12 disk set for $67 with shipping included from CH online. Its crazy to think that others are paying WAY more for thier sets, just a warning thats all.

502435,5,630273486X,"This is a very good buy for anyone who is a Trekky, the box and cd's are to die for in of themselves. However, don't let them fool you in thinking that the first one has been cut down. The enterprise shot in the beginning is just as long as in the older VHS versions. I say this because I had heard with the director's cut it had been spliced down some.

The music does make up for this very long scene however, if you're willing to stick around and watch it. Other than that, unlike the star wars series you can pretty much sit back and watch these without having to watch for new scenes that for some reason you don't remember being there.",1118620800,,641,4.128
502436,5,630273486X,"Although many have good points in their reviews of this disc set (good and bad), this is the newest box set release. I guess this is a perfect example of the saying ""You can't please them all.""

If you look at the title it says ""Star Trek - The Original Crew Movie Collection (Special Edition)"". ""Special Edition"" being the operative words. And if you enlarge the picture you can read that the first two are directors cuts and the remaining ones are special edition.

In saying this, I believe this is the box set to buy (unless you want them all to be director cuts). I give it 5 stars because I love Star Trek. It's true that some of the movies are better than others but the same could be said for the series. But I didn't stop watching just because a few of the episodes weren't up to par with the others.

It's Star Trek and that is the only thing that matters for us trekkies.",1116028800,23,882,4.238095238095238
502437,4,630273486X,"The Original Crew Movie Collection is just what the doctor ordered for a dyed in the wool original series fan like myself.
It reminds me firstly how it all started. From seeing the original series,see it go off the air ,see its' resurrection and renewed interest in the early 70s then hear the rumours fly about a possible movie release with the crew and the rumours turn to reality with the release of ""ST:The Motion Picture"".I recall vivdly how long I waited in the long lines to see it and how the audience reacted during key moments in the film and how at the end we all applauded.
Then the wait and anticipation for the next film and the next,and the next.
Then there was the big letter writing campaign when rumours flew about the impending death of Spock. No one wanted Spock out of the series and our chrouses of letters kept Leonard Nimoy and character firmly ensconced on the Enterprise until Star Trek 6(at least I'd like to THINK it was our efforts that saved the day!).
Thing was we never knew for SURE from one movie to the next whether there would be another. The only thing to do was just to be there and support Paramounts' newest Trek release and hope the number crunchers would decide in our favour and release another one.
That's all history now and the movies WERE made and as I watch them again(and again)I realize just how GOOD they all were. The movies varied in their plots from picture to picture and they didn't always hit a bulls-eye consistently(I don't any franchises that have) but it was the original crew ,their characters were totally consistent with the original TV show(and from picture to picture) and the acting was always no less than top notch.
I won't rate my favourite motion pictture as they're all pretty close but I will just say for the record that many fans and critics alike have dumped on Star Trek 5 as pretty much the worst of the bunch citing everything from plot to William Shatners' directing skills. I for one disagree with this assessment.
While the plot may not be as ""snappy"" as some of the others I found Mr. Shatners' directing as good as any of the movies others and I think it stands up well with repeated viewings.
In conclusion this set of the original crew is a delight to own and a special delight to watch.
And I must add that this set is the BEST way to see these movies. Each are two-disc sets loaded with all the extras one could ever wish for,remastered and presented in beautiful widescreen presentations.
A must have for all original series fans and/or for any Star Trek fan.",1103500800,5,2548,4.505399568034557
502438,1,630273486X,"You don't know how hard I have tried to like these movies. But let's face it it is not the REAL thing! You can't just sit in front of your tv set and PRETEND that you are watching the real and original Star Trek. These super Hollywood productions can only be a pale imitation of the original. And something is lost while robbing off the tv series. Very similar to the Avengers disaster in 1997. The philosophy, the 'spirit' has been left somewhere in 1969. What Gene Roddenbery was aiming to do can not be seen here. Actually, in Star Trek he was aiming to show the audience the problems of their day. Sensitive social issues of 1960s (which would be a trouble to show directly because of the censorship of the day) were taken to the future, to the Star Trek Universe and then reflected to the audience. And I think, this is what that makes Star Trek so special and so timeless despite of the elementary special effects of a time before CG. Yes, the characters are the same; It is the same Kirk  or Spock and not played by another actor but how can one believe that these grandpas go where no man has gone before? May be in their youth. This reminds me of Roger Moore's James Bond in 1980s. Pretending to be a super spy in his late 50s. You can't like these movies. You just watch them because you feel pity for your favourate characters who have lost the glory of their youth.",1090454400,2,1377,4.316602316602316
502439,5,630273486X,"I was thrilled when I found this box set containing the first six ""Star Trek"" films in their two-disc collector's editions. I had to get it. Let's take a look shall we?
""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" Rating: 3.5/5
This is the long-awaited director's cut which actually subtracts about 12 minutes and adds a few necessary special effects. The film isn't as boring as it used to be and the focus is now more on the story than the special effects. The second disc is pretty good as well with three interesting documentaries and a load of deleted scenes.
""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" Rating: 5/5
This timeless sci-fi classic is now in beautiful widescreen with all the action and intensity in tact. This is even the director's cut with three more minutes of footage, though granted you don't even notice the added scenes. Overall it's a great movie and the features on the second disc are very worth the money.
""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" Rating: 4/5
This third film adventure for the original crew of the USS Enterprise is an exciting and action-packed ride that almost equals it's predecessor. A very enjoyable film with great special features.
""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" Rating: 4.5/5
This is the black sheep of the bunch in the sense that it's mostly a comedy, but it's well-done and an enjoyable adventure worth seeing.
""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" Rating: 2.5/5
This is probably the worst of the movies, period. It tries to blend the action and adventure of films two and three with the comedy of film four and fails on an epic scale, not to mention shoddy special effects at the end.
""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" Rating: 5/5
Nicholas Meyer returns to direct this final voyage and it's excellent. This wraps up the story with the Klingons and sets the stage for ""The Next Generation,"" which had been on the air for a few years by the time this film came out.
Overall, it's a fantastic box set for any Trekkie or sci-fi movie buff. Each movie has a running audio as well as text commentary as well as documentaries on the makings of each film, trailers, and interviews. It's well worth it!",1087862400,134,2128,4.602631578947369
502440,4,630273486X,"There's nothing unique about this boxed set. If you have the films in their individual format, you've already got this as well. Since Paramount plans on re-releasing all these movies in special editions, you'll end up duplicating what you've already purchased.
ST:TMP Director's Edition is actually an improvement on the original film. Gone are the unfinished special effects sequences (such as the extended space walk with the struts supporting the Enterprise set visible). Gone also are dialog and other sequences were duplicated by other scenes. Director Robert Wise has tightened the film and improved the overall structure.
The special effects sequences have been improved. Some of the scenes that Wise didn't have time to have finished because of the looming release date deadline. The sequence on Vulcan is most notable. The sequence in the shuttle bay landing area at Star Fleet San Francisco has been improved with additional digital effects as well. Unfortunately, the matte lines around the Klingon ship at the beginning are still there. It's a minor flaw.
Wrath of Kahn has a number of extended scenes and bits of dialog that actually give greater depth to the relationships of the characters throughout the film. Nicholas Meyer has improved the overall feel of the film by adding these sequences back in. Additionally, the second disc of supplmental material is quite good as well.
Search for Spock isn't a ""director's edition"" so, perhaps, Leonard Nimoy felt that he got the film right the first time. Instead, it does offer an enhanced widescreen transfer that's beautiful and a second disc of supplemntary material. There's also a running commentary by Nimoy, Harve Bennett and cast members that's quite good (although it is duplicated on the supplementary section of the second disc).
The other films are the previously available discs without any extras. ST: TMP 3 stars: WOK 4 stars: SFS 3 stars: IV 5 stars: V 2 stars: Undiscovered Country 4 1/2 stars.",1039564800,9,1972,5.127329192546584
502441,1,630273486X,"This isn't going to be one of my particularly long reviews this go-around. Instead, I'm just going to lay down my thoughts on this new offering from Paramount's vacuum machine. (Don't get me wrong, Paramount puts out some great movies, as these are.)
The six movies aren't in question here. We know them, seen them, and have our favorites. What is in question is the marketing tactic. I had bought the ""Director's Edition"" of ""The Motion Picture,"" and felt like it was a good buy. I picked up STII & III on DVD because I wanted the Home Theater experience. Now, go to your local store and look on the shelves. The ""Director's Cut"" of STII & III with the rest on the way.
I can't lie, the movies are great on DVD and it's like reliving the whole experience. Just to make a simple point. Ask yourself how many times you want to purchase the same movie over again with a little more ""Behind-the-Scenes"" and ""Deleted Scenes"" each time. Is it worth it?
My advice is to look at what Paramount is going to put out and buy at that time. Maybe in the future they'll have all the ""Director's Cuts"" together in one package and it'll be worth the money.

Overall, the movies themselves are a disappointment when compared to TOS. Despite the fancier special effects, they are long on various gimmicks and mostly lack that  special appeal that Star Trek always had. There was a lot of heart in TOS, virtually every episode had a larger meaning, and that is lacking here. There are a few good scenes and story lines in the movies, such as when the crew steals the Enterprise to go rescue their friend Spock in Star Trek III , but alot of it seems to be drivel.
