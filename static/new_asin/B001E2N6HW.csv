The meat of the lesson is learning licks (short musical phrases) note for note. Mr. Humphries shows (visually & verbally) you which string and which fret each note falls on so it's easy to follow without tablature - just like a private instructor would teach in person.

The one thing I would change would be to stress that each lick should be played in every key and every position so it becomes part of your own style. A few simple examples of how to transpose licks to other situations would be invaluable.",1349740800,,783,4.625899280575539
8326379,5,B001E2N6HW,"These are not easy, but if your willing to put in the time you can really improve your playing. Jaimie Humphries is not as polished as Andy James or Danny Gill as video instructors. For example on the the longer scale runs, his verbal walk-thru is a pain to follow. Get yourself a sheet or two of tab paper and write them down as he stumbles through it and you'll save yourself a lot of headache.",1294531200,2,396,4.223684210526316
