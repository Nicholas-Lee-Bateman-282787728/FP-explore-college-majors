2645575,3,B000HWZ4LQ,"Well, as a super cheesy Christmas movie when you have super young kids, it is fine.  But for anything beyond that, it is a waste of time.  There were to pieces to this that I found rather disturbing.  First of all - the part where the boyfriend was willing to accept her no matter what he found about her past.  That there was no way that she could be a bad person or do anything that would make him change his view of her. Oookay.  Let's say (because this has happened) that she regains her memory and it just so happens that she is a mother with a husband.  All of a sudden NO MATTER WHAT HER PAST doesn't matter takes on a new light.  Of course this was a cheesy movie as I said - but there are good reasons why not to just go jumping into something without checking your own selfish reasons at the door.  Specially at a time like Christmas he should have considered that angle, not just how much HE loved her - because then, it isn't about her or her well being - it is about him.

Second - the ""magic"" pen and cookie moment was unnecessary. Fine, she had magic - but why those scenes?",1355961600,,1089,4.099056603773585
2645576,5,B000HWZ4LQ,excellent DVD.  very pleased with the movie. I love Christmas movies and had just watched the movie on Hallmark Channel.  I was very happy to see Amazon had it available.,1355356800,,170,4.633333333333334
2645577,3,B000HWZ4LQ,"Around the holiday season, every TV channel seems to show yet another movie about somebody saving Christmas.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Christmas-Twice-Upon-a-Christmas/dp/B000HWZ4JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Christmas / Twice Upon a Christmas</a>&nbsp;has the benefit of being at least a bit original/different. In the film, Santa's two daughters, Kristin and Rudolpha, alternatively try to save and destroy Christmas. The movie doesn't focus so much on jolly St. Nick himself, but rather the naughty and very nice daughters.

However, this movie isn't going to make it into the holiday classics. The acting is decent, but not great. In fact, the movie seems to spend way too much time with Rudolpha, the evil sister/villain, whose acting was over the top, rather than developing the rest of the characters. Kristen Claus by contrast comes across as a bit too pure and kindly.

The film was made-for-TV, and definitely looks it. The production quality looks more like a late 1980s movie than something that came out only a few years ago. In fact, when I was watching it, I was sure it came out much earlier.

Other scenes were just flat out corny. The call to Donald Trump didn't really advance the story and wasn't particularly funny. The movie doesn't even use the real Donald. The ending came a bit too magically and suddenly (I don't want to spoil it, but you'll see what I mean).

2645687,3,B000HWZ4LQ,"This is a kids' Christmas movie and I often like them very much, but this one is not the kind I like so much:  too much buffoonery and slapstick humor for me.  I gave it 3 stars for that reason -- it's really not bad for the kind of movie it is and I'm sure lots of kids (kids of all ages!) will enjoy it.  It's just not my cup of tea.
  Santa has two daughters, one very good, the other as evil as evil can be:  she's trying to destroy Christmas again, this time by breaking up the North Pole into little pieces and selling it.  Her good sister has lost her memory and so has no way to prevent the demise of Christmas.
  It is not a low budget film and has some nice special effects, some pretty good scenery and the acting is fine, if you like this kind of story. I'll put it this way:  evil sister Rudolfa is very obviously evil -- if you forget that for a moment she'll be happy to remind everyone in the audience.  I can see this one being pretty popular with the right kind of audience.",1417564800,,992,3.984771573604061
