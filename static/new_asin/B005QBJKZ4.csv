8483059,4,B005QBJKZ4,"Following on the first of the series, based on the very popular Philo Vance books, written by S.S. Van Dine  (pseudonym), also released in 1929, William Powell is given star billing, instead of being co-starred as in the first film. Supporting him are Jean Arthur, who did a few minutes in the first film (The Canary Murder Case), but now has a substantial role, and Eugene Pallette, as the cooperating Police Sergeant. All three went on to very successful careers in the talkies, with the first two being stars, and the third, a leading character actor. The Canary Murder Case, while of significant historical interest, was limited by the vocal constraints imposed by the primitive sound recording technology. Speeches often sounded stilted with the frequent outcome being that each person's part in the dialogue seemed to be preceded by a moments silence (as if the actor was gathering himself together to make it). That is true of this film, although there is a movement toward greater fluidity in the dialog.
The adaptation is not by Van Dine (who had a hand in the Canary). Someone is killing off the occupants of the Greene Mansion. Under the terms of the dead industrialists will, the survivor(s) gets the whole shebang. Who is the Killer? How were the Murders accomplished? The intellectual, Philo Vance, had better come up with the answer, otherwise the murderer will never be known.
As I say, there is an artificial quality to the screenplay. Yet, the film itself is interesting: it shows how far even these accomplished actors had to go to achieve the fluidity that the talkies required, and, it introduces players who went to the top stratum of stardom, or, in the case of Pallette, to a leading position among character actors. Hopefully, any contemporary reissue will be transformed by proper digitization; available copies tend to be made from original, now ancient, film.",1331510400,5,1887,4.952681388012619
