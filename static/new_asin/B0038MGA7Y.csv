4088540,2,B0038MGA7Y,"As Susan Brown states in this video, cellulite massage is a widely spread modality in Russia and Europe. As I hail from Eastern Europe, I can confirm this is absolutely correct: manual cellulite treatment is the second most popular type of massage in the region, following Swedish and preceding deep tissue. That's why I already had a basic understanding of the modality but I looked forward to expanding my knowledge. As I'm unable to attend all continuing education workshops that I'm interested in, I often resort to training videos and I've always found it a worthy investment.

Although cellulite is an issue that plagues most adult women, its causes are actually poorly understood by dermatologists which makes its treatment a serious challenge. There are probably over a hundred books here on Amazon dedicated to the topic and each tells a different story. Besides, depending on the source cellulite may be cited as anything ranging from a minor skin defect to a disorder.

Needless to say, given the topic and the price of $70, I had very high expectations of this DVD. What I anticipated was to brief me first on the theories regarding cellulite and offer some insights into them. Educating your clients properly is essential to the success of the treatment and I was looking forward to some useful tips as well. I also wanted to see sensible advice on what should not be done during a protocol. Lastly, general marketing tricks fit this video more than any other.

What a bitter, bitter disappointment. Here's a summary of what I did not like:
1/ Susan Brown! She has a 'cold pro' attitude that I find particularly unappealing in therapists. Even if Ms Brown is good at her manual work, she definitely lacks the engaging way of speaking of successful teachers. Not even one smile graced her face during the entire length of the video. Showing a bit of enthusiasm about your work can never hurt your business!
2/ The instructional part: actual instruction takes only about a fifth of the DVD. She demonstrates the techniques on the left side and then proceeds to repeat the same strokes on the right side. This is totally unnecessary on a massage training video. Some massage modalities offer flowing transitions from one part of the body to the other that you must see and try but this is not the case of cellulite treatment.
3/ The theoretical part in the beginning is lacking and insufficient. All she said can be found on the first pages of googling the word 'cellulite'.
4/ There was very little on inappropriate technique. It is Ms Brown's job, not mine to point out that too much aggression can lead to adverse effects. Cellulite massage boils down to a combination of myofascial release and lymphatic drainage - by default both are gentle techniques and if you hurt your client, you're not doing it right. While it might cause some discomfort and topical tenderness after the first few of sessions, lividities all over the buttocks and thighs indicate trauma to the body, not healing.
5/ Pricing. Susan Brown states charging should be $1800 upfront for the entire program, or $100 per every 40-min session. It would have been more useful to tie the price to other modalities offered by the same practicioner. It does make a difference if your spa charges $60 or $160 for Swedish when you consider the price of your cellulite massage program.
6/ Product advice: all she said was 'there are many over-the-counter products, use one of them for your sessions'. And that was it!! There is a TON that could be said on the topic and even if you don't want to advertise a brand, you could still supply a few recommendations about the ingredients. Is it OK to use a warming or a cooling effect product? I'll still have to wonder.

That said, my biggest complaint is the product to price ratio. It's a total rip-off in my book. She shows very little in terms of technique - only 7 or 8 strokes. Unlike more challenging modalities such as NMT and even deep tissue, cellulite massage on this video doesn't look like it takes a highly trained professional. The DVD leaves me with the impression that anyone with cursory knowledge of massage and anatomy can do this type of work by following a few simple rules. I certainly expected much, much more for my money. $70 is what I paid for Val Guin's forearm dance - 3 hours of beautifully produced instruction that brought a big turn to my career. $70 is the price of 2 Real Bodywork videos to run a total of 3-5 hours. If the cellulite massage DVD cost $20, that would have been sensible. At $30, it would challenge the value of the investment. $50 is simply outrageously overpriced for those 15 minutes of actual instruction and a few common sense perks.

$70 is a disgrace.

It is not to say that the DVD does not merit good quality of production and editing. That's why I gave a second star. However, I'm not there for the fancy camera and spa settings, I'm there to learn something new as a spice to my career. A more cheerful teacher might have netted the DVD a third star but I feel two is a gift considering what I got for what I paid. Something in Susan Brown herself irked me. She left me with the feeling she can't wait to take my cash and shut the door behind my back as soon as I leave to count it. It's true, we're in this business because of the money but nonetheless, we must always remember that not pain but vanity drives women to massages table for cellulite treatment.

8391460,5,B0038MGA7Y,I am constantly trying to offer new services in my salon to keep expanding and improving my business. We began offering massage a few years ago and business has doubled. I recently decided to add cellulite massage on to the list of massage packages we offer in the salon. I explored many training options for my employees but this video kept coming back with rave reviews and recommendations. I was so happy I purchased it! It made the training process so quick and efficient. My staff was able to pick up the technique wonderfully as this video is laid out in a very easy-to-understand format. I will keep this video in my shop and every new employee will be required to watch it. I just love this company and will look for other videos that pertain to my business.

8391463,5,B0038MGA7Y,"I never learned about cellulite massage at my school(Arizona School of Massage Therapy), so I was really intrigued. I thought it would be a good modality to learn because I primarily work with women, and women are always trying to be at their healthiest weight.

My first week trying out cellulite massage, my clients were soooo excited to try it! They say they can really feel the cellulite melting under my hands, and a few new clients booked again. This DVD was a super great addition to my knowledge and practice, and I will be using it in the future.

This DVD gave very simple explanations, which in turn helped me explain to my clients how the massage gets rid of cellulite and what techniques I'm using. It gave lots of tips as well!

I really enjoyed learning from Susan Brown, and I'd recommend this to any therapist! :D",1418947200,2,830,4.557046979865772

8391465,4,B0038MGA7Y,I almost didn't buy this based on the only other review that was posted at the time. I am glad I went ahead and purchased it. I found it very helpful and loaded with usefull info. I am a massage therapist but was not familar with this technique. Someone experienced with cellulite massage may not benefit as much from it. I only gave it 4 stars as I found she did waste time on showing you twice how to work the same area (doing both right and left sides).,1323216000,12,456,4.134831460674158
