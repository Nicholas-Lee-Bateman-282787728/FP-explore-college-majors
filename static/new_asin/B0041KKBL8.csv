4244089,5,B0041KKBL8,"We really like the Zorro series with Duncan Regehr, we got tired of the commercial breaks and the interruption in TV transmissions - so we just ordered all the seasons.  I am so thrilled that all of seasons were available, now we can view one of our favorite old time shows in complete enjoyment.",1369958400,,296,4.481481481481482
4244090,4,B0041KKBL8,"Season 3 starts off pretty strong for the first few episodes. Then it becomes a mixed bag. For me the most painful episodes to watch are The Buccaneers and A New Beginning. These are guested by Jesse Ventura a dazzling big mouth wrestling commentator back in the day. But as an actor? All the FaBreeze, Oust, and Lysol combined couldn't get the stink out. And the kid who played his son was no better, P U! As for the rest of the season you have to go through one or two bad episodes at a time to get to a really good one. Plus the swordplay is a little scarce in this season, but what swordplay there is it looks great as always. The characters are all still solid and it is still worth watching, but I recommend you get Seasons 1 and 2 first. (which is an obvious thing to do) and sort of glide through this and look for the hidden jewels.",1314057600,,841,4.134146341463414
4244091,4,B0041KKBL8,"The Alcalde is dead, long live.... the Alcalde?

Yeah, ""Zorro: The Complete Season Three"" introduces a rather drastic cast change: with the death of Alcalde Ramon, a new Alcalde comes to Los Angeles... and he's just as bad as the old one. While changing the villain is a drastic step, the series remains otherwise unchanged -- lots of swashbuckling action, comic relief, and a  pretty solid cast with good chemistry.

The pueblo is delighted when a new alcalde arrives: an old schoolmate of Diego's named Ignacio de Soto (John Hertzler) who is wildly popular because... he's not Ramon. But it soon turns out that he's no better, when he imprisons the entire aristocracy of the pueblo in the de la Vega hacienda until he can catch Zorro. Of course, Diego/Zorro (Duncan Regehr) has something to say about this.

And this isn't the last time Zorro grapples with difficult problems: elaborate mind games, secret weapons, a feud over a wolf, a hostage situation at the jail, MORE pirates, a deadly sharpshooter, a devious widow, a hypnotist who uses Diego as a thief, a democratic election, Mendoza suffers a fit of amnesia, a Japanese castaway, an emissary whose racism is turned against him, and a siege by cruel bandits that can only end in death.

The characters also deal with some more personal problems -- Victoria (Patrice Camhi-Martinez) becomes engaged to another man and runs for office, Diego and Alejandro (Henry Darrow) have to deal with their ex-girlfriends, and Diego tries to teach Mendoza how to be a gentleman.

For the record, ""Zorro: The Complete Season Three"" doesn't suffer at all from the switch in antagonists. Alcalde de Soto is a little different from Alcalde Ramon, but he pretty much the same -- a devious, obsessive guy who comes up with Evil Plans on a near-weekly basis. I mean, the guy became alcalde by fighting a DUEL for it!

And the rest of the season is pretty much in the vein of the past two -- Zorro sweeps around with his sword and disguise, kicking butt in mildly comedic ways, while romancing Victoria. Fortunately the writers keep the stories from seeming repetitive, adding in some new twists like an episode where Zorro and the Alcalde end up alone in the wilderness, both suffering from blindness. And there are some darker stories, such as the gritty, brutal ""siege"" of Los Angeles.

The one real downside? The Christmas story is absolutely sickmaking: a cloying plot where Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus (huh?) come to the pueblo because of a letter Mendoza wrote. One word: Ugh.

John Hertzler fits in well with the cast, although he looks more like a contemporary of Diego's dad rather than Diego himself. But whatever: he's a delightfully hard-nosed villain, with a brash quality unlike his predecessor. Regehr remains a likable, slightly wisecracky hero who avoids seriously harming his opponents, and there are moments for James Victor, Camhi-Martinez, Juan Diego Botto and Darrow to shine.

""Zorro: The Complete Third Season"" adds a replacement villain to the cast, but otherwise it's just another solid round of vigilante justice.",1289433600,4,3078,4.9361702127659575
4244092,5,B0041KKBL8,"I'm 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions). Do NOT try to ""compare"" it to the Disney series. They're totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more ""meat"" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults.",1289433600,,582,4.715686274509804

8412930,5,B0041KKBL8,"THIS SERIES IS EXCELLENT, BRINGS BACK THE FUN DAYS. BETTER THAN DISNEY'S ZORRO, ALL HE DID WAS SMILE. IF YOU CHECK DUNCAN REGEHR'S WEBSITE AND WILL NOTICE HE LOOKS VERY MUCH THE SAME TODAY AS HE DID WHEN HE FILMED ALL 4 SEASONS. JUST WISH THE EPISODES WERE LONGER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES.
