3899478,5,B002BX0LU8,"Let me start by thanking Bob for putting together a simple but in depth education from start to finish.  I have reviewed some so called training courses and it was basically a bad video and a few words.  Bob teaches you basic electronics which is all you will need to know, with diagrams and video instruction that will show you exactly how to do it.  All you have to do is buy the equipment and truly follow the dvd's and you will build your system.  These video's are by far the best you will ever get for this small price.  Bob, again thank you for caring enough to put together these college quality dvd's.  My advice is if you want quality education without having to go to college.  You better buy these dvd's.  He even gives you a tool list you will need to get the job done.",1262736000,14,782,4.236486486486487
3899479,5,B002BX0LU8,"This course is a great introduction to solar power and is well worth it. It is presented in a very clear way for us non-techies. Make sure you know the contents of the material before you have some sales guy smooth talk you through buying a system that does not meet your needs. This course beets the Fuvusa, Macelwain, and Abella books that I have read in the past.",1254700800,14,366,4.318840579710145
3899480,5,B002BX0LU8,"Have you gone out and purchased solar panels and then asked yourself - ""What now?"".  Then you need to have a look at this 3 DVD instructional video set to answer that question.  Bob Nagy has set up what could pass as a technical school course on the installation of battery stored solar panels.  The language is as basic as it can be given the subject, and he hand-holds you through the elementary electronics.  Don't be scared!

Even if you end up hiring a professional after all - or - decide to go with a grid-tie system, this course will teach you what you need to know to make a truly informed decision about how you'll use your panels, the pros and cons of battery back-up over grid-tie, and how to get the most efficiency out of your panels.

If you haven't purchased panels yet, the course will help you figure out what you'll need to buy, and could easily save you the price of the DVD by helping you make the right purchase for what you're trying to power.

It would be nice if you could just watch the course linearly, instead of going back to the menu each time, but that's a minor consideration.  If you're really trying to take in this information, you'll need to plough through it a chapter at a time anyway and take notes.

Considering what you'll learn from it, this video course is a true bargain.",1247011200,11,1315,4.378600823045267
3899501,5,B002BX0LU8,I bought this video because I am totally new to the solar concept. The video is geared toward someone who has never installed any solar components before like myself.,1380844800,,166,4.758620689655173
3899502,5,B002BX0LU8,"It took me a couple of days to get through this fairly dense training course. But now that I've watched it a couple of times I can honestly say that this dvd has increased my knowledge in the world of DIY PV installation more than any other resource I have found yet.

Bob really breaks it down, and covers wide range of hardware as well as application and installation advice. He even shows you how to solder correctly (I had been doing it wrong my whole life) and makes no assumptions about skill levels. He has already emailed me a few times to answer some of my questions, so his email support is like an added bonus. The DVD is nicely edited and organized by chapter, not thrown together like other training vids I have seen.

From the perspective of a beginner if you want in-depth info with excellent attention to detail then I highly recommend this DVD . I had almost considered enrolling in a PV installation class for $1500 before I found this training dvd. Glad I didn't. This DVD is well worth the $$.

Thanks Bob!",1359158400,5,1026,4.417989417989418
3899503,5,B002BX0LU8,Better than I expected very detailed great illustration and explinations I would recommend to my friends and family. I had my reservations but I was pleasently surprised,1355529600,,169,5.296296296296297
3899504,5,B002BX0LU8,"I am not an engineer or electrician.  However, I feel confidant after watching this that I can get my project done in the remote areas of South Texas. If you want to do a low power project like power your camp to run computers, small frig, water, etc then this is great. For larger projects you might weight your strengths on if you should get some help.  Lets face it, this stuff can kill you.",1351468800,,394,4.24
3899505,5,B002BX0LU8,"I have bought 4 other courses and they don't even come close to this course. And Bob has continued to give me support via email. This is the real deal!

Thanks Bob.",1340064000,,164,4.125
3899506,5,B002BX0LU8,Thanks Bob for a great little DVD set that is such a nice educational guide for the DIY person and a good insight into the Solar Power arena.,1322438400,,141,4.071428571428571
3899507,2,B002BX0LU8,I have been installing PV and solar thermal systems for over 10 years and I found Bob's video severely lacking in several critical areas.  One is electrical safety regarding the National Electric Code. If you think you can safely build a battery box that has absolutely no acid containment you are wrong.  The do-it-yourself mounting systems didn't look very professional or long lasting.  I wouldn't use rope as a guy wire.,1319673600,8,424,4.943661971830986
3899508,5,B002BX0LU8,"This set of videos I first saw in my Photovoltaics class, and they where very informative. I was very taken with the fact that this training videos are just like the the videos at collage level classes. If you are interested in a good solar panel installation and related information this is the course for you. On a scale from 1 to 5 this is a five. enjoy.",1307577600,4,357,4.264705882352941
3899509,5,B002BX0LU8,"I own a Solar installation company in India. 90% are off-grid with battery backup. I have taken a 2 day solar training + hundreds of dollars on books and CDs. Still I was missing something till I bought this DVD set. Bob explains each component in detail; pretty much everything you need to know. He was even kind enough to answer a few of my questions through personal email. Now I am pretty confident about my business and even I started training my people on Solar PV installation.

Thank you Bob.",1298592000,12,500,4.4945054945054945
3899510,5,B002BX0LU8,This product that I purchased is much better than I ever expected.  The presenter is very easy to follow and the bonus information helped me right away.  I enjoyed this video once and I will go through it again. I work in the energy efficiency field and it helps me to speak easier to the products that I sell to my customers. I look forward to other subjects from Bob Nagy and Green Power Videos.,1282348800,5,397,4.28
8362370,5,B002BX0LU8,great video Bob is a great teacher and dedicated will teach you the proper way to do solar well worth the money!,1475020800,,112,4.136363636363637
8362371,5,B002BX0LU8,Good simple information,1466985600,,23,7.0
8362372,5,B002BX0LU8,This is better than the DIY Solar books I have purchased. It was clear and explained how to size a system and put it together economically. It told you how to mount the Solar panels cheaply and safely. It explained the difference between charge controllers and the different types of batteries. I would buy this again. This would be the only resource I would recommend to friends who wanted to go off grid or sell power back to the grid. It simply has everything I needed to know. It is a no-brainer for DIY Solar enthusiasts.,1449878400,,526,4.489583333333333

8362376,5,B002BX0LU8,"This video is very informative, as others have said like a college course. It teaches you everything you need to get a home solar system up and running as well as some safety. It teaches you to how to plan for you system and if you have a limited or unlimited budget. The new version 3.0 also gets into some information on setting up on-grid, and hybrid systems.

The main idea for this DVD set is for off-grid systems. So if your looking for a DIY off-grid system and want to know key information on how to do it yourself, what safety, and tools you may need. This movie set will help you get started, For the price its a little pricey, but if you plan to teach others in your family or friend group worth sharing with them as well.

I do recommend this DVD set, but think it would be better priced at the 20-25$ range for a single person or family DIY teaching program.
This DVD set helped me come up with a better design for a small outdoor sitting area(like a pavilion/patio) I plan to have a battery bank at for led lighting and other 12v system's like a fan, maybe DVD player that's actually a car player. LOL Should be fun, just have to make sure I have the number of AMP Hours I need to run it and not have to worry about cloudy days.",1408233600,,1242,4.149377593360996
8362377,3,B002BX0LU8,Just ok.  I guess I was looking for some more help than the basics. Not worth the money.,1406160000,,88,3.888888888888889
8362378,5,B002BX0LU8,"If you no mechanical skills and no grasp of electricity this may be a little hard to understand, but you can learn it.  If you have some idea of how things work, this is a super series.  Very easy to understand.",1383091200,,211,4.121951219512195
