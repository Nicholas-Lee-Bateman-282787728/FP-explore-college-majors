2343968,5,B0009ZE9BW,I would suggest this set to any Python fan. Thoroughly enjoyable. And 6 DVDS!!!!,1177113600,2,80,4.785714285714286
2343969,5,B0009ZE9BW,Well since I love Monty Python it's always awesome.  The CDs were in great shape.,1176336000,,81,4.4
2343970,4,B0009ZE9BW,"I really enjoyed seeing the old sketches, although some of the commentary was a bit forced and boring.  John Cleese as a crotchety 92 year old was pretty lame.  (I am a fan of most of Cleese's work.)  It was a Christmas present for my teenage son, who LOVES it and has watched it over and over again, so it was money well spent.  It's great to hear my boy singing the Lumberjack Song in German.",1168819200,8,394,4.144736842105263
2343971,1,B0009ZE9BW,"I purchased the set hoping to get the some of the best bits / most well known sketches of Monty Python and I have been sorely disappointed.  The interludes in Cleese's disc are ludicrous / unfunny, as are a number of them on other discs.  My suggestion would be for the owners of the material to have a fan vote for what is the best and make a set out of that so maybe we could get the Ministry of Silly Walks and other well known pieces rather than second rate renditions filmed at the Hollywood Bowl.",1168473600,4,502,4.164948453608248
2343972,4,B0009ZE9BW,The old routines have lost nothing.  They are still great.  The personal comments of the men makes it all much more hilarious.  You've got to be a fan to appreciate this stuff.,1167868800,3,176,4.4375
2343973,5,B0009ZE9BW,"I like the idea of showcasing each members talents sepratley, and Palin has always been my favorite Python.",1165190400,,107,5.0
2343974,4,B0009ZE9BW,Terry Gilliam's disc was about an hour too long. His odd animation is fantastic as a segue between acts but when it goes on and on and on...But the rest of the set is fantastic. A must have for any Python fan.,1158278400,3,209,4.0
2343975,3,B0009ZE9BW,"With all the Flying Circus episodes, albums, films, books ect. Why is it a must to realese another best of. As a huge pythoon fan, I don't really think there should be any. Nobody new should get this, and certainly not anyody who has been a fan for a long time. How bout instead of more best of compilations, maybe a realese of more solo stuff like Rutland Weekend Television, Bonzo music videos from DNAYS, At Last the 1948 show episodes, which there are more of than on the DVD's. There's also Out of the Trees, the unrealesed outtakes album, or maybe someone can find filmed but unused material from Flying Circus. But of course, when I went on amazon.com today, there's was The Monty POython Box Set. Don't get excited. It's Holy Grail, ANFSCD, and a Terry Gilliam movie Baron Machunakeiujb, whatever it's called.

Who cares and who the hell are buying these best of DVDs.",1133740800,5,876,4.579617834394904
2343981,4,B0009ZE9BW,"if you want to introduce a fan to the monty python family, this is a good start. This dvd has michael palin's best moments & is a great way to see the many characters that palin portrayed",1362355200,,187,4.081081081081081

2343983,4,B0009ZE9BW,"Years before ""Saturday Night Live"" in the United States, sketch comedy had a presence on British television with ""Monty Python's Flying Circus.""  The show ran on the BBC from 1969 to 1974, and this DVD set contains six hours of the best of the series.

There are six discs in this set, one each for the ""personal best"" of each of the main actors on the series--John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Graham Chapman.  In some spots, interviews with the actors are placed between the sketches.

""Monty Python"" contains plenty of absurd humor, sight gags, and stream of consciousness animations.  The show lampoons many groups in British society and would be politically incorrect by today's standards.  If you are unfamiliar with the show, you probably won't want to allow children to see it, as there is some foul language and sexual content.

As with even the best of ""SNL,"" the humor is hit-or-miss and much of what is here is not funny, but there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to make this set worth purchasing.",1333411200,,1049,4.826815642458101
2343984,5,B0009ZE9BW,"The DVDs arrived as promised. The first time I saw Monty Python on Television in Europe in the 1980s, I immediately took a liking to this group of incomparable comedic genius of Monty Python's Flying Circus. I could not have given myself a better present than hours of hysterical side-splitting laughter.

2343986,5,B0009ZE9BW,I love Monty Python so this was a must have for me. I laughed a lot and I will continue to enjoy it for many years to come.,1295222400,,123,3.4285714285714284
2343987,2,B0009ZE9BW,"When the original single Personal Best DVDs were first released a few years ago, I immediately snapped up the discs of my two favorite Pythons, Inspector Harry ""Snapper"" Organs, and Gordon Ottershaw. I watched one, and was thoroughly underwhelmed....since I already had owned the Complete Python both in VHS and later, DVD, I hoped for some new insight, maybe Pontius Pilate and Mr Creosote giving their own cosmic views on what they considered their best. No such luck. These are all just re-hashes, with no personal views at all, so here's another marketing ploy by Eric Idle Global Enterprises to wrest more hard-earned cash from the loyal followers of Python.
  Your Pythonic addiction would be better served by buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Ripping-Yarns/dp/B0009Y8JG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Ripping Yarns</a>, although I would highly recommend buying the Region 2 set from AmazonUK for one extremely important reason: no stupid, self congratulatory promos for the A & E Network or BBC America. (By the way, don't let the Region 2 thing put you off: it's surprisingly easy to hack a US DVD player into submission, enabling you to watch all sorts of great British programming not available in the US)
  Now I have to decide: what's a better deal, a new copy of this Personal Best set for $39.99, or the used copy for $149.99? Whoever the Marketplace seller is that thinks they can rip someone off for that much, all I can say is ""What a silly bunt!""",1267920000,2,1535,5.304526748971194
2343988,2,B0009ZE9BW,"I rarely rate things I buy at Amazon because for the most part I'm always happy with what I get.  This time I had to say something if for no other reason than to save someone else from purchasing this set and being disappointed.  First off Amazon is COMPLETELY blameless.  The set arrived on time as stated.
If you're a Monty Python fan and like to remember the old skits and hope to be able to see them then DON'T buy this set.  The skits are all cut up and shortened and bleed into totally unrelated skits.  The interviews are convoluted and void of any REAL knowledge.  After reviewing the entire set my opinion is that there is about one DVD's worth of value here if you combine all 6 DVDs and get rid of the chopped up scenes and skits and boring convoluted interviews.  I would not pay more than $10.00 for this set or you WILL be dissatisfied.

We love finding out what the Pythons feel are their own best, plus the intermittent interviews provide even more comedy!

As a huge Monty Python fan, I absolutely loved this collection.  I just watched Eric Idle's bit yesterday and it was top notch hilarity of course.  Even though my set was used it plays fine.",1242172800,,406,7.782608695652174
2343992,3,B0009ZE9BW,"Be aware that most (or at least many) of the sketches in this collection are clipped, i.e. they are EXCERPTS of the different sketches, and not necessarily the full sketches.  For example, the Dead Parrot sketch stops after the Cleese character throws the dead parrot in the air.  The rest is cut -- the funny euphemisms on dying (pining for the fjords, being an ex-parrot, etc.), as well as the the Bolton/Ipswich part, are NOT on here.",1239062400,10,437,4.662337662337662
2343993,3,B0009ZE9BW,"I was disappointed with how much filler was included. It's what aired on A&E (I think) and so it's more of a ""clip-show"" format. Lots of interviews and commentary breaking up what I really wanted to see--the sketches.",1233273600,3,217,4.7368421052631575

2343995,3,B0009ZE9BW,"I agree with another reviewer - it really would be beneficial to have some sort of index either as an insert or on the individual DVDs.  Some skits seem misplaced - I had considered certain skits to be the forte of different Python members than what ended up on other member's DVD.

Additionally, a few skits are truncated.  For example, the main skit I wanted (in full, thank you very much) was ""The Argument Clinic"".  Although this skit is primarily Michael Palin and John Cleese, it ends up on Graham Chapman's disc (he does appear for perhaps 60 seconds).  To add insult to injury, they stop the skit as soon as his part is over.  The skit itself continues on for another few minutes, and most of the truly funny parts never make it on this DVD.

All-in-all, this is a good sampler set but definitely falls short of capturing all the best.  Some selections are questionable at best (i.e., not the ones you remember as being truly hilarious), but it is a decent collection.",1210377600,6,976,4.537142857142857
2343996,5,B0009ZE9BW,"Do the 16 DVDs of the 16-Ton Megaset seem over-the-top to you, or at least more than you will ever watch? They do to me, which is why I purchased this 6-hour 6-DVD set (brand spankin' new, I might add) for the paltry sum of $8.99 (+$2.99 shipping). As of this writing, the box is still available at that price through Amazon from several sellers who bought it wholesale. Most of your favorite bits are here:

Confuse-a-Cat
Batley Townswomen's Guild Presents the Battle of Pearl Harbor
Upperclass Twit of the Year
Sit on My Face
Nudge Nudge
Lumberjack Song
Fish Slapping Dance
Vocational Guidance Counsellor Sketch
Ministry of Silly Walks
Dead Parrot Sketch
Exploding Penguin on TV Set
Spam
Argument Clinic
Dirty Hungarian Phrase-Book
Architect Sketch
Cheese Shop
Funniest Joke in the World
Spanish Inquisition
Lifeboat
Man with Three Buttocks
and much more

Plus, you get 45 of Terry Gilliam's best animations, amusing introductions by all of the Pythons (save the late Graham Chapman, whose best sketches the other five members chose), and several extras. Yes, some of the sketches are truncated, and John Cleese's introductions aren't funny, and the set could use an index, but for $9, this box is a great deal, so snap it up!
