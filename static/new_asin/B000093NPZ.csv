1878151,5,B000093NPZ,"I simply love sailor moon, specially the first season, because it's the closest to the novels. This season is about a real life young girl who must accept her fate and responsability in saving the world (raminds me about buffy) Unfortunately, in the US version, well, the story is modified to the extreme of showing a bunch of stupid gals with awfully dumb voices doing ridiculous stuff. This is the version you'll really love. But beware! This is not Disney! Little kids may not understand some things, so please use discretion, try yo watch it with them and be ready to explain if necessary. You'll enjoy it.",1052870400,3,610,4.710280373831775
1878152,4,B000093NPZ,"After about 4 years of waiting, on April 17th one of the greatest news stories appeared on eternalsailormoon.org. Finally on July 15th, I bought this set, neverminding what others had warned me about, but I guess I should have listened...
My opinions:
Packaging: B+
Extra's: D-
Video: D+
Audio: C-
Content: B-
Menuing: D
 Total: B
Packaging: The box is done pretty nicely. The two single cases are the ones that make the grade lower. It has ""A Sailor Moon like you've never seen before"" on the back with scene cathes with episode titles and dic information on the nack. The front is horribly done pictures of Sailor Moon ADV has produced. It's OK, but defenitly nothing to brag about. 8/10 80% B-
Extra's: In disc 4 & 8, they have ADV previews for upcoming series. I don't care, because the episodes itself what we expected. Still I'm dissapointed none of them are Sailor Moon realted 6/10 60% D-
Video: Dear god does this one suck the most. The video quality is the WORST I""VE EVER SEEN. Unlike Season 2, the colors are faded and the video looks like its being shown on a projector. Most people saying ""Well the shows 10 years old"" has nothing to do with it! ADV either got bad masters, or used bad equiptment. It has nothing to do with the show, I have fansubs with 5x better sound nad video, and their reccorded of of TV Ahashi the day they permeired.  I'd give it a D+ at best
Audio: Muffled, and staticky. What's more to say? 7/10 C- Yuck
Content: The 1st season is pretty good for the most part, there's some episodes that i don't care for. For the most part the subtitle track could use ALOT of work, It's horrible! Pioneer was way more accurate, and I didn't like how they used dub terms. They changed Moon Stick to Crescent Moon Wand, Sailor Soldier to Sailor Warrior... jeezz. Well, atleast they kept Negaverse, and SAilor Scout out. I would get rid of it the 1st day I got it if they put ""Sailor Scout"".  ADV completly failed to satisfy me 8/10 B-
Menuing: All I expected. If you've seen the PIONEER Movies (R, S, and the Super S movie, you'll know what I mean). There is just the main menu playing Moonlight densetsu, with a snapshot of the episode playing (A clip), with the title at the bottom. Pretty boring, It leaves a fansub feeling D, 6/10
MPAA Rating: NONE
My Rating: 12+.
ADV Rating: Suggested 15+, (although it also says: Contains Mild animated violence, and mature situations. Parental Guidence Suggested. )
Rated 15+ for: Fantasy Violence, theamatic elements, and subtle nudity and language.

1878154,5,B000093NPZ,"Sailor Moon has a bad reputation as a twee children's cartoon series. Hopefully the release of this 8 disc box set featuring all 46 uncut episodes (in Japanese Dialogue with English Subtitles) will help put the show's reputation to one side.
The series features a group of five schoolgirls who can transform into Soldiers with special powers. Their goal is to stop the efforts of Queen Beryl and Queen Metallia who wish to take over the Earth and claim the legendary Silver Crystal.
The animation varies from show to show but with the input of Ikuko Itoh (Maho Tsukai Tai) and Ando Masuhiro (Digimon Adventure) the quality is usually good.
Hopefully ADV will hurry up and release Sailor Moon R (episodes 47 - 89)",1052352000,4,712,4.75
1878155,4,B000093NPZ,"The audio quality sucks, but I'm not sure if that's because there's something wrong with the DVD itself or if it's because this is an older series (from the early 1990's)...Anyway, at some points, the characters' voices are muffled like they're talking through a pillow. Sometimes it's hilarious and sometimes it's annoying.

Other than that, the DVD works perfectly well - no scratches, no skipping, no lag between audio and visual, etc. The older style anime artwork is very elegant and beautiful, and it's funny to see what was socially acceptable and/or idealized in Japan back then.",1410134400,,587,5.051546391752577

1878157,4,B000093NPZ,"I remember back in 2004-2005 I got a boot-leg version (A very good bootleg at that!) of this and the 2nd season. However, this is what I think of the 1st season set.

The quality is good for it's time, and I admit the mono audio is something to get used to if you're well adjusted to surround sound. Ontop of this, the video quality isn't fantastic but it isn't bad either. In other words, the first two seasons uncut are in their original quality from 1992-1993 so it's to be expected for both to have aged a little. Plus, this was some time before the R2 quality was released (Japan release only, but you can find clips and episodes in such a format all over the net). Toei or DiC even probably had some bad tapes. As for subtitles, they are pretty well written and appear to lack any sort of error like some if not many anime boxsets do (bootleg or not.)

Would I recommend this:
Yes, however if you want to save your money for the first season that is being released by Viz in the fall, I'd advise getting the half boxsets. You get remastered visuals as well as possible audio remaster. But, if you're someone who can settle for something from a long time ago and prefer to keep away from bootleg sets (With Sailor Stars, you have no choice), then definitely get it.",1404345600,,1270,4.309623430962343

1878159,5,B000093NPZ,"Growing up, Sailor Moon was always one of my favorites.  Even though it was for girls, it was the best girls' cartoon ever.  I tried it because I really liked how it looked visually, & it did not disappoint.  I loved watching it on USA & later Toonami.  Then my parents got rid of cable, & I forgot about it but I had over a dozen episodes taped, & they survived to remind me of it.  Some of the episodes became a little cheesy with age but the good ones were still really good.  But then I heard about the butchering DIC had done to it, & tried the Japanese version, & it's superior for the first 2 seasons; I honestly prefer watching the movies in English & the third season I like watching in Japanese or English depending on the episode, but that's another story to be told another time.  We're here to discuss the first season.  I will review each of the seasons & the movies, & with each season I will compare it to the manga and talk about which one I like better & why.

Season 1 is where the story begins, with a girl named Usagi, who gets a visit from a talking cat who tells her she is really the super heroine Sailor Moon.  She then fights the Dark Kingdom lead by Queen Beryl & her right-hand man, Jedite, while being helped by the mysterious Tuxedo Mask.  Yeah, that's probably the most bizarre name for a superhero but who cares?  He's my favorite character in the whole show.  The first disc is honestly the worst disc in the set.  It's still good, it's just that it can feel repetitive at times.  Things do pick up when Sailor Mercury appears.  And then only two episodes after that we meet my favorite Martian (apart from the Martian Manhunter) Sailor Mars.  The duo becomes a trio, & the episodes become less formulaic & more entertaining.  Then the unthinkable happens; Jedite dies!  Okay, Queen Beryl puts him to sleep forever but still I wasn't expecting that.  We then get a new general, Nephrite.  He is much more interesting than Jedite ever was, namely how another general named Zoiscite loves to taunt him, & especially when he gets romantically involved with Usagi's best friend Naru.  This leads to a heartbreaking final episode where he turns good & rescues Naru from Zoiscite... then gets skewered by a cluster of giant thorns from one of Zoi's Youma.  As a kid this was very shocking to see.  Aside from being fairly graphic, it was really sad seeing him die.  This was when I realized Sailor Moon was no ordinary cartoon.  This episode (#24) is so good, even the dubbed version still packs a punch (and no, they didn't edit out the green blood; kudos to you DIC).  Then we meet my favorite of the girls, Sailor Jupiter as Zoiscite & his boyfriend Kunzite (yeah) go hunting for the 7 rainbow crystals that when combined will create the Silver Crystal.  Then after all the crystals are found we meet the last of the Sailors (for this season) Sailor Venus, AKA Sailor V, Usagi's heroine (NOTE: the author of the original manga wrote Sailor V first, but then switched over to writing Sailor Moon for reasons I don't know) and her talking cat Artemis, who despite the name is male.  Then there is a clash between our heroes and the Dark Kingdom for the crystals, & a bittersweet result.  The Sailors get the crystals & form the Silver Crystal & Queen Beryl kills Zoiscite, but Tuxedo Mask is captured after being badly wounded.  It turns out he's okay; Queen Beryl just brainwashed him into being her slave!  One of the most gut wrenching moments in the series for me was when he first hit Sailor Moon with a black rose.  This of course leads to a 3-part finale that remains the high point of this season.  I cried all throughout the last 2.  I actually cry a fair bit while watching the best of this show.  That's the beauty of this show; it's so varied.  Some episodes are hilarious, some episodes are just fun, some are exciting, some are romantic & some are just heartbreaking.  And I love all the characters.

Okay, so how does this compare to the manga?  Although the anime beats it by significantly more than a nose here, I can see why some people preferred the manga.  It was more condensed with no filler so it was more to the point, & I have to admit the 4 generals had a more interesting backstory than in the anime.  It was also even darker than the series, apart from the ending.  I have to admit, I thought the ending of the anime was better, as when the manga ends it's ready to lead right into the next arc but when the anime ends you're not sure if there is any more to see after it.  So, I'll just go with the anime, because of that & I like some of the characters (especially Sailor Mars) better in the anime.

So overall Sailor Moon is rightfully hailed as a classic.  & it's only going to get better; for the next 2 seasons at least.  Tune in next time, when we review my personal favorite season Sailor Moon R.",1378252800,2,4860,4.372767857142857
1878160,5,B000093NPZ,"Bought it used, since a new set was too dear, but, as adverted, plays like new, and the case wear mentioned in the ad hardly shows at all.
Only gripe--not the seller's fault--is the slightly noisy audio, possibly reflecting the prints AD Vision had to work with.
Anyway, glad to have this in my anime collection!",1370217600,,312,4.589285714285714
1878161,5,B000093NPZ,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She screamed loud enough to shatter a window.... this is a good thing. She was excited by the fact that it has the missing as well as the unedited episodes. For a fan like her, this was great and her first time seeing these episodes was awesome.

The only issue we really has was that the opening theme song wasn't as clear as the audio in the episode, but that was a very minor issue.... and not enough to effect this rating.",1366156800,,469,4.153846153846154
1878162,5,B000093NPZ,"I got this when it was originally released, but I began watching it again recently.

Yes, the sound is, well, off.  But remember...this is kind of old.  This has not been remastered for the highly digitized sound that we are now so accustomed to.

But you get used to it.  It doesn't take long, as these have stood the test of time and are still as great as they were during the first run.  Just remember...these are in the original Japanese, so you will be reading subtitles.  No big, as they are done well, so far as I can tell.  And you get to see all those great scenes that were cut out of the North American run.",1363824000,,618,4.177966101694915
1878163,4,B000093NPZ,"Nice quality. Those are two extra-wide DVD cases (not two paper sleeves with regular DVD cases inside). Each case has one half of the season on several DVDs.

I do wish the disc menu were a little nicer though. It's just a list of the episodes, and you can't turn on the subtitles from there, that has to be done with the remote for your DVD player. Not a huge issue, but a little inconvenient.",1353715200,,394,4.253333333333333
1878164,1,B000093NPZ,Yep I made the mistake of buying both the first and second seasons of ADVs IIRC unauthorized box sets. The video quality of both are horrid.,1320451200,,140,4.423076923076923
1878165,4,B000093NPZ,"I didn't have any issues with the sound or video quality, after all it IS early 90's (and better than some fan-sub VHS I've seen). I did however, have some issues with the subtitling, mainly the disregard of Japanese honorifics (-san, -chan, -sama, sen'pai, Onii-chan, etc) as they are important cultural references essential to the character's relationships with each other. Also issues with the subtitling's use of the English adaption's term ""Crescent Moon Wand"" when the characters are clearly calling it ""Moon Stick"" (in English) in the Japanese audio, and during the opening credits they continue to state the ending theme is Heart Moving, even after it's changed to Princess Moon. Sometimes in the course of the series characters will say phrases such as ""farewell"" or ""thank you"" in English, and the subtitles will use a similar word, even though they're already speaking English. My other issue was the shear size of the set. It's HUGE! The set is only 8 discs and the boxes could easily hold 40+ with the correct inner layout.",1300147200,,1036,4.959770114942529
1878166,4,B000093NPZ,"I grew up with the DIC dub version of ""Sailor Moon"", and loved it to pieces. As I grew older and found the wonderful world of anime in the original Japanese, I longed for the opportunity to experience ""Sailor Moon"" as it was meant to be. These DVDs are the answer to my prayers!

The two volume eight disc box set is simple, but delivers everything it advertises: all the episodes of the first season of ""Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon"" uncut, with Japanese language audio and English subtitles. The one major flaw I found with the box set is the audio - its' muffled, like listening to a stereo through headphone with the jack only halfway in. This, however, does not seem to be the a problem with the discs (as the audio in the menu screens is fine) but with the source of the episodes. If you're used to Dolby Surround Sound, the audio quality can be a little disconcerting, but just sit back and enjoy the episodes and soon you won't even notice the audio.

One more note: Don't be fooled by the pretty cartoon pictures. ""Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon"", unlike the dub-version ""Sailor Moon"" is not a kids show. There are themes and events which may be unsuitable for young children (unless your children are rather sophisticated). Keep this for your older kids, or even yourself to enjoy.",1297296000,,1285,4.558441558441558
1878167,3,B000093NPZ,I recently purchased this legit set of Sailor Moon that ADV put out years ago after watching a horrible bootleg of the season. Based on what i have watched the series seems to have not been touched not one bit since its 92' release. The audio appears to become muffled at times in which turning the volume up does help a little bit. The video is in excellent quality for a show back from the early 90s. The 6 disc come in 2 thick dvd cover boxes. The outer box artwork is beautifully done. The disc art is beautifully done. Based off of what i've seen the show is watchable its just sometimes you have to turn the volume up to be able to hear the sometimes muffled audio. A couple of things to take into consideration is this boxset is the original uncut Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon it is done in monoaural (SP?) and also this show was not remastered on these boxsets unlike everything drangonball. What they basically did was took this show that originally aired in japan and slapped it on dvds with subtitles. Also note that season 2 of this series which is also done by ADV is of the same qulity of this boxset. Now season 3 and 4 done by Geneon (aka Pioneer) the audio and video quality are actually alot better than the first two seasons.,1296864000,6,1243,4.339055793991417
1878168,1,B000093NPZ,"I was finally able to sign into my ancient account.
I bought this in 2006 expecting to have the real Sailor Moon dvds I had previously seen in Best Buy. The image for this product is not only incorrect but deceitful since this picture only depicts the real edition. When I received this in the mail the box art was different and was only on four discs. At the time I didn't know anything about Bootlegs and thought maybe this is what they looked like from the inside. Wrong.
It was a year or so later that I found out I didn't have the genuine dvds for Sailor Moon and had overpaid for fakes. Ones that can be made with as little as $10. Maybe more if they're really trying to make them look legit. Not only did I get cheated out of my money but thought I had the real thing. I wish I had known at the time so I could send them back but at least I can warn you all now. This is not the real release for Sailor Moon and if you're a real anime fan you'll support our dying industry *it is in trouble* and not buy bootlegs. There's a chance Sailor Moon could be coming back globally due to a recent rise in interest for the anime. That means there's a possibility Stars will make it to North American shores since we have way more screwed up anime now than gender bending scouts. If I had the chance I'd give this seller a piece of my mind and a kick to the [...] for being a threat to my favorite industry.
Never before has the phrase, ""If only I knew then what I know now"" been so true but lesson learned. You're being cheated out of your money by buying bootlegs, anime industries are trying harder to bend to our budget so we don't turn to these losers, and if you suspect you purchased a bootleg you have every right to get your money back. A fake is a fake and we deserve better.",1292716800,5,1782,4.07977207977208
1878169,5,B000093NPZ,"Okay, first off I would love to say that I'm a super Sailor Moon fan! The price of this box set may turn some people off, but not me. And if you are a true Sailor Moon fan, change your dislike towards expensive things and save up for this set! It's totally worth it.
The storyline is amazing! It's cute and shows the importance of friendship and good vs. evil. This is not really a version for children (it's rated 13+, more aimed towards teens) but I am going to save this in mint condition for if I am ever to have a child they would be able to experience a bit of my childhood.
I noticed from some reviews, there are complaints about the audio and the quality of the video. I beleive most of those people are overexagerating because it really isn't that bad. It may not be the best in the world compared with the newer animes but you must keep in mind how old this show is. It's a classic! I've had DVDs of other classics but their audio or picture wasn't the best in the world, but it didn't stray me away from it.
I recommend this set for anyone who wants to watch the raw, unedited version of Sailor Moon... The way it was meant to be seen.

A++++++ :)

1878171,5,B000093NPZ,"This season is wicked cool.  I have loved Sailor Moon since watching it as a kid in the early 90's.  But unlike the english dubbed version, the uncut subtitled version is sooooo much better.  I highly reccomend buying it.  The set is worth the price as it is OOP and a collector's item.  Though SMR boxset is more rare.  The storylines may be along the same from episode to episode (a monster tries to take something or destroy something and the sailor scouts defeat it) but the plot is pretty cool.  It does have some language and the only nudity is the outline of the scouts boobs as they transform.  It deals with the death of the scouts a lil differently than the DIC kiddie version did.  It is more rough around the edges per se.  The english version seriously dumbed down a great anime.  I highly reccomend this set to any true fan of the series as this is a true piece of art.  Sailor Moon practically set the standard for the Magical Girl/Romance genre in anime.

But on the side note if you are collecting then make sure the seller is noting the item as an official region 1.  My best advice is to ask for pics of the item and not just a stock photo.  Region 1 releases DO NOT have ""perfect collection"" on the cover.  There are 8 discs in a region 1 release and there is one episode left out by ADV on this release.  It is an episode #'ed in the 60's ( I think #65 but it could be 67)  ADV is the only company to have released an offical R1 box set of the uncut seasons 1 and 2 (Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon R respectively).

If a seller lists it as a 4 disc set, The Perfect Collection, or Region 0 it is a FAKE!  They will try to tell you it is an Import but it is not.  Don't be fooled.  The only season that one would have to get as an ""import"" is Stars since it was never subtitled or released in N America.",1255305600,,1820,4.067605633802817

1878176,3,B000093NPZ,"This is meant to be a quick review. This product uses the original Japanese audio for the episodes, and it is quite poor. This is not the NA production company's fault. Basically, the audio sounds like it was ripped from a VHS tape, and honestly I don't know why the original series had such poor audio. The show came out in the early 90's and I have seen clips of the show on Japanese sites and the poor audio is there as well. Other than that, I have no qualms with this collection.",1219017600,,484,4.21505376344086
1878177,5,B000093NPZ,"I barely remember much from when I watched the English dub version of Sailor Moon as a kid, and perhaps that is a blessing! From the little clips I caught of the English version it is absolutely HORRIBLE!

So when I got into a Sailor Moon mood I turned to the Japanese version, subbed. This anime has so many great moments in it, it'll make you laugh and, possibly, cry at times. I became so addicted to this classic anime that I just had to own the DVDs! I ordered this season first and watched all the episodes in a few days and was left wanting more.

This boxset is great! It has eight DVDs in it containing all of the first 46 episodes, uncut! Some people have complained about the quality of the sound and the fact that it is in mono, but it doesn't bother me. There is a reason for the volume button. ;) There is no English audio, just Japanese with English subtitles.

For those that are not aware, this boxset is the ONLY official Region 1 release. It has eight discs and is made by ADV. So anyone selling the first season with four discs is selling a bootleg. Since Sailor Moon DVDS are no longer made, the originals go for a high price, some times over 200 dollars! The bootleg versions are usually priced a little lower, so watch out for what you buy if you are planning on getting this or any other SM sets!",1218240000,4,1320,4.23015873015873

(Stupidly, I thought that turning the volume up would increase its clarity. Nope.) I dare say, it'd almost be more enjoyable to listen to it in English!

1878181,3,B000093NPZ,"Like many members of the ""classic Toonami"" generation, I grew up watching the hacked-up English dubbed version of Sailor Moon. That said, while I'm glad that the original version of Sailor Moon has finally been released over here, the DVD sets put out by ADV leave much to be desired. I know that this series is over 15 years old and originally aired in monaural sound, but on these DVDs, the show looks and sounds quite murky. Surely it's not THAT hard to put out a mono track with some degree of clarity, right? Even FUNimation's recent Dragon Ball Z sets do better on their mono Japanese tracks. While we're at it, the show's opening credits sequence is normally placed between the episode preview and the ""Usagi intro"", but here, it's placed before both the episode preview and the ""Usagi intro"". What's up with that?

Also, to anyone attempting to buy this from a Marketplace seller: beware of sellers claiming to sell ""import editions"" or hawking these sets for under $100. ADV released this set with Region 1 (North America/etc.) encoding, and THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN ""IMPORT EDITION"" UNLESS YOU ARE BUYING A REGION 2 PRODUCT! These sellers (such as ""monscreate"" and ""amazon-joe"") are selling BOOTLEGS under the guise of legitimate releases, and they do this for many other titles such as Full Metal Panic!, Last Exile, and Samurai Champloo (three-disc releases of 26-episode series are also a dead giveaway because this invariably results in decreased audio/video quality). In short: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.",1186272000,7,1545,4.8522727272727275

If you're a Sailormoon fan, I highly recommend buying it (you know what you get anyway, so there's no need to complain). This is a matter of taste. Some people love this show even though it is repetitive and has very little plot except for the last few episodes.

The point is, if you want the dumbed down version of this series, you aren't buying the right DVDs.  These are only in Japanese, so Tracey Moore and Terri Hawkes shouldn't be credited.

Anyway, the real Sailor Moon is so much better than the American dubbed version, as fans will find as they watch these DVDs.

I won't give away too much, but the end is much more intense. The dubbers chopped up tbe last three episodes and made them into two.  And also, you can sigh with relief that there is no 'Sailor Moon says' at the end of any of these episodes!",1152489600,17,885,4.49375

I was thrilled to find out that the first two seasons of SM would finally be released, uncut and subtitled, to the mainstream masses. I had purchased a few fansubs but didn't like the difficulty with which I had to find them.

I suppose the quality of SM season 1 is a bit shabby, but keep in mind that this is relatively old footage: the first season of SM is almost 15 years old, and has probably been sitting in a vault at Toei for almost as long. I for one, find that a small price to pay to finally be able to see Sailor Moon as it was meant to be seen, and not DiC-ified.

For Parents: I wouldn't buy this for young kids...the sailor moon that once aired on cartoon network was a cheasy dubbed over and cut up version that was designed for kids...this set is the real deal and include..violence, death, gore, gay relationship, lesbian referneces (and relationships in season 2 and 3), and panty shots

It is a great dvd I wish I had known about it right when it came out. Perhaps one day they'll improve the sound quality. But I think it is an exageration to say that you have to turn the tv all the way up to hear it.

So after watching Ranma i pop this in and, well i had to invite a friend over to laugh at the mediocrity. it's not a question of masculinity it's a question of realizing quality. the old sailor moon saver is""well for it's time it was good"" yet heres Ranma, proof that it's bad, and a short while later Cowboy Bebop.the show has repetitiveness all over. monster shows up, girls transform, girls get nearly defeated, tuxedo idiot changes tide, monster dies, rinse and repeat. at leasty inuyasha switches it up a little. if u have fond memories of this, you may enjoy bits of it, the 30% that has a real plot, but make sure you have plenty of alcohol

And thanks to that introduction, my anime collection has flurished. I've seen all of the North American dub and I really wanted to experience Sailor Moon in it's orignal anime form. I say if you are a hard core fan like I am then it shouldn't matter if there are a few technical problems with this DVD. Of course I didn't spend the amazon.com price on it. I did order through one of amazon's sellers and only spent $40.00 on it. But it was well worth the price. So if you love anime and want to add this to your collection, I say go for it. The show is 13 years old and in truth you probably won't find it in great quality. I wasn't willing to let this classic disappear before I could add it to my collection.

Every element of this series (especially the sailor costumes) is now part of pop culture.  What other anime can you just mention girls (or shoujo) anime and someone will say Sailor Moon?

The Sailor Moon series has suffered greatly through its time (with DIC chopping it up)so ADV being the useless money hungry hounds they are, charging over $100 for an original is a load of crap, cos they know people (especially diehards)are going to pay whatever for it.  No wonder the skint people are turning to bootlegging.  Anime and manga collecting already is an expensive hobby, so why are they letting down the fans like this?  They know Sailor Moon has a massive fanbase worldwide so why were there so few copies made?

I'll point out that Sailormoon was recorded in mono, and there is no stereo version anywhere for the uncut version; eventhough mono is not really supposed to sound as horrible as it does in this set's audio, it is not ADV's fault... TOEI, the Japanese company that produced the show, gave ADV the worst audio/video masters they had; so unless they do a re-release using the masters for the recent Japanese DVDs, you'll have to settle for this...

As for the content: Sailormoon is great, and in my opininon what's appealing about it is that eventhough it's not a kid's show, the characters are so childish that you don't have another option but to laugh... hard... until you stomach hurts...

This is one show you'll keep watching and watching and watching... and you'll never get tired...

And the best part about this was that I paid less than $60 here at Amazon, about $50 less than Best Buy.",1089504000,,813,4.119496855345912
1878219,5,B000093NPZ,"This box set features the entire Sailor Moon Season One, all 46 episodes, all uncut in original Japanese audio with English subtitles.
Reasons why you should buy this boxset-
*Because it's subtitled
*Because it's uncut
*Because it contains several episodes that were never shown in America
And most importantly...
*Because it's Sailor Moon!
I highly recommend this to any Sailor Moon fan (ages 14+) who is looking to see the REAL first season of Sailor Moon, not the choppy, edited, dubbed, HORRIBLE Dic version.
Hope that helped.

1878220,5,B000093NPZ,I am a big sailor moon fan and have seen all the seasons in japanese (including StarS).  After all the times ive watched sailor moon since 1995 ive realized that season 1 is its purest form.  Lets face it the American dub sucks.  But in this version its the japanese uncut which i can say is 100% better than the stupid dubbed way.  People are complaining about the sound and what not... live with it and grow up.  if your a true sailor moon fan then who cares how they made it whats happening i the show should have your full attention not how the screen is and if its not loud enough turn the volume up its not rocket science.  This is a really good season and as i said its sailor moon in its purest form all i can say is don't pay $150 for it when you can get it on ebay for $50-$70 and 99.9% of the time you won't have any problems with ebay ive been on ebay for quite a long time and haven't had any problems yet.,1089158400,,919,3.967391304347826

Given that it's extremyl long, I was really happy to find that they have decided the realease the series in boxed sets. Don't be fooled by akiyuki's review. This boxed set is great. Do use akiyuki's review as a warning though. DO NOT BUY THE BOXED SET IF IT'S PRICED AT $50!!! It's proabably an illegal copy which is why the audio and video was of such a low quality.

Also The Dic Dubbs leave out so much content that The Original Japanesse Version has Its Pathetic.  This Has to be the best sailor moon colection that there Is,1087257600,2,367,4.154929577464789
1878223,4,B000093NPZ,"Personally, I would buy this if your just one of the unlucky or unfornate people that never got to see the true last episode, aka, ""Day of Destiny"" which in reality is two episodes long.  It will bring you to tears or VERY close to them.
And yes the sound is lacking, and it does look like someone stood there with a camera and shook it as it was filmed, but trust me, it's easy to get over when you see some of your favorite, classic episodes of Sailor Moon, espically the uncut versions and ""lost episodes"" such as the one where Sailor Moon goes to a bar, the one where the Mars, Mercury, and Moon go to a haunted house on their vaction, or the one with Sailor Venus past, which episodes  never aired in the dubbed English version.
The jokes are funnier, and the episodes are relitivly longer because everything was left in (any nudity or violence), so there won't be that thing where you watch Sailor Moon says and are just like ""Hey!  That never happened in the show!""
And another thing is all the sexes are finally correct, such as Ziocite or however you spell it being a male instead of a female.  Scary but true.
But as I stated, anyone who has always wondered what was the real ending of ""Day of Destiny"", with each Sailor's death and the true fight behind Serena and Darian (which was awsome) not to mention the Japanese music, (or the orginal Sailor Moon Music) than definatly by this box set...then go for the second season.",1085011200,5,1435,4.383458646616542

1878225,4,B000093NPZ,"Naoko Takeuchi's Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon, the uncut edition. Is finally available in the United States for the first time. Though in Japanese with English subtitles, it's totally worth viewing considering how damaged it's been here in the States.
There are even some lost episodes and jokes that are in the set. Some of the episodes' format isn't that great in some episodes. However, if you can get past that then it's defiantly worth seeing.
This is a really good introduction to kids ( especially girls. ) Who want to get interested in the anime/manga media. All though there are a tun of cult favorites to pick out and watch.
 I really do like this one even though I haven't seen it in a while.
The Japanese don't stray from topics like homosexuality ( though not dealt in this season,) and other subjects that us Americans often stray away from in children's media.
 A lot of fun for girls that dream bout being a supper heroin and their prince.
The only thing I can suggest is maybe getting it some were like BestBuy or Target and so forth, because the price is much better.",1080691200,,1084,4.582474226804123
1878226,5,B000093NPZ,"I just got this for christmas last year (and sorta broke the casing...wouldn't reccomend opening two of the things in a case at once, it won't work...*sheepish look*...it was all my fault, so I don't expect you to have the same problem...) and I love it so much! I've only watched it once all the way through, but that's more because I have lots to do when I'm at home than that I don't like it, because I do.
The audio isn't bad....well, that's a lie, it's bad, but if you crank up the volume on the TV and DVD it comes out just fine(and if you have a stereo hooked up it sounds REALLY cool)and a side note, watch out for the opening and ending songs, they get LOUD if you follow the above suggestion....unless you like that kind of thing. *shrugs* Oh, and in certain places there is a crackling sound in the background, but that goes away as soon as the ""camera"" view is moved, so no biggie.
The video definately isn't the greatest, but I've seen WAY worse...have any of you only had one version of the Labyrinth, taped off of Disney chanel back when there were no commercials on a very old VCR for several years?  Well if not, I can tell you for sure that that is much, much worse.  In certain scenes it gets a little blurry, but this was an old anime, what more can you expect?
Yet, in spite of all these faults, this is still a 5 star DVD.  Where the Audio and Video is lacking, the episodes are definately worth it.  I really love the one where they go to a hotel where the workers dress as monsters (which really freaks Usagi, and sometimes Rei, out, which makes for some super funny moments) I'd tell you the name of the episode, but that would mean moving and I'm just not up to doing that for the moment ^.^ Plus you get all of the cut episodes (including the mentioned one above)
In short, I'd definately reccomend this DVD!",1079308800,2,1835,4.249283667621777
1878227,4,B000093NPZ,"I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of some slight mistakes in the subtitles--once every few episodes there will be an error (incorrect punctuation/sentence structure, that kind of thing).  I saw that someone else mentioned being disappointed with the sound, but the sound didn't seem especially bad to me.
The packaging is beautifully designed; the episode guide is cool and useful; the DVDs are set up so layer changes aren't apparent; the chapter breaks occur in logical places; the shows themselves are great.  It's wonderful to be able to see everything as it was meant to be seen.  I was surprised that Zoicite is not as different from the dubbed [female] Zoicite as I expected him to be, but the season climax/finale is dramatically different from the dubbed version.
Some of the funny lines from the dubbed version (like ""Hey there, Sailor Ladies--goin' my way?"") are gone, naturally, but there are occasional gems in the subtitles.  It's great fun to see Sailor Moon say ""D'oh!""
If I could give this 4 3/4 stars, I would, but I can't quite justify giving it 5 because I think the subtitles could use just a bit more proofreading.",1076803200,,1152,4.803030303030303
1878228,3,B000093NPZ,I can now say that I have seen all the episodes of the first season.  I never knew that some of the episodes could be so diferent.  In japanesse I love it it is great to see what they are really like.  I have to admit though the quality wasn't the greatest thing going.  The quality could have been fixed and I would have perfered it in english but sing the editors won't do all the episoded to get them all I had to buy them in japanesse well I still love it anyway.,1074816000,,467,3.9361702127659575
1878229,5,B000093NPZ,"Here we go folks. This is what you can expect from the DVD's and why people are giving such differing ratings, comments for them. The audio isn't that good simply because it requires that you turn your television volume up alot. However I do believe if you have the tv on a higher volume setting then even japanese would understand the words being said. In that case the volume isn't an issue if you think about how impossible it is to get the episodes anyother way. The picture isn't really that bad. Some people have said it is poor or not to grand, but if you take the time to really think about it the pictures very good. In fact one can say the picture alone would've been worth purchasing this BOX SET for. My suggestion would be if you have a computer then use a program like E-Color to adjust your monitors settings so that it will bring out the best possible picture. The differences when using E-Color as compared to just leaving the settings alone is remarkable! I have E-Color and using that made everything so clear, crisp, and fine. I am going to give this 5 out of 5 because if the audio can be dealt with by using headphones and turning the volume up then the sets not so bad that it needs to drop 1 rating.

The audio is better than when you saw it on tv and the visual quality is really good too.",1072915200,,374,4.0675675675675675
1878232,4,B000093NPZ,"Okay guys.. I have been waiting for this for years. YEARS. I watched this show when DiC bought the rights and played it at 6:30 AM and then when Cartoon Network played it on Toonami. Over and over. I've been bleeding and sweating Sailor Moon for years. but despite my love for the series, the corny English-ized version started to pain me. Especially when they came out with the S series. Being beat in the face with the incestuous Amara and Michelle made my innards hurt (to their credit, they managed to find a decent voice actress for Hotaru.) But lo! Now ADV brings us the series uncut and Japanese! Huzzah!
Be warned.. the sound quality is second-rate. No digital-remastering on this set, friends. I would have prefered they put a bit more effort into this. The dvd menus were pretty blase as well. Not what I expected from ADV at all after seeing thier release of Excel Saga. The overall quality is reminiscent of a fan job. But.. it's my favourite series, and if you love Sailor Moon, I would suggest it to you. Wait until you see the episodes DiC left out!",1072483200,3,1064,4.489690721649485
1878243,5,B000093NPZ,"I don't have the Sailor Moon DVD on all 5 of the seasons but I do have them on video(I bought it on Ebay). I also got the Sailor Moon SuperS specials including ""Ami-chan no hatsukoi""(""Ami-chan's first love"") on DVD (I got that from the fansubbed VKLL, which appears later on in the season or maybe on the DVD you guys purchased). I am giving the whole Sailor Moon series 5 stars instead of the DVD, since I don't have the DVD and I heard that the audio isn't that great. Anyway, I love the Sailor Moon series in Japanese, even though the English version got me started on it.  I didn't like the original Sailor Moon at first, when I got the Sailor Moon R movie subtitles on VHS, I picked up the wrong box! But I got used to reading the subtitles and I love the song, ""Moon Revenge"". Now, I think the English version also sucks, especially the first and second season.  On the first season, they totally skipped over about 6 episodes, especially the important episode about Minako's past.  I love the Japanese seiyuu (voices), Kotono Mitsuishi's voice (Usagi) and Rica Fukami (Minako) the most.  I really wish (in a way) that America could come out with Sailor Stars so I could compare it to the original version.  The original is always the best anyway.  The original also brings out the best in the characters, unlike the American version. Despite the DVD, every Sailor Moon episode is the best.  Just why did it have to take so long to come out with it?  Here I am 22 and when it came to America in 1995, I was 13, but the original release, I was about 10.

This is what you *almost* have here!  The original music, voices, cut scenes, cut EPISODES from the English variation (6 out of 46, if you count that the last episodes were cut down into one episode in the English version).  However, the translators were lazy. Anyone who knows anything about Sailor Moon (or a little Japanese, which I do) knows that she nevers says any of that Champion of love and justice crap.  Usually, what she's actually saying is something along the lines of ""pretty soldier in a sailor suit.""  ""Sailor fuku bishoujo senshi.""  They just copied that other phrase, among several others, direct out of the English version.  The subtitles aren't accurate to what they are saying in Japanese.  However, some things were changed and translated properly.  It's still quite disappointing, though, that you'll have to learn Japanese or have someone who knows Japanese already to explain to you what they're actually saying without subtitles still.  Way to go, ADV.  However, it's still great!  I mean, hearing the original voices and everything is *so* worth it.  Even if the subtitles are sad (especially when the title on the cover of the DVD boxes is a mark off of her popular quote that they maimed), there's so much you miss in the English version.  DIC cuts out entire back stories and supports to the plot.  If you're a real Sailor Moon fan, you're gonna want to check this out!",1065830400,5,1596,4.794871794871795

The back of each case has the episode name, number, and disc.  On the inside, there is a brief summary with landmarks.  And you CAN turn of subtitles even though it's not a menu option.  I'm not sure all DVD remotes have this button, but if you press 'Subtitle' you can turn them off.  Now for the bad.  The audio really sucks (VERY soft), and the picture could use some work.  There aren't really any menus or extras, and *what* is with that trailer in the beginning of each disc?  ""What is Anime?""

ADV could have gotten better quality just by ripping the R2 import DVD's, slapping a sub-title track on it, and selling that.

The sound is so bad I can barely hear the vocals and the background music isn't much better.  I don't know why there is a ""dolby"" symbol on the box.  Secondly, there are no special features or even creative title screens.  I would have loved to see fan-art/ commenatary / or optional english dialogue for comparison.

My only concern with this series seems to be in the Audio department, it looks like the original was made but the sound never was that important so the audio got recorded in a monaural way (sounds that way) when you see the series youll have to turn up the volume a bit in order to liston properly. but hey its the original series so no matter.",1060732800,3,996,4.297872340425532

Other than that the DVDs are great, I just wish they would have spent a little more time fixing the sound.. its a bit overpriced ... as well, but the set is def. worth it once you get past the poor sound.",1060646400,,515,4.16

ADV strikes again, first botching the sound on the Farscape: Season 1 boxed set, now completely screwing up the audio on the Sailor Moon Season 1 set.  And I'm not talking about minor audio problems - the entire audio track is garbled, muffled, and sounds absolutely dreadful.  And I'm not even a nitpicky person here, I don't usually go overboard demanding amazing quality, it depends on the thing being released.  But it's just BAD.  So much so I'd return it if you could return opened DVDs.
ADV obtained low quality master videos from Toei, but instead of demanding the higher quality ones used for DVD releases in Region 2, they kept em, didn't try to improve them, and still charged an arm and a leg for the season.  It's way below the quality of Pioneer's releases of Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon SuperS.
Furthermore, ADV has not included the next episode previews, and they've put the opening preview after the opening titles (when they should be first!).

1878268,4,B000093NPZ,"This DVD is awesome..the show in japanese is SOO much better than the DiC version.....I first started watching sailor moon when i was 5 years old (i am now 15)which was when it was airing daily in Italy...yes i used to live there... well, a year later i came to america and was VERY annoyed to find out that the show was airing @ 6:30 in the morning..i still woke up to see it though lol...I knew even then that many things had been changed..but once I started to get seasons 4&5 on DVD i realized how much i had REALLY been missing (i.e. a LOT) ...so my advice to a fellow moonie who has been forced to see dic's version of this show is GET THIS DVD SET!!! it is worth it even if the audio and image quality is kinda poor(which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5)..but remember that the show is more than 11 years old-just don't expect any treasure planet animation-while tempted though u may be to buy the 2nd season dubbed..DONT...it will be better to wait...i waited for 2 years to see the first two seasons subbed....now i saw the first and i am very very very happy i waited!!!
I really really hope that ADV or Pioneer will release season 5...I have it in VCD format but its kinda crappy(the VCD not the season..the season was AWESOME..even better than S possibly)..::praying::",1059609600,12,1286,4.340248962655601

1878281,5,B000093NPZ,"Sailor Moon was the one that started it all, in my opinion. Without Sailor Moon hitting America, i doubt that other anime such as Revolutionary Girl Utena and Steel Angel Karumi and Fushigi Yuugi would have had a chance to rise to the level of fan recognition they are at.
Tsukino Usagi is a crybaby who gets bad grades, loves to eat, and always stops at Crown to play the latest video games. She's an ordinary girl with ordiary crushes (Motokioni for one) and ordinary problems. Until she rescues a black cat from mean little kids. Then everything changes. Usagi has responsibility, and the fitting word becomes ""Moon Prism Power, Make UP!"". Along with the other Sailor Senshi that she meets along the way, with the help of the kuroneko Luna, Usagi becomes a heroine that all girls can look up to.
The original is so much better than the dubs that were put out on tv, because you get to see everything in its entirity to the romance between Usagi and Mamoru to the deaths of the Inner Senshi. Its all very emotional, and the music adds to the experience. Bishoujo Senshi Seeraa Muun was not intended to be chopped up to feed to mass markets over seas, it was intended to be a beautiful story about people growing up, and even in Season 1 its apparent. I reccomend this to every diehard moonie and to all those who have a little Usagi in side of them.",1059091200,5,1351,4.451612903225806

Besides the (not excellent) audio quality of the Opening and Closing themes, I can't really see a reason to not enjoy this if you're a Moonie at heart. Although there was one thing I noticed: when the Ending song changed, they didn't update the credits in the Opening. When the song was Princess Moon, the credits still read Heart Moving.

I LOVE being able to watch the full episodes, uncut, and most importantly MAKING SENSE!  I never really understood how bad the dub was until these arrived.  Everything is clear now.... and the acting is suberb!
Like others, I would like to point out that it has been 11 years since the show originally aired, so the animation is not top of the line anymore.  However, I have not experienced any trouble with the sound.  (My TV is also about 20 years old, so maybe I""m just used to [bad] sound)

And in the name of the moon, I shall punish you!""  Instead it reads, ""Sailor warrior for love and justice, Sailor Moon.  In the name of the moon, I shall punish you!""

1878286,5,B000093NPZ,"I never liked the US version of sailor moon. In fact it nearly put me off the entire show, though I loved the Manga.
But finally I got to see the entire first series without the stupid (and pointless) cuts.
The soundtrack is supposed to be sterio, but is infact mono.  The quality of the soundtract is what you would expect of a tv show from the early nineties, so I can live with that.
The subtitles are good, though I'm certain the characters don't say ""shoot"".  This is strange as in one episode, a character is called a Bastard (just like Me!) In fact other than that, and in one place where the sailor soldiers rent a ""Pension"" (should be mansion!!!) the subtitles are well done.
If you are expecting a lot of extras, then forget it.  There aren't any, except some ADV previews.  But who cares?
The print is fine, with no DVD artifacts, just a few minor scratches on the original.  One episode also judders slightly at the start.
If you like the awful dub, then you may not like this.  There is more violence and some gay references (but you probably knew that zoisite was gay, didn't you.)
I love this set and if anyone from ADV reads this, please hurry up and release season 2 - uncut!",1058659200,,1192,4.346846846846847
1878287,4,B000093NPZ,"I loved Sailor Moon when it came out in the US back in 1993. I watched it religiously (at 6:30 in the morning!), and it was part of the reason why I really got into anime. So, when I saw the 1st Season beckoning me at the Suncoast booth (at Anime Expo) I knew I had to get it.
While Sailor Moon is formulaic in all its incarnations, I'd honestly forgotten exactly HOW original much of the 1st season was. Usagi is lazy, whiny and definitely NOT super-hero material. She changes into someone who her friends can depend on when the chips are down, but does a lot of struggling and whining on the way. Her core group of friends are introduced in this season and it's a joy to see all of them interact, whether it is Rei and Usagi fighting again, or Luna praising Ami while sighing over Usagi's mistakes.
However, don't take that to mean that there is no formula -- there is. However, there are several arcs within the first season, depending on which of Beryl's minions are in charge. Jadeite had his mission of collecting energy, and Nephrite with his search for the Silver Crystal. Zoisite found the Rainbow Crystals, etc. Within each seperate episode, Usagi and her friends find time to shop, argue, fall in love and eventually save people from the Dark Kingdom.
The DVDs themselves are bare-bones. The episodes are all that are given to us -- no extras, no interviews, not even a character guide. The visuals are dated (as this show dates from over 10 years ago!) but it is quite recognizably Sailor Moon. However, it was really the audio I had a problem with -- MONO! The voice acting is wonderful, but I could barely hear it sometimes! Some episodes are better than others, and there are less problems as the series goes on, but in general, the sound quality is quite bad. This probably wasn't ADV's fault -- maybe the masters they had?
In any case, the first season of Sailor Moon is a classic which still has the power to make me nostalgic and make me tear up a little. Mamoru and Usagi's growing affection and past&present love is something which makes this series really wonderful to watch, and of course, the fact that the last 3 episodes are UNCUT and in Japanese is something to treasure.",1058572800,,2198,4.4975
1878295,5,B000093NPZ,"Just think after eleven years!  But eleven years has been a while...since then, anime has become very much advanced in animation and even character design.  Most of America doesn't get too many opportunities to see the quality and drama that comes with earlier anime, even those aimed toward younger kids.  I love the nostalgia that comes with the almost gritty opening song and the cute, chubby Usagi with unrealistic proportions (her head!).  The romantic handpainted background from the end brings back memories of anime like those of ""A Dog Called Flanders"" or a childhood favorite: Princess Sara.  There's just a sweetness and realistic portrayal of emotions for the sake of emotion rather than flashy gimmicks; its depth goes beyond words.  It's not forced philosophy, it's just life with a beautiful twist.  For those looking into a beautiful, sincere (there's just really no other way to put it!), classy storyline and storytelling with quirky characters that are simply unforgettable, you simply CANNOT pass up such an opportunity.  For those already familiar with anime...this is a CLASSIC!  Mind you, this is a show aimed at 7 year olds...I'm sure kids who can read words like ""Supreme"" and ""inspired"" can handle it (since there seem to be quite a few warnings on subject matter).",1058572800,,1291,5.080568720379147

1878301,5,B000093NPZ,"Being a huge fan of Sailor Moon I of course would have a say about ADV producing the first season of Sailor Moon on DVD. The first and best thing about it is that American veiwers will get the chance to see the first season of Sailor Moon in it's original Japanese animated version. Those of you who have been hanging of the English TV version of Sailor Moon are in for a real treat when you see the original Japanese version. Every goot element about Sailor Moon will increase 10-fold. All the [bad] English voices will no longer plauge your ears...All of the sounds in the original are the crisp, splended sounds of the original. I was outraged when I first heard the English voices. They don't sound ANYTHING like they should be. Most of the senshi sound like 30-year-old women, and not 14-year-old teenagers like they should sound. Also the theme song won't make you sick to your stomach, with some crappy actors saying 'she is the one named Sailor Moon' over and over again.
Once again, for those of you who have only watched Toonami or Kid's WB to get episodes of Sailor Moon, you will see the episodes that just couldn't quite make it on TV. I don't see why they didn't make it though. If they are dubbed just as bad as the rest of the English version is, then they should meet American TV critira. If I remember correctly, they didn't end show 6 of the episodes. So for all of you dubbies, you will see the missing episodes.
Along with the Japanese version, the animation qaulity will also increase 10-fold. All of the rough, and ragged English version images will go 'bye-bye'. And instead they will be replaced with beautiful, flowing color images. A true treat for any anime fan, not just Sailor Moon fan. Along with better picture qaulity, all of the scenes that were cut from the show when they went on TV, you will finialy be able to see. The lines on all of the senshi when the transform will be present again, unlike the TV version.
All in all, it may of been 11 years before the first season of Sailor Moon made it on DVD in Japanese, but it will be well worth it in the long run. One of the best anime series created will get the credit it has long deserved in America. All of the errors that DIC created, I can only pray that ADV didn't screw them up any more than they already were. So for any Sailor Moon fan, weither it be dub or sub, this is definetly for you. Heck, or for any bishoujo anime fan, you will immensley enjoy this.

Sailor Moon is the story of a young girl and her friends and lover who discover a long lost past, and civilization from which they were saved and sent to the future on Earth. Usagi Tsukino (SailorMoon)is found by her gaurdian cat Luna, who must ask her to transform into the super herione and to help her find the other Senshi (Soldier is its nearest meaning in english).Anyways they team up and must defeat a millinea old evil from repeating what happened to the Moon kingdom a thousand years ago..the senshi are the princess's sworn protectors and the princess of the Moon and the prince of Earth shared a forbidden love,will this ultimately save their world? Or cause both their death's like it did a thousand years ago?Are the star crossed lovers doomed to die?

But i was in 7th grade and i fell in love with sailor moon, but there were only two seasons!  Then came the two other seasons, s and Supers, the voices were horrible and ruined the show.
  Well, Last year i found the uncut bilingual version of those two seasons and remembered why i loved this show.  But the first two seasons were not uncut bilingual and almost ruined it again for me.  But now ADV is releasing the first two seasons uncut, subtitled and on DVD!  This release is making me so happy.  The dubbed version is all about her in middle school and how goofy the girls are, they are like the equivalent of the Valley Girls in California, Oh My God (shallow hair toss).  The uncut only means that they were targeting 14-18 year olds in Japan, not 7 y/o girls, like in America.
  The first season is about how this girl finds out that she is the protector of the moon kingdom, and has a court of sailor warriors to help defend her and help in her quest to save the world from evil forces.  They are Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, Sailor Venus, in order of appearance.  Sailor Moon has to find the colored crystals so she can get the Imperium Silver crystal.  She has to fight the forces of the negaverse, and at the end fights with their leader, Queen Beryl, for the right to hold the Crystal which ends with a heart-wrenching battle with the sailor scout's spirits with sailor Moon versus Beryl.

1878307,5,B000093NPZ,"Over ten years after the series aired in Japan; eight years since the dub was released, the first season of Sailor Moon is now available in the USA in uncut original form. Its been a long wait. My thanks to ADV for bringing us these DVDs.
Once upon a time in Tokyo, there was a middle school student named Usagi Tsukino. She was clumsy, didn't get the best grades, and her favorite things to do were play videogames and eat sweets. All in all, a very ordinary girl. But one day that simple life was changed forever; a cat named Luna appeared in her bedroom window and proclaimed that Usagi was a warrior who would save Earth from the evil powers of the Dark Kingdom. Like it or not, and she definately DIDN'T like it, Usagi was Sailor Moon, the defender of Love and Justice.
As she fights against the Dark Kingdom, Sailor Moon finds other girls who were destined to be Sailor Soldiers; encounters the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, who may or may not be her enemy; and discovers just how strong she really is. Love, friendship, the power of believing, these are the things that Usagi represents.
Sailor Moon is an excellent show for all ages. There are moments where you laugh out loud and moments that bring you to tears. The Japanese cast delivers a truely stirring performance, and the original music composed for the series only hightens one's enjoyment. Unlike the dub, nothing is ""dumbed down"" nor is the moral-of-the-day 'Sailor Says' section part of the Japanese show. As far as age goes, I think that kids 7+ should be able to watch these DVDs. Younger children might want parents handy for some sad scenes. Violent content is minimal with the exception of a few episodes, even then there isn't any gore; when the Sailors tranform they are shown as sparkly silouettes; and there are a few minor swear words. Overall, the uncut version of Sailor Moon is about a PG, which fits with its target age of girls 7-14.

This series about a group of super powered girls who fight for the ideals of justice against inhuman evil enemies must become the only thing that comes to mind when someone mentions the words 'Sailor Moon.'

1878310,5,B000093NPZ,"Welcome to what will certainly be a new dimension of the Sailor Moon series. For the American fans that have been exposed to the youth-friendly DiC cuts, ADV has taken the right step by introducing the first season the way it was meant to be seen. All episodes are uncut, taken off of the original Japanese masters, and fitted with English subtitles.
Many details will stand out between the American release and the unedited, original version. Perhaps this stands out the most in the final two episodes. Due to its graphic content, the final two episodes of the first season were condensed to a single episode for the American release. Here, however, you will be able to see how the Sailor Scouts' battle with Queen Beryl really ended, by seeing the final two episodes in their entirety.
Parents should be warned, however, that with the added scenes comes more suggestive dialogue and more violence, therefore this DVD box set is not recommended for young kids. (ADV's rating is Age 15+)
If I am not mistaken, ADV will also be coming out with the second season of Sailor Moon, uncut. If ADV proceeds with this release, it will be to delight of many Sailor Moon fans. That release will only leave us with the final season, Sailor Stars. There is much discussion about the more intense content in Stars, so while the release of Sailor Moon's final season in the American market is still up in the air (and may be for a long time), be sure to get your hands on the first season of Sailor Moon, uncut, which is worth the high price and is a must for anyone's Sailor Moon collection.",1053561600,55,1578,4.579505300353357

The only problem that I have is that there's one episode i believe in the second season where I have to skip. It's the one where Chibiusa is being attacked by the dark moon in her dreams. I have to skip the scene where she hold Puu, bc otherwise the dvd stops completely. I don't know if it's because of I got a faulty one or not.",1508889600,,480,3.9081632653061225

7989045,5,B000093NPZ,"If you are trying to get sailor moon season 1 then I would highly recommend getting the newer VIZ version. I personally own both & think the newer release is MILES beyond this one! The ADV release, while not horrible has VERY grainy/dirty looking picture & the audio is awful as well... I believe Toei sent ADV the original 1992 TV version of the show to transfer onto DVD rather than the newer remastered version Japan had (why? I don't know... But they did) so that's why the all around quality is not so great... The newer VIZ release, while not perfect has way clearer picture quality so you can really see what's going on & understand everything. They also re-subbed it & it is suppose to be a bit more accurate than the ADV version was but it also contains a new dub which has actually grown on me more than I though it would (sometimes I don't feel like reading subtitles & just want to relax & watch sailor moon lol) PLUS we finally get a more faithful/not chopped up version of sailor moon in English :D I honestly wasn't sure if this day would ever come or if the U.S. would even see sailor moon licensed again (I have been a fan since since late '95 when it first aired in the U.S.) and I'm beyond glad it's back & we will finally be getting ALL episodes/movies uncut & dubbed with all the same voice actors since there were so many changes on the original dub -_- Overall if you are a fan of sailor moon & are looking to get the 1st go with the new VIZ version TRUST ME! You will not regret it especially if you do a side by side comparison of the picture quality, plus you will be officially supporting sailor moon & showing Toei that we want it in the U.S. for good! You can get sailor moon season one part 1 & 2 of the new VIZ dub for the same price as this anyways (maybe even cheaper since its been out for a bit now & the price has definitely dropped since its release) But if you are a collector & just wanting to own some memorabilia then I would recommend this version but for watching purposes & actually enjoying the show in HD then like I previously said I definitely recommend the VIZ version! Sorry for the long review by the way lol.... >.<",1462924800,,2167,4.211538461538462
7989046,2,B000093NPZ,"If you were to watch Sailor Moon uncut in lowest quality and audio form you would have the adv sets. These were released years back before we even got uncut sailor moon. So this at the time was the best we could get. Now though it's pretty much useless. Ill go over the cons and pros with a 2015 view.

Pros:
The box cover has a really pretty design on it
Comes with slip covers for each dvd disc
Episodes aren't crammed in like 3 discs

Cons:
Quality issues aka poor picture and contrast
Only Japanese language track (unlike viz's new uncut English dub)
Messy subtitles
Bulky dvd cases
Hard to open cases
Audio issues on many episodes

Overall this is only good for collecting. If you want good dvds to watch sm on then get the new viz sets. The dvd ones are cheaper and better quality than these adv sets. Don't buy this if you aren't collecting. This is useless if you got the viz set.",1448668800,,888,4.273809523809524
