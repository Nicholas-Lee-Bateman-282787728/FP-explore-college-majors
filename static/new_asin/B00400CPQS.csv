4237503,5,B00400CPQS,I can relate to this story because I have loved with lupus for 13 years,1416355200,,71,3.8
4237504,5,B00400CPQS,"I first saw this movie on Netflix and I loved it. And I am sure that a lot of people can relate to it. When we first meet someone who we have a romantic interest in, we usually put up a front of being perfect. We hide our flaws and insecurities for fear that we will not be loved or accepted if we reveal our ugly warts. But if we drop the stainless steel facade, take the risk of opening up and showing those ugly parts of ourselves and love and accept each other despite our warts and all, it can be the beginning of true love and a wonderful relationship.",1390089600,,558,4.036036036036036
4237505,5,B00400CPQS,"A love story with a difference. When the odds are against you, never give up! I live with the autoimmune disease lupus, as a result life can take some unexpected twists and turns. Like Seta, I found that love doesn't have to be complicated. I cried at the end as I knew exactly how she felt. A must see ****** I hope this doesn't give too much away?",1292112000,2,349,4.147058823529412
4237506,4,B00400CPQS,"A little heavy for a rom-com but really great little movie about the true meaning of relationships and risks in ""putting it all out there.""  the two actors who played the leads ""Adam"" and ""Seta"" where  fantastic as well as the other supporting characters.  Also, being from MA I had heard of playwright Israel Horovitz but had never seen him act - he's great in this!  Again, don't expect something especially light-hearted, but if you want a movie that tackles some really serious issues with maturity of what it means to be in a relationship - I high recommend you check out.",1289001600,3,577,4.627450980392157
4237507,4,B00400CPQS,"The first 10 min was a little slow, but then after that, this was basically one of the best romantic-comedy, coming-of-age, urban fairytale (call it whatever you want!) films I have ever seen.  Yes, I don't think they had a lot of money, but the story - about a girl who hides the fact she has lupus and a guy who hides the fact that he lives at home taking care of his sick father and the lies they make up to avoid having to deal with what they are really dealing with - struck me as one of the most authentic films on the sacrifice of relationships I have ever seen.  Be warned, it is a somber movie... but thematically very powerful.",1289001600,3,637,4.170731707317073

4237513,1,B00400CPQS,Dull movie.  Bad storyline,1472774400,,26,5.5
4237514,3,B00400CPQS,characters were not very likable- extremely heavy drug usage throughout- which kind of drives the plot,1472774400,,102,5.4375
4237515,2,B00400CPQS,"Camera shaking, sound was off, lighting was pretty bad, looked like it was filmed with a cell phone in some parts. Very glad it was included in Prime and not an additional fee, but this is not a movie I can recommend unless you are looking for an interesting story to rewrite and produce professionally. I still can't get used to people just having sex after meeting a few times, it seems so empty and unfulfilling.  How can you possibly fall in love when you are just lying at each other?  Still, there was a little bit of sweetness to each of the characters, and a semi-happy ending. I liked how the subject of illness seemed pretty real, although not dealt with well. I could see this story or something like it done much, much better.  Words and Pictures, and Cake were done better, exploring relationships with chronic illness.",1472169600,2,832,4.570469798657718
4237516,4,B00400CPQS,"A surprisingly good human relations story.  No help for the chronic liars (nor for the chronic truth tellers promoting poisons and toxic relationships) on so-called ""social"" nor on ""dating"" web sites.  Nor any interference with the intentionally brief sexual relationships in places of worship of hetero religion which existed prior to the felony religionist shutdown with object rape con dumbs and illegal drugs circa 1986-87.  But for Big City residents capable at most of developing something real out of random chance meetings, it was very nice indeed.  A bit dark in the photography and production but the story itself and the acting of the players was of sufficient quality to justify a four star rating.",1471910400,,710,5.147826086956521
4237517,5,B00400CPQS,"Really enjoyable indie movie.  John Harlacher steals the show!  Cant' believe I haven't seen him in lots of other movies!  All the actors are good, but John the Man, you are great!",1471651200,,180,4.5625

8411468,3,B00400CPQS,I would love to know what the budget was to make this indie.  But it's not as bad as similar low budget films I've seen.  They did a decent job.,1503705600,,144,3.7666666666666666

8411474,4,B00400CPQS,"Sometimes...I like to watch movies about people that make choices that I wouldn't make. Maybe they're really well thought-out choices made with all good intentions, that totally backfire, or not. You just don't know! And to watch good people that get caught up in the trials & pitfalls of life and see how they muck it up, or rise above it all: THAT'S what I liked about this movie. It's a good movie, with depth and good actors. I will watch it again!",1474416000,,452,4.457831325301205
