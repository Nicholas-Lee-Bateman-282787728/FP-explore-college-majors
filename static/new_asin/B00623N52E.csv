4931684,5,B00623N52E,"First off I already own seasons 1-5 that I purchased on eBay, and I wholeheartedly give a 5 star rating for each season!  The main reason for this review is to give a heads up for potential buyers, because I'm seeing 2 different problems/complaints in these reviews.

First, if you are in North America, make sure the disc you are buying states ""NTSC (or Region 1)"".  If it says PAL (Region 2), you dvd player likely won't be able to play it (unless it's region free).  The covers will be different than the original Canadian releases, and will likely have a triangle or round rating on the front cover.

Second, if there's an orange bar across the top of the cover that states ""GMCTV/UP TV"" that is the US release, and is NOT the true ""complete season""-- as aired in Canada on CBC network!

Here's the deal with GMCTV/UPTV.  Because the US will always be behind in the way they can air seasons here (which is about a season and a half behind CBC, the Canadian network that airs it), these US TV release sets will likewise be the same way.

I made the mistake of buying ""the complete season 2 (GMCTV)"" release, only to find out it was Season 2 Episodes 10-18 to Season 3-Episodes 1-14.  So if you find ""Complete Season 3 (GMC TV/UP TV)"", would be the last 4 episodes of season 3, and probably up to episode 14 of season 4.

 I suggest that if you want the true seasons as aired in Canada, that you avoid any dvd package that has ""GMCTV/UP TV"" bar at the top.  You can refer to Amazon.ca and look at the listings to verify what the true cover looks like.  If you don't want to buy directly from there, check eBay!  (Or be doubly sure that the item on Amazon US states ""NTSC/Region 1"".)  That's what I ended up doing.  I actually bought season 1-5 as a package deal from a vendor there.  They may be lumping 1-6 together once it's released.  This year the dvd release is about a month later, being the season 7 premier is later (likely due to the flooding in the area back in June, which probably affected production time).  This Sunday Oct. 6th, is when the first episode of 7 airs (CBC network).  And the season 6 set will be released Oct. 15th.

One final note of caution is that the discs so far released are NOT high-def/blu-ray quality.  There is graininess to the picture, especially seen in low light scenes.

For the most up to date information on the series, go to:  cbc.ca/heartland/ , or the official FB page:  facebook.com/cbcheartland

Anyway, hope this helps everyone!",1380585600,56,2481,4.433628318584071
4931685,5,B00623N52E,"Heartland is a wonderful series about a family that lives on a ranch in Canada. The family has its ups and downs but their love for each other and the horses they care for is remarkable. The title sums it up. They really do have a heart for their family, home and the horses and animals they work with and care for. The scenery is breathtaking! The characters are great! Each one does a tremendous job portraying their role and the Grandfather, Jack, is super as he adds real heart and humor to the show. It's a story you can relate to and each episode keeps you wanting more. I recommend this series for families. Be sure to start at the beginning as the story unfolds with each episode.",1376092800,6,688,4.341085271317829

4931733,5,B00623N52E,"HEARTLAND is apparently Canada's premier TV drama. I can see why...there is just the right combination of action, drama, romance and comedy to make it enjoyable for everyone watching. Above all else, the story of the young horse whisperer is almost mystical and Grandfather Jack is a somewhat crusty individual who is the one everyone else turns to for advice and help in times of trouble. (As a Grandfather, I can certainly relate to this.)

4931935,5,B00623N52E,"So much happens in Season Three, Lou's relationship speeds ahead with Peter, Megan Follows gives a wonderful performance as Ty's mother, and Amy meets someone who sparks her attention. There are other episodes that build and solidify the story line in the Fleming household and you shake your head after each episode and wonder if Heartland can get any better and it does. If you have come this far you're probably hooked and may be wondering if you should continue with the rest of the seasons.  As mentioned before the CBC has announced  Heartland will continue and is starting it's 10th year. The program has an international following which is kind of interesting because most of its viewers have to wait for the DVD to come out to catch up. I really like Season 3, Season 4 is even better.

Something worth mentioning about Season 3, if you decide to continue to watch the program...there is a 2 hour Christmas special that is not included in the Heartland Season 3 package, that is very important to the story line in what happens in the future to Ty and Amy's relationship, the title is 'A Heartland Christmas'.  The special was on UPTV several years ago, and when I looked for it on Amazon to purchase that is when I found out Heartland was a series.",1464480000,2,1258,4.602678571428571

I was just checking cbc.ca/heartland about episodes per season after watching the extras after season 3 which was great and they talked about it like saying stuff when season 4 ended. Apparently season 3 of the orange top boxes is really season 4 of the red top box. So as I finished season 3 if I had bought 4 with a red top it would be the same. STICK WITH WHATEVER COLOR TOP YOU START WITH EITHER ORANGE OR RED.,1458518400,,495,4.221052631578948

4931955,5,B00623N52E,I Love this show so much. I wish amazon had the newer season on here where i can buy them to stream online but they don't They only have the first three seasons with that option so hopefully the other seasons are avaiable that way in the future. So i really love this show it is a great show all the way around and it would be great for any family. I remember finding this show on netflix back in 2013. I started it and never looked back and thanks to this show i made it though that winter that year. We were having weeks of 40 below degree F weather that year it was probably the coldest winter i ever saw. If it wasn't for this show and how happy it made me feel i do not think i would have made it threw that winter. Ok maybe i would have but this just made things a little easier and made me forget how bad the cold weather really was. I really would recommend this show if you have never seen it. I hope i could convince someone else to give this show a chance. Oh by the way it is based out of Canada and i wish i could live where they film this because they land and stuff is so pretty.,1455926400,,1094,3.888392857142857

There are more episodes on these than on the original Canadian version and they are cheaper.  I have also noticed that they skip what few foul words that were originally aired.  Some might think that it is a bad copy but to be honest, I like it.  This is something that we as a family have been sitting around and watching every night.  My whole family loves Heartland!  I can't say enough good things about it.  Season 3 consists of episodes 46-67.",1425427200,,612,4.401785714285714

Now that being said, I did have a DVD issue which I think I've figured out. I hope I can explain it. I purchased Season 1 & 2 of the UP version, then dummy me ordered Season 3 in the English/French version and flipped out because the episodes weren't matching up. Actually the English/French version matches what I'm watching on the UP channel. I have since ordered the Season 3 & 4 in the UP version, to keep in line with what I'm watching. My suggestion is stick to one version and you shouldn't have a problem. Pay attention to the version you order. Don't do like I did. But it's all worth the money. Love these people and love the stories. It's great for the whole family.",1415750400,5,808,4.287581699346405

4932013,2,B00623N52E,"I gave this a 2 star, not because of its quality, but because it is NOT what it says it is .  This NOT Season 3 of ""Heartland.""  There are ONLY four episodes of ""Season 3"" on this disk and they are episodes 14 - 18 of ""Season 3.""  Where are episodes 1 - 13?  They are missing on this disk!  If you want ""Season 3"" you should NOT buy this disk.  What is on this disk is episodes 14 - 18 of ""Season 3"" and episodes 1 - 18 of Season 4, plus the ""Special Features"" of Season 4.  When you buy this disk, you will get ALL of Season 4 but you will NOT get the first 13 episodes of Season 3.  It is quite a jump from seeing Season 2 and then putting in what is suppose to be Season 3 and find yourself at episode 14.  A lot of events come between the end of Season 2 and the 14th episode of Season 4 and as a viewer I was confused and wondered how we could go from Season 2 and get to what was being shown as the beginning of Season 3.  Then later I found out that it was not me who had slipped in following the journey of this wonderful series; it was this disk which is NOT what it says it is.  Amazon should NOT be selling this disk!  If you want Season 3 you need to NOT buy this disk which has ""As Seen On UP/Uplifting Entertainment"" across the top.  Buy the disk which has ""The Complete Third Season - Saison 3"" across the top.",1413504000,,1325,3.791970802919708

Do NOT mix-n-match the first 4 Seasons [Canada's CBC ""Season 1"" only had 13 episodes]. The episodes are identified in really, really small print on each set (back, bottom, last sentence); so there's no need to open the cellophane.

If you have ""Seasons 1-3"" on the gmc or UP, DVD sets, skip ""Season 4"" and go to ""Season 5"" (beginning w/episode 68).

I would totally recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a decent family oriented programs.  I own all 6 seasons and have not been disappointed yet.

However, everyone who wishes to purchase any of these seasons, should know that season 3 and 4 are identical.  This is a Canadian production and I think the American version combined season 4 into season 3 as a 5 disc set.
