376648,5,6301920376,"If you enjoy Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and making fun of cheesy old movies with friends this one is perfect for you.  Not a good or complete movie by anyone's standards, this is a delightful story of a pediophile rapist who we never learn the identity of because he is always in his car.  Note: this isn't an evil car movie, there is somebody driving the car, we just never learn who it is.  (I think it's the gymnastics coach).  Anyway it's worth buying for the hilarious and infamous cop flying boot shot.",1141171200,2,510,4.451612903225806
376649,5,6301920376,This is sucha great killer car movie I saw it as a kid and have loved it ever since. I would love to see it out on DVD but that's unlikely anyway there are only 2 killer car movies better The Car(natch) and the very obscure Death Car On The Freeway which has been out of print for years anyway I think most people would like this movie I got a friend to watch it and he hates B movies he loved this one and bought his own copy so give it a shot,1081468800,10,444,3.734042553191489
376650,1,6301920376,"In all seriousness, this is one of the worst things I have ever made myself watch. Beware of this movie at all costs. It will suck you in much like the facination with a car or train wreck can. This has some of the worst acting, bad writing, and ridiculous effects I have ever seen. If you and your friends have a ""bad movie night"", then this is for you...",1060560000,3,356,4.1
376651,5,6301920376,"Out of all the killer car films ever made this is the first to have a genuinely creepy looking car as the antagonist. As a child this was one of my favorite films. Perhaps that's why I still love this film despite reading countless reviews dismissing it as trash. My parents had a trailer in Michigan and they would take me to this strange little laundromat/video store near the camping grounds that had this film. I checked the title out every weekend I was up there and was dissappointed to find that my local video stores back home didn't have a copy. About two years ago, after searching countless pre-viewed racks and coming up with nothing, I shelled out the $70 dollars and bought it online. I reccomend purchasing a copy now if you want one because any copies in stock anywhere are likely to be limited.",1041465600,10,811,4.523809523809524
376652,5,6301920376,"I love this movie it is about a black dodge charger with one beast of an engine that terrorizes a small mining town in nevada called copper valley. I agree with what most people say that this movie is best when watched in  the middle of the night, the plot is not very clear basicly just some psyco  in a car who kidnaps and rapes even kills some of the towns adolecent  girls. you never do find out who the driver of the car is which I think is  better because it sort of makes you wonder if there really is a driver. The  car itself looks almost evil its front grill with the dual headlights kind  of makes it look like evil eyes staring you down I LOVE IT if I could find  a car like it I would buy it in an instant.so buy it you will not regret it  you have my word ;-)",961891200,12,773,3.878980891719745

7816548,4,6301920376,"If anyone is interested: The opening shots (about the first 8 minutes) of the 74 Charger was filmed in Tucson, AZ on Soldier Trail between Ft. Lowell Road and Calle De Samuel Drive. I drove to work each day on Soldier Trail, one day on the way home found a bunch of trailers and film trucks parked on the side of the road - this was probably late 1989. I pulled off and asked what they were filming. One of the camera guys told me about the movie ""Wheels Of Terror"" they were filming for cable TV. Pretty sure there were two of these 74 chargers there at the time. Really cool to see the beater Charger up close! Possible that they shot some other footage of the Charger on Wentworth Road as well. Anyone who knows the area will recognize Soldier Trail and the Catalina mountain range in the background.

A couple of tweaks in the script it could have been a solid entry into the killer car genre - Duel, Christine, Wraith, The Car (which they pretty much ripped off for this movie).  Some good thrills and chills, but the unseen psycho creep in the menacing Charger gets the starring role over the rest of the cast and script. If you like Wheels Of Terror, be sure to see THE CAR (1977) with James Brolin, Ronny Cox, and Satan. It doesn't have the scrumptious Joanna Cassidy in the cast, but it's a badass killer car movie all the same.

P.S. There were dozens and dozens of these VHS copies in every Dollar Tree store for $1.99 about 10 years back. Don't fret - Pretty easy to find this movie on dvdr with artwork on the internet nowadays for $10 - $15 bucks. Over and Out......",1485907200,3,1580,4.313131313131313
7816549,2,6301920376,The movie is not as good as The Car starring James Brolin I cant believe the asking price for this movie But most made for T.V movies or movies out of print are going to be expensive the actors in this film are not very Believable and I have always been annoyed by Joanna Cassidy and her Laugh cant really get past that in her films .,1454889600,,334,4.0

7816551,5,6301920376,Wheels of terror is one of my favorite killer car movies it's up there with the car and Christine and maximum overdrive it i first saw it on usa and then i rented it back in the 90's because it's that good because it has one of the best chase scenes at the end. so if you like killer car movies then this is for you,1396483200,4,315,3.787878787878788
7816552,4,6301920376,"Through the '90s, usa network did some good movies, their tv shows that I've seen have been good too. I liked this one. It kinda reminded me of The Car and to a lesser extent, Christine, this one works on its own merits though. I saw rushes for this when usa made it, looked creepy, but good...overall, I wasn't disappointed. I expected a more supernatural tone,  but no big deal. Nowadays, no network is entirely original, most of the modern shows have lost a great deal of their old fashioned creativity. The premium channels on the other hand, well that depends on how creative your willing to get.",1394496000,4,601,4.564814814814815
7816553,5,6301920376,"I saw this movie when it first aired back in 1990 when i was 14, on the USA network and it really scared me as a kid, i think it still holds up today as a great scary car movie, love the music also.",1388966400,3,198,3.522727272727273
7816554,5,6301920376,it was a great movie ...it was suspensful great characters it was a wondeful video highly recommended ....wonderfu just wonderful ....,1378425600,2,134,5.428571428571429
7816555,3,6301920376,I grew up in the town that this was filmed in and remember them filming so I am a little biased. This is a great movie if you love campy horror. I just can't believe that it is so expensive considering that USA network aired it just about every week as filler.,1368662400,2,260,4.019230769230769
7816556,5,6301920376,This is not my taste in movies but for some reason this is one of my nieces favorite movies.  She loves this movie.  It would give me nightmares but if you like scary suspensful and frightening movies you will love this one.,1230336000,7,224,4.309523809523809
