2987935,4,B000WOSAUQ,"Since I have only viewed and practiced the segments once this is my initial response.  I certainly was pleased by the challenge and the flow of the poses.  My only objection is the lack of instruction on breathing.  She didn't cue as much as I would have enjoyed.  Yet, overall, this is a keeper for my fitness regime.

If anyone is interested in an all level yoga workout DVD/VHS, it would be Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga with Sarah Ivanhoe who gives excellent breathing instruction as well as prompts for poses.",1201219200,,554,4.555555555555555
2987936,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I love Denise Austin's routines. She is so upbeat and her workouts are fun! You should have some knowledge of yoga beforehand as this really is NOT an instructional DVD. Denise packs a lot of great yoga postures into a short amount of time, yet she holds the poses for a good amount of time and really doesn't seem rushed.

A reviewer said she does not cue well, but I think it's just fine: you should have some knowledge of yoga already and know about the positioning of your body in specific poses. Once you get used to the routine it is really easy to follow and quite fun!

You get 4 routines on the DVD and it's great because with the menus you can mix and match in any order you like. The first one is the longest and called Total Yoga Toning. It includes standing postures, most vinyasa style (lots of flow and movement). I especially like the next three: Legs, Abs, and Stretch; each one is approx. 10 minutes for a great quick 30 min yoga session. Some of the postures can be a bit of a challenge; this is much more traditional than I've seen from Denise in previous DVDs. The set is beautiful, bright orange blue water fall in the background.

This is not hard core yoga, but a lovely easy practice that will definitely brighten and start your day right. If you like Denise's other DVD, you will like this one. (If you don't like her voice, upbeat attitude, cueing, etc., you will probably not like this one either.) You can mute her voice and just have music, although I don't see the benefit of this option since you would have to constantly look up to follow along. (A choice of no music would be nice then I could add my own, but that option is not available on this DVD.)

Please check my other reviews on Amazon for other great yoga practices, Namaste'",1200787200,57,1768,4.348484848484849
2987937,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This was my first yoga DVD that I've bought, and I really like it. The Yoga Burn segment was extremely challenging the first time I did it, and I could feel the burn! I love the relax segment - it definitely quiets my body. Denise's voice has never bothered me in any of her videos, but I can see how it would annoy some people. In this video, you can mute her voice and just listen to the music if you're one of those people. For me, this DVD was a great first experience with yoga.",1200528000,,483,4.041666666666667
2987938,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Thia video is a bit challenging, but I absolutely love it and it makes me feel great! I am not advanced in yoga, but I was able to get a hang of the sequences. Denise does move fast in this one, so I would not reccommend it for beginners (it will only discourage you). Her voice in the instruction is very annoying, but if you are looking for a great workout, you'll get past that.",1200009600,,381,4.093333333333334
2987939,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Denise has created a great video.  The option to just have the music playing without instruction is great.  I know some people hate Denise's instruction but I find it very helpful since I workout with her videos several times a week and don't need detailed cueing with each viewing.  The Yoga Relax segment does just as the title says, you leave feeling relaxed.  I recommend this video to anyone!",1199923200,,397,4.7101449275362315
2987940,1,B000WOSAUQ,"Strongly agree & beautifully stated by reviewer Bowers.  Denise Austin's cues were completely out of sequence and at times I didn't know what was going on or what to do next.  I was wondering does she think I have eyes like a spider that I can see the TV while facing down on the floor mat.  She also doesn't give you sufficent time to get into the yoga poses.  Moves to quickly to enjoy yoga.  I was extremely upset and ready to ditch the DVD.  I thought yoga is suppose to be calming but not with Denise Austin.  Oh and lets not forget her voice - annoying.  I just started Yoga a year ago and watch Steve Ross on Oxygen at 6:00 am, and also brought Ellen Barrett super slimdown crunch: Pilates Yoga Blend and I can say now they know how to cue.  I had purchased a Denise Austin video years ago and it was the same issue - her cueing, out of sequence or never called out.  I was hoping she had taken the time to read her viewer comments and made some changes to her workouts.  Guess not.",1199836800,2,989,4.12565445026178
2987941,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I stumbled upon this DVD at Walmart for $10, so being a big fan of Denise's workouts I had to get it!  Looks like I got a pretty good deal too.  I was hoping this one would be a good challenge and it is!  I have only done the ""Yoga burn"" segment, but that was enough for today.  I used to go to a yoga class down the street, but with my schedule it has become tough.  This workout reminds me a lot of my yoga class(which i was really wanting to fit into my schedule) that made me feel so good!  You do moves such as cobra, downward dog, upward dog, balancing stick, soaring eagle, chair and more(I can't remember all the names).  What is really challenging about this is doing all the moves in a quick sequence for the ""yoga burn"".  So if you are familiar with most yoga positions, you should be ok doing this workout, but like me, you may have a challenge in doing the sequences!!  Practice makes perfect, so enjoy the challenge!",1199664000,5,930,4.179775280898877
2987942,2,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a slightly more advanced workout than we usually get from Denise.  I was surprised to see her do The Crow, for instance.  However, I have to give her low marks for her cueing on this workout.  This is a pet peeve of many who exercise with her, but I usually don't mind her cheery babble.  This one's pretty bad that way, though.  As she does so infuriatingly on her TV shows, she puts you in a position where you can't see the TV, then says something like ""Put your hands right here.""  Right where?  While I'm doing a free workout on Lifetime, I don't mind.  When I've bought a DVD which should have had more planning (perhaps a script?), I expect more.  While I liked the workout, I found myself getting mad by the time she put me in Corpse Pose and told me to clear my mind.

If you've never done yoga before, don't start here -- it moves too fast (at an aerobic pace), and Denise will have you thoroughly confused.  (Beginners -- try the excellent Yoga Zone DVDs.)  You'd never know it by this review, but I'm actually a fan of Denise's.  Her recent Hit The Spot Pilates is one of my all-time favorites.  I'm just disappointed that after all her years as a fitness instructor, she's still so bad at cueing.",1199145600,53,1217,4.3039647577092515
2987943,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Here is the synopsis from Denise:  In Yoga Body Burn, Denise Austin guides you through a dynamic vinyasa of workouts designed to burn fat, sculpt lean legs, flatten the tummy, and rejuvenate the body. Whether combined or performed individually, these yoga workouts will incinerate fat and improve your body's overall tone and flexibility in no time. The DVD features YOGA BURN, which ignites the body's internal furnace with aerobic-paced yoga moves that burn calories for an incredible fat meltdown; YOGA LEGS, which sculpts leaner, longer legs with dynamic yoga poses that challenge balance, flexibility, and strength; YOGA ABS, which strengthens and shrinks your midsection using core-focused yoga moves to define a trimmer, tighter tummy; and YOGA RELAX, in which you quiet your mind with a series of gentle yoga stretches that rejuvenate and refresh the body.",1198368000,11,864,5.352941176470588
2987964,1,B000WOSAUQ,I don't have much yoga experience and found most of these exercises impossible and dangerous for me to do.  I don't think this video is meant for the average person looking to get in shape.,1485043200,,189,4.4
2987965,4,B000WOSAUQ,Good workout from one of the best fitness instructors!  She gives good directions and is not overly chatty but if you prefer you can do the workout w/o the audio.,1484697600,,162,4.4

2987967,4,B000WOSAUQ,"The 20 minute yoga burn is a strong aerobic workout like all good power vinyasa.  Especially the upper body with all those chatarangas! This section really keeps me in shape. Standing pose section can be done with light weights to add challenge. One Caution:  Denise goes through the chair pose prayer twists too rapidly for beginners and/or if you have a bad/sensitive back.
The 10 minute legs is excellent and powerful.
 10 minute yoga abs Killer eagle crunches and prayer twist crunches really works hard the tough to reach lower belly--however a Caution here: you may get a sore neck if you are a beginner, have a bad neck and or weak neck.  I recommend  support with a neck roll or small pilates ball to lay the back of your head down on.  I'm an intermediate and I use one hand to support my head in all of the crunches in this segment at least part of the time.",1481155200,10,868,4.427672955974843

2987972,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I was already fairly familiar with this one, as I had seen the online version. I ordered the DVD because I was tired of internet lag. (Always seems to happen in the middle of difficult positions!)
I like the fact that Denise Austin encourages you during the entire workout. Love the fact that she emphasizes that yoga is about what YOU can do.
I LOVE the fact that the workouts are customizable. Feeling ambitious? Add one of the 10 minute workouts to the original 20 minute workout.
The original workout is what I call a ""Goldilocks Workout"" Not too short, not too long, just right. All in all, I'd say this was a good workout for people with a little yoga experience already under their belts.",1470787200,,695,4.523809523809524

This is not for the beginner though, learn the basic yoga moves before moving on to these routines.  She flows at a very nice pace and believe me, you will break a sweat.  I completed all four workouts one after the other, and felt great after.  The relax/cool down is just enough.  Each routine is not too long, but enough to get a great workout in.  I purchased this to change up my routines during the week, and now I can complete more yoga workouts.  I workout hard, aerobically, weight training, yoga and walking, and wanted to add more stretch to my weekly activity, and this dvd surely does just that.  Those who enjoy yoga, will benefit from this workout.",1460073600,3,777,4.532374100719425

I however, find Denise Austin's voice annoying.  Nothing against her, I just can't stand the way she talks.  There is an option to play with just music and not her voice, so that is nice.  I guess once I have learned the routine better, I might have to do it that way.  The exercises are great though.",1434326400,,464,4.157303370786517

2988007,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I didn't get this one. Seems like when you try to fuse two completely separate things (relaxing yoga and intense fat burning exercising) you tend to lose out on both accounts; you don't get yoga's soothing stretching and relaxation and you don't get any sort of fat burning, muscle building exercises since she doesn't do enough reps of each and for not enough time. I mean, how much leg building can you do in 10 minutes, especially when you only do 2-3 reps of each? I didn't get much of a workout with this tape. No cueing, no instruction, and her voice did not go well with the wanna-be relaxing yoga-ish style of this DVD. Even the ladies in the background looked confused at times.  If you want to burn calories, get a fast moving aerobic DVD, if you want yoga, get a yoga tape, but don't try to mesh these two completely different things together, it doesn't work. Lesson learned!",1424304000,2,887,4.509316770186335
2988008,2,B000WOSAUQ,I got a good work out--but I am a person who workes out and runs but I am no expert on yoga. I found the instructions lacking and there were not a lot of shown alternatives for folks new to yoga.,1424217600,,195,3.7804878048780486
2988009,4,B000WOSAUQ,"I have not done the leg workout - I run quite a bit and my legs don't need the additional work, they are sore as is.
I have done the other two and liked them. Perfect for cross-training. Yes, I agree that she is not great with cues and moves a bit fast. You should know a thing or two about yoga, be in at least somewhat decent shape, and do this video several times to learn the flow. Given all that, it's a great video for your rotations. I interchange it with Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper yoga videos.",1422316800,,507,4.08

I'm a beginner, so the moves were challenging enough to feel like I had a good work out, and I felt strong and powerful during and after. She isn't the best instructor...swaps moves without explaining and not much talk about breathing, but I really love the poses and speed.

2988030,3,B000WOSAUQ,"Denise Austin is cheesy and a touch grating to me...HOWEVER, I really like the workout.  I started with an interest in yoga for spiritual/relaxation purposes, and eventually tried to add some of the cardio interpretations.  This one isn't too bad, though I hated the throw-in lines like ""Feel the awareness!""

I like that I get a chance to do several different yoga moves (instead of doing only 2 or 3 moves for the entire workout), and I like how she moves quick to ""generate heat."" You can do one full workout or 3 individual workouts with a bonus relaxation workout. The main workout is 20 minutes and the others are 10 minutes each. I enjoyed doing the main workout on youtube and decided to purchase the DVD. I don' t think this is for beginners, but if you like yoga and have some experience and want something other than the typical yoga workout, go for it.

You don't hold the poses at all and are moving so quickly from pose to pose that I literally could not keep up or figure out what the heck she was doing half the time.  There was no emphasis on breath, this was not restorative whatsoever because she is talking the whole time and because the pace is so ridiculously fast.  I felt like this was more of a traditional workout video that uses yoga poses, NOT a yoga practice.  I threw this in the giveaway pile immediately after using it was that bad.

2988067,4,B000WOSAUQ,"Really nice video. It has a 3 20-min sections: one cardio, one abs and one legs; and one 10 min section of stretching. It has a cool feature that allows you to select which sections you want and plays it consecutively, so you don't have to stop and select the next session to start in the middle of your work out. I also like that you can chose to play it with music only, or with the spoken instructions.  At first I though Denise sounded a little to perky and obnoxious, but it works well in the work out.  I'm young, but not into exercise, and half way through the cardio section and I was out of breath. I thought I did enough work for legs in the cardio and and haven't felt the need to do the legs section yet.
The only thing is that it is a bit fast for yoga, not very true to yoga tradition, in my opinion. So it's more of a workout than a yoga video.

I do it every day! 10 minutes per option and just enough to get you going. However make sure you have a remote! It won't work on one tv because all we can do is push play, but on the other it works, ( to pick your combo you have to move it down and to the side and stuff to pick options)",1366588800,,459,3.7916666666666665

It's fast if you're a novice, but you won't get bored with it once you've done it 20 times, which is important to me. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this video.",1364083200,,376,4.236111111111111
2988070,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I totally disagree with those that say her cues are not good. She is as good as ever and the workout is great. For those complaining about her not shutting up, there is an option to play the workout without her voice over.",1363132800,,222,4.186046511627907
2988071,2,B000WOSAUQ,So the concept of the work out is a good one However since she was going so fast i could not keep up sometimes. Also the speed actually made me sick I got Vertigo from doing this work out. Almost wish i would had bought it here it would had been less of a waste of my money.,1362787200,,274,3.7413793103448274

I have bad knees and my wrists hurt during Yoga, but this Isn't too much wrist use. I LOVE that she challenges you with the Crow. I have about a 20 minute attention span so this is great, I'm able to add the abs and legs due to it being separate, and i love the menu option.

2988078,4,B000WOSAUQ,"I did this video a long time ago when I was younger. I'm talking like 14.  That was about 10 years ago. I liked it the, but I know I wasn't doing a lot of the poses correctly.  I then found this DVD again my sophomore or junior year of college. I didn't like it so much because I had taken a yoga class and I actually cared about what the poses felt like and I wasn't sure about what I was doing on my own.  That was the only time I did it.  I've been practicing yoga more seriously for about 2 years now so I know what the poses are supposed to feel like and look like.  I agree with people who say that this is for more intermediate practitioners who what things are supposed to feel like. I didn't mind doing it today.  I also think that the sequence where she goes from side angle to reverse warrior should be a little bit slower. Not by much, but just slow enough so you can take a better breath.  Other than those things, I felt fine doing it.  Like I said earlier, I don't feel like this is much of a beginner video...she doesn't exactly explain the poses, which can cause injury.",1334188800,,1087,4.046728971962617

So when I bought this one I was very excited to see how she was going to be with her yoga exercises.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in that her instruction on each move is very fast, too fast for a yoga routine in my opinion, having taking yoga classes in the past.  Because I have to look up at the TV screen, I miss some of the routine because she moves on too fast.  If she would slow down for each move and give you more time, it would be perfect.",1332288000,,582,3.948717948717949
2988080,5,B000WOSAUQ,I like that there are 3 sections in the DVD so you can do as little or as much as you want.  It's easy to follow and she gives good directions so you know how to do each move.,1315699200,,175,3.4871794871794872
2988081,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This has many moves and you definitely feel them.  I was really surpised at the workout, all the balancing moves can be challenging. Plus, Denise is great in this dvd.  Usually she's goofy, but she is really in her element with this one.
Some other yoga dvds are slow and boring.  This one is not, yet you hold the poses a decent amount of time.",1313971200,3,345,4.276923076923077
2988082,1,B000WOSAUQ,I have used several DVDs and this is the WORST by far. There is no emphasis on the breath. No holding of poses. Even with a good vinyasa flow weight loss workout there is mindfulness of the breath and not just moving around as fast as you possibly can. Will not use again.,1308182400,,272,4.150943396226415
2988083,4,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a great workout. I am a big fan of Denise Austin. The only complaint I have is that her instructions could be better. She says things like ""place your hands here"" when you are not able to see the video to know where ""here"" is. The routine goes very quickly, and I sometimes feel rushed moving from one position to the next. I have done the workout only a few times and it seems to get easier to transition between moves each time I do the workout. My advice would be try not to get discouraged until you have done the workout a few times.",1307491200,2,546,4.11214953271028

2988085,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a great DVD!

As other reviewers have said there are 4 sections.  My favorite is the fat-burning yoga or 1st section.  It includes poses like warrior 2, chair, triangle, warrior 3, pose of the dancer, balancing stick, vinyasa flows, twists, splits, downward dog, eagle, and even a squat and crow.  I definitely think it is a good workout.  It is 20 minutes almost exactly.

The next 3 sections are legs, abs, and relaxation.  Each is 10 minutes.  The leg section is fun but was not particularly challenging for me except a move at the end where you stand on your side on one leg with one hand down and lift the other leg in the air.  The ab section is not very challenging either but I enjoyed it.  The relaxation session I believe does offer relaxation.

The 1st 2 sections are done with Denise and 2 other female participants and the last 2 are Denise by herself.  All of the verbal instructions are live and not voiceover which I really like.  The music is non-annoying.  I definitely recommend this DVD!",1298419200,5,1015,4.5054945054945055

I had read good things about Body Burn so I thought I'd give it a go.  I honestly like Yoga Buns better, but I also enjoyed Body Burn.  I like how it's split into sections- a 20 minute section on burning and all different poses, 10 minutes on legs, 10 minutes on abs, and 10 minutes on relaxation stretches.  Some of the poses in this DVD are the same as in Yoga Buns, but I feel like this DVD is more fast paced with less instruction, which is fine for me, but for a beginner it might be hard.  I think Denise is more peppy in Yoga Buns.  If you like Yoga and are looking to mix up your routine, I would recommend this DVD!",1298160000,9,733,3.918918918918919

It is challenging enough to make you feel good that you accomplished something and it is not so difficult that you don't wanna turn on the TV again.  I had more energy and felt more alert in just a couple of days than I had in a really long long time!  Totally recommend it to at least get started for those of you who want to do something but don't have much time; just set aside 20 mins a day and you're done!,1282694400,,503,3.8173076923076925

I think the 50 minute length (20 min. power yoga, 10 min. legs focus, 10 min. abs focus, 10 min. cool-down stretching) is good, and I like how certain segments focus on the legs and abs. This would be difficult for someone who is not already familiar with yoga poses, as Denise moves very quickly through the sun salutations.

Her wonderful voice is so encouraging and supportive that after doing this DVD for a month I rarely look up - I just follow her instructions. It leaves me so relaxed - stress free and energized. I am doing it sometimes with my 7 year old girl and it is a great bonding experience for us. It is my absolutely favorite work out. I do not even want to go to the gym after i have it. I am getting ready to my third pregnancy doing it every day and I feel a great difference even after a month. I am looking to get her pregnancy DVD next. It is also such a great stress reliever.

2988105,4,B000WOSAUQ,"I just recently started including yoga in my exercise routine.  I have Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and was looking for a yoga DVD that would provide certain levels of exercise and difficulty for me.  I'm 42 years old and at a healthy weight.  I don't have any disability yet.

The only other yoga DVD I've tried and enjoyed was from the P90X series.  P90X is a much longer workout, and it holds the poses longer than this one.  P90X is great, but it wasn't always convenient for my schedule or what I could do that day.

I admit, the first time I did Yoga Burn I was frustrated, because Denise held some of the poses for only a few seconds, and she did seem hard to follow.  However, each time I did the workout after that, I found that I was becoming more and more familiar with the routine and following along became much easier.

I like that I can customize the four workouts, selecting them according to my schedule and energy level for that day.  For a few of the more difficult poses, I can use a chair for balance if needed.  Some days I just need a good stretch, so I can take 10 minutes and simply do workout #4 anytime!",1273017600,3,1125,4.259433962264151

Yes, she's not good at giving vocal instructions and she is guilty of holding a pose for different lengths of time on each side (my biggest pet peave). However, I'm still very happy with the dvd.  I can just look up to make sure I'm doing it right- next time I'll just know.  I've also counted out her holds a few times so that I know I'm doing things evenly. I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bath water. I do  mix of workouts and this one is any where from once a week to 3-4 times! I say its a buy.",1269993600,2,724,4.034965034965035
2988108,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I just did this DVD this morning and I know it will be one of the DVD's I keep coming back to.  What I love about this DVD and other Denise Austin yoga DVD's (Fat Blasting yoga, Power Yoga Plus) is that her yoga is DYNAMIC...meaning moving instead of just holding a pose for a long time.  I know many do not enjoy this way of doing yoga and they feel that Denise moves too fast. They would rather have the traditional type of yoga that is more meditative and holding poses longer. That is understandable and that kind of yoga is wonderful, too...but on most days when I want to feel energized (in the mornings) and get a good yoga workout in quick, and in a very fun way, I choose Denise Austin's yoga DVD's. The more meditative, restorative, holding the postures for longer I do in the evenings when I have more time and want to relax.

There is a lot of value in this DVD. There is the basic body burn (20 minutes), yoga abs (10), yoga legs (10) and yoga relax (10).  Today I did just the body burn and yoga abs and I felt I got a great workout and was ready to face the day.  I really appreciate how I only needed 30 minutes to feel great.  I also like how I can do any segments I want and get a nice, quick, refreshing work out in.  All the segments are interesting and fun.  I believe in all of them there were new ways of moving I have never done before. I love that.

If you like dynamic vinyasa...flowing fun yoga...then this DVD should not disapoint.",1268870400,4,1459,4.1453900709219855
2988109,4,B000WOSAUQ,"This was my first Yoga DVD.  I had never done Yoga before buying this DVD and now I am hooked on Yoga.  The workout is intense but easy on your joints.  Most of the Yoga poses were easy, but they definately worked your muscles.  Every time I do this DVD I feel great.  There are days when I don't have a lot of time and I just do the Yoga Body burn workout which is about 20 minutes long and after doing it I feel like I have spent an hour at the gym.",1267574400,,451,3.75531914893617

2988111,4,B000WOSAUQ,"You should def have a little more knowledge on Yoga before trying this video. Other than that I thought it was great, the first time I tried it, it was a little difficult trying to see her doing the moves and doing them myself  at the same time since she moves quickly but thats why you have a pause and rewind button. Def got easier getting the right motions the second time around. I really like how upbeat she was,  I really enjoyed the moves def try it out !!!!",1262563200,,465,4.155555555555556
2988112,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I had never done yoga or pilates before this video; I had never used any workout DVD for that matter. But when I developed neuromas in both feet (painful nerve bundles), I could no longer do the exercises I have always done before (no running, elliptical, etc.), so I picked up this video in my search to find something low impact that WORKS, as I can't really supplement my workout with a quick jog. Boy am I glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised with the effects of yoga. It is refreshing, keeps me interested, and easy to do. And yes, it is a workout. The more I do the video, the more I am able to strengthen the poses by really flexing the muscles and adding some ankle / wrist weights. Plus the video contains 4 workouts that you can mix and match, so you can start with one and build up to do all 4 (though the 4th is more stretching/relaxation than a workout) for a longer workout. I have even done the 20 minute ""body burn"" workout twice back to back for an extended workout.

I hate to workout. (Who doesn't!?) But I actually found the video to be a great combination of an interesting workout (that I can feel) and some much needed de-stressing stretches and poses. The background music is gentle but upbeat and the set is nicely done. I have read a lot of other reviews that criticize Denise's cue-ing, and though I had never thought of this before, as the video never bothered me, I can see how it would annoy some. However, I have tried other beginner Yoga DVD's after being impressed with this one, and was more annoyed by other instructors' dry and flat instruction, as well as the general slowness of their routines. I guess I like a little more upbeat and a little faster pace. If you're bored with other yoga DVD's, this might be the right one for you.

I do this video in the morning before work, and though I wake up like a zombie, I am feeling great (and human again) by the end. I don't dread it, like I do all other workouts. I recommend the video to anyone who is bored with their current workout, or looking for something more than just a workout, because it's stimulating and relaxing at the same time. If you need a more intense workout, hopefully your health will allow it and just add a jog or walk to your routine, then enjoy this DVD on slower days or in combination with some cardio.",1262217600,,2317,4.324137931034483

2988124,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Denise does a great job of not only hitting the right pace, but of creating a gentle workout with yoga that doesn't require much previous experience to follow. I enjoyed her balance of poses and the sequences very much, especially because I came away feeling really well, and without any back or neck pain. I'm very happy with it; it is easy to complete all four sequences within an hour.",1249862400,,388,4.557142857142857
2988125,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I rarely write reviews on DVD's but this time I feel compelled --

I waivered between giving this video a four star and a five star, but I think it delivers on what it promises, at least for the ""Burn"" and ""Rejeuvenation/Relaxation"" segments.  I just bought this and only did 2 ""complete workouts"" out of the total four possible.  Normally, I would hesitate to read somebody's comments on a DVD they just did for the 1st time, never mind someone such as myself who hasn't even done the other 2 segments yet.  However, I am compelled to write this because: (1) often with workouts, first impression is everything - If you hate it the first time out of the gate, you're highly unlikely to go back to it, (2) Denise's cueing, LONG an issue with me and her workout videos, can be awful and off-putting so that you don't even want to TRY one of her vids, and (3) her talking is encouraging to some, annoying to others (most often to ME!) and you know your first time watching if the talking or the background/sets, music, etc. are going to bother you.

Until extremely recently, I have hated yoga, gotten no benefits from it, and found it to be completely ineffective.  But a handful of videos, and circumstance, have changed my mind lately.

Now, first a word about weight loss -- that's often why we all come here, right?  Having just done 30 minutes of her 50 minute segmented video, I can't say whether it works for weight loss or not, but I CAN tell you why I'm using it and what this kind of yoga (+ Kundalini yoga) have done for me so far.  I have a lower back injury and am in physical therapy for it.  I was told I can only ride an exercise bike.  I can't do bouncy cardio or step or even weight lifting (to tell the truth, I'm not too sad about any of this, however, especially now that I've found some yoga DVD's I actually LIKE; may never go back to the other types of exercising and I was a very advanced exerciser for years so I know what I'm talking about).

Since I'm an all-or-nothing person and am on a weight-loss/fitness kick again after a LONG (too long!)time, I knew I HAD to do something and for many reasons chose yoga, which I've never really liked.  Along with diet (I use [...] software and/or download program and have had complete success EVERY time I have used it and it does NOT tell you what to eat or how/when to exercise!!  Just check it out - It's around $60 for a one-time fee only and I have loved it for years.), I've been doing yoga (10 Minute Solution yoga, one segment each morning, a very short segment of Quigong from a 12 segment DVD I have, and about 20-40 minutes of Fat Free Yoga (Ani & Ravi) a day. So, back to my point.  While I can't ""speak to"" this video in particular, I CAN say that since July 20th (it's August 1st today), I have lost 9.5 lbs. doing what I just told you.  Almost TEN POUNDS in two weeks!  I am 5'6"" and am often told I ""carry my weight well"" or that I don't need to lose weight (I do and the doctors know, what with my BMI being what it is!) but I started this at 172 pounds and in my life I have, as an adult, dropped to 123 on phen-fen and MAXED OUT at a whopping 208 and everything in between.  So I've been around the diet, nutrition, fitness and exercise block for years.  In the interest of full disclosure, I AM on prescription phentermine (37.5) temporarily as an appetite suppressant (saw my endocrinologist for this; hypothyroid).  However, the pills aren't producing the weight loss, they're only helping with appetite.  What I'm DOING is what is dropping the weight.

I've ordered 2 more DVD's with good reviews on here (a weight loss yoga & a yoga/pilates blend) but I wanted something else to add into the mix until they got here. Today I went to Target (sorry Amazon but I DO buy a lot from you, especially here lately!) and against my own norm - withOUT reading reviews -- I bought this DVD.  It was between this & Susan Deason's Quick Start Weight Loss DVD.  I almost walked off with Deason knowing how Denise can grate sometimes, but I've done a Deason weight loss yoga vid before and frankly was bored to tears by it.  Nice scenery -- okay.  Not my thing while working out, just get my mind and body engaged in my physical being and motion.  Don't let me get bored, whatever you do.  However, at the last minute I picked up Austin's Yoga and walked up to the register.  I haven't done her vids in a long time -- take a chance, I told myself.

I'M GLAD I DID!  Denise's yoga DVD's are, for some reason, much better than all her other workouts, in my opinion.  (I've done a yoga/pilates one she did and it was very good.)  I got home and immediately read the Amazon reviews before doing the video.  After reading many of these, thinking WHAT HAVE I DONE?, I expected horrible cueing and, depending on whose post you read, either very challenging moves for the advanced which I kind of dreaded or easy moves for the beginners which wouldn't necessarily do me any good (I DO consider myself at the beginning level although I'm not completely new at this).  Taking a deep (yoga) breath, I went on in and did the workout.

Point 1:  The criticism that this is not a purist's yoga.  True enough.  It's a physical yoga, though, that does take on breathing and posing adequately enough to create the ""burn"" she's talking about in the title.  No, this is NOT meditative in any respect but if you're in it for the body movements and yoga benefits, this is for you. If you are looking for the entire existential mind/body/spirit in-depth exploration of yoga, while Denise touches on these things, this is NOT the DVD for you.

Point 2:  The ""challenge"" vs. ""ease"" criticism.  I am no yoga guru, expert, etc. nor am I a complete novice but I'm pretty close.  THIS DVD IS A VERY NICE BALANCE OF PACE, EASE AND CHALLENGE.  Very do-able but ""burning"" and ""working"" without hurting you or making you fear the next move or how long you have to hold a pose.  Almost fun!  :)  Evenly paced, fluid, lets you think about what you're doing but NEVER in any place of the video does it get BORING!!!  Big point with me.  I have absolutely NO DREAD FACTOR in the thought of doing this again and again.

Point 3:  The criticism that Denise talks a lot.  Yes, that's a valid critique to those of us familiar with her work.  She really, genuinely is Ms. Sunshine and I am most certainly not.  However, I found most of her talking relevant, guiding, and CUEING in this DVD.  Most of the time, she was either talking about form/how to do the pose correctly or how to move into the next one.

That leads me to...

Point 4:  The criticism that Denise's cueing is horrible.  Traditionally, she's one of the worse ""cue-ers"" in the business although she's great at what she does.  I wasn't looking forward to her cueing at ALL for this after reading the reviews.  Again, I'll use that word ""dread"" -- I dreaded how awkward this workout might possibly be if her cueing was off (I hope I'm spelling the whole ""cue"" thing right!).  I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED at how smooth and flowing this workout went!  I only missed a couple of very minor cues and was fairly easily able to change pose and catch up.  I don't think even those missed cues were her fault -- that seems to be true in ALL yoga I've done because it's hard to listen to ""silence"" sometimes for cues and it's REALLY hard to look at the screen with eyes closed in deep breathing, stretching to the ceiling looking up, sun salutations, downward dog, etc. -- It's pretty darned intrinsic in the art form that you won't be facing the screen much!  I looked away several times to see if I could still keep up without watching and I could with only minor glitches.

Anyway, this has become a ramble but I hope it's useful.  This STAYS in rotation!!!!  I look forward to doing the rest of it.  I can tell and feel from my experience that this one will be a good one for burn and tone.  Either use it in your cardio/strength rotations or, if you're like me and have to/want to stick to yoga for whatever reasons, this one stays near or at the top of the heap.  Wonderful workout in 30 MINUTES and I'm going to make it 50 MINUTES, mix it up and change it up.  It will NOT collect dust and it delivers what it packages itself to be.  Even if Denise has annoyed you before, as she has me, ....well, I can't speak for you but I like her and I LOVE this video!  Worth the money, especially if it's to put into a rotation of videos for a bit of well-paced, easy/hard variance.  THE PACE WAS PERFECT.  And the segments I did weren't too long or too short.  Just right, so sayeth Goldie Locks without the golden locks. :)

ENJOY!  (P.S.  If set matters much to you, this one was a beautiful, Zen-simplistic indoor one with a waterfall in the background.  2 other practitioners with her but weren't distracting at all)",1249084800,2,8810,4.348651960784314

This particular DVD I find completely annoying since she doesn't shut up! I couldn't get passed the first minute of it. She seems to have a DVD for everything but she is the master of nothing and certainly not yoga. Not professional, keeps talking beyond the necessary explanations. If you are serious with yoga you should try other DVDs of well-known and recognized instructors (Rodney Yee, Barbara Benagh).",1245974400,,545,5.066666666666666

Like many people have already said; this DVD is not for beginners b/c there is minimal instructions. BUT... To be honest, I kind of like that because I dislike when instructors waste time describing the asanas.  If you are very familiar with yoga and want a FAST-Paced yoga workout, this is a winner.  There is no spiritual aspect to this DVD(and I have a few RAVI ANA, Shiva Rea, and Gurmukh DVDS for that) This is short, sweet and to the point.  I have not done a Denise Austin DVD  since college, but this DVD is one of the best!!!! I was was definately working more intensely at this video.  Some people may not like the fast cuing, but I think that is what makes this video so challenging and effective.  If you like slower paced and easier yoga, 10 minute yoga solutions is probably better for you.  Also, I love ALL the poses especially dancers pose and pigeon pose. One more thing.. So many of the poses on the entire DVD are excellent for runners. Since I workout and run almost everyday, I feel this DVD is perfect. I never thought I would say this about a Denise Austen DVD, but this is my favorite yoga DVD!!",1241654400,,1207,4.3097345132743365

Although I enjoyed the work-out, I agree with the other reviewer who said that Denise does a poor job of cueing or explaining the moves/positions before she begins doing them. A few times I had to stop the DVD, because I was in plank pose with my head facing the floor, so that I could see what she was doing. I was unable to follow otherwise.
This is a challenging work-out, but not so difficult that you won't be able to keep up if you sometimes pause to see what Denise is doing. I think that after doing this work-out a second or third time it will be easy to follow.",1241049600,,702,4.169117647058823

2988144,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This might not be a favorite with really, really serious yoga enthusiasts.  And at first,I thought ALL of Denise's videos were ""hokey"".  But Denise makes exercise accessible to ALL of us.  I really don't have the time to do some of the 60-90 minute yoga videos.  But Denise's segments of 20 minutes or 10 minute sections is something ANYONE can do.  And she does pack alot of yoga into this tape.  I agree that the sequences are efficacious and flow nicely.

I've changed my opinion of Ms. Austin.  Her videos are fun and good for you!",1236297600,,535,4.5
2988145,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Denise has truly perfected her own brand of yoga with this dvd. This is not for yoga purists and I'm a little tickled that anyone would even expect a traditional, authentic yoga practice from a Denise Austin video!

But if you like a challenging (but not so hard that it's discouraging) workout incorporating the incredible strengthening and stretching benefits of yoga with fun new moves, then this is for you.

First off, this is by far the most beautiful indoor set on a fitness dvd and the visuals transform this from a workout into an experience (the gorgeous music doesn't hurt, either).

Denise avoids boring repetitions so often found in other power yoga dvds; as a result, this dvd is packed with so many inventive variations of traditional yoga moves (like the ""Eagle Crunch"") that time just flies.

The fast pace of the dvd adds the benefits of cardio to what is essentially a full-body strengthening and stretching workout. The stretching moves are consistently intertwined within the strengthening exercises, so soreness is greatly alleviated (although attempting the crow pose was definitely too much for my wrists).

I generally do the entire program but I love the fact that it can also be done as four separate workouts (and although one targets legs and one targets abs, trust me when I say that you will feel your entire body engaged in these segments!).

I have dozens and dozens of other workout dvds (including most of  Denise's) but I can't bear to do any besides Yoga Body Burn, Hit the Spot Pilates, and Body Burn Dance and Pilates (also by Denise). Those three give me the most intense, all-encompassing workouts that my body needs and I am so addicted to them!",1235606400,10,1687,4.8166089965397925
2988146,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I've tried Denise Austin's DVDs before and have always found them fast paced and advanced there is no beginner for her.  She moves quite quickly and doesn't always cue what she's wanting you to do.  She's great for someone who is very in shape and used to the quick.  But she advertises this for beginner to intermediate and that is very misleading.  The cooldown was more my pace and reminded me of correct position in some of the moves that I haven't used in a while.

I'll come back to this once I've gotten back in to shape.  For now I've ordered a Suzanne Deason DVD to help me.  She's more instructive and allows you to learn the poses before rushing you throught to something else.",1235520000,,688,4.412698412698413

2988149,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I purchased this DVD having never tried yoga before. But I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. In fact, I had a lot of fun doing this and I could feel my whole body being worked. This video is broken down into 4 Sections. Yoga Burn is a 20 minute yoga cardio/strengthening routine and is fun and gets you sweating. Yoga Legs and Yoga Abs are each 10 minutes and focus on poses and moves to strengthen their respective areas. I found both of these to possess the right amount of challenge to really work the muscle groups. Finally, there is the Yoga Relax section which is just like it sounds. The point with this section is to get you to cool-down after the workout or to do when you are tense and it, too, is only 10 minutes long.

The poses presented in the video are mostly for beginners (which is exactly what I am) but Denise does a great job at providing ways to make them more challenging. Also, she provides modifications (which is great for people like me). She has an upbeat personality and says things like ""Bring it back up to where I can see your smiling face,"" and ""This is all about what you can do."" She's encouraging and you'll get a really great work out, I promise!

Overall, this video is fun, challenging, and worth the price. There really isn't much more you can ask for in a work-out DVD. If you're even the slightest bit interested in this DVD, I suggest that you purchase it. You'll really enjoy yourself!",1233446400,2,1437,4.398496240601504

2988151,3,B000WOSAUQ,"I remember Denise from back when I used to do Aerobics.  I remembered her as energetic and ""bouncy"" .. I had a hard time imagining her leading a yoga routine.  My concerns were valid, she has lost none of that energy and I kept wanting to ""shush"" her.  I don't need someone telling me to ""make it burn"" or ""you can do it"" or any of those things during yoga.  Talk about the pose, make sure the viewer is doing it right, but for me, yoga is also about being in my own body .. feeling the pose quietly.  I found Denise's constat chit chat very distracting.  I really think that she just can't stop talking, she is just plain high energy.  There is nothing about her instruction that is quiet or spiritual.  It's aerobic instruction to a yoga routine.  For me, it was very annoying.  But if you like Denise then you might like her enthusiasm.  I just kept expecting her to pop up and start a high energy aerobic routine.  It was almost painful to watch her have to control her energy to ""quietly"" do yoga.

The routine itself is challenging.  It takes going through it a couple times to get the flow.  Some parts of it are quicker than I am used to and she doesn't walk you through these parts, you have to watch her.  Once you do that she's done with the pose and it's too late for you to do it.  But on the second or third try you remember what comes next and it flows well.  She does some tough poses and she does not give you modifications, she just says only do this if you can.  It's not very helpful, but if you've done some yoga before doing this dvd then you know the modifications and you can move through the poses.  She is strong and she does give you something to aspire to.

I did really like some of the poses on this tape and I really liked the ab work out.  I find myself adding in some of the things from this dvd when I am doing other dvd's.

But in the end, I had a hard time not giggling when she pulled her hands in together at the end and said ""Namaste"" with a huge grin and much enthusiasm.  I'm drinking coffee before I do this tape next time.  I might better appreciate Denise's enthusiasm once I've got some caffeine flowing through my body.",1225065600,4,2165,4.159036144578313
2988152,3,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a great DVD! I have to agree with the previous reviewers, this is not for beginners typically. With that being said, a group of 14 of us of different yoga levels did this during our break today (some of us being brand new to yoga, while others of us are quite advanced) and we all kept up just fine. Denise does do crow pose which is highly advanced (as a previous reviewer noted) but also the others on the DVD show the modifications.

2988154,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I like many have a lot of Denise Austins tapes and though I typically find her babble annoying, her workouts are usually terrific. I was excited to get a new Yoga DVD and get started. What a disappointment. I have been doing Yoga for 4 years and as a fitness instructor/personal trainer I am pretty confidant in the poses and breath involved. I could barely keep up with her transitions back and forth between moves she went so fast. You had no time to actually get into a pose before she was on to the next. Yoga is holding a pose for at least a few seconds before moving, this definetly does not qualify.
As with other reviews I to had a hard time seeing what she was doing and she very rarely named the pose you were moving into or cued it. I'll have to watch again, but I think she actually miss named one or two poses when she did name them.
Maybe Denise needs to stick with the cardio workouts where she is truly great.",1215043200,3,925,4.202247191011236

2988157,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I have to second (or third?) the prior review by Bowers.  I love Denise Austin, and own yoga/Pilates videos by her which I found to be great.  However, trying this one out, I felt like I needed to just *watch* several times in order to know what I was supposed to be doing.  There were a few times where I thought I was supposed to hold a position, and looked up to see that she was doing other movements while babbling encouraging words.  I'd rather be told what to do, thank you.  There were also times where she spoke as if her audience were yoga pros and knew what was meant when she gave the names of poses.  Some of them (e.g. pigeon) I was only vaguely familiar with.  She doesn't give you a lot of time to get into position, either.  I know the workouts are short, but I'd rather ""waste"" a few seconds understanding how to get into position than waste several minutes while she does the exercise and I'm left clueless.  Or she could have added an instructional section so that you can learn the poses independently of doing a workout.  Also, I think there were only a couple of exercises in the Ab section that actually hit the abs.  I like that the workouts are short and can be combined however you like, but 10 Minute Solution does that a LOT better.  I also think it's nice that there is a music-only option, which is extra nice given the lack of good instruction.  Nonetheless, my copy of this DVD is getting sold.",1210723200,4,1427,4.319548872180451

Responding to the person who thought it was too fast for yoga, the description on the dvd says it all ""Yoga moves at an aerobic pace."" I had no knowledge of yoga so the first time was difficult but I caught on very quickly. Once you memorize it, it becomes a lot easier to follow. Those of you who gave up on the first try, shouldn't have. My only complaint is Denise Austin's voice and her little sayings are annoying beyond belief. ""Oooo how do you feel?"" ""Let me see those smiling faces"" ""You're like a living structure!"" or as you are in an impossible position and she starts up a conversation so you are in a position longer than you should ""You know what I like to do..."" ah shut up.

If anyone is interested in an all level yoga workout DVD/VHS, it would be Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga with Sarah Ivanhoe who gives excellent breathing instruction as well as prompts for poses.",1201219200,,554,4.555555555555555
3222433,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I love Denise Austin's routines. She is so upbeat and her workouts are fun! You should have some knowledge of yoga beforehand as this really is NOT an instructional DVD. Denise packs a lot of great yoga postures into a short amount of time, yet she holds the poses for a good amount of time and really doesn't seem rushed.

A reviewer said she does not cue well, but I think it's just fine: you should have some knowledge of yoga already and know about the positioning of your body in specific poses. Once you get used to the routine it is really easy to follow and quite fun!

You get 4 routines on the DVD and it's great because with the menus you can mix and match in any order you like. The first one is the longest and called Total Yoga Toning. It includes standing postures, most vinyasa style (lots of flow and movement). I especially like the next three: Legs, Abs, and Stretch; each one is approx. 10 minutes for a great quick 30 min yoga session. Some of the postures can be a bit of a challenge; this is much more traditional than I've seen from Denise in previous DVDs. The set is beautiful, bright orange blue water fall in the background.

This is not hard core yoga, but a lovely easy practice that will definitely brighten and start your day right. If you like Denise's other DVD, you will like this one. (If you don't like her voice, upbeat attitude, cueing, etc., you will probably not like this one either.) You can mute her voice and just have music, although I don't see the benefit of this option since you would have to constantly look up to follow along. (A choice of no music would be nice then I could add my own, but that option is not available on this DVD.)

I was wondering does she think I have eyes like a spider that I can see the TV while facing down on the floor mat.  She also doesn't give you sufficent time to get into the yoga poses.  Moves to quickly to enjoy yoga.  I was extremely upset and ready to ditch the DVD.  I thought yoga is suppose to be calming but not with Denise Austin.  Oh and lets not forget her voice - annoying.  I just started Yoga a year ago and watch Steve Ross on Oxygen at 6:00 am, and also brought Ellen Barrett super slimdown crunch: Pilates Yoga Blend and I can say now they know how to cue.  I had purchased a Denise Austin video years ago and it was the same issue - her cueing, out of sequence or never called out.

I was hoping this one would be a good challenge and it is!  I have only done the ""Yoga burn"" segment, but that was enough for today.  I used to go to a yoga class down the street, but with my schedule it has become tough.  This workout reminds me a lot of my yoga class(which i was really wanting to fit into my schedule) that made me feel so good!  You do moves such as cobra, downward dog, upward dog, balancing stick, soaring eagle, chair and more(I can't remember all the names).  What is really challenging about this is doing all the moves in a quick sequence for the ""yoga burn"".  So if you are familiar with most yoga positions, you should be ok doing this workout, but like me, you may have a challenge in doing the sequences!!  Practice makes perfect, so enjoy the challenge!",1199664000,5,930,4.179775280898877
3222439,2,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a slightly more advanced workout than we usually get from Denise.  I was surprised to see her do The Crow, for instance.  However, I have to give her low marks for her cueing on this workout.  This is a pet peeve of many who exercise with her, but I usually don't mind her cheery babble.  This one's pretty bad that way, though.  As she does so infuriatingly on her TV shows, she puts you in a position where you can't see the TV, then says something like ""Put your hands right here.""  Right where?  While I'm doing a free workout on Lifetime, I don't mind.  When I've bought a DVD which should have had more planning (perhaps a script?), I expect more.  While I liked the workout, I found myself getting mad by the time she put me in Corpse Pose and told me to clear my mind.

If you've never done yoga before, don't start here -- it moves too fast (at an aerobic pace), and Denise will have you thoroughly confused.  (Beginners -- try the excellent Yoga Zone DVDs.)  You'd never know it by this review, but I'm actually a fan of Denise's.  Her recent Hit The Spot Pilates is one of my all-time favorites.  I'm just disappointed that after all her years as a fitness instructor, she's still so bad at cueing.",1199145600,53,1217,4.3039647577092515
3222440,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Here is the synopsis from Denise:  In Yoga Body Burn, Denise Austin guides you through a dynamic vinyasa of workouts designed to burn fat, sculpt lean legs, flatten the tummy, and rejuvenate the body. Whether combined or performed individually, these yoga workouts will incinerate fat and improve your body's overall tone and flexibility in no time. The DVD features YOGA BURN, which ignites the body's internal furnace with aerobic-paced yoga moves that burn calories for an incredible fat meltdown; YOGA LEGS, which sculpts leaner, longer legs with dynamic yoga poses that challenge balance, flexibility, and strength; YOGA ABS, which strengthens and shrinks your midsection using core-focused yoga moves to define a trimmer, tighter tummy; and YOGA RELAX, in which you quiet your mind with a series of gentle yoga stretches that rejuvenate and refresh the body.",1198368000,11,864,5.352941176470588

Standing pose section can be done with light weights to add challenge. One Caution:  Denise goes through the chair pose prayer twists too rapidly for beginners and/or if you have a bad/sensitive back.
The 10 minute legs is excellent and powerful.
 10 minute yoga abs Killer eagle crunches and prayer twist crunches really works hard the tough to reach lower belly--however a Caution here: you may get a sore neck if you are a beginner, have a bad neck and or weak neck.  I recommend  support with a neck roll or small pilates ball to lay the back of your head down on.  I'm an intermediate and I use one hand to support my head in all of the crunches in this segment at least part of the time.",1481155200,10,868,4.427672955974843

I like the fact that Denise Austin encourages you during the entire workout. Love the fact that she emphasizes that yoga is about what YOU can do.
I LOVE the fact that the workouts are customizable. Feeling ambitious? Add one of the 10 minute workouts to the original 20 minute workout.
The original workout is what I call a ""Goldilocks Workout"" Not too short, not too long, just right. All in all, I'd say this was a good workout for people with a little yoga experience already under their belts.",1470787200,,695,4.523809523809524

This is not for the beginner though, learn the basic yoga moves before moving on to these routines.  She flows at a very nice pace and believe me, you will break a sweat.  I completed all four workouts one after the other, and felt great after.  The relax/cool down is just enough.  Each routine is not too long, but enough to get a great workout in.  I purchased this to change up my routines during the week, and now I can complete more yoga workouts.  I workout hard, aerobically, weight training, yoga and walking, and wanted to add more stretch to my weekly activity, and this dvd surely does just that.

3222504,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I didn't get this one. Seems like when you try to fuse two completely separate things (relaxing yoga and intense fat burning exercising) you tend to lose out on both accounts; you don't get yoga's soothing stretching and relaxation and you don't get any sort of fat burning, muscle building exercises since she doesn't do enough reps of each and for not enough time. I mean, how much leg building can you do in 10 minutes, especially when you only do 2-3 reps of each? I didn't get much of a workout with this tape. No cueing, no instruction, and her voice did not go well with the wanna-be relaxing yoga-ish style of this DVD. Even the ladies in the background looked confused at times.  If you want to burn calories, get a fast moving aerobic DVD, if you want yoga, get a yoga tape, but don't try to mesh these two completely different things together, it doesn't work.

You should know a thing or two about yoga, be in at least somewhat decent shape, and do this video several times to learn the flow. Given all that, it's a great video for your rotations.

I like that I get a chance to do several different yoga moves (instead of doing only 2 or 3 moves for the entire workout), and I like how she moves quick to ""generate heat."" You can do one full workout or 3 individual workouts with a bonus relaxation workout. The main workout is 20 minutes and the others are 10 minutes each. I enjoyed doing the main workout on youtube and decided to purchase the DVD. I don' t think this is for beginners, but if you like yoga and have some experience and want something other than the typical yoga workout, go for it.

You don't hold the poses at all and are moving so quickly from pose to pose that I literally could not keep up or figure out what the heck she was doing half the time.  There was no emphasis on breath, this was not restorative whatsoever because she is talking the whole time and because the pace is so ridiculously fast.  I felt like this was more of a traditional workout video that uses yoga poses, NOT a yoga practice.  I threw this in the giveaway pile immediately after using it was that bad.

3222564,4,B000WOSAUQ,"Really nice video. It has a 3 20-min sections: one cardio, one abs and one legs; and one 10 min section of stretching. It has a cool feature that allows you to select which sections you want and plays it consecutively, so you don't have to stop and select the next session to start in the middle of your work out. I also like that you can chose to play it with music only, or with the spoken instructions.  At first I though Denise sounded a little to perky and obnoxious, but it works well in the work out.  I'm young, but not into exercise, and half way through the cardio section and I was out of breath. I thought I did enough work for legs in the cardio and and haven't felt the need to do the legs section yet.
The only thing is that it is a bit fast for yoga, not very true to yoga tradition, in my opinion. So it's more of a workout than a yoga video. If you are really into yoga, and looking to deepen your practice, this may not be the video for you.

I then found this DVD again my sophomore or junior year of college. I didn't like it so much because I had taken a yoga class and I actually cared about what the poses felt like and I wasn't sure about what I was doing on my own.  That was the only time I did it.  I've been practicing yoga more seriously for about 2 years now so I know what the poses are supposed to feel like and look like.  I agree with people who say that this is for more intermediate practitioners who what things are supposed to feel like. I didn't mind doing it today.  I also think that the sequence where she goes from side angle to reverse warrior should be a little bit slower. Not by much, but just slow enough so you can take a better breath.  Other than those things, I felt fine doing it.  Like I said earlier, I don't feel like this is much of a beginner video...she doesn't exactly explain the poses, which can cause injury.",1334188800,,1087,4.046728971962617

I have to say I was a little disappointed in that her instruction on each move is very fast, too fast for a yoga routine in my opinion, having taking yoga classes in the past.  Because I have to look up at the TV screen, I miss some of the routine because she moves on too fast.  If she would slow down for each move and give you more time, it would be perfect.",1332288000,,582,3.948717948717949
3222577,5,B000WOSAUQ,I like that there are 3 sections in the DVD so you can do as little or as much as you want.  It's easy to follow and she gives good directions so you know how to do each move.,1315699200,,175,3.4871794871794872
3222578,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This has many moves and you definitely feel them.  I was really surpised at the workout, all the balancing moves can be challenging. Plus, Denise is great in this dvd.  Usually she's goofy, but she is really in her element with this one.
Some other yoga dvds are slow and boring.  This one is not, yet you hold the poses a decent amount of time.",1313971200,3,345,4.276923076923077
3222579,1,B000WOSAUQ,I have used several DVDs and this is the WORST by far. There is no emphasis on the breath. No holding of poses. Even with a good vinyasa flow weight loss workout there is mindfulness of the breath and not just moving around as fast as you possibly can. Will not use again.,1308182400,,272,4.150943396226415
3222580,4,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a great workout. I am a big fan of Denise Austin. The only complaint I have is that her instructions could be better. She says things like ""place your hands here"" when you are not able to see the video to know where ""here"" is. The routine goes very quickly, and I sometimes feel rushed moving from one position to the next. I have done the workout only a few times and it seems to get easier to transition between moves each time I do the workout. My advice would be try not to get discouraged until you have done the workout a few times.",1307491200,2,546,4.11214953271028

3222582,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a great DVD!

As other reviewers have said there are 4 sections.  My favorite is the fat-burning yoga or 1st section.  It includes poses like warrior 2, chair, triangle, warrior 3, pose of the dancer, balancing stick, vinyasa flows, twists, splits, downward dog, eagle, and even a squat and crow.  I definitely think it is a good workout.  It is 20 minutes almost exactly.

The next 3 sections are legs, abs, and relaxation.  Each is 10 minutes.  The leg section is fun but was not particularly challenging for me except a move at the end where you stand on your side on one leg with one hand down and lift the other leg in the air.  The ab section is not very challenging either but I enjoyed it.  The relaxation session I believe does offer relaxation.

The 1st 2 sections are done with Denise and 2 other female participants and the last 2 are Denise by herself.  All of the verbal instructions are live and not voiceover which I really like.  The music is non-annoying.  I definitely recommend this DVD!",1298419200,5,1015,4.5054945054945055

I had read good things about Body Burn so I thought I'd give it a go.  I honestly like Yoga Buns better, but I also enjoyed Body Burn.  I like how it's split into sections- a 20 minute section on burning and all different poses, 10 minutes on legs, 10 minutes on abs, and 10 minutes on relaxation stretches.  Some of the poses in this DVD are the same as in Yoga Buns, but I feel like this DVD is more fast paced with less instruction, which is fine for me, but for a beginner it might be hard.  I think Denise is more peppy in Yoga Buns.  If you like Yoga and are looking to mix up your routine, I would recommend this DVD!",1298160000,9,733,3.918918918918919

It is challenging enough to make you feel good that you accomplished something and it is not so difficult that you don't wanna turn on the TV again.  I had more energy and felt more alert in just a couple of days than I had in a really long long time!  Totally recommend it to at least get started for those of you who want to do something but don't have much time; just set aside 20 mins a day and you're done!,1282694400,,503,3.8173076923076925

I think the 50 minute length (20 min. power yoga, 10 min. legs focus, 10 min. abs focus, 10 min. cool-down stretching) is good, and I like how certain segments focus on the legs and abs. This would be difficult for someone who is not already familiar with yoga poses, as Denise moves very quickly through the sun salutations. The fast pace is optimal though for anyone wanting to lose weight as well as add tone from their workout.",1280361600,,483,4.5

Her wonderful voice is so encouraging and supportive that after doing this DVD for a month I rarely look up - I just follow her instructions. It leaves me so relaxed - stress free and energized. I am doing it sometimes with my 7 year old girl and it is a great bonding experience for us. It is my absolutely favorite work out. I do not even want to go to the gym after i have it. I am getting ready to my third pregnancy doing it every day and I feel a great difference even after a month. I am looking to get her pregnancy DVD next. It is also such a great stress reliever. She moves fast through the poses and time flies. I am a fit person, but I feel the best in a long time after only practicing this workout for a few weeks. Cant say enough.

You can do 1, 2, or all 3 of the 10 min. sessions and/or the body burn session. I like to do this video on days after I have done pilates or strength training that left my muscles just a little sore and tense. I love Denise's upbeat 'you can do it' attitude! She helps you push a little harder without making you feel overwhelmed.",1274832000,,470,3.806122448979592
3222602,4,B000WOSAUQ,"I just recently started including yoga in my exercise routine.  I have Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and was looking for a yoga DVD that would provide certain levels of exercise and difficulty for me.  I'm 42 years old and at a healthy weight.  I don't have any disability yet.

The only other yoga DVD I've tried and enjoyed was from the P90X series.  P90X is a much longer workout, and it holds the poses longer than this one.  P90X is great, but it wasn't always convenient for my schedule or what I could do that day.

I admit, the first time I did Yoga Burn I was frustrated, because Denise held some of the poses for only a few seconds, and she did seem hard to follow.  However, each time I did the workout after that, I found that I was becoming more and more familiar with the routine and following along became much easier.

I like that I can customize the four workouts, selecting them according to my schedule and energy level for that day.  For a few of the more difficult poses, I can use a chair for balance if needed.  Some days I just need a good stretch, so I can take 10 minutes and simply do workout #4 anytime!",1273017600,3,1125,4.259433962264151

I think she has the perfect blend of difficulty (because you can always take the modification) and cardio.  Yes, she's not good at giving vocal instructions and she is guilty of holding a pose for different lengths of time on each side (my biggest pet peave). However, I'm still very happy with the dvd.  I can just look up to make sure I'm doing it right- next time I'll just know.  I've also counted out her holds a few times so that I know I'm doing things evenly. I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bath water. I do  mix of workouts and this one is any where from once a week to 3-4 times! I say its a buy.",1269993600,2,724,4.034965034965035
3222605,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I just did this DVD this morning and I know it will be one of the DVD's I keep coming back to.  What I love about this DVD and other Denise Austin yoga DVD's (Fat Blasting yoga, Power Yoga Plus) is that her yoga is DYNAMIC...meaning moving instead of just holding a pose for a long time.  I know many do not enjoy this way of doing yoga and they feel that Denise moves too fast. They would rather have the traditional type of yoga that is more meditative and holding poses longer. That is understandable and that kind of yoga is wonderful, too...but on most days when I want to feel energized (in the mornings) and get a good yoga workout in quick, and in a very fun way, I choose Denise Austin's yoga DVD's. The more meditative, restorative, holding the postures for longer I do in the evenings when I have more time and want to relax.

There is a lot of value in this DVD. There is the basic body burn (20 minutes), yoga abs (10), yoga legs (10) and yoga relax (10).  Today I did just the body burn and yoga abs and I felt I got a great workout and was ready to face the day.  I really appreciate how I only needed 30 minutes to feel great.  I also like how I can do any segments I want and get a nice, quick, refreshing work out in.  All the segments are interesting and fun.  I believe in all of them there were new ways of moving I have never done before. I love that.

If you like dynamic vinyasa...flowing fun yoga...then this DVD should not disapoint.",1268870400,4,1459,4.1453900709219855
3222606,4,B000WOSAUQ,"This was my first Yoga DVD.  I had never done Yoga before buying this DVD and now I am hooked on Yoga.  The workout is intense but easy on your joints.  Most of the Yoga poses were easy, but they definately worked your muscles.  Every time I do this DVD I feel great.  There are days when I don't have a lot of time and I just do the Yoga Body burn workout which is about 20 minutes long and after doing it I feel like I have spent an hour at the gym.",1267574400,,451,3.75531914893617
3222607,5,B000WOSAUQ,I also have her Yoga and Pilates DVD. This one is more intense and faster. It gets your heart pumping. I would recommend it.,1265760000,,124,4.208333333333333
3222608,4,B000WOSAUQ,"You should def have a little more knowledge on Yoga before trying this video. Other than that I thought it was great, the first time I tried it, it was a little difficult trying to see her doing the moves and doing them myself  at the same time since she moves quickly but thats why you have a pause and rewind button. Def got easier getting the right motions the second time around. I really like how upbeat she was,  I really enjoyed the moves def try it out !!!!",1262563200,,465,4.155555555555556
3222609,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I had never done yoga or pilates before this video; I had never used any workout DVD for that matter. But when I developed neuromas in both feet (painful nerve bundles), I could no longer do the exercises I have always done before (no running, elliptical, etc.), so I picked up this video in my search to find something low impact that WORKS, as I can't really supplement my workout with a quick jog. Boy am I glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised with the effects of yoga. It is refreshing, keeps me interested, and easy to do. And yes, it is a workout. The more I do the video, the more I am able to strengthen the poses by really flexing the muscles and adding some ankle / wrist weights. Plus the video contains 4 workouts that you can mix and match, so you can start with one and build up to do all 4 (though the 4th is more stretching/relaxation than a workout) for a longer workout. I have even done the 20 minute ""body burn"" workout twice back to back for an extended workout.

I hate to workout. (Who doesn't!?) But I actually found the video to be a great combination of an interesting workout (that I can feel) and some much needed de-stressing stretches and poses. The background music is gentle but upbeat and the set is nicely done. I have read a lot of other reviews that criticize Denise's cue-ing, and though I had never thought of this before, as the video never bothered me, I can see how it would annoy some. However, I have tried other beginner Yoga DVD's after being impressed with this one, and was more annoyed by other instructors' dry and flat instruction, as well as the general slowness of their routines. I guess I like a little more upbeat and a little faster pace. If you're bored with other yoga DVD's, this might be the right one for you.

I do this video in the morning before work, and though I wake up like a zombie, I am feeling great (and human again) by the end. I don't dread it, like I do all other workouts. I recommend the video to anyone who is bored with their current workout, or looking for something more than just a workout, because it's stimulating and relaxing at the same time. If you need a more intense workout, hopefully your health will allow it and just add a jog or walk to your routine, then enjoy this DVD on slower days or in combination with some cardio.",1262217600,,2317,4.324137931034483

3222621,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Denise does a great job of not only hitting the right pace, but of creating a gentle workout with yoga that doesn't require much previous experience to follow. I enjoyed her balance of poses and the sequences very much, especially because I came away feeling really well, and without any back or neck pain. I'm very happy with it; it is easy to complete all four sequences within an hour.",1249862400,,388,4.557142857142857
3222622,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I rarely write reviews on DVD's but this time I feel compelled --

I waivered between giving this video a four star and a five star, but I think it delivers on what it promises, at least for the ""Burn"" and ""Rejeuvenation/Relaxation"" segments.  I just bought this and only did 2 ""complete workouts"" out of the total four possible.  Normally, I would hesitate to read somebody's comments on a DVD they just did for the 1st time, never mind someone such as myself who hasn't even done the other 2 segments yet.  However, I am compelled to write this because: (1) often with workouts, first impression is everything - If you hate it the first time out of the gate, you're highly unlikely to go back to it, (2) Denise's cueing, LONG an issue with me and her workout videos, can be awful and off-putting so that you don't even want to TRY one of her vids, and (3) her talking is encouraging to some, annoying to others (most often to ME!) and you know your first time watching if the talking or the background/sets, music, etc. are going to bother you.

Until extremely recently, I have hated yoga, gotten no benefits from it, and found it to be completely ineffective.  But a handful of videos, and circumstance, have changed my mind lately.

Now, first a word about weight loss -- that's often why we all come here, right?  Having just done 30 minutes of her 50 minute segmented video, I can't say whether it works for weight loss or not, but I CAN tell you why I'm using it and what this kind of yoga (+ Kundalini yoga) have done for me so far.  I have a lower back injury and am in physical therapy for it.  I was told I can only ride an exercise bike.  I can't do bouncy cardio or step or even weight lifting (to tell the truth, I'm not too sad about any of this, however, especially now that I've found some yoga DVD's I actually LIKE; may never go back to the other types of exercising and I was a very advanced exerciser for years so I know what I'm talking about).

Since I'm an all-or-nothing person and am on a weight-loss/fitness kick again after a LONG (too long!)time, I knew I HAD to do something and for many reasons chose yoga, which I've never really liked.  Along with diet (I use [...] software and/or download program and have had complete success EVERY time I have used it and it does NOT tell you what to eat or how/when to exercise!!  Just check it out - It's around $60 for a one-time fee only and I have loved it for years.), I've been doing yoga (10 Minute Solution yoga, one segment each morning, a very short segment of Quigong from a 12 segment DVD I have, and about 20-40 minutes of Fat Free Yoga (Ani & Ravi) a day. So, back to my point.  While I can't ""speak to"" this video in particular, I CAN say that since July 20th (it's August 1st today), I have lost 9.5 lbs. doing what I just told you.  Almost TEN POUNDS in two weeks!  I am 5'6"" and am often told I ""carry my weight well"" or that I don't need to lose weight (I do and the doctors know, what with my BMI being what it is!) but I started this at 172 pounds and in my life I have, as an adult, dropped to 123 on phen-fen and MAXED OUT at a whopping 208 and everything in between.  So I've been around the diet, nutrition, fitness and exercise block for years.  In the interest of full disclosure, I AM on prescription phentermine (37.5) temporarily as an appetite suppressant (saw my endocrinologist for this; hypothyroid).  However, the pills aren't producing the weight loss, they're only helping with appetite.  What I'm DOING is what is dropping the weight.

I've ordered 2 more DVD's with good reviews on here (a weight loss yoga & a yoga/pilates blend) but I wanted something else to add into the mix until they got here. Today I went to Target (sorry Amazon but I DO buy a lot from you, especially here lately!) and against my own norm - withOUT reading reviews -- I bought this DVD.  It was between this & Susan Deason's Quick Start Weight Loss DVD.  I almost walked off with Deason knowing how Denise can grate sometimes, but I've done a Deason weight loss yoga vid before and frankly was bored to tears by it.  Nice scenery -- okay.  Not my thing while working out, just get my mind and body engaged in my physical being and motion.  Don't let me get bored, whatever you do.  However, at the last minute I picked up Austin's Yoga and walked up to the register.  I haven't done her vids in a long time -- take a chance, I told myself.

I'M GLAD I DID!  Denise's yoga DVD's are, for some reason, much better than all her other workouts, in my opinion.  (I've done a yoga/pilates one she did and it was very good.)  I got home and immediately read the Amazon reviews before doing the video.  After reading many of these, thinking WHAT HAVE I DONE?, I expected horrible cueing and, depending on whose post you read, either very challenging moves for the advanced which I kind of dreaded or easy moves for the beginners which wouldn't necessarily do me any good (I DO consider myself at the beginning level although I'm not completely new at this).  Taking a deep (yoga) breath, I went on in and did the workout.

Point 1:  The criticism that this is not a purist's yoga.  True enough.  It's a physical yoga, though, that does take on breathing and posing adequately enough to create the ""burn"" she's talking about in the title.  No, this is NOT meditative in any respect but if you're in it for the body movements and yoga benefits, this is for you. If you are looking for the entire existential mind/body/spirit in-depth exploration of yoga, while Denise touches on these things, this is NOT the DVD for you.

Point 2:  The ""challenge"" vs. ""ease"" criticism.  I am no yoga guru, expert, etc. nor am I a complete novice but I'm pretty close.  THIS DVD IS A VERY NICE BALANCE OF PACE, EASE AND CHALLENGE.  Very do-able but ""burning"" and ""working"" without hurting you or making you fear the next move or how long you have to hold a pose.  Almost fun!  :)  Evenly paced, fluid, lets you think about what you're doing but NEVER in any place of the video does it get BORING!!!  Big point with me.  I have absolutely NO DREAD FACTOR in the thought of doing this again and again.

Point 3:  The criticism that Denise talks a lot.  Yes, that's a valid critique to those of us familiar with her work.  She really, genuinely is Ms. Sunshine and I am most certainly not.  However, I found most of her talking relevant, guiding, and CUEING in this DVD.  Most of the time, she was either talking about form/how to do the pose correctly or how to move into the next one.

That leads me to...

Point 4:  The criticism that Denise's cueing is horrible.  Traditionally, she's one of the worse ""cue-ers"" in the business although she's great at what she does.  I wasn't looking forward to her cueing at ALL for this after reading the reviews.  Again, I'll use that word ""dread"" -- I dreaded how awkward this workout might possibly be if her cueing was off (I hope I'm spelling the whole ""cue"" thing right!).  I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED at how smooth and flowing this workout went!  I only missed a couple of very minor cues and was fairly easily able to change pose and catch up.  I don't think even those missed cues were her fault -- that seems to be true in ALL yoga I've done because it's hard to listen to ""silence"" sometimes for cues and it's REALLY hard to look at the screen with eyes closed in deep breathing, stretching to the ceiling looking up, sun salutations, downward dog, etc. -- It's pretty darned intrinsic in the art form that you won't be facing the screen much!  I looked away several times to see if I could still keep up without watching and I could with only minor glitches.

Anyway, this has become a ramble but I hope it's useful.  This STAYS in rotation!!!!  I look forward to doing the rest of it.  I can tell and feel from my experience that this one will be a good one for burn and tone.  Either use it in your cardio/strength rotations or, if you're like me and have to/want to stick to yoga for whatever reasons, this one stays near or at the top of the heap.  Wonderful workout in 30 MINUTES and I'm going to make it 50 MINUTES, mix it up and change it up.  It will NOT collect dust and it delivers what it packages itself to be.  Even if Denise has annoyed you before, as she has me, ....well, I can't speak for you but I like her and I LOVE this video!  Worth the money, especially if it's to put into a rotation of videos for a bit of well-paced, easy/hard variance.  THE PACE WAS PERFECT.  And the segments I did weren't too long or too short.  Just right, so sayeth Goldie Locks without the golden locks. :)

ENJOY!  (P.S.  If set matters much to you, this one was a beautiful, Zen-simplistic indoor one with a waterfall in the background.  2 other practitioners with her but weren't distracting at all)",1249084800,2,8810,4.348651960784314

Like many people have already said; this DVD is not for beginners b/c there is minimal instructions. BUT... To be honest, I kind of like that because I dislike when instructors waste time describing the asanas.  If you are very familiar with yoga and want a FAST-Paced yoga workout, this is a winner.  There is no spiritual aspect to this DVD(and I have a few RAVI ANA, Shiva Rea, and Gurmukh DVDS for that) This is short, sweet and to the point.  I have not done a Denise Austin DVD  since college, but this DVD is one of the best!!!! I was was definately working more intensely at this video.  Some people may not like the fast cuing, but I think that is what makes this video so challenging and effective.  If you like slower paced and easier yoga, 10 minute yoga solutions is probably better for you.  Also, I love ALL the poses especially dancers pose and pigeon pose. One more thing.. So many of the poses on the entire DVD are excellent for runners. Since I workout and run almost everyday, I feel this DVD is perfect.

3222628,4,B000WOSAUQ,"I did this work-out for the first time today. I've never done any type of Yoga before but have done Denise's Hit the Spot Pilates. Although I enjoyed the work-out, I agree with the other reviewer who said that Denise does a poor job of cueing or explaining the moves/positions before she begins doing them. A few times I had to stop the DVD, because I was in plank pose with my head facing the floor, so that I could see what she was doing. I was unable to follow otherwise.
This is a challenging work-out, but not so difficult that you won't be able to keep up if you sometimes pause to see what Denise is doing. I think that after doing this work-out a second or third time it will be easy to follow.",1241049600,,702,4.169117647058823
3222629,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a fantastic video for beginners who want to become more fluid in their yoga moves to burn some fat.  Despite the fact that you will break a sweat within 15 minutes, it is also fun!",1239840000,,188,4.081081081081081
3222630,5,B000WOSAUQ,It is a wonderful DVD for people like me who like to work out at home. I have a busy travel schedule and can tote this wherever I go.,1236556800,,133,3.6206896551724137
3222641,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This might not be a favorite with really, really serious yoga enthusiasts.  And at first,I thought ALL of Denise's videos were ""hokey"".  But Denise makes exercise accessible to ALL of us.  I really don't have the time to do some of the 60-90 minute yoga videos.  But Denise's segments of 20 minutes or 10 minute sections is something ANYONE can do.  And she does pack alot of yoga into this tape.  I agree that the sequences are efficacious and flow nicely.

I've changed my opinion of Ms. Austin.  Her videos are fun and good for you!",1236297600,,535,4.5
3222642,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Denise has truly perfected her own brand of yoga with this dvd. This is not for yoga purists and I'm a little tickled that anyone would even expect a traditional, authentic yoga practice from a Denise Austin video!

But if you like a challenging (but not so hard that it's discouraging) workout incorporating the incredible strengthening and stretching benefits of yoga with fun new moves, then this is for you.

First off, this is by far the most beautiful indoor set on a fitness dvd and the visuals transform this from a workout into an experience (the gorgeous music doesn't hurt, either).

Denise avoids boring repetitions so often found in other power yoga dvds; as a result, this dvd is packed with so many inventive variations of traditional yoga moves (like the ""Eagle Crunch"") that time just flies.

The fast pace of the dvd adds the benefits of cardio to what is essentially a full-body strengthening and stretching workout. The stretching moves are consistently intertwined within the strengthening exercises, so soreness is greatly alleviated (although attempting the crow pose was definitely too much for my wrists).

I generally do the entire program but I love the fact that it can also be done as four separate workouts (and although one targets legs and one targets abs, trust me when I say that you will feel your entire body engaged in these segments!).

I have dozens and dozens of other workout dvds (including most of  Denise's) but I can't bear to do any besides Yoga Body Burn, Hit the Spot Pilates, and Body Burn Dance and Pilates (also by Denise). Those three give me the most intense, all-encompassing workouts that my body needs and I am so addicted to them!",1235606400,10,1687,4.8166089965397925
3222643,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I've tried Denise Austin's DVDs before and have always found them fast paced and advanced there is no beginner for her.  She moves quite quickly and doesn't always cue what she's wanting you to do.  She's great for someone who is very in shape and used to the quick.  But she advertises this for beginner to intermediate and that is very misleading.  The cooldown was more my pace and reminded me of correct position in some of the moves that I haven't used in a while.

I'll come back to this once I've gotten back in to shape.  For now I've ordered a Suzanne Deason DVD to help me.  She's more instructive and allows you to learn the poses before rushing you throught to something else.",1235520000,,688,4.412698412698413
3222644,5,B000WOSAUQ,"This is my first time trying yoga so the first time at it I was like ""what did she say I got to do?""  as I am now facing away from the tv.  But I paused and rewind until I got it.  The third time around I was flowing through somewhat gracefully.  Now I'm having fun doing it.  I love Denise's energy.  She makes it fun.",1234742400,,319,3.757575757575758
3222645,5,B000WOSAUQ,She gives such a good workout.  She's vibrant and her energy is infectious.  This is a good workout video.  Great stretches.,1234224000,,124,4.809523809523809
3222646,5,B000WOSAUQ,"I purchased this DVD having never tried yoga before. But I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. In fact, I had a lot of fun doing this and I could feel my whole body being worked. This video is broken down into 4 Sections. Yoga Burn is a 20 minute yoga cardio/strengthening routine and is fun and gets you sweating. Yoga Legs and Yoga Abs are each 10 minutes and focus on poses and moves to strengthen their respective areas. I found both of these to possess the right amount of challenge to really work the muscle groups. Finally, there is the Yoga Relax section which is just like it sounds. The point with this section is to get you to cool-down after the workout or to do when you are tense and it, too, is only 10 minutes long.

The poses presented in the video are mostly for beginners (which is exactly what I am) but Denise does a great job at providing ways to make them more challenging. Also, she provides modifications (which is great for people like me). She has an upbeat personality and says things like ""Bring it back up to where I can see your smiling face,"" and ""This is all about what you can do."" She's encouraging and you'll get a really great work out, I promise!

Overall, this video is fun, challenging, and worth the price. There really isn't much more you can ask for in a work-out DVD. If you're even the slightest bit interested in this DVD, I suggest that you purchase it. You'll really enjoy yourself!",1233446400,2,1437,4.398496240601504
3222647,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Yeah its bouncy...yeah there are moments where the direction leaves a little to be desired...but this dvd works. You will notice results in your energy level immediately and looks within the first week.

I noticed that allover I was begining to be much more taut within about 5 days. This will not offer the medatative benefits of other programs so I will pair it up with Rodney Yee's A.M. Yoga for a cool down.",1231718400,,411,4.554054054054054
3222648,3,B000WOSAUQ,"I remember Denise from back when I used to do Aerobics.  I remembered her as energetic and ""bouncy"" .. I had a hard time imagining her leading a yoga routine.  My concerns were valid, she has lost none of that energy and I kept wanting to ""shush"" her.  I don't need someone telling me to ""make it burn"" or ""you can do it"" or any of those things during yoga.  Talk about the pose, make sure the viewer is doing it right, but for me, yoga is also about being in my own body .. feeling the pose quietly.  I found Denise's constat chit chat very distracting.  I really think that she just can't stop talking, she is just plain high energy.  There is nothing about her instruction that is quiet or spiritual.  It's aerobic instruction to a yoga routine.  For me, it was very annoying.  But if you like Denise then you might like her enthusiasm.  I just kept expecting her to pop up and start a high energy aerobic routine.  It was almost painful to watch her have to control her energy to ""quietly"" do yoga.

The routine itself is challenging.  It takes going through it a couple times to get the flow.  Some parts of it are quicker than I am used to and she doesn't walk you through these parts, you have to watch her.  Once you do that she's done with the pose and it's too late for you to do it.  But on the second or third try you remember what comes next and it flows well.  She does some tough poses and she does not give you modifications, she just says only do this if you can.  It's not very helpful, but if you've done some yoga before doing this dvd then you know the modifications and you can move through the poses.  She is strong and she does give you something to aspire to.

I did really like some of the poses on this tape and I really liked the ab work out.  I find myself adding in some of the things from this dvd when I am doing other dvd's.

But in the end, I had a hard time not giggling when she pulled her hands in together at the end and said ""Namaste"" with a huge grin and much enthusiasm.  I'm drinking coffee before I do this tape next time.  I might better appreciate Denise's enthusiasm once I've got some caffeine flowing through my body.",1225065600,4,2165,4.159036144578313
3222649,3,B000WOSAUQ,"This is a great DVD! I have to agree with the previous reviewers, this is not for beginners typically. With that being said, a group of 14 of us of different yoga levels did this during our break today (some of us being brand new to yoga, while others of us are quite advanced) and we all kept up just fine. Denise does do crow pose which is highly advanced (as a previous reviewer noted) but also the others on the DVD show the modifications. This is a challenge but one you find yourself wanting to work toward accomplishing without challenge! GREAT for the price!",1221609600,,566,4.4
3222650,5,B000WOSAUQ,"Despite any complaints listed - it says Yoga Burn - which means her goal is fat burning...not teaching all the ins and outs of yoga.  I have Yoga Buns and Fat Blasting Yoga...I love them all and am quite pleased with the results.  And now she has a feature where you can turn her talking off.  If you want quality instruction, I suggest you not be cheap and pay for a class instead of a dvd...as with any type of learning, it is easiest when you have a person who can coach/correct and answer questions.",1218585600,,503,4.273684210526316
3222651,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I like many have a lot of Denise Austins tapes and though I typically find her babble annoying, her workouts are usually terrific. I was excited to get a new Yoga DVD and get started. What a disappointment. I have been doing Yoga for 4 years and as a fitness instructor/personal trainer I am pretty confidant in the poses and breath involved. I could barely keep up with her transitions back and forth between moves she went so fast. You had no time to actually get into a pose before she was on to the next. Yoga is holding a pose for at least a few seconds before moving, this definetly does not qualify.
As with other reviews I to had a hard time seeing what she was doing and she very rarely named the pose you were moving into or cued it. I'll have to watch again, but I think she actually miss named one or two poses when she did name them.
Maybe Denise needs to stick with the cardio workouts where she is truly great.",1215043200,3,925,4.202247191011236

3222653,5,B000WOSAUQ,I really liked this.  I have never done yoga before in my life and this was pretty good for me..a beginner.

I enjoyed it doing this..great for beginners.,1211328000,28,317,4.943396226415095
3222654,2,B000WOSAUQ,"I have to second (or third?) the prior review by Bowers.  I love Denise Austin, and own yoga/Pilates videos by her which I found to be great.  However, trying this one out, I felt like I needed to just *watch* several times in order to know what I was supposed to be doing.  There were a few times where I thought I was supposed to hold a position, and looked up to see that she was doing other movements while babbling encouraging words.  I'd rather be told what to do, thank you.  There were also times where she spoke as if her audience were yoga pros and knew what was meant when she gave the names of poses.  Some of them (e.g. pigeon) I was only vaguely familiar with.  She doesn't give you a lot of time to get into position, either.  I know the workouts are short, but I'd rather ""waste"" a few seconds understanding how to get into position than waste several minutes while she does the exercise and I'm left clueless.  Or she could have added an instructional section so that you can learn the poses independently of doing a workout.  Also, I think there were only a couple of exercises in the Ab section that actually hit the abs.  I like that the workouts are short and can be combined however you like, but 10 Minute Solution does that a LOT better.  I also think it's nice that there is a music-only option, which is extra nice given the lack of good instruction.  Nonetheless, my copy of this DVD is getting sold.",1210723200,4,1427,4.319548872180451

3222659,4,B000WOSAUQ,"I thought that this was a very good dvd. I am definitely becomign more felxible and you can definitely feel the burn while doing it. Responding to the person who thought it was too fast for yoga, the description on the dvd says it all ""Yoga moves at an aerobic pace."" I had no knowledge of yoga so the first time was difficult but I caught on very quickly. Once you memorize it, it becomes a lot easier to follow. Those of you who gave up on the first try, shouldn't have. My only complaint is Denise Austin's voice and her little sayings are annoying beyond belief. ""Oooo how do you feel?"" ""Let me see those smiling faces"" ""You're like a living structure!"" or as you are in an impossible position and she starts up a conversation so you are in a position longer than you should ""You know what I like to do..."" ah shut up.
