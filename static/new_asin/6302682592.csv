502397,3,6302682592,"Errol Flynn (1909-59) made about a dozen westerns (""Virginia City"", ""Santa Fe Trail"", ""They Died with their Boots on"", ""San Antonio"") beginning with ""Dodge City"" (1939) and ending with ""Rocky Mountain"" (1950) even though Flynn was never comfortable with westerns. In his autobiography he said ""Putting me in cowboy pictures seemed to me the most ridiculous miscasting"" but the truth was he performed well in them and they generally did well at the box office.

In this one he plays a disgraced Union officer who gets into the gambling and mining businesses, woes a widow, and generally acts as a scoundrel, albeit a charming one.

Ann Sheridan (1915-67) appeared in more than 50 films, mostly in the late 30s and 40s, where she earned the nickname ""Oomph Girl"", before she made a move to TV. She appeared with Jimmy Cagney in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938), with Bogart in ""They Drive By Night"" (1940), with Ronald Reagan in ""Kings Row"" (1942), and with Cary Grant in ""I Was a Male War Bride"" (1949). Flynn enjoyed working with her and felt their films together ""furthered her career.""

Thomas Mitchell (1892-1962) is best remembered for his supporting roles as Scarlett O'Hara's father in ""GWTW"" (1939) and  Uncle Billy in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), although he often played in westerns( e.g., ""High Noon"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Destry"", ""Buffalo Bill""). Over a 38 year career he won an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony. He plays Flynn's friend and lawyer.

Bruce Bennett (1906-2007) plays Sheridan's husband. Bennett was a staple in B films in the 40s and 50s.

Barton MacLane (1902-69) is best remembered as the General from ""I Dream of Jeannie"" (1965-70). He and Bogart often appeared in films together (""The Maltese Falcon"", ""San Quentin"", ""High Sierra"", ""All Through the Night"", ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"") with Barton as the heavy. He reprises the villain's role in this one.

Raoul Walsh (1887-1980) directs. Though he's probably best known for his films with Errol Flynn, he was a master of the melodrama - ""Roaring Twenties"" (1939), ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""High Sierra"" (1941) and ""White Heat"" (1949) - and westerns - ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941), ""Colorado Territory"" (1949), ""The Lawless Breed"" (1953), ""The Tall Men"" (1955). He declined noticeably in the 50s after he left Warner Brothers, but his 50+ year career made him one of Hollywood's most memorable directors.

FWIW - this was Walsh's last film with Flynn.

Sid Hickox (1895-1982) handles the camera. Hickox made hundreds of films for Warner's and transitioned to TV in the 50s where he worked on ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Andy Griffith Show"". Though never nominated for any award, his camerawork was good, and he was responsible for films such as ""God is my Co-Pilot"" (1945), ""White Heat"" (1949), and my Hickox favorite, ""Dark Passage"" (1947). Hickox worked with Walsh on several films including ""Edge of Darkness"" (1943), ""Uncertain Glory"" (1944) and ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942). His work in this film is crisp and attractive, and his studio shots are well integrated into the on-location backgrounds.

Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) does a great job. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

Bottom line - It's not his best western - ""They Died with Their Boots On"" and ""Santa Fe Trail"" are definitely superior - but fans of Flynn will certainly enjoy the film.",1365897600,5,3592,4.95016611295681
502398,4,6302682592,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""SILVER RIVER"" (1948) (110 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Errol Flynn, Ann Sheridan, Thomas Mitchell, Bruce Bennet, Tom D'Andrea & Barton MacLane

Directed by Raoul Walsh

After being handed a dishonorable discharge during the Civil War, Mike McComb (Errol Flynn) becomes a professional gambler and follows a path of ruthless action to get what he wants. After moving out West and making a killing prospecting silver, McComb becomes a wealthy and powerful man, and he finds himself infatuated with beautiful Georgia Moore (Ann Sheridan). However, Georgia is married to Stanley Moore (Bruce Bennett), who works for McComb, so he arranges for Stanley to be given a dangerous assignment; Stanley is killed, and McComb sweeps the widowed Georgia off her feet. Georgia weds McComb, but in time she finds out the ugly truth about her second husband, leaving him behind. Devastated, McComb sets out to mend his ways and win Georgia back by serving more noble purposes.

""Silver River"" is an under-appreciated, near classic western, the complex, biographical-like plotting, solid performances by supporting actors and well choreographed overall action make this a clear four star winner.

""Silver River"" was the seventh Flynn vehicle directed by Raoul Walsh

Another great score by Max Steiner.

502399,4,6302682592,"Star Flynn and director Walsh worked together on two previous movies namely Gentleman Jim and They Died With Their Boots On. This was to be their final collaboration and it lacks the mythologising power of its predecessors but it still remains a solid Western of its era.
Flynn is  cast in a relatively unsympathetic role for once .He plays Mike McComb who starts the movie as an officer in the Civil War who burns $ 1 million  in payroll rather  than see it fall into Confederate hands an action resulting in him being cashiered .He moves West with gambling equipment purloined from crooked gamblers and opens  a saloon in Silver River where his rise to power and wealth is meteoric .He comes to own mines ,a bank and a grandiose mansion on the outskirts of town riding roughshod over opposition and with only raddled attorney Beck (Thomas Mitchell)to serve as a critic and conscience .He lovesGeorgia (Ann Sheridan)who is married to Stanley (Bruce Bennett)  whom he disposes of by  putting him in harms way during an Indian uprising .His methods disgust the townsfolk and Beck and his rivals gang up om him to bring him down
There are overtones of David and Bathsheba in the tale and the script also refers to Julius Caesar and Hamlet ,the movie  echoing their themes in part

The first part is a tale of how an Empire is built and its second ,darker part examines the process of downfall and redemption .It is  a relatively bleak movie for its era warning of the dangerrs posed by hubris and pride .Good performnces all round ,a rousing  score from Max Steiner and a glossy productiom  mean we get a strong but not classic studio system Western which all Flyn devotees will enjoy",1203465600,2,1682,4.648648648648648
502400,4,6302682592,"The previous opinions are similar to my own opinion , except I'll add that Ann Sheridan looks great in men's tight riding pants and tall boots. She has a fantastic alluring figure. Both Errol and Ann do strong confrontational roles.",1122163200,2,232,4.825
502401,3,6302682592,"Errol Flynn stars as an unfairly disgraced Union officer who decides to look out for number one in post-Civil War America.  He quickly builds a financial empire, methodically taking over Silver City, a town dependant on its silver mines.  Of course, a lot of people have to pay for his ambition and ruthlessness, and in the end, so must he.
Flynn's performance is better than usual throughout most of the film, his own personal sense of disillusionment no doubt contributing.  Ann Sheridan, as the feisty woman he loves, is stronger in the first half of the film.  Thomas Mitchell, as the sermonizing lawyer, gets some great speeches which he plays for what they are worth.
Unfortunately, the movie's moral message is laid on a bit heavy.  A little less talk and a little more action would have been an improvement.  Director Raoul Walsh is usually very good at mixing character development with action, but it doesn't come together here.  The actors and the director seem ""tired"" with this film, and the results show on the screen.  It's an average Western that probably could have been much more.",1068336000,12,1098,4.834224598930481
502402,4,6302682592,"Hang on to your Stetson. This is Errol Flynn in one of his best post World War 2 nuanced roles. From the riproaring opening on the Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg, where Flynn destroys a million dollars in Union  greenbacks,the way west to Silver City is paved with action,blind  ambition,lust and redemption. Mike McComb (Flynn) is a complex character.  He is a charming rogue and a ruthless competitor. McComb will traverse any  length to have what he wants when he wants it, be it a money making  enterprise or another man's wife. Flynn's character is a marvel to watch as  he climbs to the summit of power and finally pays the price for his  ambition. Supporting Errol in this entertaining morality tale are some  Warner Brothers' stock company pros. The lovely Ann Sheridan is both  elegant and earthy. Miss Sheridan matches Flynn's on screen charisma frame  for frame as the object of desire. Tom D'Andrea as Errol's friend and  bodyguard is affable in a solid performance. Thomas Mitchell returns from  an alcoholic fog and pulls off a credible performance as McCombs'  conscience. And how can Barton MacLane be anything but perfect as the  thuggish villian in this unusual western.
Here is a fifty-plus year old  movie with some very 1990's character sensibilities.",944524800,27,1277,4.9575471698113205

502455,5,6302682592,Very good film that parallels the corruption of King David with the main character. Both Errol Flynn (in a very deeply dramatic performance) and Ann Sheridan are a perfectly cast.

502461,5,6302682592,"Silver River is another great film showing what a fine actor Errol Flynn
was.  Really a shame that the film industry did not honor his acting
ability.  I have 26 of his films and am looking for some of the others
as well.

Totally enjoyable -- a really great western",1391990400,12,266,4.28
7830222,4,6302682592,The most interesting feature of this movie is that the 'hero' Errol is projected dishonourably. And he's just starting to turn as the booze catches up.. Pretty good print,1518652800,,170,4.896551724137931

7830224,3,6302682592,"An Errol Flynn worth watching once, but not twice. I found the situations improbable, including the burning of a million dollar Civil War Payroll Wagon, lightly guarded. The cast was more interesting than the story which dragged on and on, came off historically weak.",1508544000,,267,5.090909090909091

7830226,5,6302682592,"Ann Sheridan usually plays a character with a sharp tongue, quick wit. She gave a little of that in the beginning of the movie. It was classic Sheridan. Errol Flynn is usually the protagonist. In this movie he plays an utterly despicable rascal. It's only a movie but it was hard for me to accept Flynn's character. Hey that's my hang up. All in all this is a good movie.",1503964800,3,371,4.314285714285714

7830229,3,6302682592,"This version is supposed to be a Warner Bros. ""archive collection"". The copy I received had a very bad sound track in two places (at around 1:08 and 1:29) that lasted a little over three minutes each. The music was pulsing from 0 to a normal level, while the dialog stayed fairly even. It was hard to concentrate on the movie, which I love, so I sent it back with a description of the problem and ask for a replacement. It came today and has the exact same problem. So much for the ""archive collection"". I can't believe Warner Bros. originally released this version with these defects. I believe the problem is the 3rd party that burns the DVD+R on demand for Amazon. No concern for quality, just crank'em out.",1497312000,6,710,4.469230769230769
7830230,4,6302682592,"I've wanted this movie for many years. The first copy was defective, so I had to send it back. The second copy wasn't that great either.
The sound could have been better. The quality wasn't up to the usual Warner Brothers quality. Love the movie, and its stars.",1497052800,3,261,4.458333333333333
7830231,5,6302682592,one the best movies of Errol Flynns  that does not get enough credit. He is the Errol of course but stoty lets him branch out and show he could act,1494720000,,147,3.9
