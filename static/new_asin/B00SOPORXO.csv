8698981,4,B00SOPORXO,"as i have said in the past i LOVE this series the only thing keeping me from buying seasons 2, 3, and 4 is the fact that they are not dubbed in english, if they can do that in the future i would definetly buy them this is one of the best animes out there and i will keep hoping and praying that seasons 2-4 will be dubbed in english",1433635200,,332,3.757142857142857

8698984,5,B00SOPORXO,"I just finished watching Series 2 and even if I had to concentrate on the subtitles it was very enjoyable and a good buy. I get an Anime channel on AT&T and it had the first series a few months back but also subtitled. Now my real comment: the other night I watched a new SitCom from ABC - no subtitles - and like soo many of these it was bore even in English. I'm hooked on anime because the story lines are fresh, silly, thoughtful, enjoyable, artisitic, funny and not so real life. I've worked for 29 years in one of the largest Hospital's in the world - like being a Police officer without the title and a gun - and all the drama of all the soap operas you may have seen. So give me good anime anytime, I've had all the drama and dumb shows I can stand. Yes, I will be buying season 3 of Zero - you just know 2 was too open ended to leave standing alone.",1430524800,,858,3.9653179190751446
8698985,5,B00SOPORXO,"Familiar of Zero is a series full of laughs and good times; Rondo of Princesses is the third season of FoZ, so don't start here! That said, if you liked what you saw in previous seasons, you'll enjoy this. This series has romance, comedy, drama, and action; there is something here for many anime fans to enjoy. At the time of this review, this product is not yet released -- but I couldn't help spread the word that this IS a good show. However, if the quality from seasons one and two are any indication... this will be a solid release from Sentai Filmworks.

If you're looking to continue Familiar of Zero with the dub cast found in season one, unfortunately, you will not get that with this product. The dub for season one was produced several years ago for the 2008 release from Geneon, and it seems that Sentai Filmworks did not get choose to produce a dub for this title. Buyer, beware -- although it does clearly say on the Amazon page that it is Japanese with English subtitles.
That said, Rie Kugimiya is excellent as Louise, and the supporting cast members are excellent.

In summary, I think if you liked previous seasons of FoZ, you'll like this -- just make sure you're okay with reading subtitles beforehand. :)",1427328000,7,1226,4.542986425339366
8698986,1,B00SOPORXO,I loved the first season was so hyped in getting the other seasons til one thing killed it English sub. The most toxic thing to see on an anime guess I need to start learning to speak Japanese since so many good anime seasons are not coming to English dub like this one.,1426982400,2,270,4.113207547169812
