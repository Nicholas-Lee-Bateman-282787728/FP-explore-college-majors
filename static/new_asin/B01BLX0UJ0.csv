7664232,1,B01BLX0UJ0,"What a joke. Didn't even see the character on the cover, and the ""stars"" of the movie have miniscule, unnecessary roles. The settings are not correct for the story, shots heard from revolvers, shotguns and rifles all sound exactly the same and not like shots but some kind of muffled synthetic drum, and the over used  ""plot"" is presented with head-scratching flashbacks. Don't get took like I did. I made the fatal error of ordering it before reviews were available because I generally like the actor Jeff Fahey (who in this movie is essentially a no-show).",1465776000,,558,4.8125

8750597,1,B01BLX0UJ0,Roo! I like low budget westerns. But this one takes the cake! Wild Bill had long hair! They couldn't afford a wig for the actor? Plus their clothes look way too clean for a western. Some of the lines in it made me laugh. And they are some shaky camera work in it.  I like the gun sounds in it. But when they fire the guns no smoke ever comed from them. They only use a CGI light flash from the barrel. You would think they would have used gun powder caps to give an illusion like they did fire.,1532476800,,494,3.94
8750598,4,B01BLX0UJ0,Not the best movie I've ever watched for sure. For me a fair western is better than most any other genre.,1527379200,,105,4.0476190476190474
8750599,1,B01BLX0UJ0,"""The Six Million Dollar Lawnmower Man"" would have been a better title, and just as irrelevant.  There are movies that are so bad they are good, but this one is so bad it hurts.  I watched this solely on the basis of Lee Majors being in it.  If you are expecting him to be in a lead role because of the cover art, you would be grossly deceived and should demand your money back.  It is a very very small part, and he was lucky to have gotten a sack lunch in return.  Skip to the end.  There is an excellent uncredited piece of music there which I have so far been unable to put an artist name to.  He probably paid to stay uncredited -- No Joke!!!  If anything could redeem the film, it would be the end credit music. Unfortunately no diamond is big enough to justify digging through that much sewage to retrieve.",1509321600,,812,4.160256410256411
8750600,1,B01BLX0UJ0,Worst movie I ever watch....,1500076800,,28,4.8
8750601,1,B01BLX0UJ0,"If like myself you love a good Western or indeed American History you'll not be wanting to watch this under-par
effort.
Telling the tale of Wild Bill taking up a sheriff post in a small town, haunted by events of the past and having to
defend the town against a group of gun-totting rough-necks.
Sadly, the portrayal of Wild Bill was weak, the story-line was thin, the gun-fights unrealistic....yes it was obviously
a low-budget offering but it would not even in my view make it as a B-Movie.
Not sure how i sat through it in truth, only adding the review to hopefully help readers avoid this one.",1498608000,,597,4.537037037037037
8750602,5,B01BLX0UJ0,"While the film is undoubtedly low-budget, the some times seriously tragic and other times whimsically entertaining story shines through. The character ""Toggle"" is very well played and incredibly hilarious. In my opinion, the writers and directors did what they could with what they had. If you couldn't tell from the trailer that it was low budget, then you shouldn't have purchased/rented the film.

With that said, I highly recommend this film.",1474848000,,446,5.28169014084507
8750603,1,B01BLX0UJ0,"Ludicrous. If you dressed your kids up as cowboys this is the kind of film they would make. Or maybe better. With a really tired script, bad actors and completely inadequate direction it still may have rated another star if it wasn't filmed in what looks like someone's back yard. The fact that Jeff Fahey is on the cover art and (quit laughing or you'll miss it) briefly in the movie makes you wonder who he's related to responsible for this mess. Lee Majors does some bookend ""explanations"" about the old west to a kid who looks like he misses his xbox. He's here possibly because someone has incriminating photos from his past. I have respect for both these actors and my hope is that they either had a bass boat full of money thrown at them to try and sell this junk or they both were trying to help out some young unknown film students. Either way, it didn't work.",1472256000,2,869,4.403726708074534
