6666995,5,B00NLF27P2,Our toddler loves Tec and we love not having commercials.  It's great having a DVD for the car also.  It would be wonderful if BabyFirst would make more Tec DVD's since there are over 40 episodes and there are only 2 DVD's with 6 total episodes.  3 episodes is a little skim for one DVD and the price tag.  5 stars for the show...not the lack of variety or quantity.,1427500800,6,366,4.185714285714286
