1849828,5,B00008K77S,We really enjoyed this movie which had God in it from the very beginning! We also enjoy westerns in our house & this was a watch again for us! Randy Travis was at his best!,1377734400,3,172,3.942857142857143
1849829,3,B00008K77S,"I am still watching this movie and if it wasn't for liking Eric Roberts & Randy Travis, I'd have changed the channel already. I have enjoyed a couple of nice paint horses in this (although the horse Randy was riding & the one that he was on that reared when he got shot were not the same horse! Hollywood thinks horse people won't notice this. Ha! I also noticed the bit on the little grey Arabian that Eric rode that was not available in the time period of this show at all! Don't think we had Arabian horses here in those days either. And what's with the homemade bareback pad -what, no saddle or was the fact that he was huge on this tiny horse their reason for not putting an actual saddle on her?). I know I sure won't buy this movie!! Also, the love interest of Eric Roberts in the show (Vaughn Taylor, who also plays Randy Travis' wife in the movie), wrote this movie & another so-called western, Any Last Words (which is probably just as zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz as this one). Her husband is in this movie too, Paul Tinder and he doesn't seem to be that great of an actor either. Also. why does Vaughn Taylor have shorter hair one minute (after the bad guy cut it off) & the next minute it's all long & flowing again?? Gee, it's over now & Randy Travis is singing. That's about the only good part of the movie.",1365465600,,1309,4.261044176706827
1849830,4,B00008K77S,"I agree with some reviews, that it was a western without rotten language, sex etc., but still had the true western violence (without being over the top in it's graphics).  When I saw Randy Travis had the main role, I was like ""really? another grade B, cheap western"" but it was a Saturday afternoon, I was alone in the house and saw it listed on netflix.  I have to be honost, that I actually liked it.  Randy Travis was not the greatest actor I have ever seen, but turned in a prety good performance.  The story was pretty good and was well filmed and pretty realistic.  I will buy this from Amazon.  They could have found a better kid for the part....his acting was not very good, but overall, this was a good western throughout and worth watching.  Randy surprised me.  He acts better than he sings. (my personal opinion).",1359590400,,825,4.453333333333333

 But Ernest Borgnine and Randy Travis, fans will like this movie.
 Thats why I bought it",1344643200,,162,3.878787878787879
1849832,2,B00008K77S,Gift for my husband--we're both Randy Travis fans--but this was a waste of a good man's talents. Just couldn't hold our interest enough to complete watching. Trashed it.,1331769600,,169,5.071428571428571
1849833,5,B00008K77S,"The movie was great entertainment in the style of the classic western.  The storyline has a message and delivers it with panache.  It takes a lot of guts to develop a script with any theme at all in today's jaded movie industry.  This movie not only has a theme, but it is a moral theme and it is delivered with power and class.",1120262400,11,328,4.174603174603175
1849834,3,B00008K77S,"This was a great film for grandkids and younger kids. The acting was NOT great but for entertainment it was better than the foul mouth bloody movies that are being made these days. I can agree that Roberts has not played a decent part in any movie I have seen of his and I did wonder HOW the female lead got the part since she was SO bad....must have been a relative.
At less than $5 delivered it was cheaper than rental so I can't fuss!",1087862400,5,437,4.093023255813954
1849835,1,B00008K77S,"As a western buff i almost bought this movie before i saw it, glad i didn't. This is a soap opera western. Eric Roberts i can't believe you said all those mushy lines with a straight face, i hope the pay was good! There are plenty of great westerns at Amazon, just don't bother with this one.",1061337600,4,292,4.140350877192983
1849836,5,B00008K77S,"If you're looking for lots of foul language, sex and violence, this isn't the movie for you.  If you want a suspenseful Western that the entire family can enjoy, The Long Ride Home is a must-have.  Hollywood doesn't turn out too many movies I can give an unqualified recommendation to, but the lack of filth in this film makes it stand apart from the rest.  Kudos to the makers of this movie!",1056758400,16,392,4.416666666666667

7985054,4,B00008K77S,"The Long Ride Home features a list of veteran actors, including the recent country singer cum actor, Randy Travis. Although he doesn't stumble in his role of Jack Fowler/Jack Cole, it is somewhat obvious Travis was getting used to the screen instead of the musical stage. Backed up with the likes of Ernest Borgnine, who has always played a decent cowboy, Eric Roberts (Julia's brother) and even Garry Marshall (producer/writer and Penny's brother), this is a decently acted movie with a good plot.",1470614400,,498,5.0120481927710845

7985061,5,B00008K77S,"THE LONG RIDE HOME

I have always enjoyed westerns but it seems like lately I have not been watching them as much as I used to. So I went into the old movie room and picked out one that I had not seen in a while. I was looking for something not as well known or mainstream so I decided upon this one. The Long Ride Home starring country singer Randy Travis, Eric Roberts, Vaughn Taylor and Ernest Borgnine is a great family friendly film. It is tough to come across a movie these days that does not have cussing or sex in it as a way to make up for other things.

The story follows a man that has been out in the world a long time leaving his wife and son behind. They think he just left but there may have been a reason behind it. He returns home only to find his wife may be getting with another and a son who doesnt know him. Add in that there is trouble coming and you have one good little western.

I have to say that I really did enjoy this movie and also liked that it was a clean film. There was no cussing or sex in it and while I don't mind those things especially when they add to the story I liked that it was not here. This film was written by Vaughn Taylor and Mike Dougherty and I think they did a good job. I wish they would have worked together more to create a few more films, maybe making this into a series of films or something. Taylor has done a few more films but this seems to be Mikes only film he has written.

The film was directed by Robert Marcarelli and I think he did a great job as well along with the writers. Now this is not the most action packed western ever or even the best but it is a good little flick. It stars country singer Randy Travis as the man who comes back and he fits the role well. Eric Roberts is great as always as the wifes new love interest and Ernest Borgnine is always excellent. Now I mentioned writer Vaughn Taylor earlier, well she also stars in this as Traviss wife. She does a great job as well proving to be a good actress as well as writer.

Now like I said this isn't the best flick ever but it is a good one. It is a good clean family film so all can watch it with no worries but it is still entertaining. I would recommend this movie to any western film fan out there. It may not be a classic but it is five star clean entertainment.",1389139200,3,2300,3.958963282937365
