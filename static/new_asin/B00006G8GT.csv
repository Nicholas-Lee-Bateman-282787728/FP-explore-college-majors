8531577,5,B00006G8GT,Two of the most important films of the early 60's. Without these films modern horror would not exist. Even tough they are both black & white the atmosphere just crawls out of the screen. Goerge A. Romero has some of the best shadow work I've seen since Fritz Lang. And Carnival of SOuls is one of the most advanced movies I've seen in a really long time.,1527638400,,354,4.298507462686567
