And a lot of the time the music was so loud it also drowned them out. So I never could figure who was who and what the plot actually was. There was some guy popping in and out like Samantha on Bewitched. I couldn't figure out whether that was the editing either or of he was some weird being and it was supposed to be that way.
So I'm giving 3 stars because if the problem was the DVD I hate to slam the movie.
Also what happened the the private dectective? Was her girlfriend murdered? Never saw anything about any of it after that scene nor what happened to  her and the next thing I see is an The End sign pop up.",1452470400,,762,3.948051948051948
8148903,4,B000J3EZ1I,"I love the fact that this film is shot in black and white and that it is not so easily grasped, it really makes you think.  The story has quite a few flashback scenes to mislead the audience.

I thought for a low budget film it was a good story and the characters were very well defined.  It's fun to watch the race to solve the case between FBI Morgan and Detective Brodski and Harrisburg is the perfect setting for this kind of story.  Pay close attention to the flashback scenes and see if you can figure out how the killer really is.",1176508800,,537,4.184466019417476
8148904,5,B000J3EZ1I,"This film is shot in black and white, the gritty nature of the content

lends well to b/w. I watched it twice and liked it even more the second

time, the film draws you in. Very good for low budget first time full

length movie. Well written suspense/thriller script, use of shadows and

scenery done very well. Musical cues through out the film were well

timed and appropriate to mood and settings, but overall the sound

needed reworked. Actors facial expressions were captured very well,

good use of close ups for personal character reactions. Very good

character acting. Unique story and an interesting setting. I can't

think of a similar story anywhere, very creative and fresh in this time

remakes and sequels.",1166918400,,722,4.844262295081967
8148905,4,B000J3EZ1I,"I just finished watching this movie, and although it stretched the bounds of what I normally tend to watch, the movie was good. If you can get past the nudity and adult situations, then this is actually a good psychological thriller.

(I always love a good mystery!)",1163030400,,266,4.659574468085107
