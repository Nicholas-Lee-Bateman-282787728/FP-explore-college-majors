8292290,4,B001D8TL4E,I enjoyed this documentary on Mario Sperry and the Brazilian Top Team. The quality of this film is top notch on this DVD. Their training routine is very impressive. These MMA fighters work very hard to keep in shape and that's one reason they are champions in the ring all around the world. I recommend this DVD to anyone that is a Mixed Martial Arts fan.,1373414400,,355,4.393939393939394
