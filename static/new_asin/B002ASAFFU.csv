8360328,5,B002ASAFFU,"I could not possibly recommend ART IN THE FACE OF WAR highly enough.

Whether your primary interests revolve around the arts, or basic public interest stories, or stories of WWII, or of veterans, this film is a warm, touching, poignant tale, told of former US soldiers who were official artists during and right after that major conflict, told in their own words, you are bound to be captivated by this lovely film.

All the artists featured are, in many ways, fairly ordinary people, but that makes their wartime stories that much more fascinating.

What is completely extraordinary is their works of art, on prominent display here. Whether the medium is paint, pencil, charcoal, or camera, all of these images remind me, in the best way possible, of the work of Goya, perhaps the ultimate artist of humankind's war against itself. The men in this film were, like most young men in times of war, far from ready to confront the inhumanities they were bound to witness, but their craft and vision as artists perhaps helped them to survive, and definitely helps us to understand history and war just a little bit better.

Creatives, students, historians, educators, and people serving or planning to serve in the armed forces should definitely check this film out. It's smart, tasteful, and very beautiful.

8360329,5,B002ASAFFU,"I have only the highest praise for Art in the Face of War. Who better to teach us about war and about World War II in specific than the soldier-artists / artist-soldiers who fought the battles.
The images: paintings, drawings and photographs these men made - mostly during wartime - are hauntingly poignant, and the spellbinding interviews with the men sharing affecting accounts of their experiences in the war and their thoughts about their lives, their work and being an artist are equally moving and fascinating.
That this is a generation of solders unaccustomed to sharing their every thought and action on some social media platform makes this invitation to view their world all so much more profound and meaningful. There is nothing else like this film. Its an absolute treasure.",1468540800,,786,5.00763358778626
8360330,5,B002ASAFFU,"Things that can't necessarily be said can be expressed, seen and felt through art. The stories and the images created by these veterans - some as embedded journalists and some as regular GIs - are potent, fascinating, and as varied as the men themselves. Art in the Face of War is historically valuable and relevant to the present day. When what we see of war now is generally filtered through an agenda-driven media, this presents a picture worth seeing.",1464134400,,455,4.772151898734177
8360331,5,B002ASAFFU,"This is a great movie. I am a writer about war and war film aficionado, and this film talks about something you rarely hear about, how soldiers captured their war experiences through their art.  To share with anyone who knows anyone who ever fought.  Highly recommended.

8360332,5,B002ASAFFU,"I very much appreciated the thoughts and art of these men. The questions of the interviewer really allowed them to open up and describe their work in a very compelling way. Their memories of what transpired so long ago were contained in that unique moment that remains on the canvas. I've got to say, I was moved by how these artists conveyed with great clarity, directness and emotion their transformation of the pain and suffering of war.",1314057600,2,440,4.7272727272727275
