6042978,4,B00G0RTK4O,"If you like this or not will depend somewhat on why you are watching it. Some documentaries are really for entertainment. This one is really for education. I watched it because we recently put bird feeders in the back yard, among them was a humming bird feeder. The humming birds stopped showing up and I thought perhaps this was because they were seasonal. Sure enough this show confirmed that and educated me on what time of year to put the feeder back out. We'll focus on the finches for now and when they humming birds migrate we'll put the food out for them. If you are really looking to learn a nice basic lesson on these birds, especially for those who plan on feeding them, this is the show to watch.",1466899200,,708,4.412213740458015

The video covers plants for hummingbirds, feeders, migration, behavior, etc.  The best thing about this video is that it features Sheri Williamson, who many consider to be THE hummingbird expert in the US.  If it comes from Sheri, it is factual and you can take it to the bank.",1516060800,,432,4.797297297297297

About the hummingbird migrating route,
How long it takes them to migrate,
About hummingbird feeders,
About the hummingbirds,
The names of the hummingbirds,
And much more! + the video is only 25 minutes, but it says fifty because they repeat the video and the second time there is no talking, just piano music. This is a great video. If you love hummingbirds, then you have to watch this 50 minute video!",1473984000,,651,4.821428571428571

8619993,4,B00G0RTK4O,"Very nice book.  I haven't gone through the entire book yet, but so far,  I'm impressed.  It has a lot of detailed facts and nice color photos. The book is great for anyone  interested in hummingbirds or maybe to promote interest  for someone who isn't very familiar with these miraculous little creatures.  I feed approximately 15 birds daily, and I've already learned more about  their  lives and habits.  I highly recommend  this book.  Just a note :  NEVER put red food coloring in home made sugar water.  : )",1470787200,,513,4.629213483146067
