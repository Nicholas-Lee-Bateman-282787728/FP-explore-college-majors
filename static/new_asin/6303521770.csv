7849099,5,6303521770,Man what ever happened to Steve Pool. This is a great video and really inspired me as a kid. I believe if more kids watched constructive videos as this our society would be in a much better place. This video tells you all about different types of equipment and even to this day I still enjoy watching this video,1383782400,,311,4.288135593220339

for all ages. Kenworth fans will also enjoy the visit to the Kenworth factory and there is coverage of the ""Trucker Buddy"" school program. Highly recommended",1032825600,,223,4.894736842105263
7849101,5,6303521770,"My son Eric and I have watched this tape I bet over 1000 times! We bought our first copy 4 tears ago, and we loved it so much, thati found that  amazon still had these tapes, and ordered 4 more to always have around! I  am 40 and wish that Steve Pool was around when I was growing up!  Tapes sure help direct you and explain all about different jobs(on the job  site) and would be excellent/good/descent and clean for school use! I even  watch them and I am 40 and just love the way Chris Sullivan for HOS BROS.  CONSTRUCTION describes his ""mighty D-8N CAT dozer!  We love all your  tapes, and highly recommend them all for youngsters growing up! Even  adults! lol!",964828800,5,665,4.298387096774194
7849102,4,6303521770,"(This is a review of the ""Heavy Equipment Operator"" tape only).  This is a genuinely educational video - perhaps TOO educational. My 3 year-old doesn't just watch it, he studies it intently while muttering  things like: ""Safety lever down, nothing happens. Safety lever up,  everything happens..."" Heaven help upstate NY if he ever finds a bulldozer  with the keys left in.
Steve Pool, the host, is a little saccharin, but  also a natural with kids and gruff construction men alike. He gets the men  to open up and actually explain what got them interested in their line of  work (""My daddy let me sit between his legs and move some of the  controls..."") Then again, he perhaps gets them to open up a little too much -  after you've co-watched it a few times, you'll be glad you don't have to  share a construction site with the pleasant young bulldozer  operator.
This title is now my boy's favourite earth-mover video, and has  been played at least once a day for weeks now.
Why only 4 stars?  Because  the distributors recorded it in EP mode, thus saving themselves 20 cents  worth of tape, and guaranteeing poor tracking, poor sound, and a worn-out  videotape before your kid tires of it.",963792000,8,1192,4.658653846153846
