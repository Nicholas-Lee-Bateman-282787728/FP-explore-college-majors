8732656,5,B015508FJ2,I've seen these 100s of times but when my 5 year old grandson said he wanted to watch Rooster Cogburn I knew it was time to add these 2 to the collection. Both are great western and I am raising a new generation of cowboys watching them.,1461024000,3,237,4.0638297872340425
8732657,5,B015508FJ2,"This is a great movie. Very well made, well acted, and worthy of the critical acclaim it's gotten over the years. I recently watched The Searchers as well. That movie truly sucked - in SPITE of its critical acclaim - so True Grit turned out to be a true pleasant surprise! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1456790400,,291,4.509433962264151
