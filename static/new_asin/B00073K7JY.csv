2199666,5,B00073K7JY,"Zatoichi is an institution in Japanese film, almost like James Bond or Star Trek films, but with the difference that the same actor has played the main character since the series inception, and with an amazing consistency of quality from the original film in 1962 through the final installment, #26, in 1989.  Shintaro Katsu played many roles in his life, but in the minds of hearts of everyone who loves samurai films he will always be Zatoichi.

This boxset contains seven DVDs, all from the tail end of the Zatoichi series when Katsu had taken over the production duties on the series.  They are all quality films, with ""The Festival of Fire"" and ""Zatoichi meets Yojimbo"" being among the best of the entire run.  Its a great price for seven DVDs as well, which would cost much more if bought individually.

For those starting out with Zatoichi, the films are diverse enough to give a good feel for the flavor of the series.  Funny films and serious films, they all have the charm and appeal that only Shintaro Katsu could bring to the table in a samurai action film.  And this is some seriously cool samurai action.  Katsu was a great actor, and a great swordsman as well.

The films in this collection are:

Zatoichi #16 -  the Outlaw - A complicated story with a vast cast of characters. Directed by Satsuo Yamamoto, who also made the 1968 ghost story ""Botan Doro.""

Zatoichi #20 - Meets Yojimbo - A highly anticipated showdown between Zatoichi and Toshiro Mifune playing his famous Yojimbo character. Directed by acclaimed samurai film master Kihachi Okamoto, best known for ""Sworld of Doom"" and ""Kill!""

Zatoichi #21 - The Festival of Fire - Considered one of the best entries in the series, directed by the original Zatoichi director Kenji Misumi.

Zatoichi #22 - Meets the One-Armed Swordsman - Zatoichi meets his Chinese counterpart, Wang. Directed by Kimiyoshi Yasuda, who also made the original ""100 Monsters: Great Yokai War""

Zatoichi #23 - At Large - A more humorous flick, Zatoichi delivers a baby! Directed by Kazuo Mori, who also made ""The Return of Daimajin.""

Zatoichi #24 - In Desperation - Directed by Shintar Katsu, Zatoichi himself, this is a darker, more disturbing entry.

Zatoichi #25 - Conspiracy - Zatoichi meets his long-lost sister.  A guest appearance by Takashi Shimura of ""Seven Samurai."" Also directed by Kimiyoshi Yasuda.",1158624000,176,2357,4.864661654135339
2199667,5,B00073K7JY,"This guy's acting is beyond this world. The stories and landscapes are incredible. Maybe the film-making technique is a little rusty some times, but in the whole it is effective.",1155859200,5,178,4.966666666666667
2199668,3,B00073K7JY,A well priced collection of the less wonderful story lines.  Zatoichi is always the great blind swordsman but there is less atmosphere and character development in the films included in this collection.,1127174400,13,202,5.3125
2199669,5,B00073K7JY,"I'm probably too biased to review this box set in an appropriate manner.  I've been a huge fan of the series for years.  It would seem to me to be the equivalent of the saturday matinee idea here in the states.  A well-crafted, if not absolutely top shelf, series of films.  I mean this in the kindest sense.  It plays more like an excellent show than, say, a Kurosawa masterpiece.  But each episode is solid, no small feat given that these are the last in a 26 film series.  A major shift from the first films would be the introduction of a bit more gore and sex (hey, it was the late sixties/early seventies).  This may add or detract, depending upon sensibilities.  I dig it.  Highly recommended.",1126483200,27,699,4.433070866141732
2199670,4,B00073K7JY,"OK, this definately looks very promising.  I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.  It was good.  If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better.  I am going to purchase this soon.  Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .

A month ago is when I really learned of this series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.

2199671,5,B00073K7JY,"Zatoichi is great entertainment-and this set collects seven of the best episodes-though I've yet to see any episode that wasn't highly entertaining.  Played by Katsu Shintaro, blind (zato) Ichi is a master swordsman who wanders Japan dispensing justice from his sword which he carries in his walking cane.  Along the way he earns money as an ""Anma"" or ""Masseur"" and as a gambler.
It may sound wierd--but it's top flight entertainment--and historically, the blind in Japan were taught to be masseurs by trade.  There's just a perfect blend of drama, action and comedy in these movies to keep things interesting at all times.  Nowhere near as bloody as movies like ""Lone Wolf""--the fight scenes are very well done--and there's just a little blood and gore thrown in now and then. Katsu Shintaro is just fantastic in this role-and though I also like him as ""Hanzo the Razor""-he plays the role of Zatoichi to perfection.
If you're not familiar with Zatoichi--or if you only know the blond, blind Zatoichi from Takeshi Kitano--give this a try--unless you have a hang up with subtitles--you're sure to be pleased!
The seven movies in this set are ""Zatoichi the Outlaw"", Zatoichi meets Yojimbo"" (with Mifune}, ""Zatoichi meets the One Armed Swordman"", ""Zatoichi at Large"", ""Zatoichi in Desperation"", ""Zatoichi:The Festival of Fire"" and ""Zatoichi's Conspiracy""",1116460800,55,1351,5.155251141552512
2199672,5,B00073K7JY,"I got this collection without having seen a Zatoichi episode before.  I was enthralled right off with Zatoichi, who is not played by Toshiro Mifune by the way, but is played by Shintaro Katsu who is also a superb actor.  Toshiro Mifune appears in the episode ""Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo"" and does an amazing bit of swordplay when it is his character's time of confrontation.

Shintaro Katsu has an amazing ability to draw the audience into the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" in regards to these episodes.  Some viewers may find a few of the scenes (in later episodes) to be shocking or disgusting.  Fortunately, these are very rare, as are the occasional bad actors that remind us that this is not real but show business.  With such things being wonderfully absent in 97 percent of the mix, this collection of DVDs is a great addition to my growing library.  I have mostly Toshiro Mifune movies, and the ""Spaghetti Western"" flavor of this Zatoichi collection fits right in.

 Some might say that Zatoichi is like the Lone Ranger or Eastwood's characters where one comes into a town, and defeats the bad guys with wits and amazing talent, dropping the jaws of the locals.  Being a blind masseuse, Zatoichi has ""super-hearing"" much like the comic-book hero ""DareDevil"" and regularly does amazing feats that are very entertaining and sometimes deliberately humorous.

A really excellent bunch of movies/episodes, so 5 stars is what I give it.",1116115200,76,1438,4.925311203319502
2199673,5,B00073K7JY,"Very nice packaging, the small book with details on each film that comes with it is cool too. Only weird thing was the gold/black/white Zatoichi sticker on the front, and the info sticker on the back, were actually stuck to the plastic wrap on the outside of the box. I was able to peel them off of the plastic and stick them onto the actual box. You could just cut the side of the plastic open and keep it on that way, but you can also do what I did.

The films are in very high quality, the subtitles are very accurate and this is a good set of films to own in one boxed set like this. I would recommend it if you like the Zatoichi films.",1512086400,2,640,4.0
2199674,5,B00073K7JY,It's got all of his movies in this set. Nothing from the tv show. And the are all with English subtitle options. It's the best set available for a zatoichi fan. Since there is no English dub for it.,1511913600,,198,4.102564102564102
2199675,5,B00073K7JY,"A remarkable rendition fitting of the Criterion Collection.  Spotless, clean, clear, and ornately packaged to boot.  I miss the little historical footnotes some other collections have included but take nothing away from this effort.  It can get no better.  Forget streaming HD quality, this is BluRay at its finest.",1503187200,,315,5.36734693877551
2199676,2,B00073K7JY,"I love the packaging and the quality of the film transfers is fantastic. And I've been a fan of the Zatoichi films for years.
So I REALLY want to give this set high marks.

But I can't do that when 2 of the movies are unwatchable.
I saw a couple other people seemed to have this issue, but I'm such a fan that I went ahead and took the chance.
But after going through and checking I can confirm that 2 of the discs in my set have problems.
On disc 5, part 14, Zatoichi's Pilgrimage starts to degrade about 30 minutes in and then locks up entirely.
And on disc 9, part 25, Zatoichi's Conspiracy shows degradation within the first few minutes before locking up.

I tried contacting Criterion to see if they had any suggestions. A few years ago they had a bad batch of discs from a certain factory so they offered free replacement discs if you sent in the broken ones. The Zatoichi set wasn't listed, but I figured I'd ask.
But it's been a week and I haven't even gotten a response from them, so I'm going to have to just return the set.
It's a shame since I really do love the packaging and overall quality. But at the end of the day it's about the movies. And if you can't watch the movies what's the point?",1502928000,4,1206,4.171673819742489

2199682,5,B00073K7JY,"Wow. Nicely packaged, and it's all there. Criterion did a beautiful job restoring the video and sound. I had seen the first 4 movies before I bought the collection, so I had high expectations, and this set delivered. So far I've watched the first 10 movies and enjoyed every one. The story lines are somewhat predictable once you've seen several, but the cinematography, the directing, the acting, and the setting change from movie to movie, so always something new to look for. I still can't believe Shintaro Katsu made 25 movies in the series (all movies are included in this set), plus a TV series (which is not included in this set). I look forward to watching the rest.

I do wish I could have got just DVDs (I don't have a BluRay system), but Criterion (the distribution company) doesn't package them that way any more -- probably not enough demand.

P.S. These are samurai movies. Expect some bloodshed, although that is definitely not the main focus.",1496188800,,958,4.730538922155689

Note that it omits the 1989 Zatoichi The Blind Swordsman and the 2003 Zatoichi remake that does not star Shintaro Katsu. You don't want those anyway. These are the very best of the blind swordsman's adventures. The packaging is beautifully conceived and executed with little vignettes from the movies woven into a wonderful tapestry on the outside of the box. The little hardcover companion book features a spot on essay about the character, an analysis of each movie in the collection along with an original illustration by a different artist inspired by that particular movie and finally the original short story about Zatoichi that inspired the movie series. The amazing voodoo that Criterion used to clean up, sharpen and simply bring these classics to vivid life again will astound you. They have never looked better.

2199707,4,B00073K7JY,"""Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman"" is a box set of 25 movies from 1962-1973 with Shintaro Katsu portraying the lead character of Zatoichi. The films are directed by the likes of Kenji Misumi, Kazuo Mori, Tokuzo Tanaka, as well as others. These films follow the journey of Zatoichi, who is homeless, and travels about the countryside, earning his way either as a masseur, or as a sword for hire. He has almost supernatural abilities to detect things in his environment and this enables him to perform  some rather miraculous acts of swordplay. He is an outsider with a moral code who seeks justice wherever he goes.

These films have been remastered and look great. The box is sturdy enough, and the dvds and blu-rays slip into something like a book with cardboard pouches. The box set is beautifully illustrated, and comes with a book of about 96 pages that has a synopsis of each movie as well as a couple of essays by novelists Geoffrey O'Brien, and Kan Shimozawa. The set also comes with discs that include supplements about the making of the series.",1454716800,,1050,4.73224043715847

2199709,5,B00073K7JY,"This incredible set has all 25 Zatoichi movies in both DVD and Blu-Ray. Why both types? The full set of DVDs or Blu-Rays could have been less expensive, if the consumer were given the option to buy one set or the other, instead of having to pay for both.

As far as the quality of the movies are concerned, the visuals are crisp, bright, and amazing to watch. The details are much clearer than when I saw many of these movies on the IFC (International Film Channel) on Cable TV. It is hard to describe what a wonderful experience it was to watch these films in their chronological order, and to see the gradual evolution of the character of Zatoichi, and some of the other characters that appeared in more than one film. This is an awesome set. 25 DVDs and 25 Blu-Ray discs.

The captions are top-notch, so that they are easy to read but not too large. There is not much else that I can say. If you are a fan of the great Kitsaru and the character of Zatoichi, this set is the ultimate treasure.",1452902400,2,995,4.287234042553192

That said...yes, there are a couple of minor imperfections.  First, the commentary in the little book:

The reader is not terribly well informed by the critiques.  The insights of a good film critic can be enlightening, even when they are negative.  I thought the remarks about the films would be more penetrating and interesting.  Perhaps the idea was to let the viewer draw his own conclusions.

I was surprised to find that my DVD player choked on the Blu Ray version of the seventeenth film (one of my favorites), handing me a gap of about eighteen minutes.  The DVD worked well, so all was not lost.

As a few others have noted, the album containing the discs is clumsy; getting the discs out and back in can be irksome.  I removed all the discs and put them in individual plastic cases.

When I saw some of these films in a theatre, I was much more impressed by the faux swordplay of the hero.  Never mind; the films were fun then, and they are fun today.  I'm pleased, but not overjoyed.",1438128000,,1151,4.573529411764706

You must, MUST do this with Zatoichi unless you understand Japanese AND understand the culture during the era that the character lived.  I know neither so I've seen many of these stories many times and always find an interesting, entertaining, and delightful revelation.  Materially, for instance, I have learned that most if not all have certain intrinsic elements native to the stories:  in each story, there are always, children, music, and animals that have their own role specific to the story - they are part of the spine of the story.  Additionally, there is ample, subtle comedy in every tale of Zatoichi.  Oh!  And the swordfights: it is simply not possible to beat Zatoichi.",1422403200,2,857,4.75

But most of the stories are interesting, some sad, many cause anger and some would make feel like getting in the movie and punching someone. In general is a classic. Not Tom Cruise's Last Samurai or Bronson and Mifune's Red Sun, but more Life is Beautiful. Life usually takes more than it gives but possibilities are endless. And Zatoichi does and teaches that:  he lives and do his best to do justice and live in peace in a kind of utopic Japanese yakuza way.",1421712000,2,742,4.578947368421052

2199769,5,B00073K7JY,"The Zatoichi films dwell in that sweet spot between the high art masterpieces of Akira Kurosawa and the serial westerns of the US.  Some, even in Japan, thought Kurosawa rather pretentious and too keen to adapt Shakespeare and other Western art forms.  The Zatoichi story arcs are of simple people, scoundrels, gamblers, gangsters, damsels (both in distress and treacherous), and the samurai / ronin that inhabit the last decaying period of the shogunate.  Through all this travels a blind masseur, outwardly calm and humble, but with a keen sense of justice and understanding of human nature, particularly that of the many dishonest cretins that afflict the populace.  Sound a bit like Clint Eastwood's Man-with-no-name?  Or Kwai Chang Caine?  This series pre-dates those characters by several years, and these films were so wildly popular in Japan, imitations were inevitable.
  With most of these films clocking in at a brisk 90 minutes, the story lines are uncluttered, the action compact and well-edited, and the fight choreography exceptional.  But none of this would have been enough to sustain the series were it not for the iconic performances by the great Shintaro Katsu as Ichi.  Being a sighted person in real life, his depiction of a blind man is remarkable, never a caricature.  And while we as viewers have to suspend our disbelief as to what this blind man can do in some scenes, the care taken by the actor, directors, and writers never leave us thinking ""no way!"" (at least not completely).  You'll find yourself viewing and reviewing scenes just to marvel at Katsu's timing and decidedly non-athletic athleticism.  He's no six-pack abs hero, but as one ne'er-do-well comments, ""he's pretty quick on his feet for a blind man.""  It's one of the great characters in all filmdom, and by staying in the role for all of the series, I'd like to think Katsu realized this too.
  Much has already been written on the unique swordplay used by Ichi, and whether it works in real life or not, but who cares?  Shintaro Katsu makes it all believable, and more importantly to the viewer, interesting and exciting.  If it's entertainment you're after, this series of films provides it in spades, and after you watch a few, you'll be hooked!",1419638400,3,2243,4.936

Yes, they have the mandatory sword fights (well done, especially for a blind swordsman), pathos, comedy, intrigue, and Shintaro Katsu (star, director, and producer) is excellent and engaging as Zatoichi, the blind outcast, good-guy outlaw, and wandering masseuse.  There are 14 movies in this series and this collection includes 7 of the movies: Zatoichi meets Yojimbo (also starring Toshiro Mifune of ""7 Samurai"" fame), the Outlaw, The Festival of Fire, at Large, In Desperation, Conspiracy, and Meets the One-armed Swordsman.  If you like samurai movies, you will really like this set, if you haven't yet experience them, these will very likely hook you.

2199779,5,B00073K7JY,"Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman released on Criterion Blu-ray gets the highest marks, not just as the best in Samurai-Japanese cinema but for great overall story, character and superb quality of each and every film in the series... I have my favorites but all of the films have great character development, complex plots and memorable characters. I don't actually own the series yet but will first chance I will get when it goes on sale more in November from another source... But very luckily my Public Library System which is extensive I am able to rent the Blu-rays and check it out before buying and I found myself enraptured and charmed by this series eclectic and character driven action-drama that surpasses even James Bond in breath and quality of storytelling in every film... another lengthy movie series - but what makes Zatoichi superior even to Bond is that it delivers all the same fronts - action, adventure, romance, heroes-villains and even comedy but every single Zatoichi film is magnificent unlike Bond.
I was already a fan of Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema with historically set films such as his wonderful Seven Samurai and The Hidden Fortress as well as modern films like Tokyo Pop and Like Someone In Love... It doesn't matter what the country be it America, Japan, France, England, Australia, Sweden or other so long as the films are brilliant with great character - artistic sensibility and endearing and Zatoichi has all of that and more. Zatoichi himself is a charming, sometimes serious, sometimes comedic and complex character that we get to know his subtitles and motivations throughout this series of films which are all great. Master Ichi as he is often affectionately known by is the original traveling cure for moral ailments which was continued in TV shows like Kung Fu and The Incredible Hulk (with Bill Bixby) - the lone always underestimated traveler who holds a secret power and rights the wrongs of society.
Even though I discovered Zatoichi later I am very happy that this idea seems to have originated (in film form anyway) with this character... every film is perfect in plot, story, characterization and in every emotion... the picture quality is perfect as well as Criterion who I have always praised should be awarded by brining this series to such standards of delight because otherwise I may not have even known of it's existence... I am not usually a fan of the samurai genre but I do love Kurosawa's epic masterpieces and I mark The Blind Swordsman series every bit as great as those - a masterpiece of a series unto itself and a jewel of epic proportions all its own. Among my favorite of these films are Zatoichi and the Chest of Gold, Zatoichi's Vengence, Zatoichi's Pilgrimage (which is a wonderful romantic story with Master Ichi at it's core) and Zatoichi's Cane Sword but each film is a treasure and brilliant in this Criterion Collection set. The quality of every film is astounding and the details incredible - the direction of each film is just as great and masterfully cinematic as any today and the characterization, story, excitement and pacing even better... This is really a perfect set and a perfect series of films with a great character at its core that drives everything forward. You care about Zatoichi and each ensemble of characters that he encounters and that's a lot more than most film series being produced today yet this series is technically and artistically every bit as good or better than most films hitting the cinema today. If you're a true film buff, Japanese cinema fan or Criterion collector then this is a MUST HAVE set to own!",1411862400,,3617,4.863857374392221

2199783,5,B00073K7JY,I love these movies. It's basically just a random selection from a larger series.,1410566400,,81,4.857142857142857
2199784,1,B00073K7JY,"The quality of the images on these discs are really amazing and great. It is crystal clear, to the point of looking like a soap operas on some panning scenes. Really wonderful.

The bad thing is the subtitles. One of, if not the main reason I bought this collection was because it said it had ""New English subtitle translations"".  I had already seen every Zatoichi film before with older subtitles. Well these new translations are bad. They are riddled with errors and sometimes just flat out change what the people are saying in the films. I will give a few small examples.

A person in the film will say ""Ichi! so and so..."" But the subtitles will say ""so and so..., Ichi. What I mean is that the person will yell Ichi's name first, and then whatever he said, but the subtitles will have whatever he said written first, then a comma and Ichi's name. This is one of my biggest subtitles pet-peeves, because it is absolutely stupid and unnecessary. I understand that Japanese grammar is ""backwards"" if you will, compared to English, but doing things like that is just overcompensating. If the person says another person's name first, then I want the name to be first in the subtitles. When the name is within a sentence its obviously different, but they switch the order for no reason at all. This is done on many different films in this release.

In the second film a man says ""Take these 25 gold coins for now"" but you can clearly hear him say ryo. Anyone who is buying a Zatoichi box-set knows what a ryo is. Strangely, in the other films in this same release, the word ryo is used. So why do they translate it to gold coins? On the 5th film and others as well, ryo is translated as gold coins. It alternates from film to film whether the subtitles say ryo or gold coins.

Does this mean that the sources of the subtitles were different for each film? I don't know. You would think that Criterion would have hired a translator and things would have been consistent, since they advertise the subtitles as ""New"".

Another example would be you hear Zatoichi say ""But, .... so and so...."" But in the subtitles, there is no But, and its just the sentence.

Another example would be that in more than half of the films they translate yakuza as yakuza, but in many of them they translate it as ""gambler"".

One of the biggest things is how they translate ""-san"". For example many, many people throughout all the films call Zatoichi Ichi-san. But they translate this as Master Ichi. This doesnt even make sense. It should be Mister Ichi. They even contradict themselves by translating other names with -san on them as Miss Saki or Mister So an So. So why is it when someone calls Zatoichi Ichi-san, they translate it as Master Ichi? This is just stupid. They also do this with other names, for example in the 9th film someone talking to an old man name Giju will call him Giju-san, and the subtitles say Master Giju. That is just one small example and it is done with countless names throughout all the films. This is just flat out wrong and the people who did the subtitles know it. There is a pretty big difference between Master and Mister in my opinion.

Another example would be that a person will be talking to their brother or sister, and they will say Nii-san, which means brother, and should be translated as brother, but the subtitles say the persons name. Why? Why not just put what the people are saying in the subtitles? One particular scene comes to mind where a girl's brother is dying and she is yelling ""Brother! Brother!"" as he is dying, but the subtitles say the brother's name instead.

This is even worse when throughout all the films people address Zatoichi as multiple different things, but almost all the time the subtitles say Ichi or Zatoichi or Master Ichi, and the people aren't even saying his name. The also goes for other characters, they will be addressed as ""Sensei"" for example, but the subtitles will always say their names. One scene comes to mind where a woman is calling Zatoichi omae which would be translated as something like ""Honey"" or ""Sweety"" but it just says Ichi's name instead.

Another example will be when people call Zatoichi Anma-san, which would mean Mister Masseur, but the subtitles will just say Mister, or sometimes even will say ""blind man"". The subtitles alternate between blind man or masseur when translating Anma, which makes sense, but I wish they would just stick with one.

The subtitles text itself is also sloppy in places. For example a used where it should be an, and an used where there should be an a.

The things I just mentioned might seem like no big deal, but when you add them all up, it can end up changing the whole mood and feel of a movie. Also, the things I have mentioned are very small compared to the outright wrong translations of sentences. Changing the subtitles to make the movie flow better can destroy the soul of the movie. I was expecting these ""New"" translations to be more literal.

I was under the impression, that since it was 2013 when this was released, that the people at Criterion would realize people have a much better understanding of the ""culture"" and there is no need to dumb down the translations to such an extent. But obviously they didnt. Its even more strange because it varies from film to film. Some of them will be very accurate and on some of them the subtitles are very bad.

I have downloaded and compared the subtitles on older releases of these films, and it seems that while some things actually are improved, many are made even worse and more dumbed down than older releases, which makes no sense. Notice how they don't advertise the subtitles for this release as ""New and Improved"" its just ""New""...

Also when I first put the DVDs in they were playing on a 2.21:1 aspect ratio, which made the picture look like a very thin strip. Luckily I knew it wasn't supposed to look like that and changed the aspect ratio on my TV, but there are some people out there who might not realize that and end up watching all the movies in a scrunched up picture.

Another thing that makes absolutely no sense is that on the DVDs, one DVD will have 2 films on it, and every third DVD has 1 film on it. Why not jut put 2 films on every DVD? What is the point of this?

My experience has disappointed me very much, and it makes me unable to trust Criterion. I would assume that all the other new restored releases by Criterion have subtitles this bad too, so watch out. At the same time, the truth is that these subtitles really are not much worse than subtitles on any other foreign movie, its just that since this release is rather new, and the subtitles are advertised as New, and it is coming from a company known for their high quality releases, I was expecting the subtitles to be better than average, and they weren't.",1409356800,38,6820,4.508502024291498

2199795,5,B00073K7JY,"The Zatoichi (character-name: Masseur-Blind-One) Series represents world-class film-making.  It is not primarily about sword-and-slash, though action fans may like it for that reason, and there's plenty of it when evil needs to be eliminated.  The films involve an ostensibly negligible ""no-man,"" the lowest of the low, a blind masseur and dice-addicted ""gangster,"" who stands against a corrupt world in order to protect innocents, values, and true morality.  Zatoichi's being a ""gangster"" represents the white circle deep inside the ""black"" ""field of Yin. Every episode reveals the central character's deep humility, piety, and self-loathing, and yet still he grits his teeth and advances in his eternal commitment to the deep responsibilities that randomly come his way: abandoned children and infants, deserted and betrayed lovers and spouses, death-by-accident-or-violence-victims, hapless farmers, artisans, and everyday townspeople.

Existential, moral, expert, supernatural, humble, and yes, pious, Zatoichi rights the balance when greed, callousness, inhumanity, unreason, and evil threaten to overwhelm the helpless and the good.

Fans of pure elite-class Japanese cinematography will also be pleased, as the series maintains the highest-quality dedication to striking images, sequences, and compositions.  This collection from Criterion provides the whole series, excluding the TV shows, in both standard DVD format, and Blu-rays. I must echo the comments some have made about defects in the glue in the packaging.  I have experienced three ""sleeve-fails,"" (on my first-time viewing of each disc), where the glue holding the cardboard disc-sleeves together separated, and allowed discs to escape from the lower part of the sleeve, and threatening to drop to the floor.

Second, I've noticed some occasional pixellation in certain shots, such as brightly-lit clouds in a sunny sky.  I expect better digitization and better quality control from the Criterion Collection.  Even so, this is an excellent collection and well worth the price.

On the other hand, the most expensive set I had ever bought was Kubrick's 2011 collection, which was 70 dls at the time. I've only seen 16 of the 25 films this box set contains (which means I'll still have to see the other 9 and find the last Zatoichi film from 1989), but it's already paid back. You'll get an alternative history of Japanese cinema, with some of the characters of the more official history. This is a series of films without the artistic pretentions of Ichikawa or Kurosawa, but still it employed some of the heavyweights of the time, like legendary cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot five or six of these films), composer Akira Ifukube (Ichiro Honda's ""Godzilla"", or Kon ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp""), director/screenwriter Kaneto Shindo, or even actors Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune.
Unlike most Criterion Collection titles, this one falls short of extras, and the juiciest one dedicates too much time to a ""yopparai"" Katsu trying to shoot the missing 26th Zatoichi film, but still, it comprises almost the whole film series, and transfers are superb.

He is a super hero who also takes time out to wash his dirty laundry. He is pure of heart and consorts with whores and thieves.

On my copy immediately after the credits the image appears to have faint vertical lines through it - as if not all pixels are lighting up. This effect continues for about 10 minutes then the film returns to normal. I'm wondering if this is just a glitch on my copy? If so I can hopefully exchange it. But I wanted to check the remaining discs first. Has anyone else experienced any problems?

2199837,5,B00073K7JY,"I had read about this series of movies and when this collection came up I took a chance and am not disappointed.
First the discs themselves, the DVDs are very good (I watched a few to sample the quality) with nice picture and sound.  The BDs are really nice, beautiful picture and clear sound with no discernible background noise. The films are set up in groups of 3, the first 2 discs contain 3 of the films in DVD and the third disc contains all 3 in Blu-ray.  The first 2 films are in black and white and the quality is wonderful (even in the DVDs).  Good blacks and nice shading and contrast.  The third film and those following are in color and it is vibrant in the 13 films I have watched so far.  Criterion's explanation of the idea of selling the films in DVD and BD in the same package and not separately is on their website.  I have notice that there is no increase in the list price of their BDs due to this and I assume it will continue until almost all DVDs players are replaced with BD players.  They did justice to these films in both formats.
There are 25 films from the original series, a 26th was done 16 years after the last one in this group and I do not know why they did not include it but whatever the reason it is not a great loss as it is available on the market.  There was also a TV series that followed these films, done by the same production company, run by the star Shintaro Katsu, that did the last group of films and that is also available on the market.  It would be great if in the future Criterion obtained the rights to the TV episodes and the final film, did restoration, and released them in another box set.
The films are almost like an American TV western series (like The Rebel or Kung Fu) with the same basic plot for each one.  Zatoichi is a blind masseur (who likes to gamble at dice and is a lightning fast swordsman) that travels from town to town and is on the hit list of every Yakuza gang he has ever crossed and eventually has to fight, usually a dozen opponents or MORE at a time and vanquishes them all.  The acting is superb and the photography is wonderful.  These are ""swordplay"" movies with underlying moral stories, not just a slice 'em up action pictures.
I have no quarrel with the packaging.  I always handle the discs carefully from similar packaging and have never had a scratch that cause a playback problem.  The extras are also good and the hard cover booklet is great, the summation and assessment of the series at the beginning is spot on.
Really well done, recommended.
Updated 6/2014. I finished watching the rest of the set awhile back and finally am getting around to adding to my review.  The second 13 films fit my original review, great picture and sound in both formats.  Opinions of the acting and portrayal vary from person to person. The Zatoichi character seems to get a little meaner in some of the later films and there were some that were ""bloody"" where as the others have almost no indication of blood at all.  I do not think I have ever bought such a great set of films in a single package.  If you like this genre this is a MUST for you, you will not be disappointed.",1392681600,3,3153,4.2883642495784144

2199842,4,B00073K7JY,"As many have said this is an amazing set. As usual with Criterion the packing is individual and not as practical as it might be. The box is beautiful but is very oversized and will not fit with your other BD discs. The info sheets are stuck on the outer flimsy plastic security cover and although they can be peeled off with care one then has to decide where to put them. I put mine inside the booklet on the blank black sheets but Criterion might have thought about that and offered a better option. The discs are arranged in DVD DVD BD order so that every third disc is a BD. If you do not want the DVDs this is not so convenient but the folds allow you to easily bypass the DVDs. The paper sleeves are elegant but again not very practical. Some discs are hard to get out, others sink in and must be pushed out from the bottom (as the glue is incomplete). You may need to re-glue some of the pouches. In addition the print on some of the discs is hard to read and they need to be carefully inserted so one can see which is which. I doubt this box will last and I will probably end up re-packing it as I do with most Criterion boxes as they are all unnecessarily thick and waste shelf space.  It would be so nice not to have to do that! Having said that despite the weird and not very practical packing the set is an extraordinary offering and very cheap at the B&N sale.
I have watched the first seven films and the transfers are excellent. Zatoichi is a cult series and I recall watching every release in Hong Kong when they came out where they were very popular! I love them just as much after all these years and am looking forward to watching the rest.
I have now seen them all. I found no faults with any of the BDs, and have not bothered to watch the DVDs. The disc quality in every case was excellent and I rate this as the most enjoyable mega set I have ever purchased. The packing is lovely to look at but not at all practical. The films are of course a blend of formula, humour, light drama and all have superb acting by Katsu Shintaro. Watching him perform sword fights wearing getta was astonishing. I could not imagine footwear less suitable to sword fighting than getta! My only reason to withhold the fifth star is the poorly thought through packing. When it falls to bits I will just find a way to repack it. This really is a set to treasure.",1392163200,2,2360,4.186813186813187

2199844,5,B00073K7JY,"This is a major cinema achievement for which Criterion should be given full credit. For cinema lovers it's hard for me to recall another release of such importance, quality and presentation but I'm sure there have been many.
  It seems to me that the Zatoichi series is a perfect combination of entertainment and art. One may recall the first cinema experiences of serials, cartoons, a western and a Tarzan or possibly The Yearling or The Wizard of Oz, followed by, years later,  the experience of the amazing fifties where one experienced the whole range of the art's possibilities - Fellini, Bergman, Dreyer, et al, and the wish to be educated in the cinema. One felt morally superior to having sat through Persona a few times whilst watching The Red House or 3.10 to Yuma or The Big Heat as some guilty pleasure.
It may be though that John Ford managed as well as any to make films that were sizzling entertainment but had a power, cinematic beauty,  and sometimes thematic resonance that made them special, and watchable again and again. Another was Samuel Fuller. And so it is with the Zatoichi series.
To briefly summarise what's special about the Zatoichi series: high production values; outstanding acting in depth so that even minor roles stand out; convincing mis en scene; brilliant pacing; romance, comedy, poignancy, action, effective narratives,and an absolute pristine clarity of viewing in delicious black and white films then colour films.

I'm sure it was over a decade. Just this year I managed to find the last Zatoichi I was missing, after all that searching and wanting to see complete my collection of the series. And what happens? A week after I finally have all 25 Zatoichi films, Criterion announces they are releasing all of the series on Blu-ray.

Finally, now you won't have to seek Zatoichi out for years to collect all 25 films in the series. Criterion has made it easy for you with the most beautiful Blu-ray set of 2013, with prints better and sharper than the ones I waited years to behold, and packaged elegantly, with all the films placed within a intricately illustrated book-style box that holds the films along with a disc of extras that offers material I did not know even existed after all my diligence in hunting the films down -- plus a wonderfully illustrated and written collector's book that details each film. I should also note this set includes the DVD versions of the Zatoichi films as well as the newly remastered Blu-rays.

This is a set made for collectors and fans. This new collection is a beautiful thing for anyone familiar with the series, especially if you have come to know how consistently well-filmed even the weakest Zatoichi entry is.

You can read indepth on the BluRay set and Zatoichi in my newest Riding Shotgun column up on Comics Bulletin, which  includes a fascinating trailer, photos, and more.  And a Link back to Amazon and to Criterion.

2199854,5,B00073K7JY,"This Criterion collection exceeded my expectations.  As someone new to the blu-ray experience, I never thought I'd see the Zatoichi movies looking so crisp and clean.  The accompanying booklet is quite good: there are summaries (including cast and credit info) on all 25 films in this collection, each one paired with an often evocative illustration done by different artists; an overview essay of the series; and the short story by Shimozawa Kan that first introduced the character of Zatoichi. Bonus features include the 1978 documentary about Katsu Shintaro by John Nathan.  This was of particular interest to me since I had been looking for a copy of it since I had become aware of its existence (when I read Nathan's autobiography published several years ago).  It's a revealing and frank look at Katsushin, warts and all.

Fans of the Zatoichi movies would be well served to get this collection--the improvement in video quality from previous VHS and standard DVD issues is striking and reason enough to purchase this set; when you throw in the booklet, the Katsu documentary, and two video interviews with Nathan and film critic Tony Rayns, plus trailers for all 25 films, you've got quite a terrific package.  If you're not familiar with the Zatoichi films, obtaining this collection would be an opportunity to see one of the two most iconic characters in Japanese cinema history (the other being Atsumi Kiyoshi's Tora-san).  It matters little that Katsu's portrayal of a blind, cane-sword wielding, itinerant masseur follows a familiar template from film to film; it's well worth the time journeying with this unique character and the immensely talented actor who portrayed him.",1388448000,14,1687,5.135036496350365

AND THIS IS IMPORTANT !!!

- the packaging is the worst I have ever seen - I cannot believe that anyone looked at the mock-up of the set when originally proposed and thought that it was a good idea
- at least half the discs were pushed in further than intended and one of the discs had actually worked its way thru the ""page"" and protruded from the bottom of the sleeve
- there is absolutely no way to extract them with handling the playing side of the disc

I ended up taking out all the discs and placing them into old dvd/blu ray cases I was given over the years
that was the only thing I could think to do to keep them in viewable shape

inspect the discs immediately if buying a new set,
and as a warning, I would NEVER consider buying this set used",1388102400,7,866,4.052631578947368
2199858,5,B00073K7JY,"I have only one nagging question about this Criterion release: Why package DVDs on the left of each page and  then a BLU-RAY of the same three movies on the right?! Why does anyone need DVDs who has the BLU-RAY? And if our budgets are stretched by the added cost of a BLU-RAY, why can't we just buy the cheaper DVD? Why both?! I just would like to know the rationale behind what seems insane packaging to me. Thank you for allowing me to gush . . . NOW! to my review! When I learned that Criterion was issuing all of the Zatoichi films, I was overjoyed and exhilarated, but then to have wait for three months for the release was a bummer. But the long wait is over and the enjoyment begins. I have been watching the films in the order of release because I want to see how Shintaro Katsu handles the character of Ichi as he progresses through life and, in fact, ages. In those earliest films he looks so young, but I am amazed that this charismatic, versatile actor had already found Ichi's character in those first ventures. It was in  film clubs in the early 1980s (before videocassettes and DVDs) that I first met Ichi and fell in love with the character and his stories. There was palpable delight in those small venues as we enjoyed his antics, sentimental attachments and, of course, lightning sword-play. ZATOICHI is formula film-making: the plots are mirror-images of each other, the villains are one-dimensional, often the sentimentality becomes cloying -- but I was not bothered by these issues when I was seeing, at best, two Zatoichi films per month, and - happy surprise! - I'm not bothered now when I sometimes watch one each day. I feel the production values are so superior that I get pulled into each episode with the wonderful details of each setting, the fine acting of guest stars and, of course, the wonderful sword-play, as kinetic an experience in cinema as you could hope for. But none of this would matter were it not for Shintaro Katsu: he is a hero who plays his role as if he were an anti-hero, until those final moments when he effortlessly reveals himself to be the Strong Man who defends the helpless against the greedy. I saw a documentary about Shintaro Katsu on PBS many years ago. When it was over, I wished I hadn't seen it, because the man who was Katsu was not Ichi. All of us who identify with a star go through this disillusionment. I prided myself for years that I was never duped by a Hollywood star into confusing the persona with the person. And yet I fell completely under the spell of Katsu-Ichi. That's why I quoted the line from Yeats in my title  because all of us confuse fictional characters and real characters. Why is that? I believe the answer lies in our very genuine human need for exceptional human beings who transcend the ordinary world with its compromises, disillusionments and predictability. I just learned that Shintaro Katsu's older brother, who memorably portrayed base villains in two of earliest Zatoichi films, played the Lone Wolf in that six-film series. I saw those films too back in the 1980s, but I found the violence too extreme and bloody, the character merciless and unrelenting and the stories unrelieved by sentiment and humor. And that brings me back to my delight in this issue of two dozen wonderful Zatoichi films. Ichi is one of the noblest, most admirable, friendliest, wittiest, greatest inventions of world cinema. I know those of us who are his fans will always see the dancer and the dance as one.",1387584000,37,3485,4.608695652173913
2199859,5,B00073K7JY,"As a 40-year fan of the series, really pleased with having a complete set, with crisp and clean sound and picture.  Cardboard sleeves? As others have noted, they're line with plastic, I didn't see any problems with disks.  Not normally a fan of fancy packaging as it takes up shelf space better used (for me) by books, but this set is a work of art.  Beautifully illustrated and designed, pulling out the disks becomes a little bit like a tea ceremony, signaling the start of something special.  As for the plastic wrap, the labels pulled off easily for me -- I just stuck them on the book's endpapers.

For those not familiar with the character and the series, for me it combines themes of crime, class, pride, greed, honor, desire, even occasional romance so that even if the settings and character types remain the same, each story seems take on different shading.  There is a familiarity to the stories, yes, but they have heart, passion.  The rhythm of trust and betrayal creates both suspense and a certain amount of noir fulfillment.

On a purely visual level, the shot compositions are consistently gorgeous, as are the sets. if you're into that sort of thing.

Of course, there's always guys with swords killing each other. But, really, that's the least of it.

So.  Highly recommended, from this writer.  I picked it up from another vendor half-price, so put it on your watch list, look for the inevitable Amazon deal or Criterion special.  Watch the movies, live with them.  they're something special.

This set is one of the most beautiful, thoughtfully-designed, and well-made Blu-Ray/DVD Collector's Set packages I've ever had the luxury of owning. It's a gem. Yes, the discs are all held in cardboard sleeves, but the playing-side of the discs is against a clear, smooth piece of thin plastic, so providing you tease the discs out carefully and don't mistreat the packaging, your discs should remain shiny and spotless for years to come. These are not the same kind of useless cardboard sleeves other manufacturers have used. All of my discs arrived in spotless condition, and I have no doubt they will remain that way, thanks to Criterion's very well thought-out packaging.

This really is a delightful and lovely set, that will take pride of place in any Blu-Ray or DVD collection. Just remember that this set is Region-Locked, so all the DVD's are Region 1, and all of the Blu-Ray's are Region A.

I got a good 20 minutes of enjoyment simply looking at the box, the disk holder (inside and out) etc. Got it on barnesandnoble.com (cyber monday price) but had to review here as I am generally an amazon customer.

2199865,5,B00073K7JY,"At first, I was reluctant about getting this- simply because I already have 15 of the 25 movies here. The ones I already have are the two 4 disc-per, box sets from Image, and the 7-disc from AnimEigo. The quality on those three, (especially the AnimEigo set) are quite good. But for at least three years now, I've been watching the prices of the remaining movies to see if they would come down, or at least if some might end up together, in other box sets at a lower price, but no such luck!

Then, when I saw the release of this collection recently, I couldn't help but groan in frustration! Seeing that it was Criterion, as well, only made it more frustrating! At the time, I believe it was probably around $250 (more or less) here in Canada at Amazon.ca, and at Amazon.com. Then, very recently, I saw the price go down to $159.97 at Amazon.ca and so the set became more and more tempting!

Then I read some favourable reviews here! VERY favourable! (thanks Stephen!) So finally, last week I broke down and ordered it. And the dual format issue? Couldn't care less!! Why? For that price, I would have been happy to buy either the DVDs or Blu-Ray discs, depending on which format I chose. In my case, I still have DVD players, and in fact, at some point I will by a Blu-Ray player (especially since you can get decent ones for less that $80 these days!), but that will come when I also break down, and buy a decent large HD Sony flatscreen whatever. Generally, I believe each of these movies (sold individually) is roughly anywhere from around $17 to $23. Given that, if one were to round it off to about $20 per movie (times 25 movies) that's $500!! And that's before tax! And that's before how much the Blu-Rays would be on top of that! So, I'd say it's not such a bad price!!
Of course, like some of the sets I originally bought, you can save some money here and there, but sometimes it appears that remaining stray box sets get bought up by people who will then offer them for outrageous prices!

So, for $159.97 (will probably go on sale for even less here on Amazon.com at some point) or $199.97- as it is currently on sale for here, it's definitely a great bargain!

Also, there's the Criterion 'touch', and two formats to choose from, plus an attractive hard cover book describing each movie, nice illustrations and descriptions of the restoration and improvement process, etc., and collector box. Cracking open the book even has that strange pleasant smell, not unlike the days of tearing off the plastic, then opening a brand new vinyl album! There are also documentaries and trailers. Odd that it's less in Canada, but that probably means that if you can wait till around just before Christmas or Boxing Day/week, or (if need be) later in the year, I would imagine it'll be even less here on Amazon.com. That's 'if' you can wait!!

VISUAL/AUDIO COMPARISONS TO THE OTHER ZATOICHI RELEASES....

Last night I watched the first movie from the Criterion collection. What can I say- it's 'Criterion'!! Just like the superb Ingmar Bergman on Criterion collection(s) I have, the transfer is gorgeous! And, just to make sure, the moment I finished watching 'The Tale Of Zatoichi' I immediately put the Image version of the same movie in the player, and (though it is still pretty good), the exposure, contrast, definition, sharpness, etc. on the Criterion version is noticeably improved, and the slightly blotchy brightness was gone, as well as the few little scratches and other imperfections. Even the sound was better, and more even, thanks to finely tuned compression, etc.!

As well, instead of large black bars above and below the picture (with the lower one containing the subtitles), the screen is full, and the subtitles sit comfortably and unobtrusively, yet large enough to clearly see at the bottom half of the screen. All in all, it was such a pleasurable experience soaking that great flick in, that I can only imagine how enjoyable it's going to be watching the rest- especially since as has been pointed out- each movie gets progressively better, with regards to quality!!

Regarding the disc storage, yes, it is a little annoying, but you can avoid scratching or marring the discs by pulling them out at a raised angle. This will not hurt the DVD/Blu-Ray discs. These type of discs are quite strong! However, I've already started putting mine in those clear, thin double DVD cases. I could live with keeping them in the original case, but it's just so much easier and quicker to have them in the double DVD cases. Also, just like the absurd 'Alien' box set I bought years ago, I'm not crazy about having to unfold cardboard pages to get at DVD/Blu-Ray discs. (The Alien one folded out about four or five feet wide!!)

If you feel creative (and have a printer), you can always make copies of the outer cover painting sticker, for example, to slip in each case as well as labels. For me, I'll suffice with neat printing, via my magic marker of each title, and whether or not they are DVD or Blu-Ray. But I'll certainly keep the attractive box, including the page inserts within, on display atop a shelf.

Unlike a lot of people, I'm going to take my time watching each one of these- perhaps one per week, with breaks in between- so that I can savour each one! At least- I'm going to 'try' to resist the temptation to watch more than that!

Finally.... There just might be one single Zatoichi movie that you (along with myself) might still have to get. It is not in this, or any other set, and I'm not sure a lot of people are aware of it.
It is, in fact, the 'final' Zatoichi movie from 1989 which is called 'Zatoichi, Darkness is My Ally'. I don't know much about it, but I've read from time to time that it pretty good! Even though it's not going to be as superb in A/V quality as any of these in the Criterion collection, it might still be worth grabbing to complete the collection. Or, maybe Criterion will redo that one someday too!",1386115200,6,5955,4.576923076923077
2199866,4,B00073K7JY,"I can't emphasize enough how amazing these movies look compared to Image Entertainments release. The films look beautiful. You can see throughout the series how film evolved. You can see the utilization of new techniques and styles as you go through the movies. There are minor issues mainly in the subtitles. There are some signs in the movies that are not translated. Typos do occur. The translation seems to be 'Westernized'. I know just enough Japanese to know what was said and what the subtitle says do not match in some cases.  I have made it to movie #16 and I can't stop watching.

If there is anything to be disappointed about, it would be the packaging. Criterion went through all the trouble to bring these films to us and they turn around and ship them in cardboard sleeves. There is not one disc in the package I received that doesn't show a blemish or minor scratch. The discs slide too deep into the sleeve making it a pain to get out. It took me a while to remove the discs since I didn't want to damage them further or get finger prints all over them. I transferred all the discs into a disc binder that better accommodates them. I can only imagine the damage that might be incurred by constantly removing and inserting the disc back in the cardboard sleeve. The packaging and booklet are amazing visually, but it is not made to hold and preserve your discs. The music and movie industry has made a move to cardboard sleeves which is cheaper and more environmentally friendly, but there has to be a better way of utilizing cardboard sleeves that won't damage the discs.",1385856000,25,1587,4.564912280701755
2199867,5,B00073K7JY,"Ok, so I bought this Criterion blue-ray boxset for $200.

I haven't watched it yet. How could I? It's 40,000 hours of content, and I just got it yesterday. Unless I were able to warp space and time, I couldn't have gotten through more than a few movies.

So why am I leaving this review?

Because I'm wondering what is going on in my head.

I love chambara. I love Zatoichi.

But do I love Zatoichi enough to give up eating, sleeping, and working for a few weeks straight, which is how long it would take to watch all of these movies and supplements?

I have a job. A family. Stuff to do. Going on a samurai movie binge would probably make me neglect certain responsibilities, such as parenting. And personal hygiene.

So I've decided that I shouldn't get started watching what (no doubt) are some excellent transfers of classic Japanese action cinema, seminal in storytelling, fight choreography, and cinematography.

Instead, I'm going to review the cardboard box the blu-ray discs came in.

It's a colorful, sturdy box, with nice graphics. A hardcover book with notes about the films is included, which I don't have time to read.

Someday, hopefully before I die, I'll watch some, or perhaps even all, of these movies. But I doubt it.

Until then, I'm happy looking at the sturdy, colorful box sitting on my shelf. Just knowing it is there makes me happy.

Congrats, Criterion, on another terrific release.",1385424000,14,1409,4.706122448979592
2199868,5,B00073K7JY,"Update 3/Dec/2014:

A wonderful thing.  My nephew little Kenny, joined the Marines a year or so back.  Recently he wrecked his knee in some kind of training accident and so has been up lame @Lejoune after an operation getting back into shape.  Apparently there is not much to do some times other than eating, online training, and watching movies.  After getting this set of discs for myself, I had several singles left over from earlier purchases and no idea what to do with them.  But his predicament gave me an out, so I took it and sent the singles to him.  He apparently has matured a great deal (he is certainly no longer the ""little"" Kenny we knew) because of his training, as witnessed by the fact that it took only one episode for him to appreciate the brilliance that is Zatoichi.

Update 5/may/2014:

Wow! this generated more comments than any other post I have made in my many years on Amazon.  To all those who commented (Rattler, Don, HARDEN, Dempsen, Juggernaut, alchartreux, Pearson, oweb2, Buckwald, EYEL1NER) I took your advice and grabbed it on the 1/2 price sale.  What a stress reducer this is.  But now I am saddened that my children do not seem to appreciate what older film has to offer them.  From these films, one cannot beat the beautiful backdrops of Japan or the historical presentation of another culture.  So much here beyond just Zato.

(Ex With many of the old DVDs by Home Vision and Animeigo now unavailable this is a chance for Zatoichi fans to complete their collections-one stop and, on blu-ray as well.

Update: I finally bought the set at a one day sale. My set had no scratches on any of the discs. However, I immediately transferred all of the disks carefully from the original packaging to regular disc cases. I found that it was impossible to get some of the discs out without at least a fingerprint on the data side.

Amazon, there needs to be more warning about this. I've noticed that many PAL DVDs have a warning message about PAL discs included in the product description, but this does not (at least, as I write this).

2199877,5,B00073K7JY,"Zatoichi was a character in a series of 26 Japanese films (released between 1962 and 1989) that starred Shintaro Katsu. If you like Samurai movies, then you will love Zatoichi (even though he is not Samurai, he certainly kills a lot of Samurai with his flashing cane sword). This DVD set includes 7 of the 26 Zatoichi films. This is a really low price for seven movies. Shintaro Katsu was brilliant in these movies.

This film series is set in Feudal Japan. Zatoichi, the main character, is a blind swordsman who wanders the country living hand to mouth by giving massages (Zato can mean masseur or blind man), administering acupuncture, gambling, and singing. In every Zatoichi film, he ends up protecting the weak and defenseless from bullies, gangsters, and scoundrels - - - initially with wit and charm, but inevitably with his flashing cane sword. Ichi routinely manages to kill several dozen heavily-armed Yakuza per film. While Zatoichi may sound like a homicidal maniac, he is really quite charming - - - and you will find yourself cheering for him.

The Zatoichi films totally revolutionized the martial arts film industry in Hong Kong. After the producers and directors in Hong Kong saw the first Zatoichi film, they immediately ramped up the realism of their films.

Thanks to this DVD set and to ""Samurai Saturday"" on the International Film Channel (IFC), I have seen every Zatoichi film except for Zatoichi #14. I was very, very happy when Amazon offered this DVD boxed set, since I had never before seen any of the included movies. All of the Zatoichi films may be watched independently; sometimes, however, references are made to events in earlier films. You do not need to watch any of the earlier films to completely understand and thoroughly enjoy the seven films in this boxed set.

The first two films of the series are in black and white, the rest are in color. All of the films in the DVD set are in color and have excellent English subtitles.

The 26 Zatoichi films (** next to films in this DVD boxed set):
  1. The Tale of Zatoichi, 1962

2199879,3,B00073K7JY,"A good number of these films are produced by the Katsu company owned by the main actor, Katsu Shintaro, after the series had gone through 15 or so previous films. It's as if everyone wrote the films off and he alone took up the remakes, doing it in a different, if unfortunate, style. If you've seen the earlier films, you'll notice the difference immediately: Katsu Shintaro took himself and this character far too seriously and tried to make them into 1970-style art films, obscured camera angles, tight focus, disjointed dialogue, bizarre choice of incongruous music from 1970-style jam-session to shamisen to solo flute. They also kept with the times by mentioning/dealing with prostitution, particularly underaged, and the things of the body, from gastro-intestinal to sex,  and by the frequent use of swear words (I also believe this is the first use in the Zatoichi films of the risible use of the popular sprouting fountain of blood from sword wounds. Previously, all swords in these films had the magical quality of killing on touch almost, blood seen only pooling when the dead dude was laying on the ground). I don't have anything particularly against these modifications, but the story lines took a back seat, far back, and were just a mish-mash. In addition, he tried to make the main character some type of sage/commenter on life and man's perfidy. Both of these traits can be seen in the heavy reliance in these films of people speaking to themselves to explain the situation, how they feel, etc. in order to advance the plot of the film, a very amateur and ineffective move. Oh, yeah, and for some reason they decided that little children, voiced over by bad actors, was a useful device to make Z more empathetic and human and to show how essentially lonely he was, like a cliche picture of a single tree in a wide field...I liked Katsu Shintaro in this role, but he was no director and should have just stuck to the acting. Fame went to his head and he forgot he was acting in a film about an entertainment about an essentially supernatural person/cartoon character.

One caveat: Though the story-line and consistency is equally bad in one of the films, ""Zatoichi meets Yojimbo"", Yojimbo is of course played by Mifune Toshiro, and he's so good he carries the film despite its total lack of continuity. The relationship between the Yojimbo character and Z is the only supporting role in the entire series in which a character other than Z is really developed and seemingly alive, not just some grimacing caricature or evil. Z is more in the scenes, but you could argue that Yojimbo was the main character almost. Even Mifune couldn't give this set more than 3 stars though.",1328054400,6,2689,4.793103448275862

Trouble is, I'm waiting (and hoping) they'll be put into box sets someday as well, but so far it's been a LONG wait! Well, we'll see! Maybe I'll break down, and buy the remaining movies individually- little by little!
About the content..... If you too have the earlier set(s), you'll be pleased that this batch is even better, as far as sound and visual remastering goes! Here, we also start to get a little bit of the more graphic-type violence (along the lines of the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series), as well as the odd breast here and there, in one or two of the movies. If that sort of stuff bothers you, there's not very much of it, although I can think of far more unpleasant things to look at than a pretty Japanese girl in the buff!
In the meantime, I'll wait and see what happens with the other 11 movies.

Within these 7 films their is a lot of repetition with the main character's gambling, innocence, getting in trouble, comical antics.  Zatoichi finds a way to get out of every situation and with finesse and class.  I agree with other reviewers that the quality of video transfer is great and is a must see if you have not seen it yet.  At first I personally was put off a little at the fact he was a blind character, yet this provides much of the character's personality and issues he must deal with.  As others have said this dvd collector's edition is a starter set and you will want to see the rest of the films.. me personally I'd say eventually.. but am happy for now with this set.  It would have been nice to have some closure with this collection, yet it just leaves you wondering what else happens in his others films.. gosh I think he made more than 20 films.

Shintaro, mixes pathos, comedy, strength and compassion, into his Zatoichi role and brings to life a character that you actually are drawn to. The difference between these films and many of the other ""martial arts"" films, by the way I don't really consider this a martial arts film, is that they spend as much time exploring the feelings and relationships of the characters.

Though all of these films seem to follow a similar theme, these viewing have allowed me to understand and relate to the character a bit. I've come to know why this blind swordsman was so extraordinary and much beloved. This Kitano film, while good for what it is, shows none of the essense of what made Zatoichi so special. In this film, he becomes little more than a blind avenger skewering anyone in his path. With very little provacation, I might add.

2199891,5,B00073K7JY,"As others have noted, the Zatoichi movie series is a classic--outstanding and immensely enjoyable. This collection is a good value. The DVD reproduction seems to be first-rate (each movie looks better than I remember seeing it decades ago), and the subtitles are very well done: Not only are the translations good, but they appear below the wide-screen picture rather than on top of the scene. Occasionally there's even a little note displayed above the picture defining a term, such as ""palanquin"" ('kago' in Japanese).

I have one small complaint. Each of the 7 movies is individually shrinkwrapped with 3 of those incredibly annoying antitheft stickers. I paid good money for the collection, so why am I treated like a potential thief and made to waste time every time I open one? That's just plain rude. I could have used Zatoichi's help getting the DVDs open for the first time, and had he decided to pay a call on the packagers, I wouldn't have tried to stop him.

8044507,5,B00073K7JY,"The entire Zatoichi collection is a must have for serious film buffs and this particular Criterion Collection is the best in their entire line-up. Also, Amazon continues a very solid commitment of world-wide quality goods and services.

The only downside for all Zatoichi fans out there, myself included, is that there is no complete collection of the Zatoichi television series or complete seasons on Amazon or anywhere else out there and I've looked for years at least not in English dub or with English subtitles. The closest thing I've found is a used copy of season 2 with Italian subtitles, lol!",1518048000,,601,4.9504950495049505

8044510,5,B00073K7JY,Beautifully packaged collection. There is a book with summaries of each film included. Image quality and sound are good on these discs and they do have English subtitles.,1516838400,,170,5.107142857142857
8044511,5,B00073K7JY,Long time fan of Zatoichi. I was originally afraid upgrading media to Blu Ray would only show how bad original media was in 60s-70s but they've actually done a lot of work to bring up to higher quality. If you watch on large screen you'll see the separation halos from where they cleaned up focus front and background separately and then overlapped them (this is so you get higher quality background showing vs. blurring). But it wasn't enough to detract from Zatoichi-ness (the whole point). Very happy with my holidays with Zatoichi!,1514851200,,535,4.826086956521739
8044512,2,B00073K7JY,Bought this set after hearing very good things from multiple places. Received the set I ordered. Watched the first movie without any problems. Went to watch the second movie. The movie pixelated and locked up my Blu Ray player. Received a replacement from Amazon today. Went to watch the second movie. EXACT SAME PROBLEM. sending it back for a refund. I doubt I will be trying a third time. No use in buying a nice Blu Ray set if the movies won't play. BUYER BEWARE.,1513382400,,466,4.4941176470588236
