8055751,5,B0008ENI8E,This Pay Per View was good but the camera angles were bad because the camera is outside the cage not inside the cage The main event featured Vernon White vs marvin Eastman also it featured Dan Severn Vs Seth Patrezelli But it does not show the best of dan severn at this time he was too old to fight but that fight was good too,1333152000,,327,4.046153846153846
