4833913,1,B005M2AKMO,"Purchased these after reading reviews, I was hoping to get something wholesome for the kids to watch. I watched the  video of Jesus' birth and that was fine.  Then I watched the video of the lonely cobbler, that was fine too.  Then I watched the video of the young prince with the guy whose airplane crash lands - STRANGE.  I can't remember the name of it, but it made me think the guy who wrote this was high at the time.  It was so weird that I threw the DVD away.  If you want something wholesome, don't waste your money here.  I recommend Beatrix Potter instead!",1392422400,,566,4.283018867924528
4833914,4,B005M2AKMO,"In this day of CG I adore this disk for not being CG. There are many different stories and I have not watched them all, but the claymation is great. I had my twin nephew and neice over and showed this to them. They were in awe. I actually had to explain how this was done and point out how amazing the technique was and they were very impressed! Takes a lot to impress now days but they kept saying ""and they moved it over and over??"". For that I give this compilation an A+.",1389139200,2,475,4.010526315789473

4833917,5,B005M2AKMO,"Purchased this collection of Children's stories after watching one at Christmastime. They are wonderfully done, certainly not up to high tech standards of current offerings on Dvd, but they are enjoyable, and personally, I actually preferred that they were done using Claymation. They have a innocent appeal to them, and even my 20 year old son really had a great time watching them. Some of the stories were adapted from Leo Tolstoy, the great Russian Novelist , and they really do make an impact when you are teaching your children some important life lessons. My sister in law , who was visiting one night, actually asked to borrow my copy, but I purchased her one on Amazon, my fave place to shop, online, of course !!!",1361145600,8,723,4.746031746031746
4833918,5,B005M2AKMO,"I found this 10 ""movie"" set at the grocery store - they are not movies despite what the title says, they are shorts. It is fabulous! They are Claymation shorts by the same guy who did the Claymation Christmas Special and the California Raisins - Will Vinton. One is narrated by James Earl Jones and one by Stockard Channing. Two of the stories come from Leo Tolstoy and one is from Charles Dickens. There is a half hour retelling of The Little Prince by Antoine de Sainte-Exupery, which was a little disappointing because the book is so so so so good, how could claymation even come close? I just finished watching The First Christmas, which added little to the Bible story (a good thing) except some warm, wonderful visuals. All for $5. What a find!

The shorts included are:

The Little Prince
The Velveteen Rabbit
The Star Child
God's Trombones
The Chimes
Michael The Visitor
The First Christmas
A Christmas Gift
Rip Van Wrinkle
Martin the Cobbler

Note to Parents - You may wish to view this before allowing your children to view it. While many of the stories have great morals and some are from the Bible, some artistic choices may not be appropirate for all viewers. For example, the Creation story included in the selection called God's Trombones includes images of a naked man. While no important parts - ahem - can be seen, some families may not appreciate the artistic take. Michael the Visitor also includes a naked man, but again, nothing important is revealed. The Little Prince ends in the death of a child. God's Trombones also has a selection about death. But I highly recommend The First Christmas for family viewing. It is worth the price for that selection alone.",1356912000,18,1682,4.694915254237288

4833923,2,B005M2AKMO,"I knew the work was older and did not enjoy some of it, but Martin the Cobbler was the reason I purchased this CD and so made the purchase worthwhile.  The main functional problem is that you are not able to access a Menu to choose which of the collection you want to view and are made to fast forward etc. to arrive at the ""show"" you want to watch.  Can only give two stars for this reason among others.",1420243200,5,404,4.0375
4833924,5,B005M2AKMO,"I have been looking for the Claymation version of ""The Chimes"" for a long time, and to my delight here it is with a large selection of other great Claymation films. There are so many great films in this set - Tolstoy's ""Martin the Cobbler"" is a must-see. The only drawback is the inclusion of ""The Little Prince"". I have always found that story and all adaptions of it to be frighteningly inappropriate, especially for children. Who in their right mind would have written a story about a little boy who commits suicide, and further adding the moral to the story: the little boy was right kill himself because he got to where he wanted to go??",1418083200,,642,4.495726495726496
