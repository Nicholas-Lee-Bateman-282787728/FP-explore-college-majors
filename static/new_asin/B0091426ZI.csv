8533639,5,B0091426ZI,She was a star and legend of her time.  This film shows her forgotten talent. My late father spoke of her in glowing terms. Now I know why. Check it out for yourself. The silent era was a golden age worth viewing.,1453852800,,213,4.071428571428571
8533640,5,B0091426ZI,"This is an OLD silent movie and is surprisingly good.  It is from a very defferent era.  The story is very moving and is set in the first World War. I won't give away the plot.  I think it well worth watching and a welcome addition to my movie collection.  If you like silent movies, Sunrise is another good movie.  Interesting plot; not at all ""key stone cops"".",1419811200,3,362,4.264705882352941
