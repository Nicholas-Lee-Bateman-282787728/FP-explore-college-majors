8682626,4,B00O8STRF4,"In this film the cops are the bad guys and Afghan heroin dealers are the good guys. Priestly (Arin Alldridge) is an East End dirty cop who wants to take down Sirus (Nathanael Wiseman) a bumbling heroin dealer/user. Yes in this film the heroin dealers are are also big time users which makes for some comedic moments. Priestly is doing this for private gain and utilizes the Russian drug dealers to assist. The Russians are equally inept.

The film is not a strong comedy, but has those moments that are funny after you think about it for a second. There is a good amount of action and blood splatter toward the end. Worth a view for British crime fans.
