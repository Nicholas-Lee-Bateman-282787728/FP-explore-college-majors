8236549,5,B000050IMD,"I first stumbled on ths series on public television about ten years ago.  I was captivated by the content and Tom Bodett's wry delivery.  Though ten years old, this series is hardly dated.  It remains a poignant and reverant travelouge and worth the effort to watch it again and again.

The series covers the theme of trails that helped define and develop America.  It covers colonial eastern trails across the county to the western trails up to the Yukon Gold Rush.  The theme has not rally been adequately repeated ever since.  For this reason this series remains the standard.",1171756800,7,579,4.787878787878788
8236550,3,B000050IMD,"Nice video, but the title for this is not correct and misleading.  It has nothing to do with California's mission trail.  I hope this description is corrected so that others aren't potentially dissapointed.",1112140800,2,206,5.212121212121212
8236551,4,B000050IMD,"Indeed Tom Bodet is folksy, and his dry humor is appropriate for this series. There are six tapes in the series, with only one disappointment in the set, which is the Yukon Gold Rush tape.
The Gold rush tape spends to much time in Seattle and Juneau, instead of out on the actual trail and in camp, which gets minimal coverage. That aside, all the other tapes are very good to excellent. Each segment shows how times were then by the use of old photos or illustrations, along with newspaper accounts, and personal diaries of the time, and commentary by a local historian. Then you are shown how these places look now and you can visualize for yourself of what it might have been like to live in those times. With a careful balance between then and now, Tom maintains your interest and keeps things moving along. Very Educational and Interesting.",1087084800,2,845,4.602649006622516
