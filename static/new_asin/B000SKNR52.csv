""And they live happily ever after..."" So many romance stories end like this. School Days, HA! You wish.

I watch the episodes before and this is one anime that I kind of regret watching.
WARNING if you love happy go lucky kids, students in school being silly and everyone having a good time School Days is NOT something for you to watch.

~This anime is romance and a harem (a harem is basically every girl in the anime falling in love with the one male protagonist)
~It's all about Makoto, the main character who has a crush on a girl Kotonoha (some girl whose family is quite wealthy). Then one day Makoto's friend Sekai decides to help him get Kotonoha to notice him. So she starts hanging out with her and tries to indirectly persuade her to talk to Makoto. When the plan actually works out Makoto is grateful and asks Sekai what can he do to repay her. Before she gets on the subway, she kisses him...
 That folks is when EVERYTHING goes downhill. I won't tell you what happens, but close to the end everything is going to get worse. The show is perverted from time to time.
But I really have to warn you the ending is sadistic and cruel. I know I hate lovey dovey romance harems but this, this is just too pessimistic for my taste.

 And trust me, if you read the manga it's the same thing except the ending is different.

The reason why I didn't give this anime a high rating because it's hard to like or even connect with the characters when everyone is a narcissist who sleeps with anyone they can except Kotonoha (she's just a nave idiot)",1365033600,2,1562,4.350515463917525
8205629,1,B000SKNR52,"I have loved Amazon for so long. They have cheap prices for things that cost too much else places. When I saw the price for this and it's only ONE volume I was in shock. And what's worse is all the sellers are from JAPAN! The last time I ordered from another country, the package NEVER came. I LOVE this anime. Ebay doesn't have one copy, Gk world doesn't have it. I beg you Amazon, surely there is a box set version. Just sell that for a fairer price! And this is a popular anime. It's not rare by any means. I just hope the owners of Amazon read this so they can please understand how much Ive been trying to find a box set of this for a fairer price!",1316563200,2,653,3.9923664122137406
8205630,4,B000SKNR52,"I first heard of School Days off of a friend of mine, who told me that it was an interesting show to watch. From the get-go, the show is pretty much exactly what every other high-school romance comedy is. A shy, but cute girl, a boy with no experience around girls, and an idiotic, comic relief friend.
Firstly, I've always been a fan of this particular style on animation, so I thought as far as graphics, they did an outstanding job. There's a few areas later on where I thought they slacked off a bit, but nothing that would detriment from the show itself.
The soundtrack is amazing. This show features a wide variety of music. And they don't just play it at the opening and closing. They'll put on a tune that does a good job of setting the mood whenever there's an important event or something. I've always watched anime with the original Japanese voice actors, so I cannot speak for the English dub, though I felt each character's actor did a very good job.
Now, to the most difficult part, the plot. I'll start of by saying that they did a very good job with it; however, it is not for everyone. Without ruining the show, it gets very dark towards the end and even a little bit disturbing. Yes, it is a love/drama anime, and you can expect those types of things out of it; however, like I've said, it really picks up towards the end (with the last episode being particularly bad).
A lot of people dislike it that way, but I really thought it complemented the environment the show created nicely. And, as you've likely gathered through the title of this review, it is essentially a love story that goes from good to bad to worse to horrible. There are a few times in the story where I felt it got a little too sexual for not being a hentai title, but that, too, goes with the story and helps convey the situation in its own way.
I did enjoy this series, but it is understandable if others don't. It is not for those that are faint of heart or those that like light-hearted school love stories. However, if you're looking for a good romance drama with a dark edge to it, I think you'll find yourself more than pleased with this series.",1271808000,2,2140,4.365914786967418
8205631,2,B000SKNR52,"First off, I'd just like to say that this show is NOT a romance. Anyone who says so really ignores the underlying connotations of the genre. So, running off of that idea, this anime is as much a romance as the classic story of Romeo and Juliet. Sure, there's love involved, but tragedy destroys it and leaves you wishing it were a bit more straight forward about how it was going to treat you.

I knew nothing about the show going in, and watched it with my wife. We enjoy a good love story or light-hearted comedy now and then, and even an occasional drama is great. This show left us both bothered and NOT in the mood to enjoy a quiet evening together. Just keep that in mind if you really want to see it.

Some people like the surprise ending, and I'm usually one who enjoys a good twist at the end of a story, but this show was pretty harsh. Just be aware of that.

If that were all that was wrong with the series, I'd likely have given it a higher rating, but it has some major problems outside of this. The main character, for one, is as inconsistent as they come. He is all innocent and sweet in the first episode, and by the fourth the guy is a perverted jerk who only cares about getting in a girl's pants. I have seen a lot of jerk guys in anime, but this guy had to be one of the HUGEST, most inconsiderate bigots I think I have ever seen on any media type and entertainment style. So, the main character is someone you end up feeling no connection to, because his -member- seems to be the only part of his body that is capable of dictating any type of instruction as to how he should act. While this theme, along with the way he is left at the end of the show may make it seem like the message being given is to avoid doing bad things to other people, there simply is no basis for this. The draw to the final episode, and ultimately the whole series, is shock value and sadism, which may have its place, but just didn't jive well here.

Now, the fanservice in this show goes over the top. Lots of public groping and fondling, Makoto (the jerk I was talking about before) has no real ties or reservations due to being in relationships with girls, and due to this he ends up feeling up any woman who comes his way who doesn't outright resist him. Literally. And when his girlfriend of the week finds out he's fooling around with other girls? She simply forgives him and tries harder to keep his attention. Sickening, really.

As far as the good aspects of the show go, I'd say it has some nice animation, and the storyline didn't drag on too bad.",1271462400,4,2556,4.208163265306123
8205632,5,B000SKNR52,"Really, you have to watch this anime. The content is suspenseful, cruel and sometimes funny. The main characters start off as normal kids, but introduce sexual themes and cruelty; and some heads will roll! You just can't feel nothing but hate for some of the characters and pity for others. It encompasses many emotions, which makes this anime very interesting and intriguing.  Definitely recommended but only to those +13 and up. There are some pretty strong scenes, some that you might get nightmares. Just remember one thing. Be a good person and don't wrong others. Seems to be the theme here. Enjoy!",1236902400,,604,4.921568627450981
8205633,5,B000SKNR52,"I have all the original School Days Episodes from Japan and I have to agree this is a great series. Great story, AMAZING ENDING. I would watch it just for the final episode. Get the uncut version because there are two versions that circulated one edited and another uncut. If you can't get enough try and get the School Days game for Playstation 3. Of course you will need a Japanese PS3 to play, however it has more endings and you can't get enough. I know I couldn't.",1229558400,,469,4.340909090909091
8205634,5,B000SKNR52,"Wow this anime suprised me, I am going to have to say this is by far one of the best animes ive seen in a really long time. At first I thought of this anime about a guy who couldn't keep it in his pants, but as the show progressed it got wicked you'll be in for a surpirsed with the final episode.",1208736000,,297,3.7301587301587302
8205635,4,B000SKNR52,This may be one of the craziest shows I have seen in quite a while.  I basically thought I was in for a typical show about a high school love triangle.  It starts out very cute and innocent and leaves you completely disgusted and in shock at the end.  My jaw dropped to the floor and stayed there with the final episode.,1201737600,6,320,4.129032258064516
