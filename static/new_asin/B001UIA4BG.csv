8343806,4,B001UIA4BG,"Not bad Spanish language, Mexican made entry in the Neutron series.  Neutron (a masked crime fighter) continues to fight the evil Dr. Caronte and his zombiefied killers.  He also has to contend with Guillermo Lezman, a foreign agent who wants what all the bad guys want, some kind of super bomb that a scientist has invented.  Thankfully, this masked crime fighter spares us the pro-wrestling bouts.  Neutron also has a better body than El Santo could ever hope for.  Entertaining and worth getting.  I got the On Screen/Televisa DVD release and the quality is excellent.  Recommended for masked hero fans.",1399766400,2,606,5.0

Looks like in the previous movie someone tried to kill Dr. Caronte (no wonder, he was pure evil!), because here in the beginning we find out he did not die.
He shows up in his secret liar surprising even his assistant, a little guy who apparently needs help to walk, because Dr. Caronte takes his hand and off they go all over the lab back and forth always by the hand... this shocked me. I was sure Dr Caronte was evil, cruel and cold blooded psycho able to make zombies and robots even more dangerous than himself? And here he goes, by the hand of the little assistant all the time... Mh! Something smells fishy here... anyway...
Caronte has, in the brief time between surviving the explosion and getting to the secret Lab, already killed three of the most brilliant scientists so now there's only one left and he will recycle those three bodies to make three killer zombies and go after him. Remember, Caronte, is not only a wrestler, he is a D-O-C-T-O-R.
With a stellar cast: Wolf Rubinskis (NEUTRON), Pinky Sands, July German, Building Wild, Dawn Carnation... Sorry, got carried away... I meant: Rosita Arenas, Julio Aleman, Armando Silvestre...
Watch it, is worth it and there's no problem if you missed the previous movie, there's a little synopsis in the beginning...",1316736000,,1330,4.761904761904762
