6877462,5,B00QQRBLD6,"Another excellent workout from Cathe.  My only disappointment was that I thought that this DVD was going to be mainly upper body.  She includes lower body exercises like lunges, squats and sumo squats while doing upper body.  There is  also some core work.  It's really more of a total body workout.  She also includes her HiiT cardio blasts.  The workout is approximately 45-50 minutes.  What I really love that there are the four different remixes she has on the DVD.  They are anywhere between approximately 25 minutes to one hour.  It gives variety and keeps things interesting.  I love her down to earth attitude.",1431648000,5,618,4.846153846153846
6877463,4,B00QQRBLD6,"Ripped with Hiit Upper Body Circuit by Cathe

A fun workout for upper body and cardio

Cathe has another winner with this workout.  It is a mix of traditional upper body exercises, hiit cardio compound exercises and plyometric blasts.

Workout time: 46:11
Equipment needed:  Dumbbells and a mat.  Cathe uses 8, 10, 12 and 20 pound weights
Workout crew:  Amanda, Brenda, Jai and Kate
Outfits:  Tops are purple, turquoise and fuchsia with black bottoms
Premixes range from 22 to 59 minutes.  Both Bonus Ab routines are also part of this DVD.

Why I enjoyed this workout:

* It's fun and the time flies by.
* It's challenging but not super so.  I felt energized and not exhausted at the end of it.
* I love the mix of weight work, compound weight work and cardio.

Some things to note about this workout:

* Sometimes Cathe works on the beat and sometimes she doesn't. She always tells us what she is doing.  I much prefer workouts that are always on the beat since it inspires me to work harder.  I for the life of me can't figure out why Cathe can't choose music to really match the exercises.  Many other instructors are able to do this.

* It did seem that about half way through the workout, I started losing interest.  Maybe it was because I was tired.  I think it is more likely that I just don't like the music so I ran out of steam.

* There are no modifiers.  Cathe does urge you to listen to your body and go lighter with weights.  She doesn't offer any alternatives to the plyometric moves.  This isn't really a problem for me since I know how to do lower impact alternatives.

I am only giving this workout 4 stars because I don't like working off the beat.  It is still a fun workout.

6877465,5,B00QQRBLD6,"I got the entire Ripped with HiiT series for Christmas, and this was the first workout that I did from the series.  This series has shorter workouts than other Cathe videos, but she doesn't waste any of your time - the exercises are short but effective.  This workout consists of high-intensity cardio blasts sprinkled in among compound moves and muscle isolation moves.  The cardio blasts got my heart rate up nicely, and all of the moves were manageable and easy to do.  You do need some weights (8 lb, 10 lb, 12 lb, and 20 lb) and a mat if you do the bonus ab workouts that are on the DVD.  What I really like is all of the premixes that are available to you - there's a timesaver workout that includes just 5 of the 8 rounds, one where you can do the full workout with the abs, one where you can just do the cardio blasts, one without the cardio blasts...these premixes are what I love the most because they allow you to tailor the workout to what you need to do for the day.  I chose to do the premix that interspersed ab moves from the ab workouts in the middle of the regular workout (because I know that sometimes I ditch the abs after doing a full workout!), and I am feeling every minute of that workout today.  The music is good, Cathe is her usual motivational self, and I felt like I got a great workout in just under an hour.  Definitely worth picking this one up if you're looking for a solid workout with lots of options to customize it for your needs.",1419724800,23,1468,4.236559139784946
8692342,5,B00QQRBLD6,Sound and picture perfect.,1489622400,,26,5.75
8692343,5,B00QQRBLD6,Love all of her workouts.  She works you out hard but you feel great after.,1481673600,,75,4.0
8692344,3,B00QQRBLD6,"I own most of Cathe's DVDs, and this one disappointed me. While it's still a good workout, I can't recommend it as highly as some (most) of her others. First, what I liked

1. Really challenges me, and I can usually keep up with Cathe. I use the same weights that she uses on most of her DVDs, and usually keep up with all her jumping around. This one requires me to rest a couple of times after the more intense cardio intervals.
2. Nice mix of exercises. Like her other HiiT workouts, this one has short bursts of activities so you don't get bored with any single thing. There are a couple of exercises I hate (like the high butt kicks), so I just substitute one of the other interval exercises.
3. Functional movement. There's less isolation work and more compound activity that works, for example, core, arms, shoulders, and legs. I like that the core rotations are mixed throughout as well as in the two bonus ab sections, since I feel like functional core work is more effective than just doing crunches.
4. Decent weight work. Using the weights Cathe recommends, I get a nice burn during the isolation segments. I don't find that the weights do much for the leg work (like marching Sumos or squat presses), but they at least help elevate the heart rate.
5. Good pre-mix selection. There are timesavers, challenges, and ab add-on's. Very good (as per usual for Cathe) for giving you lots of options on one DVD.

Now what I don't like so much:
1. Shoulders are over-worked, other groups under-worked. There are far too many shoulder exercises, many of which don't work other muscle groups. It's not that the weights are too heavy, but that the segments are way off balance. For example, there are only two back exercises, neither of which really works to exhaustion, ditto triceps. Chest is some pushups and seated flies - again not to exhaustion. But shoulders have squat presses, W presses, side lunge woodchop, upright row with snatch, bent arm lat raise, regular lat raise... I end up replacing some of the shoulder work with chest, back, and/or tricep exercises to stay balanced.
2. Production values or poor. These new HiiT workouts seem to have cheaper production values than Cathe's older DVDs. The music overpowers her voice no matter what I do to balance the channels, and the music choices are much less enjoyable than older workouts (yeah, that's a matter of taste). What's worse, the music track is just slightly off from the beat of her movements. If I follow the music, I end up getting off from her action and vice versa. That's mostly when she's actually following the beat. Which leads to the final con...
3. Cathe doesn't follow the music. I'm not sure why the music mixer couldn't slow down or speed up the tracks to let you workout to the beat more than you do. Cathe has to keep saying ""ignore the beat"" or ""work off tempo"" or ""race the beat"" instead of actually using the music like her older workouts do. At least there's a voice-only track so I can turn on Pandora (and thumbs down the tracks that aren't to my taste).

Overall, I pull out this workout occasionally for variety, but I'm disappointed that I bought it.

8692345,5,B00QQRBLD6,"I loved this workout!  I'm an advanced intermediate exerciser but found this to be do-able and with no dread factor.  I prefer moves focusing on the upper body so this fit the bill perfectly; nothing was too much for me but anything that increases metabolically active muscle is fine by me (I think I'll be adjusting the weights as some that Cathe used were either too heavy or light).  I'm not a big fan of HIIT but didn't think the intervals here were overly intense - I appreciate that Cathe gives you a bit of a break between some sets since longer periods of HIIT can be too exerting.  My heart rate was elevated the entire time but I wasn't hitting the pause button (well, I had to once).  I did modify a few higher impact exercises but kept up pretty well and was a sweaty mess at the end.  Another reviewer mentioned calorie burn - I've been doing Flex Train, Super Cuts, Ripped With HIIT One & Two, etc., and burned more calories with THIS DVD than those I listed.  I of course realize that Cathe has workouts that really are challenging so everything has to be taken in context.

I started with a few of Cathe's ICE series DVDs about a month ago and was so impressed with the results that I decided to give her tougher videos a try.  Some are still way too difficult (Afterburn, namely) but I'm amazed at how strong I've become in so little time.  I've  had to raid my boyfriend's weight set since the weights I had that I struggled with are now too easy (I'm doing rows with 25 pounds... never would have thought that was possible!).  I love her cheery personality and the satisfaction of being able to actually complete any routine she puts out!  This probably is a snap for advanced exercisers but I highly recommend it for those whose fitness is improving but not ready for increased impact yet.",1458777600,8,1809,4.429003021148036

8692348,5,B00QQRBLD6,"Really loved this dvd-I did tone down a few of the cardio moves due to my sensitive knees&feet but still got a great sweat on and loved the strength moves-I have rediscovered Cathe workouts after trying several older ones years ago and finding them too long and requiring too much space and ecquipment. I now have about 7 of her newer dvds and 4 of her older ones and have really been hoping to get in amazing shape. I am close in age to Cathe and find that despite healthy eating and daily workouts,just can't get the scale to budge.
