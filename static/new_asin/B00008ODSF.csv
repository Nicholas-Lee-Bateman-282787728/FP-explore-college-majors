1855696,2,B00008ODSF,"My son loves The Wiggles and we have every video, every cd and maybe every toy that has been produced.  But, Wiggle Bay was in my opinion the first FLOP of the series.  So far, The Wiggles have had a recipe for success.  The songs were catchy and most footage was shot in a studio setting.  The Wiggly Safari was my favorite and even though it was not shot in a studio, the formula was intact.  The only departure from the winning recipe was The Wiggles Magical Movie, but it was ok.  Wiggle Bay is shot with movie type film instead of the live film that has been used up until now (except the Wiggly Movie)  I could tell that the change in film made an impression with my son.  He really didn't pay that much attention to Wiggle Bay.  The footage is very short compared with other videos and their is a story to Wiggle Bay like it was meant to be another Wiggle movie.  I was very disppointed with it and really don't recomend it, but if your kids are like mine then no matter how bad they think it is they will want it to keep their Wiggly collection intact.  The Bottom line is this:  I THINK THAT WIGGLE BAY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE WIGGLES TONS OF MONEY WITHOUT THE USUAL OVERHEAD THEY HAVE.  THE DVD IS VERY SHORT COMPARED WITH THE OTHERS AND RATHER BORING.  I EXPECTED MUST MORE FROM THE WIGGLES AND THEIR DEPARTURE FROM THE WINNING FORMULA HAS DISAPPOINTED THIS MOM AND A SUPER WIGGLY FAN (MY SON, JAKE)",1051315200,25,1412,4.239700374531835
1855697,5,B00008ODSF,"First Wiggly Safari came out and it was a little shift of formula: a Wiggles video with a theme and the setting was outdoors (instead of their filming studio with blue screens and cheesey special effects). Now the latest Wiggles project does much the same: outdoor theme (hence the title) no cheesy effects and thank goodness Greg's 5 minute magical act has been removed too. The Wiggles are still lovable and yes your children will still love the songs. Let's face it we buy the videos for the songs and this video has 10 1/2 catchy songs (I'm sorry but Rolliing Down the Sandhill and Running Up the Sandhill are the same song just with different words). The one thing that this video does not have are the children dancers. The dancing is still there but with adults (I guess it is harder to work with children). If you and your kids loved Wiggly Safari then this will be enjoyed by all again. It is a good video but not their best that honor still goes out to either Toot Toot, Yummy Yummy or Wiggle Time. Apparently the theme videos from the Wiggles will continue in the future; the next one will be in outer space.<BR...",1048032000,32,1125,4.466019417475728

1855709,5,B00008ODSF,Always enjoy seeing the Wiggle on TV and this DVD is really great. My grandchildren are having fun watching it.,1390435200,,111,4.6
1855710,5,B00008ODSF,So  happy to find a DVD that my son needed for his collection.  This was a good quality product.  A good buy.,1388793600,,109,3.8636363636363638
1855711,5,B00008ODSF,Got this for my grandson he loves the Wiggles. He has every VHS/DVD/CD and plays them all the time. Was happy to find the VHS of all the ones he likes.,1379980800,,151,3.903225806451613
1855712,5,B00008ODSF,This is one of my favorite classic Wiggles DVD's.. I am a fan of Sam Moran but Greg is great in Wiggles Bay.  My toddler loves this DVD and adults will love the music too.,1377129600,,171,3.8857142857142857
1855713,5,B00008ODSF,"My son loved the Wiggles when he was a toddler, and Mom got hooked on the happy music too! Wiggle Bay is one of my favorite Wiggles DVDs because of the outdoor beach setting, the interesting story line, and the great music. My son still sings along with this DVD even though he is much older now. The Wiggles magic still appeals to him, and I love it too. The happy songs like Wiggle Bay make the stress in my life fade away. Excellent DVD. Highly recommend to Wiggle Fans everywhere!",1366675200,,484,4.329670329670329
1855714,4,B00008ODSF,Our granddaughters enjoy the Wiggles. We had this item on a video. The DVD version allows more flexibility in viewing just parts of the program rather than the whole show when there is not the time or interest to do that. Rhe purchase achieves the purpose for which we made it.,1276646400,,277,4.450980392156863
1855715,5,B00008ODSF,This is our second copy of Wiggle Bay. The first one got lost. My 4 year old and barely 2 year old sons love this one!,1262995200,,118,3.576923076923077

1855717,5,B00008ODSF,"We have this on vhs, but decided to upgrade to a DVD since my boy is wearing it out. He loves the songs and the fact that it has Greg is a big plus. It's cute and different being on the beach. If you and your kid love the old favorites and un-slick production, than this one's a keeper.",1255305600,,286,3.864406779661017
1855728,5,B00008ODSF,This is a fun DVD.  My twin girls enjoy watching it to see the mermaid as well as all the other Wiggle cast.,1243209600,,108,3.6956521739130435
1855729,5,B00008ODSF,"My 1 year old doesn't sit through a short cartoon / tv show, none the less a dvd. BUT she has sat through all 50 mins. of this DVD !! It's filmed by the beach so there is nice scenery too. Highly recommend.",1240358400,,206,3.813953488372093
1855730,5,B00008ODSF,"My 4 year old son (and my whole family) really enjoys this one at the beach...so much nicer than most of the studio ones!  We have at least 12 Wiggles video since my son is such a big fan, and Wiggle Bay is definitely in his top 3.  Fortunately we live very close to the beach, so this has special significance for him.  The songs include:

Wiggle Bay
Danicing in the Sand
C'est Wags, C'est Bon
Dance A Cachuca
Swim Like a Fish
Rolling Down the Sandhills
Rolling Up the Sandhills
Let's Make Some Rosie Tea
Zing Zang Wing Wang Wong
Watch the Waves

1855732,5,B00008ODSF,"The wiggeles for some reason attract the attention of little ones. My oldest granddaughter is 9 now and she loved them . All the wiggles we had were on tapes. They can be played in the extra bedroom on the vcr. But amazon let me order dvd's at a low price to play on the living room dvd player.

Kelsey will watch the wiggies as she calls them over and over again.",1225497600,,364,4.055555555555555
1855733,5,B00008ODSF,It was great having this DVD available at Amazon.  Hard to find in the stores.,1213401600,,78,4.2
1855734,5,B00008ODSF,"I have seen many Wiggles movies with my son. All the way from age 2 on up. I have never enjoyed their typical style of movie, which is mostly located in an indoor studio setting. Overall, my son likes the songs, the characters and the colors. But the indoor studio leaves much to be desired because it, simply, has a more produced feel. And the production is sparse, so it is creatively very non appealing to me personally. My son looses interest after a while as well. The studio is very chaotic and unatural to the scenses--especially when it is produced with the usual Wiggle bad lighting. I know a lot of adults and children just love the Wiggles, no matter where they are. But if you are an outdoor person, Wiggle Bay is the best Wiggles movie out there. Great story line, nice scenery (so the parents can at least enjoy watching, and take a little mini visual beach vacation) and excellent songs. I highly recommend this Wiggles movie for these reasons alone. I can't say enough about the combination of the Wiggles characters located outdoors and with a better storyline than most of their movies. My son loves to sing along, and finds the characters very silly. I do hope the Wiggles plan more of these on-location style movies. Next--Italy! Rome! Greece! Yellowstone! Bali! Switzerland! (can you tell we like to travel!) Have fun watching this one :)",1191974400,11,1359,4.666666666666667
1855735,4,B00008ODSF,The tunes can stick in your head.  Not neccessarily what I want.  But they do like watching it.,1168300800,,95,4.222222222222222
1855736,5,B00008ODSF,"We borrowed this from the library and it will go on my daughter's Christmas list. I thought this was a fun show and loved the location. The songs are fun, the guys are funny, and I am looking forward to seeing it again. I can see myself watching this with my almost 2 year old, and not minding it a bit. I didn't miss that there were not kids, but we have other Wiggles DVDs that do have kids. My husband and I were looking for something that is different than what we already have, and we found it.",1162339200,,499,4.05050505050505
1855737,5,B00008ODSF,"The parallels are uncanny. From the action-packed onslaught on a beach that begins the film to the bittersweet return home at the finale, ""Wiggle Bay"" is a touching homage to Speilberg's masterpiece. From the presence of a tall, dark hero (Greg Wiggle = Tom Hanks) to his motley support crew (Anthony = Tom Sizemore, Murray = Vin Diesel, useless ""Wake Up, Jeff!"" = useless ""I won't carry a gun"" writer guy) to the storyline of a small, close-knit team stranded in a foreign land, searching for the elusive treasure (Matt Damon vs. a golden key) that will enable them to return home, through their unexpected encounters with other visitors (mermaids = German soldiers) and the ultimate knowledge of our heroes' helplessness in the face of unseen, distant powerbrokers (King Neptune = Eisenhower)... ""Wiggle Bay"" serves as a bold and touching reinterpretation of the Best Picture winner through the lens of Australian children's cinema.

(Spielberg didn't include quite as many songs about drinking rosy tea, rolling down the sandhills or swimming like a fish, but I can only presume that oversight will be rectified in a future director's cut of Private Ryan.)

Five stars hardly seems like enough praise. Buy it now, and be touched in a way you've never been touched by Wiggles before.",1153872000,8,1285,5.0
1855738,5,B00008ODSF,"I think Wiggle Bay is the best Wiggles video thus far.  My daughter loves it and it has been a constant in our home for well over a year.  She's now almost 3.

It is set outdoors and the beach scenes are a refreshing change from studio work.  The songs are also favorites and it's cool to hear different tunes like ""Swim Like A Fish"" and ""Dance The Cachinka"".

My daughter wanted to be Magdelana The Mermaid for Halloween this year because she likes this video so much.  So, I was happy to make her a costume.  This video has also given her a great interest in the ocean which spurs many talks on mermaids, whales, dolphins, other things that live in the ocean and boating.

I love The Wiggles and never tire of them.  I am glad Wiggle Bay is a favorite of my daughters because it is my favorite too.",1130803200,3,800,4.2105263157894735
1855739,4,B00008ODSF,"I bought the ""Wiggle Bay"" VHS instead of DVD because it was cheap and I wasn't sure my son would like this one but he loves it and we don't mind watching it either. It's a nice change from the studio set and the same old skits. The beach scene is gorgeous and my son loves all the music & songs....He even watches the talking parts and enjoys the whole video.......it's just a little short in my opinion.

Overall, it's one of his favorite Wiggles videos now...until he gets a new one of course.",1111968000,,495,4.26595744680851
1855740,5,B00008ODSF,"My 7 month old son loves this video!  It's fast paced and has a lot of catchy music, and I think he can stick with it because it's not choppy like the tv show.  The sound of the waves crashing on the beach is very soothing, too.  This is a winner in our house.",1110499200,,260,3.7777777777777777
1855741,3,B00008ODSF,We purchased this DVD for our son and it was an instant favorite as he was a big Wiggles fan at the time.  If your kids like Wiggles go ahead and get it - it will at the very least give you something different to watch!,1106179200,,219,3.760869565217391
1855742,5,B00008ODSF,"This DVD doesn't have much of a plot, but that's okay with us!  THere is a lot of singing, which my son loves!  The songs are peppy, and not annoying at all IMHO.",1104451200,,162,3.878787878787879
1855743,5,B00008ODSF,"This video is really wonderful and one of their best.  My 14-month old daughter loves it and gets so excited whenever we sing the songs to her, even if the video isn't playing.  You can't help sing the songs...they end up burned on your brain!  It's a fun video and I highly recommend it.",1098748800,,288,4.296296296296297
1855744,5,B00008ODSF,"My 2 year old son LOVES this video.  He dances along with the songs, especially ""Swim like a Fish"" & ""Rolling Down the Sandhill"".  Our family has watched the video so many times we know all the songs!  LOVE IT!!",1092528000,,211,4.225
1855745,3,B00008ODSF,"It's hard to articulate what is different about this video, but the songs aren't as catchy, the skits aren't as clever, and generally, the wit and whimsy of other videos (Top of the Tots, Hoop-do-Doo) is lacking.  However, it IS the Wiggles so there are always a catchy song or two, but overall it's rather short and uneven and the Wiggles do much better when they present themselves as a variety show not as musical actors.  Hope this helps!",1084665600,,442,4.582278481012659
1855746,5,B00008ODSF,"On a lovely wiggly holiday, the Wiggles and their friends found a magic shell, a message in a bottle, and even met Magdelana the Mermaid.  The Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy, Henry and Wags learn to ""Dance a Cachuca"" while making friends with Magdelana.
""Dance a Cachuca"" is one of my favorite songs in Wiggle Bay, because Captain Feathersword got to know and love the Mermaid that way.",1073347200,,394,4.880597014925373
1855747,5,B00008ODSF,The Wiggles did it again!  My daughter cannot get enough of this DVD.  The cute and catchy songs are just perfect for little dancers.,1070323200,,133,4.5
1855758,5,B00008ODSF,"Of all the Wiggles videos, my 20 month old nephew just loves Wiggle Bay.  He watches it every day, and holds the box in his hand while its playing.  I'd say that's a rave review!",1067731200,,178,4.057142857142857
1855759,3,B00008ODSF,"We love the Wiggles but this DVD just isn't one of their best.  Most of the songs are just too...*yawn*...slow.  I'd recommend ""Yummy Yummy.""  It has a lot more ""moving"" songs that the kids like to dance to.",1066867200,2,207,4.394736842105263
1855760,5,B00008ODSF,"Wiggle Bay is a splashing, sunny and the yippiest Wiggles movie of (2002), even when this movie included a brand new character-Magdelana the Mermaid who Henry the Octopus introduces to the Wiggles,Wags the Dog, Dorothy the Dinosaur and Captain Feathersword.  One of my favorite songs from Wiggle Bay is ""Dance a Cachuca"" because I liked how the Captain and Magdelana danced together in the water.  I think Captain Feathersword got to know and love the Mermaid best of all.",1066694400,,472,4.962025316455696
1855761,5,B00008ODSF,"You guys who said this movie is horrible are crazzzeeey. *waves hands* I think this is the best video to come out. Why can't see the crazy humor of rolling down the sandhills? Come on, how often do you see 3 grown middle age men roll in the sand together? ( I do mean 3, Greg sat on his butt commanded) Not very often, right? And what about all the bloopers. Sure it's thrown together but it is funny as fruit salad in the rain!",1064534400,,428,4.047058823529412
1855762,5,B00008ODSF,"According to my three year old son who just has to be the biggest Wiggle Fan in Tennessee...""This is the greatest!!!""  I was a bit reluctant to get this video after the Wiggles movie (which even my son disliked). But in all actuality I think this is probably our favorite, even over Toot-Toot!  We have watched Wiggle Bay more times than I can count and I still sit down to watch with the children.  Wiggle Bay is very reminiscent of the old Monkees shows. Hope you enjoy as much as we do!!!",1059523200,,491,4.315217391304348
1855763,5,B00008ODSF,"Great DVD ! The Wiggles put out another great video to their collection.
This is one of my kids favorite Wiggles videos. Great songs and production. Only one disappointment, no children dancers.
Great to see them use one of their adult dancers (Niaomi Wallace) as a new Wiggle friend, ""Magdalena the Mermaid"".
So, sit back and enjoy some rosey tea while you watch this DVD.
This is a must for all Wiggles' fans.",1058659200,,411,4.6438356164383565

1855766,4,B00008ODSF,"Having a 3-year old, my wife and I became instant fans of the wiggles.  Now our daughter is telling us to turn their music down!  After watching them on Disney Channel for a while and buying their CDs, it was time for their videos/DVDs.  The only two that are available on DVD is the Magical Adventure (The Wiggles Movie) and this one, their latest.  Though the former suffers from distancing themselves from their audience by using standard film and story techniques, the later however, includes less story and more ""sing-to-the-camera"" songs.  The Wiggles are bad actors anyway (sorry, guys...) so they should concentrate on doing what they do best - singing and entertaining children.  They are terrific live, too!",1057017600,,717,4.983193277310924
1855767,5,B00008ODSF,"We preordered this on DVD last month, for my daughter's 2nd birthday, and from the second we turned it on she sat as if in a trance!  Once again, the Wiggles have figured out what kids like, and they deliver.
This DVD follows their success with ""Wiggly Safari"", and once again uses the outdoor format.  It has more of a story/plot than their past videos, requiring more dialogue in between songs, which I was afraid would bore or distract my toddler, but she never even blinked once the entire time they were talking-The Wiggles can do no wrong!  The story follows The Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog, and Henry the Octopus, as they visit a deserted island for the afternoon, only to become stranded when Captain Feathersword forgets to tie up the boat.  Of course, they manage to get the boat back before long, but not before finding a magic seashell, meeting a mermaid, and lots of singing and dancing.  They're joined by 4 adult dancers, who spice things up with their antics.  Two of the dancers are from ""Wiggly Safari"", as is Naomi Wallace, who trades in her dancing shoes for fins to play Magdalena the Mermaid.
The songs are charming, catchy, and original, as always.  Every time I hear a new Wiggles song, I think ""Hmm, not the greatest"", but after hearing it two or three more times I always find that I know all of the words, and catch myself humming it in the shower or the car!  Several have a sort of retro/beach music sound to them, such as the 60's surf rock and Beach Boys tunes.
I absolutely recommend this DVD to all Wiggles fans.  Although the look and feel are much different from the TV show, which uses interior sets and digital backgrounds, your little ones will fall in love with this from the moment you turn it on.  And mom and dad might find themselves watching and singing along as well!",1056240000,12,1850,4.545180722891566
1855768,2,B00008ODSF,"We are big Wiggle's fans, but this was a big let down.  The music and the movie is no where near as good as the television shows on the Disney Channel.  I think we will stick with the Disney channel.",1055548800,,199,3.95
1855769,5,B00008ODSF,"What i thought was just another attempt to cash in the market turned out to be a video my kids love to watch. The video is about 45 minutes and for kides this a plenty long enough.
Unlike the Magical Adventure, this release was shortly after the release in Australia, and it was very enjoyable to watch, even my 1 1/2 year daughter can watch it for hours.
I like the story line as it mixes talking with signing and is a break from the usual style of non-stop music. The movie, like the other 2, has a pretty decent plot and the kides seems to follow along.
My kids really enjoy it and as a parent I ound it refreshing to find a kids video which teaches some moral values rather than the obligatory and senseless violence.
Overall another triumph for the Wiggles.",1055116800,9,762,4.298611111111111
1855770,5,B00008ODSF,My 17 month old loves this video.  The songs are great and keep her attention.  She loves Magdeleana the Mermaid and we watch it frequently.  Although Wiggle Time is still her favorite I see a lot of potential in this video taking its place over time.  She is just now getting to the point where she will sit through the talking parts.,1054684800,2,335,4.354838709677419
1855771,4,B00008ODSF,"We have all The Wiggles videos. I find it very nice that they are now coming out on DVD so we bought this one too. I had no idea The Wiggles, a mermaid and 4 adult dancers would be the only people on this DVD though. The landscape is very pretty and the songs are good, so I am still giving it a high rating, besides my 3-year-old seems to love it as much as all the others.
There is a story to this video. The Wiggles find a sea shell and give it to Dorothy and it directs Dorothy to find the golden key. They do a search on the island and find it and give it to the mermaid and Captain Feathersword who take it out to see to find King Neptune. Mostly there is the songs and dancing, but in-between there are a few story lines of this nature making the video more interesting to watch then the standard format. But without any children in it, I find it not up to their normal standard. Fill the beach with kids who swim and dance and it would be a much better film!
All in all there is high energy dancing and singing and playing on the beach, so I recommend it and so does my daughter.",1054684800,7,1087,3.9680365296803655
1855772,4,B00008ODSF,"Some reviews here are unnecessarily harsh re: Wiggle Bay. I think it's the first time these guys have had fun in a while and it shows. Wiggly Safari and Hoop Dee Doo are way over-produced and the guys just don't look like they're having fun. As such, my son (a huge fan) isn't really into either one. Wiggle Bay is fun, energetic, scenic, and original. It's not cluttered up with 50 kids on every set. It focuses on the Wiggles during the dance numbers which is what my kid wants to see. Granted, it's no Yummy Yummy, Wake Up Jeff, etc. but how many good, original scenes can anyone come up with on the same set year after year? Kudos to the Wiggles for having fun again and for entertaining my kid with fun, energetic material!!!",1054425600,,730,4.375
1855773,2,B00008ODSF,"I'll save anyone reading my review the repitious unsatisfactory comments mentioned by other reviewers. I'll just say that I agree with them all. We have at least ten of the Wiggles videos and a few CD's- all are satisfactory or outstanding ( we do not have the theater release one). What a disappointment this new video was for me. But, this is not who the video is intended for is it! So, the $... question is---what did my kids think of it. Well, seeing how they were strapped into their carseats eating McDonalds junk food as they watched this video for the first time they were totally satisfied and not going anywhere! My one child did want to watch it again as soon as it was over and also it was the first thing he requested upon waking from his nap. So, will I be listening to this sickly ""Love Boat"" / ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" cabana type dribble anymore? Chances are, if you give your kids a new Wiggles video, they're going to want to watch it again and again! I'd rather have to wait longer for new Wiggles videos than get bogus, thrown together , cheap-o productions like this one.",1053648000,,1092,4.410891089108911
1855774,5,B00008ODSF,"My children really like this one.  In fact, the oldest declares it the best of all the Wiggles videos.  We have seen the Wiggles live in concert. We also own most of the videos and several cds, so they must know what they are talking about!",1053129600,,240,4.195652173913044
1855775,4,B00008ODSF,"My two and a half year-old stopped watching all The Wiggles videos about three months ago, cold turkey.  I think it was because he might have outgrown the song-after-song format of the old videos, which I think are perfect for 1-2 year olds.  Next came the Magical Adventure that had a storyline but he thought that the Wally character in the movie was ""a little too scary for me"" and refused to watch it.  Two nights ago, we picked up a copy of Wiggle Bay.  He was interested in the beach theme.  Turned it on, and he loved it and has been watching it non-stop since then.
This one is different, a totally new Wiggles.  There are no kids dancing in it.  Only The Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy, Henry, Wags and four Wiggly Dancers along with Magdelena the Mermaid.  The storyline is clear.  He understands it and holds his attention.  The songs, indeed the sound, are *very* different this time.  It's not really like kids' music where you have the obvious big catchy melodies.  It's more of a droning elevator-music like sound.  Parents will recognize their new sound and the dances.  It's almost like 60s do-wop, a combination of The Monkees, Austin Powers and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  My nine-year old dreads it because the lyrics are extremely repetitive along with the music.  I wasn't surprised to see that John Field and Dom Lindsay are in the songwriting credits for almost all of the songs (maybe all of the songs).  I guess The Wiggles are too busy touring and doing business deals now, and have less time to do their real work.  Bottom line: The 2 1/2 year old boy likes it.",1053043200,2,1601,4.597173144876325
1855776,4,B00008ODSF,"Let me start by saying that my daughter and I are HUGE Wiggles fans. She has just about every video and lots of the CD's too. We were very excited to rush home and watch this new video after we bought it, boy what a let down. I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they made this one. Just like another reviewer said it's just so ""forgettable"".
My daughter is 20 months old and the Wiggles TV show and other videos have always held her attention quite easily. But she had little to no interest in this one. I know they were going for an actual story in this video but it just didn't work. All the in between parts where they're talking were so drawn out and boring my little girl had no interest in them. I thought maybe she'd at least like it when the songs came on, nope!! The songs aren't very good at all. They're not catchy enough for little ones, in my opinion. Normally after watching the Wiggles I have one of their songs stuck in my head all day. I couldn't even tell you the name of one song from this video! And the dancing is boring as well, none of the usual fun easy to do steps the kids love. My daughter also noticed that the usual gaggle of kid dancers was missing and was quite upset about that! And another thing that bothered me was that the costumes were the same ones the dancers wore in Wiggly Safari.
If you are a new Wiggles fan and are looking to buy your first video, DON'T buy this one. I would go for any other one, but our favorites are Toot Toot, Yummy Yummy, Hoop Dee Doo, and both Christmas videos.

If you are a longtime Wiggly fan looking to add something new to your collection that's a little different than the normal Wiggly fare I would go for Wiggly Safari. It's quite different from the other videos and shows but still lively enough to hold your little Wiggler's attention.",1052784000,11,1827,4.25
1855777,3,B00008ODSF,"This newest edition from the Wiggles lacks many of the elements that make it a favorite among children.  The most curious is the film footage, and the location.  It feels more like a movie but obviously lacks any storyline such as Wiggly Movie had.  It also lacks any ""good"" dancing and choreography.  My children loved dancing along with Greg & Co. both on televeision and at their concert, however this doesn't offer many memorable moves.  Moreover, the songs are fairly forgettable.  I'm disappointed, and so are my kids!",1052265600,3,524,4.8977272727272725
