8150841,4,B000JJ4WH4,"I'm a big fan of the Negima manga, and found the first four volumes of the anime hugely disappointing.  However, the last two volumes were much better; the writers struck out for themselves, instead of following the manga with just enough pointless changes to ruin it.  This volume includes the climax, centered around Asuna, and is quite enjoyable, even though it has no basis in the manga whatsoever.",1178496000,2,402,4.897058823529412
