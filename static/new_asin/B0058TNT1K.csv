4601516,4,B0058TNT1K,The only disappointment I had with this product is that it did not contain a CD with the DVD so I could put it on my MP3 player and listen at work without the video. The content itself is FANTASTIC!,1329696000,,198,3.975
4601517,5,B0058TNT1K,"I have been to several Thievery Corporation shows and absolute love their music and their shows.  I was wondering when a DVD would come out because the live shows are so great.  Well, this captures the show pretty well, although I will agree with other reviews who say there are too many cuts, but it does not really bother me so it is still 5 stars for me.  What I do find disappointing is the mixing of the sound for the Dolby surround.  The mix places MOST of the music in the center channel speaker, not just the vocals as is should be.  This includes too much of the drums, bass and horns in the center and leaves the front speakers (which are the main speakers on my system and I think in many music lover's systems) to do little more then capturing the surround and echoes.  Unless you have a really high end center channel speaker, the center speaker will be completely overworked and not reproduce the concert feel very well.  This is a shame because a concert DVD had SO much potential to capture the feel of a concert using 5.1 surround (see e.g. Portishead's live DVD).  Note that it sounds great if you just play it in old fashioned stereo, but there was some real missed poential here.",1322092800,4,1199,4.393665158371041
4601518,5,B0058TNT1K,I am a reveliatively new fan of TC (3 years) and was happy to see that they finally game out with a DVD.  I think that the weaving of songs with interviews is great.  It great way to explain the story of what has to be the most unique group I have ever seen.  Well worth having if you are fan and need a TC fix.,1319932800,,311,3.6818181818181817
4601519,3,B0058TNT1K,"Thievery Corporation is an amazing band with an exciting and well crafted live show. However, this video does not really capture it. The problem is the director cuts too quickly between people and keeps the stage incredibly dark, so you rarely have time to watch someone perform - much less see a face. And they have a very large performance group with each person having their own unique talents and style. But you really cannot appreciate it. An example is in the opening, when the two founders of the band are talking about how they met each other. Yet, the camera is flipping between them both rapidly, without showing who is talking! So I have no idea who is who. I guess the director assumed that the viewer would be a fan of the band and know this already. If so, then why even include the material? The most annoying part is that every single edit is done with a blue-white lens flare. After thirty minutes or so it became very annoying and it was all I could see. It's like when you are listening to a speech/talk and the speaker goes ""um"" in between every sentence. After a while, all you notice are the ""um""'s. The same thing happens here. Someone needs to take away lens flare privileges from the director of this video. On the plus side, the short interviews with each performer are well done. They give enough to show you what they are about yet are short enough not to ruin the flow or be annoying on repeat viewing.

Overall, it isn't horrible. I've seen worse concert videos and better (the Faithless live recording is a great example of how to capture a hybrid style band in concert). The music is top notch and the band does a great job of orchestrating the tracks to build up and release energy. And it's cheap, so I still recommend it for Thievery Corporation fans. But it's just not as good as it could have been.",1319846400,6,1835,4.445103857566766
4601520,5,B0058TNT1K,"I've been a big Thievery Corp. fan ever since their mix on the DJ Kicks series. Although I was excited about the new DVD, I understood that it would be difficult to capture the whole Thievery vibe in a concert DVD.

Fortunately, I was wrong.

The music is tight. The visuals are just right. And nothing is lost from the Thievery vibe. It is much better than I expected. Put simply, it's one of the best concert DVDs I've seen!",1315612800,5,426,4.3125
4601521,5,B0058TNT1K,"If you grew up here in the DC Metro / Charm City / NOVA area then maybe you saw THE URBAN VERBS, or TROUBLE FUNK, or MINOR THREAT, or CHUCK BROWN AND THE SOUL SEARCHERS, or DANNY GATTON, or TINY DESK UNIT, or INSECT SURFERS, or BAD BRAINS, or KIX, or TRU FAX & THE INSANIACS, or EU, or THE NIGHTHAWKS, or FUGAZI, at the Atlantis Club, or the Wax Museum, or DC Space, or the Wilson Center, or Louie's Rock City, or the Sylvan Theatre, or Hammerjacks, or the Bijou, or the Ontario Theatre, or opening for some national act out at the Capital Center?

And now we can see THIEVERY CORPORATION Live @ the 9:30 Club.

Wow. This thing is absolutely iridescent. From the opening credit sequence, gliding under the arch over Independance Avenue / South Capital Street, to the final kinetic short circuit of electronica, this show very nearly shimmers and archs itself off the screen and out of your speakers. What a performance. For me it was a slow build, that just explodes wide open - first with the See I infused ""33 Degree"", and then Natalia Clavier's electric take on ""All That We Perceive"". From this point on it's standing-room-only. Golden. And oh yeah, to that person who's going to suggest that it's too bad this isn't in the old F Street location? Nah - remember the pylon that ensured we all had the same obstructed view? The photography here is magnificient. Light Flares indeed.

Song Listing: Mandela, Lebanese Blonde, Until the Morning, Shadow of Ourselves, Liberation Front, Originality, Radio Retaliation, Number's Game, Illumination, La Femme Parallel, 33 Degree, All That We Perceive, Hare Krisna, Exilio, Vampires, Sweet Tides, The Richest Man in Babylon, Assualt on Babylon and Warning Shot. Yeah I know, they don't play everything they ever wrote. Bummer. What's here though sounds magnificient: everyone you want to hear sing (LouLou, Sister Pat, Sleepy Wonder, etc.) in front of everyone you want laying it down (Orrall, Myers, Vyas, Finnell & Mitchell Jr., etc.). The Corporation, Outernational in high voltage.

We've been spoiled for choice over here recently. One Saturday night last month Eric Hilton & Rob Garza, under chandeliers and a star-filled sky, next to the river with glittering jet-liners floating by, brought the whole thing home. With the low-end bass pulsing the opening grooves from ""Web of Deception"" out over the water towards the glowing monument grounds, my wife and I danced in each others arms long into the deepening night. And it was good.

So is this.",1315612800,14,2497,4.852112676056338

8462239,4,B0058TNT1K,"For seeing TC playing live, this is a pretty sweet DVD.

However, I wish there was less video manipulation...the concert is good enough to watch by itself, without graphics being overlaid.  Also, a Blu-Ray option would have been sweet to get better audio out of it.  The bass rocks in this DVD, so I can only imagine the sound quality if it was in a better format.",1361750400,,364,4.402985074626866

8462242,5,B0058TNT1K,"I attended this show.  Awesome show.
DVD is pretty sweet.  Best thing probably short of being there.
Very fun and wonderful  love it.
The good news is that this is NOT a typical ""LIVE"" production with ridiculous noise from audience.  Some people may not like that, but I think it works for my enjoyment.
The sound is awesome and amazing.  The singers voices are probably drowned out a bit compared to live.  Again, that is okay with me but others may not like it.
if you didn't get to go, get this is.
if you want to enjoy Thievery Corporation again and again and live with the sound, lights, and beats.  get it.",1356998400,,612,4.3628318584070795
