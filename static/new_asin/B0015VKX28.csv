8260052,2,B0015VKX28,It reminds me of a 1970's stretching video. Watched it once. Won't likely do so again. I was looking for yoga training that is closers to what I would find at a local class.,1472947200,,173,4.117647058823529
8260053,5,B0015VKX28,"I bought this DVD to get more energy. What I didn't expect was that I'd also get stress relief, relaxing music and a beautiful meditation. I'm a mother of 2 children and really enjoy the time with this DVD. Suzanne Andrews goes at a comfortable pace, and I got a good workout without feeling totally exhausted. Perfect yoga DVD for beginners. I also liked her Beginners Dynamic Yoga DVD as an excellent way to releave stress.

8260054,5,B0015VKX28,"First, I'm a huge yoga advocate. I began doing yoga in my 30's to help with low back pain and sciatica and I've been hooked ever since.

Many people are under the misconception that yoga is just for the young, athletic and/or flexible, so I'm always excited to discover and share information about yoga DVDs that are accessible to beginners or all ages and abilities.  Yoga Chi For Energy by Suzanne Andrews is just such a DVD.

Yoga Chi for Energy combines basic yoga poses with flowing tai chi movements to create a gentle invigorating workout appropriate for beginning exercisers of all ages, sizes, and abilities.  Think of it as `Yoga Light.'

Suzanne Andrews is an occupational therapist and functional fitness expert who lost 60 pounds since beginning to practice yoga. Her practical approach to functional fitness coupled with her sincere desire to help others discover the powerful physical, mental, and emotional benefits of yoga creates a routine to vitalize your body, mind, and spirit.

Set beside a lake, this one-hour program is divided into:

Part 1:  A 7-minute warm-up and breathing exercises to get your blood flowing.

Part 2: A 21 minute rejuvenating workout of standing poses designed to strengthen and tone while improving balance.  This is a total body series incorporating movements for both the upper and lower body.

Part 3: A 13-minute routine of floor exercises to stretch and strengthen your core.

Part 4:  The final segment is an 11 minute relaxing guided meditation set before a fireplace with soothing background music.

Bonuses include a non-narrated 11-minute energizing workout and a 4-minute introduction to the power of laughing yoga.

The pace of this DVD is slow and controlled with lots of expert instruction to keep you safe and motivated.  Modifications for some of the more challenging poses, such as downward facing dog, are demonstrated.  It's a fun, accessible workout appropriate for all ages and abilities that will leave you feeling refreshed, not depleted.

Yoga Chi For Energy helps prove what I believe:  Everyone - not just dancers and athletes - can benefit from practicing yoga - when done in a slow, controlled and safe way.",1329782400,,2182,5.044692737430168
8260055,5,B0015VKX28,"I love stretching and have always found it relaxing.  My husband on the other had has to work at his flexibility. My daughter is young and still carefree.  But understanding and applying yoga techniques to maximize your body's energy is absolutely critical regardless of age, background or current ability.

8260056,5,B0015VKX28,I'm new to yoga and this DVD seems to be an easy start. Suzanne takes time so that it's not difficult to follow her. I'm very comfortable with learning with her.,1239926400,,161,4.225806451612903
8260057,5,B0015VKX28,"This dvd is awesome. She shows you how to do exercises that relieve stress and loosen joints (my major problem). She guides you through the routine, you don't have to feel anxious wondering if you can keep up because she moves at a nice pace. Most importantly she shows you how to ""safely"" follow a routine which is most important to prevent injury. Whether you are just starting out and want a little exercise or you are very athletic this dvd will be one of your top watches. You need to buy it and buy one for your cousin for Christmas too, you will enjoy this!",1238630400,,564,4.330188679245283
8260058,1,B0015VKX28,"Even if you are yoga beginners do not buy this DVD. Bad quality, bad routines, NO sense because you have to smile in every routine. Do not waste your money on this DVD. Dunring one of the routines Mrs. Suzanne Andrews felt down and you can see the lack of concentration during the whole video.  I ordered this DVD by mistake and by the end I was glad it was like that, because I already ask for a refund.",1238371200,,404,4.113924050632911
8260059,5,B0015VKX28,"This DVD is excellent for increasing your energy and toning up your whole body.  I found it really helps to decrease back pain too.  I really like the bonus section that has unguided exercises. Suzanne Andrews demonstrates the bonus exercises by a scenic waterfall to tasteful music and you just follow along.  After I got comfortable to do the exercises without instruction, I did this part and it's only 11 minutes.  11 minutes a day is a great investment to increase your energy and improve your back. My wife is a rehab director and she commented how these exercises are well constructed, safe and that therapists use some of them in therapy.  I read that Suzanne Andrews is a therapy pratitioner, so that makes sense.  Give it a try, it's worth every penny!",1208390400,9,762,4.69172932330827
