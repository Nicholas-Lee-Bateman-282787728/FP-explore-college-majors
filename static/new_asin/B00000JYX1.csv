7913845,5,B00000JYX1,"I grew up less than a mile from the area we called The Block and Kevin Wilmott appropriately titled, Ninth Street. He grew up much closer to it than I did. Several significant differences between he and I are: a) Im 15 years older than Kevin, b) I am white and Kevin is black, c) He is fantastic at movie making and Im hardly good at watching movies.

Ninth Street referred to an area of EAST 9th, about 2 blocks long. There were a number of retail businesses, barber shops, pool halls, beer bars and unique to Kansas back then, private clubs where the laws required you to bring your own bottle. I remember that the BYOB part of the law was mostly ignored on the block.

Ninth Street was not known to be a white friendly place except for the Ft. Riley soldiers when they got paid on the 1st of the month. Then, the object was help them spend their money on booze, sex, drugs, gambling. There was no shortage of any of the vices. The block backed up to the local train depot. A couple days before payday, we (as high school students) used to go there and watch the hookers from KC get off the trains and meet their pimps. Many times on the last day of the month, Big Sam would load his Cadilac with the girls and take them to my dads Ready-to-Wear store and buy them the most passionate nighties they could find. *His store front is very briefly shown in the movie.)

I was very welcome to a haunt there called the Satellite Club (included in the movie). A band I played in booked there sometimes and many times, we would go there for late light jazz jam sessions and play until the sun came up.

While part of this was filmed in JC, a good part of it was filmed in Kansas City without losing attention to any 9th Street detail. He does a fantastic job of capturing the real deal and tells a very unique story I think everyone should see. The whole cast was great. This is not a jazz movie but includes small clips of jazz done by a few of KCs finest current jazz musicians (Joe Cartwright, Angela Hagenbach, Queen Bey)

I hope this helps you to enjoy the movie. Get it quick while supplies last.",1451174400,2,2096,4.243107769423559

This work faithfully represents some of the events in that electric little square-block area which, to some, was almost like another country. A million other stories of that era remain untold.",1342915200,,295,5.020408163265306

THIS WAS MY  DEBUT  IN A  MAJOR  MOTION  PICTURE.  THIS  PRODUCTION  WAS ONLY THE TIP  OF THE  ICEBERG  FOR THIS PRODUCTION TEAM.  LOOK FOR MORE CINEMATIC ACHIEVEMENT  FROM ITS WRITER/DIRECTOR.

7913851,5,B00000JYX1,"Ninth Street is the 5th street of the 60s I grew up knowing. The things I missed the most I found on Ninth Street. Each story stirred memories of similar stories and people I remember.  Many communities had that street with the taxi stand, barber shop, shoe shine parlor, hamburger joint, pool hall, show.....each having it own stories and characters. This movie is very entertaining and will stir a number of emotions.
You can go back home, by way of Ninth Street.
Enjoy.",1002844800,2,472,4.686746987951807
7913852,5,B00000JYX1,"""Ninth Street"" is a real gem. Martin Sheen and Isaac Hayes are featured in Director Kevin Willmott's first feature-length film. The film deals poignantly and humorously with a whole litany of issues----race issues, the Vietnam War, the military/ industrial complex, Christianity, and other hot-button issues.  Kevin Willmott brilliantly recreates life in his hometown of Junction City, Kansas in the late 1960's.  In particular, the movie chronicles life on ""Ninth Street,"" a notorious street known as ""the Harlem of Kansas.""  This strip of black-owned taverns, pool halls and other businesses was wildly popular with G.I.'s at local Fort Riley. Soldiers around the world knew about life on Ninth Street.  The plot revolves around  on ongoing dialogue of two old-timers----Bebo and Hudie---who lament the fact that Ninth Street has declined from it's glory days when they were young G.I.'s.  This movie will make you laugh and make you cry.  It has layer after layer of symbolism and meaning.  In the spirit of pioneer black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, Kevin Willmott portrays the lives of African-Americans with honesty and passion.  Although the buildings on Ninth Street have been razed and are now only a memory, Willmott has preserved this unique time and place in a funny yet deeply serious film.",997574400,6,1300,5.271844660194175
7913853,5,B00000JYX1,"""Ninth Street"" has Issac Hayes' classic song ""Soulville"" written all over it.  I often expected to hear ""Soulville"" on the soundtrack, but there was no need as the blues  in this movie are the real sounds of soulville, USA.  ""Ninth  Street"" is an excellent movie for anyone who enjoys a real-life movie.  It's a dose of reality with a sense of humor.  A number of the lines  passed between the two main characters, Bebo and Huddie, are not just  funny, but quite profound.  It is a loss to the American public that the  movie industry did not deem this film worthy of distribution.  I only hope  more people hear about this movie and either rent it or buy it.",944438400,3,659,4.445378151260504
