201275,5,1608618897,"A beautiful film about the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  It shows Joseph Smith as a human, the circumstances, good and ill, of the translation and printing of the Book of Mormon.  Is everything included?  No, that would take a movie 4 to 5 times as long.  But it does a good job covering what it does cover.  Worth seeing for anyone who wants to know how it got started.",1394064000,4,401,4.223684210526316

201277,5,1608618897,This is one of the better portrayals of the Story of the Golden Plates that I have seen.  I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.,1368921600,4,133,4.115384615384615
201278,5,1608618897,"This movie spans the time from right before Joseph's marriage to Emma to the completion of the translation of the Book of Mormon. R Dustin Harding plays Joseph (the same actor as from The Restoration - young Joseph). He is grown up now and does an absolutely phenomenal job (he even has a proper 19th century haircut)!! The cast is young (not 32-year-olds playing 21 year olds). This lends incredible credibility to the story. It is an imperfect yet earnest Joseph we see, a young man growing in his calling. His courtship of Emma and rejection by Isaac Hale as proper suitor stands out in the movie, the death of their firstborn child - it is striking how much more real these seem when young actors portray Emma and Joseph, and many of the other young men who helped in the restoration. It also brings out Martin Harris' immesurable contribution to the restoration - as an older wealthier man - who took Joseph's lead (a much younger man). True, he was party to the lost manuscript, but it is Martin Harris we can thank for the Book of Mormon printing. Anyway, I can recommend this movie to any and all who would like to add a well-filmed and acted Joseph Smith movie to their collection. It is easily one of my favorites, especially thanks to Mr. Harding's acting. Well worth the price to buy and own.",1333843200,14,1304,4.529661016949152
201279,4,1608618897,"Knowing productions like this are necessarily made with a low budget in most cases, given the limited audience, I bought this with some trepidation. My family could tell you that I'm a pretty picky movie critic, even when a film depicts subjects I care a lot about. While this production won't measure up to films that cost much more money to make, I was very pleasantly surprised. Our family just finished watching Joseph Smith: Plates of Gold, a feature length film about Joseph's experience of preparing to receive the plates, getting them, hiding them, translating them and printing the Book of Mormon. It focuses a lot on his relationship with Emma too. The actor playing Joseph is the same that played him a few years ago in the video the Church made about his first vision called The Restoration (so now he's appropriately a bit older). It's very well made and even held my teenagers' attention. It's perhaps not quite as excellent as The Work and the Glory series of movies, but better in my opinion than Emma: My Story and even the movie by the Church called Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration. The big advantage it has over all these is that it's extremely accurate historically. Pretty much all the story elements, even minor things, are documented history, but it usually feels more like an engaging story than dry history. It feels perhaps a bit like a good Masterpiece Theater or BBC drama, except that perhaps the actors aren't quite as accomplished, but they're better than average and are quite adequate. The cinematography is terrific. For someone with no knowledge of Joseph Smith or Mormonism, this movie provides a very good visual summary of the early events. My teens were asking lots of questions about Joseph's experiences that they never knew about before. One thing I really appreciated was that the characters, at least all the major ones, felt like real people in real situations (even my kids remarked about that), unlike many of these re-creations of church history. Many scenes of this movie would be good for use in the classroom. The movie indicates it's part one of an anticipated series, so I encourage you to buy it and support these filmmakers so they might continue their work.",1327363200,22,2222,4.834645669291339
7800332,5,1608618897,"The only problem I have with this, is the portrayal of Joseph Smith translating without looking at the plates. Maybe I misunderstood and he was getting a revelation and it was being written down, later becoming the Doctrine and Covenants.?? He was always using a translating tool, called seer stones or Urim and Thumum. Go to momon dot org for an explanation of how it was translated.

(Amazon.. This is a qualified purchase. Others have written a review of this. This DVD did not cost $50!)",1501632000,,491,4.709302325581396
7800333,4,1608618897,Received the DVD promptly.  The characters play their parts well.  Some of the stories associated with the historical accounts have had some liberty taken with the actual facts as I understand them.  However for the most part the movie portrays the great gift from heaven of the restoration of the gospel in the latter days.  A promise that was made long ago to the scattered tribes of Israel. By the way I am not a Utah Mormon.,1490400000,,428,4.51948051948052
