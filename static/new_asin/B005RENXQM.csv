4861062,4,B005RENXQM,"The film gets the 4 stars.  The presentation gets 0.  The print is very watchable if nothing gorgeous, but for a pricey DVD like this you at least think they could put in some chapter stops!!
Tip: To thoroughly appreciate this film, see if you can find Universal's DESTINY. The last part of that film was cut from FLESH AND FANTASY and it's inclusion here in it's proper edit would have made FLESH AND FANTASY a classic.
Hint: The mysterious body in the river at the start of this film is the tail end of the amazing DESTINY outtake footage.",1408752000,,541,4.4

4861064,5,B005RENXQM,"Leave it to Universal to dvd-r a classic film that deserves a Blu-ray release. This was, unless I'm badly mistaken, the first multi-story fantasy feature, beating out the justly famous DEAD OF NIGHT by several years. Only the third story is weak, letting the overall affair down a bit. The picture quality is liveable but should have been perfect, but then when has Universal been able to spell restoration?",1382140800,13,407,4.913043478260869
4861065,4,B005RENXQM,"I have been waiting quite a while for the release of 1943's FLESH AND FANTASY. The concept holding the film together is rather weak but the three stories are interesting. The third story with Barbara Stanwyck and Charles Boyer is a bit confusing. Why is she a wanted woman? Was it a dream? Makes no sense. The first story with Betty Field as an ugly woman who wears a mask and eventually finds her true beauty is rather moving. What a wonderful story. The second story is the showcase. Edward G. Robinson is told by a psychic that he will murder someone. Will he? Enough said. Tune in yourselves. Great story. Overall I would recommend this rare film. I've been noticing that Amazon is discontinuing most of the Universal Vault Series, so get this classic before it becomes unavailable.",1381536000,10,786,4.661870503597123
4861066,2,B005RENXQM,"I have the PAL release of the film (PAL meaning it's sped up to 25 fps, thus a shorter runtime - 89 minutes - and slightly higher pitched audio). I bought the Universal Vault MOD dvd because the Amazon description here indicates the correct film runtime of 94 minutes. I assumed it was a normal film copy.
However, turns out it's the same runtime as the PAL (the Vault dvd insert rounds it up to 90 minutes), and same audio. I confirmed with software that they telecined the PAL video so it would play on USA dvd players. The video is less sharp than the PAL dvd, but you wouldnt know unless you had the PAL dvd to compare.
This is unfortunately not an unusual practice. DVD company VCI frequently releases UK films in USA in this manner instead of using a normal 24 fps film source. This is a real disservice to dvd customers who are often diehard movie collectors who want the real thing. I emailed them a polite inquiry but never got a reply. But anyway.

Many won't notice the slightly higher pitched voices, or will quickly get accustomed to it while watching. And will erroneously assume the average picture quality is just a limitation of the original negative or print. However, I'll be returning it rather than hear the actors speak with an odd pitch; having restored the PAL dvd to film speed, I know how the audio should sound. See the youtube clip below for a quick comparison.

8484225,5,B005RENXQM,"5 Stars for the movie. 0 stars for it being a VOD from Universal Home Video. This is the major Hollywood studios' way of saying ""We don't think many people will want these old titles in this day and age, but for those who do, we invite you into our vaults by producing these discs as they are purchased, rather than make an actual full-scale DVD release with extras""

What you have here is nothing but bare-bones VOD releases. Universal, WB, MGM and the rest can KEEP their bare-bones VOD releases. I'm happy with my international DVD releases that come with extras.

I'm surprised Universal didn't put ""Destiny"" out to follow this as it was originally supposed to be part of the ""FLESH AND FANTASY"" anthology but became it's own film. I have a nice bootleg copy of ""Destiny"" on VHS from a private collector who has the 16mm film print. Awesome movie.",1485216000,,851,4.555555555555555

8484227,4,B005RENXQM,"While, in general, this is a good transfer of a good release print, there has been no effort to restore the picture or soundtrack.  Scratches and defects have been transferred without any attempt to clean them up.  It is not enough to be annoying, although the credit music sounds rather bad. There are many good things in this film for those who are willing to tolerate it's Twilight Zone-type stories, and a frame story that is neither funny nor ironic (in fact, a waste of time).  Its importance lies not so much in the fact that this is Duvivier's first English film.  The remarkable cast is rather atypical for a Universal release.  What struck me most was the brilliant, noirish cinematography of Stanley Cortez and Paul Ivano, as clearly deep-focused as anything by Gregg Toland.  The score, by Alexandre Tansman, an important composer, is unusual for a studio that was overly reliant on Hans Salter; Tansman, who was Jewish, fled Paris during the War.  The center story, with Edwar G. Robinson, is usually considered the finest of the three segments.  It is not about the power of love, as are the preceding and subsequent stories, but about the descent into madness from a powerful obsession with a clairvoyant's prediction.  It is, by far, the most strikingly photographed (the bridge is amazing).  This film, while not holding up to close scrutiny, is still quite haunting.",1454803200,2,1384,4.8760683760683765

8484231,3,B005RENXQM,"The third segment of this film is a complete loss. The first segment begins well, but a badly conceived narrator's patter dilutes its effectiveness. The second segment, however is just right, hard as a diamond, cynical and cruel. Edward G. Robinson lifts his actor's reputation higher as the self made target of a fortune teller.",1419638400,,329,5.0
8484232,4,B005RENXQM,"In the early 1940's several studios released films containing short stories linked loosely by a central theme and performed by an all-star cast. ""Flesh and Fantasy""is one of these films and it is welcomed back! It consists of three unrelated tales(a fourth tale was apparently cut out).First is Betty Field playing a homely woman during Mardi Gras who falls in love with Robert Cummings. She wears a mask of a beautiful woman to attract Cummings. Second is Thomas Mitchell as a fortune teller predicting that Edward G.Robinson will kill someone. Third is Boyer as a high-wire circus performer obsessed with a nightmare that he will have a fall and who is courting a woman(Stanwyck)who looks like the woman he has seen in his dream. Unusual and imaginative film.",1414713600,7,761,4.953125
