6590557,4,B00MNU85L6,"I saw this when it was first shown on TV. I was pretty skeptical but watched it anyway.

I mean - James Bond as Sherlock Holmes? Surely that would suck big time!!!

But it didn't - it wasn't a great Holmes but it was far better than I expected. Being a BIG Sherlock Holmes Fan I was expecting pure crap - a big 1 out of 10. This has fairly good acting (once you got used to seeing James Bond in Holmes clothing that is!) - it was very capably directed - the plot was even pretty good - cinematography was far above average.

I almost forgot - Patrick Macnee played Watson and did a really good job! The older readers of this post will remember him from the 1960's TV show, The Avengers, where he played John Steed. He also played Sir Godfrey Tibbett alongside Roger Moore in the Bond flick, A View to a Kill, in 1985.

The DVD picture and sound is pretty good as well. It was good to have this DVD in my collection as I've been looking for it for quite some time. I had considered buying a bootleg version but I'm glad I waited for this version.

I would rate this a pretty good 8.0 to 8.50 out of 10 - well worth owning and watching!!",1419120000,6,1135,4.071748878923767

6590560,3,B00MNU85L6,Made for TV film.  When 1st shown in late October 1976 the network carved out 6 minutes for Presidential campaign ads.  Basically a walk through and a paycheck.  Interesting to note the boy playing Sherlocks illegitimate son is Rogers Moores actual son.,1436832000,,253,4.976190476190476

6590562,4,B00MNU85L6,"The game is afoot for Sherlock Holmes in New York (or 007 & John Steed vs Gandalf). Sir Roger Moore (in between BOND films) dons the deerstalker and Patrick Macnee (done with the AVENGERS spying) as his Watson to rescue Irene Adler, or more specifically her son Scott, from the dark clutches of the great John Huston as Proffessor Moriarty. Sherlock and Watson have more than just cold kippers to worry about,  like the kidnapping of Irene's ( & possibly Sherlock's) kid is just the tip of the iceberg, what looms is a possible world war or a world with Moriarty himself at the helm as it's master. If the plot sounds cheesy that's because IT IS,
and pretty much all the acting is either over-the-top or just plain bad, but in the most delightful fashion. In fact, I'm unashamed to admit I've been counting the days til this this 1976 TV movie was back available in some (any) format since my Betamax expired some time ago. My very favorite  here is john Huston, ""the coup de grce""  you might say. Huston is best known as a great director, (lMaltese Falcon, African Queen) but it was always amusing when he steps up the be an actor, stepping in here to fill a role Oliver Reed turned down (because of past grievances against Moore).  Although Moore delivers ""There's no time for Buts!"" with a straight face, the best lines fall on Patrick Macnee, for example his realization that the American's have tea in ""pouches."" Sets and the NYC of the 70's struggle to pass as its turn of the century counterpart. And the film's costuming does it fair share of struggling come to that. But watch for Holmes' fabulous ""Pimp-Hat"" to surface in the bottom 3rd of the picture. The picture closes with a happy ending but also with an escaped super-villian, I expect they couldn't beat to kill Huston's Moriarty just incase they'd reunite for another TV feature. That of course didn't happen, but they did get a nom for an 77 Edgar award for the tv film category.",1432944000,,1947,4.570200573065903

6590564,5,B00MNU85L6,"Sherlock Holmes Trivia:
Five Knights of the Realm have played Sherlock Holmes on film:

- Sir Ian McKellan, knighted in 1991 -- Mr. Holmes (2015)
- Sir Robert Stephens, knighted in 1995 -- The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970)
- Sir  Maurice Micklewhite (Michael Caine), knighted in 2000 -- Without a Clue (1988)
- Sir Roger Moore, knighted in 2003 -- Sherlock Holmes in New York (1976)
- Sir Christopher Lee, knighted in 2009, played Holmes in three films:
--- Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace (1962)
--- Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (1991)
--- The Incident at Victoria Falls (1992)

Roger Moore was already established as James Bond in 1976 when he played Sherlock Holmes in this made-for-TV movie.
- filmed after ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" and before ""The Spy Who loved Me"".
He was basically slumming by doing a made-for-TV movie, but this was an exceptional made-for-TV-movie.
He is a respectable Sherlock Holmes, aside from the flamboyant hairstyle (a fault common to most of the younger male members of the cast - This was the Seventies, not a good decade for hairstyles).

The solution to the mystery is clever and well-written.
The cast was worthy of a feature film release back in 1976.
A-List Hollywood Stars.
In addition to Roger Moore as Sherlock Holmes, and Patrick Macnee as Watson, you have:
-- Charlotte Rampling as Irene Adler.
-- John Huston as Professor Moriarty.
-- Gig Young (in his last film before his sensational murder/suicide) plays Mortimer McGraw, the banker whose firm is Moriarty's intended target.
Charlotte Rampling was at the height of her Hollywood fame in 1976.
Others in the supporting cast were a little past their sell-by date.

In his old age, Oscar-winning director John Huston began a new career as an actor.
Usually playing oily villains.
This Professor Moriarty is a carbon-copy of his performance two years earlier as the villain in Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"".
Seriously Evil.

Gig Young was an especially sad case.
A Hollywood Star whose career dated back to 1940.
In 1968, he won the Academy Award for Best Supping Actor, but his career went into a an alcoholic tailspin soon after.
Today he is best remembered for the bizarre circumstances of his death.
On October 19, 1978, he murdered his wife of three weeks in their Manhattan apartment, then turned the gun on himself.

Also in the supporting cast: Signe Hasso, Jackie Coogan and Leon Ames.
If you are not a fan of Turner Classic movies, these names probably mean nothing to you (maybe Jackie Coogan - he was Uncle Fester), but they were big stars in their day (young Jackie Coogan was Hollywood's Biggest Star in the 1920s).

I recorded this movie forty years ago on a VHS tape which I later burned to a home-made DVD.
The picture was terrible.
I'm glad to be able to replace it with this fine-looking DVD transfer from Twentieth-Century Fox.
(its a DVD-R, but it plays OK).

Only drawback: No subtitles or extras.

6590566,4,B00MNU85L6,"This is classic, enjoyable TV fare from the 1970s with Roger Moore shedding his James Bond image and the ever reliable Patrick MacNee at his side. As soon as I realized that Fox had seen fit to release this I added it to my cart instantly. I've been burned by these Fox archive releases before (only Warner seems to do alright by their DVD-R releases) so I hope that Fox does this TV film justice.
I'll revisit this review when the DVD arrives, but on the basis of the movie itself it is a must-buy.
UPDATE: WEll, I've had the chance to view this DVD and I am happy to report that the quality is acceptable. It's not the worst DVD (not the best either mind you). Still the print appears to be clean and I have no trouble recommending this DVD-R on-demand release.",1419811200,3,763,4.305555555555555
