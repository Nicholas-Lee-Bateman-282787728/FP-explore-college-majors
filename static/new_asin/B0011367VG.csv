8240087,2,B0011367VG,I Lived in California for 3 years so wanted a good DVD to relive the area. I was disappoointed in the quality as I tried to play it on a 8 foot screen. The image was so bad that I probably will not watch all the DVDs.,1332028800,,217,3.6382978723404253
8240088,4,B0011367VG,"I've watched two of the four DVDs in the set so far. I've really enjoyed the aerial views of  CA, and the additional DVD of Arizona.

Sound quality is excellent. Narration is informative. Watching is very relaxing, like being on a mini-vacation.",1231459200,5,245,4.809523809523809
