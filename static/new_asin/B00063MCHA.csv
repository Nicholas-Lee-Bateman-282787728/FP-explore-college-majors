2164166,4,B00063MCHA,"""The Twin Towers"" started out as a documentary about the New York City Police Department's Emergency Services Team (EST), the elite group of police officers that deal with everything from suicidal people determined to jump off bridges to hostage situations.  The story of these heroic young men so intrigued television producer Dick Wolf (best known for the ""Law & Order"" series) that he began this documentary as a means of selling a network on committing to a series based on the day-to-day lives of these men and their fascinating job.  It's entirely conceivable that such a show would have come to fruition, had not the events at the World Trade Center taken place.

As noted by the editorial review, this documentary feels abruptly cut short: after all, the main subject of the piece, DET Joseph V. Vigiano, died in the September 11th attacks.  What began as a look at the lives and work of the EST becomes a memorial to what we lost that day in the form of a father who lost his two sons (Det. Joseph Viggiano and his brother John, a NYC fireman) in the attacks.

It is the incompleteness of this documentary, and the profound sense of unfulfilled curiosity about the men it profiles, that leads me to grant the story four stars instead of five.  In no way is it an idictment of its ability to stir and inspire.",1097193600,8,1317,4.6068376068376065

2164168,5,B00063MCHA,"Thank you for taking the time to read this message and I hope it offers some help in making your decision. To start I am a member of ESU in Long Island and I know several of the men in this documentary through schools and training. One of the men in this video transfered to my department several years ago and is now my partner in ESU. He was in the same Truck with Joe Vig and talks of him in the highest regards, almost super human. I was at a school with NYPD ESU this summer. Several men I was training with asked me if I watched the documentary, I had not and was lent the video. Within the first few minutes of the video I was glued to my seat and almost in tears when I saw Joes kids and watched the testimony of Joes teamates, my partner being one of them. I do not want to tell you any of the details in the video as to not wanting to spoil it for you. I will tell you this, if you are interested in a career in law enforcement and eventually ESU this is almost a rite of passage for you to watch. I asked my 18 year old son, who is curently on the NYPD list and has asperations of being a member of ESU, to watch this video. He told me it was the most motivating video he has ever seen and would be even more honored to have this career. This video is so powerful that when you begin Special Training School (STS) for ESU this is one of the first videos you watch before starting your training. GREAT VIDEO, it will rejuvenate and inspire you, the good guys are still here and doing some incredible things. GOD BLESS",1353801600,6,1527,4.00983606557377
2164169,5,B00063MCHA,well worth your time to view. need to remember the people who lost lives on 911 and the families who sacrificed.,1341360000,3,112,4.380952380952381
2164170,4,B00063MCHA,"I really liked this DVD ""Twin Towers""  & thought it was a great documentary for all to see what officers, especially the ""special units"" go through on a daily basis.  Det. Joe Vigiano must have been an amazing person to have known both in his job & his personal life for he seemed to put so much into everything he did.
  My complaint is that this video should have been called ""Joe Vigiano's Story"" for there was absolutely NOTHING on his brother John. The ""only thing""
we found out was that John was a firefighter & he died in the Trader Centers & that's about it. The entire story was about Joe.  VERY misleading due to the cover & the info on the back of case.",1341014400,,664,4.238095238095238
2164171,5,B00063MCHA,"A brief but very emotional look at the ESU of the NYPD. The short film focuses on Det. Joe Vigiano, who was killed in the North Tower on 9/11. I remember this film won an Academy Award a few years ago. It is very poignant film and a wonderful dedication to Joe. I believe the producers were doing a series on ESU when 6 months later tragedy struck. I highly recommend.",1261094400,,368,4.197183098591549
2164172,5,B00063MCHA,It was interesting then shocking then a Tear jerker. It should be standard video for every crisis counselor and college history class,1241136000,,133,5.090909090909091
2164173,5,B00063MCHA,"THIS DVD VIDEO WAS VERY HEART WARMING AND QUITE GOOD TO SEE THAT EACH BROTHER LOVED EACH OTHER AND INCLUDING THEIR FAMILIES.  JESUS WANTS US TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS HE HAS LOVED US.  THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER REALLY TOLD THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT EACH AND EVERYONE.  MY SPOUSE AND I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING THE FILM.  THE TRUE EVENTS AND HAPPENINGS WERE VERY REAL AND WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT DAY ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001...,  THE VERY TRUE FACTS ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL.

I COULD SAY THIS FOR A VERY TRUE FACT AND TRUTH FROM JESUS CHRIST,  WE ARE IN OUR LAST DAYS ON THIS EARTH AND WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN JESUS CHRIST AS THEIR PERSONAL LORD AND SAVIOR WILL BE SAVED.  SURE WE ALL WILL BE JUDGED BY HIM WHEN HE RETURNS TO THIS EARTH, THE UNSAVED WILL BE JUDGED FIRST BEFORE I AND OTHER CHRISTIANS.  ANYWAY LET'S BE CAREFUL WHO WE INVITE OR LET THROUGH AT OUR AIRPORTS, SHALL WE.  WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THIS TO EVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN OUR NATION, DO WE?  GOD IS GOOD ALL THE TIME.",1209081600,,999,4.288770053475936
2164174,4,B00063MCHA,"This is outstanding footage on Joseph Vigiano, who was a highly decorated member of the NYPD Emergency Services.  I did not truly understand the extreme peril that an EMS officer faces on a daily basis and am grateful to know more details of what they do and sacrifice for those they help.  I was also touched by the interview with Joseph's father who was a NYC fire fighter.  His words of guidance that he said to his sons to never leave the house without giving your family a hug and telling them you love them (no matter if you've had a disagreement or not) is wonderful advice for us all.  I do wish there had been an interview with Joseph's wife for more of a personal touch about Joseph.  Joseph's brother John Vigliano, Jr., who was a fireman, also died in the World Trade Center.  I really wish there was something on him of substance since the title of this is ""Twin Towers"" and not just ""Tower"".  The jacket of the DVD states that this is ""The true story of two brothers whose courage will never be forgotten"" so I was quite surprised to not see as much on John, Jr. as there was on Joseph.  I realize the story started about Joseph and his EMS unit but John died too and there should be more about him and his last moments as they are known by witnesses. This documentary ends abruptly, just as Joseph and John's lives did, but I felt that it still needed an epilogue to tie things up.  I'm not sure that I ever saw John, Jr. in life in the footage, and if he is there and one of the one's hugging Joseph at the awards ceremony (as I suspect) I wish they would have put his name as a subtitle under him so that those watching would know.  It touched me so much to see Joseph with his boys and reminds us that so many who lost their lives on 9/11 were young parents.  All in all this is a wonderful documentary but I only gave it four stars due to the lack of information on John, Jr.  It is extremely well done and definitely worth the money and time to watch it over and over again.",1167955200,,1994,4.177545691906006
2164175,5,B00063MCHA,"This 35 minute documentary really illustrates the quality and heroism of the people that died on September 11, 2001 in New York.

This film is a brief tribute to a few of them.  Particularly the Vigiano family that lost two sons (a firefighter and a police officer)in the World Trade Centers.  These men and those like them were heroes and civic role models.

No greater love has a person than to lay down ones life for a friend.

After watching this film, I am moved to say thank you to every police officer, firefighter and first response person. I was saddened by the tragedy but also extremely encouraged to get a glimpse at the quality of goodness in the people that helped save so many lives that day.",1140048000,11,707,4.4921875
2164176,5,B00063MCHA,"Twin Towers shows the true commitment of a small portion of the NYPD to the safety of people living in and visiting New York City.  While the Vigiano family lost two sons, there were 13 other ESU officers killed on 9/11 and two others from the same squad; Officer John D'Allara, a former teacher and 17 year ESU veteran and Sgt Mike Curtin who was a former Marine Sgt. Major who fought in Desert Storm and was a rescuer at the first Trade Center Bombing and also did rescue and recovery work at the Oklahoma City Bombing.

While they are not mentioned in the Twin Towers, we should remember the other ESU officers lost on 9/11:  Sgt. John Coughlin, Sgt. Rodney Gillis, PO Brian McDonnell, PO Vincent Danz, PO Jerome Dominguez, PO Walter Weaver, PO Stephen Driscoll, PO Santos Valentin, PO Ronald Kloepfer, PO Thomas Langone and PO Paul Talty.",1126828800,5,842,4.6
