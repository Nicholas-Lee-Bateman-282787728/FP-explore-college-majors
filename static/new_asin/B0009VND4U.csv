8067551,1,B0009VND4U,The re-recorded video was awful! I do not let my children watch it due to the prejudice references. The cartoons are very old. Mel Blanc does not do the voices. Don't waste your money! I only gave this one star because it won't let you rate it without a star.,1260921600,,259,4.2
8067552,3,B0009VND4U,"I am an avid collector of popular animation and Looney Tunes is probably the most popular and also the most edited or dubbed due to the content.  I wish they'd release the box sets they had on Laser Disc way back when and release the cartoons as they did then.... all uncut and unedited.  Now the newer box sets are uncut that they have out now on dvd but you will not see the selections like they had on Laser such as 'Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips"".  Crude, yes.  Insensitive, yes.  But in its day, this cartoon and many others show the 'sign of the times' and people do not watch these now and feel the feelings they did back then.  Looney Tunes was never meant for kids and they should still be released this way, but don't hold back the so-called, politically incorrect' ones.

Now, this brings me to this disc.  I bought this due to the two 'politically incorrect' cartoons that another reviewer mentioned on their review.  Like many others, I try to find raw and original cartoons and this set is definately raw.  No enhancing or remastering and color is washed out compared to Warner Brother releases.  This is not made by Warner Brothers but rather by ANS Entertainment and quality is like a dvd+r that you record yourself with a stand-alone dvd recorder and in fact, the disc is a DVD+R.  It is a blue back side to the disc and not the silver you see from commercial companies such as MGM, WB or Sony, etc....  Inside the clear case are pictures for many Hispanic movies on dvd by the company (Cuentos Clasicos) as they have written.  To their credit, the label on the disc is well done as well as the front/rear cover of the case.  But I feel like I bought this in the bootleg area of a flea market and not legitamately from an on-site store like Amazon.  The quality is very acceptable and watchable but not anything to write home about and I will keep the disc due to the cartoons that are not 'PC' and that you cannot get on dvd now.  I just want people to beware of the disc the cartoons are on and quality.",1259625600,15,2017,4.321808510638298

8067554,4,B0009VND4U,"Here are the 10 titles included (all WB, in color):

Case of the Missing Hare +

Daffy Duckaroo

All This and Rabbit Stew !!

Daffy - The Commando !!

The Wabbit Who Came to Supper +

To Duck or Not To Duck

A Corny Concerto *

Daffy's Southern Exposure

Falling Hare +

Fresh Hare

The ones marked with a + or a * have been restored and released in an official WB Golden Collection (* means volume 2, + is vol 3).  The ones with !! are quite politically incorrect.

""Stew"" could easily have been written for Elmer Fudd, but the hunter is a Step-n-fetch-it type.  The negative stereotypes make us wince now, but Bugs defeats him with all the usual tactics that foil Fudd.

""Commando"" portrays German military in an unflattering light, but  that's just sensible propaganda for the time.",1134777600,32,785,4.460992907801418
