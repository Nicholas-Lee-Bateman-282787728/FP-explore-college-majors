2193941,4,B0006SSPIU,"This was a great play, Deborah Cox was wonderful, the singing of all the characters was unbelievable.  The interaction between the male characters was hysterical.  The character of Khalif added just the right amount of spice to the pot without being over the top.  All in all a great play about the African American male-female relationship at all different age levels.",1152144000,16,369,5.016393442622951

2193954,4,B0006SSPIU,"I waited quite some time for this video and it was not worth the wait.  The quality was excellent but the substance was shallow and predictable.  The entertainment factor was okay but the most not worthy aspect was the star, Deborah Cox and that amazing voice. The songs were appealing and well suited to the vocal performances.",1395273600,,328,4.7368421052631575

2193968,3,B0006SSPIU,Time and time again we watch movies that waste our time. This movie isn't one of them. I can see this as a big screen film. As long as they could change a few things. This one is a must watch.,1316217600,,192,3.707317073170732

2193972,5,B0006SSPIU,"BE played this movie all day one Sunday and I really got into it. I loved it! When I got my copy, I was a little disappointed because it was a bad copy. I am going to make another purchase of it brand new on the economy next time. I consider my black artist films a treat and do order them regularly. The plot of the play was well done and the actor's are well driven and do a wonderful job making the play really come alive. You draw tears from it if you are a person who has ever experienced love in a peculiar way. I loved it. You would miss out if you thought twice to make this purchase. It was worth buying the DVD brand new. I love to watch it on Sunday's when I can relax and get the message again. The singing is pretty pretty nice toooo. Bring on the popcorn.",1260057600,,769,3.9358974358974357

2193976,5,B0006SSPIU,"This is a great movie.  Realize that it is a taping of the stage play, not a movie of the stage play.  The play is great and the character's funny.  The songs are fun and uplifting.",1239408000,,181,3.9722222222222223
2193977,2,B0006SSPIU,This does not compare to Tyler Perry. It was an okay movie. I am the type of person that will watch my movies over and over again if I like them. I've only seen this one once. It would be like my last pick of the litter.,1235606400,,220,3.702127659574468

2193981,5,B0006SSPIU,This stage play demonstrated the power of love. The type of love that can only come through the loving God that we serve. What a wonderful & magical way to bring couples with unique but similar issues together.,1218499200,,210,4.552631578947368
2193982,3,B0006SSPIU,"After watching Talberts 'Fabric of A Man', I decided to get this play and liked it. I give it 3.5 stars as a play rating.  It was engaging, funny and enlightening. It is about three couples who are at a crossroad in their relationship.  All three wants commitments from their lovers. I am one of many women unsure about marriage today.
Let's talk about Deborah Cox's role. She played a woman (Monique) who desperately wanted her boyfriend (played by the handsome Mel Jackson) to commit and marry her.  He simply did not want to.  I really enjoyed the dialogue between the two. He says its better to remain live-in lovers because the relationship stays fresh. He compared it to leasing a car. While Deborah Cox says marrying a woman is like buying a house. Treat them right and their value increases.  I actually liked the fact that Mel was honest about his feelings. Plus wait til you hear his rationale...funny. A new neighbor mends the three couples back together.  In the end the men all see the light, but one of then should have stood his ground.  The play of course had spirtual undertones but was still enjoyable.
A nice outro from the writer is also present.
Not all characters were enjoyable (some a bit annoying) but they worked well together.
Look out for the ever handsome Mykel Shannon.",1214784000,,1299,4.646288209606987
2193983,4,B0006SSPIU,"LOVE IT!!! Buddy Lewis aka Renzo is so funny in this one. Deborah Cox is amazing as always. Cassie Davis (House of Pain) is her ole sweet christian self. Chico Bennymon was surprisingly good too. Joi Campbell was new to me but she held her own. Man Man and his Littles lol and you cant go wrong with that fine piece of chocolate Mel Jackson. If you like stage plays this is a must see. Production was great, taping was great and story  line is very relatable.",1211846400,,459,4.275862068965517
2193984,5,B0006SSPIU,This is a great play. It gives you different and funny look at relationships and what couples go through. I wish i could have seen it live. Worth watching,1209772800,,154,4.344827586206897
2193995,5,B0006SSPIU,"IF YOU LOVE TYLER PERRY..THEN YOU'LL LOVE THIS PLAY.  DAVID TALBERT IS JUST AS A GREAT PLAY WRITER AS TYLER PERRY.  I KNOW THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE MADEA,BUT SOME OF THE CHARACTERS IN LOVE ON LAYAWAY IS AS WE SAY THE BOMB! I WAS IN STITCHES.. I RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO ANY ONE THAT NEED SOME WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO GET THROUGH THE STRUGGLES OF LIFE..............",1206489600,,361,4.373134328358209
2193996,3,B0006SSPIU,"I give this 3.5 stars. I'm stuck somewhere in the middle because after finishing it I liked it. It was cute. But I didn't give it 4 stars because I started watching it and it turned me off so much that I stopped the dvd. Then it came on BET Sunday and I was kinda flipping back & forth and catching bits that I hadn't seen. And ended up putting the dvd back in so I could finish it. The Epiphany character got on my nerves sooooo freaking bad & that's mainly the reason why I stopped the dvd the first time.

Monique is dating committment-phobe Anthony. I didn't agree with some of his views but she had been letting him milk her for 4 1/2 years so why should he pay for the milk after all that time. She did teach him a few things about treating a woman right but I didn't look too highly upon her because she was yet another sister with good talk but had ""stupid woman disease"" in her actions. Epiphany didn't see what a good thing she had with Reggie. He should've dropped her anyway. She had too much baggage and attitude and he didn't need it. Renzo was over-the-top which was either funny or annoying depending on the scene.",1203638400,,1130,4.207373271889401

2193998,5,B0006SSPIU,This was an awesome play and anyone who gave it less than 5 stars doesn't know what their talking about.  The singing and acting were perfect.  This is a play you have to buy.,1187049600,3,175,4.117647058823529

2194000,4,B0006SSPIU,"Excellent movie that deals with various relationships. It certainly touches on the inner workings of the human heart based on different individuals as well as different age groups.

A great mixture of comedy and drama. Most of us can relate to this in one way or another. Great acting.",1178668800,3,285,4.816326530612245

8042740,5,B0006SSPIU,I really liked this play and thought it was funny and deep at the same time. When the play first starts off it takes a couple of minutes to spark your attention but the play gets better after about ten or fifteen minutes and from there you just laugh all the way. I enjoyed the music and perspective of the play. Although it was about love it was not depressing. The play made me think and kept me entertained. You will definitely not be disappointed if you like romance and comedy at the same time.,1519257600,,499,4.2631578947368425
