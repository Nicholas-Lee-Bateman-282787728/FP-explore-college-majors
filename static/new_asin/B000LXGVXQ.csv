8325397,4,B000LXGVXQ,Good documentary type movie on road racing go karts.  This is not a music video type of movie such as those from severe racing.  Wish there were more video footage from other karts and more race footage all together.  Would have also liked to have some special features but good video overall gets you pumped to go racing.,1233705600,,322,4.517241379310345

I have been racing on the national level for 3 years, and the presentation shows the passion level these guys and gals have. With ages from 16 to well past retirement, this sport gives promise to racers dreams, and Pierre's video gives the viewer a little taste of this exciting sport. The in Kart action is very well done, and I must say the production of the video is VER professional.. Better than some of the Grammy winners.. It get's my vote!!  Karl Dulle Laydown 54 NEW HAMPSHIRE KARTING ASSOCIATION...

And as a last comment.. Get off the couch when your'e done watching this video, and get racing baby!",1172361600,2,745,4.723076923076923
