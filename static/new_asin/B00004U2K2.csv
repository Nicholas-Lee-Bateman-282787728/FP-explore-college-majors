Fortunately, this tape is pretty good. There are three tales on it;  I'll tell you right off the bat that the first, 'Three for the Pit,' is my  least favorite. It's about two guys hired to dig a body out of a grave, and  what happens afterward. Dig, they do. And dig, and dig, and dig. However,  the dialogue is pretty well-written and the acting is good, and that  ultimately keeps the viewer from losing patience. Unfortunately, the whole  thing kind of falls a little flat at the end. The saving graces are the  technical aspects, the humor, and the music.
The pace picks up with the  second installment, 'The Mistress'. This is about an illicit romance that  goes really, horribly wrong. The piece is the one of the three that's  actually shot on film instead of video, and it shows. It's dark,  well-directed, and pleasing to the eye. This one is my favorite, with good  acting, and some nice lighting. The story is a little chilling and the  ending is nice and shivery, the way a 'Twisted Reality' should be. Don't  miss it.
The main part of the tape finishes off with a cracking little  tale called 'Pillow Talk', starring the same guys from the first tale on  the tape. The story is about a demon accidentally brought to earth - which  doesn't really explain the title unless you watch! The only thing that  brings this one down is the lighting near the end, which is very murky, but  is understandable because this one is obviously shot on older equipment.  However the effects are funny and a little gory and definitely make it an  enjoyable end cap.
The nicest part about this tape is that the filmmakers  included some outtakes and behind-the-scenes extras (always a favorite) and  that really adds value to the whole package.
Overall, a worthy  independent film purchase, and one you can enjoy again and again.",961718400,2,1969,4.586206896551724
8231630,4,B00004U2K2,"After Realm of the Bizarre, I wondered if the guys at Dept. 13 could ever top that tape. I must say that Twisted Realities is as good if not better!  Three for the Pit features two hapless rednecks who are hired by a strange  man to dig up a grave. Little down they know what awaits them. The  graverobbers are played by returning favorite Barry King and newcomer,  Michael A Clark. The chemistry between these two is awesome as they play  off of each other. The makeup effects are done by Joseph Garmon and they  are very realistic and gruesome.  The Mistress is a dark moody story about  obessive love and betrayal. I liked this story and the black and white  photography was perfect way to set the tone. This one had a nice twist for  an ending too. Pillow Talk had to be the most original story in terms of  the monster our two guys unwittingly release when they read from an ancient  spellbook. Barry King and Michael A Clark play the two guys and they are as  good in this story as they were in Three For the Pit. This story had as  many scares as it did laughs.  Lastly, I wanted to compliment the great  score used on this tape. All the music was composed by Jim Townsend and he  perfectly captured the mood for each story even though each one was  uniquely different. Twisted Realities is another winner from Dept. 13 and I  highly recommend it!",961459200,,1354,4.344
