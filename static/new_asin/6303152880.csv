I have a VHS copy from the U.S. that I got in 1989 when I was 3 years old. I'm 22 now and I still love the film that much, I'm actually watching it right now.

This review may contain spoilers!

The Land Of Faraway or Mio Min Mio, as most people know it, is the story of a boy named Bosse. His adoptive parents hate him and let him know it, the older kids bully him, and he only has two real friends: Mrs. Lundin a nice young woman who works at a local store and Benke a boy from school. Bosse greatest dream is to have a father that loves him like Benke. One day Mrs. Lundin gives Bosse a golden apple and asks him to mail a post card for her. The post card is to the King of the Land of Faraway and says something like ""the one you have been looking for is here; he will have an apple of gold in his hand"". Then out of a bottle on the ground a giant head/spirit emerges and takes Bosse away to the Land of Faraway. Bosse finds out that he's really Mio the Prince of the Land of Faraway! But there is a great evil man named Kato who steals children and turns them into birds, legend says that only a Prince can kill Kato and save the children. So Mio/Bosse sets of with friend Jum-Jum/Benke on an awesome adventure to defeat Kato!

The music in the film is so beautiful and haunting; you will be humming it for days. The acting by Nick Pickard as Bosse/Mio and Christian Bale as Benke/Jum-Jum is outstanding. I particularly love the lighting in the film; firelight creates creepy shadows across the sets and really sets the mood for the darker scenes. The copy I have is old so the sound is really bad and since the movie was made in the late 1980s the video quality looks sort of fuzzy and out of focus compared to new DVDs.

I would recommend this movie to every kid I have ever met and to adults who are fantasy fans.",1235692800,5,1949,4.015463917525773
597097,5,6303152880,"Bosse Ohlsson is an average boy living in Stockholm with his horrid Aunt Edna and Uncle Sixten. On one particularly cruel day he goes out with his best friend to fly kites and on the way home(when he was already late), boys take his hat and get it dirty. Aunt Edna makes such a bad fuss that Bosse decides to run away to find his father. He visits the local shop and the owner gives him an apple and a letter to mail. He stops at a bench area and just as he's about to eat the apple, it turns golden and a spirit comes out of a bottle lying on the ground. It turns out that the spirit is from the land of faraway and has been sent to bring Bosse there to meet his father. Bosse goes to the land of faraway and his finds out his real name is Mio and he has a horse named Miramis. Joy is short lived though because he finds out that an evil night Kato has kidnapped all the children and is keeping them prisoner outside of the land. Since Mio is the only child of royal blood, he must journey with Jum Jum and Miramis to save the children and destroy Kato.
I love this movie as it is one of my childhood favorites. It's a wonderful tale and should be more honored.",1014768000,26,1162,3.9914163090128754
597098,4,6303152880,"Eleven year old Bosse Ohlsson, who lives in Stockholm with his over-bearing Aunt Edna, dreams of finding his father. One night, he decides to run away to find his father when a spirit recognizes him and flies him to the beautiful Land of Faraway. There, Bosse is reunited with his father, whom he finds is the king in the Land of Faraway. There he learns that his real name is Mio but he and his father's joy are short-lived. Kato, the evil knight from the Land Outside, has kidnapped and placed terrible spells on most of the children of the kingdom. According to the legends however, the only one who can destroy Kato and save the children must be a male child of royal blood. So with a white horse named Miramis and great friend Jum Jum, Mio sets out for Kato's castle.
Though this film is rated ""NR: Not Rated"", in my opinion it's actually a pretty dark movie for kids. But the plot is definitely made out for kids for example, an evil knight who kidnaps children and cast spells on them. But the reason for the 4 stars mostly is that 1) the plot is pretty thin, 2) is pretty slow at some points, and 3) the dialogue isn't that much good.
But the good points are that in a way the movie is intriguing. I especially love the music and the last song. Since this movie is hard to find, if you're interested in getting this movie, there's another version called ""Mio in the Land of Faraway"" which might be easier to find.",1009065600,14,1421,4.325842696629214
7841081,5,6303152880,"Just watched this today. Excellent movie. Very similar to Harry Potter. Mean Aunt and Uncle, carried off to another land by someone with a big beard, cloak of invisibility, magic sword, fights the baddie with a trusted friend and saves the Day. If you want fantasy not plagiarized with some heavy 80s effects, this is the story for you.",1515196800,,336,4.711864406779661

7841089,3,6303152880,"A classic '80s movie that only makes you say, ""Why did I enjoy this movie so much when I was a kid?"" Because of this movie I actually went out and bought the book, which wasn't to bad, and read that before I received the movie. Needless to say the movie could have been much better if it would have followed the book a bit closer. Overall the movie wasn't a bad buy (6.49+ shipping) and I am sure my children will watch it as long as I have a VHS player available.",1268870400,,464,4.0
7841090,5,6303152880,"I just bought a used copy of this movie (so hard to find!) here on Amazon and it arrived today.  I wanted to share this movie with my kiddos.  This was one of my brother's and my favorite movies when we were little.  It's like a combination of ""Neverending Story"" and a Miyazaki film all rolled into one.  Fairytale, selflessness, bravery and sweetness.  After 2 decades I still hum the soundtrack and occassionally quote some of the character lines.  Now my kids will understand what I've been quoting and humming all this time!

ps  My kids (ages 3-7) loved the movie when they saw it tonight!",1262563200,3,595,4.547169811320755
