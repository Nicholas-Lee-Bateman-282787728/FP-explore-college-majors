8758611,5,B01EGQJS92,"This DVD contains one GREAT trail ride that last for over 80 minutes. The accompanying music provides some nice incentive to keep you pushing forward throughout the workout. The first portion of the DVD is more instructional and provides some up front training guidance, and it also familiarizes you with the dashboard. After the first use, I skip this portion and jump right to the ride. I particularly like this DVD because it is over 98% single rider, with no one in front of you. You do pass other bikers and walkers on the trail, and a few of the cyclists stay in front for a bit, but not for long. Nice scenery overall, and you feel like you are on a very realistic trail ride.
If you are familiar with this series of DVDs you will find NO instructional track during the 80+ minute trail ride, but you still have two options - the music option or just the sounds of the ride option. .
Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD as part of your overall indoor cycling collection. I own over 15 of these titles, and they are a great motivator for me to keep improving my cardio vascular conditioning along with a slow but steady weight loss .",1509494400,,1146,4.410377358490566
8758612,5,B01EGQJS92,"I admit I was taken back when I realized we were riding on a ""bike path"" however my opinion quickly changed, as well as my heart rate.

This is a very fun and invigorating dvd.  It has great scenery really makes you work and makes a great mid week ride.

I am a cyclocross and mountain bike racer and I highly recommend this dvd. It simulates some of the same intensities as a cx or mountain bike race.",1417392000,,402,4.128205128205129
8758613,5,B01EGQJS92,"I felt like I was riding alone along the American River Trail by the Sacramento River. This is not a ride along a straight river. There are multiple twists and turns. Some of them were a little bit tricky at a high speed.

I saw and heard only the sights and sounds on this very long virtual ride with a real feel of being there in person. The ride was 93 minutes, a  32-mile path, so it makes for a great workout! It's actually designed so it can be used for time trial and triathlon training.

The scenery is very pretty. Only occasionally do we see a glimpse of the actual river, but we're working so hard that there really isn't time to spend enjoying the view anyway.

This one is different from most of the others because it doesn't have a narrated ride option. You can choose from Track 1. Music over the natural sounds of the ride, or Track 2. The natural sounds of the ride or Track 2. The natural sounds of the ride.

I rode with the natural sounds of the ride, which made it very authentic. I felt like I was out there riding alone, with an occasional rider or jogger.

It's important to note that when you first start, there are a couple of very nice video demos. I hadn't realized that and for a moment thought I was on a different ride. I enjoyed the part of that ride that was on the demo as well.",1387670400,,1312,4.16600790513834

The video is fun and exciting, and its easy to forget that you're riding at home instead of on this trial.",1300406400,,674,8.375
8758615,5,B01EGQJS92,"I've bought just about every one of this cycling video series.  I train mostly on a stationary trainer for Triathlons.  Kind of freaked out of traveling on the road after being hit by cars and getting major damage (broken bones, road rash, lacerations, etc) from inattentive and impaired car drivers.  These videos give me a feeling of being on the road without the danger.  Plus, they are darn fun to do and the training time goes by really quick.",1261440000,4,448,4.632911392405063
