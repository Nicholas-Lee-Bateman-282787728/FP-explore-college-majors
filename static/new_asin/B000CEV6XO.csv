2460553,5,B000CEV6XO,"A great trip down memory lane for an old skier.  Took me back to people, places and events with special signifigance.  For someone who isn't an old skier it's a look at history which shows what it used to look like and how we used to do it.",1168300800,6,240,3.9791666666666665

8098349,5,B000CEV6XO,Good to see skiing in the 60s (50s?) and classic ski resorts in the US Some humor also and some Olympic footage I think too.,1424217600,,124,4.0

8098351,5,B000CEV6XO,"A must see for anyone with memories of the ""Old Days."" I knew one of the guys in ""The Last of the Ski Bums"" and he just passed away. It was a great trip down memory lane. RIP Ron Funk.",1393372800,,184,3.625
8098352,5,B000CEV6XO,"I am a ski geek. I write about skiing for a living and I ski to live. I love ski history and so finding this collection of classic ski films was pure gold. The quality is what you'd expect -- old movies, scratchy, black and white, etc. but overall quite enjoyable to watch. Just don't expect these to be of Matchstick Productions or even newer Warren Miller quality. These are pioneering ski movies made my skiing pioneers. If this is your cup or tea, or perhaps your preferred piste, you'll love 'em!",1308614400,2,501,4.456521739130435
8098353,5,B000CEV6XO,"Wonderful films from the 1960's. I got to know Dick Barrymore on a summer ski trip South America in 1960s, but had lost touch with him in recent years. He was a great guy and loads of fun to be with. I think his ski cinematography remains the standard by others are to be measured.

It's great fun to watch the skiers cut through powder on skinny skis and Arlberg technique. However, if one looks closely the rudiments of what has become modern powder skiing skills are evident. An entertaining evening - to be repeated each November. One of the disks was unplayable - Amazon took it back.",1291420800,2,589,4.453703703703703
8098354,5,B000CEV6XO,"This is trip back through time, showing the development of skiing from the 1930s and 40s through the 60s and early 70s. Lang's films show what early ski equipment looked like, how it functioned and why early skiers had to be real athletes. Excellent production and close-ups of how early equipment looked and worked.  Jay's films are quite similar to each other, but give an interesting and humorous look at the development of ski areas and equipment, as well as different ski techniques as time moved along. Barrymore's contributions are great to watch and show expert skiers skiing lines that many of the skiing public could actually ski -- as opposed to jumping cliffs and skiing extreme terrain as is usually shown in today's films. ""Ski Bums"" alone is worth the cost of this set. Interesting history you'll never see elsewhere. And, as always, promptly shipped by Amazon.",1278028800,5,876,4.918918918918919
8098355,5,B000CEV6XO,"Sit back and relax to hours of fun memories.  Yes the sound could be better.  Yes they are a bit ""old fashioned"".  But after a day on the slopes nothing is better than watching this collection of classic ski movies.  Highly recommended for skiers of all ages.",1269648000,2,259,4.446808510638298
8098356,5,B000CEV6XO,"This is a wonderful collection of ski movie classics. It brings back great memories.  As a kid, I remember going to see a John Jay movie in Albany, NY in the early 60's. His drole humor and home movie feel makes it fun to watch all over again.  The 1960 Winter Olympic footage at Squaw Valley, Dick Barrymore's  ""The last of the Ski Bums"" and Otto Lang's classic B&W movies are worth adding to your collection.  These movies are a reminder of skiings rich history. It puts the emphasis on the joy, the exhilaration and the pure fun of skiing. You won't be disappointed.",1174608000,8,569,4.4423076923076925
