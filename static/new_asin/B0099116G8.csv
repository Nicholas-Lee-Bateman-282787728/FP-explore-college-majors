5278558,4,B0099116G8,"This is one of the hardest Robert Mitchum films to find, so I was excited to see it available at last. Mitchum is brilliant, as usual, in this. The film is not for the faint of heart--it's an intense film full of sadness, with some brutal moments. Mitchum was really on a roll with this film, ""The Yakuza,"" ""The Friends Of Eddie Coyle,"" etc.",1350604800,6,341,4.34375
8537896,1,B0099116G8,"The only thing I liked were the actors, Robert Mitchum  and Jan-Michael Vincent. A sad story.",1524960000,,93,4.8125
8537897,5,B0099116G8,"Although not terribly keen on the film,I thought Jan's portrayal was amazing.  It was not an easy part.",1473811200,,103,4.722222222222222

8537899,5,B0099116G8,"I first saw this movie on network TV in the middle of the night in 1987, and it just drew me in. My favorite films are those that manage to create their own unique atmosphere, not just in the story line and subject matter, but in the geographical locale, music, etc., and this film does just that. I managed to tape part of it when I first saw it in '87, and that kept me going until it aired again on a cable channel five years later in 1992. I looked for this movie on VHS all through the 1990s, to no avail. It's amazing that it took this long for it to finally make it on DVD. Robert Mitchum was brilliant in this film. I'm not going to go into a deep review here. I would suggest to anyone reading this that if you're looking for something a little different, check this out and enjoy with an open mind. If you need a perfect happy ending kind of movie, stay away.",1397347200,,869,4.058139534883721
8537900,5,B0099116G8,I never could find this movie on VHS. All I had was a copy I made off of TV. So I was thrilled to find the DVD. This is a must have for all Jan Michael Vincent fans.,1388534400,,165,3.3684210526315788
8537901,2,B0099116G8,"When you think about it this movie is pretty absurd.  Harry Graham(Robert Mitchum) gets sent up the river for murdering his wife(Sally Kirkland) while in a drunken state.  Released thirteen years later his son, Jimmy (Jan-Michael Vincent), who witnessed the murder and subsequently went from orphanages to foster homes looks him up.  Harry is living in a ramshackle trailer in Wildwood, New Jersey and carrying on with one of the trailer park ladies(Brenda Vaccarro).  Jimmy comes to stay with Harry but what what are his ulterior motives-to rekindle the familial bond, to find out why Harry did the dastardly deed, or kill Harry.  Unfortunately the focal point of the movie is Jimmy and not Harry.  Jimmy needs to be played by an actor of consummate skill and Vincent has the range of a slab of meat.  The only thing he does well is take his shirt off.  He should have auditioned for ""Magic Mike"" but you have to see to believe Vincent's one dance scene in the movie.  Ultimately the film goes adrift and you really don't care what happens.  A shame because Mitchum and Vaccaro are quite good.  If you're a Mitchum completist this movie may be of marginal interest.",1363219200,5,1166,4.751243781094527
8537902,5,B0099116G8,"I have been looking for this movie for years, and I am very pleased with the DVD.  I like most of Robert Mitchum's  movies, he is my favorite actor.",1361491200,2,148,4.068965517241379
8537903,3,B0099116G8,"'Going Home' (1971) is a disturbing slice-of-life drama with made-for-TV production values, strong performances by Robert Mitchum and Brenda Vaccaro, and some very dark themes.  Comparisons with Mitchum's iconical 'Night of the Hunter' (4 1/2 stars) in style and content are virtually nonexistant, but his portrayal of reformed wife-killer Harry Graham is almost as impressive in its nuance as was his chilling, surreal turn as Harry Powell in Charles Laughton's 1955 masterpiece.  How he can here, given such a bare script and banal direction, elicit sympathy and even respect from the viewer (at least this one-- and I generally despise works that attempt to excuse criminal behavior by invoking moral relativity or dimestore psychology) is a tribute to his tough-and-tired persona and underrated acting skills (and, actually, that bare script I referenced, which wisely avoids framing Graham's character via the usual mitigating exposition and simply allows him to live with his past).  Having said that, it's hard to recommend this otherwise bland and unpleasant story, unless you have a weak spot for downbeat '70s cinema, as I do, or are interested in seeing an all-but-forgotten title with Mitchum at his vulnerably masculine best.  Movie earns 3 stars; Warner Archives' DVD-R, offering a sharp, clean anamorphic-widescreen picture with clear audio and no extras, 3-plus.",1359936000,4,1378,5.455399061032864
8537904,4,B0099116G8,"If you're a Robert Mitchum fan you'll enjoy this movie, it's quite a sad, involved plot, not one that will appeal to everyone, but it does keep your interest. The support actors Jan Michael Vincent and Brenda Vaccaro do a fine job and as usual Robert Mitchum acts the part to perfection. I can understand why this movie never went down as a main line movie basically because the subject matter is not a pleasant one, but as they say these things do happen in life and the difficult story is handled quite well. You could say it's a thought provoking film. Definitely worth watching in my view.",1354406400,6,593,4.5
8537905,4,B0099116G8,"A very tense drama.  Both Robert Mitchum & Jan Michael Vincent played their roles really well.  The movie definitely showed how violence destroys families & individuals, especially when the anger & rage go unchecked for years as it did with Jan Michael Vincent's character toward the end of the movie.  The poor guy should have gotten some help with all he was having to deal with, but they just basically kept him in an orphanage until he was old enough to leave & he had to deal with all that stuff on his own.  Not a good combination.  All in all, it was a good movie.",1353715200,4,571,4.349056603773585
