7242366,5,B00YSBFH8C,I've been watching this from day #1.  It's the best!!,1441324800,,53,4.3
7242367,5,B00YSBFH8C,love this  show,1441238400,,15,4.0
7242368,5,B00YSBFH8C,"I love it, I love it....i have seasons 1 thru 9 & I ordered 10. I love and have always loved how Hotchner life was played out, he lost Haley, yet he has to raise Jack how she mostly raised him, alone! I hated the seperation between them, yet his life has changed for the good because i felt like he should of balanced his life out more. Now his character w/Beth is more of balance w/his personal life and his work but, she seems to work as hard as Hotch does. I guess that's good!!!! As for Morgan, I just thought the grand shocker would be for him and Garica to finally be together as a real couple. I love them both because they make me guess all the time about how their relationship really will turn out. Garcia should of never got w/Kevin, because he took the fun outta of her character and Sam...well I guess he's ok but, don't see as much of him with her so, its like she is alone! Morgan, should be the one married w/a kid on the way because his character has been thru alot w/little real relationship value. JJ is a KEEPER 4EVER! She is the gkue of the team fir real and losing her made me upset!!! Now that she's back makes the team hole again. I would rather see Emily back instead of trying to replace her w/Jennifer! No one can replace Emily!!!! Words cant express how she brings a unique style to the team as a hole. She should be in a relationship w/ the handsome, hand full, British FBI Agent from the other Criminal Minds. I also would like to comment on that....LET IT GO!!! There's no replacement of any kind and Garcia cant work w/them!!! She don't fix!!!! Its like putting Unnamed Brand Mayo into a Miracle Whip can!!! I will taste the difference!!! Back to Emily; if she continue to run the other office at least allow the teams to work a few cases together so, we can see her act as the Head. I also believr Emily should have a shot at a real relationship. Everyone should on the team or it seems as if their characters will die from working too much! Reid.....oh where do i begin....i hate how he lost Mave!!! FIND HIM A NERD, HE WANTS KIDS SOME DAY SO, LETS GET HIM INTO A RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL NOT RESULT IN HIM TALKING FOR MONTHS ON THE PHONE BEFORE MEETING HER....HE DESERVES A LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE BAU!!!! I hate how people are speaking on Rossi's character.....He is awesome and the daughter is a plus!!! He spoke w/Hotch before about if hexhad a kid orckids, how his life would of turned out differently and how he would of worked harder for his marriage. His wife's have died (2 of them) and he was alone so surfacing a family for him was not expected but, it was a Plus!!! Now he has a family and grandson... Look at how JJ's character turned out when she married and when Henry came! She is complete and still able to work!  I love how her life is on the show and how we see Henry at time and Will! That need to happen for Morgan, Emily, Reid and Garcia!!!! Please make more seasons....I watch the ones, i have over and over!!!! I believe Criminal Minds is so loved because the characters are a family, they work together inspite of their differences and most of all.....THE CHARACTERS STAY THE SAME!!! THAT IS A PLUS!!!!",1441238400,,3155,4.275919732441472
7242369,4,B00YSBFH8C,"Not A 5 in my opinion.  Rossi long lost child surfaces. This was NOT a thought out addition as well as not adding anything to overall series.
Law enforcement ""kinds"" are normally more aware of their actions and the possible results of relationships.  He accepts this person without evidentiary proof.  No law enforcement person would do this.  This series started without a lot of the characters personal lives  in the story and it was good that way.  Bringing a long lost adult child to a ""world renown FBI profiler"" and his automatic acceptance says little about this man's judgment or skills as a top law enforcement thinker.  It undermines the FBI character, the mother and her daughter.  This move does NOT advance the series in any positive way.  It is really too unrealistic to believe a man with an above average intelligence would be a sucker for someone saying she is his daughter not to mention she immediately calls him dad and is present as support for a funeral he attends as if she had been his daughter all along.  No.  It does not flow.  This is just so unrealistic and it just does NOT ""fit.""
Jennifer Love  Hewitt did a good job in a role  not suited to her.  She did a good job though, a plus for her acting skills.
I have kept up with this series since series 1 and I really like it but have to say I am disappointed with season 10. The plots are good and executed  well.  Maybe 10 seasons are enough for me.",1440979200,4,1429,4.413793103448276

7242372,5,B00YSBFH8C,"I so love this show, I have been a fan from day one. It has been a great ride for the last 10 years, and I hope that it last for 10 more! Personally  Knowing the designer for  Penelope Garcia's  hair accessories created by my friend  "" The Hair Bow Diva "" has made watching the show that much better from week to week, I cant wait to see what she has  for Penelope Garcia  in season 11 !  It is fun re-watching the complete season 10 tthat way I am ready for the roller coaster ride for season 11!",1440547200,4,497,3.91

7242374,5,B00YSBFH8C,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Criminal Minds! This is one of my favorite shows and season 10 was not a let-down! Can't wait to see who joins the cast next and what happens each week. Wish so much love to see Padget return as Printess!",1438905600,12,221,4.162790697674419
7242375,5,B00YSBFH8C,"Ten seasons in, ""Criminal Minds"" keeps it interesting with a new main character and some strong scripts.  Jennifer Love Hewitt joins the cast as Kate Callahan, a former undercover agent with a challenging family life.  Former profiler Gideon makes a reappearance (sort of) when an old case resurfaces, one in which he and David Rossi launched the BAU many years ago.  JJ Jareau faces a personal and professional crisis over lingering PTSD from her deployment to the Middle East in an earlier season. Team leader Aaron Hotchner will have to face down his former father-in-law (played by Ed Asner in a superb guest role), now suffering from Alzheimer's.  In addition, in a truly horrifying episode, Hotchner will fall prey to a mysterious villain who manipulates people into committing murder.  Derek Morgan will have to come to a meeting of the minds with his girlfriend on their relationship in the midst of a difficult case.  And these are just a few sample episodes.

Criminal Minds continues to be a gritty, tough crime procedural, sometimes tough to watch.  The good guys don't always win, and the bad guys can be pretty scary.  The show continues to put out a high quality product, and has been renewed for an eleventh season.  Season Ten is recommended to fans of the series.",1435708800,47,1281,4.861751152073733

7242466,5,B00YSBFH8C,"I bought the entire series of Crimial Minds because I so enjoy the series.  The series is not too gory, but I enjoy following the deductive reasoning and the professional performance of the ""staff"".  Unfornately the media has reared its ugly head (i will not name names, see reports for info), one actor ""just left"", another left to move onto another series, another was fired post conflict with new writer/producer, two other are suing for equal pay with male actors, etc. I opted to strike while the ""iron is hot"" and grab the videos of this wonderful series while they are available.",1496016000,2,586,4.735294117647059

7242472,5,B00YSBFH8C,"I have watched and loved Criminal Minds since it's frst season; like other fans I have put up with cast changes and acepted them because the story lines stayed true to the shows original conept of hunting psycho's.....untill SEASON 12. There are many reasons to hate SEASON 12; the obvious absences of Thomas Gibson (I don't care what he did or didn''t do to a writter, he was worth keeping) and Shemar Moore (I'm ok with him leaveing to do other things with his life and his replacement is awesome) but the real drag down of the show is them trying to do something different with the REID prison story line which only serves to make HALF a criminal minds show each night as they fade to Reid in prison distracing from the nights respective psycho gipping the viewers/fan. It's terrible and not worth my time not waste my time. Even the name on Reids arm ""Rosa Medina"" an anogram ""Nadie Ramos"" shows how lazy they are...that they are not even trying here.  To add insult to injury Reid's pirson attitude is so unbareably nieve fo his I.Q. even his social skills, It's all just so insulting. Bye Bye Criminal Minds I will miss you.",1490140800,,1130,4.512195121951219

Season 10 was much more poignant. I was moved to tears on a few occasions. I was also creeped out, grossed out, and made hopeful for the future for some of my favorite characters. I could have gone into detail about particular episodes, but for the true Criminal Minds aficionado the writers and producers did wonderful jobs, Except for a casing change that I didn't particularly like, but she may be great for others. Just not my cup of tea. I saw too much inconsistency. But this person did not detract from my overall enjoyment of Season 10. Can't wait to buy Season 11.

No one every imagined they'd be uncovering the death/murder of one of their closest friends and colleges.  Immediately I knew who it was and tears rolled down my face.  After 10 season you fall in love with all of these characters as if they are real people.  You can't help be cry with them.  I still hope that they will bring back another season some where down the road.  A season 11 and so many more at some point even if not all of them come back.  I do hope my Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) comes back.  I will miss her the most.  She is totally awesome in her computer knowledge and how she chooses to see the world around her.  I love her heart.  Great cast that I will miss so many more of the cast as well.  When you are involved so much in a long series like this you can't help but feel a sence of loss when they decide to end a series.

The stories surrounding the characters are up to their usual standard and quite enjoyable but what is missing is the cut and thrust of a proper investigation with all its attendant gory and grisliness.

There must have been a change in writers or the writers are experiencing a brain fog. The writing was not up to the past seasons. During every episode I was left questioning....there was no continuity....no fluid transition of storyline. What there was? A lot of jumping from one thought to the next with no connecting storyline as in seasons past.
Conclusions jumped to with no show of how they got there or even got started there.
In short--season 10 was a HUGH  disappointment after watching 1-9. The only redeeming episode would have been the death of a former SSA agent--but even that episode was difficult to follow in the beginning.",1444694400,,877,4.7254901960784315

7243028,5,B00YSBFH8C,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

With each passing season of this series we witness some of the most brutal and despicable crimes known to man. So why the fascination? Well for one thing were safe in our homes watching something we only hear about. There is also the fact that for the most part our heroes always catch the bad guy or do him/her in. Thats a comforting feeling. For myself the best part of this series is knowing that there actually is a BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) out there doing their best to protect us.

When you couple this with a talented group of individuals who make up a substantial whole the end result is an entertaining series that both frightens us and draws us in. It frightens us because were afraid, and should be afraid, of the types of criminals we see in the show. It draws us in because we become familiar with the characters, our heroes, as if they are now a part of the family. As time goes by and a series goes on, we get even closer to these characters. This is season 10 of this show and by now we truly feel as if we know these characters.

But as series tend to move forward, especially in an ensemble cast, the occasional actor decides to leave. This series has had several losses. The first was Mandy Patinkin whose character was eventually killed off. Then Paget Brewster left, apparently dead but later found alive and well and on the run. Two seasons ago the FBI head of the department Strauss was killed. A new character was brought in with that year in the form of Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn) but she left last year to be replaced this season by Jennifer Love Hewitt as Kate Callahan, a decorated police officer recruited for the unit. The cast may change but as a fan of the show I can tell you that the loss of one of these characters always feels like a personal loss. The addition of new members always feels like welcoming someone into the fold.

Thats perhaps the greatest thing about this series, the interaction between the main characters with one another. They feel like one big happy family. They have personal problems that they share with one another. They care about what happens among themselves. When one of them is attacked youve attacked the entire group. And the fans feel the same way. Attack one of these characters and youve brought on the wrath of fans across the country. It may seem odd but thats how dedicated theyve become.

This is all important to know when watching this season. Its not just about the killers or terrorists involved, its more about the team and how they work together, how they watch each others backs. The introduction of a new character like Kate Callahan is a tenuous situation at best until we grow to welcome her into the fold. Thank goodness Hewitt was up to the task and before the season ended we grew to think of her as one of the family.

The season took on the usual casts of characters focusing mostly on the serial killers or murderers that popped up across the country. Social media was tackled this season.  Missing children was another case where the abducted children were held for years. Religious cults were a topic. Its the variety of cases, of suspects that make this show continued watching for ten seasons. Had it remained focused only on serial killers then it might have languished alongside other shows from the past. By keeping it up to date, by drawing in topics of the day without over politicizing them, it has made it a show worth watching from week to week, year to year.

The personal touch also came to the front on several episodes this year. We got to meet Rossis (Joe Mantegna) daughter. The season ended with a storyline that had developed over the entire season involving Kates niece who she adopted being abducted by sex traffickers using social media to disguise themselves. It was a tense episode that also, hopefully, brought to attention the fact that parents need to focus on their kids use of social media and that even if they think they have it covered they need to dig deeper.

As the season ended it just made the same thing happen that happens at the end of each season of this series. It made us sit back, take a breath and wonder when the next season would begin again. If you're wondering its September 30th. Until then we can sit back and enjoy the box set of season 10. Better yet go back and start with season one to work your way through to this point. The series still offers some of the best acting on television as well as stories that will keep you guessing until the end credits roll.",1443484800,,4574,4.494584837545126

7243063,5,B00YSBFH8C,Criminal Minds was excellent this season because it had Jennifer Love Hewitt. She was very good as Agent Kate Callahan. My favorite episode this year was about Gideon's death and the flashbacks about how Gideon and Rossi first started out as FBI agents.,1442448000,3,253,4.906976744186046

7243065,5,B00YSBFH8C,"I think I like this better than Season 9.  I love J.L.H.'S Character and hope she remains with the B.A.U.  Although a little quick, I'm glad Rossi had a second chance at Fatherhood with a Grandchild to boot.  Against another comment posted, I would love to see MORE of Garcia.  She adds a little Comic Relief to the show which is refreshing.  All the Characters seem like 'Fine Wine.'  Looking forward to next Season.",1442102400,10,417,4.5675675675675675
