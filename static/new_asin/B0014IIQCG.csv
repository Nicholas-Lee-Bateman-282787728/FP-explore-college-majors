3133232,4,B0014IIQCG,"Saw this two years ago @ Seattle Film Fest (where it won at least one award) and was fascinated, since my previous experience w/ big rigs was from my college hitch hiking days in the mid'70s.  What a fresh insight this doc is, and everyone who ever has to share hiways w/ 18 wheelers should see it.

I've been waiting not so patiently for its release, and am glad it's available here. But, really, please make DVDs available so I can purchase a heap to give to friends.  No, I'm not a big rig driver, just enjoy this slice of life, and the ""film making"" aspect was above my expectations.",1259193600,,587,4.318181818181818
3133233,4,B0014IIQCG,"While long-haul trucks may seem pretty much all the same as you drive along with them on the highway, it's probably impossible for a documentary to capture the vast variety of men and women who travel in them and deliver much of what is bought and sold in America. Nevertheless, this film does a lot to illuminate its subject, letting us get a glimpse into the daily lives of truck drivers from coast to coast, by letting them talk about what they do for a living.

The film gives the impression that truckers perceive themselves as marginalized and under-appreciated. Many also seem to feel they are the last bastion of American values in a country gone haywire. On the other hand, when a woman driver describes using a taser to defend herself against assailants at a truck stop, you realize that truckers are regularly exposed to a seamier, dangerous underside of a national distribution system that's visible to consumers only at the end point - the shelves of their favorite discount store or supermarket.

The filmmakers follow truckers over routes throughout the Eastern half of the country, with a few side trips in the West, skimming down the left coast in the closing minutes and just barely getting into California - with a Polish trucker whose enthusiasm for American life contrasts significantly with the dourer grumblings of earlier drivers whose view from the cab of their trucks is often a jaundiced one.

I liked this film, learned a lot, and will remember it for a long time as I regularly drive the interstate and join the fleets of 18-wheelers endlessly moving across the landscape in both directions.",1258502400,11,1620,4.84115523465704
3133234,3,B0014IIQCG,"It should have been stressed more that the trucking industry does not receive the respect it deserves from the general public. More and more city ordinances are going after the trucks for all of their air pollution problems, 4 wheelers don't want to share the road, filthy truckstop bathrooms/restaurants and let's be real here, please, when was the last time you saw a beautiful&friendly clerk greeting you when you come thru those truckstop doors?

3133235,5,B0014IIQCG,"BigRig is a beautiful Documentary movie packed with special features on Life on the road for a trucker, while sadly there could have been more, there is plenty interviews and a overall good look into the life on the road, I have always respected truckers and Have Loved Big Rigs. This movie is good.",1240876800,,299,4.555555555555555
3133236,4,B0014IIQCG,"We see them everyday and probably curse them just as much. But Big Rig digs deep into this American subculture and puts a human face on it. Like most of Doug Pray's films (Scratch, Surfwise, Infamy), he makes you understand what's behind the common misconceptions of truckers, so you can come to appreciate their contributions to our daily lives. Unexpectedly entertaining and enlightening at the same time. Highly recommended.",1240185600,,427,5.202898550724638
3133237,5,B0014IIQCG,"This film highlights the stories of professional truck drivers who transport everything from groceries to hospital equipment across America's highways and, in the process, support the livelihood that the rest of us maintain. Director Doug Pray pulls off an outstanding job of portraying his subjects as respectable, hard-working, and passionate individuals who are dedicated to their service and career. I love his work! He has so much passion for his characters!",1219276800,,463,5.535211267605634
3133238,3,B0014IIQCG,"As a professional driver of 17 years with more than 2,000,000 miles on the road, I looked forward to this documentary with great anticipation.  I must say it was not what I thought it would be and it disapointed me quite a bit.  I had wanted and expected something that I could show my family and friends to help them understand my life as a professional long-haul driver over the past 17 years. The only advertisements I saw for this video were in the different professional industry journals such as, Trucker's News, and these ads implied that this documentary would let the viewer know what life on the road was really like for the over-the-road trucker.  This video most decidedly does not do that.  It does focus on and give an honest view of some aspects of the typical driver's daily life on the road, however; the video spends far more time interviewing a handful of drivers who discuss their personal problems and how they handle them on the road, and/or they tell the viewer how they got into the business in the first place.  This video never really addresses the true hardships, such as being gone from home 320 days or more a year, the often very stressful timelines professional drivers work with, or many of the other facets of the business that regularly confront the average over-the-road driver.  This documentary really narrowed the scope and range of country in which they shot their video, it was mostly in the south, and it did not portray or even really attempt to give an accurate picture of the trucker's daily life as we do our part to keep the wheels of our nation's economy rolling.  I give it 3 stars only because some of the truckstop footage was really good and I am trying hard to be nice.  From a trucker's perspective however, this video never comes close to meeting its intended purpose.",1217289600,68,1822,4.6191950464396285
3133239,5,B0014IIQCG,As the daughter of a long haul trucker this film hit close to home.  I spent most of my childhood out on the road and this is one film that got it right.  It helps to abolish all those stereotypes associated with most trucker.  They are a huge piece of American culture and should be looked up to for the sacrifices they make to get the loads delivered!

3133268,4,B0014IIQCG,This film was very informative and gave me a greater understanding of what truckers are dealing with when they are hauling freight across America.  We saw many real drivers and their lives being truckers.  Interviews with them provided interesting insight on how they see American culture.  All the drivers came from different backgrounds and experiences.  Many have been driving for years.  I also enjoyed seeing the roads and hiways of America.,1394928000,,446,5.225352112676056
3133269,5,B0014IIQCG,"I love this movie. It gives people a tiny glimpse of the life of a trucker. It's hard work and long hours, and without these people you wouldn't be reading this. Everything you use or eat is delivered by a trucker. Try to remember that the next time you start to cut off a truck. They're not going to work or joy riding. They're out there delivering everything we need to survive. And this movie lets you ride along for a while. Enjoy. Oh and the next time you get a chance, thank a trucker; not just for bringing you all your s*** but for looking out for you on the highways.",1394323200,,576,4.151785714285714

3133275,5,B0014IIQCG,"Saw on Netflix enjoyed it thoroughly.  Even went directly to the production company website (now inactive). Was able to get in contact with them through email and was told the movie wasn't being published anymore. Happy to find it on Amazon and to add it to my documentary collection.

The story is limited to following 4 long haul truck drivers and not a true documentary about truck driving. However, the drivers in this movie do tell of their experiences while doing long haul trucking. There is no narrator or Q/A session constantly interrupting, it's a camera in their truck most of the time while they're driving and telling of there experiences, that's it The camera follows them to truckstops, etc....

I rate it 5 stars because the stories the drivers tell of their experiences are enjoyable and the film style of this documentary is great as is the music. If there had been a narrator or stupid ""cut to interview"" scene (like reality TV) this would be unwatchable. Sometimes documentaries are good with narrators / Q & A sessions/ and sometimes they are better with neither. Ocule Films did a good job I think in making this film.

UPDATE!! I received the movie and watched it again. Lots of extras on this dvd including a wonderful music video, ""Wicked and Weird"" by Buck 65. It's the music video for the song that is the main background song to the dvd. Buck 65 also has albums here on Amazon.",1389052800,2,1405,4.653225806451613

3133277,2,B0014IIQCG,"Too much time spent on the personal issues of a few truckers, the information on trucking income was superficial, and the DVD lacked coverage of the real stressors of trucking with some companies - eg. waiting for a load, assignments w/o sufficient completion times, poorly maintained equipment, delays in payment - even short-paying drivers, loading/unloading delays (I just did some Shamrock Dairy loads that required 7 hours, 4.5 hours, and 2 hours to load or unload), snow/ice, driving all night or w/o enough rest because of loading and unloading delays, lack of health insurance, vacation, or even workman's compensation. On the other hand, some trucking jobs are much, much better - eg. at UPS, FedEx, and Yellow. And with enough flexibility and time, it can be a wonderful way to see the U.S.A.",1385164800,,802,5.037593984962406
3133278,3,B0014IIQCG,"The filmography was great, storylines were good, 'character' development good, but I left feeling too little of the 'trucking life' was left uncovered.  Likewise, there was no discussion of the industry; what works, what doesn't and what needs to change.  My primary complaint is that they leave the viewer with the impression that truckers are whiners, which I don't believe to be accurate.  I believe that portrayal is unintentional, but when you edit out everything except the complaints, it appears that's all they do; complain.  I realize film makers strive to develop antagonists in an attempt to envelop empathy with the viewer, but I feel they went too far in this film.  Still, if your intrigued about the life of a truck driver, this is worth the viewing.",1381449600,,765,4.9453125

So, do you want to know what these people think, or would you rather know what they do and how the business of trucking (or the awesome trucks themselves) function--beyond consuming fuel that costs too much.

3133294,5,B0014IIQCG,"OK, who cares how long you've been trucking? I drove OTR for a short while, and just didn't find it to be satisfying or worth the pennies I was earning. The truth is you're overworked, and many companies will force you to cheat on your logs. TRUTH! That's not what this movie is about.
This movie is very well put together. The producers hung out in truckstops asking truckers if they could join and film them. Personally, I'd think it was a setup, and I'd say ""Are you crazy?""
More than anything, this movie is about personalities of truckers. As you go through the movie, you'll say to yourself, I'd like to work with this driver or that driver in a team situation etc. There are many different personalities, and I think the producers possibly asked them political questions just to see where they stood on different issues. Many drivers felt they were under too much government control, while the Russian driver enjoyed trucking because he was free. There is a trucker who has his son in the Middle East, and shows the harsh realities of American life, and what he must be thinking while he's driving. There are fun truckers who live to put chrome on their trucks. There is a trucker who brings his dogs along, and a husband and wife who drive together, and a husband and wife that drive in separate trucks. There is a trucker who shares a detailed story about his near death experience while driving. This movie is about truckers and mostly about their stories. BOTTOMLINE!
 I've seen this movie over 10 times, and would like to say that it's a beautiful movie and has a lot of unknown (made for the movie) great fitting songs placed throughout the movie with awesome shots of sunrise/sunset (and just realistic footage) throughout our country. If you enjoy listening to people(truckers) while they are driving an 18 wheeler with nice music and beautiful cinematography, you'll enjoy this movie. It's a lot better than a lot of the reviews are giving it credit for. Most likely, you'll find it entertaining and enjoyable. Since I bought this movie the first day it came out, I'd like to ask the producers if they would make another one, and this time on Blu-Ray. If you want to show off your high-def digital system, this is also a great movie.",1330214400,,2249,4.636591478696742
3133295,1,B0014IIQCG,"Greetings.

My father was a Michigan trucker for one of those smaller distributors later acquired for the trucks and warehouse and other assets by a much larger distributor which then whacked most of the smaller firm's people to unemployment.  My father placed me behind his rig's steering wheel for a stretch of road along Lake Huron on a clear day when I was age 14, to step me through the gears of his rig, then to pull in to the next delivery stop.  Interesting experience, yet when I chose a career at age 15 I chose practical electricity, and I am today a 76 years old journeyman electrician with 60 years in the trade and other education.

Attempting to view the Free! to Amazon Prime subscribers (I highly recommend Amazon Prime) film Big Rig is painful.  Semi-literate men and women complaining about the state of their protective nation, the USA.

Drive it or leave it.  The warming arctic employs big rig truckers, while paying triple wages (though with no unions or medical plans).  Check it out.

Easy to do, as the TV show IRT displays.

Oh, and.  Amazon presents an excellent selection of truckin' music CDs, which I have.

3133296,2,B0014IIQCG,"As an employee for a Landstar dispatching agency, I have come to love drivers.  I was looking for a video that would help me see the ins and outs of their side of the equation.  This film had very little of that.  If I didn't know so many drivers personally, this video would have left me with the impression that one has to have a messed up past, a severe dissatisfaction with the government, or a willingness to sleep with hookers to be a driver.  As a flag-waving american who doesn't consider his past to be a total mess, this movie left me with the impression that truck driving is just not for me.  The attempt was obviously to gain sympathy for drivers, to put a human side on a society that is sort of labeled as a commodity rather than people.  If I didn't know better, I'd walk away thinking all drivers hate the government and have been divorced multiple times.  Definitely did not like this approach.",1325894400,,912,4.392857142857143

The concept an execution of the project was great. The filmmakers captured a great cross-section of truckers, whom are known to vary greatly. One of the common threads: The economy goes NOWHERE without trucks. If you bought it, a truck brought it!",1267660800,2,382,4.803030303030303
3133300,4,B0014IIQCG,"I did not have high expectations for Big Rig, but the film was a pleasant surprise. The truckers in the film reflect on their lives on the road and on what they have learned about America. Viewers get to see averages Joes (and Janes) tell us what they have learned from their lives on the road.

One of the interviewees reflects that truck drivers are the closest thing that we have to modern-day cowboys; drivers lead transitory lives away from home and family in order to keep our economy moving.  By travelling across the U.S., drivers have a chance to see the good and the bad in our society. The drivers featured in Big Rig consistently express a strong dislike for the U.S. Government and its heavy regulation of the trucking industry. One of the few female drivers speaks of the danger and sexism that she encounters on a regular basis; she says that, in spite of the challenges, she loves driving a truck.

One great aspect of the film is the beautiful cinematography. The filmmakers did a spectacular job of shooting America ""from sea to shining sea."" Critics often contend that the interstate highway system is a boring way to see America; the visuals in Big Rig constitute a nice counterargument. Big Rig also has a great soundtrack. The songs are by a Canadian who calls himself Buck 65; his songs are a mixture of country and hip hop; I promise that it is better than one would think.

Watching Big Rig made me think that, perhaps, one of the best ways to ""find"" America would be to work as a trucker for a few years. I recommend the film.",1260662400,8,1552,4.512455516014235

What a fresh insight this doc is, and everyone who ever has to share hiways w/ 18 wheelers should see it.

I've been waiting not so patiently for its release, and am glad it's available here. But, really, please make DVDs available so I can purchase a heap to give to friends.  No, I'm not a big rig driver, just enjoy this slice of life, and the ""film making"" aspect was above my expectations.",1259193600,,587,4.318181818181818
3367730,4,B0014IIQCG,"While long-haul trucks may seem pretty much all the same as you drive along with them on the highway, it's probably impossible for a documentary to capture the vast variety of men and women who travel in them and deliver much of what is bought and sold in America. Nevertheless, this film does a lot to illuminate its subject, letting us get a glimpse into the daily lives of truck drivers from coast to coast, by letting them talk about what they do for a living.

The film gives the impression that truckers perceive themselves as marginalized and under-appreciated. Many also seem to feel they are the last bastion of American values in a country gone haywire. On the other hand, when a woman driver describes using a taser to defend herself against assailants at a truck stop, you realize that truckers are regularly exposed to a seamier, dangerous underside of a national distribution system that's visible to consumers only at the end point - the shelves of their favorite discount store or supermarket.

The filmmakers follow truckers over routes throughout the Eastern half of the country, with a few side trips in the West, skimming down the left coast in the closing minutes and just barely getting into California - with a Polish trucker whose enthusiasm for American life contrasts significantly with the dourer grumblings of earlier drivers whose view from the cab of their trucks is often a jaundiced one.

I liked this film, learned a lot, and will remember it for a long time as I regularly drive the interstate and join the fleets of 18-wheelers endlessly moving across the landscape in both directions.",1258502400,11,1620,4.84115523465704

3367735,3,B0014IIQCG,"As a professional driver of 17 years with more than 2,000,000 miles on the road, I looked forward to this documentary with great anticipation.  I must say it was not what I thought it would be and it disapointed me quite a bit.  I had wanted and expected something that I could show my family and friends to help them understand my life as a professional long-haul driver over the past 17 years. The only advertisements I saw for this video were in the different professional industry journals such as, Trucker's News, and these ads implied that this documentary would let the viewer know what life on the road was really like for the over-the-road trucker.  This video most decidedly does not do that.  It does focus on and give an honest view of some aspects of the typical driver's daily life on the road, however; the video spends far more time interviewing a handful of drivers who discuss their personal problems and how they handle them on the road, and/or they tell the viewer how they got into the business in the first place.  This video never really addresses the true hardships, such as being gone from home 320 days or more a year, the often very stressful timelines professional drivers work with, or many of the other facets of the business that regularly confront the average over-the-road driver.  This documentary really narrowed the scope and range of country in which they shot their video, it was mostly in the south, and it did not portray or even really attempt to give an accurate picture of the trucker's daily life as we do our part to keep the wheels of our nation's economy rolling.  I give it 3 stars only because some of the truckstop footage was really good and I am trying hard to be nice.  From a trucker's perspective however, this video never comes close to meeting its intended purpose.",1217289600,68,1822,4.6191950464396285

Was able to get in contact with them through email and was told the movie wasn't being published anymore. Happy to find it on Amazon and to add it to my documentary collection.

The story is limited to following 4 long haul truck drivers and not a true documentary about truck driving. However, the drivers in this movie do tell of their experiences while doing long haul trucking. There is no narrator or Q/A session constantly interrupting, it's a camera in their truck most of the time while they're driving and telling of there experiences, that's it The camera follows them to truckstops, etc....

I rate it 5 stars because the stories the drivers tell of their experiences are enjoyable and the film style of this documentary is great as is the music. If there had been a narrator or stupid ""cut to interview"" scene (like reality TV) this would be unwatchable. Sometimes documentaries are good with narrators / Q & A sessions/ and sometimes they are better with neither. Ocule Films did a good job I think in making this film.

UPDATE!! I received the movie and watched it again. Lots of extras on this dvd including a wonderful music video, ""Wicked and Weird"" by Buck 65.

I believe that portrayal is unintentional, but when you edit out everything except the complaints, it appears that's all they do; complain.

This movie is very well put together. The producers hung out in truckstops asking truckers if they could join and film them. Personally, I'd think it was a setup, and I'd say ""Are you crazy?""
More than anything, this movie is about personalities of truckers. As you go through the movie, you'll say to yourself, I'd like to work with this driver or that driver in a team situation etc. There are many different personalities, and I think the producers possibly asked them political questions just to see where they stood on different issues. Many drivers felt they were under too much government control, while the Russian driver enjoyed trucking because he was free. There is a trucker who has his son in the Middle East, and shows the harsh realities of American life, and what he must be thinking while he's driving. There are fun truckers who live to put chrome on their trucks. There is a trucker who brings his dogs along, and a husband and wife who drive together, and a husband and wife that drive in separate trucks. There is a trucker who shares a detailed story about his near death experience while driving. This movie is about truckers and mostly about their stories. BOTTOMLINE!
 I've seen this movie over 10 times, and would like to say that it's a beautiful movie and has a lot of unknown (made for the movie) great fitting songs placed throughout the movie with awesome shots of sunrise/sunset (and just realistic footage) throughout our country. If you enjoy listening to people(truckers) while they are driving an 18 wheeler with nice music and beautiful cinematography, you'll enjoy this movie. It's a lot better than a lot of the reviews are giving it credit for. Most likely, you'll find it entertaining and enjoyable. Since I bought this movie the first day it came out, I'd like to ask the producers if they would make another one, and this time on Blu-Ray. If you want to show off your high-def digital system, this is also a great movie.",1330214400,,2249,4.636591478696742

My father was a Michigan trucker for one of those smaller distributors later acquired for the trucks and warehouse and other assets by a much larger distributor which then whacked most of the smaller firm's people to unemployment.  My father placed me behind his rig's steering wheel for a stretch of road along Lake Huron on a clear day when I was age 14, to step me through the gears of his rig, then to pull in to the next delivery stop.  Interesting experience, yet when I chose a career at age 15 I chose practical electricity, and I am today a 76 years old journeyman electrician with 60 years in the trade and other education.

Attempting to view the Free! to Amazon Prime subscribers (I highly recommend Amazon Prime) film Big Rig is painful.  Semi-literate men and women complaining about the state of their protective nation, the USA.

Drive it or leave it.  The warming arctic employs big rig truckers, while paying triple wages (though with no unions or medical plans).  Check it out.

Easy to do, as the TV show IRT displays.

Oh, and.  Amazon presents an excellent selection of truckin' music CDs, which I have.

""Big wheels rollin', big wheels rollin', movin' on...""  Glory days.  Do we got us a convoy!

3367793,2,B0014IIQCG,"As an employee for a Landstar dispatching agency, I have come to love drivers.  I was looking for a video that would help me see the ins and outs of their side of the equation.  This film had very little of that.  If I didn't know so many drivers personally, this video would have left me with the impression that one has to have a messed up past, a severe dissatisfaction with the government, or a willingness to sleep with hookers to be a driver.  As a flag-waving american who doesn't consider his past to be a total mess, this movie left me with the impression that truck driving is just not for me.  The attempt was obviously to gain sympathy for drivers, to put a human side on a society that is sort of labeled as a commodity rather than people.  If I didn't know better, I'd walk away thinking all drivers hate the government and have been divorced multiple times.  Definitely did not like this approach.",1325894400,,912,4.392857142857143

can get a slight glimpse into the truckers lives;that they are just regular
citizens out there making a living.
 perhaps the next movie will go into the problems truckers have with such things as regulatory changes, lumpers, shipping rates, etc.,etc.
 i enjoyed this one.",1278806400,,348,4.864406779661017
3367796,5,B0014IIQCG,"This was an excellent documentary of the people in the trucking industry as well as the importance of that industry to the US economy. The concept an execution of the project was great. The filmmakers captured a great cross-section of truckers, whom are known to vary greatly. One of the common threads: The economy goes NOWHERE without trucks. If you bought it, a truck brought it!",1267660800,2,382,4.803030303030303
3367797,4,B0014IIQCG,"I did not have high expectations for Big Rig, but the film was a pleasant surprise. The truckers in the film reflect on their lives on the road and on what they have learned about America. Viewers get to see averages Joes (and Janes) tell us what they have learned from their lives on the road.

One of the interviewees reflects that truck drivers are the closest thing that we have to modern-day cowboys; drivers lead transitory lives away from home and family in order to keep our economy moving.  By travelling across the U.S., drivers have a chance to see the good and the bad in our society. The drivers featured in Big Rig consistently express a strong dislike for the U.S. Government and its heavy regulation of the trucking industry. One of the few female drivers speaks of the danger and sexism that she encounters on a regular basis; she says that, in spite of the challenges, she loves driving a truck.

One great aspect of the film is the beautiful cinematography. The filmmakers did a spectacular job of shooting America ""from sea to shining sea."" Critics often contend that the interstate highway system is a boring way to see America; the visuals in Big Rig constitute a nice counterargument. Big Rig also has a great soundtrack. The songs are by a Canadian who calls himself Buck 65; his songs are a mixture of country and hip hop; I promise that it is better than one would think.

Watching Big Rig made me think that, perhaps, one of the best ways to ""find"" America would be to work as a trucker for a few years. I recommend the film.",1260662400,8,1552,4.512455516014235
