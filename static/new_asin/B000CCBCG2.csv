8097144,5,B000CCBCG2,The Lazytown dvd arrived a few days after ordering. My granddaughter loves to watch Lazytown season 2 on Netflix so now she has been enjoying watching this dvd.,1391558400,2,160,4.75
8097145,5,B000CCBCG2,"okay, so, first of all, I would just like to say that I used to HATE this show when I first saw it cause I thought it was really strange but my daughter, even though she was so young (6 months old, maybe younger), always loved it. she's almost 2 now & she still loves it, I think mainly because A- Sportacus looks like her dad & B- she likes to sing & dance, naturally, so of course she's gonna love anything she can sing & dance TO. so anyway, I have to admit that I, too, LOVE this show. mainly because Magns Scheving (Sportacus), seriously, is SOOO HOTT! & that's the main reason why I like it, ntm, some of the things that Robbie & Stingy say or do on the show can be funny & some of the songs on certain episodes are good, for a kid's show. I just bought this DVD (& another: Welcome to LazyTown) today, so I haven't received them, yet. I'm very excited to, especially because 'Defeeted' is an episode on it, as stated in a review, & I, personally, think that's the best episode that Magns Scheving made of LazyTown. I would also love to get the ""Sportacus on the Move"" DVD, too, so hopefully Amazon will sell it soon.",1370649600,,1123,4.155963302752293
8097146,3,B000CCBCG2,"I brought the Nick Jr dvd that showed 1 episode of Lazytown and my 2 y/o daughter fell in love.  She asks me to play almost every morning so of course I would buy a full dvd of Lazytown.  Well, she watched it once but now she cries as soon as I mention it.  I'm not sure what happened but I must of overdosed her on Lazytown.  I'm hoping as she gets older, she will start to like it more.",1320969600,2,388,3.8125
8097147,5,B000CCBCG2,"Robbie rocks! He is the coolest bad guy around. We give him four stars.
Sportacus and Stephanie:
sports candy = fruits and vegetables (better than ""real food"" which is what we called these two before)
junk food or healthy food: the prince and princess toss out this query before we eat anything
""let's go play and exercise first"" = anything that encourages mine to say this gets two thumbs up from me
Such a wonderful show with a nice Icelandic touch. How can we go wrong?",1235692800,2,472,4.5
8097148,5,B000CCBCG2,This is a great series.  My daughter really enjoys it.  Don't know why it went off the air.,1232409600,2,91,4.0
8097149,5,B000CCBCG2,"My 4-year-old loves LazyTown, and it is one of the few CD's I allow him to watch without me. The stories are simple but convey the old message: Get moving, don't eat too many sweets, get enough sleep, stick together as a team... yet the animation is young and colorful and positive. Cool music, too!",1167782400,5,299,4.454545454545454
8097150,5,B000CCBCG2,"The best of the three Lazytown DVDs released to date, this one showcases loveable villain Robbie Rotten (Stefn Karl Stefnsson, an Icelandic film and stage actor), and has some of the best songs of the series so far.  Stefnsson is a master of making faces, and would easily outmug Jim Carrey in a ""face off.""

Episode one:  Sportacus is once again chosen to win the Person of the Year Award, much to Robbie's disgust.  To prevent this, Robbie brings out the heavy artillery, including some of his best inventions and a cow costume.  There is a sub-plot of a variation of the ""boy who cried wolf"", when Ziggy's fibs backfire on him.

Great song: Master of Disguise

Episode two: It's time to play Pirates as Rottenbeard appears just in time to lead the children on a treasure hunt for the missing piece of the Lazytown Stone with the ""secret to living"".  (Robbie looks amazingly cute in his pirate costume.)  Listen for the ""singing"" balloon swords during the fierce duel.

Best song of the series: You Are a Pirate

Episode three:  The Mayor calls on Sportacus to encourage the children to play outside, and declares ""Sportacular Spectacle Day"" where Sportacus traditionally does an awesome stunt.  (My husband points out that this can't be right, because Stephanie isn't aware of the tradition, and she is the one who invites Sportacus to Lazytown in the very first Lazytown episode)  Anyway, Robbie pulls the old shoe switcheroo trick, and tries to make himself the new hero of Lazytown.

Good song: There is Always a Way

Episode four: Stephanie's scouting ideas get tossed aside by the new scoutmaster, who almost leads the others to disaster when an ill wind begins to blow. Stephanie and Sportacus come to their rescue and unmask the blowhard.

Cool song: Get Lazy

Recommended for any Lazytown fan, especially if you're into villains.
