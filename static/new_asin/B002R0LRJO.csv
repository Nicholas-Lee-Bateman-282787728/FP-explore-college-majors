3971163,5,B002R0LRJO,"One of my favorities animes, you won't be disappointed with this show, tons of laughs and excellent voice acting.
There is also a School Rumble manga which is nearly identical to the anime, but also continues further... past the show, so if we want to see season 3 we should definetly purchase the manga too.",1282262400,,308,4.618181818181818
3971164,5,B002R0LRJO,"I don't want to write a spoiler, but trying to describe with one word the Jin Kobayashi's works, I feel the most adequate is: funny-love.

School Rumble is not a classic romantic comedy. Maybe the audience can think the parodies and gags are the main stream, but the most awesome line of the story is that nobody can trap the goal of their lovely objective.  Neither Harima or Tenma can reach their platonic love but that's only the peak of the iceberg: behind them an emerging group of classmates who has a crush on them is able to everything in order to catch them.  Obviously misunderstandings and an unexpected final episode can disappoint most of the fandom, but as a famous anime blogger says, we (the fans) only can accept the encripted message the author wanted to develop.",1281916800,,781,4.644927536231884

3971166,5,B002R0LRJO,"School Rumble is a great watch for laughs. The absurd situations the characters are placed in and how they fail at expressing their undying affection is pure laughter formula. You will also finder yourself rooting for certain characters to succeed, other to fail, and some to get together already. At times it is also heartfelt; the tales of friendships and growing up is something we can all relate too (especially in season 2). Great stuff. You should buy it. ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE. $25 for season 1 and 2 plus OVA? unpassupable

WHY is it that I always buy a series before it has a box set cheap release... why? I spent 40 on season 1 and then 35 for each half season release of season 2... ridiculous. And I don't even have the pleasure of owning the OVAs.

Harima the hopeless idiot is in love with a girl in his class Tenma (who is also a hopeless idiot). Threw laugh out loud situtations they both try to confess their love. Unfortunatly for them their plans never end up like they'd expect.

3971170,4,B002R0LRJO,"School Rumble is a fascinating show.  One might judge by the cover that the show caters to females.  In fact, the show can be enjoyed by both sexes as it doesn't rely on heavy handed love stories to bog it down for men.  Instead, we have a show that focuses mostly on the misunderstandings of love--and the hilarity that comes with it.  This, men and women can appreciate.  The comedy here, too, borders on absurd which will make it easy to get into.  It's a show that you don't really have to think about, just enjoy.

However, there are a couple of reasons why it doesn't fully satisfy on the whole, and why some might be left wanting more after the last episode--specially when it comes to the main Harima-Tenma-Karasuma storyline.

Harima loves Tenma.  Tenma loves Karasuma. Karasuma loves curry--and he's oblivious of Tenma's love, just like Tenma is oblivious of Harima's love, just like Harima is oblivious of ...and so on and so on.  This is the basic premise for the show, a show that revolves around the entrapment that happens to people when they just can't get around to telling their true feelings to the object of their desire.  What then ensues is a hilarious outcome because of misunderstandings that happen between the characters, or within themselves, when they don't realize the true nature of someone else's actions.  Throw in some quirky characters and adventures and we have a show that will have you delighted from episode to episode.

The show's offbeat presentation also helps its aloofness, as some episodes are a compilation of small, separate stories, while others are full stories that take up the whole episode.  The great thing about this presentation is that it allows you to take this show in small doses and makes it more accessible to take in.  After all, there are about fifteen characters that dart in and out of the storyline so it's good to be able to separate some of these stories in chunks rather than take them all in at once in a single, linear story.  This might be off-putting for some, but I think it lends itself well here.

The biggest complaint that I could give the show is its ending.  In one way it does get resolved, but in another way, you feel like there should be a third season (and in a way there is).  The problem with this set is that it includes the first two seasons, and the two OVAs.  However, there is a ""third"" semester out there that is not included here, which gives the series a proper (if somewhat disappointing) ending.  It hasn't been licensed for American release, so in a way this isn't a true complete series.  The third season isn't a full season either.  It's an OVA that uses the last two episodes of the manga to finish off the story.

In any case, the story that is included in this box set won't give you a clear conclusion to the main Harima-Tenma-Karasuma story arc.  Still, you can't help but like what you DO get in the set, specially for the price.  In the end you'll want more, but in my case I felt satisfied with it.

While the problems above might disappoint some, the real reason to get this set is its comedy.  The show is funny.  Period.  You can't go wrong.  Pick it up and you'll have a blast, just as long as you know that you won't get the full picture in the end.",1270339200,37,3262,4.496598639455782
3971171,5,B002R0LRJO,"I've watched a lot of anime and this one has to be among the funniest I've seen.  There's at least one laugh out loud moment per episode.  A friend of mine let me watch the 1st season and I loved it, and couldn't wait to see the 2nd.  This is definitely well worth your time!  I never watch with dubs(well, I did with Cowboy Bebop as it was very well done) so I can't comment on the quality, but the voice acting in Japanese is as usual top notch. Definitely 2 thumbs up from me, :)",1260230400,8,482,3.9895833333333335
3971192,4,B002R0LRJO,"I really like this set. It was affordable and had everything. The only problem is that on the inside of the set there are lists of episodes. The second list is not readable, due to the case being glued to the back. When I tried to pull of the case, it messed up some of the writing. Still a great set, but expect some trouble reading the list for the second semester.",1328400000,,367,4.111111111111111
3971193,1,B002R0LRJO,"DO NOT BUY THIS SET, buy them separately first Semester, second Semester & Extra Class Ova, all three dvds together will be around $31 dollars so you save around $100 dollars",1324252800,3,174,4.645161290322581
3971194,5,B002R0LRJO,I love this show!!! its very funny but i really don't like the way it ends very much anyway i think that the Good Smile Company should make some figmas for this show or nendoroid set . But if your thinking of buying this set you should because it will cheer you up!!!,1321401600,,267,4.056603773584905
3971195,5,B002R0LRJO,"After watching the first episode the first thought I had was ""this is stupid. I can't believe everybody likes it"". But after watching the third episode, I was hooked.

There really isn't that much of a plot going on here, nor is this a complete shoujo (so both males and females can enjoy this series). I'll explain the plot as simple as I can: Harima loves Tenma who loves Karasuma who loves...?. There are a couple of other love octagons that wrap themselves around all the main characters. What's really humorous about this show is that all these characters who have crushes (mainly Harima and Tenma) are trying to confess their love, although it never works out the way they've planned it and always end up in total failure. Another funny thing that adds to this plot is that everybody involved in this story is completely oblivious to each other's feelings. Basically 70% of the story is about a maddening love octagon and 30% is complete randomness thrown in.

The only bad thing about it was the ending. It didn't wrap anything up and made it sound like there was going to be another mega third season, even though ""the mega third season"" is only two crappy episodes. Fortunately, if anybody wants to know how it decently ended, there is still the manga comics you can read.

I really liked the English dubbed version over the Japanese subbed. The voices were a bit rougher on the subs, particularly Harima's, which is a bit of a turn off on that part. Theme songs were pretty good, animation is good quality, and overall visual effects quite satisfying.

If your looking for an anime that has more of an intricate and deep plot, I probably wouldn't advise this. But even if you are looking for that or if you just want something funny to watch, you won't be able to help but laugh out loud A LOT. It's definitely one of my favorites and I recommend this one to anybody wanting a good laugh.",1315180800,,1898,4.557184750733138
3971196,4,B002R0LRJO,"Although I haven't watched the anime yet, it came on time and in great condition.  The $20 price was great for an entire series and I look forward to ordering more anime at these great prices.",1314662400,,192,4.333333333333333

3971198,5,B002R0LRJO,"This is a really an awesome collection. I knew about this anime for a long time, but I never bought any of the DVDs. Then I saw this last week and I snatched it as soon as I saw it. It was well worth the money.

It comes in a box set that is colorful and well decorated with the girls of the anime. Actually, it has an outer cover and the DVDs come in a book like case that slips out of the box cover. All ten DVDs are well kept is this one case that opens like a book. It's a perfect collection to show off. I would have bought it if it was in blu-ray too, but this is still good.

The actual anime is the same as you remember it; it's one hell of a ride! It's funny and it has a lot of comedy, romance, and drama. There are about 7 episodes per DVD. It includes 10 DVDs in total with all 52 episodes and the OVA.

Don't think twice and get this if you don't have the previous DVDs. You'll have the whole collection in one place and neatly kept.",1311897600,,946,3.816326530612245
3971199,5,B002R0LRJO,"I've never read the manga so I was a bit hesitant to watch the show but I have to admit, I enjoyed it. Every character seems to be oblivious of the others love for them and this makes a lot of the humor. The length might be a problem for some who don't have the time to watch a lot of episodes or who simply don't like spending a lot of time on just one anime. I love the humor though and that's why I suggest you buy it.",1309392000,,421,3.741573033707865
3971200,5,B002R0LRJO,"School Rumble is by far the funniest and most random anime I've seen. There is nearly no fan-service (up skirts/panty shots). There is a little fan service but by saying that...I mean that by the LITERAL DEFINITION of fan service (that includes anime girls in bathing suits).

There's a few little sexual jokes on certain episodes but they aren't as bad as most ecchi anime. This show wouldn't even come close to those type of shows. THIS SHOW IS PURE COMEDY AND NOTHING ELSE. It's also child-friendly. My nephew, who's 9yr old, loves this show and I don't blame him. This show is fun for all ages...at least that's my opinion. I ordered this with two day shipping on a Thursday around 2am. It said that it wouldn't be here until Tuesday of the following week. It came SATURDAY MORNING! Awesome!!",1308960000,,796,4.6453900709219855
3971201,5,B002R0LRJO,"This is one of the best animes I've ever seen. It's a beautiful tale of romance, school and friendship. The relationship between the characters is great and realistic which makes it even better then it already is. The story circles around two characters; Kenji Harima the rebel and Tenma Tsukamoto the ditsy sweet heart. Harima loves Tenma but Tenma loves the awkward Karasuma, thus begins the funny, heart warming love triangle.
The only problem I have with the anime is the ending, it leaves no closure and you have no clue what happen.
Overall I loved it and would recommend it to everyone, the manga is more well rounded and even more funnier. So please enjoy!",1304208000,,664,4.732758620689655
3971212,5,B002R0LRJO,"Usual chaotic love triangle story, which naturally branches out to more and more members until it resembles a dodecahedron more than a triangle.  And of course those with the least in common cause the most attraction, while the really good matches are ignored. This results in musical chairs situations as everyone keeps changing seats to ride together on a field trip, numerous macho contests to win the love while denying any love interest, disguises, trying to get alone (No. no! with her, not you!), attempts to aid that hurt, misunderstandings galore, and lots of fights ending with the lines 'Why are we fighting?' answered by 'I forget.' In short while love may not reign supreme, chaos, confusion, and humor do.",1302912000,,719,4.991666666666666
3971213,5,B002R0LRJO,"The first couple episodes were a bit slow for me, but the show quickly picks up. I won't bother describing the acutal show because Amazon already did a pretty good job of doing that. The story is very well written and every character is likeable. The only complain I have is the anime didn't acutally end.  If you want to see the real ending to the series you need to not only read the School Rumble Manga, but also the School Rumble Z manga. The School Rumble Z manga wraps up the story pretty well.",1302652800,,500,4.2631578947368425
3971214,5,B002R0LRJO,"Normally when a favorite series of mine comes to an end, it leaves me feeling disappointed in the way it ends. Not true with this series! Even though it's over,  you still feel a sense of hope for the main protagonist. It's a great show for all Anime fans. Some of the plots and story lines seem ridiculous and far fetched but that's what makes it so funny. In fact I laughed so hard sometimes I started crying and then choking because I couldn't catch my breath. Not many shows can do that to me. The price was fair, the DVDs were all intact. I reccomend this product  to anyone.",1301270400,,580,4.263636363636364
3971215,3,B002R0LRJO,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Comedy, Romance,

Situations: Probably PG+ (Innuendo)
Language: PG
Nudity: PG-
Violence: PG

  Language options: Dub, Sub with separate on/off option. The way it should be.
  The usual unforgivable offense: the ads that play on load can't be skipped or bypassed. (Like I need to see ads for stuff I own or will want to watch the same ads every time I watch this DVD for years to come...)
  DVD case is the type with the 2 discs overlapped. While nice for saving space, they are annoying to use, especially since the lower DVD has to be put into a notch on the retainer of the upper DVD.
  Irk 4: The production QA on these discs was so low I had to return 2 sets before I got a working one.

  Special Features: Disc 5: Clean open/close. Trailers(Previews) - Most are okay and at least moderately informative but I have 2 irks: 1) there are ads for itself. If I'm watching this series why spend the time and money to advertise it to me? 2) Not only a live-action ad, but one for the American TV series DeGrassi! If I wanted to watch that I'd DVR it. If I wanted ads for it I'd buy live-action sit-coms by the same company. Also Japanese TV commercials & TV spots, Cast interviews.
  Disc 6: Japanese voice actresses interview (Tenma and Yakumo's actresses), Textless songs, Season one OVAs (it looks like parts or ideas that were dropped that have been worked into episodes of their own. If so they are well done). Trailers - most the same as before.
  Disc 8: (season 2 disc 2) Interview (another) with Tenma's voice actress, Trailers - most the same as previous discs, Textless songs.
  Disc 10: Interview with the creator, textless songs, Trailers - some are new.

  This is a romantic comedy with main characters best described as ""not the brightest crayons in the box"". This lays the basis for the romance circle of everyone being in love with someone other than the person who's in love with them and being too dense to see what's happening. It starts with three and begins to spread through misunderstandings until it reaches most of the recurring characters. While this is amusing it would have made a much better 12 episode set as there are large parts of the series that seem to be little more than filling time and fishing for new material. I'd say, mostly because of this, I'd have to call this series pretty average. The voice acting is excellent though and saves what might have otherwise been a waste of time. It actually has some good points to make occasionally and isn't written badly. The addition of new characters happens at a pace that is easy to keep track of. It slips in parodies of animes and other popular Japanese TV show types. It even makes a struggle toward the end at having a moral.
  One (more) irk is that they change the opening around (scene before the opening, no scene before the opening, then back) in season 1 near the beginning.",1298246400,2,2937,4.538022813688213
3971216,5,B002R0LRJO,"I started watching School Rumble on a whim one day after my brothers had already been watching it for some time. After watching just one episode I decided I had to buy the series. I instantly loved it just like that. I've seen quite a few anime of all different types, tags, genres, etc. With that said School Rumble is a series that makes me literally laugh out loud every time. The characters are lovable, stupid, loud, crazy...basically like a big group of friends. It's a series about regular kids who are all caught in a big love triangle of their own, which eventually intersect to become something more like a love 12-gon. And even though there are parts of the series that seem expected and unsurprising, the show gives off a feeling of familiarity. You keep thinking ""How is he going to get out of this?"" or ""How could it possibly get any worse?"". No matter how bad it gets, the SR gang always manages to fix the problem at hand, or at least get themselves back to square 1. And somehow School Rumble keeps it interesting. There's something refreshing about it. A good series that makes you laugh and is easy to relate to at the same time. I definitely recommend this series.",1294790400,,1184,4.511627906976744
3971217,5,B002R0LRJO,"School rumble has got to be the funniest romantic comedy i have ever seen in my life. this box set includes first semester (all 26 eps) extra class OVA's (both eps) and second semester (26 eps), including some extras such as an interview with the Japanese voice actors for much of the main cast (about 14 interviews), an interview with the creator of school rumble, some original TV spots, the usual textless songs (which are great) and the Funimation trailers. If you looking to buy school rumble this is the box set to buy as it contains everything but the third semester OVA's (which are unavalible for purchas in the U.S. unfortunatly). The English dub of this series is also incredible and one of the best dubs ever produced in my opinion. i definitely prefer it to th japanese dub of the series. But as for the story this series follows the story of tenma tsukamato and the rest of the students in class 2-C. the story mainly follows Tenma, the queen of thick-headedness and Harima the clueless delinquent. See Harima likes Tenma, but Tenma likes Kurasma, the strange boy who likes curry. then later on in the series the show turns from a love triangle to a love octagon (or something with a lot of sides at least) as Hanai, Yakumo, Eri, Mikoto, Karen, Imadori, Naru, Sara, Aso and many more characters have their love interests conflict with others. About 60% of the comedy in this show is based these misunderstandings, the other 40% of the comedy is just pure randomness (for example Kurasuma's water imp costume), which is what makes this show great. All in all, this show is pure fun. It's one of those rare shows that will make you laugh until you cry at least a few times per episode and is great for anyone looking for a romantic comedy with a ton of comedy and a bit of seriousness as well.",1294099200,,1805,4.539877300613497

The storyline is your typical love triangle where every character has a love interest in the wrong person. This situation provokes the characters to interact strangely with one another & behave awkwardly. The plot is well developed with majority of the moments focused on the comedic expressions of the characters but does have some dull moments though.
The voice acting is excellent in portraying the characters personalities & emotions. The dialogue is straight forward & understandable with very little confusing grammar that might cause the viewer to scratch their heads.

You get a barrage of non-stop slapstick comedy throughout all of the episodes contained in this box set. Plus, the character(and their developments), storyline, animation, soundtrack, and character designs are all excellent. I think this anime is better than the other shows in the same sub-genre that are popular among other anime fans, like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh, in my honest opinion.

The heroine was with another guy. And this guy became a vegetable. Can you accept a comedy has a such bad ending? Thee is why this animation only have season one and season two.
