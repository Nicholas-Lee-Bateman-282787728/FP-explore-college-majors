I only wanted it because the kid was a friend of mine, Back in the day.",1400198400,,136,3.566666666666667
2564636,5,B000FGFUJK,"Don O'Kelly aka Don Kelly was scheduled to go on a public relations tour with ""The Hostage"" when it was released in 1966 but O'Kelly was stricken ill, subsequently died and ""The Hostage"" didn't get off the ground.  O'Kelly in ""The Hostage"" is a classic, believable performance. To learn more about Don O'Kelly aka Don Kelly enter Don O'Kelly, actor, deceased for personal history.",1265673600,2,380,4.9375
2564637,4,B000FGFUJK,"I love low-budget thrillers from the 1960's, and THE HOSTAGE is quite good.  It was theatrically released by Crown International Pictures, but I don't believe that it was a studio film.  I think it was an independent production that was filmed almost entirely in Des Moines, Iowa.  The color values probably weren't great even when the film was new.  However, the acting and script are always credible, and the villain is believably scary.  John Carradine and Harry Dean Stanton also appear in small roles.  If you like forgotten low-budget suspense pictures, this one really fills the bill.  The image is letterboxed.",1264636800,2,618,5.0594059405940595
2564638,2,B000FGFUJK,"Hmmmm...it's hard to say something really positive about this DVD. Despite some interesting Brazilian locales in ""Carnival of Crime"" (surprisingly, the trailer is a better transfer than the movie!) the film lacks a real sense of continuity--it really seems like two different films in one about a wealthy Brazilian building developer accused of killing his wife only to find out about her numerous affairs with his associates and business partners.  The print is so bad, replete with pops, surface dirt and jumps, it makes the movie painful to watch. A pity since it looks rather interesting.

As to 'The Hostage"" the only remarkable thing about it is the early appearance of Harry Dean Stanton as the meek half of a moving van crew who is an accomplice to a murder his partner has committed.  (They store the body in a chest of drawers inside the van until they can dispose of it.) Horror veteran John Carradine makes a cameo appearance as a vagrant and a link to the missing boy--hence the title of the movie.  While it can be argued that the film has some noir elements to it, it is lightyears away in quality or suspense from any traditional noir thrillers I have seen.

Despite the annoying title theme song whose refain is replayed ad nauseum throughout the movie, this film is poorly acted with very cheap production values that makes it look like an amateur production; nonetheless, the film is hardly suspenseful or interesting for that matter. This is surprising as Crown International Pictures who produced the film and, although responsible for many low-budget but interesting movies made in the 50's and 60's, ""The Hostage"" must be seen as one of their lesser efforts using virtually unknown actors.

The print of ""The Hostage"" is actually nicely restored, however.  Made in 1967, it must have been on the bottom half of a double-bill and deservedly so; thankfully, I purchased my DVD for only $3.99 at Rite-Aid!",1189641600,,1925,4.868501529051988
2564639,4,B000FGFUJK,"The Hostage was designed for suspense, and executed effectively.  A boy is accidentally locked in the back of a moving van driven by two killers.  A nosy neighbor saw him with a derelict in the park (John Carradine), leading everyone in the wrong direction while the boy witnesses the drivers burying their victim.  The situation, similar to The Window (1949), or Home Alone without the comedy, is very suspenseful due to good acting (especially by Harry Dean Stanton & the boy, played by Danny Martins), noir -ish cinematography, and effective direction, and despite a low production cost, the only effect of which is slightly faded color.",1171065600,4,640,5.018867924528302
2564640,2,B000FGFUJK,"I was glad I could rent this one from Netflix first because it definately saved me money. The first film, CARNIVAL OF CRIME, is a perfect match. By that I mean it's an awful movie with an equally awful transfer. The movie is supposed to be about an architect searching for his missing wife, only he ends up finding out about her many infidelities. The story was really dull and the audio and video was extremely low grade. In fact about 10 minutes into the film, it seems to switch to a completely different film (soundtrack and all) and then switches back again. The second movie, THE HOSTAGE, was not too bad. The audio and video was excellent and it's in widescreen. The story about a boy getting trapped inside a moving van driven by a psycho-killer moving man was OK. The little boy actually does a good acting job. It wouldn't be a big loss if you missed seeing either one of these films. If you are really curious about this DVD, do yourself and your wallet a favor and RENT IT FIRST!!",1155859200,7,992,4.396739130434782
8122199,1,B000FGFUJK,"This movie is terrible on every level - soundtrack (what is that?) editing (night? day? here? there?) plot - there isn't any - acting - not even up to neighborhood community theatre level - seriously.

So this crap is what Prime membership gets you?

Come on!",1486166400,,259,4.608695652173913

8122201,3,B000FGFUJK,"Carnival of Crime appears to have been filmed in 1:37:1 and accounts for the full frame presentation.  It is dubbed and is an uncut version.  I found it rather slow-moving with a worn print, but it is still watchable with no major issues.  I liked Hostage much better.  It's widescreen, moves along good, and has very good audio/video.",1454112000,,335,4.724137931034483
8122202,1,B000FGFUJK,This was so bad I didn't bother to watch more than 5 minutes.  Don't waste your time.,1434412800,,85,4.0
8122203,1,B000FGFUJK,"Technically the film is in the class of Edward D. Wood Jr. (Robot Monster).  Composition, editing, camera work, lighting are all dreadful.  Then there is a soundtrack that seems to have been dropped onto the movie with no thought for what is actually on screen.  The music is so bad that I wondered at first if it was a mixed up soundtrack.  Dialog recording is echoey throughout, but the music is there to hide this.

One of Ed's favorite tricks was to insert stock footage. Director George Cahan is paying homage and some of the jungle stock footage is laughable.

Performances are all amateur hour, but with no fun involved.  It's just plain bad.  I honestly don't think they did a second take for any scene.

After sitting through this dross, the worst thing of all is that I have very little idea what the film is all about, beyond the basic plot contrivances.  Several long sequences appear to be have been inserted from completely different movies and have no relationship to the narrative.

You may be thinking that this could be in the so bad it's fun class of genre movies that so many of us adore.  sadly, it's bad and boring and a waste of 90 minutes of our lives.  An endless loop of this movie would be cruel and unusual punishment.",1430006400,,1246,4.508928571428571
8122204,3,B000FGFUJK,"A poor print. Dubbing was fair-good. Awkwardly told, but basic plot had possibilities. The chase through the crowd at Carnival has been done better. Aumont has made better films.",1426032000,,178,5.172413793103448
8122205,1,B000FGFUJK,"I love old movies, but this was awful.  I would only watch this again if I were in a terrible mood, looking to pour myself a stiff drink and try to feel better about myself (relative to whoever wrote/acted in this).  It was that bad.  Someone at Amazon should watch this sober. (Sorry for being harsh, but hopefully I also made you laugh.  Don't say I didn't warn you.)",1419465600,,369,4.304347826086956
8122206,1,B000FGFUJK,"Architect, Mike Voray (Jean-Pierre Aumont) takes a business trip w/ his lovely young assistant, Marina (Tonia Carrero), leaving his wife, Lynn (Alix Talton) at home. When he returns, he finds her missing. Mystery ensues. In between these two points of intrigue, we are treated to a pair of macho-mustache-sporting mercenaries, endlessly bickering in the Brazillian rain forest. These two numb-skulls have no real place in this film. They're nothing more than a long, dull distraction. They're supposedly on the trail of a revolutionary, but come across like a pair of super-cops from some failed, 70s police show! They're way ahead of their time, since this movie came out in 1962!  Hmmm... Anyway, as if this ""bonus"" footage weren't brain-scalding enough, Mike's return home and subsequent search for Lynn, as well as most of the rest of the movie, is drowned in a ridiculous guitar soundtrack! At times it reminded me of the hideous, primal twang-ings in MESA OF LOST WOMEN, though it never quite scraped that far down. Mike's quest is simply not exciting, or involving at all. I didn't give a damn whether he ever found his wife or not! Petrified ""actors"" spouting ding-a-ling dialogue add to the overall misery. CARNIVAL OF CRIME is a languid ""thriller"" without thrills, suspense, or any good excuse for existing! Putrid on every level. You will pray for death's sweet embrace!...",1418688000,2,1384,5.0701754385964914
8122207,3,B000FGFUJK,"Was a fun, suspenseful movie and definately early 60's movie.",1418083200,,61,5.2
8122208,2,B000FGFUJK,"Carnival of Crime, indeed.  The quality of the picture is shoddy - very washed out.  The sound quality is also shoddy - I could barely make out anything said.  I removed this from my watchlist, disappointed.",1410825600,,207,4.694444444444445
