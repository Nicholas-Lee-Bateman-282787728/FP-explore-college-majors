8758264,5,B01EB2Z4TO,"This recording from 2015 features Andras Schiff in the dual role of conductor and pianist along with the specialist orchestra, Cappella Andrea Barca. That orchestra is a specialist group in so far as it is an ensemble made up of leading players largely drawn from freelance soloists and chamber groups. It was formed in 1999 with the intention of performing all the Mozart concertos with Andras Schiff, its director and solo pianist, at the Salzburg Mozart Week Festival until 2005. It has continued to meet since then sharing the mutual artistic concepts with Andras Schiff.

That special relationship is abundantly obvious in this very fine concert made up of three works by three composers originating from the Classical to early Romantic period of time. The concert is therefore a well-balanced programme.

Schiff is not a dramatic artist and his more gentle temperament comes over strongly on this disc, as indeed it does in all discs previously experienced. The period of music is also one which is closely associated with the pianist and his natural sympathies. During the course of this disc, unusually for this reviewer, a note was made of key words that would adequately describe the nature of these performances. They were, in no particular order, smile, magical, gentile, beneficence, lyrical, non-operatic, light, dancing, correct conceptual scale and a love affair.

The symphony is so far without competitors on BD or DVD and receives an attractive performance following the descriptors above. This is a symphony from the young Schubert where he discarded the clarinets and, more importantly, the trumpets and timpani. The emphasis on a string ensemble stands in direct contrast to the previous 4 symphonies or the following symphonies 8 and 9. (There was no Symphony 7, a gap created by publishing anomalies). This is a short, lyrical work which consciously avoids more dramatic gestures and this performance, with light, lyrical flow and dancing rhythms suits the music perfectly and also perfectly separates the marginally more dramatic concertos.

The Beethoven concerto has already attracted other notable pianists in the BD era. Both Buchbinder and Barenboim have produced complete surveys of the complete Beethoven Piano Concertos and there is also a version of by Argerich conducted by Barenboim. Both Barenboim and Argerich deliver far more dramatic accounts with sharp contrasts and plenty of bite. These could be described as exhilarating encounters while generally staying within the bounds of the Classical period. Barenboims account is the heavier weighted version despite his smaller ensemble whereas Argerich delivers a more mercurial account.  Buchbinder, by contrast, delivers a more considered account more obviously looking forward to the Romantic era and making tonal use of the much larger VPO to that effect. This is less dramatic, more lyrical and more flexible in terms of tempi and phrasing.

Schiff, on the other hand delivers a somewhat indulgent performance of the first movement which extends to 19 minutes. It is never less than convincing though primarily because of its obvious musical credentials. The slow movement is a thing of extended beauty and the final movement achieves more sparkle and sense of dancing light than most pianists. This brings the concerto to a joyous conclusion.

His account of the Mozart concerto stands in contrast to either of Barenboims current accounts on BD.  Whereas Barenboim takes a dramatic view in the sense of drawing thoughts of operatic comparisons, quite rightly when placing this large concerto within Mozarts operatic flowering, Schiff adopts a lyrically flowing approach to the whole work and which is surely not conceived in operatic terms in Schiffs mind. This is, once more, a thing of considerable beauty. This can be experienced almost anywhere but can be illustrated in the slow section within the final movement. This is a gracious, loving and intimate moment of quiet reflection whereas with Barenboim ones thoughts can turn to the countesss main aria in the Marriage of Figaro for example. Both versions are equally compelling.

The recording is exemplary to match Schiffs playing and that of his colleagues. The camera work is tastefully involving without being invasive and the sound, presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1 and stereo, is simply realistic in the best sense of the word.

This disc presents an occasion of beauty and joy and is a glorious testament to Schiffs innate gentle musicianship.",1477526400,2,4494,5.2639664804469275
