3611543,1,B001GJ4U96,The 3D version of this movie is terrible and it is not worth purchasing just for 3D.  It has double images.  The movie in 2D is better than the 3D version.  Don't waste your money if you are purchasing just for the 3D effect.,1231804800,,225,4.068181818181818
3611544,5,B001GJ4U96,"I had not heard or read too much about ""Fly Me to the Moon"". But the manager of the local DVD store highly recommended it. I bought a copy and thoroughly enjoyed it! I am a 57-year-old married man that's a DVD collector. I have easily over 1,500 DVDs in my collection. I will buy more copies of this movie to give to my nieces and nephews. It was cute, simple. The CGI was so colorful especially on our 55-inch Sony HD TV.
Give it a try and you won't regret it. Enjoy!",1231459200,9,468,4.043010752688172

3611546,4,B001GJ4U96,"After reading all the negative reviews of this little movie, I felt compelled to add my two cents worth in favor of Fly Me to the Moon-3D. I saw it about an hour ago in the theater with my almost 8 year old twin daughters. While it is not Speilberg or Lucas caliber, my daughters and I thought it was very cute and entertaining-the story was simple and easy to follow for kids. It has just enough action and suspense to keep you drawn in without causing kid-trauma. The 3D graphics were really fun-some of the best I've seen. And what kid doesn't enjoy a little gross fly-related feces humor? To put this in perspective, while looking for a movie tonight that would entertain, and not give my daughters nightmares, our only other choice was Journey to the Center of the Earth-3D. While I thought having giant angry killer fish fly at me in 3D seemed exciting, my daughters did not. That being fairly obvious, in some cases it is difficult for me to tell what will scare them until it is too late (and no, they don't lead a horribly sheltered life). This movie is nothing but gentle entertainment. For those who may be looking for something more cerebral, which this is not, it is at least fairly short. It was over before I was bored. As I watched, I kept wishing my grandsons were with us ( I know, do the math- I have 8 year olds, and grandchildren who are 4 and 5 years old. Go figure.) That's why I got on line to see if the Fly movie was available for purchase yet. I can't wait for them to see it! So not to put a fly in the ointment of all the harsh critics who want to squash this movie, but I'd give it a big thumbs up. 4 fly swatters out of five( i took one away because Shakespeare it's not). Its good, mindless entertainment, which is just what we want sometimes, right?",1219276800,2,1782,4.259587020648968
3611547,3,B001GJ4U96,"You find yourself using the word ""cute"" to describe a lot of ""Fly Me to the Moon."" The basic story of three young flies hitching a ride on the moon is cute. Most of the characters are pretty cute, each with big, soulful eyes and tiny hands and round heads. The general innocence of the film itself is pretty cute, as is the fact that it's presented in 3-D. The thing is, cute can only get you so far. This is the third animated film of the summer to involve non-human characters in space (the first two being ""WALL-E"" and ""Space Chimps""), and of those three, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is definitely the least challenging and the least entertaining. It has its moments of fun, and I have no doubt young kids will get a kick out of it. But for most people, it's really no better or worse than an extended episode of an early morning kids show. Some may even be bothered by its Cold War mentality, where Americans are fearless and heroic while Russians are vile and sinister.

The story proper takes place in 1969, just as Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins were about to make history on Apollo 11's mission to the moon. In a swampy junkyard just outside of Cape Canaveral, three school-age flies decide to stow away on the mission and become the first flies in outer space. The leader, Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), is the headstrong, adventurous one. The brains of the group is naturally named I.Q. (voiced by Philip Bolden), and you know he's smart because he's the only one wearing glasses. Scooter (voiced by David Gore) is the fat, timid one, and nothing other than food is on his mind. Already, you might have noticed that all three sound like virtual clones of our favorite chipmunks, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore; it may not matter a great deal, but I have a feeling many of the adults in the audience will get the feeling they've seen these characters before.

After a discussion with his equally adventurous grandfather (voiced by Christopher Lloyd), Nat, I.Q., and Scooter sneak into Cape Canaveral on the morning of the launch. Once inside the rocket, they hide themselves inside each astronaut's helmet. The constant media coverage allows everyone in Nat's world to see him and his friends go into orbit, including Nat's mother (voiced by Kelly Ripa), a worrisome woman who constantly faints. She doesn't see eye to eye with her father, always filling his grandson's head with fantastical stories of real life adventures. One of Grandpa's most popular stories is of how he was with Amelia Earhart during her solo transatlantic flight; he actually had to fly up her nose to keep her from falling asleep. We actually see this happening as a flashback sequence, and it culminates with a lovely shot of Earhart sneezing Nat's grandfather out her nose.

Our three friends, meanwhile, are having their own adventure on their way to the moon. Little do they realize that, back on Earth, a small group of Russian flies are devising a plan to steal credit for the space mission away from the Americans. The team leader, named Poopchev (voiced by Ed Begley, Jr.), sends a spy named Yegor (voiced by Tim Curry) to infiltrate Cape Canaveral's control center and alter Apollo 11's landing coordinates. Will the Russians succeed, or will America's indomitable spirit conquer all that threatens democracy? If you actually have to think that one over, (a) you don't know how the Apollo 11 mission ended, and (b) you don't see very many kid's movies. Not that it matters a great deal; the very idea of a kid's movie reverting to Cold War prejudices is not at all appealing. The Russian characters in ""Fly Me to the Moon"" are ugly, vile, and stupid, perfect fodder for animated villains. Shouldn't we have gone beyond this by now?

The only Russian character made to look pretty is Nadia (voiced by Nicollette Sheridan), who Nat's grandfather met in France after Amelia Earhart's flight. After years of being apart, Nadia defects from her country to help Grandpa save the Apollo mission, which in turn would save his grandson. Why the filmmakers felt the need to include this character or even this subplot, I have no idea. What rule states that all animated films need heroes and villains? Why do they all need that kind of conflict? It seemed that Nat, I.Q., and Scooter's mission in space was already full of conflict, especially when the astronauts realized they had flies on board.

At a certain point in the movie, the real Buzz Aldrin appears to make what can only be described as a public service announcement. Yes, it was cute that he decided to play along. But really, was that necessary? Don't we already know that the men and women of NASA are brave people that have opened doors? And what does any of that have to do with flies? The animation and 3-D effects of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" were decent enough. I distinctly remember two scenes: one featured Nat, I.Q., and Scooter doing a zero-gravity synchronized dance to the tune of ""The Blue Danube""; the other was a recreation of Neil Armstrong's first step on the lunar surface. Both were wonderful to look at--the latter was oddly beautiful, in a childish sort of way. But for everything the film achieved visually, the story needed a lot of work. It needed to be less cutesy and more entertaining. It needed fewer clich&eacute;d characters. It needed to be less preachy with its patriotism. You leave this movie knowing that if the filmmakers had tried a little harder, they would have had something that could appeal to everyone, not just to kids.",1219017600,,5512,4.701863354037267

3611620,4,B001GJ4U96,"I will be honest & say that I am extremely picky when it comes to movies my kids watch. Kids are literally like sponges, & even if you don't see an immediate effect, what they watch & ""ingest"" are seeds that will grow into something positive or negative in the future. We watched the normal version, not 3D, so I can't comment on the 3D effects. Overall, I didn't feel like it quite deserved 5 stars, because it wasn't an ""over-the-top"" amazing movie & storyline. It was a really cute story though. There aren't any bad words or vulgar language. There aren't any scenes that would be too intense for young children. It's includes a good adventure with some adversaries, & there are sweet moments as well. It has an overall good message about courage & pursuing your dreams. For those who complained that it ""didn't hold the kids' attention,"" my gut guess, is these children have already become used to more adult forms of adventure. I am not putting those parents or children down. But if your children have only been exposed to strictly children's movies, then this one is a good one for them that you won't have to worry about anything bad surprising you in.",1454630400,2,1160,4.581730769230769

As a caregiver to an elderly parent, I'm unable to get out to run errands and the post office where I live is only open certain hours.  To be able to get there during those hours, I would have had to take off work and hire a sitter just to go see where the package had actually been delivered, so I blew it off.  +/- $8 down the drain. It would have cost me considerably more to do this than the movie was worth!!  As they had no desire to assist me in finding their merchandise, I won't be purchasing from Movie Mars ever again...even if I have to pay more...it's not worth the lack of caring or assistance.  They really need to look at their customer service model...it really ""bites"" as it is now.",1374451200,,1272,4.270833333333333

3611725,3,B001GJ4U96,"A few years ago space themed computer generated movies were all the rage.  Space Chimps (and Space Chimps 2), Wall-E, Mars Needs Moms, Planet 51, Fly Me to the Moon; rockets, space travel, you really couldn't go wrong.

Fly Me to the Moon had all of the makings of a blockbuster hit: A pretty decent budget of $25-mil, a solid vocal cast, a US & Canadian theatrical release including IMAX, and believe it or not, so scientifically solid was the piece that it arrived to theme parks the world over as an attraction (the film was shown minus a subplot involving Russian flies trying to sabotage the US space mission) and as the inspiration behind a 13-minute ride at several Six Flags locations!

Sadly what all of this does not reveal is that the film itself feels fairly flat and uninspired despite some real attempts at Pixar-level creativity scattered about.  But we'll get to all that, let's take a look at the facts first.

Fly Me to the Moon was released theatrically in January of 2008 and came to DVD the following December as both a 2D and 3D release (but not modern 3D mind you, think blue and red lensed paper framed glasses style- of which 2 pairs are included in the 3D DVD release).  It comes in at a runtime of 85-minutes and wears a G (general audience) rating.  Having raked in over $41-million, it is considered a commercial success despite being considered a critical failure.  It also boasts the distinction of being the first animated feature film designed for 3D (DreamWorks would later run with this concept through a series of shorts involving its marquee characters from the Shrek and Monsters Vs. Aliens franchises).

Written by Domonic Paris and directed by Ben Stassen, the film involves a threesome of Floridian houseflies stowing away on the iconic Apollo 11 moon mission.  To be honest when the film opens, the viewer almost gets the feeling they're in for a slightly more sophisticated incarnation of Space Chimps with characters copied and pasted from A Bug's Life but as the film wears on, it becomes clear that what I just described would be far more enjoyable than what's actually there.  The three main characters are typical kid archetypes from just about any children's movie: Nat (Trevor Gagnon), who admires his grandpa's (Christopher Lloyd) war stories, the brainy one IQ (Philip Bolden) and the fat, lazy one Scooter (David Gore).  The trio constructs a small rocket out of junk they collected but Nat convinces the gang that the only way to get to the moon would be to hitch a ride on the Apollo 11, which just so happens to be about to launch from nearby Cape Canaveral.

As much as I'd like to tell you that my summary there omits all of the character and charm that makes computer generated features so enduring, the fact of the matter is that's really it- just like that.  The rest of the film consists only of unnecessary dialog segments, a weak subplot whereby some jealous Russian flies get word of the US being the first to put man (and flies) on the moon and do their best to sabotage things and a fight sequence that fails to create any sense of tension.  In fact the film's greatest weakness (aside from a complete lack of comic relief) could be its absence of conflict from which to advance the plot.  Rather than create a situation that holds the viewer's attention because they absolutely must know how things will resolve, what you get here is essentially a succession of set-ups that pay-off with iconic images of the first man to walk on the moon.  It's a lot like watching archival footage of the actual mission with a few cute little bugs drawn in the corner of the frames.  Sure it's important stuff for its historical impact but not exactly riveting entertainment.

Additionally the flies themselves become a bit of a tough sell because unlike other (much better developed) bug flicks like A Bug's Life, Antz or The Bee Movie, you have some cartoony critters (the flies) mixed with near photo-realistic and scientifically accurate renderings of other insects (like a spider for example).  Plus it's never made clear if the humans in the film are able to hear/ understand the pint sized adventurers as there is a scene that makes reference to the fact that they may be able to but it never provides evidence conclusively.  It sounds silly, sure but let's be honest here: Had Neil Armstrong discovered an English-speaking housefly in a tiny spacesuit on his shoulder at Mission Control, it's possible the whole moon mission would have taken the back seat to this discovery!  In case you think I'm picking nits here, do keep in mind that Buzz Aldrin himself makes an appearance at the film's conclusion to remind viewers that no flies were actually present during the Apollo 11 mission.  So much for suspension of disbelief.

All in all, the film doesn't commit major crimes so much as it simply doesn't do anything to make it worth recommending.  Its main appeal surely lies in the fact that's nearly scientifically accurate to teach the younger kids about the actual Apollo 11 mission and space travel in general.  Of course the down side is that what has been created by the movie for entertainment's sake is either abrasive (Russia can't be too happy with their representation here) or inaccurate to the point that a real astronaut has to come on and tell us that it didn't happen... In other words, use it as a teaching tool at your own discretion.

Finally there's the 3D gimmick to consider.  Yes the illusion that junk is popping off the screen is preserved fairly well here but that is assuming you are one of the individuals willing and able to wear the included 3D glasses for the duration of the film because to everyone else in the room, the colors and textures are going to look terrible.  Of course the DVD menu does offer the option of running it in the much more watchable 2D presentation hence making the 3D gimmick rather useless as a whole.

3611732,4,B001GJ4U96,"The good:
* Background is real events - gives viewers an idea of history
* Very clean (worst language is ""Oh my Lord of the Flies"" and violence is really there in only two scenes)
* Very simple plot - good for young children (we watched this with a 3-year old and he understood it)
* Lovely and imaginative renderings of the flies' parallel world in the junkyard
* Buzz Aldrin makes an appearance at the end. (This was my favorite part of the movie.)

The bad:
* Sloppy production with obvious bloopers (""Authorized Personal Only"" in big letters in the middle of the screen, Amelia Earhart lands in France, not Ireland)
* Very simple plot - boring for adults
* Very simple characters - calling them 2 dimensional is giving them too much credit. Every character (except maybe the astronauts) is a caricature.
* Scooter, one of the main characters, has a problem with compulsive eating. This problem comes up a lot and gets a lot of screen time. They try to play it for laughs and to make it one of the central conflicts in the movie. But the jokes are not funny and Scooter isn't struggling with the problem - it is just other people telling him he needs to eat less and focus on other things. So it is neither a good for laughs nor as a conflict.

I personally didn't enjoy the movie very much. Then, why, you ask, did I give it 4 stars? My son liked it and he is the intended audience. Additionally, there was no magic. A kid's movie with no magic and no ""I think I can, I think I can"" gets an automatic upgrade with me - realism requires extra work and imagination on the part of the writer. Finally the movie gives a view of an incredibly important historic event (when our species first set foot on another world) and treats it as important. I hope my son wants to grow up to be an astronaut and views the much coveted position of ""rock star"" as meaningless trash unworthy of his talents.

I watched it on my 55 inch Sony, and the flies seemed to really come off the screen and hover midway between the TV and where I was sitting.

3611742,3,B001GJ4U96,"`Fly Me to the Moon' is a pretty average animation about three flies who stow away on the Apollo 11 mission and make their way to the moon. There are lots of `in-jokes' if you are aware of the original mission and Buzz Aldrin even appears at the end to say a brief message. The animation is pretty basic, with under par character animation, although saying that some of the weightless scenes were better than expected. The story is simple and nothing too great, but for an 80 minute animation to keep the kids entertained this should do the job well enough. There's not too much for an adult audience though. Compared to some other animations out there (I.e. nearly everything from Pixar!) this lacks a certain something, but in it's own right it is a perfectly watchable film.

I abhor any movie that blows its own patriarcal trumpet - and this is no exception. I laughed out loud at some of the lines - and not because it was funny but quite simply unbelievable!

The characters are dull and flat, the story predictable and lifeless. The lecturing and the self congratulation USA - patting itself on the back was quite vomit inducing. Even the opening line to the move (which should have acted as a warning - not an opener) had a ring of superioty about it.
Not only did the film have strong biast tones - it was also dreary and predictable. I was embarrassed to be watching it (even though noone else - other than by children were around).When an astronaught goes to spray the flies (said characters)  and stopped because 'They are American too"" I nearly lost the plot. I don't know any other movie that hero worships itself in quite the same way as this one.

3611751,1,B001GJ4U96,"We got this movie for our little girl and hoped it would be good for adults.  It was neither.

First off the animations would have been amazing had they come out 20 years ago.  By today's standards they were terrible.  The movement was clunky, stiff, and not fluid at all.  The facial animations while a little better were not better by much.

Along with the animations, the lack of detail for the characters was just as bad and made the poor animations look that much worse.  Unlike any other good cartoons like Pixar movies and Shrek, never once did I feel in awe of the picture.

To add insult to injury, the movie abused the 3D effects as much as they possibly could.  It was as if each screen was intended not to tell the story or advance the plot but rather to freak out the audience using the 3D features.  Not only is this lame but it absolutely ruins the movie when NOT watching it in 3D.  It was almost like being on a cheap ride at a theme park at points.

Story was as bad as the rest.  It was not interesting, believable, or entertaining.  Now kids movies do not have to be believable but at the very least should have some shred of truth to it.  Not this movie.  Nor did the challenges really make sense or engage me as a viewer.  I guess this movie was geared towards small children but then again my daughter hated it too.

Characters were bad too.  None had any real depth and never gave you much of a reason to care about any of them.

Overall I wish I could have given it less stars.  It was almost as if they said hey lets just make a movie about being 3D and then fill in the other details later.  I would only recommend this movie to somebody that is in need for punishment.",1248912000,2,1696,4.185758513931889

 The fly's design is a cross between the Smurfs and some discarded character designs from 'A Bug's Life'. The voice work is nothing special either. The story is interesting and overall is a fairly enjoyable film experience, but it just isn't up to the likes of Pixar's efforts.

What is most disappointing is the 3-D version on the DVD. The color is almost non-existent and what color is there is completely off. The Maggot babies are lime green where as in the 2 D version they're pink-ish. If fact most anything with color is lime green and the rest looks like a black and white film or the color is so subtle you have to strain to see what color it is...... it's too distracting and it looks awful!

Also, there is the typical double vision effect which wouldn't be so bad if the color was right. I also feel that two cheap sets of 3-D glasses are not enough to include with the DVD. I mean really?... how much could these things cost? If you want to watch the 3-D version with you kids, you'll have to take turns!?? They should have included at least four pair of glasses and why not six?

If only they had spent as much time making the story shine as they did the technical details of the moon landing, Fly Me would be a little gem of a movie.  But sadly, the writing is unimaginative, the story clunks unnaturally along, and the characters are uninspired and stereotypical (offensively in some cases, as with the panicky mother who keeps fainting at the slightest hint of trouble; then you have the lead trio itself, composed of the ""leader,"" the ""smart kid with glasses,"" and the ""fat kid""--Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, anyone?).

And what's with Buzz Aldrin's rant at the end reminding kids that it's all just pretend?  Do kids need to be talked down by having it explained to them that flies don't really talk and weren't actually on the moon mission?

Excusing this movie's lack of quality because it's ""just for kids"" is lazy.  Kids shouldn't have to suffer through boring movies that insult their intelligence any more than adults.

I'm pretty sure the ole' Mom lecture on the space race wouldn't have had nearly the impact. There's even a cameo appearance by Buzz Aldrin at the end.

After 1 watching my daughter was hooked. We actually rented it from Netflix and have had it a month as she won't let us return it. Every morning, every night, all day on weekends ""Can I watch fly me to the moon pleeaaseee?!"" So now I'm on Amazon buying it because I have to think eventually Netflix will want their movie back.

I'd recommend this for any family with small children, particularly those who find a lot of other movies too scary.",1231891200,,1185,4.472222222222222
