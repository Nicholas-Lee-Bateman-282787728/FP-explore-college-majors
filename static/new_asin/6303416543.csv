644160,5,6303416543,"Plays on tape usually don't tickle my fancy.  I'm not even a  ""Masterpiece Theatre"" type of guy, however this production of  Nicholas Nickleby is incredibly absorbing and entertaining.  It runs the  whole gamut of human emotions.  Hollywood may have made Dickens nauseating  to an extent, but the RSC  really brought the novel to life, in a  brilliantly fast moving, well acted and staged production.  - - I remember  watching it when it originally aired on PBS, and I was only 11 I stuck  through all 9 episodes.  Now rewatching it almost 18 years later,  everything has come back like it was yesterday.  - - Dickens was a master  architect at creating memorable charactors, and forever, it will be the  faces and images of this production that I'll think of if I ever reread the  novel !  - Don't be surprized if you sit through the whole thing in only a  few nights.  Its a Dickensonian soap opera, and the ending of each tape  will get you running to get the next volume in the VCR.",962582400,7,986,4.514285714285714

This story has everything: rags to riches, romance, redemption, humor, great  villains -- three hankies, at least -- and a mini performance of Romeo and  Juliet, revamped for Victorian sensibilities.  Beautifully done, deeply  memorable, and a lot of fun because of the staging and all of the folks  playing multiple parts.  In spite of the nine hour length I managed to see  this show twice in 1982 when it first aired.",955324800,,561,4.585858585858586

644272,5,6303416543,"This is the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Nicholas Nickleby, featured on PBS in the 80s. I loved this interpretation of the Dickens novel. The company (few actors in many roles) acts out Mr. Armstrong's adaptation of the play to a live audience over the course of nine episodes.

I was unable to find this anywhere, until I purchased it through Amazon. It is an amazing performance which combines the bleakness of the Dickensian novel with an amusing wit and LOTS of asides--sort of like if Dickens had worked with Shakespeare, THIS is what they would come up with.

There are 9 episodes, each lasting an hour a piece--commercial-free and well worth the investment of time and money. A great addition to your DVD library. I can't say enough great things about this production.",1395446400,2,788,4.873134328358209

Roger Rees in the title role is brilliantly supported by many luminaries of British stage and screen: David Threlfall, John Woodvine, Alun Armstrong, Ian McNeice, Bob Peck, and Edward Petherbridge to name but a few. Dickens offset his condemnation of the plight of the poor with a tender love story and scenes of joyful exuberance.

As a student of theatre, I have always been amazed at the complexity and overall excellence of the performances.  It was recorded and available on VHS tapes when aired on A&E, and these DVDs appear to be an exact copy of the VHS recordings.  It would have been nice if they'd made the DVD version more seamless, more like the original stage production instead of broken up over 9 segments as it was aired, but that's a small quibble.

The only other stage performance that I've witnessed that comes even close to ""Nickleby"" was a staging of ""Tristan and Isolde"" in Vienna at the Royal Opera.  I've watched my  VCR copy several times and  am ALWAYS moved and ALWAYS staggered by its emotional power and beauty.

Don't be put off by the fact that it's a play, with people moving sets around, curtain calls, especially if you were like me and expecting some polished movie version of Nicholas Nickleby. Imagine my surprise when the actors entered the stage, from their places out in a real theater with a live audience. Then the actors began speaking, one by one, giving little one-liner blips about the story. Boy was I getting worried that I had wasted my money, but that feeling didn't last long before I was deeply drawn into the story. These people are real professionals. They presented the story so that I will never forget it. I can't say that about most of the movie versions of novels, even those I enjoyed. I'll never forget this one!

Here's what amazed me and pleased me the most. We, the viewers, watch as the sets are quickly changed and the actors go from being 'narrators' to the characters in the novel. It happens in an INSTANT! Amazing!  How do they make that transition instantly?! Well, it's because they are talented actors and this is why people appreciate them. I wasn't familiar with any of them until now because I don't follow such things, but I now number with those who appreciate them for their acting skills.

The audience occasionally gets to participate during scenes which include the public streets, markets, etc. You can see how they are enjoying themselves, and that's fun, but surprisingly doesn't detract from the story. It just makes it more enjoyable.

You see a narrator and recognize him as an actor with stage makeup.
You see the same person a moment later in his role and he IS the character he is playing.

Not what I had expected, and if I had thought this was what I was getting, I wouldn't have ordered it. However, I'm so glad I did order it.",1269648000,,1816,4.575384615384616
644399,3,6303416543,"First, I have not viewed this DVD from A&E.  I saw the original PBS broadcast years ago and would like to purchase a digital copy.  I gave this entry a 3-star to be neutral.  My memory of the broadcast would be 5-star.

Now for the reason for this entry.  It appears that there is great dissatisfaction with the A&E transfer.  The detractor's comments are very convincing and give me reason to consider another source of the transfer.  There is a region 2 (PAL) DVD set available from Amazon UK.  The reviews on the UK site make no mention of transfer quality issues.  The published list price is 30 or ~43USD.  It costs less for the UK version.

All you need is a DVD player that is region free and can play PAL discs.  There is such a legitimate beast available from many sources including Amazon.  The unit is the OPPO DV-981HD.  Check it out.  It gets great reviews.  I really like mine.  It is a terrific upconverting unit that will play both NTSC and PAL formats.  It comes as a region 1 player, but can be easily converted in less than a minute to all regions by entering in a cheat code that is published on many web sites.  A simple Google search will provide the needed code.  OPPO can't provide the code directly due to licensing restrictions.

I have gone to Amazon UK to purchase DVDs that are not available here in NTSC format.  I have made many purchases of PAL format programs to watch on my entertainment system.  My most significant purchase of a PAL format set was the entire Poldark series that was shown on Masterpiece Theatre years ago.

I realize that I am recommending the purchase of another device, but it is a solution that opens many doors for the legal acquisition of programs not available in the US market.  I will be purchasing a PAL version of Nicholas Nickleby in the next few days.  It will arrive in less than a week with standard shipping.

Update January 9:  I just purchased a PAL copy from Amazon UK for 9.55 or $14.46.",1230768000,6,1959,4.426966292134831
644400,5,6303416543,"This was unquestionably one of the most wonderful theatrical productions of all time, and to experience it in any form is vastly preferable to never encountering it at all.

That said, this presentation of the production is not as good as it might be. A bit of history:

1. The theatrical play was produced in two parts, viewed either on consecutive nights or all within a single day. Part One was divided into two acts, Part Two into three, totaling around 8 hours of performance (not counting intermissions or meal breaks).

2. The play was adapted and taped for broadcast. It aired in four installments, the first three lasting 2 hours each (with one intermission), the fourth lasting 3 hours (with two intermissions). This required the playwright/adapter David Edgar to redivide his five-act play into four acts, and to further break each act into 53-minute segments, resulting in a nine-part video adaptation.

3. The video adaptation was released by CBS Home Video on four VHS tapes, one intermissionless act per tape, but with significant changes from the broadcast. On the plus side, about 80 seconds were added to a scene in Act 2. On the minus, 25 minutes were removed from the beginning of Act 4 and inserted at the end of Act 3, necessitating a cut of about 15 seconds from the Act 4 recap. A scene lasting about two and a half minutes was cut. (It's the scene in Act IV where the loony Gentleman Next Door visits the Nicklebys.) Audience reaction sounds were clumsily and distractingly added at moments, including the very final moment of the show. And worst of all, over 20 musical cues are completely missing.

4. Much later, A&E rereleased the production on nine VHS tapes. The content of the production is identical to the CBS Home Video version in every way, nothing added, nothing removed. The nine segments break at precisely the same points that the broadcast did, with A&E merely adding opening and closing credits to each segment.

5. A&E later released their version on DVD, with the same nine segments scattered over four DVDs.

And that is how we arrived at the current state of affairs. It's far from perfect, but A&E is not responsible for any of the damaging flaws that were introduced in the original home video release.

644401,2,6303416543,"The novel celebrates the triumph of sweet lively spirits in dark times and places, while this DVD is a tribute to the power of a dismal tone to kill delightful dialogue, hilarious situations and charming characters. Look at  that grim haunted face on the DVD case -- it isn't Ralph Nickleby, as I assumed when I bought the set, but this performance's version of sunny, irrepressible, boyishly earnest Nicholas. I like the script and production but the tone starting with Nicholas is just so pervasively wrong that I couldn't see it through.",1222905600,,540,4.869565217391305
644402,1,6303416543,"It is incomprehensible why this DVD version of this glorious play is being sold at all. One scene has been entirely omitted from the original telecast and the entire DVD set is as badly recorded as it was edited. Save your money for the set sold through the National Theatre. Currently, it is available only as a Region 2 recording, but with a bit of lobbying, I'm sure a Region 1 or All Regions version will be made available.",1213920000,8,427,4.417721518987341
644403,3,6303416543,"I took a chance on this set in spite of the many reviews which did not like the production values of the product from a technical point of view.  I expected the worst but was willing to put up with it to recapture my fond memory of having seen the production on TV.  What I found was quite a surprise.  The picture on my 32 inch LCD is brilliant and clear.  I see no distortion and have no trouble with the sound quality.  The acting company is attractive with many superlative actors taking different parts in the large cast of characters.  My choice of only three stars is based on several considerations.

There are no subtitles which are often needed when the uneducated characters are speaking in unintelligible dialects.  Since actors often play several parts the are often called upon to play minor roles of personages whose sex they do not inhabit.  This would be fine in a stage production but a bit unsettling in the closeups.  Too often the ruffian boys will turn up as maids in a following scene and vice versa.  It is distracting and only adds to the confusion of an already confusing story line.

I will return to the BBC production with Nigel Havers as my video of choice for this story even though that series has more than it's share of uninspired bits.",1213142400,4,1270,4.497816593886463

644405,5,6303416543,"Nicholas Nickleby is not only my favorite Charles Dickens' book--indeed, my favorite book period--but this production is the ONLY adaptation of which I wholeheartedly approve.  It is eminently true to the text and only a handful of adaptations (of any work) are.  I've lost track of how many times I've watched this production.  I used to check it out of the library at every available opportunity and finally, I decided to buy my own copy.  I watched it twice within the first week I owned it and have happily loaned it out to two of my students, who appreciate such experiences.

If you're a fan of stage productions in general and enjoy analyzing directing styles, this will appeal to you on that level as well.  Even the narration is breathtaking.  The cast is unparalleled--characterizaztions are spot-on as Dickens would have intended.  His wonderful characters ""live"" in this production as in no other I've seen.  You'll love them, hate them, cheer for them and weep for them and feel as if you've lived among them for these hours.

This is a must-see for anyone who loves Dickens, England, literature, or the stage in general.",1180656000,4,1134,4.829015544041451
644406,5,6303416543,"Neither the 2000 television version nor the 2002 film could ever hope to match the magic, passion, dramatic heights and emotional involvement of this nine hour Royal Shakespeare Company production. All the characters and subplots of Dickens' novel are presented in a whirlwind of drama, comedy, tragedy and romance. It was a wise decision, when putting the production on film, to retain as much of its theatrical flavor as possible. Because it is that theatricality that produces as much of an impact and lasting impression as the characters and plot.

Originally staged by the RSC in the early 80's at the Aldwych Theatre, this version was taped at the Old Vic before the company took the show to New York. At times, an audience is visible (and audible) especially when various characters leave the stage to wander or race through the aisles or along the front of the balcony. It must have been a wonderful experience. But the DVD compensates us for not actually being there by providing that which you cannot get in a theatre - close-ups of the actors. Only once is this overdone - when Ralph Nickleby is finally denounced, the camera lingers much too long on an extreme close-up as the other characters are only heard revealing the sins of his past. But other times, such as during the silences between lines or the looks between characters, the close-ups are quite wonderful.

A cast of 30-some actors portray about 150 characters between them. Of course, doubling or even tripling is an ancient theatrical convention. But never have I seen it used as effectively as here. Only Roger Rees, as Nicholas, plays a single part. This is real acting we are witnessing.

The nine hours are divided into four acts spread over three discs. Each act is divided into two or three parts, each with the same opening and closing credits. This makes it possible to watch in installments although one at a time never seems enough. My wife insisted that we watch the entire 167 minute final disc in one sitting. The time flies by.

The story is typical Dickens, full of noble poor people and disreputable rich ones, with complex plotlines that would be the envy of any modern soap, complete with Dickens' famous penchant for incredible coincidences. But this is more than mere melodrama and everything about the production combines to make it all fresh and exciting and involving. These are characters you genuinely care about (or, in a few instances, love to hate). And there will not be a dry eye in the house during Smike's final scene.

As I said, all the actors are brillian but most memorable are Roger Rees (who seemed born to play the part), David Threlfall as Smike (an astonishing performance), John Woodvine as the evil Ralph Nickleby (cool underplaying with bursts of temper), Alun Armstrong as Squeers, the villain from hell, Edward Petherbridge as Newman Noggs, Suzanne Bertish in several roles, a pre-Edge Of Darkness Bob Peck as two wildly different characters, and Emily Richard in the thankless role of goody-goody Kate Nickleby.

One word to anyone who has never seen this production. Act One is decidedly grim and occasionally brutal. When this was first shown on television, I knew several people who never got beyond that part. But don't give up. Once Nicholas rebels against Squeers and leaves the school, everything lightens up considerably. And no one should miss the marvellous finale to Act Two when Nicholas and Smike and a travelling theatre company perform the final scene from Romeo And Juliet, complete with exaggerated Victorian acting and a happy ending (""I wasn't dead - I was stunned"")!

I'm absolutely delighted that Nicholas NIckleby has become available on DVD. I recommend it to anyone who loves theatre, great acting or just a rollicking good old-fashioned story.",1093478400,31,3791,4.9140625
644407,5,6303416543,"I saw 'Nicholas Nickleby' about 20 years ago and have never been able to forget it. It is the best theatre I've ever seen or will ever see again. The sheer facts are astounding: nine hours long, 39 actors playing 150 parts. Only Roger Rees has one part as Nicholas Nickleby, and it's easy to see he could have hardly taken more, being so much on stage. He is a bit old for Nicholas, but creates a very convincing, somewhat naive but - when needed - passionate young man. And his part is heavy for the mere fact that he has to carry Smike and fall down on the floor with Fanny Squeers around his neck - twice, because they do it again on one of the 'what has happened so far' -scenes in the beginning of acts. Edward Petherbridge has only two parts, but makes such a wonderful work as Newman Noggs, that he is one of the most memorable actors. His droopy, worried face is absolutely priceless!
There is a lot to listen in this version, it starts with the whole cast telling, what happened before Nicholas, Kate and their mother came to London to seek help from Uncle Ralph, in the beginning of other acts there are 'what has happened' -scenes (which are wonderful!) - and at times the actors comment or fill in the facts - and then again become clouds, walls, poor people watching in from behind the windows or rich people eating well inside the same windows. This is smooth working, flawless, yet clearly something that they love to do and have fun doing it. Everybody's been telling, how much they love John Woodvine as uncle Ralph, but I still want to praise him - and wonder about how effortlessly he becomes an opera singer and a few moments later appears again as Uncle Ralph. David Threlfall is a heart-breaking Smike, twisted from head to toe, o-u-t-cast whose only home is Nicholas. And Alun Armstrong deserves his place in the closing credits for more than alphabetical reasons, his Squeers is wonderful, horrible, hilarious as the whole Squeers family. He later appears as a drunken actor, who saves the day as king in 'Romeo and Juliet', the Crummles' production with happy endings for everyone. Men who play Cheeryble brothers looked so much alike that I had to check they weren't twins, but had completely different family names. And their fury was something to see: when they decide to take ultimate measures to lighten to work of their clerk, they threaten him with making him a partner.
I would still like to mention other Squeers: Lila Kaye, Mrs. Squeers and later Mrs. Crummles, both wonderful performances which I still remembered well after all these years, and Suzanne Bertish, who has to be admired and envied for such delicious, different parts as Fanny Squeers, Miss Snevellici and Peg Sliderskew, the old hag who has a big part in the happy ending.
And yes: the technical transfer to DVD could have been much better done. As wonderful as these actors are, we don't need to see their names so many times. But even if I had to skip and fast forward, this was still a delight. Dickens is one of my favourites and this is one of those very, very rare occasions, when one can say: the movie (or play) was as good as the original book.",1073433600,16,3154,4.54481546572935

HOWEVER...these disc are truly the most careless tranfer I have ever seen outside of the public domain. The broadway production was offered in 2 parts, each part contained 2 acts.  If you really wanted the full immersive experience you saw part one on a Saturday or Sunday Matinee, broke for dinner and returned that same night to complete the epic.  Some of the power of the piece comes in the cumulative effect of losing yourself in Dicken's world.  The original broadcast was similarly aired with no commercial interuptions (Thanks, I believe, to Exxon) over  four nights.  WHY then has A&E broken its 4 discs into hour long segments, each containing the begining and ending credits? (You can't skip these segments, only fast forward over them.)  The transfer, even on my 24"" TV looks like a VHS copy recorded on the economical speed, grainy and washed out.  Don't even try to play it on a large screen TV.  (I just read a review of their transfer of the Miss Marple series which makes similar complaints.)  It feels like A&E literally had some authoring house get a VHS copy of a copy of a copy from the store and record it as is.  I am very glad I bought this box set for 2 reasons.  1...

644452,4,6303416543,"I doubt if a filmed version of a play can ever produce the satisfaction of sitting in a theater as part of an engaged audience watching a wonderful drama unfold before ones eyes.  Nicholas Nickleby was a unique theatrical experience.  I am happy to have a record of it and the wonderful performances and creative staging that made it such a memorable day in the theater.
  The DVD would have been even more satisfactory if the audio had been more consistent.  I found considerable fluctuation in the sound levels.  Some of the actors dialects were also difficult to understand (how about subtitles?)  I also would have appreciated a list of the names of the actors and the parts that they played somewhere on one of the DVDs.
  All in all, this is a keeper.  A theatrical experience that was a joy to experience both first hand and through the DVD.",1042416000,13,848,4.593333333333334
644453,4,6303416543,"I thought that I was going to have to wait until Christmas to view the very expensive DVD Set which I hear is somewhat shorter than the VHS Set (and that's a bad thing). Then I found this movie in the library along with other A&E Programs. Needless to say, A&E brings out some of the best TV movies even if they didn't make them. All of the actors were amazing. Roger Rees was simply amazing as Nicholas and very pleasant to look at compared to Smike. I was a little repulsed by his appearance at first. I wanted to watch this video particularly because Alun Armstrong was in it. I wanted to hear him in a none singing role. He was the original Thenardier in Les Miserables (produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company). When I first heard his last lines in the first video, I was moved. I thought of showing the show to my mom since my dad doesn't have any patience but sadly that wasn't to be. We only got past the first video when Mom told me that she couldn't understand what they were saying. Naturally, because it was filmed in 1981 and everyone was British. I was shocked by the fact that no one laughed at the funny parts. The Crummles provided a lot of laughter. I noticed a lot of things that reminded me of Les Miserables: The Musical. For one thing, both shows had a unit set, the same director, were both hits, had songs in them, and were both award winners. I had to give this video four stars because the sound was a bit too clear. You could hear the footsteps and you could hear the units being moved off Watch this play anyway. When you're done with it, buy the script at the Dramatist's Play Service Website. It's two volumes long. You might want to buy the television cast recording. If you have to, buy the video set as well.",1034812800,,1743,4.284848484848485
644454,5,6303416543,"This is the absolute best production ever performed, without exception.
At first, I was a little daunted by the fact that it was nine hours long, but it didn't take long for me to become absolutely captivated.  To say that the performances of the RSC actors are spectacular is an understatement.  Between the 42 of them, they play hundreds of roles, and each one is a fully developed character that is completely different from the others they play.  (Sometimes it's even hard to tell two characters are played by the same actor.) The only two actors who play one character are Roger Rees (Nicholas) and David Threlfall (Smike), both of whom are absolutely wonderful in their roles.  Although of course the entire cast is too numerous to mention individually, big cheers go out to all of them, including Emily Richard (Nicholas' sister Kate), John Woodvine (their villainous uncle Ralph), Bob Peck (John Browdie and Sir Mulberry Hawk, two extremely different roles!), Suzanne Bertish (Fanny Squeers/Peg Sliderskew/Miss Snevellicci), and especially Edward Petherbridge, who plays Ralph's kindhearted clerk and Nicholas' friend, Newman Noggs.
One important warning, however: I do not recommend that you buy the DVD set.  A&E has done a lousy job of putting ""Nicholas Nickleby"" on DVD's.  There are some fantastic sequences that have been cut and some horrible errors that have been made (i.e. a character's voice echoing BEFORE he yells instead of AFTER; the fact that some really nice background music has been cut).  Although the majority of the play is still intact, I highly recommend purchasing the video set instead.
The only other drawback is that at approximately nine hours, ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is far too short.  :-)",1032998400,17,1724,5.132142857142857
644455,5,6303416543,"In 1980, 48 members of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company got together to develop a stage version of Charles Dickens' ""Nicholas Nickleby"".  The result was an astounding 8 hours of absolutely riveting, often downright hilarious theater.
Patrons were given the option of watching the show either over two nights, or in one day, starting at 1 in the afternoon, with a 2-hour intermission.  I was a teenager when I saw this show, and no fan of Charles Dickens, but not once did I find myself noticing the passage of time or looking anywhere but at the stage (and I saw it all in one day).
You may think that by buying the DVD, you'll be able to split the show over 4 nights.  Maybe you'll even have the willpower to do it.  If I were you, though, I'd settle in for the long haul, because you won't want to get up.
Even if for some incomprehensible reason you don't want to watch the entire show, there is one segment of the play which alone nearly justifies the price of the DVD. At the end of the first part (i.e., probably around the end of DVD 2), you get to see some of the world's finest Shakespearean actors perform their version of a sappy Victorian production of Romeo and Juliet, complete with a happy ending and a rousing ""Patriotic Chorus"" (a musical ode to England).  Interestingly, the song was also featured on an episode of ""West Wing"" last year.",1028592000,14,1358,4.481781376518219

Yes, it's Dickens and it's funny, sad, moving, and melodramatic...coincidences abound as they can only do in Victorian novels..and even if you can't stand reading the books, you will love every moment of this. Be prepared to give up a few nights (willingly) to savor every moment. And by the way, it's finally out on DVD, too!",1014163200,,473,4.642857142857143

All the reviews on this site agree on that,but Steve Landaus review for Amazon unfairly miscredits the artists most responsible for this incredible feat of storytelling. To say that Jim Landau directed the show is only true insofar as cameras were present at Londons Old Vic Theatre. The co-directors of the show and the men most responsible for Nicholas Nickleby are John Caird and Trevor Nunn the dynamic duo who directed another classic literary adaptation for the Royal Shakespeare Company five years later --""Les Miserables"".Buy this video--  eight hours is not enough!!!",1013472000,2,702,5.324324324324325

I am now in the process of reading the book (faster that I've ever read any novel of that size) and I assure one and all that it is already on my list of favorite books. Nicholas Nickleby is a work of art and this film should be watched by everyone who breathes, and maybe even those who don't. I have fallen in love with Nicholas. For that matter, every single actor is stunning. Newman Noggs is extraspecially wonderful! I haven't seen a movie in a very long time that has effected me this deeply. The fact that it's a filmed play only adds to its brilliance. I love the sudden shifts of the characters from their parts to narration, and the whole-cast summaries of each act are incredible. If it were possible to rate this 10 stars, or 100 for that matter, I would. This movie glows. As do I when I watch (or read) it.

It seems that that was a good investment, with used copies going now for $200. What's a mystery, though, is why this incredible show hasn't been reissued on DVD. Granted its visual quality is poorprobably the result of being shot on low res video back in the day, and poorly mastered to boot. Sadly, there can never be a Blu Ray of this, because it wasn't shot on film; even Super 16 would have been much better, let alone 35mm. I bet a lot of TV producers of that era now regret cheaping out by not shooting film. Oh, to see this in HD!

As for the show, it's one of those rare productions that give one of Dickens's sprawling tales the room it needs. It's dazzlingly acted by England's best theater actors. Fans of British TV will see literally dozens of familiar faces.

I have viewed it so many times. One relishes the nuances each performer works into multiple characters-- almost everyone in the cast plays many roles.
