8581721,1,B00CHAEU16,"Many ""films"" have been called ""The worst movie ever made"". PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE, ROBOT MONSTER, CREEPING TERROR, etc., are a few skull-scorchers that come to mind.  However, these schlock ""classics"" can all be endured while only causing minimal cranial scarring. THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN is a singularly deadening experience, causing spiritual death w/ no hope of resurrection. The history of this act of cinematic malfeasance may help us to understand the reason behind its rancid reputation. It began as a miserable movie called THE MADMEN OF MANDORAS (1963), about a secret group that preserves the Fuhrer's noggin in a jar, for future use in world conquest. As putrid as MADMEN was, it was still -somewhat- watchable. Then, years later (1968), some film students decided to create / add their own incredibly bad footage to this already terrible movie. These mismatched, highly anachronistic sequences blend in w/ the original, almost as well as a ukulele in a piano concerto! The result was / is the absurd delivery-system-for-soul-cancer we have before us today. The worst aspect of TSHB is the unfathomable dullness of it! This movie could easily cause any functioning brain to ignite. It should be sealed in lead, and launched into our sun. Of course, this would only cause our sun to die...",1491177600,,1382,5.034934497816594
