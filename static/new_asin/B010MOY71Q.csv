7314216,4,B010MOY71Q,"This is an erotic vampire comedy/spoof that has cheese and moves into the ""so bad its good"" realm. A 1,000 year old Chinese Vampire Aleta (Ange Maya) has a coven of daughters living in  Alhambra, California. The US government wants to employ her as a secret weapon while a Russian named Ivor Helsing (Garrett Brawith) wants to drive a stake through the ""wampire's"" heart so she won't prey on anymore ""wirgins."" He is aided by a psychic vampire detector (Laura Cotenescu) who he meets in a bar.

The acting was horribly bad and some of it was designed that way. Aleta had an odd Chinese-Romanian accent. Zachary Ryan Block who played Joerg Von Helsing in a rather lengthy flashback, was perhaps the worst of the lot and I laughed as he wailed over the death of his father. (Sorry for that plot spoiler.)

The film includes a cleavage cam at one point and breaks down into a split screen musical number at another. It was enjoyable for all the wrong reasons.

7314218,4,B010MOY71Q,Kick-ass campy fun low budget horror film - with a lot of naked vampires! Complete with flashbacks to ancient China (in Mandarin with English subtitles) and a song and dance number between Secret Service agents and sexy vampire minions.

8722682,3,B010MOY71Q,Ange Maya added a little something extra to this horror comedy about an Asian vampire with a love for virgin blood.  The SecDef tries to do business with her and then finds it wasn't such a swift idea.  Plenty of bare ta-ta's.,1516665600,2,226,4.357142857142857

8722685,5,B010MOY71Q,"Without a doubt this is one of the most entertaining movies my wife and I have watched in the past few years. It has all the elements of a camp horror film: poor plotting, tortured acting, unsexy sex scenes, bad lighting and bad editing. Just when you think the movie will collapse on its own awfulness, they break into song. A brilliant move that had my wife and I laughing out loud. I even went back and replayed the song for her later. Make sure you read the IMDB bio of Ms Maya.",1468713600,6,482,4.193548387096774
