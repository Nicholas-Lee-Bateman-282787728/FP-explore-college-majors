2646541,5,B000HWZ4G6,"Pinky and Brain is a great political satire cartoon about two mice. one mouse has incredible inteligence called brain who wants to control the world. his assistant pinky not quite so inteligent and accident prone foils brain's attempt at world domination. i watched all of pinky and brain cartoons when they came out on television in 1995. very funny, witty, and political. these cartoons are up there with the classic pink panther cartoons, tom and jerry, and looney toons. i would love to see pinky and brain to take over the world in these cartoons. i would question though if brain did take over the world what would he do?

  what would brain turn into. would he be the little mouse that roared? would he be a dictator?  i know one thing the world's cheese would be a monopoly under pinky and brain.",1165190400,10,804,4.601398601398602

2646573,5,B000HWZ4G6,Anyone who has seen Steven Spielberg's cartoon series of Pinky and the Brain knows that each is a commentary on society. Wonderful series for children and adults.,1171324800,,162,5.037037037037037
2646574,3,B000HWZ4G6,"Love the show, but [yes, this is ironic] the cartoon is coming up too pink on my system [CyberHome DVD and Toshiba HD-TV]. All of my video set-up is well calibrated, so I'm pretty sure its the DVD. So far I've only watched the first two episodes, maybe later ones will be better...",1171324800,,281,4.320754716981132

2646576,5,B000HWZ4G6,"A few years ago I watched 'Pinky and the Brain' with my Grandson.  I enjoyed it as much as he did.  When I saw it was out on DVD, I knew I had to have it.  Now my Grandson and I are enjoying it all over again.",1169164800,2,209,3.404255319148936
2646577,5,B000HWZ4G6,"It has been a long time since Pinky and the Brain tried to take over the world.  But it's good to see them in action.  The effect of the show builds as one watches the episodes back to back.

The gags and visuals merit watching over and over and over and... well you get the idea.  Nothing is off limits for them to lampoon.  Cher, world leaders (especially Bill Clinton), Sadam, time travel, the Bible, Judge Ito, George Lucas, their staff writers, and even themselves.  The scary thing is that their plans start making sense, after a while.  To catch everything, you have to have a good understanding of American culture in the 1990's, and watch each episode a dozen times.  And make sure you catch the credits, it will help you when you watch the episode AGAIN...

Are you pondering what I'm pondering?  This is a must have!",1169078400,3,827,4.489932885906041

2646581,4,B000HWZ4G6,"I love waking up saturday mornings and putting on a couple of the episodes. Cartoons of this quality just don't exist anymore, which is a shame.

8141970,5,B000HWZ4G6,"This collection is nothing short of side-splitting humor. Sure, kids love it for its slapstick silliness. That said, there are so many laughs between the lines for adults you may die laughing (not a bad way to go).

Watch one or two at a time as more in one sitting is difficult to withstand. It's a meal to be eaten slowly.

For pure laughs, this is a not to be missed collection.",1202860800,,381,4.277777777777778

8141972,5,B000HWZ4G6,"I used to see this on television and LOVED it.  The cartoons definitely have the physical humor to appeal to children, and the dialogue to appeal to adults.

It is formula driven, BUT, the writing and the animation are superb.

I like that the producers have begun offering all the episodes in DVD sets. It is a welcome addition to my library.

Don't hesitate if you appreciate good writing, historical references, contemporary references, fantastic animation!",1178409600,,460,5.093333333333334
8141973,5,B000HWZ4G6,"YES! I couldn't wait to relive the days of this great cartoon series. The animation may have been for the kids, but the social and political comments and references are definitely for the adults. And hysterically funny. Both volumes are very nicely boxed and the discs have extras. Volume 3 is available for pre-order, and that's great news!",1174780800,3,341,4.896551724137931

A must for any fan. The best part (really!) is the extra material with Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen -- they are as intelligent, witty and friendly with each other as you'd ever hope. Restores your faith in humanity.",1174780800,4,307,4.7924528301886795
8141975,5,B000HWZ4G6,"It's hard to believe, but for a short time in the mid-1990's, there was a prime-time TV show about two cartoon lab mice trying to take over the world.  I expect to have a hard time convincing my future grandchildren that I really lived through such an incredible, magical time, but it's true.

That being said, I'm not sure how much the quality of the show benefited from the prime-time slot.  For one thing, the Brain's sarcastic put-downs of Pinky got a little more mean-spirited in nature - possibly because the writers thought that they needed the extra ""edge"" in order to ""make it"" in prime-time. (They were wrong, as it turned out, because the show was eventually taken out of prime time and put back in the weekend kids' lineup).

I also thought that the addition of the Snowball character hurt the show.  One of the things I like best about Warner Brothers cartoons is the complete absence of the clear-cut, black-and-white morality that is so characteristic of Disney cartoons.  For example, Wily E. Coyote doesn't try to eat the Roadrunner because he's bad or evil - he just does it because he's a coyote, and as a coyote, it's his nature to try to eat roadrunners.  Similarly, the Brain doesn't try to take over the world because he's evil - it's just his nature to try to take over the world.  Snowball kind of wrecked that formula, because Snowball actually WAS unremittingly evil.  Fortunately, Snowball was only in a handful of episodes.

Overall, though, Pinky and the Brain was a pretty amazingly awesome show. I mean, where else could you watch two lab mice comment on history, human nature, and popular culture while trying to take over the world? And for those of us fortunate enough to have been alive for that brief period in the mid-1990's when it appeared that Pinky and the Brain just might take over the world, this is an incredible reminder of those historic days.
