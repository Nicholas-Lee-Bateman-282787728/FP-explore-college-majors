1614865,3,B00005JLQT,"I just went to see this movie yesterday. I really didn't expect a lot out of the movie since next Friday wasn't that good but surprisingly it had some laughs. In this one Craig and Day-Day have moved into an apart complex back in the hood. Someone who is portarying SantaClaus(you will find out this guy was a comedian on comicview) breaks into there apartment and takes their rent money. The landlord lady tells them that if they don't have the rent money at the end of the day she will put them out and also hand them over to her Ex-con son Damon who has developed a taste for men while incarcerated. Craig and Day-Day have to get a job as security officers at this shopping plaza in town. They end up losing those jobs and have to throw a ""rent"" party to raise the money. I want go into dedtails about the movie but I will say that the character MoneyMike is halarious along with the old guy with the shotgun at the end of the movie. I think that overall it was better than Next Friday but of course it isn't like the 1st Fiday movie.",1038009600,3,1037,4.21608040201005

1614917,1,B00005JLQT,This is definately not a family movie. I don't understand all the praise for it....very vulgar and trashy....if you like that then it gets 5 stahhrs for trash....I don't get into it so 5 minutes was my limit....that was enough to hear every cuss word known to man and to fill your childrens heads with enough sexual content to ruin any innocence they may have.,1511481600,,360,4.553846153846154

Craigs entire family are here, engaged in antics wild and crazy enough to make anyone roll with laughter. The whole ""Bro's Bar-B-Q"" scene alone, makes this a film not to miss. I watched this film again, while visiting friends in the Philippines. And the Filipinos laughed eved harder than my American friends did! It seems that Ice cube's movies are a big hit all over the world. So I say get yourself a copy of ""Friday After Next"", and invite some friends over to watch it.

Craig and DayDay are living in an apartment a California ghetto.  THey endure the typical trials and tribulations of single living - paying the rent on time, working, etc. - but put the urban spin on everything.  THeir house is broken into by Santa, their landlady (with a moustache problem that really bothers me) is harrassing them, and her enourmous son has just been released from prison and wants a piece of them.  At their jobs at the strip mall we meet an entire separate cast with their family barbeque restaurant (""Bring your big ass down here! Tastes so good, make you wanna slap yo mamma!""), the Holy Moly Donut Shop, and the Pimps n' Hos store.  Hilarity unfolds in drug humor, physical comedy, and innuendo.

The pimp at the Pimps n' Hos shop stole the show once he was introduced.  The cute little man with the Napoleonic Complex who wants to be a tough guy.  It's a scream!  With the pink limos, skanks, and urban mentality, this is one rip roaring good time.

the plot is deeper

more twisted

more funny

more senseless

so no one slam him

he is an amazing film maker

considering he used to star in movies

when he can star in one and create it

that's innovative

he does good at starring and making movies

give him props people

Money is just plain funny.  You know he's real earnest about pimpin' if he's taking meetings with the Bishop!  I'd give it 4 stars if Cube would lose the urge to have people shooting at the end again, which is what turned me off on the first one.

1615342,3,B00005JLQT,"Friday After Next is basically the original Friday with less laughs. The end resullt is a movie that is okay, but you expected a bit more, kind of like what you expected in Next Friday, a but more. Friday After Next is about Ice Cube and Mike Epps moving back into the hood in an apartment complex. 2 nights before christmas there presents are stolen and they are left with no rent money or presents to give each other (or whoever they were plannin on givin them to.) The robber is a masked Santa Clause who is a person who has been stealing christmas presents from famalies for his own use.
When I first heard of the movie, my frirst impression was to see it. However the ""cristmas theme"" brought me to skipping it and watching it on dvd. Too bad that I waited so long and didn't see it till last night cause this movie is not one to sleep on, or skip for that matter. The movie, is for the most part a funny movie. However after watching the first 2 you'd expcet a little more from this franchise, like more laughs and funnier ones at that. There are plenty of laugh from Epps however and creates the humor in the movie. Acting is done very well in the movie.  Epps for example makes you believe that will go crazy if he has some authority. It doesn't seem like he's trying to be funny, it seems like he's exactly like that. The new characters (like the homosexual or Money Mike - the pimp) don't look like there acting, and if they are there doing a reallygood job. The homosexual does seem like he is a homosexual and money mike does have all the aspects to be a pimp. This is something that at the moment makes the movie just that more funny.
There are only a few things bad from the movie. One is that Ice Cube seems to not have progressed as an actor since the first movie. Is still the same old Ice cube and all of his moves in ths movie are widely expected. Also the fact that the rest of the family is not recognized during the movie. Sure there are afew scenes containing his family but actors like John Witherspoon deserve a much bigger role in the movie. More lines, and more to do with the plot.
All in all Friday After Next is a god movie, not one to pass, but is only worth a rent. 3 stars for the lack of more humor and suppporting roles from the family",1070150400,,2270,4.1826484018264845
1615343,1,B00005JLQT,"""Friday After Next"" tries to be both a successful addition to the Friday series and an effective ""holiday in the hood"" movie and by all means, fails at both. Ice Cube reprises his role as both writer and actor for this very dissapointing third installment.
Craig and his cousin, Day-Day have moved back to South Central where they work as rent-a-cops at a shopping plaza on Christmas Eve. With their rent money stolen by an evil Santa Claus the night before, they need to come up on some quick cash and fast. With Day-Day's buffonish antics getting the duo in some serious trouble with their equaly-goofy boss who runs a donut shop at the plaza, they may be out of a job before the day ends.
""Friday After Next"" is such a poor effort at continuing what was once a decent comedy franchise. Cube is just as solid a ""straight man"" as he was in the first film but his supporting cast has gotten noticeably weaker. Giving Mike Epps more to do and say doesn't help this movie either. Fifteen minutes into it, I was practically begging for Chris Tucker. Terry Crews as the muscle-bound bully plays like a watered-down version of Tiny Lister's ""Deebo"" with a painfully unfunny and uncreative ""prison homsexual"" gimmick thrown on. The joke never dies and dramatized scenes of the character raping another male character in the bathroom for the sake of humor are about as low brow as you can get. There are a few funny lines here and there (enough to fit into one of the ads) but all of the absolutetly dumb and stereotypical characters kill what little humor there is. Cube's script is about as uninspired as you get. Did anyone notice there are at least two or three characters who serve the same purpose as one another?
""Friday After Next"" brings a lot of special features to a movie that in all honesty is not nearly worth the effort. If you are a fan of the Friday trilogy, the DVD may be worth it for the features but your best bet is to act like this movie doesn't exist. If as much time and effort was brought to making the movie as was the DVD, it might have made for something worthwhile.",1070064000,3,2088,4.468586387434555

Not only did the robber steal their Christmas gifts, but he also stole their rent money, which is, of course, due the next day. Thus begins a Friday filled with things going wrong and seeing just how crazy people can be.
While there are some very funny moments in the film, it somewhat falls flat. Ice Cube and Mike Epps are very good together as Craig and Day Day, but many of the other characters start off as funny and then become annoying.

1615393,4,B00005JLQT,"Let's face it, the first one was the best.  It came out of nowhere and became a decent hit which has grown into cult status in a very short amount of time.  Chris Tucker and Ice Cube were perfectly matched and had a chemistry so palpable which made for a very enjoyable ride.  Then, inexplicably Chris Tucker didn't appear in the sequel ""Next Friday"" (it was probably his choice not to return after the success of Rush Hour) and he was sorely missed.  This second outing in the trilogy was boring beyond belief and, even though I had tried, I couldn't bring myself to like it.
  Then, I had pretty much given up on the whole Friday thing until a friend of mine recommended that I rent this next installement.  He told me he found it very funny and, not really knowing what to expect, I gave it a try.  I must say my confidence was restored in the Friday potential and, even though this third act is not as great as it could have been, I found myself enjoying it quite a lot.

  True, I am like most fans of Friday who all wish ""Smokey"" would come back.  Chris Tucker made this role so memorable that everytime we get a new one, most of us secretly hope he'll be around.  Well, no luck here either even though Mike Epps is doing quite a good job and is very funny in this.  John Witherspoon as the father is always hilarious to watch and I found myself captivated by the pimp character, dressed in flamboyant costumes with an attitude to match.  He was probably the best new character in the film in my opinion along with the new big tug around the block involved in a delicious storyline with homoerotic overtones.
  My one regret about the Friday movies is the fact that Ice Cube doesn't give us the whole family anymore.  What made the first one so enjoyable was the fact that they were all part of the scheme of things but now, we never get to see Craig's sister and his mother is only featured in a small thankless role.  Frankly, she deserves much better.
  There are some very nice gags and I laughed out loud at many of them.  I must say I don't really care much for the infinifilm gimmick where you see the film as different options to watch the behind the scenes stuff became available all throughout.  I either want to watch the movie without interruption or watch the special features and mixing the two is not my idea of fun.  But maybe that's just me.
  In conclusion, this third one is a good effort.  It also made me hopeful that the fourth one (I am pretty sure there will be one according to what the actors said in the documentaries) will be even better, if we can finally have the chance to see every member of the family have a bigger part in the story.  Good comedy worth a shot!",1053734400,11,2700,4.293069306930693

Again we have Mike Epps who still isn't funny and who still doesn't have chemistry with Ice Cube.  They got way too outlandish with this one just like Next Friday, they tried too hard to outdo the first one which of course didn't work, both movies just came off as being stupid.  It's best if you just stick to the first Friday and forget about these atrocious sequels.",1049673600,2,542,4.233009708737864

1615398,3,B00005JLQT,"Eventhough I haven't seen Friday After Next because of some bad publicity and negative comments which led me initially not to watch Next Friday.  Comedy sequels always are not as good as the originals.  The original Friday no doubt is one of the top ten comedies of all time, period.  But I think because Chris Tucker didn't come back for Next Friday, people automatically assumed or thought that it wasn't as funny.  Well, after looking at the movie for what it was, a different story line and movie from the originally Friday, Next Friday in all honesty was just as hilarious.  Donald ""DC"" Curry (Cubes Uncle Elroy) and Mike Epps (Day-Day) added a different twist to the Friday story and those two were hilarious as hell.  Then throw in the drug smugglin ""Essays"" next door and of course Debo and his brother stalking Ice Cube throughout, Next Friday turned out to be a really funny movie.  It definitely isn't as funny as the original Friday, then again, what comedy sequel is as good as the original (Okay, American Pie 2 may get my vote for that).  So I will take the same approach for Friday After Next when it comes out on DVD.  I'll watch it as if there were no prequels and judge it based on that.  People should stop dissing Next Friday cuz it was hilarious without having to bite too much from the original movie.  Plus, I like it a whole lot better than All About The Benjamins.",1048464000,,1390,4.49800796812749

1615413,4,B00005JLQT,"Ok-I have never seen the original ""Friday"". Though I plan to...soon. I saw ""Next Friday"" and enjoyed it, so I saw this. It had more laughs then ""Next Friday"", but not as interesting of plot...if there is any at all. But who sees a Friday movie for plot? I don't...
I'm not a rap fan, so I don't like Ice Cube, but I enjoy his movies. So far I've seen this, ""Barbershop and ""Next Friday"". He's a great actor, and obviously very talented: he wrote and produced this movie. And whoever came up with Money Mike is brilliant. You know Money Mike! The PIMP! One of the few new characters in this movie, he almost steals the show. He's definely the most funny.
The movie takes place on Christmas Eve in ""the hood"". While Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) are napping, a thief dressed as Santa Claus breaks in and steals all their Christmas gifts. Craig wakes and tries to stop him; Day-Day keeps dreaming of fat ... . The next day, they call the police, and while the cops are trying to slove the crime, Craig and Day-Day go off to their new jobs as mall security guards, which Day-Day of course takes very seriously. Knowing they have to pay off their apartment money collector, they work extra hard to get the money they would've had if Santa didn't take it along with the gifts. And if they don't, they have to see Damon, who later on in the movie gets the hots for Money Mike...
This is a good movie, and I'd see it if you enjoy stupid comedies, even if you aren't an Ice Cube fan (as I said before, I'm not).",1040169600,,1513,4.275261324041812
1615414,4,B00005JLQT,"Friday After Next is a big improvement over the previous one, Next Friday, but nothing special compared to the original.
I thought that the guy who played the burglar dressed up as Santa Claus was funny, ""Where's the milk and cookies.""
Unfortunately, there's no Smokey or Deebo in this movie (I didn't think that Deebo was as good on Next Friday as he was in the original).
This movie needs more attention than what it gets so do yourselves a favor, if you got $7.50 to spare, go watch this movie and don't listen to the negative reviews cause it is a good movie, if you cannot afford to see a movie at the theater, at least go rent it.",1039996800,4,636,4.308333333333334

1615417,4,B00005JLQT,"1995's `Friday' was a laid back, pot-smoking comedy that felt like a long summer day with nothing to do. 2000's `Next Friday,' upped the pace and changed the focus, but still remained a leisurely affair. The new `Friday After Next,' is something else entirely - if they ever need a cure for narcolepsy, this is the film to study. An aggressively paced, rowdy sequel that never, ever stops, `Friday After Next' takes the series in an entirely new direction: out of control.
Back in the hood after spending some time with his Uncle Elroy (Don `DC' Curry) in the suburbs, Craig (Ice Cube), and his cousin Day Day (Mike Epps), are suffering through a lousy Christmas holiday when their presents and rent money are stolen by a robber dressed as Santa. Forced back into the working world, the two get jobs as security men at a local strip mall. `Friday After Next' details Craig and Day Day's first Friday on the job, as they dodge an evil landlord (Bebe Drake), disrupt holiday carols from some old ladies, meet gorgeous women (including K.D. Aubert), thwart some crackhead shoplifters, get yelled at by their middle-eastern boss (Maz Jobrani), and plan a party that will bring holiday cheer to all.
I must give credit to writer/producer/star Ice Cube for taking the sporadically funny, message-minded comedy in `Friday,' and turning it into the viable comedic franchise that it is today. `Next Friday' was a such a marked improvement over the original, that hopes were high for Cube to top himself with this new installment. But while Cube did up the ante here, he upped it in all the wrong places. Like a bat out of hell, `Friday After Next' is such a cyclone of jokes, characters, situations, and general visual nonsense, that one needs a seat belt and current physical just to keep up. It's rather insane how fast this movie flows, not just in pace, but also in material to handle. Cube has thrown everything he could into this production, and without much of an attempt to sort it all out, this new `Friday' isn't quite as successful as the last one.
That's not to say there isn't fun to be had. I enjoy how Cube writes all the action for one location, and then allows the insanity to build throughout the day. His ear for urban silliness is just as eagerly welcomed. But `Friday After Next' simply gets away from him, spinning deliriously through prison sex jokes, female facial hair gags, holiday trimmings, L.A.P.D. razzings (one officer's badge name simply reads `A. Hole'), returning characters from `Next Friday,' Cube and Epps's own shockingly limp interplay, and landing at the climactic party where the comedy explodes like a bomb sending little bits of funny shrapnel everywhere. I laughed a lot at `Friday After Next,' but I spent as much time wondering where the brakes were on this thing.
The golden goose of `Next Friday' was the introduction of comedian Mike Epps. In replacing the monotonous Chris Tucker as Cube's sidekick, Epps infused the `Friday' series with a new playfulness, and a willingness to get a little silly for the laughs. Epps was comic perfection in `Next Friday' (as he was in his other Cube collaboration, `All About The Benjamins'), but `Friday After Next' plays at such an obscenely high pitch, that it drowns out what Epps has to offer. He resorts to yelling just to be heard. Thankfully, to help Epps out, there is hilarious supporting work from Katt Micah Williams at Money Mike, a Prince-lookalike, high maintenance pimp, Terry Crews as sexually liberated parolee Damon (who has his eye, and other body parts, on Money Mike), and the always reliable John Witherspoon as Craig's intestinally-challenged father. As much as I wanted to enjoy Epps this time around, he just isn't a match for the sheer velocity of this chapter.
I doubt any hardcore fans of `Friday' will recognize their beloved film in this second sequel. And while there are enough laughs to go around, I think someone needs to drop a sedative in Ice Cube's coffee before we're subjected to a potentially strobe-like `Friday After Friday After Next.",1038441600,2,4054,4.8261494252873565
