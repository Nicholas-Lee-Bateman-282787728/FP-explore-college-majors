5015424,4,B006SRHXOK,"A teenage girl struggles with an obsessive sexual nature in this Norwegian film. She becomes an outcast in her school, and the mother is concerned about her daughter's odd behavior. This movie portrays real-life problems that kids have to deal with in any nation, so American kids should appreciate it. The movie approaches the borderline of inappropriate content without crossing it. These could be high school girls in any movie made here in American film, as they deal with peer pressure, sex, and trying to fit in with their classmates. This is a good movie for those that like to see quality foreign films.",1340841600,14,611,4.884615384615385
5015425,4,B006SRHXOK,"In the opening scene of this refreshing movie that addresses adolescent sexuality from a girl's perspective, the lead character,  Alma (Helene Bergscholm) , a 15-year-old teenager, is lying on a kitchen table and pleasuring herself to phone sex. This sets the scene for the rest of the movie which explores Alma's desires, her raging hormones, and her sexual awakening. (Note: The film is in Norwegian with English subtitles as an option, and there are some explicit scenes).

Alma's sexual escapades are explored with unabashed frankness, and the sex scenes are credibly dealt with. Alma's hormones are depicted as being totally off kilter to the point that sex is all she thinks about, ""I want a hammer inside of me..."" You get the picture. But then an encounter with a local boy changes things in Alma's life and she becomes the talk of the town, and not in a good way. The local kids call her ""Dick Alma"", and the girl becomes a social pariah.

It might be a bit shocking for some viewers because this is after all a 15-year-old girl who is depicted smoking hash cigarettes and drinking alcohol, but the issues dealt with are very real, and are explored in a realistic, down-to-earth manner. This film is very different to what one comes across in Hollywood films. Movies like American Pie dealt with adolescent sexuality from a boy's point of view, and a slew of Hollywood movies have explored the subject, but mainly from the male perspective. This is why ""Turn Me On, Dammit!"" is unique, as it doesn't shy away from portraying female sexuality with a level of candidness not common in American cinema. There's drama and humor aplenty, and the wonderful performance by the lead actress makes this a noteworthy production well-worth one's time.",1378166400,3,1749,4.8624161073825505

5015429,5,B006SRHXOK,"This  teen comedy from Sweden is really good. The young cast are just right sullen, brash, frustrated and funny. This movie benefits from having a great script. The story is simple the kids just want to get out of their hick town and get laid. The adult characters are realistic the humour is droll. I loved this 'small' movie, so much better than some of the crass and unfunny hollywood teen flicks. Loved it!",1360540800,2,410,4.54054054054054

5015431,5,B006SRHXOK,"Watching on ""Turn Me On, Dammit!"" was like reliving my sexually awkward, emotional charged high school years through the eyes of a young foreign girl.  I know, it sounds strange, but that was the beauty of it.  The universality of the feelings which permeated my formative years are honestly portrayed by the writing, directing and excellent acting.  I did not have to speak the language to understand this awesome ""cumming"" of age story.",1352764800,,438,4.972602739726027

5015434,5,B006SRHXOK,"Finally here is a wonderful film about the trials and tribulations of a teenage girl and her desire.  It's really no wonder that the critics (94% Certified Fresh Rating at Rotten Tomatoes) have warmly embraced ""Turn Me On Dammit"" because there really is no american film like it. The originality the critics have embraced is based on the fresh perspective of the director (a woman of course) who gracefully tells the story of a teenage girl who struggles with her sexual fustrations and her relationships. I encourage all women (and everyone else) to check out this fresh take on growing up as a teenage girl. As a teenager it does not matter if you are a woman or a man because this is an experience that is universal.",1344384000,14,719,4.6171875
8503803,2,B006SRHXOK,"I've never been so bored for a straight 75 minutes than I was watching this idiotic movie. I'm always suspicious of any film like this lousy Norwegian entry that receives praise from outfits like the Tribeca Film Festival or the Cannes Film Festival. I'm a fan of most films from Europe especially from Sweden, France and Norway but every so often there is a bad one and this film falls into that category. If you like wasting 75 minutes of your life then this film is just what you're looking for.",1485043200,,498,4.483516483516484

I can compare parts of the story line with the best of American television comedy. . .specifically ""Seinfeld"" and ""The Big Bang Theory.""  The performance of Helene Bergsholm and the other female characters were outstanding with carrying the story line and plot.

8503807,5,B006SRHXOK,"One of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. The story itself isn't new but it's just a different view: a girl just trying to fit in, be popular. Being a teen and being confused about your sexuality and urges. Trying to get the attention of the certain boy...it's the same all over the world. Having a frustrating mother and that overly nosy neighbor.... Argh! I highly recommend this movie.",1434585600,2,400,4.493150684931507

Story line doesn't flow. The ending is totally contrived and makes no sense since there is NO foreshadowing at all. 3 stars for the novelty factor.",1384300800,,301,4.69811320754717
8503809,1,B006SRHXOK,"RIPOFF ALERT:

I don't know who wrote the OTHER Reviews, but they obviously didn't watch the same rip-off DVD I purchased here for 20+ Dollars. Or, they are ""planted"" reviews by the seller.

I wasn't expecting Porn. But I was expecting to get 20 dollars worth of interest.  This is a typical TEASER DVD that taunts you with a seductive description, and then the other phoney Reviews reinforce that perception. Then you discover, that you have been had, and someone is laughing all the way to the bank.

Don't waste your money on this scam. It shows nothing, and is all baloney innuendo, filled with staged masturbation scenes, that show the girl's face, as she pretends to be doing the act.  All TEASE, and nothing on this disk is even worth 5 bucks.

Shame on Amazon.",1383091200,4,768,4.610294117647059
8503810,4,B006SRHXOK,"The subject matter here is tricky, and this could have turned out to be something tacky. However, the characters were charming and there was nothing salacious about this movie.",1382313600,,176,5.103448275862069
8503811,2,B006SRHXOK,"Since so many fans say this is a ""revolutionary comedy"" and a ""teenage sexual farce,"" I was expecting more laughs. But it really is more of a drama. Yes, our teenage heroine is obsessed with masturbation and sexual fantasies, perhaps more so than the average teen (but perhaps not, I'm not sure), but that is actually a secondary theme. The primary theme is Alma's complete and cruel social exclusion from everyone in town because she is a ""pervert."" Oh no, she's not a pervert because of her sexual obsessions.

The people in this small town think Alma is a pervert because she told the truth about a boy at school who briefly touched Alma with his genitals. Alma wasn't upset about it or anything; she just decided to tell people about it. Oddly enough, this was a boy she liked and fantasized about, so it makes you wonder why she decided to blab about the encounter. The boy denied that he had done it; everyone believed him and noboby believed Alma, and so from that point on Alma was designated a ""pervert"" who should be completely and utterly banished from any and all social interactions. And that, believe it or not, comprises the bulk of this story. It is NEVER made clear why everyone at school would regard Alma as a pervert worthy of total exclusion, even if she was lying. Teens lie all the time, just like the rest of us. :-)

The only person who knows about Alma's obsession with masturbation is her mother, because Alma makes a lot of noise when Mom is around. Solution: Mom wears earplugs. And Alma makes very expensive phone calls to a sex talk service. Solution: Mom tells Alma she has to work a parttime job to pay the phone bills. Look, I know this sounds like it might be funny, but in this movie it's all straight and serious. Maybe this is some kind of understated humor? If it is, I think it's too understated. Mom thinks there is something seriously wrong with Alma. The mother is loving and kind, but she's really quite clueless. Don't expect any meaningful heart-to-heart talks between mother and daughter. At no point do mother and daughter talk about sex, or anything else for that matter. As far as acting goes, the mother is good at giving Alma blank, uncomprehending stares. If Oscars were awarded for such stares, she'd win one.

There's more going on with Alma and the other teens at school. Using drugs and drinking alcohol seem to be a favorite pastime. Given the bucolic scenery and the fresh, clean faces of the teens this is a bit of a surprise. They are bored with small-town life, that much is clear. And that's fine, but these teens are obviously middle-class or higher and the movie doesn't tell us how difficult or easy it is for them to escape from small-town life if that is what they want to do. We don't learn anything about social mobility in Norway. As far as aspirations go, the only one we hear about is the desire to emigrate to Texas in order to protest capital punishment. And that's fine, too, except you can't make a living doing that. And yes, I know that Norwegian girls protesting capital punishment in Texas sounds funny, but the movie makes it all so serious and earnest that it isn't funny. Neither does Alma care at all about school and she doesn't hesitate to use profanity against her teachers. We never learn why the otherwise sweet Alma shows such blatant disrespect for her teachers, or why the teachers put up with it. Alma's mother seems to be totally unaware of Alma's problems at school. Or maybe she is and they simply don't talk about it. Is this how it is in Norway? If that's the case, it's no wonder The Beach Boys sang ""I wish they all could be California girls."" :-)

I've told you all of this and yet I've not given away any spoilers. If I told you how everything resolves in the end that might be a spoiler, so I won't do that. But there's nothing special or funny about the final resolution.

If this film makes you laugh, good for you! There are a couple of amusing scenes. The opening scene is the funniest: the expressions on the dog's face as he watches Alma are the best part of this movie. I'd like to know how they got the dog to do it. The dog would win an Oscar, too.",1381708800,2,4161,4.4625492772667545
8503812,4,B006SRHXOK,"Primarily a coming-of-age comedy, ""Turn Me On, Dammit!"" is an engaging little film (only 76 minutes) from Norway. Seldom does a film capture the frustrated feelings of the teenage girls stuck in a stagnant community, without making the story preachy or depressing.

The story itself is simple. It is about a 15-year-old girl Alma (Helene Bergsholm), bored with life in a fictional Norwegian rural town Skoddeheimen. Alma is frequently daydreaming about sexual situations, especially that with her friend Artur (Matias Myren), with whom she has a crush on.

Because of one shocking incident that happened during a dance party (related to sex, of course), Alma is virtually ostracized in school. Only her best friend Sara (Malin Bjrhovde), frequently writing letters to death row inmates in Texas, seems to understand her plight.

Alma (and we) is finally given an opportunity to look at the whole things from a different perspective. Though some may find the conclusion too good to be true, I think it is very realistic. Though ""Turn Me On, Dammit!"" is about heterosexual love, its light-hearted tone (with the story and characters firmly rooted in reality) reminds me of a Swedish masterpiece ""Show Me Love.""

There is nothing exploitative about Alma's sexual fantasy. The delicate subject is handled with great sensitivity, and the film's understated message is a positive one.",1378166400,,1378,5.221719457013575
