5471613,5,B00AQNQRDK,"This was a very tender story with some excellent acting (the cowboy grandfather in particular and Ayla Brown) and caused me to suspend disbelief (my test of a good movie).  And I had to wipe my eyes when it was over.  Well directed, well shot, well edited and lots of excellent western music.  It's a great family movie.",1357344000,,320,4.482758620689655
5471614,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Cowboy Spirit is a a terrific movie for all ages. You don't have to be a cowboy to appreciate it...you just have to have a heart! Have kleenex on hand as it does pull on your heart strings. Good for younger kids to realize how much they learn from their grandparents without even being aware of it. I love a movie that has a moral to the story, and this is it! Being kind to others...karma...they all play a part. And of course the Cowboy Spirit is the kind of spirit everyone needs. Do buy it, watch it, share it...you won't regret it!",1357344000,4,536,4.213592233009709
5471615,5,B00AQNQRDK,"I just think this is the movie of the year.  Beautifully written, filmed and acted, a wonderfully touching story with some great action. It proves what a great job can be done on a low budget, I enjoyed it enormously. Congratulations to all involved in the making of it.",1357344000,,270,4.510204081632653

5471621,2,B00AQNQRDK,"I think the grandfather is somewhat harsh and doctrinaire about the 'rules' that govern the cowboy life. Maybe he should learn that life is lived best when love is the guiding principle, instead of tripe like 'a cowboy doesn't leave his hat on the bed'. That said, the hero is the young man who yearns to live a principled life -- its simply unfortunate that his understanding of principle is based on concepts suited for display at a rodeo, but insufficient to deal with the full range of life experience, like sticking up for people in danger, or following ethical practices in his business and legal affairs.",1419897600,,611,4.719626168224299
5471622,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Fast shipping. This movie could have been a lot better if it was in the hands of a good director and production. The filming was especially bad in spots. However its worth watching. I always liked foreordained movies. Rent or buy Sam Peckinpahs ""Junior Bonner"". Can not go wrong.",1409788800,,279,4.714285714285714

5471624,5,B00AQNQRDK,very good movie i enjoyed the part where the bullrider as a little boy his grandfather teaching him that reminded me of when i was a kid,1408147200,,136,4.074074074074074
5471625,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Great movie. For me this movie was a must see, even before I knew that several of the actors were co-workers, and the fact that I love everything horses. If it has a horse in it, I watch it!  This movie was very touching and brings to light childhood cancer and the enormous expense families have to incur to help save their child.  Keep up the good work Cowboy Spirit!",1362614400,,369,4.257142857142857
5471626,4,B00AQNQRDK,"The final moments of ""Cowboy Spirit""  (including the final inner dialog with grandfather) are excellent: The sequences of flashback to the younger hero with grandfather prepare very well for these moments. That the viewer may not see but must infer the outcome of bull riding competition and surgery is very effective. Just getting to the starting gate, whatever the outcomes, is a triumph for him and the viewer.

The hero's fiancee gradually realizes that his and her devotion to each other is insecure despite the fact that she has stayed with him through the trial, a commitment that makes credible his attraction to her in the first place. She feels (and he ultimately agrees) that he should not have risked being
prosecuted. She half realizes at the outset that his rescue mission will uproot his commitment to her. Her shift to her fiancee's buddy dramatizes her need to link with a partner who would call 911 (as the buddy did do). The narrative allows the viewer to see her as a villain, but also as a lover who couldn't support the risks he took. Having her attend the final competition is a nice touch.

That intervening to rescue an abused women being assaulted was as perilous as bull riding is nicely dramatized by the film; that both risks may have turned out to be survivable is very powerful.",1360454400,,1309,4.732456140350878
5471627,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Here's a movie that really makes you think about your values.  Interestingly, it's not really about horses, although the strands of the plot do come together at a rodeo.  The story had surprises, moving back and forth through time to show how a child's experiences shape later relationships.  No easy endings, either.  Think Urban Cowboy meets Wall St.  Very enjoyable and a nice job by all involved.",1359331200,,400,4.91044776119403
5471629,4,B00AQNQRDK,"Cowboy Spirit lifts your spirits and manages to succeed even though, ironically, it's a western shot partly around Boston.
The movie starts slowly, but once you get into it, Cowboy Spirit touches your heart as it tells the tale of a little girl who has an incurable cancer and a frustrated stock broker who wants to help pay for her surgery. He becomes the hero and falls in love with the girl's mother played by former American Idol singer Ayla Brown. Whip into the story rodeo action and bursts of country music, and you have a winner that's bound to rope you in.  Cowboy Spirit is not preachy but gets its message across. The movie is understated and develops like the low budget film ""The Station Agent"" where the sound track and low key acting make the movie. Cowboy Spirit is the type of western I watched as a kid when good finally triumphs over evil. Take the family to see it. It's light years away from Droids and video games.

5471630,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Cowboy Spirit has it all. Brilliant directing, flawless production design, a stellar cast, and an exquisitely captivating story about family, bravery, and fighting for what's right. Especially wonderful is Ayla Brown's performance. I've followed her career closely since her stint on American Idol and she has proven herself a real pro at everything she sets her mind to. Singing, acting, playing guitar, and anything else a solid entertainer is so determined to succeed at. This is one movie you have to see to believe. Whether you're a cowboy or cowgirl at heart or just love fantastic entertainment, I highly recommend this enormously moving work of art.",1358899200,,657,5.2075471698113205
5471631,5,B00AQNQRDK,"It is difficult to find a movie that you can share with kids that doesn't have bad language and suggestive scenes.  This movie is as wholesome as they come and brings to light some lessons in life that should be taken to heart by everyone.  The music adds another aspect for your enjoyment.  Congratulations to everyone involved,  especially Mike Allison,  a genuine Texas cowboy with many talents.",1358553600,,398,4.880597014925373
5471632,4,B00AQNQRDK,"The only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me was because of the acting by some (but not all!) of the volunteers.  The little girl, however, is a wonderful actor, even when she has no lines.  Her expressions are real and worth a thousand words.  Ayla Brown was another who impressed me.  She not only acted well, but wrote and sang her own songs.  My favorite, however, was the grandfather played by Mike Allison, who is also the writer and producer.  Watching this first effort by most of the people involved reminded me of when I saw Taylor Swift open for Brad Paisley in Omaha when she was 16.  I had never really heard of her before, but could tell she was going places and I predict the same for the Cowboy Spirit crew.  My favorite scene is the last and I love that the ending isn't all tied up in a pretty bow.  This a movie that will stick with you and I recommend it for all except for very young children.",1358208000,3,917,4.224137931034483
5471633,4,B00AQNQRDK,"Cowboy Spirit is an entertaining experience.  The Story is engaging, the soundtrack is great and the actors made us forget that we were watching a movie.  All the players did a great job and Ayla Brown showed that she is not just a great singer but was flawless in the lead female role. Don't look for flashy special effects, Alians or Super-Heroes in this film.  It's a great story about ordinary people facing extraordinary challenges.  The message is one that will stick with you.  Great for teens and adults, probably not for younger kids.",1357862400,3,543,4.73404255319149
5471634,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Bringing back family hour.  Touching story about family, love, loyalty.  I felt like I was a kid again watching a Sunday night movie with my family.  Hey Hollywood - watch this movie and bring back the meaningful story.  Wonderfully written, acted, shot & edited.",1357776000,,263,4.909090909090909
5471635,5,B00AQNQRDK,There is an honesty about this story with strong performances by a relatively unknown group of actors.  A family movie that features animals and kids can be a bit sappy--this movie is not and should appeal to a wide audience.  Well worth a viewing.,1357689600,,248,4.613636363636363
5471636,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Heroes, horses, rodeo action a villian, teary tender moments and great country music with Alya Brown, her acting was amazing, along with the other fine cast members. I just loved it and my husband did too!",1357516800,,205,4.722222222222222
5471637,5,B00AQNQRDK,This is a great movie.  It shows what people are like deep inside when they are brought up the cowboy way!  This is a fine example of Cowboy Spirit.  I would recommend it to any one any age.,1357430400,,190,3.9473684210526314

8556548,5,B00AQNQRDK,"Now I'll be upfront this is definitely a B-List movie with a small budget but it has a good story at the root with a man who didn't do what was considered acceptable but what was right. It has little to do with the actual sport of rodeo, but has to do with the fact that sometimes you do what is right even if others consider it wrong. A great movie for the whole family because there is a moral to the movie. Also has a few rodeo superstitions that most people wouldn't know.",1463529600,,476,4.074468085106383
