7824492,5,6302303583,I've got this movie and I don't know what the other reviewer was thinking to give this one star. The atmosphere and scenery in this movie are fantastic. It felt creepy and the concept of a succubus prowling the countryside is unique. The movie starts off with a witch being burned at the stake at an inquisition back in the dark ages and supposedly her evil survives to seduce and kill all the descendants of her original torturers. In the present she goes after the last of the descendants and seduces him and tries to make his wife go crazy. She finally takes her true form which is a demonic succubus and all hell breaks loose. This movie to me has a classic feel to it and I just wish it could be released on DVD or Blue ray.,1304294400,,729,4.251798561151079
