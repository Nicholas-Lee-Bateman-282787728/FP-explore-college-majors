8210230,5,B000009HGZ,"I taped this movie (under the name of ""Stoner"") from a UHF kung-fu theatre years ago, and it's a keeper. While George Lazenby does his best at the fighting scenes, it's Angela Mao and her fellow Hong Kong stunt players who steal the show. This is Angela at her technical best, and she does shine here. Highly recommended for her stuntwork; I give this flik 5 stars for it. She spins and kicks as well as any male star ever has, and in some ways better -- watch and you will see.",1171238400,,478,4.206521739130435
8210231,3,B000009HGZ,"A middle era picture starring the legendary Angela Mao.  The basic lpot line is about a Hong Kong policewoman (Angela Mao) sent by her superiors to infiltrate a drug ring manufacturing designer drugs.  The movie moves along at a decent clip, with several excellent fight scenes.  Angela is in fine form, but is underutilized.  The movies weakest link is the casting of one-time James Bond George Lazenby as a private eye also investigating the drug cartel.  His wooden acting and clunky fighting style detract greatly from the overall quality of the movie.  Like too many of Angela's movies, a male has been cast to support her when she is more than capable of carrying the movie herself.  Worth a look if only for Angela Mao, the world's first female action star of note.",987033600,,772,4.7593984962406015
