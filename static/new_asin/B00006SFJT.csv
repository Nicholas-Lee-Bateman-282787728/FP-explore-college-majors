1792409,5,B00006SFJT,"You wonder sometimes, if there are people who go through their entire lives without discovering the magic and transcendence of true love.  The two lovers in this movie, Andreas and Claire, provide a marvelous illustration of how profound and humbling it is to grow and nurture this feeling, creating a pair of true soul mates.  You are offered a glimpse of the many wonders and ramifications that must be endured when you are part of this type relationship - both young and old alike.
The movie is about a couple who, in their early adulthood, were passionate and caring lovers, but for some unexplained reason, were separated and married others with whom they established their own families.  The story takes place in the present, when Claire and Andreas are in their late 60's and in not-so-good health.  They are brought together and realize that they are still desirous of each other, emotionally and physically.  Andreas is widowed but Claire is married to a man, with whom she suddenly realizes, has not provided her love and fulfillment, but has provided material and financial support.
As background and transitional scenes of the movie flash back to 40 - 50 years previous in the lives of the two lovers - always without hearing their words, we are privy to all of the mundane and detailed complexities of day-to-day existence in the lives of the re-united, elder lovers as they face the truth of their realization that the bond that they forged in their youth has endured, and indeed, has grown.
Although the movie subtly depicts the emergence and resurgence of the elation in discovering and rediscovering romantic love, it sends a powerful and lasting message about the importance in being true to one's self.",1045526400,11,1721,4.900343642611684
1792410,5,B00006SFJT,"Two young people are shown kissing on the cover of the jewel case for this fine DVD. However, this story is decidely not about young love, but the genuine passion and mature love people nearing seventy can experience in their lives.
Anreas, played beautifully by Charles Tingwell, unexpectedly calls Claire, just as well performed by Julia Blake, after years spent apart in separate lives with their own respective families.  Adreas as a young man was an organist with an inportant future and his father discouraged his love for Claire.  The two young people had been intimate and were deeply in love when they were kept apart.  Even with more than thirty years separating them from their last meeting, they both remembered each other with love and affection.  When Andreas made the unexpected call to Claire, she agreed to meet him.
Not long after their first meeting they become lovers again in one of the most extraordinary stories we are likely to see at the movies.  These are mature, thoughtful people who understand what they are doing and confront the expected opposition they know they will receive.  They attempt to be open and honest with everyone about their relationship and most importantly, open and honest with themselves.
The story of Claire and Andreas is heartbreaking, particularly for Claire who spent much of her life in a conventional marriage which was comfortable, but not emotionally satisfying.  Andreas lost his own wife thirty years ago and now realizes how impoverished his life has been without his love for Claire. They both agree to live fully in the moment for as much time as they have left.
This brief summary covers the first third or so of the movie and prepares the viewer for the joys and sorrows this couple will face as they begin their new life together.
This film is quiet and thoughtful as it shows us the lives of two people we would like to know as they encounter one another after a long separation.  Claire and Andreas help us to think more deeply about our own lives and our relationship with the people who matter most to us. Few mature adults will fail to be moved by this heartfelt film.",1044576000,12,2140,4.764864864864865
1792411,4,B00006SFJT,"INNOCENCE is sonata about love - first love, interrupted love, lost love, rekindled love.  In a gentle manner the tale of a young couple falling in love is revealed in the opening sequences and then we meet that same couple decades later, after time, marriage to other people, family, and the world has smeared that tenuous prelude. The man learns his first love lives nearby, they meet, their love is renewed, and the woman must decide whether to follow her heart ( in her late sixties) or remain in a marriage without passion.  Simple story, the details are best left out as they might destroy the impact of this lovely film.  It is enough to say that the writer and director have presented a love story about people nearing seventy and have made that story as tender and erotic as if it were about youth.  The cycle of life, the consequences of choices, and the rare vision of the dignity of the beauty of aging are of more importance here.  In a time when the world population of Senior Citizens is rapidly expanding it is refreshing to come across a movie that makes aging not only OK, but actually a state to anticipate with a glow.",1042848000,14,1138,4.504854368932039
1792412,5,B00006SFJT,This movie grabbed my heart the first time and each time I've seen it.  The story of two college lovers reunited 50+ years later was played out in rotating flashbacks to current day. The techniques were artful and the emotional exchanges drew me completely into the story. It shows the power of love in our youth and in our aging.  It was utterly tender in it's representation of the cycle of life.,1042329600,,398,4.513888888888889
1792413,5,B00006SFJT,"What happens when you find a first love...and try to make it work the second time around? And what if you're no longer young or even middle-age but in your senior years? These questions forms the foundation for this lovely, whimsical move...and I absolutely loved watching it. Not only was it a nice change of pace to see lovers who remain passionate in spite of their obvious signs of age - receding hairlines, spreading waistlines, dimming vision - but to see them take such absolute delight in rediscovering each other again.
  In the years since they parted, both lovers have been married, had children and changed in many ways. So when they take up with each other, friends and family are alarmed and the couple themselves have to wonder if they can make it work - or even if they want to try after all these years. There is a lot at stake, a lot to risk. But underneath it all is a firm and abiding love, a love they may not find with anyone else. If you're as tired as I am of watching movies full of people barely out of adolescence, try this one on for size. Finally, a movie that really IS for Mature Audiences.",1039996800,3,1121,4.384615384615385
1792414,5,B00006SFJT,"What a deeply moving, beautiful movie. I enjoyed watching it so much.  It sheds light on the death that can occur through routine in relationships, and thus within people. It encourages and inspires us to look for life, no matter how old we are. . . and maybe even before it is so, or too, late.",1034985600,3,295,4.267857142857143
1792457,5,B00006SFJT,"This is one of the Paul Cox movies I missed when it was first released.  It was a beautiful story of unfulfilled love in wartime, with the couple being reunited in their seventies.  The main characters were played by much loved Aussie actors Charles (Bud) Tingwell and Julia Blake.  The husband of Julia's character was played by her partner in real life, Terry Norris, known to Australian audiences for his many roles in local TV drama series'.  These movies have not been available in Australia, so I was lucky enough to find it through the Amazon site, and have greatly enjoyed seeing such a sensitive and poignant story.",1374969600,,624,4.75
1792458,5,B00006SFJT,"I saw this movie on the cable a while ago and couldn't identify it. After a lot of searching I saw it on Amazon and ordered it immediately. It's a beautiful, touching movie about (everlasting?) love, enjoying life. Very recommended.",1354492800,,232,4.825
1792459,5,B00006SFJT,I purchased a video and received it in record time.  The quality and service were both top notch.  I will buy from this seller again.,1257033600,,133,4.28

1792461,5,B00006SFJT,"Claire & Andreas, young lovers reunited after 45 years, discover each kept a place in their heart for the other.

After the death of his much-beloved wife, Andreas writes to Claire, his first love. Claire at first declines his invitation to meet, but after years (20!) of a sexless marriage, thoughts of the desire she once felt for Andreas reawaken her sexuality, a part of her she thought had died. As youthful desire comes rushing back (aptly portrayed by flashbacks of tender moments) and preoccupy her thoughts, Claire is soon overwhelmed by the memory of his touch, his kiss, his flesh.

Resigned to a sexless marriage, Claire had never been unfaithful to her loving, but neglectful husband. Can she retain her ""Innocence"" and be content to live out her days tortured only by her thoughts and not by her deeds? Or, does she give in to temptation?

Thanks to Paul Cox for making this poignant film about the lasting impression first love makes on us all.",1233187200,,959,4.765060240963855
1792462,5,B00006SFJT,"If you come away from this movie with anything at all, let it be that statement - one of the last made by Claire, who has loved well, if perhaps not always too wisely. But yet, she followed her heart, and was true to herself. That is not an easy thing to do or to be. Especially once you've reached that certain age, when one is automatically supposed to be imbued with extra wisdom.

To love and be loved, to experience passion - even if only for a brief time - is the most wonderful thing in the world, and this movie brilliantly captures the essence of such a love. Liesurely, almost languid in the telling, Andreas and Claire were privileged to recapture their younger love, for a brief shining moment. We should all hope for as much. There is more to life than an unhappy marriage. Staying together to stay together when there is no love is deceitful and harmful to the participants.

This is a gorgeously executed film about love--at any age. I suppose it's true that younger people might lose patience with it anti-hectic approach, but they're the ones who should pay the most attention. Someday, it'll be their turn, and with any luck at all, they can experience what transpired between Claire and Andreas. This is indeed a love story for the ages. All of them.",1195257600,,1269,4.51304347826087
1792463,3,B00006SFJT,"If you are under the age of 50, you might pass this movie by. I think that the criticisms leveled by others regarding this film are generally deserved, I agree with most of them; however, as I am an aged, spavined, tattered and torn ex-Romeo myself, I gave it an extra star for its attempt at clarity. I really do think that you have to be older to appreciate what this movie - short on good writing and amateurishly acted by the lead male though it is - is about. It tends, at times, to be didactic, especially in some of the rather stilted conversations about God, but it does open to the screen an area of experience that is very close to the bone for those of us supposedly past our primes. Movies are always less and more than meets the eye, and this is no exception. For me this film, however weak in some areas it is, was touching and real. I was always aware of what it was lacking, but at the same time I was taken with its boldness in evaluating human love and sexuality in people over the age normally reserved for this kind of scrutiny. It's painfully lacking in humor (a huge and glaring deficit), and I think the writer and director took what they had to say much too seriously, but this ultimately does not detract from the truths it exposes. For all its faults, I do recommend it to those of us who have arrived at that moment when getting out of a chair has become a painful and tricky business.",1186876800,,1412,4.25278810408922
1792464,5,B00006SFJT,"This sweet, tender December/December romance executes its tricky premise with finesse and feeling, thanks to sensitive handling by director Paul Cox. Most poignant is the juxtaposition of the revived romance with images of Andreas and Claire's earlier passion, when their whole adult lives lay before them. Though Tingwell seems a bit rickety for Andreas, his performance still resonates, but Blake steals it as Claire, a woman facing unexpected joy- and pain- late in life.",1184889600,,474,5.418918918918919
1792465,3,B00006SFJT,"I had high hopes that this movie might be something special, but was disappointed.  First of all, the endless flashback scenes were a total waste, as the director could have shown the two young people making out once and we would have gotten the point.  I think the movie should have shown real scenes from their past; that is, show them talking, show us why they broke up.  Come on, Andreas never should have let Claire go when they were young.  But we get NO explanation for this, other than ""I listened to my father.""  How romantic is that?  You missed out on the chance for a great love of your life because of something your father said?  I respect the character less for it.  I did not like the casting of the males in this movie.  Andreas was simply too old and decrepit compared to Claire, who still seemed full of life.  And Claire's husband, similarly, seemed quite a bit too old for her.  We are given no explanation for why they have not made love in 20 years, or why he had not said ""I love you"" in 30 years.  And the son was completely not believable as a doctor.  And why was he so involved in their relationship?  Get a life, doc!  I liked the twist of having Claire die when the typical movie formula (played out to a tee with Andreas getting cancer) had Andreas dying first.  This movie could have been so much more interesting if they had really explored the relationship between Claire and Andreas, including why they had not worked out earlier.  And, they should have brought them together before they were about to die, so they would have had to work through the issues instead of just playing out their little time before death.  Disppointing!",1125273600,4,1666,4.442244224422442
1792466,5,B00006SFJT,"Innocence is about love. Young lovers who separate, marry others, then come together in old age and fall in love all over again, to the consternation of the husband of one of the pair. And it's beautiful, sad, funny, touching, heartbreaking, thoughtful - well, I can find no fault with it on any level. Beautiful acting, and you feel deeply for every single character.
The film occurs in the present as this charming elderly couple (in their 70s, we must assume) reunite and try to recast their previous love to conform to the truth they have just discovered: that the bond forged in their youth has only grown stronger with the passage of half a century. But to put the present into perspective, there are voiceless flashbacks to 50+ years in the past when they were young lovers - who, for some unexplained reason, chose to part and marry others.
See it. Please.",1059782400,9,864,4.65359477124183

7973022,5,B00006SFJT,"Any amazing film about love in mature years.  Julia Blake is radiant.  It seems so natural, almost documentary-like.  Very worth seeing by film lovers, but probably wouldn't appeal to the general market.",1426809600,,203,5.28125

7973024,5,B00006SFJT,"This is a wonderful film, released in 2000.  It tells the story of a rediscovered love between the two main characters, played superbly by Charles Tingwell and Julia Blake, with Terry Norris as Clare's horrified husband of 44 years.
A young and beautiful Marta Dusseldorp is warm and convincing as the daughter of the man, Andreas Borg, who receives the woman from his past with acceptance and friendship.  The relationship between father (Charles Tingwell's character) and his daughter, Monique, is open and affectionate, and a joy to watch.
I would recommend this film to anyone who loves Australian cinema, and it is a chance to see a group of Australian actors in fine form.",1414800000,,678,4.93859649122807

7973026,1,B00006SFJT,I bought this dvd because I could not rent it.  I read an article on Roger Ebert and his wife and what movies they both liked.  This movie was the one they loved to watch.  It was a very big disappointment.  I watched it with my sister and we felt we wasted our time watching it.  We kept waiting for something to engage us but it never happened.  The acting was terrible and the story never gave us the answer as to why they never married.  I don't recommended it to anyone.,1408492800,,475,4.0978260869565215

7973028,1,B00006SFJT,"Let's consider kittens for a moment.  Shall we all just stipulate that kittens are great (?)
Sure. But does that mean that any movie about kittens must also be great (?)  Of course not.

Likewise, let's stipulate that Love is for everyone -- not just young people.
Does that mean that any movie about old people in Love . . . must also be great (?) Of course not.

This movie has no point except (perhaps) this truism that Love is for everyone. And that's not nearly enough.

Especially as there's a lot of nonsense in the movie that's not related to that point whatsoever (or any other point of any kind):  surrealist dream sequences . . . bartender level philosophizing . . . disassociated nudity . . . dubious (or trivial) psychological motivation.",1405296000,,751,4.567164179104478
7973029,4,B00006SFJT,"I'd rather leave a lenghty review to those who write them better than I. One recommended review is Roger Ebert's which can be found online.

This film is a mature look at mature love, the power of memory and images, and the fact that old people can and do fall in love. With a lovely, simple musical score and a standout performance by Julia Blake, the film should appeal to open-minded, sensitive viewers who'd like to try a somewhat offbeat love story. Not for all tastes (although it was mine), so read a few reviews first and decide for yourself. If you're like me, you'll find this a little gem.",1379635200,,600,4.454545454545454
