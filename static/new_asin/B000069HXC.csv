1733360,5,B000069HXC,"The high quality footage of the blue planet is a joy to behold, theres some jaw dropping sequences, and the hard work and dedication which has gone into making this feature drips through from every frame.
there are faults, the sound effects are sometimes too obvious, and the fact that they stand out, obviously means they got them wrong, and the sound is nice, but  is too overawing on occasion, the footage should have been allowed to take priority throughout, to cheapen it with silly sound effects is a real shame.
also there is way too much repitition of sequences, which again is a shame, with the vast ammount of footage they must have captured why do we hark back to the feeding  frenzy baitball in almost every episode.
luckily the quality of the filming is such that all can be forgiven.
the extra features are a bit patchy, a couple of the interviews are mildly watchable and the making off feature is excellent, but would have liked to have seen much more of this and possibly some extra footage, the making off was excellent though, and definately one of the highlights of the whole series. the other extra features are pure filler though.
amazing and informative, the BBC has carried off a massively ambitious project very successfully.",1032739200,13,1250,4.729357798165138
1733361,3,B000069HXC,"The information and narration in this set is excellent, as always for an Attenborough project. However, the presentation is badly flawed by excessive use of incredibly annoying sound effects. We are continually bombarded with swoops, honks, cunches, explosions, bleeps, whistles, and every other kind of sound imaginable. It is unnecessary and distracting. This DVD set should really have an option to turn off the stupid noises.
Also, although the material is wonderful, there is a lot of repetition. There were several near-identical sequences of predators attacking a shoal of fish, and we lost count of the number of times we heard the phrases ""rich nutrient soup"" and ""feeding frenzy"".
Still, there's nothing to compare to an Attenborough series. I just wish I could give this one the five stars it deserves.",1032134400,26,813,5.213740458015267
1733362,5,B000069HXC,"It has been no surprise that the naturalist Sir David Attenborough and the authoritative BBC have produced such an excellent documentary about the undersea nature. The first one has already shown his competence in previous documentaries such as ""The Living Planet"", ""Trials of Life"", ""Life of Birds"" and ""The Private Life of Plants"". He is able to provide scientific information as if you are listening to a captivating story. The BBC is also responsible for high quality and famous documentaries such as ""The Human Body"", ""The Planets"" and ""Walking with Dinossaurs"". The images of never-seen-before creatures provided by the Blue Planet are scientifically valuables but they also can be enjoyed through a cinematographic point of view: there are beautiful and breathtaking shots. This DVD will surely be a precious addition to your DVD collection.",1030579200,3,848,5.335820895522388
1733363,4,B000069HXC,"I just received my copy of the collector's set today, so this review is just based on my impressions after having seen the first two episodes (Part 1).
Maybe I'm biased from having grown up watching documentaries with him as narrator, but David Attenborough has to be the best narrator I've heard (with Avery Brooks coming in a close second).  He does an excellent job in this series, and if you watch the ""Making of"" videos included on the discs you will even get to see him as he appears in the ""Making Of"" extras and is responsible for the narration in them as well.  My only complaint related to the audio is that the narration is often separated by loud, overdramatic music.  At times the score overlaps the narration and is sometimes loud enough that it is difficult to hear the Attenborough's voice.  Also, the mix is slightly off and I often found myself turning the volume down during the dramatic music and back up when the narration continued.  It did seem to get better as I got further into the disc, which may have been because I was so enthralled with the visuals...
...which have to be some of the best I've ever seen.  The DVDs were excellently produced and are filled with the most vivid colors and sharpest images which are very comparable to those seen in the movie Baraka, which I also highly recommend.  The excellent cinematography is evident throughout both episodes I have watched so far, although I did notice a speck or two of dirt on the waterproof camera casing in a few shots.  There were also a few less saturated shots that didn't fit in as well with the rest of the footage.  However,  those are *very* minor flaws that will probably go unnoticed by the majority of viewers (I had to start looking for them to notice them at all).
The first disc contains two ""Making Of"" videos which describe some of the issues that the film teams had in filming the subjects in the first two episodes.  I found these to be highly entertaining, and well produced.  As I mention above, Attenborough does the narration for these videos as well.  The only problem I had with the ""Making of"" videos was that I wanted them to be much longer.
The only 'gripe' I have with the DVDs (and the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5) would be the overall flow of the shows.  They seem to jump from scene to scene with little to connect them.  The overly dramatic music added to the feeling that I was being jerked around from animal to animal.  Just as I would begin to be enthralled by the scene before my eyes, the score would rise to a crescendo and I was pulled on to the next scene.  It's very similar to the start-stop feeling I had while being pulled from scene to scene in the recent Lord of the Rings DVD.
If you couldn't already tell, I don't hesitate to recommend these DVDs very highly.",1030579200,11,2803,4.432748538011696
1733364,4,B000069HXC,"Although not quite the ""complete natural history of our oceans"" the series claims to, there can be little doubt that the Blue Planet series is one of the finest documentaries on the subject ever made.
The visuals are a treat to behold, from speeding tuna and sharks to pulsating jellyfish.  Users of higher quality tv sets (especially HD sets) should put this at the top of their lists for reference quality video.  In particular, shots of glowing jellyfish from ""The Deep"" showcase the capabilites of high quality sets.
The sound is also quite good, although purists will note that sound effects have been added to increase dramatic effect.  Whether you listen in stereo or in pro logic surround, the soundmix is always serviceable (although a true 5.1 mix would have ben nice).
The series is certainly informative, but lets face facts.  Most people who purchase this disk will do it for the eye candy, and will NOT be disappointed.  Highly reccomended.",1028160000,6,954,4.900621118012422

1733863,3,B000069HXC,"I bought this series to use with my marine biology class and while it is helpful, some of the videos I thought were too violent to show to high school students; for instance, Coasts was scene after scene of predator-prey interactions and some were very disturbing and went on for too long a period of time to make the point. Some of the videography is dated, using older types of computer graphics to illustrate the concept. But there is good information in the series, just preview them before showing to a class or younger children. Many of these series are also available on You Tube for a pay-per-view price.",1451088000,3,612,4.623853211009174
1733864,5,B000069HXC,"An excellent and well made film.  The parts on Antarctica are so beautiful and well done it stood so well. I liked the part on the Amazon as well. It made me want to be a deep sea diver. What an amazing adventure it would be to have a job like that.  This may seem strange but this film made me conclude that the arguments of vegetarians are absurd. The reason for that is that this film shows so much eating habits of various species. In other words, it depicts seals as eating penguins who are in turn eaten by killer whales who also eat grey whales. Tuna eat anchovies who are in turn eaten by sharks. Birds eat sea turtles. And hawks eat lizards. If most nature species feed on others, why should humans be an exception? I don't know if that makes sense, but this concept entered my head.",1450656000,3,792,4.23841059602649

The only TV I watch now is pretty much this kind - the educational and discovery ( nova, history channel,  etc) and anything Marvel. The narrator was excellent and visually it was stunning. Not to mention some of the best education on about sea life ever. Absolutely beautiful.  Happy it was a series to enjoy.  The best episode was Frozen Seas. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

1733956,5,B000069HXC,"Hard not to love this, despite a very irritating flaw in the deep sea episode.  I suppose that episode would have been mostly silent without sound effects.  When the angler fish closed it's mouth on its prey, there was a sound something like a slamming iron door with echoes.  There was a lot of that kind of thing in that episode.  And there were probably added sound effects in the other episodes, as there seemed to be exaggerated sounds when some predators attacked, and there are noisy jellyfish.  I suppose many nature documentaries add sound later, because the microphones may be from too far away.  But it shouldn't be this obvious.",1436659200,,640,4.7207207207207205

It's almost like the BBC nature team was working on its bachelor's degree during ""The BLUE Planet"" in 2001, it's masters degree during ""Planet Earth"" in 2006, and it's PhD with ""LIFE"" in 2009.

Don't get me wrong, The BLUE Planet has LOTS of top notch footage, but it is not on par with more recent BBC One releases.

If you have already watched Planet Earth or LIFE you will see what I mean when you compare BLUE Planet to them.

1734138,5,B000069HXC,"The BBC has proven time and again that they are of the highest caliber in the world in the creation of nature documentaries, especially when the program is accompanied by the narration of the legendary conservationist David Attenborough. Fantastic series from The Life of Birds in the 90s to the more recent Life and Frozen Planet show their exceptional consistency over time. Of course Planet Earth is legendary. But I think my personal favorite is The Blue Planet which concerns the life in and around the worlds oceans that covers over two-thirds of the Earths surface.

  The series has eight parts, and while everyone is bound to have their favoritesmine are Coral Seas and Frozen Seasall eight are informative, fascinating, with wonderful cinematography, engaging music, and near perfect commentary. I can give no complaint about the fabulous pacing which never seems to focus on anything for too long or not long enough. From sharks in a wild feeding frenzy, to penguins shooting out of the water onto an iceberg, to majestic whales and dolphins, to some of the strangest creatures you will ever see in the ocean deep, there is something here for everyone regardless if you're a big nature lover or not. Narrator Attenborough is second to none in expelling information with an authentic passion for the life on screen.

  Ive gone through this series beginning-to-end twice, and have seen individual episodes more than that. It may not have the ultra-high definition of later BBC Nature series, but its every bit as wondrous and impacting as any made before or since that I have seen. It holds up well and is a must see for people who care about ocean ecosystems and for those who just admire the beauty of this blue planet of ours.",1419724800,,1739,4.858108108108108

My favourite episode has to be the coral seas. David Attenborough's voice is so pleasant, they actually have footage of super shrimp that live inside of a sea sponge, and the focus is spread around to so many organisms, not just a few, and somehow still remains tight. Blue Planet is great at giving lots of information without seeming all over the place and supplies amazing visuals with the information every time.

1734456,2,B000069HXC,"Awsome series.  Unfortunately the picture quality in bluray version is awful.  Underwater/sunset/darker scenes look very grainy.

I have seen this program on both DVD and Bluray.  I would stick with DVD version.

I gave two stars because of the quality issue in bluray.",1398643200,,269,5.162790697674419

1734490,4,B000069HXC,"The info/content of the Seas of Life is GREAT!  My wife loves it...but the quality of the picture is lacking.  Putting a low quality product on a bluray disc does not make it bluray quality.  We can really see the difference...when you watch the previews on this bluray, the quality is AWESOME...then the Seas of Life program begins and I would say you lose at 20% of the clarity or more.  BUT...if you look (as of 15 April 2014), the Bluray set is CHEAPER than the DVD set by about $9 so I would still opt for the bluray set.",1397520000,4,526,4.23

1734496,5,B000069HXC,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series but I have only one issue.  I had an old series but it did not have subtitles.  I repurchased this item because it mentioned the extra dvd and SUBTITLES.  I have yet to find the subtitles.  Therefore, a little disappointing because I don't want to miss one word in the dialogue and having a hearing challenge, I often do.  Otherwise, this is such an exceptional production that I never tire of watching it. Thank  you BBC.",1395964800,4,464,4.597560975609756

1734512,4,B000069HXC,"If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would.  It's yet another excellent BBC nature program made less than perfect by the sometimes distracting sound effects.  I'd much rather enjoy just the natural sounds, soundtrack, and the superb narration.",1394064000,,240,5.128205128205129

1734557,5,B000069HXC,"I watched all episodes and they fascinated me.  There are many scientific studies performed involving the resources of the seas - from the surroundings as well as what the fish actually produce biologically.  Some examples were shared.  No doubt it is reflective of a yin-yang concept - that if something harmful occurs, a solution can also occur.  Answers are out there; we just have to find them.  To see the floor of the seas, including this large gap that was about 24,000 miles long - I believe that is how long it was (an amazing length in the ocean) just reminds me the complexity and diversity of the world and though man has conquered many things, man will never be able to conquer nature itself.

Although a few scenes in the first one we're the best for out young ones, overall it is a VERY toddler friendly series, which isn't easy for this type of production.

Sound was great, and visual experience was amazing. There was a comic glitch.  I watched the video for a bit late one evening and stopped in the middle to finish it another day.  When I opened it again the video sound continued where I'd left off but the captions were for an NCIS show.  It was whacky.  But the sound and video were fine. I hope this is a temporary glitch.",1390953600,,521,4.078431372549019

1734578,2,B000069HXC,I bought this bluray series because I love the planet earth series. I thought the reviews average was pretty good and almost comparable to the planet earth bluray series but this turned out to be a disappointing purchase because the quality is no where near Bluray quality.

1734597,5,B000069HXC,My wife and I had watched this on animal planet a couple of years ago.  We found it very fascinating to see things that we have experienced before and thought it was a well done documentary.  We saw this on Amazon and thought it might be good material for our 3 year old son.  Although some scenes of animals hunting are a little graphic we have explained that they are trying to eat to live.  He absolutely loves this show and watching all these amazing creatures that he has not learned about up to this point.  We like to have him watch educational material over cartoons and this one has really captured his attention and imagination.,1389139200,,638,4.4655172413793105

1734616,5,B000069HXC,"Even today, more than ten years after it was first broadcast, Blue Planet remains unsurpassed as a pioneering exploration of the seas and oceans of planet Earth. Like most popular nature series, it is light on science, but makes up for it with amazing photography. Years in the making, the BBC dedicated huge amounts of time, $$, and people to make it happen. The result is unique, showing many new species for the first time, and delivering amazing close-ups of underwater biota from thermal vents to coral reefs.

However, I was kinda disappointed by the poor picture quality.  Unlike Plant Earth, this series wasn't naturally 1080p as it claimed to be.  That's probably why the blu-ray version came out so late.",1386201600,2,341,4.827586206896552

1734642,5,B000069HXC,The Blue Planet series is both visually appealing and educational. I have used it with my high school science classes and it is one of my 4 year-old's favorite shows.,1383004800,,166,4.566666666666666

1734655,1,B000069HXC,"My Star Count is ONLY for the Blu-Ray itself.  The Content is a FULL 5 STAR!!!

I've purchased two of these from Amazon.  Both copies have audio problems that, ironically, sound like its under water.  At first I thought it was some ""Special Effect"" that made the Music sound Watery, but Attenborough's voice wavers and bubbles too. Once you notice it, it is very annoying.

I returned the first Disc assuming it was a defective disc.  The second one was the same and since I couldn't find any reviews that talked about what I was experiencing, I assumed it might be a problem with my PS3.  I just returned my second copy from Amazon, and now Amazon is posting that its not selling the disc any more because of ""problems.""  Amazon doesn't say what those ""problems"" are, but I assume its the same problem I'm having.

I compared it to my DVD copy and the DVD sounds perfect.

Just FYI:  The Video is only ever-so slightly better than the DVD version and the Audio, besides the aforementioned problems, sounds distorted and muddy.  I bought this because it takes up less space on my shelves, assuming it was at the very least, a bit better than the DVD.  Not so much.",1380844800,10,1164,4.485714285714286

1734658,4,B000069HXC,"Although it claims 5.1, there is no bass from my subwoofer. Except perhaps the first couple of seconds of title video, the bass disappears as soon as the main feature begins.

I think they should make the correction to avoid misleading consumers.

As many have mentioned, the video quality is subpar, definitely way below the golden standard of ""planet earth"" series.

My favorite scenes are:
The deep sea abyss, I'm out of words to describe those amazing creatures.
The detailed description of coral reefs's life cycles, I have seen plenty of coral reef video, but never at this level of detail.
The Killer whale's skilled strategies in exhausting and rolling the baby humpback whale, and to ""drown"" it, is fascinating.",1380067200,6,720,4.983333333333333

Incredible what's under the surface of our seas and you can't help but wonder how in the heck they were there to film this stuff.  I squeeze into my wetsuit and put my scuba gear on to watch this - hard to get to the fridge with the fins on though.  Makes a great gift for mom or dad.,1378684800,,358,3.810810810810811

While the content of The Blue Planet is up the the usual standard, the final quality of the Blu-ray version is really quite bad.  The video quality is watchable, but the sound is distorted and distracting.  I have not seen the DVD version to compare it, but I would recommend steering clear of the Blu-ray conversion.

The videos offer a quite comprehensive view of the deep sea which we really don't know much about, with a clear exhibition of both macroscope scenes and microscope structures. The one about coral seas is extremely cool. The narrator is good and easy to follow. I'd say it's both educational and entertaining, and suitable for all ages.",1377216000,2,449,5.081081081081081

1734824,2,B000069HXC,"This review is of ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" Blu-Ray 3-Disc set.

The show itself gets five stars. ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" was put together before the amazing ""Planet Earth"". The series explores the world's oceans in a manner that provides viewers astounding footage of underwater marine life. It is an amazing production, and runs 389 minutes with the option of English subtitles for the hearing-impaired.
Disc One contains the following:
Ocean World
The Deep
Open Ocean
Frozen Seas
Making Of
Disc Two contains the following:
Seasonal Seas
Coral Seas
Tidal Seas
Coasts
Disc Three
Interviews with producer Alastair Fothergill, cameraman Doug Allan, and researcher Penny Allen
Five Bonus Programs: Amazon Abyss, Dive to Shark Volcano, Between the Tides, Antarctica, Deep Trouble

As for audio and picture quality, the Blu-Ray discs do not do this production justice. The audio quality veers between clear sound to a high-pitched mechanical type sound quality with a kind of echo after each voice-over. It is very annoying and almost made me want to turn the sound off. The picture quality is below average compared to other BBC Blu-Ray editions such as Planet Earth etc. I hope the manufacturers correct this defect before re-issuing another edition.",1367366400,3,1262,5.181372549019608
1734825,3,B000069HXC,The sound and image quality of these blu-rays was very poor.  Far below the standards I have come to expect from a BBC produced show.  The show itself is excellent.  But I recommend you buy the DVD version - the quality of the blu-ray edition is not worth the extra cost.,1367280000,3,271,4.2745098039215685
1734826,2,B000069HXC,"There is a sound issue with the pitch on this blu ray and potentially a bad batch that was released. David Attenborough sounds super high pitched to the point where the sound is literally cutting out for a milasecond all throughout the program. I found this problem to be evident on all discs and returned my copy. The picture quality is also severely lacking as was mentioned by many others. This should have been given the proper treatment it deserved or if that was ""impossible"" just leave it as a DVD release. We are all spoiled by the great super high definition BBC releases and this sadly falls waaaaaaay short of the epic Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Life, or the newly released Africa.",1367280000,3,694,4.650406504065041

Notwithstanding that this is an upconvert from standard definition to high def., I had higher hopes that the BBC engineers would have made a better rendition commensurate with their renowned standards of quality.

Not only does video quality vary at times, but I was aware of an annoying flutter with the music soundtrack.

On balance, I can only recommend this set with the above mentioned caveats. Otherwise, buy the SD DVD version and save some money.",1366502400,4,711,5.008474576271187

1734856,2,B000069HXC,"I have the ""Planet Earth"" Blu-ray set and the quality of the images is impressive. I recall that when Blu-ray first came out all the electronics stores used this series to demonstrate their monitors and I was hoping for similar quality here.

The ""Blue Planet"" Blu-rays just aren't of this technical calibre. The image quality ranges from okay to poor, often with jagged edges on swimming fish and ""halos"" around them (I imagine from sharpening artefacts) and washed out colours (and paradoxically, gaudy cartoonish colours). Even the best ""Blue Planet"" sequences can't match the average (or even poorer) quality ""Planet Earth"" sequences.

I can't see any reason to replace the DVDs (which I also own) with the Blu-rays and regret doing so, especially since I bought a second set for my daughter. We watched it together in dismay. She said it reminded her of watching ""Magnum PI"". I didn't ask for enlightenment, but she wasn't being complimentary.

They don't appear to be HD at all. I have hundreds of Blu-ray discs and, while I haven't watched them all yet, this set is the poorest quality I have seen. If this is the best that the BBC could do with the source material that they had, they shouldn't have issued it on Blu-ray.

1734858,3,B000069HXC,"George Fenton's terrific score anchors this spectacular BBC documentary from the same creative team that would later produce ""Planet Earth,"" including host David Attenborough and producer Alastair Fothergill. BBC's 1080p transfer of their acclaimed 2001 ""Blue Planet"" mini-series still offers breathtaking footage of life under and just above the surface, from dolphins and killer whales to seal pups and baby turtles - the latter groups fighting to stay away from predators.

However, because the BBC's Blu-Ray presentation has been mastered from a standard-definition source (and is clearly stated as such on the back cover, albeit in tiny print), the upscaled presentation varies greatly from certain sequences that nearly look HD in quality (the film based portions), to others that are clearly derived off video elements and display jaggies and other issues (i.e. much of the underwater footage). Either way, none of the transfer is actually presented in high-def -- so consumers will have to determine for themselves whether this upscale is enough of an upgrade over the prior DVD release to justify the purchase (I don't have the DVD to compare it with). Five bonus programs, interviews with Fothergill and other crew members, 80 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage and DTS MA 5.1 soundtracks round out the release.

ADDITIONAL NOTES - There seems to be a misconception that BLUE PLANET was entirely filmed on 16mm film stock. I refer readers to this 2002 in-depth article on the production of BLUE PLANET and its HD mastering, which includes interviews with the producers and presents evidence to the contrary:

[...]

It clearly states ""the source material varied from a wide range of film and video formats,"" says that ""a significant percentage of the original material was shot on video,"" and goes onto state ""having so much video footage interspersed with the film footage was a change that presented a particular challenge in providing a seamless transfer to HD.""

So not all of it was shot on film stock. Underwater portions, which I mentioned were derived from a video source, is also confirmed in this article: ""however, for many of the underwater sequences it was important to give a sense of speed, so video running at 50i was more appropriate. Shooting video underwater is also easier because the cameras are smaller, and you can spend more time filming before you have to change rolls"". There are jaggies and other problems all throughout this transfer IN those moments that are derived not from 16mm but video sources -- clearly upconversion artifacts.

Perhaps it was too daunting a task for them to track down every last bit of footage and remaster it for HD. The author of the article even asks the BBC rep why the whole production ""wasn't shot in HD to begin with,"" which implies that not every scrap of footage was either shot on film or an HD-based video format. Keep in mind this production was filmed in the late '90s when it was not cost-prohibitive for crews to all be carrying HD cameras around (which is also stated in the article).

Either way, the fact is that this transfer -- all of it, including the film based portions -- is a standard-def upconvert, and is confirmed as such on the packaging itself.",1365033600,194,3240,4.988888888888889

The highlites of this series are plenty: the polar bear hunting a group of beluga whales which are trapped around a breathing hole in the ice; the aforementioned deep sea organisms; time lapse footage of tidal changes; a large marine snail eating a small one, with hermit crabs waiting for the empty shell nearby; orcas separating a gray whale calf from its mother, before killing it; and many more.

And, well, for this puppy, unfortunately the Blu-Ray distribution rights are exclusive to the Discovery Channel, so you won't find it listed on Amazon until the exclusive rights have expired.  At any rate, you may find the Blu-Ray for the ""Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" title right here: [...] and if that link dies, just go to: [...] EDIT: Whoops, I forgot that Amazon kills external links, for good reason.

I always like to share good things. Also, do yourself a favor, Discovery Channel always has a bunch of promo codes out there for their store, do a Google search and save yourself 25%. You can get this well under $30.00 and sometimes with free shipping.

You're welcome.

EDIT: Okay, a couple things I want to mention now that I've finished watching this series. Review time...

The set comes on two disks.  The first disk is all Attenborough--a God for those of us nature movie lovers. The second disk is narrated by Pierce Brosnan, who actually doesn't suck.  I mean, I feel like I'm having an affair when I say that, as if I'm disgracing Sir Attenborough, but seriously, Brosnan has a great voice for nature narration. Thing is, if you Google reviews on this series you'll learn quickly why this Blu-Ray is hard to find, I mean, aside from the licensing issue mentioned above.  The production quality isn't the worlds greatest. There are some reviews out there unnecessarily scathing because this feature doesn't have the constant eye-popping caliber of Life or Planet Earth, BUT--and I mean this honestly as a collector of nearly fifty nature Blu-Rays--don't be too dissuaded by those overreactions. The quality isn't as polished as Life or Planet Earth, but it's certainly better than DVD quality.  Yet far beyond that, this documentary series is REALLY fascinating. There aren't very many comprehensive documentary studies on the ocean that cover so many facets of biological science. And with that consideration, this series is of high caliber.  No seriously, the depth of coverage is mind-boggling. The deep ocean, particularly exploring the mid-ocean ridges (miles under the ocean surface) is mind blowingly sensational. It really gives you an idea of how much of the planet we have left to explore.  One aside, and I say this hoping that BBC Earth and Discovery Channel read this review, the only thing I HATE (and hate is the appropriate word) about this feature is one of the marine biologist experts; this dude is WAY too enthusiastic and comes off ridiculous and unprofessional (this is the dude in the salmon colored shirt with the long hair). He talks to the viewer as if we are all twelve. Guy should never be permitted to be in front of a rolling camera, he's so effen' annoying.

One final thing I want to say in defense of the set, it offers a lot of replayability.  Although there isn't a lot of sweeping aerial footage showing off the ocean (as in that MAGNIFICENT and NEARLY FLAWLESS ""Wild Pacific"") this film is more scientifically centered, a breath of fresh air, in my opinion. You get a fantastic dose of edification from this series. It's, I would say, equivalent to going to the Monterrey Bay Aquarium and reading every exhibit. So for that, it's superb in learning character.  This is why I recommend this feature.

DISCLAIMER: If this is your first-time nature movie purchase, I insist on steering you to BBC's ""Wild Pacific,"" ""Galapagos,"" ""Yellowstone,"" or ""Ganges."" Those are the true entrances into this fascinating and totally-worthy-of-your-time nature movie obsession.",1328745600,12,3742,4.915873015873016

1734988,1,B000069HXC,"I purchased this from the Discovery Channel Store when it was on sale. I am shocked at the horrible image quality. It's nowhere near blu-ray quality, and looks quite inferior to ALL of my blu-ray discs. (I have a few hundred) I spoke with a supervisor at TDCS about my complaint. She said the only thing I could do was to write a review to be posted on their website. I did, and mentioned several other negative reviews, where the chief complaint was the poor image quality. I checked back a while later on their website, and all the negative reviews EXCEPT mine were deleted. I decided to post a second review, and mentioned it probably wouldn't be there long. I was right. It was deleted, as my original review is STILL posted on their website. They think they can make me out to be as dishonest as they are, but they never will. If others post negative reviews on their website, they will probably get deleted as well. I encourage others to post honest reviews here on Amazon, so TDCS will start to take our complaints seriously. I could not ethically try to sell my like-new ""blu-ray"" set, because it simply isn't one. I will be extremely cautious before I even CONSIDER purchasing another Discovery Channel release in the future. If there are ANY complaints about poor image quality, I will pass. I will also wait for a significant number of reviews to be posted as well, like here on Amazon, and not at TDCS.

I started watching this on TV on Animal Planet. I used to stay up late watching it bugging my parents out, but it made me love science in a whole new way. I just couldn't get enough, and I hadn't seen everything, that i just had to get the episodes myself.

The Frozen Waters part won't even show the video and the only thing that happens is broken audio. There is not even a scratch on the disc. I would return it but I am stationed overseas in the military. I was really looking forward to watching these, to help pass the time. Now I am just left disappointed.

1735016,3,B000069HXC,"I am an admirer of Sir David Attenborough and his nature documentaries beginning many years back with ""Life on Earth"" which certainly in my opinion, remains his best.  I have bought everything that he has done and none equals it.  However, this series is a good series but I was disappointed because I was hoping to see more of the mysterious ""deep, dark ocean depths. There is one segment on this on one disc. While it is well-done, it is not nearly enough. As he says, this is an area barely explored Yes! , so please explore it some more!.

Another point: I have as I expect have most people, seen thousands of pictures of fish and sharks in my life. Not so interesting by now. I wanted to see less of what is familiar to us and more of the Kafkaesque appearance and behavior of the mysterious creatures of the deep. There are some equisitely beautiful creatures in the oceans not to mention many  which have yet to be discovered.

Yet, instead of presenting the more bizaare aspects of life in the seas, we see endless shots of sharks and tuna and dolphins and whales. Haven't we all seen a lot of these already? I love dolphins and whales , while I loathe sharks. But I've seen enough of them. On disc two for example, we're shown a shark chasing and driving to the surface a school of fish, most often tuna - seven or eight times . Enough already!!!
Also, my complaint about this is that it might as well have been shot in black and white for all the color we see.  The photo's of predators chasing prey as mentioned above are all in shades of blue, really boring. I would have preferred to see more of the unequalled color of the Coral Reefs, yet only one segment is devoted to them

Also, some of each disc profiles sea birds and polar bears,and seals which should have been included on the ""Life of Birds"" and ""Life of Mammals"" sets respectively. On a series about the ocean, I want to be underwater all the time!

But as I've mentioned when we were taken underwater, too much of it was colorless and near the surface and not enough in the spooky, fascinating depths where the most unbelievable creatures hold court. ( I know this from having seen their likes profiled elsewhere before.)

But overall, it is a nice set and I can recommend it even though it didn't meet my hopes and expectations as outlined above.",1321833600,4,2322,4.4192037470726

1735020,5,B000069HXC,"If you lack attention span and only want to look at pretty images and don't care about anything about the actually ecology than yeah watch Planet Earth, since its the most dumped down documentary ever made. (Sorry if I just offended you.) I wouldn't say The Blue Planet series is perfect since it covers so much species so Attenborough can't go into much details about each individual species. However, the delivery style is much better than Planet Earth, it retains a good balance between interesting information and doesn't try hard to bombard viewers with cheesy, grandiose shots and time lapses,

My only dislike is this series also suffered from bad transitioning, like Planet Earth, one scene jumped to the next without correlation. However, it generally has good pace and should be much more interesting to watch, it has a calmer delivery style.

I could be wrong, but a few scenes from this documentary is rehash in Planet Earth. It would be nice if BBC re-release this series in HD.",1312848000,,991,4.8579881656804735

Often at the end of each episode, grouped thematically by ecosystem, you get a glimpse in the short segment known as 'diaries' where they show the cameramen and producers trying to get the shot, in the air, underwater, or on the shore. From the same group that brought us the amazing BBC series 'Planet Earth'.

While the points in the narration are valid and factual, there seems to be a lacking morally-attributable fiber.  In other words, it seemed there was, in the depth of the obviously-advanced technology used for capturing the footage, a humanistic hopelessness devoid of God.  The pervasiveness of New World Order(ness) permeated the astute observations of the BBC-compiled crew.  Perhaps the policy of world Christianity has finally manifested itself in clear and unmistakably atheistic lines.  It's as if she has almost dared anyone to come against her lamb-veneered, beastly core, waiting to catch the spirit of Protest of the true Christian hope in rapture.

The beauty of the world is worshiped in this production, but the God who created her is left in the wake of 2000+ yrs. of ecclesiastical, church-state fornicated apostasy.",1298505600,6,1065,5.121387283236994

My kids loved watching this because this shows you things that you couldn't see any other way anywhere else! there's ocean world, frozen seas, coasts, seasonal seas,the deep,coral seas, open ocean, tidal seas and then there is extra footage of the crew diving into the murky amazon (abyss)river,antarctica, between the tides,and dive into shark volcano which is in the ocean around cocos island so in other words this is amazing, the narration is great and actually gives you a good explanation of what you are seeing and how, why it is where and what it is and how it became the way it is and it will NOT at all bore you! I have twin girls that are 10 yrs old and they don't like a lot of the nature shows I watch but they and I were very impressed at how well it kept them entertained.

1735065,4,B000069HXC,"This documentary shows many parts of the seas in spectacular scenes, which we can hardly expect to see in other documentaries. Yes, they are really wonderful. It is composed of 10 episode, each of which shows the beauty of one part of the seas. The producers of the Blue Planet put us just in front of where the creatures live.

But it only shows. Though it shows awesome pictures, I expected more. For example, they show plankton, but does not explain about it anymore.  They one show them. They show a sei whale, but just in a short time. We can learn nothing more than how it looks and it eats sardines. Sometimes they explain, but they concentrate on showing scenes.  I think that about 400 minutes is enough time to be more educating, keeping showing, too.

I'm not saying this documentary is not good enough. It is wonderful. But it's not perfect and it could be better.",1276128000,5,876,4.525316455696203
1735066,2,B000069HXC,"A beautifully filmed documentary of ocean life.  However, viewer beware: the series overemphasizes the reality of the often brutal food chain that supports ocean life, which can be unpleasant for adults and children alike.  Drawn out attack and feeding frenzy scenes outweigh the otherwise interesting narrative about the many amazing species above and below the ocean. Discs 3-5 provide the best attention to the amazing variety of sea life, so rent those discs if you prefer a spectacular view into the underwater world.  Later discs delve into the religious and political with discussions of dinosaurs and global warming.  If you're looking for a spectacular peek into the underwater world, I'd more readily recommend the video, IMAX: The Living Sea.

Can't escape the feeling the writers / producer(s) take a bit of artistic license, with all the quirky sound effects, computer graphics and other things. In defense, though, it's difficult to give a good visual portayal of what the Mariana Trench is about (deepest part is over 36,000 ft deep...).

Biggest minus (for me) is the absence of subtitles. The rest of the household thinks this stuff is 'too boring', so most of the time I end up watching this instead of the late-night shows. Always trying to keep the volume down not to bother other people, which is easy when you can switch on the subtitles.

Each episode is about 45mins in length (no commercials! yaay!) and each DVD contains a couple of extras (behind the screens, photos, that sort of things). Haven't viewed these yet, so can't comment on the value.

If you haven't seen any episodes of Blue Planet or Planet Earth, try renting or otherwise taking a peak at one of the episodes; if you like one, then you'll love the rest of them.  I purchased the entire collection of Planet Earth and Blue Planet after watching a couple of episodes.

If you are interested in ocean animals, biology, or just like learning about new things in a fun way, this is for you.  I personally really love marine life, so this was right up my alley.  Each show is about 45 min. long and there are a couple of shows on each disk.

Every ""episode"" is just amazing and blows me away.  Even though I have read many books on the subject, there is so much to know.  The cinematography is great, it seems like the viewer is just swimming along and ""happens"" to run into whatever animal they are talking about, rather than the painstaking process I'm sure it took to find each one.  You are shown many different types of animals from different areas of the ocean.

This series came before ""Planet Earth"" and focused on the world's oceans and the life that inhabits it and its shores. The video quality is quite good - it's just that I have become used to HD and therefore I find myself wishing this was available in that format.  I suspect the film stock is not up to HD quality which is why it is not offered on Blu-Ray.
If you enjoy nature and in particular the oceans then I would recommend this series.

1/19/2011 - I just wanted to point out that ""Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" came out on TV before HD became popular. I have seen some of the comments that this series is now out on Blu-Ray - but the video quality is quite poor as compared to other Blu-Ray disks. This goes back to my first comments - The quality from the original film/video is just not good enough for high def.

There is never a dull moment because there is always something new to look at.

The films have incredible scope and vision. For example, ""seasonal seas"" explains the cycle of the oceans and shows life from the microscopic level up to sharks, seals, dolphins and whales.

1735152,5,B000069HXC,"Produced by the same people who brought us the amazing Planet Earth, we're given the no less amazing Blue Planet.

Where Planet Earth gave us the world, Blue Planet focuses entirely on the oceans and all the life that depend on it. What we're given here is a true masterpiece in photography and cinematography that'll blow away your senses and amaze you. No one has ever captured ocean life like this before.

This set is comprised of 4 discs, with each disc consisting of 2 areas or conditions in which sea life flourish. From the coasts and tides to the deep and the arctic, just about every area of the ocean known to man is beautifully captured. We're shown an amazing variety of fish and animals here, including whales, jellyfish, lobsters, crabs, seals, dolphins, sharks, rarely seen deep sea life, birds, various coral and plant life, and much more. The struggles and rituals of mating, hunting, feeding, and fighting are all uncovered before our eyes. There's just so much to see and learn here. What you know or what you thought you knew about the ocean and oceanlife will be put to the test. For educational and entertainment purposes, this set is truly worth it's weight in gold.

The audio and video are superb. The images are crystal clear and we're given some outstanding close ups which reveal each creature in splendid detail. Words simply cannot describe some of the sights to be seen here. If you've seen Planet Earth, then you'll have an idea of what to expect. The audio adapts easily to DD 5.1 systems. The narration comes across clearly, the music is soulful and appropriate for every scene, and the sound of water, rain and the animals themselves work nicely to the surrounds.

As with Planet Earth, Blue Planet helps to shed the light on the glory of God's creation. As a man of faith, I find it a big faith booster as everything on screen just screams divine design. Because most of us are now trapped in our own concrete jungles, it's just good to get a look at nature and the world we live in. To see, experience and remind ourselves of the beauty and majesty of our planet. Untouched and uninterfered with by the worst and most destructive predators of them all, us. To see life the way it should be, as it was meant to be.

The imagery is truly awe-inspiring (not the teenage 'awesome dude', but the fear of God and Hell kind of awe), and is in itself well worth the price of this DVD 5 times over. One is left, after watching this series, with inkling of an idea of how insignificantly inferior, tawdry, and utterly, infinitely, and absolutely small one is compared to the wonder that is the planet on which we have been given the fortune of conducting our lives.

1735170,4,B000069HXC,"How Does it Look?

I was a little disappointed in the picture quality of many of the segments on these discs. MPEG artifacts abound in areas, appearing as sparkly distortions, especially on the edges of divers as they are interviewed above water. Banding is also evident in many of the underwater scenes, where gradients of overhead light appear as bands of color from light to dark instead of gradual color changes.

These flaws are much less noticeable on disc 5, probably as a result of being mastered using contemporary techniques. My Pioneer DVD player displayed a bitrate of around 7 Mbps on disc 5, as opposed to 5 Mbps on the other discs. It's possible that the other discs might have looked better had they been mastered at a higher bitrate, but that's just a guess.

The BBC did such an incredible job with the HD DVD release of ""Planet Earth"" that my expectations might be unfairly high. We are, after all, comparing a production that is at least 5 years old and on standard definition DVD with a brand new production shot in HD and released on HD DVD. While it may be a bit unfair, it's a result of the combined factor of 1) the BBC setting their own bar very high with the latter production, and 2) not releasing this set on HD DVD for us die-hard nature documentary fans.

If you watch this on a standard definition television smaller than 40"" you probably won't notice the artifacts as much. Such are the limits of standard definition, and further justification for more productions to be released on HD and enjoyed with HD displays.

How Does it Sound?

The soundtrack is two-channel Dolby Digital, which was par for the course back in 2002 for shows like this. As a result, one must temper their expectations after becoming spoiled by the great soundtrack present on the Planet Earth series on HD DVD. Once again, this is an unfair judgement, but a natural one given the timing of this release. However, unlike the flaws in the picture quality that are noticeable on any decent display, the soundtrack here is just fine as it is and does not distract from its core purpose of informing the viewer and filling in gaps in the narration with appropriate segues.

This 5-disc set is a must-see for any nature documentary fan! Its street price is very reasonable for what you get, but I can't help but think that an HD release has to be on the horizon. I don't know if this series will transfer well to HD, but I'll bet it can.

For that reason alone, anyone that has a Blu-ray player may want to hold off and see if a release is forthcoming. Until then, this is the best we have available to us, and it's well worth a look!",1206921600,,2636,4.5

1735196,3,B000069HXC,"Visually, this series is spectacular, and don't get me wrong, I could watch it over and over and over again, and I have.
I have one issue with the series:  The tone of the script gives the animals people like qualities that they have not been proven to have in any kind of scientific way.  It also shows a clear bias for or against several animals based on behavior that is scientifically neither malicious nor benevolent.  For instance, there are several scenes that feature killer whales on the hunt.  Rather than speak of their extraordinary hunting abilities, the writers zeroed in on the more ghastly side of their hunting, and used words like ""cruel"", ""toying"", and ""savage"".  They refer to the prey at one point as ""the little fish"" as if we are supposed to say, ""A[...]""  This anthropomorphizing of the animal kingdom is unscientific and unbalanced.

I gave it only 4 stars because I was unhappy with the music.  It overpowered the narrative.  It was just too loud and pervasive.

This series has superb cinematography, but still holds a second to the Planet Earth series. Ocean life exists deep down and in places least expexcted and this series shows it all.
I recommend it.

All of the photography is superb and some of the shots were downright miraculous.  I didn't think such ""events"" in nature could be captured on film.  I'm still blown away by these ""events"" that I was allowed to experience in the comfort and safety of my own home.  My husband and I fish for Tuna in ""the deeps"" or what we call deep(about 3000 ft).  I always wondered what was going on down there below us.

1735327,5,B000069HXC,"Nature shows used to be half-hour or one hour self-contained episodes that dealt with one specific organism or group of organisms.  Then came cable TV with the likes of Animal Planet, the Discovery Channel, and A&E.  Now, with a paying audience, film makers could splurge and create extended serials on whole ecosystems.  One of the most dramatic examples is The Blue Planet from BBC and distributed by Warner Brothers.  Now released in a 4-disc DVD set, it comprises eight 50-minute episodes, each of which examines one specific aspect of the world's oceans.  Each episode is narrated by Sir Richard Attenborough, and is comprised solely of footage of wildlife; no cut-aways to interviews in a studio, and no intervening video of computer simulations.  Every second of footage is beautiful nature.

The 8 episodes cover the coasts, polar regions, deep sea, coral reefs, islands, open ocean, and mangrove swamps.  Various organims such as fish, marine mammals, crustaceans, echinoderms and medusa are shown.  Footage is provided in both day and night, offering views of how the ocean is a 24-hr city of life.

All in all, a great documentary series and worth the money to buy it.",1185235200,4,1179,5.030927835051546

First, the photography is incredible.  The videographers have the patience, eye, and anticipation to capture images that you really do not realize are IMPOSSIBLE until after you're seen them.  And they do it in such a way that you don't realize what you've seen until after the show is over.

Secondly, the stories and presentations are far beyond what is taught in schools, even at the graduate level.  I learned things and saw things I had never heard of before.  Each segment was more fascinating than the previous one.

I kept trying to watch and see if it was ever going to come on tv again, because i wanted to try to catch it all. I was playing music at night and working in the daytime so it was hard for me to see all of the series. But here some of it was on the ad for Deep Blue. And I wanted it. So I got on [...] and much to my surprise I found Deep Blue and and The collector's set of The Blue Planet. So I ordered both. I had told my sister and her kids and grand kids about The Blue Planet. So I couldn't wait to take it to their house to let them see the amazing filming that was done on this remarkable collection.

This is the most amazing documentary I have seen of the sea: chock full of riveting footage, filled with amazing facts, and never dull.  From bacteria to whales, from the coasts to the open ocean, from the birds that live off the ocean to the deepest ocean floor, from feeding habits to breeding behavior, this series shows you things you could never have imagined.  My sister, who was visiting, was so riveted by the DVD she saw that I will have to send her this series for her birthday.

As someone with an interest in saltwater aquariums, a past member of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, and the parent of a little boy who is obsessed with sea animals (we have lots of books), I thought I knew something about the ocean.  Boy, was I wrong!  I was stunned by what I learned in the first half hour.  This series is a GEM.  We also have some of the IMAX underwater movies, but the material in the Blue Planet just blows IMAX out of the water.

The quality of the video is just wonderful. The series is more than just eye-candy, containing interesting and useful information much like medicine incorporated smoothly into a chocolate truffle. While you sit there enraptured by the images, you find yourself learning a thing or two. The erudition supplied here isn't deep or vast and this series won't be enough to let you pass Oceanography or Marine Biology 101, but the instant scholarship is solid.

The narration was a pleasant surprise. Sigourney Weaver is an often excellent actress, but I hadn't realized how flat and emotionless her narration of ""Planet Earth"" was until I heard Attenborough's narration here. I'm pleased to read that he narrates the ""Planet Earth"" DVD as well. He sounds interested and moved by much of what he describes, unlike Ms Weaver who sounds cold, clinical, and bored half to death. Attenborough breathes life into the beauty of this series.

My favorite episode is The Deep with its plethora of luminescent and transparent animals. We don't need sci-fi space odysseys to behold some of the weirdest-looking creatures imaginable: our own earth supplies them in abundance when we probe ""The Deep.""  I've often thought that God's imagination just exploded when He designed life ""under the sea""--for nowhere else on earth supports such life forms!

We've all been taught since primary school that photosynthesis is the basis for all life.  Well, here we witness life without energy supplied from sunlight---an alternative energy source, sulfur, fuels life in the depths of the ocean. Scientists think that this is how ancient life began, with a similar energy source.  And did you know that there are what appears to be ""lakes"" in the ocean (a body of water submerged within a body of water)?

I love nature documentaries, and this is one of the finest nature documentaries of my awareness. When I travelled to North Carolina this past summer b/c of a family trajedy, my cousins and I were able to distract ourselves from mourning when we popped in a few of these episodes.

1735411,5,B000069HXC,"I bought the DVD ""Deep Blue"", going cheap in the local video shop. It turned out to be a excerpt from this series, so I had to have the whole thing. My one gripe about ""Deep Blue"" was that it lacked explanation for what you were seeing. This has the explanation (by David Attenborough, no less) and more. It is a stunning exploration of most of our planet, the oceans, from the seaside we know to the depths where fewer men have been than have walked on the Moon. Attenborough and the BBC Natural History Unit rewrote the book on nature documentaries with ""Life on Earth""; this is a worthy successor and shows that the BBC has lost none of its touch. You spend much of your time thinking. ""WOW!"" in both of the senses of ""What a great shot!"" and ""How in the name of heaven did they take THAT?""

It also brings to our attention that, although we barely know this awesome world (over half the planet's surface is covered in ocean more than a mile deep), we are doing, as is our custom, a pretty good job of destroying it. As I said about ""Deep Blue"", if this doesn't convert you to an environmentalist, desiring to preserve forever the beauty and fecundity of this marvellous watery world, you are dead.",1169683200,,1201,4.385650224215246

If you liked MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, you will die for THE BLUE PLANET.  I highly recommend this series to anyone.

Of course, like all films there are some minor drawbacks.  Some of the computer-animated scenes are a bit overly fabricated and there are a few excerpts of partially-factual information.  However, this is one not to be missed, a must see for anyone interested in the ocean and a highly recommended series for viewers of all ages.

They managed to film sights that I had never even dreamed existed, and frankly one of my favorite parts is the last 5 minutes of each episode where they show how they filmed some of the shots.  It took 2 years of patience and waiting to get some of these shots and it was well worth it.  Everything from tidal marshes to the depths of the abyss is covered and it is all fascinating.

My only negative content is this is real life and there are a couple of scenes that might be too brutal for younger kids or for sensitive adults.  But there are only a couple of scenes like that and I just close my eyes.  Still, I don't recommend buying these as a gift for a 4-year-old.",1168300800,,791,4.346938775510204

Stunning technical work and content combine to deliver true educational entertainment.

The best home school money we spent this year. The material is presented very clearly and with David Attenborough's thematic style. The individual sessions are one hour and may be taken in any order with no loss.

The dumbing down, glitzing and ""Pop Culturization"" of NatGeo and everything down market of them has left us with little else to compare this work to.

 David Attenborough's quiet emphatic speaking style with natural sound and sparse but still soft music have always [up to now] made the content - not the media and its producers - timeless and truly accessible. [We are truly appalled by the butchering done to the Life On Earth series.] This series brings in more music and it is louder and more evocative however the spoken material and technical work both stand up alone so that the over all experience is simply stunning and amazing.",1168041600,,1025,4.901734104046243

In particular, I was spellbound by the coverage of killer whale attacks.

This series is also comprehensive.  It covers the seas of the arctic and antarctic, deep water, coral reefs, migrations, temperate water, breeding cycles of all kinds of animals.

Plus, the narration is by David Attenborough.  If you have ever watched any of the shows he has narrated, you will know that he is the best narrator out there right now.

The series producer is Alastair Fothergill, who also worked with David Attenborough on ""Life in the Freezer"" (part of the ""Life of"" series, presented by David Attenborough) and more recently, ""Planet Earth"". (also narrated by Attenborough but not part of the ""Life of"" series)

This series has 8 programs and loads of extras. Seeing as no one has listed them yet, I'll do that here...

Disc 1

1. OCEAN WORLD: Experience the power of the Blue Whale - the largest mammal to ever grace our planet. Learn how the sun and moon help control and tame the ocean. Travel far and wide - from the Eastern Pacific to Alaska, from the Bering Sea to the shores of Southern California - and begin to understand the complexity and power of our oceans.

2. FROZEN SEAS: An environment where only the toughest survive, the Arctic and Antarctic are unrelenting habitats. Only in the spring does life begin again. Plankton blooms and feeds vast hordes of migrating fish, walruses rake the seabed for clams, and minke and humpback whales gorge themselves on gigantic swarms of krill. But it is a brief spring feast - the ice soon returns and pushes life back into the ocean.

Extras:

- Behind-the-scenes featurettes

- Interview with cameraman Doug Allan

- Blue Planet music video

Disc 2

3. OPEN OCEAN: In the immense space of the open ocean the sea bed is a staggering five miles below the surface and the nearest island is over 300 miles away. Yet here live many of the most spectacular predators in the ocean. Marvel as you experience ruthless and beautiful battles between hunter and prey.

4. THE DEEP: A place of mountain ranges, perpetual night, pressure extremes and cold... and the weirdest life forms on our planet. Dive to the depths of the ocean, an eerie world where predators with teeth so large they can't even close their mouths, chase bioluminescent creatures of the deep. Discover the spectacular smoking chimneys of the hydrothermal vents. Go deeper down than you have ever been...

Disc 3

5. SEASONAL SEAS: As the days grow longer, billions of microscopic plankton bloom under the blazing sun. Here in the temperate seas, three-ton basking sharks graze among forests of giant kelp - the fastest growing plant in the world. The forests harbor thousands of other animals, including sea otters, brilliantly colored anemones, squid, and exquisite leafy dragons. But as the year wears on, storms rage in the icy sea... a desperate challenge for the animals that remain.

6. CORAL SEAS: Bathed in bright sunlight and warm, clear water, the coral reef is a rich oasis of life - the rainforest of the sea. Bizarrely adorned harlequin shrimp carry off a starfish several times their size, while haunting songs reverberate around the reef, heralding the arrival of humpback whales. Shimmering schools of brightly colored fish battle for territory in this competitive world where you have to stand out to survive.

Disc 4

7. TIDAL SEAS: The sun and moon move billions of tons of water with every turn of the tide. The strongest tides empty entire bays, smash trees on riverbanks, and strand sea creatures on suddenly dry land. Weaker tides control the movements of huge numbers of fish, coaxing schools of giant stingrays through astounding underwater arches. And as the water recedes, the tide can create unbelievable landscapes - like a sparkling world of salt crystals inhabited only by tiny shrimp and bright pink flamingos.

8. COASTS: From rocky cliffs to gentle dunes, the coasts are always changing. Day in and day out, they are battered by crashing waves. Seabirds come here by the thousands to nest, while baby turtles hatch and race to the sea, pursued by hungry predators. Young sea lion pups are born and play on the sand - until a killer whale attacks, crashing in on the surf. But when breeding season is over, life returns to the sea and the shores are empty once again.

This DVD is great, perfect picture quality, and sound. The bonus features are also very good (and quite lengthy) a lot of in-depth information on the making of the series and it is very interesting and amazing.

I haven't watched all of the material yet but so far I am very impressed. Each segment is about 45-50 minutes long, perfect for watching during a single class period. There are 8 segments (2 per DVD), which gives me a lot to choose from! Additionally there is bonus material. The movies are well-organized, easy to follow, and contain some fantastic footage of undersea life. The narration is very nice. I would highly recommend using these in any oceanography, marine biology or even general biology class.  A lot of the material focuses on the struggle for existance, adaptations, predator-prey relationships, surviving in the absence of sunlight or in extreme environments, etc.

  1.  Not all information is correct.  For example, the verbal descriptions of characteristics and habits ascribed to yellow-fin tuna are actually those of blue-fin tuna.  Another error is the statement that all corals live in tropical waters when, for example, some of the most beautiful coral in the world is off Alaska's coast.

  2.  The gratuitous accent on predation panders to the worst side of us.  It gives violence a veneer of acceptability while ignoring predation's benefits, such as strengthening of species and eliminatin of injured or sick individuals.  In The Blue Planet, we can be voyeurs to terror and suffering and let our consciences off the hook by claiming ""science.""

I don't know if this is a natural consequence of using telephoto lenses or because the footage is old, or some picture setting for my DVD player, but it is kind of jarring.

The other problem is that it does not have subtitles. Now, we speak English well enough, we just like subtitles so it's easier to hear what David Attenborough is saying without turning up the volume too high. Also, when he says the names of animals you've never heard of, you'd like to know how to spell these things!

Although all four short documentaries in this set are revealing and educational, I found THE CORAL SEA to be the most astounding. Did you know that there are female and male corals? Or that they bred? And how they mate? I didn't. Just imagine what seeing an entire coral reef sending out breeding stock in one night might look like! It was kind of a ""Wow"" and ""Ewww"" experience all balled into one (no pun intended).

Fast forward another year or so, and I happen to catch this boxed set for under forty, less than ten a disc! I hadn't been able to find tbe others at any stores, and finally went to look here, and got the boxed set right away!  The first disc provides an opener of sorts to the project.  The second disc (the one I owned prior) still stands as the most interesting.  The third has great footage of the Arctic and Antarctic seas, while the fourth (while the slowest, still very good) has some CRAZY footage of a killer whale attacking a seal in very shallow water, and then playing catch with it afterwards.

The sound is absolutely fantastic (I watched on full volume in surround sound), and the visuals are absolutely striking.

The beeping electronic noises played while showing the bioluminescence of deep sea jellies was especially grating - but also the faked sounds of tentacles coiling, sea worms coming out at night, etc - these all really degraded the experience for me.

I know Joe Average Public probably finds the viewing more pleasurable with this stuff added in, but damn it,I'd prefer to interpret the bizarre sights of the underwater world without added sound effects influencing my perceptions and interpretations. It also put me in the annoying position of not being sure which sound effects were real (ex: dolphin chatter - at least I hope that was real!) and which underwater sounds were not - and since the possiblity was clearly there for faked sound effects (beeping jellyfish!), I had to question all of them, and wonder which sounds were genuine and which were dubbed in to make the shots ""more interesting.""

This series is, quite simply, breathtaking. This is an absolute must own for anyone who has an interest in the oceans. Strike that, for anyone at all. This series could well SPARK an interest in the oceans.

The images are absolutely stunning. I've never before seen the amazing quality of photography in this series. All other nature series really pale in comparison, and I'm honestly not exaggerating. This series sets a new standard in nature programming. The wealth of information and gorgeous visuals in this series make it a bargain at twice the price.

If you are even considering purchasing this, I would urge you to do so. I cannot imagine how anyone could be disappointed at this masterpiece.

I don't recall the exact amount of time spent in making these DVD's, but it was a good chunk of time. The photography in these DVD's is unbelievable. There are at so many points when you scratch your head and ask, How in the world did they film that? It is rather incredible.

The patience it must have taken to get these scenes is something I lack for sure. They have captured so many things that you don't see everyday, obviously, and to be able to watch what they have done is priceless, believe me. For example, huge feeding frenzies out in the open ocean, animals of the deep (and I mean deep!), blue whales (a very evasive creature), the list goes on and on. The fact is, they have caught some incredible stuff. It is all a true pleasure to watch.

While watching all this beautiful stuff on the screen you learn some interesting things as well. I personally had no idea that orca whales kill other whales. They've caught an amazing scene of a group of orcas seperating a baby grey whale from it's mother and eating only it's tongue! Incredible stuff.

I think I've said enough. The rest is for you to find our for yourself. Watch this series, it is truly magnificient. This set is well worth the money you pay for it. Give it a try, it is a pleasure to watch.",1111968000,6,1371,4.389763779527559
1735564,5,B000069HXC,"I recently watched all 8 segments of this series and found them far more riveting than I thought I would. Each one was excellent. I am a biologist, but I have to admit, some nature documentaries can be a bit dull, or they try too hard to be exciting by editing unrelated footage together and end up being silly or unrealistic. This BBC series of documentaries was outstanding in every way - even if the footage had been poor, Sir Attenborough's narration is elucidating and interesting and completely worth watching the series for; and if the narration had been dull, the footage is simply stunning and completely worth watching the series for. Together they are outstanding and I found myself often saying ""holy cow - that's amazing!"" Even as a biologist myself, I learned much watching these. I can't recommend these highly enough for everyone - kids, adults, nature buffs, non-nature-buffs, divers, non-divers, non-documentary-buff... even people who don't usually like documentaries or nature stuff can't help but have their interest piqued (as recently proved by my in-laws!).

A note to the sensitive or squeamish - the series doesn't gloss over the reality of sometimes grizzly deaths in nature. The pod of orcas hunting a grey whale and her calf, or snatching sea lion pups from the beach or polar bears ambushing belugas at their only breathing hole may be particularly disturbing. It's real, but not always pretty.

Some high points of the series: underwater footage of polar bears (who can swim hundreds of kilometers); a swirling school of mackerel being simultaneously attacked by dolphin, diving birds, tuna and marlin; bizarre hunting methods of alien animals from the very deep ocean; dolphins driving mullets out of the water to snatch them in mid-air or driving their heads into seafloor to catch buried razorfish; and the endless incredible facts about these creatures delivered by Sir David.

Not to be missed - the extra features (""The Making of"" for each episode, fact files and photo galleries) are every bit as cool as the actual series'.

1735567,5,B000069HXC,"I spent a weekend completely mesmerized by this series.
This is an incredible journey through the oceans of the world. From the freezing poles to the warm water tropics, you meet numerous species and observe them and their habits in incredible detail. There are times when you can't tell if what you're looking at is full size or microscopic, were it not for the narrative. You learn about breeding, defense, hunting tactics, feeding, and migration. From majestic giants like whales, to the tiny plankton so many ocean species live on, there's a lot to learn, and many surprises.
It's an 8-part series:
""Ocean World,"" ""Frozen Seas,"" ""Open Ocean,"" ""The Deep,"" ""Seasonal Seas,"" ""Coral Seas,"" ""Tidal Seas,"" and ""Coasts""
Each episode stands alone, concentrating most on details pertaining to its title. Where Frozen Seas concentrates more on severe weather conditions and the amazing species that can tolerate it, and how they do it, the Tidal Seas episode offers insight to the moons effect on our oceans, and the species that rely on tidal conditions to survive. In The Deep episode, you go to incredible depths, where no sunlight can penetrate and see footage of entire ecosystems that have somehow evolved and survived without the sun. Some of the species in The Deep could easily have been inspiration for many horror film monsters.
Clear, spectacularly vivid imagery, and an excellent narrative by David Attenborough make this series a must see.
I love the ocean, and being at the beach, and have always been curious and cautious about it's inhabitants. Some things I've learned here will not be forgotten. For instance, even the most likable species has to eat, which means it has to hunt and kill. All survival tactics are clever, and necessary, but some are rather cruel. And we certainly can't do more than speculate as to the reasons.
The more we learn about our oceans, the better able we are to respect and appreciate its riches. (and beware it's predators)!",1086998400,5,1967,4.963636363636364
1735568,5,B000069HXC,"For our family, this was the nature documentary series that got us hooked.  We happened upon a Discovery Channel broadcast of one of the Blue Planet episodes, and our 2-year-old was hypnotized.  For at least a year after, every time we turned on the TV, it was ""I want to watch fish!  FISH!!""
While our son likes all of the episodes, I think his favorite is ""Open Ocean,"" which features an amazing sequence of just about every sea-dwelling predator herding and eating a school of anchovies.  For the adult viewer, the narration by David Attenborough is minimalistic and informative.  He really allows the cinematography to steal the show, which it does.  You really do see something new every time.
We have watched these DVDs over and over again, and I'd probably only watch them slightly less if we didn't have kids.  We've given the Blue Planet series to a few other parents as a gift, and have also since bought both The Life of Mammals and The Life of Birds via Amazon.

My only disappointment is in total agreement with what the reviewer named Ghost of Dean Thompson wrote and that is the repetion. I thought I was the only one that noticed this. Howmany times do I need to see a bait ball eaten down to the last fish scale? This was seriosly in almost every episode. I thought that I learned everything there is to know about certain species, like the tuna and bait ball fish, but some were barely touched on. Now I know there is almost too many species to touch on but it would be better to see than the repetions that exist in this series. I would have liked to seen more about the inhabitants on the coral reefs like the morays, the numerous crabs, and mostly the intelligent octupus, which in not even shown. What I am saying is that what always grabs me in any of Sir David's series is the revelations about animals that I did not know before.
One of the best parts of this collection is found in the ""extras"". I really think that the one about the destruction on sealife that is done daily by commercial fisherman is the one that everyone on this planet needs to see. The indescriminant nets catch and kill everything. The fisherman take what the were fising for, for example all the prawns, and the rest of the catch is left to die then dumped back in the ocean. I wanted to cry, shout, scream, and beat up those fishermen for there total lack of caring for the environment that they make their living from. Their relentless fishing will someday very soon, annihilate entire species. My dad raises cattle but he doesnt go out into the field and kill everything in sight just for some hamburger. Fishermen need to learn that fish need to breed and the young need to grow in order to replenish their stocks and insure them future jobs in fishing.

1735572,5,B000069HXC,"the camera work is phenomenal and is generally edited very well -- in the behind the scenes extra you see how much inactivity the crew had to sit through to get the final footage.
David Attenborough is his usual self, soft spoken and easy to understand while being informative.
the series as noted deals with different segments of the ocean from the beginning Ocean World (a general overview) to the Coasts (as he saids, the most dynamic) and i suspect if you have even a remote interest in marine life there is something in this series for you.
my favorite is disk two with Open Ocean and The Deep; not coincidently, i find these two to be have the best cinematography. the images of marlins and tunas exploding through a huge tightly packed school is remarkable until hear Attenborough announces 'they have attracted a giant' and a whale materializes out of the blue depths.
this entire series is shot in enhanced resolution so most of the footage is very sharp -- but none more so than in The Deep (with the black background and the lack of suspended particles); it seems unreal in clarity. deep water footage is harder to get due to the specialized equiptment necessary to withstand the immense pressure so i shouldn't have been surprised to see something completely new... Attenborough takes you to what looks to be underwater lake -- it's water of the highest salinity and is denser than surrounding waters so it kind of collects like a lake -- this is described in greater detail in one of the behind the scenes features. just astonishing.
i've watched this series several times and really enjoyed each time; with the exception of Ken Burn's Civil War, i have never been so impressed a documentary series.",1073433600,2,1712,4.729096989966555

It is THE most amazing piece of wildlife footage EVER captured on film - even surpassing the National Geographic special with the Great White Sharks breaching.
If you need more reasons than that, the ""Ocean World"" DVD contains unbelievable footage of Sir David in a skiff right above a Blue Whale (the largest creature ever to have lived) along with a stirring segment about an orca pod pursuing a gray whale and her calf.

""Ocean World"", the first installment, is a stunning overview of the series. If you decide to purcahse only one of these discs, this is the one to choose. There are images herein that will haunt you long after you've put the disc away. The production team's gift seems to be to be able to find massive numbers of one kind of creature gathered in one place. Many such scenes are presented, and each is stunning. New images from the deep ocean are shown in ""The Deep"", and this is the series at its mosts awesome. ""Coral Seas"" is probably the low point, since, while beautiful, it suffers from the worst of the series' flaws (see below).
Of note to parents: there are two very frightening scenes in the first episode (one of which is repeated in ""Coastal Seas""), and I recommend you watch before letting any sensitive youngsters join in.
And now to the flaws. The producers made some strange choices which detract from the series' power. Each segment, and some more than others, have been augmented with oddly chosen and jarring sound effects, trick photography and computer-generated animations.
These techniques are used to great effect in many of the sequences, but in others are markedly deleterious. We see deep-sea bioluminescent creatures that are given ""beep"" noises when they display. We are shown coral growing at an accelerated rate, but are not told that this is a computer enhancement. In ""Seasonal Seas"" we see bryozoans emerging from their casings to a ridiculous ""sploit"" sound.
The fact that these augmentations are annoying is excusable, but what is not excusable is that the viewer has no idea when a particular sound or image reflects reality, or is the figment of some over-zealous post-production technician's imagination. A case in point is the waving arms of a basket star shown in ""Coral Seas"": I am fairly certain that basket stars cannot move that quickly, but from this video I would have no idea. I think many viewers will come away misinformed.
Such trickery is unacceptable in a production that purports to be a documentary, and detracts from the BBC's strong history of realist programming.
Still, even with these flaws, Seas of Life is a masterwork. You will not be disappointed.",1067212800,12,2576,4.93778801843318
1735576,5,B000069HXC,"We've ventured out in space and we barely know our own planet!  What we see in this 6 1/2 hour DVD set, took several years to create.  The images alone are breathtaking.",1066694400,,169,4.25
1735577,4,B000069HXC,"I heard of this program long before I saw it.  It was praised well above everything else--it was hailed a new landmark in nature documentaries.  Saddly, I need to say I disagree.  Why give it a 4 out of 5 then?  It's still amazing.  Still better than most anything coming out from PBC, BBC, Discovery, whatever.  But that doesn't mean it is up to the standards that Attenborough has set.  Though someone correct me if I'm wrong, but is this even by Attenborough or just narrated by him?

The reason I ask is because in almost all cases, Attenborough's 'Life' series (as it's come to be known) shows some sort of internal organization that becomes essential in keeping the gigantic series from turning into a big chaotic jumble.  'Life on Earth' used geological and evolutionary time to seperate its various episodes while 'Trials of Life' focuses on how the universal trials that all life faces are met.  Elsewhere, Attenborough catagorizes his show in someway that you always have a sense of where you are within the epic work (I think only one of his programs is less than 6 hours, so 'epic' feels pretty appropriate.)

This is precisely what 'The Blue Planet' is lacking and I'm surprised to see no other reviewers echoing this sentiment.  There is simply a LOT of repetition.  Poor sardines get killed over and over by hordes of dolphins, gulls, tuna, sharks and even whales that one begins to feel quite sorry for them.  It was quite awesome to see it the first time, but these attacks show up in 3 or 4 programs as I recall.  The lack of organization is even reflected in the absense of an episode number or previews for other episodes.  In short, instead of 'The Blue Planet' being one complete work, it is instead 8 self contained episodes that do not feel compelled to contain exclusive material, themes, etc.

Where 'the blue planet' stands out is (as stated elsewhere) the deep sea episode.  This one is truly a keeper and will amaze everyone who sees it.  The other episodes are also quite good, and cinematically they are staggering.  What isn't here is a story--and let's be honest, that's what Attenborough does best, capturing our imagination with grand themes unfolding, giving us at last a greater world view than we had before.  The Blue Planet however has no story, no greater message, no beginning nor culmination.  It is 8 seperate installments about life in the sea...and I'm afraid, nothing more.",1063843200,10,2420,4.725536992840095
1735578,5,B000069HXC,"This is just an absolutely breathing taking series. The photography is utterly amazing. The narative is great, informative and well paced. It is with good reason that other reviewers say to watch this on HDTV (and a home theater system) though it's still incredible if you have a regular tv.
All four parts are great. A small warning for young kids though, the end of one of the DVD's shows killer whales ""playing"" with a seal pup. Not playing nice -- but tossing it like a ball between them. Otherwise, it's pretty tame (well, there are fish swalling other fish whole, but nothing grusome",1063065600,3,589,4.673076923076923

I brought them to my friends house to watch on their big screen HDTV with their children and the kids were amazed.  You actually felt like you were there.  The most amazing ocean footage ever shot.  I am thinking about the ""Life of Mammals"" series now.  Every kid should see Blue Planet.",1053302400,,367,4.417910447761194
1735580,4,B000069HXC,"This is a beautifully filmed and presented documentary series, though that goes without saying if it's done by David Attenborough and his crew. I'm not sure if it's my cheap DVD player or the discs themselves, however, that are the cause of my only complaint. The music and effects, especially in the opening episode are so loud compared to Attenborough's narration that it must be turned up to an almost uncomfortable level to understand him over it. Coming from the Life of Birds series, which is flawless IMO, this was a disappointment. The scenes caught on film certainly are not! The episode travelling down to the deepest regions of the ocean provide probably the most fascinating visuals you'll ever see. You will literally be amazed that such creatures are actually a living part of the world that are almost completely unknown to anyone.",1052092800,22,846,4.923076923076923
1735581,5,B000069HXC,"I got the Blue Planet for Christmas, and when I saw the blue whale (Ocean World), the footage was phenomanal, as was the killer whales hunting the gray whale calf! I enjoyed the slow-motion-view of the emperor penguins slipping onto the ice (Frozen Seas). I thought that everything was cool on Open Ocean (for example, a striped marlin hunting for fish). I wouldn't say ""The Deep"" was the best one, but I did like the hairy anglerfish (only seen 1 time) and the sperm whale rising for a last breath for over an hour to dive 1000 meters down into the deep ocean. The grey seals were cool in ""Seasonal Seas"", as was the 3-ton basking shark. A giant whale shark and singing humpback whales made ""Coral Seas"" #3 in the 4. ""Tidal Seas"" was 100% awesome seeing 500 fin whales opening their giant mouths to filter-feed krill. ""Coasts"" was my least favorite, because, you know, they were usually shore animals except for the killer whale at the very end. I have 13 other films by David (the 12-set ""Trials of Life"" and ""Survival Island."" I think David is the best documentist ever.",1049587200,2,1073,4.564766839378239
1735582,5,B000069HXC,"There isn't a moment in these four DVD's that won't have you gazing in wonder and admiration at the effort and amazing footage captured in this series. Of all the DVD's I own, and that is no small number I assure you, this entire set never sits long enough to get more than a days worth of dust on it. I often watch an episode as I linger in bed waiting for sleep to overtake me. Equally as often, I have to switch it off so I can get sleep--it is that unendingly fascinating. No matter how many times I've watched it, the presentation and simply astounding events they have captured in this series always manage to keep my attention. To even try and relate what the hours of footage reveal would only do it an injustice. I won't even try and I'm sure others could describe it better than I. Let me say this, if you have never seen Blue Planet then you have been sorely missing out. It most certainly contains footage of the marine world that cannot be seen anywhere else. Not merely a few minutes here and there but nearly every minute of the series is unique and nearly unbelievable to behold.
 Yes, I realize that it sounds like I'm waxing over this set in glowing terms--and I am, but for good reason. Don't rent these, don't borrow them from a friend and certainly don't just wait around trying to decide if this set is for you. Just click the order button right now and make this set your own. After you do, I think you'll agree it is among the best documentaries ever created, and simultaneously, one of the best DVD investments you've made.",1046304000,174,1548,4.356401384083045

The rest of the time is talking heads or illustrations, right? This program is completely the opposite. It's all jaw-dropping, stunning stuff moment after moment. I walked away from The Deep Episode feeling privileged that I had the chance to see these unbelievable animals. Much of it was so incredible that it was more like watching a science fiction movie than a nature show. Equally, watching a pod of eight killer whales drowning a grey whale was some of the most gripping footage I have ever seen. The only drawback was that some episodes seem to lack direction but on the whole I was spellbound. Highly recommended.",1044489600,2,767,4.774436090225564
1735584,5,B000069HXC,"Another classic you won't want to stop watching.  Don't start watching this late at night because you will not want to stop.
The frozen ocean episode is my favorite.  Just thinking about how they filmed this is enough to boggle the mind.  The penquins swimming and practically sailing onto ice floes is enough to bowl you over.
The deep episode is so surreal as to seem unbelievable.  This is the episode that has the added sounds (listen to the added special feature interview with the director to learn more about that).  Is there no sound in the deep?  I don't know but the added sounds are perfect for the creatures viewed.
I don't know how these BBC film-makers do what they do but this set is simply brilliant.  Sir David Attenborough's narration, as always, is informative without seeming either too dry and scientific or too simplistic.
Buy it and enjoy it over and over again.",1041465600,6,885,4.670967741935484
