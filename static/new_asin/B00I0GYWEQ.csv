8638031,2,B00I0GYWEQ,I was so furious when I bought this and got it home then realized at least five of the episodes were not included and couldnot get a hold of anyone to complain or get the missing episodes. I am an avid fan of this show but obviously you don't always get what you pay for. Had I known then what I know now I wouldn't have purchased it.,1412294400,4,334,3.926470588235294
8638032,2,B00I0GYWEQ,"There are 8 episodes, instead of 10 as listed on both Amazon and the DVD cover. I bought this with volume one, which is missing ""Requiem for a Hero,"" though it's listed as one of the included episodes.",1406505600,2,201,4.315789473684211
