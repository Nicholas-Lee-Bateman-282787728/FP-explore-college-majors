5991762,1,B00FGTU43I,"For the two people out there who noticed that I've reviewed several Full Moon products of late, you noticed my growing disatisfaction with the work of Charles Band. The Puppet Master movies have become dreck, the studio's newer movies have been increasing unwatchable, and any attempt to make great movies like they once did has been utterly abandoned.

Now, we have GMvEB, which I much say, is probably the single worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to watch. I actually liked the first couple GM movies as they were at least campy enough to make me chuckle when I was drunk. The EB never appealed to me but I understand they have a specific audience and I'm not a part of it. However, each of these franchises' installments have included less and less of what we want from horror comedies - horror and comedy! The third installments of each were nearly impossible to watch. GMvEB, however, is the very worst of both combined. The kill scenes are almost non-existant (I've seen Sandra Bullock movies with bigger body counts!) and they are sparse and uninspired. EB doesn't actually do anything in this movie besides make a couple stock comments to the characters, who don't even seem to know what they are doing.

My wife, who usually indulges in these movies for the camp factor, walked away from this one after 5 minutes. I later was able to accurately sum up the rest of the movie as such: Nearly half a movie of flashbacks (ARGH!!!!) followed by GM chasing the two main characters. They go into Bong world, GM follows, they leave, he doesn't. NOTHING HAPPENED! Even the character of Rabbit wasn't very funny, and I usually look forward to his scenes.

I highly recommend that you find something else to watch should this film cross your mind as a viable source of entertainment. Anything else, for that matter, would be better than this. Except another contemporary Full Moon movie. For me, I'm done with this company. I cannot understand how they lost their way, and I've given up caring. I will watch their stuff from the 90s and remember when direct-to-video wasn't a bad thing.",1391731200,8,2094,4.715846994535519
5991763,1,B00FGTU43I,This movie was garbage! 70 min long and 20 min of scenes from past movies in the series. Fullmoon continues to DISAPPOINT ME! stay away from this movie much like all there movies the past few years. Ooga booga. Unlucky charms. Evil bong 3. Gingerdead man 3 all r pure crap! I miss the good ol days of fullmoon. But those days r loooong gone. They only make 2 new films each year for christs sake! Its the end of a era for fullmoon i believe. Out of money. Out of ideas! Hang it up mr band. Your fullmoon stream isn't working either. Its just a way for u to con people into giving u money every month but only make 22 new films per year. And half the stuff on his site ARE NOT FULLMOON TITLES BUT OLD CRAPPY MOVIES!  LIKE i said. Out of ideas. Out of money. Out of BRAINS! IM DONE WITH FULLMOON. NOTHING BUT DISAPPOINTMENT!,1391472000,4,822,4.1375

5991766,4,B00FGTU43I,If you are a fan of the Gingerdead Man or Evil Bong movies then you know what your getting with this movie. Yes gingerdead man looks horrible in this movie but this is a Full Moon Studio film. They are beyond low budget. The death scenes are classic b horror style and yes guys you will see lots of breasts. If you want a good laugh and actually love Full Moon buy this dvd. Im glad i did.,1430006400,3,389,4.0

5991769,5,B00FGTU43I,"So, I read other reviews on here, and I guess to most people this movie was a let down. To me, though, low budget movies are fun to watch, pick on, and just have my brother, myself, and his fiance' to have our own little MST 2000. Charles Band has produced, directed, and written better films, but still I look to what kind of production company Full Moon is. I expect the cheesy, funny actors, the low budget quality, the whole shot. I don't watch these movies because they are Hollywood blockbusters, I watch them because of what I just mentioned. The fact that Charles Band grabbed his grapes and went outside of the Hollywood jargon and has made movies the way he wanted to, and loves what he does, what better example could one give about the American dream? I always give five stars to movies from Full Moon, or anything relating to Charles Band, though. Just my personal view.",1426464000,,883,4.490683229813665

8615624,4,B00FGTU43I,"This is a very comical and entertaining movie. I myself like humor in horror films and this one has a lot of it, especially with the goof balls in the smoke shop. If you're a fan of either Gingerdead or Evil Bong you'll find this film to your liking because the two meet (and swear each other out). There's flash backs from other films so you'll get a good idea how the stories went if you haven't seen them yet.",1477094400,,412,4.1625
