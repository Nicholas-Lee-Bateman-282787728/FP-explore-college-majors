1684915,3,B000062XFK,"...a wistful story about a middle aged man who's been burned and now it's time to get on with his life.
Thirty years ago Vinnie was a teen idol and the front man for Vinnie and the Dreamers, a doo-wop group from Brooklyn.  Now, Vinnie is in his late forties and works as a bartender in Brooklyn.  His wife died years ago of cancer.  He has two sons at home, just starting to make their way in the world, but his teenage daughter is in the hospital with serious cancer.
Vinnie hadn't dated a woman since his wife died.  He's very bitter over the Dreamers because he never benefited financially.  He gets together socially a few times with old group.  A reunion is planned, but  it seems they all have resentments and grudges that need to be resolved.
It's a very nice portrayal of an Italian-American family in Brooklyn.  The close relationship between Vinnie, his two sons and daughter gave me a warm feeling, especially between the father and sons.
One of Vinnie's sons is just breaking in as a pop musician and song writer.  His musical presence gives a nice, contemporary balance to the doo-wop.  As a musician, he is able to connect with his father, and he gently prompts him to get on with his life.  As a film about a retired doo-wop singer, I felt the vocal performances of the doo-wop could have been better.  But who knows, maybe they didn't want this to be labeled simply a , ""Doo-Wop,"" movie.  All elements in the movie were extremely well balanced.
I enjoyed the Bay Ridge setting, since we used to live on the edge of Bay Ridge.  The accents, the buildings, restaurants, and the clothes were all the real Bay Ridge.  The Italian-American thing is not overdone.
Some might say the movie is slow or dull, but it take a while for the story to build.  The spirit of the music keeps it from getting too heavy.  I doubt others will enjoy it as much as I did...",1026604800,15,1867,4.428152492668621
1684916,5,B000062XFK,"I just love this movie.  It is a feel good story, and the music takes you back to yesterday when groups sang in harmony, and looked to be discovered.  The movie has a wonderful cast, and Armand Assante gives a moving performance in this story.  It is one I would view over and over again.  The story is wonderful, and the music is great.  Please don't miss this movie.",1025222400,6,368,4.27536231884058
1684917,5,B000062XFK,"This is one teriffic little film. As one who experienced the fame at age 16 and was out of the business at age 18, I was very  emotionally attached to this story. The cast had it right -on! The music by Kenny Vance, particularly the arrangement of ""This I Swear"" was so perfect and so pure, that anyone experiencing it can not help but be moved back to another place ..and another time. Thank God the title is ""Looking for an Echo"" ...Vance' homage to the golden era or I would have probably missed it on the video shelf.
Rent It...Buy It...Love it!",1024531200,7,549,4.330097087378641
1684918,5,B000062XFK,"What a pleasant, sincere and heart-warming little movie!  While it may not have been nominated for any awards, it is an intelligently done story, with a fine and well-selected cast.  Armand Assante, as the central character Vinny, is quite believable--he has ""the look"" of a teen idol, thirty years or so after the fact.  The supporting cast is terrific, especially Christy Carlson Romano, who, as Vinny's daughter Tina, is absolutely charming!  The soundtrack, provided by Kenny Vance and the Planotones, is mesmerizing--as I've said before, Kenny's voice is without equal - he is the finest lead singer I have ever heard, and I grew up in the 50's & 60's! You won't go wrong by buying this movie.  Guaranteed to make you feel good! Also, do yourself a favor and get the soundtrack CD.  It's fantastic!",1023840000,7,803,4.867647058823529
1684919,5,B000062XFK,"Those of us who grew up in the 50's - 60's will especially enjoy this movie.  The story of what happened to a teen idol (Vinnie) and his group (The Dreamers) is very moving.  Because singing groups of those times were not properly rewarded financially, Vinnie is left with nothing but memories for his efforts.  His bitterness causes him to put his pass and exceptional voice aside.  Fortunately for him, his son and newly found girlfriend manage to get Vinnie to relive some of the glory days of Vinnie and The Dreamers.
Combined with another storyline of Vinnie's young daughter's battle with cancer, the movie brings out many emotions.  Except for the unnecessary use of vulgar language, the entire family can enjoy this movie.
Kenny Vance and The Planotones who provide the vocals for the movie and soundtrack have made ""Looking For An Echo"" a very popular song today for oldie lovers.  I strongly suggest purchasing the soundtrack if you love oldie music.",1020556800,7,960,4.858895705521473

Nostalgic yet modern, this is a film that will make you feel wonderful after watching it and will stick in your mind. It's a story of hope, dreams, and spirit hidden in us all.

1685011,2,B000062XFK,"The music is fine, although ""I Swear"" is used a little too frequently. The plot is very weak. I had a difficult time trying to figure out what the premise is. The main character and female lead are OK, but the supposed conflict between the father and son isn't convincing. I love Kenny Vance and the Planotones who did the soundtrack. The title song is absolutely beautiful. I liked it long before I knew there was a film. I don't think I would watch it again.",1426636800,,460,4.3604651162790695

1685051,5,B000062XFK,"Having grown up in New York during the 50s and 60s this movie did convey the cool part of that era. Im not a big fan of worthless cursing or vulgarity, but some of the language in this film (adult content) is, quite honestly, realistic.
Other than that, the story and production were  very refreshing.

No graphic violence, nudity, and the main character doesnt have to shack up or one night stand the girl he loves.

If you like old school, as opposed to new-age dysfunctional psycho-sexual melodrama, this is a good one to see.

A good love story from an honorable mans perspective. This ranks as one of the top 25 movies Ive ever seen.",1390867200,3,638,4.474137931034483
1685052,5,B000062XFK,"The music is awesome, even if Assante doesn't actually do the singing.  Then I went on ITunes and bought the album!  The story is almost typical ""Chick Flck"" if it wasn't for the music that applies to all of us.  We can relax to these old tunes.  It makes me wonder how the kids of today are going to relax years later to Snoop Dog, Metallica, 50 Cent (and his ""music"" is worth even less) and the rest of that ""music"" ilk?",1390694400,,422,4.109756097560975
1685053,4,B000062XFK,This is a great movie. The fact I know some was lip sinked is the only reason it didn't get 5.  My middle daughter loves it and I must tell her is here to steam! !,1385337600,,163,3.5277777777777777

1685137,5,B000062XFK,I really enjoyed the story line and of course the music. I can relate to this movie because of the age group I am in. It brings back lots of great memories.,1331424000,,156,3.90625
1685138,5,B000062XFK,"C Am F and G....the four chords that ruled the Doo  Wop world. Close harmonies and falsettos paved the way for romance and street corner groups.

Vinnie Pirelli has seen the hearthrob world pass him by with little to show for it. He bartends and plays in a supper club combo to earn his keep but is hovering in Brooklyn without much direction. Lonely as his wife died of cancer ten years earlier he has a life that is predictable until his daughter Tina is stricken with cancer.
Her role is terrific and she delivers the goods many times over.

One son is an aspiring musician, the other a public servant cop. Ballerini as the musical prodigy is also splendid in his role showcasing not only music chops but is wise in the ways of being in an Italian family.

Another well played scene is the budding relationship between Vinnie and his new love, the nurse Jo Anne. It shows a wonderful glimpse of what it is like to be in an older romantic
situation. Truly believable.

The music however is the real star of this little gem of a movie. I saw Kenny Vance and the Planotones (the real music singers for this film) on a PBS special last month singing the title song and they were simply ""fabulous.""

Family, whether they be the members of your teenage group....Dedication to the music that changed the world....or Friendship are the cornerstones of this wonderful film.

It deserves a wider audience!

This would be a marvelous family film save for the language (necessary but could be offensive to some) and the constant smoking of Armand Assante who delivers the goods as the ""stuck"" but immensely talented Vinnie.

Do yourself a favor and buy this film and be prepared to sing! Do Doo Doo Do!",1329350400,,1693,4.561056105610561
1685139,4,B000062XFK,"It's a little hokey, but if you're a doo wop fan like me, you'll love this movie.  Kenny Vance and the Planotones, who are gifted entertainers if you have ever seen them in person, do the actual singing for the actors.",1319414400,2,218,4.317073170731708
1685140,5,B000062XFK,"Interesting story line; music fantastic! If you love late 50's and early 60's music, you will enjoy this.  Kenny Vance is as good as ever.",1318291200,2,138,4.52
1685141,3,B000062XFK,"The movie was basically about an old Doo Wop group's reflections of what might have been.  A couple of other themes that were integrated into the movie were the romance between a nurse and ""Vinnie"", the aging leader of the  Doo Wop group called Vinnie and the Dreamers. A second sub theme was that of a father's pain of a his daughter in the hospital in undiagnosed critical condition.  The two themes work together because one of the daughter's nurses is the gal ""Vinnie"" is interested in.  There are family squabbles throughtout, but in the end everything seems to work out.  If you like a little nostalgic Doo Woppy type songs (mostly in the background of scenes) you may like this film.  The biggest drawback for me was the  excessive use of the ""F"" word.  This could have been a good family oriented picture had it not been for that, and the over-board reactions of ""Vinnie"" at times.  For me the last scene of the picture was worth waiting for.  I would love to be able to share my copy with friends, but because of the profanity, I will not.",1318118400,2,1048,4.468421052631579

David Black (n Blatt) of ""The Empires"" took his place (after first agreeing to adopt the name Jay Black). He still tours today and still has a great set of pipes.
But Kenny was a member of Jay and the Americans. He left and went on to be a successful singer and music producer. He still sings today as lead singer of his group Kenny Vance and the Planotones.

1685166,4,B000062XFK,"In a rather forgettable angst-filled Ingmar Bergman film, one angst-filled character says to another angst-filled character--and I paraphrase: ""Are some people better at life than others?""

Yes, the film ""Looking for an Echo"" would exclaim: some peoples' lives are blessed with magic.

Vinnie, a former teen idol, has that magic. Despite significant challenges later in his life, (which can be correctly guessed at from miles away) the challenges are resolved (their resolutions can also be correctly guessed at from miles away) and Vinnie's charmed life continues on its magical way.

Cliches of cliches; all is cliche. . .there is nothing new under the sun in this predictable movie.

Yet cliche is more watchable than angst. This movie, if you can overlook the cliches--which is not always easy, is moving. Most particularly moving is the music, which is--allow the word again, allow the cliche--magical.",1276128000,,907,5.321678321678322

It only added to my love of this movie that it takes place in Brooklyn(where my late Dad was born and raised..and where I have spent some time).  You don't have to be a doowop fan to enjoy this movie; I wasn't really into doowop back then(though now I have renewed interest).  This is a movie a family can watch, enjoy and where each person can find someone in the movie or something to relate to.

This is one of the few movies that I won't ever tire of seeing.",1126569600,6,859,4.213414634146342
1685193,5,B000062XFK,"I LOVED this movie...Edoardo Ballerini stole the show as Armand Assante's son..will never forget his singing ""I SWEAR"".Armand did not put much feeling or emotion into his singing(tho neither father  nor son actually sing the songs). Story line was great as was the acting..One aside to the DVD, I bought the ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK, only to find that ""THIS I SWEAR"" was sung by someone else(never heard of the guy, he does broadway or something) in the movie than was put on the CD..the movie version was MUCH better. If you listen closely, you can't miss the emotional difference between the two versions..",1107216000,3,603,4.911764705882353

If you love music, and have heard some fifties music, the kind that you just have to involuntarily sway and bob to....then this is your movie.  It's wonderful, with a storyline and characters completely full bodied. And the music!  Armand Assante playing against his usual form.  And Diane Venora, a character so charasmatic, Assante isn't the only one that falls for her.  We do, assisted by the best music score in a film since the Commitments!  I love this movie!

I felt so good while viewing the movie that I had to sit through it a second time.  The characters are precise and real, the music is the best there ever was, and the whole story is wrapped together in a mixture of love, friendship, good times and bad, and a dose of sentamentality.  Absolutely fantastic!!!!!!!!  Too bad we can't bring back those days for real...........they were the best.  Thanks to everyone involved with making this movie.

1685197,5,B000062XFK,"I thought Armand Assante reached his pinnacle in ""The Mambo Kings.""  He worked his heart out in that movie, and I didn't think it was possible for him to get any better. But he's outdone himself with ""Looking for an Echo.""  There's no limit to this actor's talent and, for that matter, the talent of the entire cast.  The story, the songs and the actors are phenomenal.  Anyone who can't thoroughly enjoy this movie will never recognize or appreciate a truly great movie when they see it.  A must see for anyone who lived through the '50s and '60s and the kids today who are learning about it from their parents who did. What I want to know is, when is the Academy going to recognize Assante's talent and nominate him for an Oscar?",1070582400,,731,4.425373134328358

1685203,5,B000062XFK,"Armand Assante is a favorite of mine.  I loved all of his movies. I was so suprised to see him in a doo-wap role, but he was fantastic as always.  His emotional performance of a man who lost his wife to cancer and is now dealing with the potential loss of his daughter from the same disease is heartwrenching. His relationship with his two sons also brings reality to a parent's love for his children, and the torment of his past singing career. He and his singing group of the 50's  made one big hit, but were soon removed from the limelight.  Over the next 30 years, he works as a bartender and his group plays for weddings. If you love doo-wap and Assante, you'll love this movie.  Nostalgia at its best.  I recommend getting the Audio CD and playing it before seeing the movie, then you will really enjoy it.",1031011200,5,812,4.344370860927152
1685204,5,B000062XFK,"I am a self-proclaimed doo-wop  junkie, that finally saw a movie to do this music proud! I recently had the pleasure of seeing Kenny Vance and the Plantotones perform, which  moved me to purchase the CD and the DVD!  A fine cast, and heart-felt story combines with the music to make ""Echo"" a movie you can watch more than once.  This is a real ""sleeper"", that needs to wake up more viewers!",1028592000,6,390,4.375
1685205,4,B000062XFK,"It is a good thing to watch a lesser known works that turn out actually better than you expected.  Now you got another one here, with Armand Assante and Daine Venora (Mrs. Michael Mann), who had been long ill-used in Hollywood blockbusters like ""Judge Dredd"" and Bruno's ""The Jackal"" respectively.  But you should know that they deserve much, much better things than those, and you will understand what I mean after watching this little-seen film.

""Looking for an Echo"" (the title comes from Kenny Vance's 1996  album) is about an Itarian middle-aged man Vince (Assante) whose wife had passed away, and lives now with his son, an aspiring musician.  And Vince himself, back in the 1960s, was the leader of the hit chorus group ""Vinnie and the Dreamers,"" but is now totally retired from spotlight.  But when he meets and falls in love with a nurse Joanne (Venora), who happens to have been a huge fan of his group, he gradually feels the impulse he had long lost.  As Vince reunites with his old buddies, he knows, and we know, that his love for good-old songs are never dead.

Though my summery may lead you to think that the film goes on with a big showdown in sight, the fact is different.  The story gives more stress to the budding relations between Vince and Joanne (and his son), showing how they come to love (or understand) each other.  Songs are playing a major part, but their roles are aptly subdued, with a script that cleverly avoids clithed moments.  The film unfolds very quietly, letting us into the close picture of family and friends that every viewer can relate to.  In this sense, ""Looking for an Echo"" resembles Tom Hanks film ""That Thing You Do"" with a difference that the former gives us a credible picture of former stars living the present while the latter directly leads us into the world of relations surrounding a pop-song group.

The film refers to many chorus groups like ""The Dells"" and ""The Harptones,"" so if you can sing a song or two of them, you will like the sound you can hear in the film, which is vividly realized by Kenny Vance, who was the leader of ""Jay and The Americans.""  Many say rightly that this is a homage to doo-wap songs even though, as I said, the relations between characters come to the forefront in the story.  But it is also true that its moody soundtrack does justice to the film's title and your expectation based on that.

Finally, though the film looks as a whole slightly light-weight, it gives a rare occasion for American film to introduce the love between man and woman aged more than 40.  This is a bit surprise because the film succeeds in that place too, especially when you see Diane Venora clad in fancy dress.  And I wonder why she has to be wasted in a pointless Hollywood remake, doing a very thankless role while she can enliven the screen single-handedly as is shown here.",1026864000,36,2848,4.572834645669292
