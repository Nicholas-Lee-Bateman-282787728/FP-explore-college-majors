3421191,4,B0018TN72U,"I enjoyed this documentary very much, it gave a uniqie propective of what would happen to a world without humans, something most of us have wondered and fantisized about once or twice in our lives.  The graphic details seemed percisced and the narration put everything in it's place as the viewer was watching. Although some of the graphics appeared somewhat flawed in their appearance, but I guess aside from waiting for this to actually happen, it was the next best thing.  I personally liked the ideal of not knowing what happened to the humans, it allows the viewer think of his /or her own ideals.",1245542400,3,602,4.723809523809524
3421192,1,B0018TN72U,"Most of this was done tongue in cheek,  completely disregarding fact and just kinda writing as they went...  was an interesting point of view,  but not likely.  Most of the premise relied on dis proven climate theories.",1245456000,2,219,4.837837837837838
3421193,4,B0018TN72U,"My writing partner and I wrote a scifi novel about life in a climate-induced, post-apocalyptic city in the U.S.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reality-Crash/dp/0615263267/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reality Crash</a>&nbsp;Despite our exhaustive research, there are still some things detailed in this documentary that we hadn't considered. Aftermath was definitely eye-opening. And with good production values. Naturally, some things had to be CGI, but there were so many shots with real animals, lending a stark reality to the whole thing. I thought it was quite good, and certainly thought-provoking.",1232323200,6,644,6.962962962962963
3421194,4,B0018TN72U,"If you haven't seen ""Life After People,"" as I have, then you'll surely appreciate this program more than I did.  But I did not find it better than ""Life After People.""  You get a slightly different perspective, of course, but there is plenty of general overlap.  I felt this program was a bit repetitive in places and seemed to dwell on some favorite matters, like the Eiffel Tower.  I got plenty tired of seeing the Eiffel Tower topple. Perhaps because I saw this on DVD, I was jarred by some of the transitions, which seemed more suited to TV.  But the narrative and tone of ""Life After People"" seemed more effective to me than in this program.",1229040000,39,646,4.487179487179487
3421195,5,B0018TN72U,"Well, after the atomic plants blow up and many of the pets die off and the cars stop running, things start to get wild.  Really wild.  Trees take over, cities become cooler, the oceans start to fill up with fish.  National Geographic really hooked me, with great effects, real animals like tigers running about, and just a really cool ride.  But it also shows us that, with a little more work on our part, we may be able to correct some of the damage we've done to our own planet.
The more we understand about how the Earth works the more we can do to help it.  Maybe clean up the oceans, the atmosphere and the land without having to die off first.  Give a hoot.",1225929600,10,663,4.222222222222222
3421196,4,B0018TN72U,"These days, with so many people on the planet, there have been many a day when I thought that there were simply too many of us, and how grand it would be if a good many simply disappeared into thin air. However, after viewing National Geographic's ""Aftermath - Population Zero"", I realized just how devastating, and deadly, matters would quickly turn out there should the on-going maintenance of key places on the planet cease even a short period of time.

Intentionally or not, humans have set-up shop here on this planet in such a way that should a large proportion of us suddenly disappear due to some unforeseen event the demise of the remaining survivors would be sudden and swift.

Once this dvd starts it will have your attention and you will learn a great deal about things that you had not even considered before. Unless you're one of those who believes that ignorance is bliss, the small price you pay for owning this dvd is worth the knowledge and insight it offers in return.",1225324800,28,987,4.634285714285714
3421197,5,B0018TN72U,"I had seen the History Channel's offering on this subject, and found, while it was informative, it still left much to ponder. This was somewhat better as it covered much of what was likely to happen if things were left running. It did make a salient point. It showed how the environment is affected.",1224115200,6,299,4.555555555555555
3421198,5,B0018TN72U,"Aftermath: Population Zero (National Geographic Channel)
is similar to
Life After People(History Channel)

Although 'AfterMath: Population Zero' is basically the same thing as Life After People, Aftermath is presented MUCH better.

'AfterMath: Population Zero' had realistic animals instead of the complete CGI that 'Life After People' had.

I thought both were fascinating, just that Aftermath was done better.

3421202,4,B0018TN72U,"I if up hve t seen the above series then u would be thralled, but havg seen the series it lacked re me. But on the whole a very interests insight to what the world will become wthout people polluting n changing the rivers n waterways. Earth goes back t how it was before man came along",1389052800,,285,4.017543859649122
3421203,5,B0018TN72U,Very intense and interesting.  Very well thought out and filmed.  Scary!  I also love the narrator's voice. National Geographic rocks!,1381190400,2,134,5.6
3421204,3,B0018TN72U,"The photography was wonderful, except for reliance on a time lapse clouds in/clouds out sequence for filler.  My interest was in ""how long will it take to erase the presence of humans"" so the dramatic play of the first part of the process was not as ""chilling"" as it was meant to be (but just for me).  The way they showed the decay of buildings was interesting.  Overall, I'd buy it again, and I'll watch it again too.",1358812800,3,419,4.346153846153846
3421205,3,B0018TN72U,"This isn't a serious documentary about the decline and fall of humanity, but rather a bizarre form of entertainment. ""Aftermath: Population Zero"" asks the hypothetical question what would happen if all humans the world over would disappear in the blink of an eye. This Rapture-like scenario isn't very likely to happen, of course. It's science fiction, but a kind of science fiction so seemingly close to reality to give the impression of a ""documentary"".

Dogs roam abandoned suburbs, preying on each other. Eventually, they interbreed with wolves and become the most successful predators of the new world. Lions, camels and elephants leave the zoos when the electric fences go off line. Dairy cows die like flies, and so do cockroaches - they can't stand the cold weather in the northern hemisphere when the central heating is turned off. Mice take over the crumbling cities (all food is still left). Bison once again roam the West, while southern California and Las Vegas are turned into empty desert. Aiplanes and satellites crash all over the world, nuclear power plants explode and severely contaminate the state of Illinois, and the Hoover dam bursts when the mighty Colorado River reclaims its rightful place among the nations... Or was it rivers?

Two centuries ""A.H."" (After Humanity), the Eiffel tower and the Statue of Liberty collapse, but kitchen sinks made of stainless steel are still littering an ex-urban landscape terrorized by dog-wolf hybrids. 25,000 years A.H. a new Ice Age finally wipes out all traces of human presence at the northern hemisphere, but the narrator claims that our artefacts on the Moon can last much longer, since the lunar landscape changes very slowly. Ironically, evidence for our existence will thus be preserved...outside the Earth. Somehow, I doubt it. Surely, a meteorite can take care of our lunar vehicles?

I can't say that ""Aftermath"" thrilled me. Sure, it's well-done and even contains a few humorous moments, as when a pack of Great Danes try to take down an escaped zoo elephant (they fail). However, this program tells us very little about how humanity might actually decline and disappear. If it happens fast, as in the event of truly catastrophic climate change or an asteroid impact, the rest of nature will go down the drain together with us - no food left for the mice at your local convenience store. If it happens more slowly, on the other hand, the nuclear power plants, airplanes or satellites will presumably be taken off line in more gradual and ""orderly"" fashion. The most realistic part of ""Aftermath"" is the crumbling and collapse of the major cities. That, of course, would happen if humans would be forced to eventually abandon them. Goodbye, Manhattan Skyline.

I'm not sure how to rate ""Aftermath: Population Zero"" but since it's well-produced (and presented by a narrator with a spooky voice), I give it three stars.",1356912000,,2891,5.029227557411273
3421206,2,B0018TN72U,"I find the premise very interesting, but a boring 2 hour program could have been an exciting one hour program if the narration wasn't so slow and repetitive to fill more time. He must have mentioned each fact 3 times in slighly different wording, extremely frustrating. This would make something decent to watch in the background while you do chores, but it is pretty painful to sit through for two hours straight.",1325376000,4,414,4.763888888888889
3421207,2,B0018TN72U,"I'm keeping this review short.  The subject matter discussed here is very interesting, and some of the recreation scenes are cool (like Paris and London in 1000 years), but I felt too much time was wasted on silly subjects.  The problem with this show was it felt compelled to include this idea of what the world would look like if we suddenly vanished, as if in some sort of rapture.  Too much time was wasted on the fate of cars left running and planes in the air.  Even more pointless time is spent on the fate of our cats and dogs.

On the polar end, I felt too little time was spent on explaining how and why things would break down.  The book ""The World Without Us"" did a fantastic job detailing specifics, like the fate of NYC.  I liked this because it gives you an intimate detailing of what happens to a city when left unattended.  Instead, this program decided to focus on subjects like what would happen to the Statue of Liberty.  That's great, but what about the rest of the city?

Overall, too much time is spent on things that don't really matter.  Forget the visuals and read the book.",1295308800,2,1100,4.369458128078818
3421208,3,B0018TN72U,"This National Geographic show is very good, and perhaps if the LIFE AFTER PEOPLE movie and TV series on the History Channel did not exist, then this would get a higher rating.......  but LIFE AFTER EARTH has a much better presentation with more detailed technical facts , better time lapse graphics and presenting a timeline.",1272672000,5,325,4.909090909090909
3421209,3,B0018TN72U,"Anyone that has ever watched the Resident Evil movies will get a feeling of deja vu while watching this.  No, there are no zombies walking the earth, but the aftermath in the beginning looks very much like the end of Resident Evil one with cars crashed and on fire, a major smog over the cities, and trains derailed.  Sixty years after humans, the scenery is much like that in Resident Evil: Apocolypse with buildings falling apart, no electricty, and no agriculture.

I found this educational as far as what will happen with nuclear power plants, zoo animals running around (the reason for my title up there is that the camels and birds seemed the least affected by the loss of humans), and how 25000 pieces of ""space junk"" will come crashing down like meteors.  Interesting!

What I didn't like and what brings it down to a three star rating is the show seems to drive one point home over and over again.  Our pet dogs will starve to death and die.  I got the point way before they showed a pack of big dogs attacking a toy breed on the streets.  I didn't need the nail driven that far into my head.

Something I found a bit funny tho is when the show says dogs and wolves will breed and in the process make a bunch of dingoes. LOL.  Sorry, but I couldn't help it.  I'm not saying it is not possible, but I did chuckle.  (All the more reason to spay and neuter!)",1260230400,7,1364,4.326771653543307
3421210,1,B0018TN72U,"It's not the same as life after people. The message is far more deliberate and scolding. It's interesting to the point that all of our stuff would disintegrate over time and imagining and seeing the earth devolving back to the ice age (thats a spoiler, folks). The films theme is constant and over the two hours, annoying. Nature, it seems, in the eyes of the films creators, does not include humans. Humans are conquerors; vain, monument building prison wardens of the world, and ""Nature"" is held captive by us. Once we disappear, ""Nature"" is freed to ""reclaim"" what is rightfully theirs. Humans are not considered part of nature. The narrator constantly refers to Nature, either without acknowledging, or outright criticizing our natural right of existence. Nothing, it would seem, in human history has done anything good nor worthy of continued presence on the planet, and all is right with the world once we are gone. According to these nuts, every fish, animal, insect or plant flourishes once we pesky humans are gone.",1259712000,9,1024,4.959302325581396

8271067,4,B0018TN72U,"With the use of CGI this shares a demonstration of what is thought would probably occur if humanity were to suddenly disappear (for reasons unknown: Rapture? 'Independence Day' 'War of the Worlds'. Cars wreck, airplanes crash/fall out of the sky. Gives minute by minute, then hour by hour. Soon days at a time as emergency back-up plans run out of fuel. Dams break, animals get out of zoos, pets go into the wild.

As time passes weather causes man's creations to break down and eventually nature takes back everything. Monuments in well-known cities are shown going to pieces. Interesting.",1465516800,,590,4.959595959595959
