I'm positively spellbound with all the techniques and tips I've learned from this DVD.  From how to bake polymer clay without an oven (!) to how to make faux dichroic glass for jewelry, Tim covers all the world of distressed artwork and MORE.  He's easy to watch, fun to listen to, and he knows his stuff.  The gallery is to die for and the bloopers are hilarious!  If you have seen number one, you will want number two; but if you haven't seen any of Tim's work, get this DVD and be prepared to clear off some space and go play when you are done! WOW!",1142380800,21,716,4.353383458646617
2521886,5,B000ELJ3HG,"Tim Holtz does it again!  This new creative journey that Tim Holtz takes the viewer on is one that should not be missed.  His artistic ability shines on this DVD.  All the projects are stepped out beautifully and his fun and playfulness with each medium will draw you in.  Tim's journey focuses on the hot rage of altered art, but he shows the viewer, through fabulous gallery works, how each of the techniques can be applied to any artistic endeavor.  The quality of this DVD - sound, navigation, camera angles - is unmatched in the industry.  Buy this DVD first, but be sure to check out the other PageSage titles, you will not be disappointed with any of them.  Tim's magical journey has begun again....Get on Board!!!!",1142208000,9,722,4.637795275590551

I wondered how any DVD could match Tim Holtz's first PageSage DVD ""An Altered Journey"". Well this one does! It is over two and half hours of ideas and techniques that are creative, innovative, and inspiring.

You don't need to have watched the first DVD to appreciate this one. In addition, compared to his first DVD, this one has more information about his materials and usage. Both DVDs complement each other. The first gave me ideas and the second helped me to understand so much more.

The DVD includes new ideas for distressing, distressing with embossing powders, melting pot distressing, creating custom molds, glazed mosaics made with shrink wrap, creating custom stamp pads for custom correspondence, creating the look of dichroic glass using embossing powders, and encaustic collage with beeswax. It also includes many, many more ideas for using alcohol inks!

Some ideas were more esoteric and required some expensive supplies, but they were still inspirational, like fireless raku.

Like other PageSage DVDs, there is a great gallery feature that includes comments on the projects and shows variations. Extras include tips from projects (this is a compilation of all the tips from all the projects arranged in an index-like fashion---cool!), hilarious bloopers, and all sources for supplies.

What a value for the money, a fantastic class that can and will be watched over and over and over again!

Highly recommended.

2521890,4,B000ELJ3HG,"Hi,
My wife loved them unfortunately, she wished they were subtitled in French.
I speak english, I could translate most of the projects easily but whenever she needs to watch them on her own,then she has difficulties even if the images show most of the activities breakdown.
Still she did really enjoyed them very much.
Thanks Tim",1223683200,,330,4.807017543859649

Just as well as he did in the first DVD, Tim Holtz takes us thru a lot of cool projects and techniques in his own style.  Beeing a stamper for 9 years myself, I was thrilled to see how he used products I love in new and exciting ways.  He presents it s well, so even for us that have english as our native tounge, it's no problem to follow his instruction, and all the projects would work great for both experienced and not so experienced ""artist"".  I would highly recommend everybody to use this opportunity for this one-on-one class with Tim Holtz in their own home.",1143072000,10,683,4.338582677165355
