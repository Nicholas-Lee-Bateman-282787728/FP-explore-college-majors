3700641,4,B001MVWRNO,"There is great character development since the previous season.  It's full of thrills, chills, and action.  In some ways it across as an action soap opera.  Marshall is the brief comic relief amidst the chaos and drama.",1449532800,,219,4.864864864864865

3700644,1,B001MVWRNO,"This may sound odd and since I can't find another case of it on Google I am sure it is odd. I used to watch Alias off and on back in the day when it was the only good thing on that night and I enjoyed it. Well I started working my way through the series on DvD watching every episode in order and while I know it is not to everyone's taste I am enjoying it quite a bit. To me it feels like a rebirth of the more over the top episodes of The Avengers and The Saint crossed with the Roger Moore Bond films and I like that, there is just one problem. I can't find a single copy of the season two DvD that will play on any of my DvD players. I know this sounds strange but for the past two years I have bought the season three times and gotten it five different copies out of the library and none of them will even be read as a DvD.

I have tried them on every DvD and blu ray player I have at home, I have tried them on players at a friend's house, I have tried them on the four different drives with six different media players on three different computers. I even went so far as to spend two days tracking down a really old version of a media player I had never heard of that's logo was on the back of the case and downloading it and even that will not read these discs that have no marks of any kind on them as DvDs. it doesn't just say the disc can not be read, the players all insist that there are no discs in the drive and I have tried getting my money back but no such luck since I spent so mush time trying to get the discs to work. They will not even be read as discs by the disc ripping programs I have that are so good I use them to make back up copies of Bluray discs from other regions. After paying for this season three times I feel like I have a right to see it and not just skip ahead to season three, even if it is the worst season of any tv show ever.

I know this may sound like a strange request given that the show is so old and I know it is not that popular but after two years I really want to see season two and my below dial up internet speed at home is to slow to download this off of Amazon video(It just stalls out after a while) these discs will not even work on old DvD players that were made the same years as the discs or my old PS2 or Xbox.

If anyone out there knows how I can get a working copy of Alias season 2 on DvD, please help. I have been trying to watch this show in order for so long and it has gotten to the point where it is personal and I just can't bring myself to give up and move on. If you know where a working DvD can be found I would be grateful, thanks a bunch for reading this post.

Just to be clear I have tried these discs in every player I have ever owned and I have owned all of the major brands, not to mention the DvD players on several different PCs along with several different Xboxes, Xbox 360s, and PS2s.  I have never had any problems with any other ABC DvDs.  Also if something has the official DvD stamp on it(And all the sets I tried did)then it is supposed to work in an any DvD player with that stamp on it.

However I recently got another copy of this and it played fine, so it seems there was just a bad batch of discs out there that I kept running into.  I am sorry to report that this set looked exactly the same as the other sets I have owned so I have no idea how you would tell a good set from a bad set.  Buyer beware.

Without the bad discs I would give this set four stars for it's episodes as they are really good and a lot of fun to watch.  It's just a shame it took me so long to watch it.",1447200000,,3573,3.788978494623656

3700660,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias offers reliable J.J. Abrams spy fun with a great cast of regulars. It's mostly silly fun. Victor Garber is the dad I aspire to be (except for the whole turning my five-year-old daughter into trained killer thing). In other words, he's a jerk who will nonetheless kill anyone he thinks is a threat to his daughter. (I think that's how daughters see their fathers at a certain age.) Jennifer Garner is appealing and athletic, and sports new hair and wardrobe in every episode. (Although they never explained why bad guys always choose bars as their headquarters.) Ron Rifkin is just creepy as the head of SD6. I could list every other cast member and not come up with a weak member. We churned through all the seasons over the course of a few weeks and were sorry when they were done.",1438819200,,788,4.556338028169014

3700664,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias in general I give rave reviews.  The production team for this season did an outstanding job. Cannot complain.  Lena Olen was added to the series in this season and portrayed Jennifer Garner's mother.  Lena was brought back later in the series, mainly the final series (season 5).",1435276800,,285,4.895833333333333

3700674,4,B001MVWRNO,"I loved Alias up to the third season, after that, no comment :) So the 2nd season was just brilliant. I loved the interactions between Sydney Bristo and her cold father, I loved the missions, the music was top-notch and the fighting was superb. The story held a lot of interest still and we binged on this second season when we watched it. You have to start watching with the first series, and you have to set aside at least 3 hours if you are going to get a good dose of ALIAS in you. Enjoy! It was a very good show up until the end. I hope this helps you decide if to watch it.",1426550400,,579,4.0

3700686,5,B001MVWRNO,"I personally think Alias Season 2 is the best season.  It is action packed and so much happens in this season.  This whole TV show is incredible!  If you have watched one season, you will want to keep watching until it ends (yes it is that good)!  :)",1404172800,,250,4.145833333333333

3700689,5,B001MVWRNO,Love Alias! Loved it then & now. I wish they'd start all over surely it's been enough events to write about & create some juicy spy stuff! I love the whole cast & can't get enough! Just order season 5 which is the last & I will continue watching them over & over! Luv u Alias!,1397347200,,276,3.9464285714285716
3700690,5,B001MVWRNO,"Jennifer Garner, Michael Varten, Lena Olin, Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, Kevin Weissman, and Merrin Dungey were the heart and soul and this show!! To this day this is the best JJ Abrams has done in a drama series!!!",1394409600,,242,4.785714285714286

3700692,3,B001MVWRNO,"The difference from season 1 to season 2 is significant. The show's quality dips a bit from its intricate and well acted scripts to slightly more accessibility.

The fight seasons, are at times, laughably bad. They follow the same formula (Sydney gets hit and falls into something, and then picks up something handy and smashes it across someones skull ending the fight) or the spinning kicks that never seem to back fire.

Her relationship with Vaughn also appears to be a bit overdone in an effort to make the show a bit more accessible to people who didn't watch season 1.",1393632000,,575,4.683168316831683
3700693,5,B001MVWRNO,"I enjoyed the original telecast so this DVD allowed me to re-visit my first time entertainment.  The DVD quality is very good as well.

3700695,5,B001MVWRNO,Many nights we had to look at just one more episode and lost sleep because it was never just one more. The last episode of season 5 was such a twister we watched the entire season non stop. It was unusual for me and my husband  to enjoy a series this much.,1391299200,,256,3.923076923076923
3700696,5,B001MVWRNO,I love this series it is so full of action thanks a lot. I wish I could find more at this great price.,1390867200,,102,3.4782608695652173
3700697,1,B001MVWRNO,"So my husband and I are watching this series on Netflix (which is easy, next episode is already queued up, unlike here you have to search for it). But I wanted to rewatch some episodes without messing up our playlist so I'm watching them here. Halfway through, they are gone from Prime. Really? $2.99 an episode when it's on Netflix? What are you thinking? Same thing happened to us a year ago with Ice Road Truckers. Why wouldn't we just stick with Netflix where this never happens?",1390348800,,483,4.563218390804598

3700701,3,B001MVWRNO,This show is awesome. I'm rating it 3 stars because of Amazon. I was halfway through the season and Amazon removed it from prime. I guess I should just cancel Prime and go back to Netflix where I can get it and much more. Not a smart business decision when you're trying to compete with Netflix.

3700702,4,B001MVWRNO,If you like conspiracy scenarios and a heroine with supporting teams to help her it is great.  The only draw back is they keep not taking the shot when they could kill the bad guy in season.  It was time for a new one.  Maybe on the next season they will get rid of Sloan.,1389571200,,272,3.909090909090909

3700704,5,B001MVWRNO,"My husband and I are really enjoying Alias. The second season is even better than the first. Yes, it's a glamorous Hollywood view of spying and sometimes very unrealistic, but it's grossly entertaining and the characters are great!",1389398400,,231,5.105263157894737

3700706,5,B001MVWRNO,"Why is she always wearing heals even in the most absolutely impractical and inappropriate situations, sometimes despite being fully capable of dressing herself like a professional (and an adult)  before hand. Sometimes it's forgivable. She was in disguise and had to do with what she had. Pumps on an ambush? Really?I like that took them off in one episode of the first season, but now, it's a recurring thing. They have billions of dollars in R&D but they can't give her collapsible heels, or even a pair of trainers that she can slip on when thing go bad. Which, by the way, (SURPRISE) they always do. Maybe it's be she does stupid things like sneak around in restricted areas with FOUR INCH BLOODY HEELS.

Forgive my rant. The show is very well paced and it doesn't pull of too many of the cliches I've come to expect from spy dramas. But god damn, her wearing heals all the time keeps reminding me that this plot can be very unrealistic, and it's very distracting.",1389139200,,968,4.589595375722543

3700709,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias content,character's,and delivery is another great creation by J J Abrams.

3700715,5,B001MVWRNO,"I miss this series so much. It's my go to show ""WHEN"" my kids haven't stolen my Kindle. Love Prime too, as it's allowed me to go back and watch Alias from the beginning.",1386979200,,169,4.0
3700716,5,B001MVWRNO,"Perfect series, evolving interesting, action packed!  JJ Abrahams at his best, they could bring this whole series to the big screen like mission impossible",1386979200,,155,5.458333333333333
3700717,4,B001MVWRNO,The show was good.  The streaming was very good.  I am enjoying the prime movies and all that goes with it.,1386547200,,107,4.0476190476190474
3700718,5,B001MVWRNO,"I have never seen a series as good as this one. It is action packed, a common thread runs through it so you are anxious to see the next program.  The love interest between Sidney and Vaughn seems real and you feel for them.  Their adventures keep you at the tip of your seat and you always want more.  If you haven't seen this series yet give it a chance you won't be able to stop at just one show.",1384819200,,398,3.95
3700719,5,B001MVWRNO,"Love this show--it's absolutely fantastic. the writing is still good--watch out for seasons 4 and 5 where it switches up on you, but seasons 1-3 are so much fun and great suspense:)",1383177600,,181,4.6875
3700720,3,B001MVWRNO,"It is a series that you just keep watching because you can!  I watched Alias years ago (10+?) when it was a sitcom and then ""lost"" it somewhere in time.  It is addictive to watch these because you can literally watch one after another and before you know it you've watched 3 or 4.  While it is fun to do this, I would have to say as a critic some of the plots are a little bit of a stretch and it seems that the CIA (or SD6 once) have only a couple of agents and it's always Sidney Bristow in any mix.  Certainly helped catapult Jennifer Garner right into stardom.  Good for her.  It is just something easy to watch and it is always predictable that Bristow, Vaughn and others will always get out of all of those incredibly tight situations and although they appear to have sustained injuries (and some very serious) they look terrific afterwards!  Nice.  It's also fun to see what the costume designer will put Sidney in.  I think she could compete with any Mission Impossible plot! and look just as good.  For anyone just wanting easy entertainment, sure I would recommend this.
Ditto for Season 3 and beyond.",1383091200,,1111,4.401960784313726

3700723,5,B001MVWRNO,"Great show!  No bedroom scenes, no vulgarity, just honest to goodness action!  Yes, there is a little love story going on but it is just enough and not over the top....ever!  Can watch it with family and no one has any objections...not even me!  Enjoy!",1382054400,,252,4.533333333333333
3700724,4,B001MVWRNO,Interesting plot line with lots of twists.  Amazon prime is awesome as I wouldn't have ever seen this show since I missed all the broadcasts,1382054400,,140,4.6
3700725,5,B001MVWRNO,This is a really good show.  I never watched it when it came out so it's new to me.  I recommend this show to anyone who likes action and suspense. It has plenty of both.,1381449600,,170,3.8285714285714287
3700726,4,B001MVWRNO,"If you're board with TV and looking for a good series to watch, this is a great choice. Decent storyline, good characters. We haven't watched this since it aired on TV over 10 years ago. It is still entertaining to watch as we have forgotten most of what happened. Good momentum.",1381190400,,279,4.490196078431373

3700728,4,B001MVWRNO,"This is an entertaining series which we missed completely when it was running years ago. They changed the intro this season and that was an improvement. Other than that, we enjoy keeping up with the exploits (however improbable) of the cast of characters.",1381104000,,255,4.953488372093023
3700729,5,B001MVWRNO,"This series requires a bit of time before the viewer understands that it shouldn't be taken seriously.  I struggled in the beginning with the implausibility of several elements, more so than with other shows of this type (James Bond movies, etc.).  Once I realized that the main characters were invulnerable, I relaxed and settled in.  This series can be enjoyed just for the absurd dangers and stupendous escapes and can be a hoot if one approaches it from a purely entertainment perspective.  Some of the ""person in danger"" sequences are fairly graphic and there are several scenes of prisoner torture, injection with one or more chemical substances, tooth extractions, etc. so the squeamish should close their eyes and wait for good to triumph, which it soon does.  Each episode seems end with mini (sometimes maxi) cliff-hangers, so I kept on watching.  Great entertainment.",1380758400,,878,5.104895104895105

3700733,4,B001MVWRNO,"I enjoy shows and films of this genre. I never was able to watch it when it was on tv, but I think it's an entertaining show. One thing to keep in mind is that it's just a show so there are some things you have to accept with regard to some aspects not being realistic at all. For example, a confined location and a hail storm of bullets adds some suspense and excitement, but the scenes are not realistic at all.",1379462400,,413,4.048780487804878
3700734,5,B001MVWRNO,I give this season two thumbs up!!! Sydney Bristow is on kick butt character and her supporting cast is just as great! This season is filled with suspense and lots of action!,1379462400,,174,4.46875

3700739,5,B001MVWRNO,"It is a little different heading than expected from first season, but still a good plot, Worth the time to watch.",1379030400,,113,4.428571428571429
3700740,5,B001MVWRNO,"Jennifer Garner at her best, however, I haven't been impressed with her work elsewhere to be honest, but Alias is really good series, and the second season is exceptional.",1378944000,,171,4.931034482758621
3700741,5,B001MVWRNO,"Still one of my favorite shows! Great storyline and characters and Jennifer Garner makes an awesome spy-next-door!

3700748,3,B001MVWRNO,I watch this show in the background while doing other things on my computer. The plot is complex enough to be somewhat interesting while not demanding your attention every second. I'll probably end up watching the whole series and then moving on to something else.,1377216000,,264,4.888888888888889

And so-far I am also enjoying Season 3!
However, I watched a portion of Season 4, and it has not seemed to me to be quite as interesting.
If you enjoy well-crafted high-class spy shows, than Alias may be right for you!
And certainly, it couldn't hurt to try.
I started watching Alias on YouTube, and have now been watching Seasons 2-3 on Amazon Prime.
Anyhow, thanks so much for taking time to read my comment!

Every episode is written well enough that it could be a stand alone episode, but they also fit extremely well into the overall story arc.

Music in the DVD version was replaced with something generic.  I bought episode 21 in season 2 called The Second Double to see if the original soundtrack was in tact on the purchased digital copy.  It was not.  I was really disappointed.  The change in music completely waters down the scene, it 's amazing what a difference it makes.  It's a shame that with as much loving attention to detail as was put into this show, people won't get to hear the original soundtrack without reverting to DVD format.",1367971200,,640,4.578947368421052
3700798,4,B001MVWRNO,"We're about half a year into Amazon Prime and have come to appreciate the ability to watch a series in it's intended order, starting with the original. Alias is the 3rd we've gotten into. We're on episode 5 of Season 2 and it hasn't lost a beat from Season 1.
In some ways I can't explain why I am still into this series, but I am. There is no way any of this can happen. Jennifer Garner is attractive and intelligent and physically fit, but she gets into situations weekly that would leave a mere mortal 'extinct' after an episode or two. I guess this fits into the guilty pleasure category - sure it is not realistic, but it is creative and entertaining and there is enough going on with side stories to make you want to watch on.
Start at the 1st, and watch 2 or 3, if that doesn't do it, this show isn't for you. You might be surprised!",1367625600,,840,4.191358024691358

When we were kids in the 40s and 50s comics provided our escape from reality. Then came TV...at first it was family stuff, but as it evolved it grew and grew and grew some more until now there are so many options it's hard to decide. Alias is a great example of the new adventure genre which combines heroes, heroines, conspiracy and wow gadgets and scenarios. Each episode leaves you wondering who is really who and what is really what. Lots of excitement and with 4 more seasons to go what else can they possibly dream up?? Once you start, you're hooked.

The X-Files, Babylon 5, and Heroes are on deck.  So I tried Alias, not exactly SciFi, but with the amazing stunts, and baffling use of technology, it is almost ScifI.  So far I like, don't love it, as they tend to go overboard at times,  hey ....

Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a double agent working for the CIA as a mole in the terrorist organization SD-6 which passes itself off as an authentic CIA division to its deceived agents. The head of the agency is Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), a heartless assassin who will go to any lengths to achieve greatness in the Alliance, an elite terrorist operation based in central Europe... even if it means killing his own wife. He wants a seat with the Alliance and will purchase it at any cost. Working against him is his most trusted business associate and friend Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), also a double agent recruited to SD-6 during the Cold War. Through their covert missions to bring down the Alliance, Jack's relationship with his daughter Sydney has been improving by leaps and bounds. But dark secrets still stand between them.

Sydney has completed her mission to recover her friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and destroy the Rombaldi artifact the Alliance hopes to use as a weapon of mass destruction. She and her handler Agent Vaughn (Michael Vartan) were separated when the building flooded and Sydney fears he may be dead. But she has more pressing problems. Captured and detained by Russian emissaries, she is horrified to learn her mother Irina Derevko (Lena Olin) is in charge of the operation. A member of the former Soviet Union sent to the US to infiltrate and betray the CIA, Irina married Jack Bristow and then faked her own death to fool the government... but not until after murdering twelve of the CIA's top agents. Sydney manages to escape but is forced to abandon Vaughn for dead. Will is also in for rough waters when he must discredit himself to avoid being killed by SD-6, since an editorial he wrote about the undercover agency was printed after his disappearance.

Arrested for heroin abuse, Will loses his job as a reporter and is forced to undergo recovery therapy. While undercover in France, Sydney discovers Vaughn in the basement of a private residence and smuggles him back to the agency. After speaking at Emily Sloane's funeral, Sydney receives shocking news. Irina Derevko has turned herself in to the government, offering to share information in return for a lighter sentence. Jack doesn't trust her but Sydney is enthralled with her mother and eventually begins to be drawn into her web. A series of covert missions leads Sydney into the heart of danger, manipulation, and even romance. At SD-6, things are also heating up. Sloane believes his wife may still be alive. Someone is stalking him, leaving poison-laced wine in his house, cutting security wires, and signing in under Emily's name at their favorite hotel. This could threaten his relationship with the Alliance and make everyone at SD-6 a target.

The first season of Alias proved an emotional roller coaster of excitement, never breaking its momentum even at the heart-stopping finale. If possible, the second season is even better, bringing in more of everything we loved the first time around and throwing wrenches in the emotional works as we deal with various unanticipated surprises. Even the villains get moments in which the audience feels a form of empathy toward them. Sloane is one of the most brilliant nemesis ever created. Entwined with the high-tech equipment and spying missions is a futuristic sci-fi theme tied to the artifacts of a 15th century prophet. These objects may be part of Armageddon if they fall into the wrong hands. Though morally flawed, each and every character has a drawing point. Sydney and her emotional struggle between work and her family. Michael as he deals with loving her but being unable to express himself. Sydney's clueless coworkers at SD-6, her intelligent but dangerous father, even the CIA's therapist has a few quirks.

Sexual content is about level with the original season and is more teasing than graphic. Sydney is shown being de-toxified by agents (apparently nude with her arms crossed over her breasts). She and Vaughn do eventually sleep together; they do some making out before the episode ends. (Close-up kissing leads into a far-off shot of them fooling around on a bed through a camera concealed in the television in her room.) The next episode opens with them laying side by side in bed. Unfortunately many later episodes show portions of this scene as a flashback (""last time on Alias...""). Episode 21 opens with them stripping; the camera pans out after they're partially undressed. In the same episode Sydney and Michael infiltrate a ""sex club,"" and she lures a man into a back room by pretending to be a S&M girl. She ties him up stripped down to his boxers and smacks him with a whip a few times before revealing the setup. She also goes undercover as a hooker; she slinks out in alternating red and black lingerie and makes a come-on to her client, only to turn on him and knock him unconscious.

Many of her outfits are cleavage-bearing, short, tight, and immodest. We see women in their bras as they change clothes (Sydney takes off her jacket in an airport to show off a leather bra as she walks through the security scanner). She's seen partially taking off a bikini in order to lure a terrorist. None of the characters are married but all have intimate standings. Will and Francine kiss and are shown sleeping in the same bed. Michael is thrilled because Sydney offers him the middle drawer one evening while they're hanging out in her bedroom. He wakes up beside her numerous times. Still-married Jack and Irina kiss on one of their missions and probably sleep together (it has a surprising twist). A female coworker asks Marshall if he's gay. Sydney asks Francine if she's slept with Will yet. On their first date Michael asks Sydney if she wants to take advantage of a room key. She agrees but they're nearly killed in a crossfire and the date's off. Sloane is seen several times with his shirt off.

Language isn't a major problem, but many uses of ""hell,"" ""son of a ..."" and several a** are thrown around. Sydney is called a ""b*tch"" in one episode. There's a great deal of punching, kicking, and other combat. People are mowed down with machine guns and shot at point-blank range with occasionally bloody results. Prisoners are tortured and mistreated. Often morphine is withheld in order to make them talk. Injections are graphically given to both good and bad guys. Sloane has a tracking device shot into the back of his neck. A box is opened to discover a severed ring finger. There are references to murder, poisoning, and other graphic forms of violent torture (a man is electrocuted, another threatened with ingesting broken glass). A woman beats a man over the head, knocking him unconscious. People are shot with tranquilizer darts. A virus has gruesome results, causing bleeding from the victims' fingertips. Characters show up with bruises, scrapes, and bloodstained arm bands after combat. A man is knocked into a propeller; others are sucked into airplane holdings, causing the wings to explode.

The final episode's showdown gets brutal between two women as they fight it out in an apartment, throwing each other over counters and through glass doors. One of them is shot several times with bloody results. Bodies with bullet wounds and slashed throats are found. A bloodstained bed has a gruesome glimpse of a body with its heart taken out. The CIA (and one private individual) often use a mild form of hypnosis in order to force people to remember previous events. They're usually seen in or coming out of this trance. For lovers of James Bond-esque adventures with plenty of action, dangerous missions, enough humor to elevate teeth-clenching torture scenes, and lots of wonderful aliases, the show is a good bet. The largest disappointment is its reliance on premarital sex and the concept ""everybody does it."" The series loses much of its romantic tension after the leads become intimate. There's no longer the wonderful ""Will they get together?"" question mark hanging over their heads. In this case, writers may have done themselves a disservice by rushing the romance along.",1363824000,,8128,4.9104803493449785

3700893,5,B001MVWRNO,"In my experience Season 2 seems to be the most popular and beloved season of the show among fans and critics alike and it's a hard belief to argue against, though for me personally it's roughly tied for that honor with Season 3, which sadly most seem to regard as the start of the downward spiral of the show. Season 2 features each of the two most popular, highly-regarded shows of the series by mainstream fans- the mid-season turning-point episode ""Phase One,"" which was the post-Super Bowl episode and the season finale, ""The Telling."" Both of these are masterful hours of television for the most part though the first 10 minutes or so of Phase One crosses the line of what I'm willing to see on network television. I thought ABC played a huge part in the show not being that big of a hit by making the entire series appear to be nothing more than Jennifer Garner running around in very little despite the show being probably the most intelligent on the networks at the time. This was the biggest reason I didn't start watching the show until I got hooked on TNT late night reruns just a few months before the final two episodes of the series in 2006. The first act of Phase One can't be blamed on ABC portraying the show wrongly (though they did make their promo for this episode feature the first act almost exclusively as I recall), that one is on the producers and, as epic and important an episode as it it, they held it back a bit in my mind and turned a lot of potential new fans of the show off with that stunt and by post-Super Bowl standards the ratings for this episode were very poor. For the most part I'd say Alias is just a bit more family-friendly, for lack of a better term, and certainly a whole lot more intelligent and developed than the ABC promos ever suggested, Phase One starts off as a very adult-oriented and shallow episode though before catching fire and becoming one of the great episodes of the series.

This season has a ton of very good, very popular episodes after the top two as well. As you get closer to Phase One you may notice Jack and/or Sydney are going on CIA missions frequently while they're still working with SD6, who throughout season 1 summoned them constantly at all random times, and that pushes my suspension of disbelief a bit- especially upon repeated viewings. I took this as a sign that, as beloved as the dual double agents story line was, it was running out of steam and needed to be changed. Still, the drama in this season is fantastic, both before and after Phase One. I'd say Season 2 is the definitive season of the show without question. If you asked every fan you could find to think of a single scene, episode, or arc from any part of the series that really stuck with them I'd guarantee you'd get more answers from this season than any other and it wouldn't be close.",1340236800,,2836,4.432950191570881

3700896,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias Season 2 is the best season of television ever. The DVD set is great. Definitely worth the buy, even if it's a blind buy!",1329264000,,127,4.12
3700897,4,B001MVWRNO,"Alias initially appeared on TV at a time when ABC was noticing a decline in viewership. Prior to the release of Alias, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which had previously been ABC's cash cow, was in decline and ABC had relied too heavily on its popularity. As a result they dropped from their coveted spot of being the most watched network on television. Of course, this could easily have been due to oversaturation as the show played three nights a week and other networks tried to repeat the success causing viewers to tire of game shows. As a result ABC started refocusing on scripted dramas in an effort to regain their place at the top of network television.

While ABC had shows like The Practice, The Drew Carey Show, and Spin City that pulled in moderate ratings they needed something more to boost them back up to their previous standard. JJ Abrams had created a bonafide hit for the WB Television Network with the premier of Felicity. With the first season of Alias he created one of the few ABC shows at the time with near universal critical acclaim. On top of that it garnered fairly decent viewership in the coveted 18-49 demographic and over the first season it averaged 9.7 million viewers. Naturally this led to ABC green-lighting a second season of the show.

***If you have not seen season 1 of Alias, and don't like spoilers, I recommend that you stop reading now***

Sydney (Jennifer Garner) and her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) continue their crusade against SD-6 and its leader Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin). They find an unlucky ally when Sydney's presumed dead former KGB agent mother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), turns herself in to the CIA offering to help. Meanwhile, Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) now knows the truth of Sydney and Jack's affiliation with SD-6 and the CIA and must claim that he was the victim of a drug addiction that caused him to make up all the information about SD-6 in order to keep his life. However, he finds a little solace in helping Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) in his research, but even that may put his life at risk.

Abrams and his writers really up the ante on the second season of Alias. With the addition of Lena Olin's Derevko and more details about the Alliance of 12 we get more suspense. Derevko's allegiances are never really known to the audience, even when it seems that she may have betrayed her daughter and the CIA. Sloan is fleshed out more than he was previously as we begin to learn more of his motivations and the truth of exactly what he may (or may not) know about what's going on around him. The crew once again does a great job focusing more on characters and relationships and not overpowering the series with gadgets as most spy shows would do. We get quite a bit more of the mythology behind Milo Rambaldi, but even the lore of the Renaissance-era inventor doesn't take precedence over the characters.

Throughout the second season many of the characters, and the actors who portray them, get more of an opportunity to show off their skills where they didn't really get an opportunity to previously. Kevin Weisman's Marshall Flinkman, usually the comedic anchor of the show as SD-6's tech guy, gets the opportunity to go on a mission and participate in a little bit of an action. His part in the season is largely expanded allowing more of a chance to shine in the series. Carl Lumbly, as Marcus Dixon, also gets the opportunity to delve deeper into the emotional core of his character showing that he is more than just a device to drive forward the plot. Merrin Dungey, who plays Sydney's best friend Francie, also has the opportunity to join in the fun of the spy world, but for more on that you have to watch the series.

I really enjoyed the second season of this series, although I lamented the fact that we spent much more time in the spy world than we did in season one. Where in season one we had the opportunity to watch Sydney juggle her home life and college career with her work as a spy, in the second season a large part of that is missing as Francie is now the only member of her inner circle that doesn't know her secret and her college career is all but missing (with the exception of a shot of Sydney in her graduation gown). All in all though this is an exciting action packed second season that almost lives up to the first season.

4/5

3700900,3,B001MVWRNO,"3 1/2 Stars. This was a fun, bubble-gum pop kind of a show in its day. I was a fan when it first aired, largely because it featured some engaging performances by the principles and because the producers were able to create some fun (albeit it often wholly preposterous) storylines on a limited TV budget. Garner, Garber, Olin and Rifkin are especially good, although the talents of Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Weisman should not be overlooked. Season 2 adds some solid emotional drama to the mix, as a person from Sydney's past returns. Good, fun entertainment, although the first two seasons are really the only two worth investing in. After Season 2, the plots get a little too stale or a little too convoluted. But if you're looking for two solid seasons of entertainment and can afford to skip the rest, this is a solid bet.",1310169600,,839,4.675675675675675

3700915,5,B001MVWRNO,"The 2nd season of Alias is probably the best season overall (the 1st is good as well, and has to be seen before the 2nd).

Two major reasons:

The script is particularly well thought, dealing simultaneously with several complex situations, while always taking care of bringing the relevant and necessary details to the audience at the right time. Situations are constructed step by step, logically. At times, you may think ""Why does this happen? Isn't that too easy"" but a second later a character says something to help the audience understand why that happens this way, logically.

The main characters, J.Garner and R.Rifkin in particular, play impressively. The right word,  level of emotion, expression on the face etc... and because of the many surprises and various situations in the script, this is arguably an achievement.

Highly recommended - Addiction ahead...",1248480000,,871,5.192857142857143

3700920,4,B001MVWRNO,"Last Year...on a very special ""Alias"":

Sydney Bristow, a young woman working on her PHd while working part-time at Credit Dauphine, leads a double life as a secret agent for SD-6 - purportedly a deep-cover branch of the CIA, but really a faction of ""The Alliance"", a global-network of arch-criminals who make hundreds of millions in arms sales, extortion and murder.  Warned by her father when SD-6 murders her fianc and then marks her for death, Sydney ""defects"" to the CIA, and becomes their double-agent.  Now Sydney conducts compound missions - operations for SD-6 which are really counter-missions for the CIA intended to bring SD-6 down.  Her only ally in SD-6 is her father, Jack Bristow, one of the few who knows the truth about the organization and its chief - the evil Arvin Sloane.  Sydney must navigate the tight channels between SD-6 and its rivals (other evil organizations, security operatives of the alliance obsessed with uncovering moles, etc.) and not infrequently other functionaries of the US Government.  In season 1, Syd faced several complications: the workings of a renaissance-era inventor named Rambaldi whose writings and inventions border on the prophetic and the apocalyptic, the shifting (and often selfish) loyalties of her homicidal father, the meddling of her reporter-friend Will Tippen and the truth about her mother, Laura Bristow (AKA KGB agent Irina Derevko, AKA ""the Man""). (MadTV spoofed this show with a rapid fire skit that parodied the many tangled webs of Sydney Bristow's life - the biggest joke is how much of the material was accurate.)

If that sounds like a lot, it is, especially since many of the episodes resolve around the same basic idea: a mission that involves Sydney sneaking into a highly-secured location in disguise, break into a secure vault or hack a computer using exotic technology, grab the goods, kick-box her way out.  Rinse and repeat.  Nevertheless, the show manages to work its plot twists in how these missions connect - a mission goes bad, and somebody's captured, is he worth the risk?; a mission goes too well, and SD-6 gets the goods before Sydney can get them to the CIA; and just how good is this intel anyway?  Brisk action keeps each episode going - also keeping us from wondering how SD-6's agents (presumably about as competent as Sydney, multilingual, combat-trained, techno-savvy and just so generally brilliant in so many other areas) never learn of SD-6's true nature while out in the field.

Tonight, on ALIAS!!
Everybody's loyalties are strained to the breaking point.  It begins with mom - Laura Bristow (referred almost all the time as ""Derevko"") revealing herself as ""The Man"", the shadowy head of an organization with a murderous efficiency rivaling that of SD-6.  Surrendering herself to the CIA (""The Enemy Walks In"") she proves in every way the perfect match for Jack Bristow.  Can she be trusted?  Sydney is torn, but her father is not - making us wonder how far he'll go to discredit her.  And what will happen when the Bristows take a family trip (hunting for WMD's in Kashmir)?  Meanwhile, Will Tippen's investigation into last season's murder of Sydney's fianc causes him to be sucked into the world of international espionage.  In order to ensure his promotion into the Alliance, the evil Arvin Sloane must execute his wife, Emily.  (Dying of cancer, Emily blabs what she knows about SD-6 to Syd, and then inconveniently goes into remission.)  When Sloane receives hints that Emily may be alive, he slowly goes off his hinges - or is it something else?  Season 2 gives more attention & action to characters given the side-order treatment last year, including Dixon, Marshall and even Asst. Director Kendall (Terry O'Quinn - YES!!!).

""Alias"" is a lot of fun even though it's also dated - having less in common with shows like ""Lost"", ""Heroes"" and the new BSG than the shows replaced by them (any of the reincarnations of ""Star Trek"").  ""Alias"" isn't about ordinary people in extraordinary situations; nor will we find Syd in a situation where her only hope is a tenacity she's not supposed to have.  And most graying of all, we never doubt that Syd's targets have it coming - they're all bad-guys, and the only bad consequences of Sydney's actions are further missions.  For all the murkiness about SD-6 or any pretension about how we're too modern to simplify the world into goodguys and badguys, once Syd's stilettos go into action, we need not worry that she's going after a totally innocent dude, or that the measures (or wardrobe) taken aren't overly extreme.  ""Alias"" is about as obsolete as a show can be, but it gives the spy-fi genre a great treatment, with larger-than-life (and meaner) characters, enigmatic loyalties and some beguiling questions.

STUFF THAT ALMOST KEPT US FROM TUNING IN:
No show is perfect, though ""Alias"" has some quirks which nearly abuse the privilege.  Needless celebrity guests (since they're stars, the show can't do that much to them or with them), too much important dialog spoken in quick and hushed tones, too much info spoken straight out (""subtext"" anyone?), too much gratuitous footage of Jennifer Garner's bod or of Syd in suggestive clothing (Yes, we know she's mega-hot, but that doesn't mean we should be treated like we're a bunch of stalkers) and too many artificially-emotional scenes with extra-sappy music playing in the background (if you're wife is a bigger fan of ""Grey's Anatomy"" or ""October Road"" than you are, you know what I'm talking about).

That aside, ""Alias"" is still a fun ride that sends the spy-thriller genre out with a bang.  Lena Olin is coolly sexy as the evil/motherly Derevko, while Victor Garber and Terry O'Quinn vie for the title of ""CIA's meanest"", while Ron Rifkind chews up the scenery as an archvillain in an age where such men are thought extinct.  The show is like one of Sydney's disguises, a sheath of artifice over a compelling and inescapable reality.",1199923200,,5940,4.945674044265593

Jennifer Garner, Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin also excel in this season.

Lots of Sydney's mom, Irina Derevko, and...plenty of twists and turns until the heart-stopping finale--a knockdown, drag out, no holds barred fight between...???  ... Well, you'll have to see for yourself.  It'll make you glad you already bought Season 3 before you finished watching Season 2.  It's that good.  Trust me.",1156291200,,631,4.672727272727273
3700931,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias was great throughout its 5-year run.  But Season 2 was king.  I can't point out any one thing that made me feel so, so I won't try.  I watched these on DVD, flying through the season in about a week and a half.  And when I reached the end, I was more in love with the series than ever.  I don't feel the need to explain important plot details because this has been done to death on here.  To put it short, if you've watched Season 1 of Alias but not Season 2, go pick it up and get watching.  You'll find yourself buying Season 3 shortly thereafter.  As has been mentioned, this is NOT a show about Jennifer Garner looking hot.  I mean, she does and all.  But once you watch, that becomes secondary or tertiary.  Alias is full of characters that matter to YOU.  I found myself feeling upset for several days after the death of one character later in the series.  It has that much of an impact on you.  Sydney, Vaughn, Dixon, Weiss, Francie, Will and the others will feel like family to you.  JJ Abrams is about creating shows that front as CIA missions or plane crashes; but he really uses these ideas as vehicles to tell stories of relationships between people.  If you've seen the Mission: Impossible movie series, you know that M:I:3 is much more character-driven than the previous two.  And it makes a difference.  If you've watched Lost, you know that it's about the characters, not the plane crashing.  The same goes for Alias.  If you are actually entertained by any of the current ""hit"" shows on TV, like Desperate Housewives, House, Grey's Anatomy or the like, and you haven't watched Alias, you're truly missing out.  You won't have any reason to watch those sub-par offerings after seeing a real show like Alias.  You will think to yourself ""God, I actually wasted my time watching these other shows all along???""  GO WATCH ALIAS, FOR ME!!!!",1154476800,,1858,4.497005988023952

3700933,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias reached an unimaginable goal in it's second season as it became one of the most addicting and critically acclaimed shows arround.

  The first season of Alias was great.  The second season is excellent, I'd even go on and say perfection.  The addition of Lena Olin to the cast gave the show a whole new twist, and you will find some of the most heart pounding hours of your life.

Highlights Include:

  - The Passage, Part 1 and 2: Sydney, Jack, and Irina must go on a mission together and try to destroy a top secret weapon, if they don't destroy each other first.

  - The Getaway: Sydney and Vaughn finally decide to try and take the next step in their relationship, if they don't get killed first by an Alliance Agent (guest star Faye Dunaway).

  - Phase One: The episode that turned the whole world of Alias upside down.  When a new director takes over for Arvin Sloane at SD-6, Jack and Sydney's secret status as double agents is at risk at being revealed.  Most notable for the unfortunate departure of a main character and a delicious new twist that continues through the rest of the season.  I dare you, try and turn off your television half way through this episode.

  - The Telling: The season finale that had everybody talking.  Is still considered by many one of the most shocking cliffhangers in television history.

See why Jennifer Garner won a Golden Globe for her portrayel as Sydney Bristow.  'Alias' has five star acting, top of the line storylines, and so many twist and turns that by the time the second season ends you'll be rushing out to find the third.",1154217600,,1587,4.546099290780142
3700934,5,B001MVWRNO,"This series must be watched from the very first episode or you'll miss the point entirely.  I first caught this show accidentally during reruns of the last season and I didn't think much of it.  I found many people felt that way when they began to catch an episode here and there on TNT.  Then a friend brought by the first 2 seasons of the show and asked me to give it a chance.  I put in the first disk and was sucked into the series by the 3rd episode.  I watched the entire season in one sitting.  I literally couldn't pull myself away from it.  I waited until Saturday to start the second season and I was glad I did.  I couldn't stop watching the second season either.  The day my friend came to collect his 2 seasons of Alias, I went out and bought them.  I'm hooked and will add every season to my collection as they become available.  It's a terrific show and worth every penny of the investment.  The scripts, actors, cinematography, story lines and casting is nothing short of superb.",1153440000,,995,4.318918918918919
3700935,5,B001MVWRNO,"The second season of Alias starts with a woman coming into a room, shooting her daughter in the shoulder in cold blood and then leaving. That is pretty much how it stays the whole season;action packed, fun, totally unrealistic and super entertaining.

The first season was pretty good but Alias reached all new heights in it's second season. Plots became more interwoven and complicated, the character development became even deeper and Jennifer Garner's acting improved heaps since season one.

Relationship development was the majour theme in this season, between all characters. JJ Abrams proved that he is a casting genius when he cast swedish actress Lena Olin as Sydney Bristow's Russian spy-mother Irina Derevko.

Lena proved to be an outstanding addition to the show and within a few episodes had become everyone's favourite character. The family dynamics between Irina, Sydney and her father was the thing that made this season rise above the rest.

TV was never so good.",1149292800,,980,5.144654088050315
3700936,5,B001MVWRNO,"While the first season of Alias definately was addicting, there was a certain formula to it all: the mistrust and lies SD-6 Operative Sydney Bristow had to tell, the countermissions she had to do since she was a double agent and the wig/dress of the week. Season 2 not only changed this slightly but gave the series a much needed booster that made it such an intriguing series that marathon watching is pretty much a given. Beware of watching this show since other stuff just might not get much attention.

Picking up where the season 1 finale left off, we find out Sydney's mother, Irina Derevko is not only alive and well but actually incredibly powerful in the crime world. Which what makes her next move surprising: she voluntarily surrenders to CIA, helping out with missions but is she really helping out or does she have long term plans?

The addition of the mother was definately a great one since it makes it a more compelling season emotionally. Not only is there the possibility Derevko can betray Sydney and her father Jack to their doom but that it was her own mother that did it is a great dynamic. Even by the end of it all, you're still not entirely sure which side the mother is on. Of course Lena Olin was a great casting decision and doesn't play it as that manipulative b*tch figure we'd expect to see, even though she kind of is.

Some shows have a real possibility of being incredibly stagnant and repetitive. Take shows like 24 for example, a well-loved show for drama fans. Each season is essentially the same: there's some problem and Bauer must do anything he can do save lives, all within 24 hours. Alias had this possibility with Sydney spending 5 season trying to shut down SD-6 but thankfully the shows goes through a refresher of sorts with the great midseason episode ""Phase One"".

The show over the years has a certain sense of preposterousness but then again this is a show with all these high-tech gadgetry and such so can you really blame certain things? Possibly since the entire premise of the show is built upon writings and inventions by a 15th century Nostradamus-like inventor named Rambaldi. Not to mention certain conveniences such as ""this extremely important intelligence came to us recently"". For such closely guarded secrets and classified things, there's often just a ""yep, we got this intel the other day, this important thing is here"". Well gee that was quick.

Shows like 24 and Alias, even shows like Veronica Mars seem to be born for DVD since it helps to watch everything when you feel like it, not having to worry about that shift you have or that commitment you made. Season 2 is definately a good one to check out.",1146960000,,2672,4.6405919661733614
3700937,5,B001MVWRNO,"I loved watching Alias Season 1, and looked greatly forward to watching the Season DVD 2 set pretty much straight through. I was completely thrilled to find that they had kept the great smart-spy action of Season 1 - while ratcheting the emotional and cohesivity of the storyline.

Season 1 had been in many ways a ""gimmick"" season. You had the unrequited love of Vaughn and Sidney. You had the new-costume-of-the-day in an exotic location. You had the everybody-is-lying aspect. While all of these were fun, they could have gotten old if we went through another season of that.

Instead, I really have to give great kudos to the writing / direction team here. They made some rather sweeping plot developments that turned everything on its head. Unlike many other shows where they drag out the angst for years, they let Vaughn and Sidney really connect. They had numerous great episodes with father, mother and daughter having fantastic interplay. Other plot developments were fascinating without seeming TOO contrived.

I had complained with Season 1 that a number of situations were quite illogical. They did a *much* better job in this season of having at least some base for why the various things happened. It could all make sense. Sydney wasn't throwing tantrums. Will was INCREDIBLY more mature and someone you could relate to. As always, even the ""bad guys"" had texture and meaning. They weren't just demonically possessed monsters - they had reasons for what they did that made sense. You could relate to them even while disapproving of them.

Even as a benefit, their last episode commentary doesn't seem to have any spoilers in it! I had a few things in season 2 ""ruined"" for me because when I watched the season 1 commentary they talked about things that only happened in season 2. They didn't do that in the commentary here, for which I was quite grateful. They commentaries are a ton of fun to listen to - it's well worth it.

The cliffhanger ending was *great* - again resounding with the emotional power of this season. It was just about the perfect ending to the season - and one that definitely made me eager to immediately start watching season 3.

There's one episode in particular that actually made me tear up, because it was so incredibly poignant. That's when you know that a TV show has really portrayed its characters well, when you care so much about them and what they are going through that it affects you that deeply, emotionally.

There is one clue about a major plot point that seems to have been completely missed by EVERYONE until it's ""too late"" - and it still baffles me how that could have happened plot-wise. Surely as soon as all of these brilliant deductors and researchers saw the clue they would have connected the dots. Again it's hard to talk about the situation without giving away fascinating plot development. Still, that was my only real complaint with the season. I wish they'd at least given some justification for everyone not considering the clue, since it was such an important item.

Highly recommended!",1144454400,,3057,4.809523809523809
3700938,5,B001MVWRNO,"I really need to put my credentials on the table to let you know where I'm coming from; I HATE ""NEWER"" TELEVISION. I have tried all the various forms; CSI this, NYPD that, they all leave me with a cold generic feeling. The characters by and large just do not seem like real people to me. I am always conscious I'm watching ""tv"". Now maybe it's too much to expect NOT TO however, being a fan of older TV I genuinely believe the characters from my olders shows ""exist"" in the world created. I'm a fan of many of the older shows; Columbo, All in the Family, Star Trek, etc., they just have genuine qualities I no longer find in tv.

Enter Netflix and Alias.

A friend loaned me ""Electra"", and I really liked Jen Garner, and from there I Netflixed Season One-Disc One of ""Alias"" (and almost DIDN'T!). Little did I know that would change how I view television... forever? From there I bought Season One and devoured it... whole. Then I bought Season Two, gave it a week and dove deep. I just watched ""Phase One"" Ep. 13 from S2 and was moved enough to write a review. I was struck with the realization that this may be the best show I have ever seen. How can it BE? I GREW UP with all my faves, surely nothing can overpower nostalgia... can IT? I think it can.
Alias: Season Two simply put is the quality of a big budget movie, every time out, with the familiarity of a close knit family. Each and every character has a purpose and each plot point leads to something bigger that is totally believeable, completely unexpected, but no less mind-blowing. Besides all that this series is without a doubt the most addictive television show ever created, it's definitely becoming unhealty:)

So, what now?

Well, I guess I still have half of a Season to get back to and sadly the ""buzz"" is that Seasons 3 and 4 fall short. While I do have this in the back of my mind I also remember hearing ""Millennium"" Season 3 was the worst and it was every bit as good as Season 2, so sometimes the buzz just needs to be swatted:)",1144368000,,2005,4.310344827586207

Aside from the amazing storylines of the show and the great acting and directing, it has wonderful extras.  I don't think I've seen funnier blooper reels than those found on the Alias DVDs.

3700941,4,B001MVWRNO,"First of all, there will be NO spoilers in this review, so feel free to read on if you were cautious about learning too much information.

ALIAS Season Two is essentially when the show lost its innocence. My only problem, which denied me giving it the 5-Star rating, concerns the first 9 episodes of Season Two.  These episodes are all exclusively concerned with the relationship between Sydney, her father Jack Bristow, and her mother Irina Derevko (a Russian KGB agent originally thought dead).  It all seemed entirely too artificial.  In fact, I'm being too kind.  The whole thing was dismal - the absolute worst being a two episode story line featuring the three Bristows hunting down nuclear explosives in India.

Yet right when I thought that all hope for the second season was lost, there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and Faye Dunaway shows up to give a spectacular turn as the slightly demented head of the Alliance's joint investigative unit, Ariana Kane.  And immediately following this tantalizing cameo comes one of the best pieces of network television I've ever seen -- Episode 13: ""Phase One.""  J.J. Abrams shows complete confidence in his fledgling show and changes everything we thought we knew about the world of ALIAS.

All in all, even with my gripes about the early season missteps, the second season of ALIAS is incredibly entertaining and mind boggling in its courage to destroy everything it had created within its small world and rebuild it from the ground up, piece by piece.  ALIAS Season Two is highly recommended.",1137801600,,1549,4.877862595419847

Sydney Bristow was awe-inspiring yet absolutely adorable from the get-go (due in no small part to the Golden Globe-winning intensity and adorability of actress Jennifer Garner). The production values and action pieces were of feature film quality. The writing was sharp, passionate, and often funny. Even the music was great! But the second season took all of that to an undreamed of higher level. You must watch Season One first to fully appreciate (and love) the characters and situations. But fasten your seatbelt when you get to Season Two. It's a wild, twisting, heartwrenching, thrill ride!",1137542400,,722,5.17948717948718

In this season, Sydney starts to get the family she never had.  The entire setup and premise of the show is washed clean.  Sydney starts a hot relationship with the even hotter Vaughn (her handler, if you know what I mean, ;-) And all of this doesn't even compare to the more-than-unnerving season finale that asks more questions than the SAT.

3700947,2,B001MVWRNO,"I'd characterize season one as intrigue for idiots; that is, it's pretty unsophisticated. Still, it was fun enough that I gave season two a try. The second season has a strong start, eliminating some of the formulaic episode endings and repetitive case/counter-case briefings, but a few things get worse and worse as the season progresses.

First, there are some really cheesy action scenes; poor imitations of things you've seen in movies. Nice effects for a TV program, but already done better on film. The similarity makes them comical, which is grating when it happens in a serious action sequence. See how many movie sequences you recognize.

Next, some of the gadgets are pretty dumb. You can view this Bond element either with naive awe or with amusement in season one, but in season two it's difficult to find them funny (they're just too dumb), so if you aren't easily impressed you'll find them grating. The small bit of good news is that there are fewer of them in season two.

Third, and continuing in the suspension of disbelief theme, the silly plot element they introduced in season one, which I won't mention by name so as to avoid spoilers, isn't resolved in season two. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen season one. The grand theme behind the motivation for Arvin Sloan. That annoying thing that makes season one slightly fantasy-ish is back in season two, more persistent in the plot than ever, less believable than ever. And they don't wrap it up! It'll be back in season three. Groan.

And here's where I have to talk about predictability. This season is less predictable than season one, but only slightly so. There are two things that aren't wrapped up in the season, though, three if you count the ""cliff-hanger"" ending, but that's new and what I want to complain about next is the stuff that just takes too long to resolve given that things tend to resolve in this show predictably.

There's the above-mentioned fantasy-ish element. The best that could become of this is that it turns out to be a hoax perpetrated by someone Sloan seeks on a mountain top in season two, but it's dragged on too long to end that predictably. It better not end that way. But the alternative is that I'm supposed to take it seriously. And I don't want to. Seriously.

There's also the is-she-a-good-guy-or-is-she-a-bad-guy question with Syndey's mom. We think we know, but maybe we're wrong. There'd be room for surprise here except that either outcome is already cliche! Mercifully, we went through this with dad much more quickly. Or maybe Sloan will turn out to be a good guy. That'd be a twist. But that'd be cliche, too!

In short, the plot elements of this show just aren't interesting enough to drag on as long as they do. By the time things resolve it doesn't really matter how they resolve. You've already accounted for both the obvious outcome and the predictable twist.

Lastly, there are commercials on disc one. They're easy to skip, but I hate being treated like a mindless consumer, and I really don't like paying for ads. Speaking of which, there is really cheesy in-show product placement in this season. A preview of the future of television, and I don't like it. The Ford spots within the episodes are *aweful*. Totally out of character for the show.

Yeah, I'm still going to try season three :-)",1131667200,,3334,4.744386873920552
3700948,4,B001MVWRNO,"Alias Season 2 contains twenty-two action-packed episodes that will leave you wanting more.  However, starting with episode thirteen, ""Phase One,"" some big shake-ups start to occur.  I will not say who, but a favorite character is brutally killed.  I was shocked and disheartened by this.  There is commentary on this episode by JJ Abrams, Jennifer Garner, Jack Bender, Greg

Grunberg, Michael Vartan, and Victor Garber.  Even though it is a serious episode, the commentary is hilarious.  I was rolling on the floor.

The main development in Season Two is the appearance of Sydney's presumed-dead mother.  Throughout the episodes, Sydney does not know whether or not to trust her mother.  Irina Derevko is played with hypnotic power by Lena Olin. Olin looks so much like her TV ""daughter,"" it is unsettling.

The next main development is the budding romance between Sydney and Michael Vaughn, her CIA case handler.  Last, there is Will, having to humiliate himself in public by pretending to be a recovering drug addict.  In private, Vaughn is trying to help him get a job with the CIA.

The chemistry of the cast is terrific.  These actors and actresses are all tremendous.  They work so well together that their portrayals of these characters seem completely real.",1129420800,,1266,5.043478260869565

3700951,5,B001MVWRNO,"When ""Alias: Season One"" ended, fans found themselves in quite the dilemma, there was still 3 months at least until we find out just what will happen to Sydney (Jennifer Garner).  ""Alias: Season One"" proved to both critics and ABC that a spy show that is mostly realistic yet sometimes deals with the supernatural can really work with audiences and produce solid ratings for ABC, something they were only getting from their other big-time drama, ""NYPD Blue"".

""Alias: Season Two"" picks up exactly where ""Alias: Season One"" left off.  This new season would bring plenty of new surprises to Sydney and company.  The addition of Sydney's traitorous mother proved to be a real source of trouble as no one knew whether or not Irina Derevko could ever be trusted or was she always working an angle.  Sydney became increasingly torn between her loyalty to her work and the love a daughter has for her mother.  This season would also shake things up in the world of ""Alias"" around the halfway point of the season, the dynamic of the show completely changes, and in a good way.  The change launches the show in a new direction and propelled the show through to the action-packed season finale, with one whopper of a cliffhanger.

""Alias: Season Two"" continued the break-kneck speed of the first season and never let up.  Audiences were constantly trying to keep up with just what Irina had planned for Jack and her daughter, Sydney.  With even more twists and turns than season one, ""Alias: Season Two"" was an exhausting thrill ride that left everyone gasping as the credits rolled on the season finale.

The quality of ""Alias"" continues as brilliant writing, directing, and acting continue to make this show one of the most successful on ABC.  Just like the previous season, ""Alias: Season Two"" is a must-see!",1120608000,,1801,4.811688311688312
3700952,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias Season 2 is a pretty perfect follow-up to the awesome first season of the show.  Now, season one is still my favorite between the two seasons - however, season one (towards its ending) had become a little bit too formulaic - and to continue the tradition of season one into the second season would have been a mistake on the writer's part.  Of course, season 2 had to bring something different to the table - and boy did they shake things up.  Never before have I sat on the couch screaming at the TV like I have throughout my watching of Alias' second season.  There are so many moments where you will be angered by the direction the writer's have made some of the characters take - but when you look back on it - you realize how (in the big scheme of things) perfect the decision was.

I think that Sydney's relationship with her mother is the greatest storyline in this season.  As an audience, you will find yourself gripping with the trust issue just as Sydney does - ""Irina's good, she just wants a relationship with her daughter - no she's bad and she's deceitful and she's going to hurt Sydney.""  Oh, trust me, you'll go back and forth throughout the season.

I consider ""Phase One"" to be the best episode of this season - followed very closely by the season finale - ""The Telling.""  And unlike Season one, many of these episodes don't end in a cliff-hanger type fashion - but that's ok for season 2 because it resembles a much different style from that of season one.  But like I said before - it's a good and very essential change that keeps the show number one in my book.  All of the actors play their roles with such perfection it's hard not to believe these characters truly do exist.

3700955,4,B001MVWRNO,"4.5 stars.  There are two reasons why I cannot give this 5 stars.  The first is that, while the predictability is not nearly as blatant as Season 1, there are still moments when the plotting is clearly drawn out(e.g. Marshall flies in an airplane for the first time and is so frightened that he packs a compact parachute under his jacket, and it isn't too long before that little device proves to be useful; another section was so predictable I rolled my eyes, as a foreign contact is made more human by revealing something about him personally--why not just put a red bullseye on his back?)  However, there are so many twists that I actually gasped at, that all the rest is eventually forgivable.  The acting is once again excellent, as is the actual filmmaking.  The addition of Lena Olin is the best reason to continue watching this series, where she provides a seductively evil presence with all-too-obvious nods to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" character Hannibal Lecter.  There are plenty of action sequences that are suspenseful and fight scenes where the chroeography is so sharp that it is dance-like.  If you enjoyed Season 1, Season 2 will knock you out!  The final cliffhanger simply isn't fair in light of the fact that I haven't ordered Season 3 yet; it was another twist I was not expecting.

3700957,5,B001MVWRNO,"Premiering in September 2001, Alias has built a steady and loyal following among television viewers. The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files. It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman. But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...

Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency. However, problems arise when her fianc is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all... In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent. Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work. Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...

The Alias (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Enemy Walks In"" in which, following a long search (most of Season 1), Sydney finds her mother. Meanwhile, Michael has been swept away by a tsunami in the Pacific, and it remains up in the air as to whether or not he's still alive... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Cipher"" in which Sydney is forced to match wits with Khasinau's front man, Sark, while Jack meets with Sydney's mother (whom he once believed to be dead), and ""Phase One"" in which SD-6 gets a new director to replace Sloane...

3700958,5,B001MVWRNO,"On the surface it's lots of sexy outfits, gadgets, and guns, the hat-tip to the Bond legacy. But there's quite a bit more to Alias than that.

When season one drew to a close, I thought to myself, ""How are they going to top this?"" And so they introduced Irina Derevko, Sydney's mother, a pitch-perfect performance by Lena Olin (and sadly, one that only lasted the duration of this season). The added family angle added even more depth and intrigue to a show already neck-deep in it. The demise of SD-6 and The Alliance halfway through the season turns the Alias world upside-down, and we see relationships tested and characters pushed to their limits (Will and Dixon immediately spring to mind). I doubt you'll find such excellent ensemble acting elsewhere on network TV (outside The West Wing or 24, anyway). Even characters outside the core cast stand out. I'm sure you'll grow to love David Anders as the enigmatic Mr. Sark and Terry O'Quinn (currently playing Locke in Lost, another J.J. Abrams masterpiece) as hard-nosed Assistant Director Kendall. Then there are some wonderful guest appearances by Ethan Hawke and Christian Slater, among others.

I'm frantically scrambling for the right words to finish this review, but I am forced to conclude that the experience is indescribable. See it, believe it, come back for season three.",1113523200,,1337,4.964285714285714

3700961,5,B001MVWRNO,"Same intense fun, second season!

I think what I enjoy most about this series is not the action packed, nail biting adventures, but the characters!  The interplays of the mysterious and complicated Jack Bristow, the evil but somehow likeable Arvin Sloane, the pretty-boy lover Michael Vaughn, the nerdy genius Marshall Flinkman, the steely but kind hearted Marcus Dixon... they all come together in a fantastic melody of fun and adventure that keep you wanting more, and more, and more.

Even some of the side players such as Will Tippin, Irina Derevko, and FBI Assistant Director Kendall turn in stellar performances.

I think what makes this series so much fun is that despite the slightly science-fiction, over-the-edge nature of the show, and despite our knowledge that deep-secret agents who defy death five times a day don't actually exist in real life, we none the less fall in love with each of the characters.  We relate, we want to be them, and the story line gives them enough actual life problems that they become real and tangible, and not the paper-thin cut outs so typical of similar shows.

3700963,5,B001MVWRNO,"Series creator J.J. Abrams scored a coup when he got international movie star Lena Olin to sign on for the second season of ""Alias"".  Playing the long-lost KGB agent mother of Sydney Bristow (series star Jennifer Garner), Olin adopted many of Garner's mannerisms (including gait, a slowly widening smile, and a distinctive tucking of her long hair behind one ear) to imply an inherited bond deeper than a 20-year absence would normally signify.

To these Garneresque traits Olin added a fanatical focus on her (obscure) goals.  If you've seen ""Romeo is Bleeding"" you'll know just how intense Olin can be.  But instead of the manic glee of the movie's Mona Demarkov, in ""Alias"" Olin has the calm intensity of a Zen master.  She can be sitting, perfectly still, and still project deadly menace.

Irina Derevko, Lena Olin's character, is pivotal from the very start of the season.  Walking out of the shadows we (and Sydney) first see her face.  Sydney says ""Mom?"" -- and Irina calmly shoots her daughter.

I won't go into great detail to avoid spoiling the ride for all you current (or potential) ""Alias"" fans.  But it's thrilling to watch Irina Derevko promoting her mysterious agenda, with the audience and Sydney never knowing exactly where her allegiances lie.  There's the usual plotline driven by creepily avuncular bad guy Arvin Sloan and his quest for the workings of 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi.  The series changes direction halfway through with the SuperBowl episode.  And of course Sydney Bristow continues to be slicker than James Bond, but she's being steered by her mother's invisible strings more often than not this time around.  If you want to know just how a superagent like Sydney Bristow can come to be, Lena Olin as her cooler-than-ice mother is the perfect recipe.  It's a shame Abrams couldn't get Olin to return for Season Three.

Notable guest stars for Season Two include Terry O'Quinn, Patricia Wettig, Amy Irving, Derek de Lint, Faye Dunaway, Angus Scrimm, Olivia D'Abo, Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater, and Tracy Middendorf.

3700964,4,B001MVWRNO,"Season 2 was great and made even greater by the luscious Lena Olin. Every word that spills from her lips is coated with sensuality. Oh, err... sorry!
As I was saying, season 2 was great. The cast is wonderful. Of course, it's difficult to relate what happens to anything real but it's a minor point this season. The one thing that really annoys me is this: Sidney can kick the butts of 3 or 4 highly trained men fairly easily but she has hard time getting the better of any one woman she challenges.
I wonder if it's Hollywood's ridiculous habit of trying to make us think that women are tougher than men; which of course is absurd. These TV producers must have a good reason for doing this. It might be related to when they get home at night. As Ross would say, ""The word you're looking for is ... Anyway!""
I'd also like to see the writers make an attempt at writing at least ONE joke in each episode. It would give the impression that these actors are playing human beings instead of cyber-organisms.
Season 2 is almost relentless with action. And it's fun to watch. Jennifer is perfect and I can't imagine any other actress playing Sidney Bristow better than she does. And Victor Garber is also excellent as the unflappable agent who can take care of ANY problem. There's a bit of a slow-down midway through the season which is disappointing and brings us into the somewhat dislocated season 3.

Season 2 begins right where Season 1 left off Sydney handcuffed to an iron chair.  For the last half of the 1st season all we could focus on was who is ""The Man"" and the finale finally revealed his true identity.  In the first episode Syd is shot by someone she thought was gone and sees her trying to help a friend in distress.  Season 2 is lightyears ahead of Season 1 in a sense that most of the best episodes of the series came from this season.  This season brings a dysfunctional family element, a friend who doesn't seem like herself, the frame of another friend and the conclusion to Syd's goal which is short lived.  ""The Telling"" the finale has one of the most shocking and breath taking cliff hangers in T.V. leaving you dying to know the truth. If there is one show you should watch this is the one.  Alias has redefined T.V. as we know it.",1102636800,,924,4.275862068965517
3700966,5,B001MVWRNO,"Just when you thought that it was over, it's not.  Hi mom!  What's up?  She's still alive?  NO WAY!  And she turned herself in?  What's she up to?

That's how we begin the 2nd season of Alias.  We're still against the evil Alliance, and a couple things have changed.  Arvin is now a chairman of the Alliance, Mommy Dearest is helping the CIA from an undisclosed holding cell, and well, Syd and Vaughn are still 'Syd and Vaughn'.  Expect some crazy stuff to happen this time, as Sydney's mom, Irina Derevko, gives intel to help the CIA bring down SD-6 and The Alliance for good.  That is, until, they bring down SD-6 in the incredible episode, ""Phase One"", where everything totally changes, and the race against time truly, truly begins.  Wait until you see what happens with Will and Francie.  Not everything is as it seems.  Remember that as you keep on watching.

Now, Alias took a serious risk with 'Phase One'.  The whole reason and face of the show completely changed.  Before, it was Syd as the super double agent going against all odds against her, and keeping her identity as secret.  Now, there's no secret to be kept, and things are even worse than they imagined?  How could that be?  Is mom really devoted to helping the CIA?  What really happens to Sloane?  Millions of questions are asked and only some are answered as you have to wait until season 3 to finally figure some stuff out, as that season asks even more questions.

I actually liked this season better than the first, as it changed things up a bit, and it ended up being more exciting.  Let the good times roll, and buy this set, especially if you're a couch potato.  It'll give a whole new meaning to that kind of life.  :)

Starring Jennifer Garner, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, and Lena Olin (Syd's estranged mother), this thrill rides ups and downs just got steeper and more dangerous than ever.  Enjoy!",1101168000,,1895,4.559523809523809
3700967,3,B001MVWRNO,"Season Two of Alias derails hard throughout its first half, before awkwardly getting back on track for a fine second half.  The season pales before the bright and energetic Season One, but this is the better season in one key area: namely, the action is handled more maturely.  In Season One, all super-agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) needed to survive in the world of international espionage was a few martial arts moves and a wig.  This season she actually carries a weapon on missions, but she still delves into ""Buffy"" garbage, unrealistically high-kicking her way out of danger.  Production values are also improved.  Season One looked great, but each episode of Two looks like a glossy film.  Stories are more intelligently constructed this time out, improving upon the narrow-minded video game-style storylines of Season One.

Picking up from the first season's cliffhanger ending, Season Two opens with Sydney the captive of her turncoat mother, Irina Derevko.  Syd soon escapes, but not long afterward her mother turns herself in to the CIA, though no one's sure why.  This proves to be the gist of Season Two: Syd and her fellows will go out on missions, using info gleaned from the apparently-omniscient Derevko.  At the same time, Syd must come to terms with her mother (which entails LOTS of crying; the melodrama's piled on thick this season, people), while also moving in on hawk-nosed and pinch-faced love interest Michael Vaughn, whose father, of course, was murdered long ago by Sydney's mother.  Yes, Alias takes place in a very small world.

This repetitive storyline with Derevko also harms my favorite character in the show: Victor Garber's Jack Bristow, who basically acts as a forlorn, cynical foil throughout most of the season.  On the other hand, Ron Rifkin is free to ham it up as the villainous Arvin Sloane, and he carries the first half of Season Two.  Jennifer Garner gets lots of opportunities to hone her drama skills, and I have to admit that she comes off as a very likeable person.  No wonder so many guys are crazy about her.  It's mostly the skills of the actors which carry you through the muddled first part of this season, but then on Disc 4 of the set, things change fast.

Apparently creator/producer JJ Abrams decided a change was due, not just to a few storylines, but to the framework of the show itself.  Previous to this change, the series had followed the same pattern each episode: Syd would receive her mission from SD-6, plan a countermission with Vaughn and the CIA, go out on the job, get in a few scrapes, and arrange it so that the CIA benefited from the mission and SD-6 did not, all while struggling to retain her cover.

With one fell stroke, Abrams crumbles this foundation, halfway through Season Two.  Gone are SD-6, the mission/countermission scenario, the constant, tearful trips to Derevko's prison cell for info, and most importantly, the nauseating ""will they or won't they?"" Syd/Vaughn shenanigans.  In a way, the change streamlines the series, but it's very jarring, and characters change without warning.

For one, Sloane's character becomes a cold-blooded, murderous mastermind, more of a comic book caricature than the steely schemer he'd been before.  Same for British nuisance Sark, who quickly goes from being a mischievous presence to an outright deadly one.  In fact, shortly after his intro early in the season, it's hinted that Sark and Sydney could become involved (he flirts with her and she claims he is ""cute""), and it's even hinted that the two of them share a lot in common, as Sark says that he considers Irina Derevko a mother figure.  But all such promise is cast aside as Sark morphs into a one-note murdering machine, one who becomes even more of an infuriating nuisance (for the viewer, not just for Sydney) in Season Three.

But the most frustrating change the mid-season switch-up creates is the quick and unbelievable wrap-up of the SD-6/Alliance network.  Season One featured multiple scenes in which Sydney was reminded that it would take at least several years to wipe out not only SD-6, but the global Alliance organization.  This is conveniently forgotten, as in one single episode Sydney and her CIA pals are able to crush the entire core of the Alliance.  It's awkward and not very well thought out.  It seems like what it apparently was: Abrams getting bored with the corner he'd written himself into, and wanting to do something different.  However, I can't complain too much, because one of the best things about Season Two is the lack of all of the ""chosen one"" prophecy ""Buffy""-type nonsense which was hinted at in Season One, and which unfortunately returns with a mind-numbing vengeance in Season Three.

The season takes a while to get going, but early on there's a well-done multiple-episode storyline in which Sydney, her father, and her mother must infiltrate a former Soviet prison to unearth nuclear warheads.  It's later in the season when things really pick up: there's the infamous ""Super Bowl episode,"" which more than any other in the series' history brought the show into the public eye, as it was broadcast at an ideal time slot and opened with several shots of Sydney in revealing lingerie, brilliantly capturing the interest of all of the testosterone-laden Super Bowl viewers.  Even better is a late-season episode in which Syd's pal Will, former journalist turned CIA analyst, must survive a commando attack on the prisoner transport he's held captive in.

Special mention must be made of the episode with Ethan Hawke, one of the episodes after the mid-season shake-up which displays the true promise of the show's ""spy-fi"" makeup.  Speaking of guest stars, they get pretty annoying this season, particularly Faye Dunaway, who looks like a walking skeleton in her portrayal of an Alliance interrogator.  And speaking just in terms of action, the show packs more explosions and a lot more gun fights than Season One, though serious action fans will be more impressed by the first half of Season Three.  Sci-fi fans will however enjoy the second half of this season, which features cloning and other high-tech concepts more comfortable in a science fiction film.

Anyway, Season Two is a bumpy ride, but a mostly enjoyable one.  The DVD presentation is flawless, both in picture and sound.  Even the packaging is an improvement upon Season One's bootleg-like appearance.  It's just that the show mercilessly shatters itself apart mid-season harms the integrity of the series, even if it improves certain aspects at the same time. So I give this season a half-hearted recommendation.",1100649600,,6613,4.963702359346643

I quickly went through the Season One set and immediately went out and grabbed the season 2 and 3 sets.  Having just finished Season Two, I have to say that you are in for quite a ride!

There isn't anythin else to say but pay attention and try to watch without disractions because you might miss something that will pay off over the course of the next few episodes.  Spoilers aside, the casting is great the characters have grown and the story arc is very suspenseful.

I'm starting on Season Three, hopefully to begin watching Season Four from the beginning in Jnauary, but I know I won't be able to wait that long. Maybe I'll just spin these discs again.",1099353600,,791,4.346938775510204
3700970,5,B001MVWRNO,"""Alias"" is one of those shows in which so much happens in such a relatively short amount of time, that if you were to miss anything more than a couple of episodes in a row you'd likely get completely lost. This simple fact is even more true of this, the second season of episodes, than it was of the first. That's what makes it so much fun to watch.

J.J. Abrams and his crew keep you guessing in every episode of ""Alias.""  This show has the intelligence and production quality of some of the best thrillers that have appeared on the silver screen, and the consistency of quality and of storyline is nothing short of miraculous. The list of major talent that continue to appear in this show just grows and grows... in this season you'll see Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater, and Richard Lewis (among others) appearing in relatively short-term roles, while the talents of Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Lena Olin, and the incomparable Jennifer Garner continue to shine. And the talent behind the camera is no less notable; everything from the writing to the direction to the music is simply top-notch, especially by the standards of the vast majority of most network shows.

It would be Wrong -- yes, with a capital W -- for me to give away any of the frequent plot twists and turns that you'll encounter in the second season of ""Alias."" I will tell you that you can't rely on the standard markers of a television season to tell you when to watch for ""something"" to happen. The final episode of the season is pretty climactic, to be sure, but no less so than one thing that happens midway through the season which changes the very nature of the show and everyone in it. Frankly, I've never seen this sort of transformation happen to a show in mid-season, but the way they pull it off in this season of ""Alias"" is nothing short of genius. And that's all I can tell you.  Sorry to be so secretive, but really, did you expect anything else?

My advice to you is this: make sure you've already watched the first season of ""Alias"" because without that you'll be lost. Many important plot elements carry over from that season to this one. Once you've seen that, try to watch these 22 episodes with as few distractions as possible. Say something or blink at the wrong moment, and you're likely to miss some minor detail that will have a major effect 6 or 10 episodes down the line. A tale is being told here in broad strokes, its creators have clearly thought it out ahead of time, and you won't want to miss a moment.",1099180800,,2503,4.480263157894737

She manages to escape, even after her mother shoots her in the shoulder, and makes it back to her father and will, whose story about SD-6 has just made news. Vaughn is still missing, but that soon changes withing the first half of the premiere. Will is forced to ""become"" a drug addict to avoid death at the hand of the Alliance. Sydney barely escapes death also, after Dixon confesses to her belief of being a double agent. Lucky her dad is friends w/ sloane. at premiere's end, sydney speaks at arvin sloanes' wife, emily, funeral, where she learns that Irina Derevko aka Laura Bristow has turned herself into the CIA.

By finale's end, Sydney's entire co-star cast has had something changed about them-ultimately leading to what many consider the best fight scene in the show. and one that leaves sydney in a strange place-and a startling discover that will have to wait until season 3 to be answered. In closing alias season 2 is a great continuation w/ minor continuity errors (mainly after phase one) which only hardcore fans will catch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!",1093824000,,2080,4.685792349726776
3700975,5,B001MVWRNO,"I didn't think Alias could get any better than it's intense first season but it did. I never watched the show on tv, but thanks to the dvds I was able to check out what all the hype was about. I watched Season 1 in 3 days, and immediately watched Season 2. I was blown away by the second season. It's even more exciting and dramatic, with almost every episode revealing something shocking. Most of this is thanks to the brilliant Lena Olin who joins the cast as Sydneys mother. The storyline is brilliant and there were plenty of Oh My God moments. This season also gave more for Francie (Merrin Dungey) and Will (Bradley Cooper) to do. Their storylines were just as exciting and intense, and cultivated in a fantastic final episode that could go down as one of the best cliffhanger episoded in television. All of this though could not be possible without the amazing Jennifer Garner. Proving once again she was one of the best actresses on television today. How she manages to pull off what she does every week is beyond me. Emmy voters need to honor her very soon. Alias continues to provide some of the best hours on television I have ever seen.",1093392000,,1148,4.497607655502392
3700976,5,B001MVWRNO,"Like many ALIAS fans, I have a slight preference for Season One, though only slight.  I think the show lost a bit of direction immediately following the destruction of the dreaded SD-6, and I continue to think that the killing of Frenchie and replacing her with Allison was a wretched mistake, but despite that, the show kept up the action, ratcheted up the plot tension, and maintained an exceptionally high level of writing and production.  One of the finest things of Season Two was the presence of Lena Olin as Sydney's mother.  Is there a more beautiful woman near the age of fifty on planet earth?  Tragically, Ms. Olin has declined to return to the show either as a regular either in Season Three or the upcoming Season Four.  One only hopes that she will change her mind.  She manages to imbue Irina Derevko with a host of both known and unknown qualities.  Even after an entire season of seeing her in action, we remains a profound mystery, despite our confidence that she really does love her daughter.

Despite the couple of bumps mentioned above, the show hits on all eight cylinders all season long.  Many TV series relay on a fair amount of filler, but virtually every scene in ever episode either advances the story or provides scintillating action.  Although I still prefer BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (easily the major influence on the show as a whole--once could write a long review on the resemblances between the two shows) for its superior dialogue (indeed, with perhaps the exception of the first season of WEST WING, no show can rival BUFFY for its talk) and perpetual focus on human emotion rather than action (in BUFFY, the action is always subservient to the emotions, while in ALIAS the action often takes on a life of its own), I would be willing to argue that ALIAS is perhaps the finest action show of all time.  By the way, another parallel between BUFFY and ALIAS is that technology functions in ALIAS the exact same way that magic does in BUFFY:  when introduced, regardless of how unexplained or improbable the magic or technology is, the purpose is to advance the plot.

The members of the cast shine even brighter in Season Two, as they all seem to become comfortable in their roles.  What is amazing is that no one seems to flag or encounter dead spots, regardless of the demands made upon him or her.  The guest stars are simply outstanding, as well as being far better known than is typical in a television series.  Amy Irving, Quentin Tarantino, Christian Slater, Ethan Hawke, and many others all enhance an already outstanding cast.  Tarantino in particular is absolutely perfect for the show, and one regrets that his other activities stands in the way of his being a more persistent presence in the show.  He will return, thankfully, in Season Three.

All in all, ALIAS remains a refreshing exception to the usual TV fare, a happy alternative to the endless procedural cop shows.  Although showing on ABC, one would swear that it was a FOX creation, though since FOX cancels most of its best shows before they get off the ground (e.g., FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS).  It remains edgy, original, and very, very slick, and one of the very few shows on TV worth paying attention to.",1092960000,,3211,4.708407871198569

With wonderful performances by Victor Garber, Lena Olin, and Jennifer Garner, the episodes featured not only great acting but exciting spy plots rich in twists and turns. ""Phase One,"" the midseason episode that changed the face of the show, is one of the best done episodes in television drama, as it tied up a continuing plot line only to introduce a new, very sinister one.

There is NOTHING better than watching a tv show with NO commercial interuptions.
The bonus materials on the DVD are also entertaining and gives you something to look forward to after you view the final episode.  The blooper reel is hysterical and Jennifer Garner is just a charm.

3700987,5,B001MVWRNO,"As season 1 ended, Sydney's supposedly dead mother was walking, literally, back into her life.  But that hardly prepares her for the year ahead.  Her mother turns herself into the CIA, but will only deal with Sydney.  Now that Will knows the truth about what she does, she has someone to talk things over with, but he begins to get more involved in her life looking for a job.  Her relationship with her father continues to hit road blocks based on what she learns from her mother.  And she must hide her feelings for her CIA handler from everyone, including herself while continuing to work from the inside to take down SD-6.  Over there, someone is toying with Sloan, dropping hints that his wife might not really be dead.
Confused yet?  It's only the beginning.  But that's a good thing.
Season 1 of this show was outstanding, with multiple storylines effortlessly happening at once.  This season starts out at the top of its game as well, with more questions then answers and many twists to the plot.  I was disappointed with the twists half way through.  While the show is still great, it lost something for me at that point.  Simplifying wasn't necessarily better, in my opinion.  And I still am upset by what they did to Francie even though it's been over a year.  Of course, the acting continued to be top notch, and Lena Olin was absolutely outstanding joining the cast as Sydney's mother.
Fans of the show will love this DVD set.  The entire second season is presented here in widescreen with surround sound.  As you'd expect from a recently filmed show, it looks and sounds outstanding.  The set includes 4 audio commentaries by various members of the cast and crew.  These are fun and informative, even if they do degrade a few times into self-love fests.  The bulk of the special features are on the final disc.  These include deleted scenes and a fun gag reel.  There is a 45 minute documentary on the making of the final episode of the season.  It covers ever aspect of the production from script to post, but more time seems to be spent on the final fight of the season then on any other aspect.  Still, it was fascinating.  The featurette on the look of Alias covers both seasons and is an interesting look at the wigs and costumes Sydney wears on her various missions.  There are only a few TV promos.  The four radio interviews are old news to us by now, but still interesting to listen to.
While I was a little disappointed this season didn't quite measure up to season 1, they had an impossibly high goal to reach.  I still tuned in every week without fail, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this set.  Obviously, I'm still hopelessly hooked on this great TV show.

3700988,5,B001MVWRNO,"The first season was pretty good. The second was even better. The second year of adventures of female James Bond, played by Jennifer Garner (which is so natural in this role) brings a suspence that, at least for me, was somewhat missing in the first season. You really can't wait for the next episode. Fortunately, we have this on DVD now, otherwise I can't imagine how I would survive between the episodes. The success of the first season was compounded by mostly good acting by not very famous (then) actors. Second season brought more famous actors. Some of them, such as Christian Slater, have brief appearance and some, such as Lena Olin, play major part. I just loved Lena Olin as mother of Sidney Bristow. There is this great chemistry between her and Jennifer Garner. The mistery, surrounding her, keeps you guessing until the end of the season. Oh, well, the mistery still there - have to wait the next season. The only complaint is that both seasons are not self contained - you really have to wait for the next one since previous seasons stop in the middle of the action in the most suspensful moment.",1077235200,,1112,4.649746192893401

Vaughn (Michael Vartan) is still missing, and her friend Will (Bradley Cooper) is still with Sark (David Anders).  After Syd escapes, she and her father, Jack (Victor Garber), save Will and Vaughn.  Soon after, the CIA attempts to capture Direvko, but they fail.  But in an unexpected turn, she willingly turns herself in to the CIA.  She begins aiding Sydney in her missions by giving her hints and clues that always turn out to be valid.  Sydney wants to start trusting her, but Jack always retains his skepticism.  I won't give away any other plot lines because I have already said too much.
The acting remains solid, the stories are still great, and the action is better than ever.  In fact, many of the stories are improved; last season, the episodes started off as stand-alones, but eventually, arcs began to form.  This season, the arc has already been established, and they are elaborated on beyond belief.  I would have to say that one of my favorite episodes is the Super Bowl episode that begins with the great lingerie scene.  Other great episodes include the Marshall-centric episodes where he is brought on a mission with Sydney, the Doomsday Device episode, and the amazing season finale with a shocking twist.

From the moment she walks in at the beginning of the season to the last moment in the finale where she leaves Sydney Bristow with ""I love you"", every single moment is cherished.
The Bristows are the perfect spy family and one of the best episodes this season was the two parter ""The Passage"".
We saw the fall of SD-6 and the alliance in ""Phase One"", a brilliant episode that includes drama, romance, suspense, action and comedy all in 40 mintues.  That single episode will give you more satisfaction that any given movie that is out at this time. JJ is truely brilliant!!
The fall of SD-6 gave way to the Sydney/Vaughn romance for us shippers.  And it was long awaited and well worth the wait.

Not only does this season dramatically improve upon an already impressive debut set, but it ranks among the best single seasons of television EVER.
From the season opening reveal of her mom, to the season-ending ""two years?"" line, these 22 episodes had enough twists, turns, stunts, and action set pieces to keep you glued to your screen. Freakin' epoxy.
In retrospect, I could not have handled having had to wait a week for each installment. I would have required medication.
The acting is sublime. Jennifer Garner does WAY more than she has to; her Sydney will prove to be an all-time great TV heroine. Victor Garber is astonishing. If you really want to see what a character he's created, check out the gag reel on disc six. When he breaks character, it's as if he transforms back into Garber with a fingersnap. It's disarming.
Ron Rifkin, as Sloane, continues his portrayal as one of the most continually interesting villains of modern times.
And Lena Olin. What a casting coup. It's tragically cliche, but I could not for a moment take my eyes off of her.
The rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. They seamlessly blend humor, pathos, tragedy, suspense, mystery, intrigue and old-fashioned Bondian shoot-em-ups. Marshall, to single out one character, is a delight.
The relationship between Sydney and Vaughn developed into one of the great modern TV romances. It feels honest. True. I came to care about these two individuals.
So much about this series is so far above everything else on TV. The MacGuffin Rimbaldi artifacts start to become tiresome near the end, but I quibble.

With all the fighting you will want to learn how to yourself.",1074038400,,589,4.168141592920354
3700997,5,B001MVWRNO,"In my review of Season 1, was really high on this program, despite a strong dislike of commercial TV. The casting, scriting, effects and plotting were all first rate, and the DVD format in cases like this, where watching over and over is required, eliminates those brainless commercials.
Season 2 is better in every way. The plotting and scripting is better and the suspense is more intense. Saying much more would give away the story line, so I will say only this: no one who likes action and suspense will be disappointed with this product.
My only disappointment is that I will have to wait a long time for the next installment.",1074038400,,631,4.642857142857143
3700998,5,B001MVWRNO,"Anyone who watches the show Alias, knows how great season 1 was. It was one of the sexiest and most action packed shows to come around in a long time. However, that is also why I had my doubts about season 2. When a show is that good right off the bat, it makes you think that the first season will be hard to top. That wasn't the case with the second season of Alias. It opens up with a bang, and the momentum never stops. You see everything from Sydney working with her mother ( who is supposed to be dead) and the fall of SD-6, to the start of Sydney and Vaughn's relationship.
As a whole, Alias is a sleek, sexy, and action packed spy thriller that is guaranteed to leave you wanting more after each episode. The missions themselves provide for endless action, numerous close calls, and awesome fight sequenes. I also like how the show goes all over the world with the missions. With each mission, comes a new disguise for Sydney, and she looks good no matter what she dresses in!
The acting is top notch. Not only is Jennifer Gardner extremely sexy, but she also provides for great acting and fighting scenes. Victor Garber is amazing s Sydney's dad. He is cold, calculating, and always looks out for himself. Ron Rifkin is amazing as Arvin Sloan, because even though he will make you despise him, he can also be extremely charming and likeable. Michael Vartan is great as Michael Vaughn. The sexual chemistry between him and Jennifer Garner is amazing, and it led to a real life relationship between the two of them. I must say though, one of the funniest and underrated characters on the show is Marshall the tech guy played by Kevin Weisman. Each week we get to see him demonstrate a new invention. The way that he does it will make you laugh. The show's best feature however, is the amount of outstanding cliffhangers. A good percentage of the episodes never have a clear cut ending and unfold slowly over the course of many episodes.
Alias is the most exciting and action packed show that is on right now. The acting and different missions both seperate Alias from the rest. The extras for the season 2 Alias DVD set are great. My favorite feature is the gag-reel that shows many hilarious behind the scenes mishaps. There is also deleted scenes, featurettes, and much more. If you loved the first season, season 2 will amaze you. Definately a must buy!!",1073865600,,2364,4.512820512820513
3700999,5,B001MVWRNO,"After the cliffhanger ending (what else is new for this show?) to season 1, I couldn't stand not knowing the rest of the story and buckled down and bought season 2.  I don't regret it at all.
The story of Sydney as a double agent in SD-6 that began in the first season reaches a stunning climax mid-way through the season that basically changes the whole direction of the series.  The appearence of Sydney's mother in season 1 at the end of final episode becomes an intriguing plot device that leaves the viewer wondering each week which side she really is on.
One of the more interesting aspects of this season is that various sub plots to the main story arc are just as facinating as the main story.  For instance, I thought the story of Sloane and his wife trying to escape from the Alliance was very interesting and added to the depth of his character.  Moreover, Marshall (who usually does a great job as the show's comic relief) gets a two part episode where he goes on a mission with Sydney was another season highlight for me.
In addition, the episode writers this season showed that they were able to handle a gaggle of guest stars and still be able to keep the story moving forward.  The traditional way most television series handle guest stars with the star power of the appearences this season is to have a ""very special"" one part or two part episode in which the guest mega star is allowed to shine.  However, the writers let all of the stars (such as Faye Dunaway, Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater etc.) perfectly compliment the main storyline.  Faye Dunaway's portrayal of a spy hunter in SD-6 on Victor Garber's trail was particularly good in my opinion.
If you are a fan of the series, you have to get this DVD set.  The only people I wouldn't recommend this to is people who haven't seen the first season.  The story won't make too much sense and you'd be missing a lot of the fun of the first season too!",1073692800,,1921,4.45014245014245
3701000,5,B001MVWRNO,"We got the first season of Alias for Christmas, had to stop half way through and buy a surround sound system with a sub woofer - and picked up the second season while we were out.  Season II picks up with the same intensity of the first season.  It's a little deep in the Sci-Fi at times but not so much that it breaks the flow.  The soundtrack is amazing - it will really put your entertainment system to the test.  Sound effects, music, dialog all work together to give you a movie theater experience.  The DVD layout is very easy to understand, smooth transitions and great cuts!
Make sure you have the time before you pop this in - there are few stopping points during the entire collection so be prepared to spend many hours in front of your TV - even pausing for ""Bio-Breaks"" is tough ;-)  I wouldn't want to watch this any other way - this is a series that was MADE for DVD!",1073433600,,881,4.214285714285714
3701001,5,B001MVWRNO,"What can I say about Alias that hasn't already been said? It's exhilarating, moving, heartbreaking, tragic and full of hope. The one thing I won't say about it, however, is that it's unrealistic. Yes, I realize that it sometimes slips over the line between fiction and fantasy, but calling it unrealistic is way too technical.

The truth is, no matter what the writers of Alias write, we (the fans) believe it. Can Sydney really beat up 5 men armed with only a broom? Of course. Because this show's writers and actors/actresses have talent that you rarely see in movies, and never see on television.

The dialogue, coupled with the intensity of emotion that Jennifer Garner and the rest of the cast bring to this show makes it completely believable, if not realistic.

Bottom Line: If you haven't seen this series, buy it immediately. I'm sure that 99 out of 100 people will treasure this box set!

If you have seen this series, buy the DVDs. Even if you already have the episodes on tape, the extras featured in this set are well worth it.

Happy watching!",1073174400,,1057,4.661290322580645
3701002,5,B001MVWRNO,"In this second season it continues after the first season where Sydney comfronts her mother. Soon after shooting Sydney her mother turns herslef into the C.I.A. Sydney is pushed to go get information from her although she despises her and tells herself that her real mom died in a car accident. Despite warnings from her father  to not trust her mom, she starts to not just trust her but love her as well. The episode where the mom is needed in-order to do a mission is the one. Because you get Sydney working with her parents together for the first and only time.
  Another great episode of this season is the one with an appearence by Ethan Hawke. He plays an agent who was captured and doubled by scientist. In a great scene Sydney has to figure out which is the real agent and who to shoot. I know that sounds familiar and you may have seen it before but the way the show handles it is still very cool. Besides Ethan Hawkes appeapence, Faye Dunaway, Rutger Haurer (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Blade Runner) and Christian Slater also apear in other episodes. I liked Quentin Tarantino and Roger Moore's appearences the first season and these are good as well. I can't wait to see who appears in the 3rd season.
  Anyway this season is full of surprises and plot turns. It's very well written, the action is better than what you get from movies and the cast is fantastic. To me Jennifer Garner is the next Julia Roberts but a Julia Roberts that just can't act well but kick ass as well. Michael Vartan (Never Been Kissed) is excellent as well as Sydney's handler and potential b/f. Hell everyone is good in their roles and all of them have intersting characters as well. If Tom Cruise decides to make a Mission Impossible 3, he needs to sit down and watch Alias to get some pointers. Because Alias is a great spy show that the Mission Impossible movies only wish they were as good as.",1073088000,,1891,4.469565217391304
3701003,4,B001MVWRNO,"You know it's a bad day when your Mom shoots you as a prelude to torture. When we last left CIA double agent Sydney (Jennifer Garner), she discovered that her own mother ( the subtle Lena Olen) wasn't dead but was the head of an evil organization that uses black mail and extortion to achieve wealth and world domination.
 Sloan ( the oily Ron Rifkin) the head of the evil faux CIA agency SD-6 that Sydney is spying on with her father (the marvelous Victor Garber) suspects Sydney is a double agent (for the umpteenth time). After murdering his terminally ill wife, Sloan believes his rivals are trying to drive him insane when he gets a mysterious call from his wife's favorite bed and breakfast. When he discovers her dying garden in full bloom he knows someone's trying to ship him out on the next train to Wackyland.  To top off a horrible week for Sydney, one of her best friends is almost assassinated and her CIA handler disappears during a joint mission. Have you caught your breath? That was just the first three episodes of the second season. The manic pace of this series will keep your brain nimble even as your body becomes as round as a potato.
Alias manages to combine elements of the original television series Mission: Impossible, Alfred Hitchcock's suspense films,  the cult series The Prisoner, Felicity  and The X-Files in a series of entertaining (and occasionally absurd) story arcs. Series creator/producer J. J. Abrams has created a series of multilayered stories that continue to keep the audience guessing. It may not be great ""drama"" but it's great spy opera. Jennifer Garner runs from one emotional extreme to another all within the same episode making the series a rollercoaster ride for fans.
Thankfully the McGuffin (a reference to a tool used by Hitchcock in his suspense films. A McGuffin is a story device that moves the drama forward and that's very important to the characters but not clearly defined for the audience) of the first season the Rimbaldi Prophecy doesn't dominate the second season quite as much. While the Rimbaldi Prophecy and all the pieces of that puzzle were interesting, they had become somewhat absurd by the end of the first season. Abram's in his reach to create a mythology as complex as The X-Files exceeded his grasp. While it does figure prominently in the second season, it's less of a driving force than the character relationships and double crosses.
The Complete Second Season has all 22 episodes that aired last year plus some nice extras. The picture quality is very good considering how much data is included on each disc (roughly 5 1/2 hours each). There's some minor compression artifacts but the picture is clean of analog flaws. The  Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is faithfully reproduced and has far more depth than the episodes run on ABC.
The extras are surprisingly good considering the price of the set. There's a featurette on the making of ""The Telling"" , one on the look of the series, as well as a glimpse at the video game . The blooper reel allows an inside glimpse into the series and reminds us that to paraphrase Hitchcock, it's only a television show. Audio commentary from the cast and crew features prominently on four of the more important episodes. I really haven't had a chance to spent much time with the DVD-Rom Scriptscanner but based on the glimpse I did take, it provides a nice companion and comparison piece to the series..
Extra points go to Touchstone for the nicely packaged second season. 2 discs are in each snap case and the cardboard holder somes with a plastic sleeve that makes it look very classy. A few demerits for the annoying Disney habit of force feeding previews to the audience. I find this form of advertising offensive and it's been taken to absurd new heights on the Universal DVDs where you have to watch the advertisements before reaching the main menu. At least Disney does offer the option of skipping the previews (but you have to choose menu as the disc begins) so you can move on to the episode you want to watch.
""Alias: The Second Season"" is an exceptional boxed set for fans. What's fun about seeing this again so soon after the third season is the chance to look back at the carefully planned story arcs. If you haven't seen the first season of the show, I would recommend renting/purchasing the boxed set before moving forward to season two. Although Abrams and the series writers do a good job of summarizing important plot points from season one, there's quite a bit to be missed if you come in on the middle of this story.",1072828800,,4555,4.7101631116687575
3701004,5,B001MVWRNO,"Even if you missed the first season, you will have no reason to miss this one. This season, albiet a lot harder to believe logically, was more entertaining and action packed that the first season and the third (present) season. J.J. Abrams managed to reevent the show two times during the season. From the first episode to the last there is only fantasic entertainment. There is something for everyone: romance, action, adventure, fantasy, mystery. This season managed to have all its episodes be important and well written and acted. Everything always comes full circle while taking us through exciting cliffhangers and challenging plots.",1072656000,,639,5.213592233009709
3701005,5,B001MVWRNO,"I love this show. Each show is like a mini-movie on its own. The show keeps the audience enraptured with great characters, their fast development in each episode, blink of the eye twists and turns in the plot, and cliffhanger endings each show. The only unfortunate thing is if you don't watch the shows in order or if you miss one episode you're likely to be totally lost and confused the next time you tune in. Thankfully the producers of Alias were smart enough to have these DVDs come out with great timliness for new audiences to catch up. For myself, now that I'm caught up in the story, I've been able to continue onto the VCR taped shows of Season 3 and I'm ready to now tune in regularly on Sunday nights and support their ratings.
Special features for collected sets of TV shows are usually lacking and that's pretty much the same here. Yet they do offer quite a bit with bloopers and deleted scenes that are great as well as some behind the scenes features which are always good. Not a fan of director commentaries, but they're also available on certain episodes. One major turning point in the show is the repositioning of the story. To help dumb the show down so that there are no longer the perceived complications and confusion of SD6 missions and CIA countermissions, they turn the Alias world upside down.
I'd love to pick out separate episodes to list as my top three favorites, but seriously, considering this show continues to build on itself and feels like a really long movie, I wouldn't be able to do that. However, I will say that the episode
Marshall goes into the field is pretty hilarious, ""ALLO!"" and especially with the return cameo of the Chinese torture guy.",1072396800,,1689,4.577557755775578
3701006,5,B001MVWRNO,"I have been hooked on Alias since the second episode. Every week I have to watch it or preferably tape it in case someone in my family dares to interrupt my Alias time. I have even chosen Alias over my fiance (which, I might add, did not go over too well!)
With the new DVD releases, I am able to watch the entire series again in order and look for clues I may have missed the first time around. It's also great to be able to skip commercials.
I have heard that Alias isn't doing too well ratings wise but I have no idea why. There isn't really any language or sex issues which makes it the only show I consistantly watch on tv.
The writers, actors and production team are brillant. I hope that Alias stays on the air for a long time to come.",1072137600,,742,4.089041095890411
3701007,5,B001MVWRNO,"First off, kudos to the producers of this show for getting out the complete second season of ""Alias"" out so quickly after the first and pretty much in time for the start of repeats from the show's current third season.  For those of us who came aboard with the celebrated post Super Bowl episode (""What...was...wrong...with...the...black...one""), this has helped fill in the whole back story on Sydney's mom and pop, how Francie became Allison, and the rest of the intrigue from the critically acclaimed ABC series (a way of saying the Nielsen ratings are not in relationship to the quality of the show).  They might have used ""the...black...one"" to reel in new viewers, but ""Alais"" is about so much more than Jennifer Garner in lingerie (or red wigs, or whatever new look they come up with each week).

When last we left double-agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) at the end of the Complete First Season she had just discovered that ""The Man"" was really her mom, Irina Derevko, who is played by Lena Olin.  This casting just underscores the strong supporting cast, which has heavyweights Ron Rifkin (Arvin Sloane) and Victor Garber (Jack Bristow) stealing scenes from all the kiddies right and left.  With Derevko added to the mix along with SD-6 and the Rambaldi artifacts, things are even more convoluted and confusing, which is half the fun.  The characters do not really know what is going on, so why should the audience expect to be in a better position?  The short answer is that they should not, and be challenged by this rewarding series would be a good thing worth treasuring.  The other half of the fun here is the speculation as to what is going on and what might happen next.

While Sydney is having fun with mom and dad (the family that shoots automatic weapons together has successful missions to India together), other members of the supporting cast come into their own, most notably the season's roller coaster ride for Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and the world coming crashing down on Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbley) not once, but twice.  Even Marshall (Kevin Weisman) has his moments of glory, and special recognition goes to Terry O'Quinn as FBI Assistant Director Kendall for being a master of exposition.  Still, I have to admit that the two most compelling characters were Arvin Sloane and Irina Derevko.  As much as Sloane's place in the Alliance matters, both his wife (Amy Irving) and the Rambaldi artifacts matter more, and he finally proves himself a criminal mastermind.  But with Derevko ""Alias"" has its ultimate wildcard, because you know everything out of her life is half-truth and half-lie, and even when the dust is settled from each of her escapades you are still never really clear as to which is which.

It makes perfect sense that at the end of the first season I thought that Sydney cried a lot for somebody that was Jack Bristow's daughter and at the end of the second I was wondering how our heroine was Irina Derevko's daughter.  You have to admit, that in any given episode Sydney cries more than her parents have in their combined life.  I mean for Jack Bristow becoming enraged is cutting off Marshall in the middle of one of his circular speeches.  Still, for those of us going through withdrawal from the demise of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" I have to admit that ""Alias"" helps fill the void, especially with one of the more unique cliffhangers ending this second season as creator Jeffrey Abrams found a creative way of keeping Sydney and Vaughn (Michael Vartan) apart (at least, on camera).  The DVD extras are decent, with outtakes, featurettes, and a few commentary tracks where the cast and crew admire their work.",1072051200,,3667,4.812101910828026
3701008,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias just has to be the greatest show on this planet! It's complex, dizzying, exhilarating, fantastic, and intimate at the same time. The family dynamics of the Bristows (especially with the addition of the perfectly-cast Lena Olin as Sydney's thought-to-be-deceased Russian-spy mom) is compelling, very interesting to watch, and absolutely believable. (Ever notice how much they resemble each other?) The Rambaldi mythology that we had a taste of in the first season is back and we learn more about the prophet and his works. And let us not forget Sloane! Who knows what he's got up his sleeves?!
The action scenes are perfectly set-up and very well-choreographed. The character development, pacing, and overall structure of the show is top-notch, not to mention the talents involved! Victor Garber, anyone?

3701010,5,B001MVWRNO,"Part I: The show
----------------
Yes, that's right, watch at your own peril! This show is so superb that after watching it, you will be forced to judge all other shows by the same standards.
First, its plot lines and story development are among the most organic. Most shows are fresh for only the first season. Soon, their plot lines settle into predictable patterns. Alias keeps everything fresh. You can never be sure what will come next. What you think you know, you don't. Every episode reveals just a few more crisscrossing threads of a gigantic tapestry. What seems like an insignificant side note from half a season ago will come back when you least expect it to deliver the biggest shock of your life. On most shows, the primary cast stays fixed. An established character rarely leaves the show. On the few rare occasions they do, it's a big deal. In the ever mercurial world of Alias, audiences see old, well established characters leave, to be replaced with new invigorating characters. Yet, despite the show's constant metamorphosis, a cohesive theme run through it all so there is no doubt you are still watching the same show. Like a person, this show evolves from season to seasons.
But what is a good story without the cast and crew to bring it to life. Here too, Alias outshines all the rest. Jennifer Garner is absolutely brilliant as Sidney Bristow. It would be so easy for her to fall prey to playing an invulnerable supergirl. Instead, she strikes a masterful balance between Sidney, the girl next door, and Agent Bristow, international ass kicker. It is not her spin kicks but her human struggles which has endeared us all.
Victor Garber, too, deserves many accolades for his portrayal of Jack Bristow, Sidney's father. At a glance, Jack appears to be the strategic, unemotional, calculating tactician. Yet, beneath the veneer lies a tortured father struggling to hold his fragile family together in a world determined to pull them apart. His love for Sidney is undeniable. Yet his circumstances compel him to silence. Only an actor as talented as Victor could rise up to the challenge of embodying the complex subtleties of Jack Bristow. The same is true of Ron Rifkin who plays Arvin Sloane, a man who is mostly evil, and yet has just a shred of humanity buried deep within the chasm of his blackened soul. And who could forget Lena Olin, who played Sidney's mother. Her performances with Victor Garber were absolutely electrifying. Even the guest stars are a veritable list of who's who in the Hollywood community. In two seasons audiences have been blessed by performances from Quentin Terrentino, Terry O Quinn, and Faye Dunaway. The show just wouldn't be the same without such a superb cast. Yet excellence does not stop there, it permeates every aspect of the show.
Unlike most television shows, the production of Alias rivals that of many feature films. Common are the incredible chase sequences, helicopter raids, and pulse pounding martial arts duals. Everything is always kept fresh. For example, many fight choreographies take into account Sidney's surroundings so that she may use objects around her to defeat her enemies. You will just have to see it to believe it.
Part II: The DVD Set
--------------------
The season two DVD comes in a slightly nicer package than Season 1. The graphics designs on the cover and inside shows more sophistication and maturity. Like its predecessor, season 2 comes with all 22 episodes in anamorphic wide screen, with Dolby Digital Surround. The video transfer is crisp and clear, like season 1.
Where the Season 2 DVD set excels is with the extras. First, this DVD set comes with four episodes with commentary. The episodes are:
Phase One, with commentary by JJ Abrams, Jennifer Garner, Greg Grunsberg, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber.
A Dark Turn, with commentary by Ken Olin, and a few others .
Second Double (episode 21) with commentary by Carl Llumbly, Ron Rifkin, Kevin Weissman, and a few I may have missed.
The Telling (episode 22) with commentary by JJ Abrams, among others.
Of the 4 commentary episodes, Second Double was the funniest one. The Telling was perhaps the most informative, because JJ spoke a lot about where he was going with the episode.
Additionally, Commentary for Phase One included a blooper sequence for the fight between Sidney and one of the security guards on the air plane. Commentary for the telling included an alternative scene for Sidney's reaction to her being missing for two years.
Documentary on ""The Telling"" was very extensive, covering everything through post production and music composition. You get an inside look at the major stunts such as Lena Olin jumping off the building and the fight sequence between Sidney and evil Francie. At 45 minutes, it's very good and worth watching.
The Look of Alias segment delves into the costume design and make up for Sidney's countless distinctive looks.
Included are also 7 deleted scenes, some of which interesting, others just so so.
The blooper reel was much improved from Season 1. Season 1 was a bit short. This one was 5 minutes, two minutes longer than season 1. It also included far funnier moments, in my opinion.
There are also four radio interviews with the cast of Alias (Jen, Victor, JJ and Eric).
There are of course some other extras, but they are not really worth mentioning. All in all, this was an excellent package, and well worth your money.",1070409600,,5415,4.886956521739131

After recently buying a new DVD player I was anxious to get started watching something.  I bought ""Alias Season 1"" and ""Six Feet Under"" (which I would also recommend highly).  Anyway, my plan was to watch one episode a week, or at most a couple, so I could make it last.  So I'm thinking I can get through the 22 or so episodes in 10 weeks.  Try 2.
Thats right!  I would watch like three a day.  I was addicted.  Conversations in my house sounded something like this...
""Honey, come eat dinner.""
""No, I'm watching Alias.""
""Honey, help me with the groceries.""
""No, I'm watching Alias.""
""Honey, I'm pregnant.""
""Wow, thats great, we'll talk later, I'm watching Alias.""
I'm really serious.  Every episode would end on such a cliffhanger you had to see at least the beginning of the next episode.  But then the middle was so good you wanted to see how it would develope.  But then another darn cliffhanger and you were locked in the cycle for good.
I can't wait for Season 2.  I pre-ordered it at 3 in the morning because that was a minute after I finished Season 1.  I'm thinking about starting AA (Alias Anonymous) until I can get my fix.",1068595200,,1245,4.431718061674009
3701018,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias is by far the best TV show on the planet, and many people will agree with me when I say that. It is everything that you would expect from the greatest show ever, and more!
This set of DVDs for season 2, was the best season of Alias, much action, espionage and adventure. even a little some, tears but I won't spoil it for you.
If you don't know what Alias is, you are missing out. Go to ABC.com, there you can see information about the show etctera.
The DVDs include special deleated scences, cometaries from the cast, the whole 22-jampacked season 2 on 6 discs.
Belive me when I say this, you will regret yourself if you do not buy this.",1068249600,,644,4.2439024390243905
3701019,5,B001MVWRNO,"Season 2 smoothly picked up from where the previous season ended - the meeting between Sydney & her mom.  Some personalities were given more depth & character in this series, such as Jack, Dorevko, & to a point Sloane.  They are all human, with their own strengths & flaws.  Some characters also present in Season 1 were given more active role like Will, Francine & Stark.  Of course, not to mention the exciting development in the various relationships among our characters, which ended in a great 'twist' in this season's last episode.  Truly a cliffhanger, which leaves its viewers anxiously waiting for Season 3 to be shown on air.
The only drawback in watching this series in TV is the presence of commercials, which come during the most exciting cuts.  I highly recommend to view this series in video, for non-stop viewing.  Surely, I will watch all episodes again as soon as I get hold of my Season 2 video.",1067385600,,914,4.675
3701020,5,B001MVWRNO,hey there.. Alias is the first show on television that I actually take off work to watch.  Congrats to JJ Abrams and his amazing writing and to all the cast members for allowing JJ to express his skills.,1065571200,,203,4.342105263157895
3701021,5,B001MVWRNO,"I think we all agree that alias is the best show in history, of course it's closely tied with buffy and roswell!! but what the show does not have in common with buffy and roswell is a soundtrack!!! Come on guys produce an alias soundtrack!!!!!",1064880000,,243,4.4222222222222225
3701022,5,B001MVWRNO,"Season two started out normally enough. Syndey Bristow is a double agent for the CIA working to take down SD-6, an organization she joined believing that they were part of the CIA but in fact was pure evil.
Jennifer Garner as Sydney makes you believe in the set-up. Victor Garber, used better here than in the first season, is terrific as Sydney's fellow double agent dad. The addition of Lena Olin as Sydney's long thought dead mother was a stroke of pure genius. The scenes between Garber and Olin are electric.
Things went along very well for about half the season, then everything changed. In one episode, the entire writer's bible for the series had to be re-written. It's surprising they even kept the series title. Just as the shock value of that wore off, they did it again in the season finale with a couple lines at the end.
This season is not to be missed for fans of the series, the stars, or of good acting.",1064620800,,920,4.482142857142857
3701023,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias is just... amazing. It's genius, it's [kickin], smart, mind-blowing, intense, and mesmerizing and with the elements of glamour and fun and humore... and if you're addicted to this show--- it's life.
Right when you think you've got Sydney's spy life and family figured out- everything twists around and things go the other way. JJ Abrams is truly brilliant!",1062115200,,362,5.1525423728813555
3701024,3,B001MVWRNO,"Back for it's second season Alias continues on with the great writing and mostly good plots(it's still somewhat comic book but a lot of fun). Sydney has now found that her mother is still alive and wanting to switch sides (her ex- husband Jack Bristow seems to almost pathologically hate her). That's one of the better subplots this season with quite a few twists and turns (you never know what's coming up next)Later in the season SD-6 is finally shut down (all in one episode, which I missed the first time around, which was really confusing to me). The season had a lot of odd turns (3rd season looks like it will really start out strangely)and several interesting guest appearances by actors/ actresses I didn't expect to see on TV including Rutger Hauer, Faye Dunaway and Christian Slater.",1060646400,,794,4.760869565217392
3701025,5,B001MVWRNO,"ALIAS is one of the smartest, most intricate shows I have ever seen. In fact, it is THE most intelligent show out there. I missed the entire first season but was there for the season premiere and though I was confused at first, soon became utterly enthralled and a very dedicated fan.
1) The cast is incredible. All of them are absolutely perfect for their roles, not to mention that some of them are definitely eye-candy (ahem Michael Vartan ahem)
2) The plot line is something like you won't believe. You think you know something?
You don't.
You think you have it all figured out?
You haven't.
The only thing that you will figure out is that J.J. Abrams WANTS you to figure out and that's it. Think all you want, stretch your brain as far as it can you and you can't even begin to uncover what this show has in store.
3) Even if you don't want to think, this show is great just for watching. The action, the dialogue, the chemistry, the costumes, the different languages, scenery, and balance between professional and personal life (and the lines that cross them) are absolutely wonderful.
4) Every single episode ends in a cliff hanger.
Especially the season finales....",1060041600,,1173,4.617224880382775
3701026,5,B001MVWRNO,"Alias is the second best show on television, second only to 24.  The nicely intricate plot twists and gripping action all help to contribute what a fantastic show this is but what really makes this show so special are the performances from a fantastic cast.  In particular, it's the complex and layered relationship between Sydney and Jack and Irina that is really the heart of the show.  That's what the show seems to be about.  That and Sloane's obsessive search for this ramboldi device.  This show has made me fallen for Jennifer Garner.  I love her.  She's amazing. Victor Garber takes what could be a very unlikable character and brings the humanity out of Jack Bristow making him sympathetic.  Lena Olin is wonderful in a very complex role in which we're not sure whether she can be trusted or not but we want to believe her because Olin is so good.  The rest of the series regulars Michael Varten, Bradley Cooper, Ron Rifkin, Carl Lumbley and Kevin Weissman as the lovable but dorky and goofy Marshall, are all exceptional.  This is the second best show on television and has become one of my all time favorites as well.",1058832000,,1128,4.651515151515151
3701027,5,B001MVWRNO,"If you are a true Alias fan, you will need the Season 2 DVD set. Season 2 had so many great plot twists and interesting moments that youll be able over and over again.
Alias is an outstanding show, combining espionage with relationship drama with a splash of humor. You can sit back and enjoy it or get into the deep subplots and spend days wondering and analyzing what something really means.
Season 2 also just got 11 well-deserved Emmy Nominations. Congratulations to the cast and crew of Alias on an outstanding year.",1058745600,,521,4.612903225806452
3701028,5,B001MVWRNO,"If you haven't watch Alias, I can honestly say that you are missing out. Although it may be hard to catch on, after watching a few episodes in a row (like how I did in the middle of season 1) You'll catch on. The show is breathe taking and amazing. There is no other show that is as compelling as this one. The acting, writing, directing, editing, special effects, make up, costume, settings, etc...... is the best for any tv show. It truly is amazing! A must for everyone! Hopefully it'll be out for many more seasons to come.",1058659200,,527,4.333333333333333

The season starts with Vaughn missing and presumed dead, Will trying to adjust to his new life in the know, and Sydney tied to a chair seeing her presumed dead mother, who is ""The Man"". In the middle of the season, Vaughn and Sydney finally kiss, Will has a job with the CIA, and Francie is killed by an evil twin. At the end of the season, Sydney has been missing for two years, Vaughn has married someone else, Will has been stabbed by Francie, and evil Francie-clone is dead...by Sydney's hands.

If you haven't seen it--or if you missed something (and trust me, I'm sure you did!)--buy these CDs and have a fabulous time!  With romance, action, drama, humor, mystery and suspense, there is truly something in this show for everyone!

Luckily, it will be around for a third season, and hopefully many more. This will be a must-have to add to your collection, and it will be a great Christmas gift!
