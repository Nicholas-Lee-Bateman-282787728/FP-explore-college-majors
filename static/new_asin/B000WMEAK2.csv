2987116,3,B000WMEAK2,"I saw this during a special preview in Boston last year and really thought it was a fantastic behind-the-scenes journey with the band during their last tour. The film has a great 8mm/home movie aesthetic, which I thought was really strong. There are mostly tail-ends and bits of songs, keeping the focus on the band during off hours (I hope you guys are planning a DBTT concert DVD as well?), and these stage moments are interesting in the context of their traveling. There are many great scenes of what fills the time between gigs: the endless interviews, playing games, writing, etc. If you want to spend time on tour with a great band and you enjoy a cinema verite look, check this out. **other reviewers have noted that there is a longer version with a bonus concert disc.

2987120,5,B000WMEAK2,"There is one problem with this DVD set and one problem only: the marketing. It is packaged as a documentary with a bonus concert.  It SHOULD have been packaged as a concert with a bonus documentary.  Because the concert is the meat of this. For my money the sound, the showmanship, and the virtuoso performances captured here are better than Live by the Sea, better than There and Then, better even than Familiar to Millions. (Also making this better than FtM is the lack of those pretentious ""visuals"" inserts.)  Oasis is the greatest [live] band in the world and it has never been on greater display than it is here. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sound is amazing, and the music is Oasis. What more could you want?

I wish they had done one of these for Be Here Now and Heathen Chemistry, but oh well, I'll take what I can get.  Also a companion CD for this one would be nice.

(I also admit I got kinda sick during ""Rock 'n' Roll Star,"" as the director uses a nonstop series of pans and zooms with increasing tempo to convey a frantic energy, to nauseating effect. If you have a sensitive stomach you might want to listen that one with your eyes closed.)

That said, the documentary is also very enjoyable, although perhaps too moody, atmospheric, and abstract for the tastes of some.  For a really good time, turn on the commentary track.

2987124,3,B000WMEAK2,"In Spring, 2005, Oasis released its 6th studio album ""Don't Believe the Truth"", and immediately went on the road for what seemed to be a never-ending tour around the world in support of the album. The tour eventually wound up a full year later. This DVD is the chronicle of that tour.

""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"" is split up in 2 DCDs. On DVD 1 (105 min.) it brings a documentary of what it's like to be on the road for such a long tour, and if there is one word that I can think of, it's ""slug"", as in: it's a slug to be touring. The documentary shows the band going from the hotel or the tour bus to yet another airport and another concert venue. The guys play cards a lot, do endless media interviews and other promotions, and generally do a lot of waiting around. Fun is different, it seems to me. The best part here is the 10-15 min. Q&A bonus at the end with Noel, where he takes questions from the audience (not sure where or who), answering questions like what he thinks his most Beatles-esque song is (that would be ""All Around the World"", according to Noel).

On DVD2 (90 min.), it brings the full show of Oasis' home-coming show in Manchester in July 2005. It sounds great, but the set is heavy on tracks from the mediocre ""Don't Believe the Truth"" and even worse, the setlist is simply too predictable. With as rich a back-catalogue as Oasis has, surely the band could've uncovered some better songs to play? I saw Oasis twice on this tour, and the setlist was virtually identical. As to the bonus materials, there are 12 clips from fans who were at the show and used their cell phone or digicam to prove it. Not surprisingly, these clips are virtually unwatchable due to the poor sound and/or video quality. In all, ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"" is pretty much a letdown for me. If you want to watch Oasis at its best live, I would much rather recommend 1996's ""There and Then"" concert video, which is miles better than this.",1199059200,10,1933,4.351800554016621

2987126,5,B000WMEAK2,"""Lord Slow Me Down"" is a double disc set, the first disc contains the documentary, and follows the band throughout their tour in Europe and The U.S and finally ending up in Japan. The film shows many great insights to the inner workings of OASIS, long gone are those days where Liam and Noel would succumb to their anger by throwing chairs at each other, but there is one scene which shows them arguing in a restaurant. The second disc is the concert in Manchester, which is very similar to the 2001 DVD ""Familiar To Millions"" It is great to see the band in top form again, and nearly five years later they still have what it takes to rock a crowd, and the concert is worth it just to see how crazy the crowd gets, but as always it's all about the music.",1196899200,2,754,4.243055555555555

2987128,3,B000WMEAK2,"I've been an Oasis fan since 'Morning Glory was released and even own all of their singles/B-sides, so I was really looking forward to this tour documentary. But I was really disappointed in the film. It's boring. If you're not watching the band do awful interviews between shows, you're watching them play a damn board game or some other time killer. With all the footage the director shot, this was the best he could put together? They were on this tour for a year, but in the film, you don't get that sense of a year-long tour at all; there's never an indication of what city/country the band is in, or the dates of the shows. The fact that it's all in black and white doesn't help. Oh, and the handheld-NYPD Blue-style technique gets old really fast.

Now on to the good: The Special Features:
1. The audio commentary by the band is pretty humorous, especially having Noel and Liam taking fun-hearted jabs at each other, while watching each other on screen.
2. The Q&A between Noel and fans is pretty intriguing, as Noel is in a great mood, answers all questions honestly and thorough, all while cracking jokes. It's only audio (with more footage from the film), which is a bummer, but it's still very good.
3. The concert on Disc 2, of course, is a great feature. And it's not in black and white!

So if you're a huge fan of the band, you like audio commentaries, and want (another?) live concert of them, then this DVD is for you.",1194998400,6,1436,4.477099236641221
2987129,2,B000WMEAK2,"...the best thing  about this DVD is the cover artwork...the second  best is the ""bonus disc"" of a live show (which isn't even a full show unless Oasis plays for  1:15 when  they fill a stadium). and the third best thing is that I  don't have to watch the documentary ""film""  on  disc one ever again.
Its a mess...a disjointed faux art film.  I  love  black  and  white and a good documentary but this isn't artistic or good. Honestly I don't  know  where to start..it barely passes as bonus footage on an extas...to be the main focus of the release is staggering.  They  could have used much more performance footage on the documentary to keep things a bit more interesting  for  one.  Nothing is revealed in the documentary of  much interest  ...Liam is obviously an Ahole...Noel is talented and much less tortured and this plays out over and  over in the same scenes in  different  cities...blah blah snore snore.  By far the best musician in  the group is Zack Starkey the drummer (who also  plays with the Who) and we  never hear a single word from him...oh  well perhaps he knew...and  now you do too!",1194652800,11,1107,4.528205128205128
2987130,5,B000WMEAK2,"I just picked up this DVD the day it was released.  Alot of people were worried about the US version not being the same as the UK.  No worries for fans, Amazon's information is wrong.  The US version has the full (unedited) 95 minute version of the documentary and does include the bonus DVD of the Manchester 2005 concert.  I was lucky to see the documentary at a screening almost a year ago, but it was an edited version used for promotion and TV.  The full version flows a little better, although I was overall somewhat bored with it, I think it was the director's (Baillie Walsh) intent to perhaps capture some of the monotony of being on the road day after day.  I was hoping to see the Gallaghers tear things up a bit more, but in truth their wild antics have left them and you see more mature (and perhaps boring) sensibility towards life on the road.  That being said though, it is still fabulous for die-hard Oasis fans espescially footage of gem, andy, and noel playing ideas on acoustic guitar.  The black & white give the documentary a classic feel, without being pretentious.  What makes it worth buying (it's readily available for download, albeit illegally, on youtube and fan sites at least for now) is the commentary track done by Gem, Noel, Liam, Andy, Baillie, and a few others.  The commentary audio track is available for the entire film, and there is where the Gallaghers' humor and personality shines through, where as the film itself didn't seem to catch that.  There is alot more insight into why the band loves to do what they do, after all these years.  As far as bonus features, there's also the an audio Q&A with Noel that's quite revealing in his attitudes towards Be Here Now, touring, and future plans.  The thing that makes this DVD 5 stars (from the 4 it would've had with just the documentary) is the bonus DVD featuring the band playing live in Manchester from July 2nd, 2005.  It is the same that was broadcasted on British TV, but the picture is clearer and the sound is much improved, espescially when using the 5.1 surround mix.  Some have complained that Liam's voice is a little low in the mix, I would agree, but overall the quality of the recording (and the video for that matter) is the best of any Oasis live concert I've heard, including the previously released Familiar to Millions concert.  The concert is absolutely stunning and the lighting and camera angles really get at the expirience.  It's good to see Oasis releasing a DVD of a show from the DBTT tour, because is includes Turn up the Sun, Lyla, Mucky Fingers, Importance of Beind Idle, etc., this is simply classic material .  Considering Oasis could've waited and released these DVDs separately, for 20 bucks each, it's really an amazing buy.  If anyone ever needs convincing as to what makes Oasis great, just show them this concert and play ""Rock n' Roll Star"".  Unbelievable!",1194393600,13,2887,4.623529411764705
2987131,4,B000WMEAK2,"This Dvd pretty much covers: Radio/magazine interviews, before and after concerts, as well as days in between concerts during the DBTT tour. Around 98% of the movie is shot in black n white and has a slight amateur feel that only makes this dvd feel fresh and nature compared to being over produced. The dvd unfolds telling it as it is, without feeling like they put on an act in front of the camera. My only complaint is i wish they cut back on the song clips they used or shorten them as they were kinda of a bore in between. Overall i found the Dvd very entertaining, if your expecting fighting and tons of drunk moments then look elsewhere. This is a realistic, down to earth look at what most bands go through on tour.

The second Dvd feature the concert in Manchester and like another poster commented feels like a recording of familar to millions.",1194307200,2,854,4.439490445859873
2987132,5,B000WMEAK2,"The film itself is fantastic - a real look behind the scenes of one of the best rock n' roll bands of all time. There are some hilarious moments which include Liam dancing and some classic and memorable interviews. The 2-disc DVD also has a live concert from 2005 in Manchester which was a part of the ""Don't Believe The Truth"" tour.  If you've purchased either""Familiar to Millions"", ""There and Then"" or ""Live by the Sea"", you'll notice the Manchester concert is edited in the same way.  The concert was packed and Liam and Noel tear it up.  I would buy this dvd FOR SURE. You're getting both a killer documentary and a rockin' show for a very good price.",1194220800,3,656,4.45
2987133,5,B000WMEAK2,"Despite what Amazon says the Oasis fans in the US are getting the same 2 disc version as the UK. You won't need to import a PAL version or NTSC version from another country so enough with the low scores. Here is the press release confirming the same exact version as the UK

OASIS
Lord Don't Slow Me Down
Big Brother/Hip-O/UMe
November 6, 2007 on DVD

What happens when a film maker follows one of the world's biggest bands on a year long world tour? What happens when the film maker is granted unique access to that band, is present for the ups and downs, the moments of greatness and the periods of the same interview in 10 different languages in as many days? What happens when that band is Oasis, travelling across 26 countries on their biggest world tour to date playing to a total of over 2 million people?

The answer is Lord Don't Slow Me Down (Big Brother/Hip-O/UMe), a double DVD set that not only gives you the definitive feature length documentary seen in selected cinemas last year, but also the option of voice over commentaries from the band, a Noel Gallagher Q & A session with fans from New York City, out takes from the film, and a second 90 minute bonus disc capturing the band's homecoming show at the City of Manchester Stadium together with footage sent in by fans from around the world who attended that show. If you wanted to know what the members of Oasis make of their lives on tour and their audience, then the answers are on these two discs.

Directed by Baillie Walsh who has previously worked with Massive Attack (he made 'Safe From Harm'), Spiritualized, New Order and Kylie's Slow, and is now working on a film with Daniel Craig, this DVD set is a compendium of Oasis entertainment par excellence.

Lord Don't Slow Me Down contents:

Disc One:
Feature length documentary tour film 'Lord Don't Slow Me Down' in stereo and surround sound.  Bonus audio commentary - Noel, Liam, Andy and Gem guide you through the film with their recollections of the tour.  A Noel Gallagher Q&A session with fans runs alongside out-takes from the film.

Bonus Disc:
Oasis live at City of Manchester Stadium on 2nd July 2005 - sixteen classic tracks shot in HD with stereo and surround sound.  Bonus Disc also features unique footage and pictures sent in by fans who attended the concert.
Lord Don't Slow Me Down will be released on November 6, 2007.

Oasis is currently preparing a brand new album for release in 2008.",1193961600,10,2430,4.576036866359447

2987135,5,B000WMEAK2,"I was fortunate enough to catch a viewing of this DVD several months ago and it is superb.  It shows a side of Oasis that the fans don't get to see and after looking at some of the comments and ratings for the DVD, the fans probably don't deserve to see this side of Oasis.  For years the media has portrayed these guys as drunks, idiots, rude, etc...with this release we get to see Oasis as human beings.  Instead of just getting snippets of an interview in which Liam Gallagher tells a reporter that he is going to go ""kick someone in the n*$%"" in order to get some attention, we get the whole picture and see the sarcasm in Liam's gestures and get a feel for the annoyance of being asked the same stupid repetitive questions for the past 13 years.  I thank Oasis for sharing their lives on the road with us and to those who are criticizing this DVd for whatever reason, either get on the bus or go *%^# yourself in the bushes.

3221626,2,B000WMEAK2,"...the best thing  about this DVD is the cover artwork...the second  best is the ""bonus disc"" of a live show (which isn't even a full show unless Oasis plays for  1:15 when  they fill a stadium). and the third best thing is that I  don't have to watch the documentary ""film""  on  disc one ever again.
Its a mess...a disjointed faux art film.  I  love  black  and  white and a good documentary but this isn't artistic or good. Honestly I don't  know  where to start..it barely passes as bonus footage on an extas...to be the main focus of the release is staggering.  They  could have used much more performance footage on the documentary to keep things a bit more interesting  for  one.  Nothing is revealed in the documentary of  much interest  ...Liam is obviously an Ahole...Noel is talented and much less tortured and this plays out over and  over in the same scenes in  different  cities...blah blah snore snore.  By far the best musician in  the group is Zack Starkey the drummer (who also  plays with the Who) and we  never hear a single word from him...oh  well perhaps he knew...and  now you do too!",1194652800,11,1107,4.528205128205128
3221627,5,B000WMEAK2,"I just picked up this DVD the day it was released.  Alot of people were worried about the US version not being the same as the UK.  No worries for fans, Amazon's information is wrong.  The US version has the full (unedited) 95 minute version of the documentary and does include the bonus DVD of the Manchester 2005 concert.  I was lucky to see the documentary at a screening almost a year ago, but it was an edited version used for promotion and TV.  The full version flows a little better, although I was overall somewhat bored with it, I think it was the director's (Baillie Walsh) intent to perhaps capture some of the monotony of being on the road day after day.  I was hoping to see the Gallaghers tear things up a bit more, but in truth their wild antics have left them and you see more mature (and perhaps boring) sensibility towards life on the road.  That being said though, it is still fabulous for die-hard Oasis fans espescially footage of gem, andy, and noel playing ideas on acoustic guitar.  The black & white give the documentary a classic feel, without being pretentious.  What makes it worth buying (it's readily available for download, albeit illegally, on youtube and fan sites at least for now) is the commentary track done by Gem, Noel, Liam, Andy, Baillie, and a few others.  The commentary audio track is available for the entire film, and there is where the Gallaghers' humor and personality shines through, where as the film itself didn't seem to catch that.  There is alot more insight into why the band loves to do what they do, after all these years.  As far as bonus features, there's also the an audio Q&A with Noel that's quite revealing in his attitudes towards Be Here Now, touring, and future plans.  The thing that makes this DVD 5 stars (from the 4 it would've had with just the documentary) is the bonus DVD featuring the band playing live in Manchester from July 2nd, 2005.  It is the same that was broadcasted on British TV, but the picture is clearer and the sound is much improved, espescially when using the 5.1 surround mix.  Some have complained that Liam's voice is a little low in the mix, I would agree, but overall the quality of the recording (and the video for that matter) is the best of any Oasis live concert I've heard, including the previously released Familiar to Millions concert.  The concert is absolutely stunning and the lighting and camera angles really get at the expirience.  It's good to see Oasis releasing a DVD of a show from the DBTT tour, because is includes Turn up the Sun, Lyla, Mucky Fingers, Importance of Beind Idle, etc., this is simply classic material .  Considering Oasis could've waited and released these DVDs separately, for 20 bucks each, it's really an amazing buy.  If anyone ever needs convincing as to what makes Oasis great, just show them this concert and play ""Rock n' Roll Star"".  Unbelievable!",1194393600,13,2887,4.623529411764705
3221628,4,B000WMEAK2,"This Dvd pretty much covers: Radio/magazine interviews, before and after concerts, as well as days in between concerts during the DBTT tour. Around 98% of the movie is shot in black n white and has a slight amateur feel that only makes this dvd feel fresh and nature compared to being over produced. The dvd unfolds telling it as it is, without feeling like they put on an act in front of the camera. My only complaint is i wish they cut back on the song clips they used or shorten them as they were kinda of a bore in between. Overall i found the Dvd very entertaining, if your expecting fighting and tons of drunk moments then look elsewhere. This is a realistic, down to earth look at what most bands go through on tour.

The second Dvd feature the concert in Manchester and like another poster commented feels like a recording of familar to millions.",1194307200,2,854,4.439490445859873
3221629,5,B000WMEAK2,"The film itself is fantastic - a real look behind the scenes of one of the best rock n' roll bands of all time. There are some hilarious moments which include Liam dancing and some classic and memorable interviews. The 2-disc DVD also has a live concert from 2005 in Manchester which was a part of the ""Don't Believe The Truth"" tour.  If you've purchased either""Familiar to Millions"", ""There and Then"" or ""Live by the Sea"", you'll notice the Manchester concert is edited in the same way.  The concert was packed and Liam and Noel tear it up.  I would buy this dvd FOR SURE. You're getting both a killer documentary and a rockin' show for a very good price.",1194220800,3,656,4.45
3221630,5,B000WMEAK2,"Despite what Amazon says the Oasis fans in the US are getting the same 2 disc version as the UK. You won't need to import a PAL version or NTSC version from another country so enough with the low scores. Here is the press release confirming the same exact version as the UK

OASIS
Lord Don't Slow Me Down
Big Brother/Hip-O/UMe
November 6, 2007 on DVD

What happens when a film maker follows one of the world's biggest bands on a year long world tour? What happens when the film maker is granted unique access to that band, is present for the ups and downs, the moments of greatness and the periods of the same interview in 10 different languages in as many days? What happens when that band is Oasis, travelling across 26 countries on their biggest world tour to date playing to a total of over 2 million people?

The answer is Lord Don't Slow Me Down (Big Brother/Hip-O/UMe), a double DVD set that not only gives you the definitive feature length documentary seen in selected cinemas last year, but also the option of voice over commentaries from the band, a Noel Gallagher Q & A session with fans from New York City, out takes from the film, and a second 90 minute bonus disc capturing the band's homecoming show at the City of Manchester Stadium together with footage sent in by fans from around the world who attended that show. If you wanted to know what the members of Oasis make of their lives on tour and their audience, then the answers are on these two discs.

Directed by Baillie Walsh who has previously worked with Massive Attack (he made 'Safe From Harm'), Spiritualized, New Order and Kylie's Slow, and is now working on a film with Daniel Craig, this DVD set is a compendium of Oasis entertainment par excellence.

Lord Don't Slow Me Down contents:

Disc One:
Feature length documentary tour film 'Lord Don't Slow Me Down' in stereo and surround sound.  Bonus audio commentary - Noel, Liam, Andy and Gem guide you through the film with their recollections of the tour.  A Noel Gallagher Q&A session with fans runs alongside out-takes from the film.

Bonus Disc:
Oasis live at City of Manchester Stadium on 2nd July 2005 - sixteen classic tracks shot in HD with stereo and surround sound.  Bonus Disc also features unique footage and pictures sent in by fans who attended the concert.

Oasis is currently preparing a brand new album for release in 2008.",1193961600,10,2430,4.576036866359447

3221632,5,B000WMEAK2,"I was fortunate enough to catch a viewing of this DVD several months ago and it is superb.  It shows a side of Oasis that the fans don't get to see and after looking at some of the comments and ratings for the DVD, the fans probably don't deserve to see this side of Oasis.  For years the media has portrayed these guys as drunks, idiots, rude, etc...with this release we get to see Oasis as human beings.  Instead of just getting snippets of an interview in which Liam Gallagher tells a reporter that he is going to go ""kick someone in the n*$%"" in order to get some attention, we get the whole picture and see the sarcasm in Liam's gestures and get a feel for the annoyance of being asked the same stupid repetitive questions for the past 13 years.  I thank Oasis for sharing their lives on the road with us and to those who are criticizing this DVd for whatever reason, either get on the bus or go *%^# yourself in the bushes.

8224154,3,B000WMEAK2,"**Review originally appeared at https://midnighttosix.wordpress.com

Its been over a decade since Oasis commercial and creative peak, so releasing a documentary from the groups 2005/6 World Tour seems like a curious move  like documenting the Rolling Stones on The Steel Wheels tour. Still, watching the Gallagher brothers go through a litany of fistfights, drugs, alcohol, and slagging off other bands has always been fun, so why not film it? Oddly enough, director Baillie Walsh misses that side of the band in Lord Dont Slow Me Down. Perhaps everyone behaved for the cameras, or maybe the band are growing up and would rather be known for their music than tabloid fodder. Fair enough if thats the case, but its hard to defend the merits of the film when nothing fascinating happens. Instead, we follow them through a seemingly never-ending series of hotel rooms, buses, planes, banal questions from radio hosts, backstage dressing rooms, and stadium stages. Its interesting to watch for Oasis fans (and judging from the size of the venues they play, there are still a ton of them out there), and the Gallagher brothers do create some good moments and spew a few fine quotes, but as a tour documentary, it doesnt go anywhere that Radioheads Meeting People Is Easy didn't already go in 1998. The second disc is a sixteen-song live set from a 2005 stadium gig in Manchester. The songs run the gamut from old hits to new album tracks, and a cover of The Whos My Generation thrown in at the end. The band plays like a tight unit, and the crowd eats it all up with gusto, proving that, although theyll probably never generate as much raw excitement as they did in the mid-90s, Oasis are quite good at being a professional stadium-rock group.",1451347200,,1738,4.828859060402684
8224155,5,B000WMEAK2,Whats not to like about them.  Except that the brothers can't get along to make new music.  What a shame.  Liked this one very much.,1372636800,,132,4.2
8224156,5,B000WMEAK2,I flew from the States to Manchester to see this gig and it was a blast! great concert and great dvd!,1354924800,,101,3.857142857142857
8224157,1,B000WMEAK2,"Sorry to my fellow Oasis fans, but this is an awful product.  The only thing I can find slightly interesting between both disks is, well, not much.  The band is infamous for their lack of charisma on stage, and it shows.  The crowd have all the energy here.  Oasis writes incredible, anthemic music, but on stage, they are mannequins.  Off stage they are cartoonish foul mouthed wanna be thugs.  The pretentious attitudes grow old after 10 minutes.  After 20, I wonder why I even like this band.  Well, it's because they have an amazing talent for making incredible albums.  Calling a band a ""studio band"" is taken as an insult, but I don't think it should be.  When they're in the studio, they capture lightning in a bottle every time.  On stage...meh.  What was the point of the ""behind the scenes"" footage?  Was that shot and directed by a twelve year old?  It went absolutely nowhere.  Worse than a home movie of someone's family.  SAVE YOUR MONEY for the next Oasis CD, which there better be another one of, because so far ""Beady Eye"" sounds like recycled ""yeahs.""",1296691200,3,1069,4.6063829787234045
8224158,5,B000WMEAK2,"This DVD of a live Oasis concert has got to be one of the greatest of all time!  I love this band anyway but this video footage, the sound quality, etc. is fantastic!  And the documentary is so much fun to watch as well.  We love this DVD and play it quite often ... what a band!",1293062400,,279,3.8596491228070176
8224159,5,B000WMEAK2,"The Gallagher brothers are a truly talented pair, especially Noel, who wrote much of Oasis' music. Who knows what it was like growing up in the Gallagher household? You get some inkling from this documentary, especially with Liam, who comes across as a world-class ass. That's no secret, but this movie brings it out. Noel is quieter and more social. The viewer feels sympathy for him since he was the one who made Oasis what it was. Yet Liam acts as if he is the only star in this immensely talented group. Oh, well, it's history now, and this very well made documentary captures them at their height of their abilities and at the height of Liam's arrogance and self-destructiveness.",1285977600,2,684,4.708333333333333
8224160,5,B000WMEAK2,"This is one of the most entertaining behind the scenes documentaries I've ever seen. Even though they are no longer together (although I argue this is a good thing cause now we get albums from Noel's solo work AND Liam's new band...making it 2 times the amount of Gallagher greatness!""), Oasis will always be the greatest band of my generation. This DVD proves why. It's filled with fantastic music plus laugh out loud moments (the Tom Cruise bashing was worth it on its own). If u aren't an Oasis fan, this is still worth your time, but if you're a fan of the boys, it's an absolute must. I give it 10 stars (on a 5 star scale)! Long live the Gallaghers!!",1282867200,2,656,4.385245901639344
8224161,4,B000WMEAK2,"Oh Man, do i enjoy this DVD set!! Picked it up the other day, on the fly, just ""in the mood"" for some Oasis. Opened it up and decided to watch the concert footage first (disc two) - instantly knew I made the right choice to purchase this one. The Manchester concert has got to be one of the best filmed concert of the past 10 years! Great shots of the band, great sound quality, and the guys are performing at the top of their game (one of those great shows where you can tell the band is having a great time).

Move on to the documentary ""Lord Dont Slow Me Down"" on disc one, time to see what happens on the road, behind the scenes with these characters, I use the term ""charators"" cause these guys (Gallagher brothers) do have personality. They are obviously not ashamed to say they love the life their leading (life in a massive rock band), towards the end of the tour (and film) you can tell they are getting worn down, but who wouldn't? But beneath the surface you can just get that feeling that they're doing what they love. And, there in lies the appeal of Oasis, they ENJOY what they do, appreciate the fans, and have a great time (but take their craft seriously).

If your a fan of Oasis, this will not let you down. If your new to Oasis, check this out, see what all the fuzz has been about for the past 15 years. It's a Great Documentary and a fantastic concert film all rolled into one package.",1244851200,,1406,4.223048327137547
