8220204,1,B0000TAYUM,"This is an absolutely horrible amateur production. It is more like a home movie and I can't believe they are actually selling it. As far as the flamenco work-it's disgraceful. These individuals are not qualified to teach or even perform. Please do your research if you really want to learn flamenco. Flamenco has fast, clean footwork; strong arms and NO castanets. Castanets are used solely in Spanish folk dances. Their footwork and timing is completely off and their arm work is very sloppy. Also, the women in this video should have taken notice of the fact that their skirt goes WELL ABOVE their thigh quite a few times. A true flamenco dancer never exposes herself.  Please watch Carlos Saura's ""Flamenco"" if you want to see true flamenco. You can also find some scenes from the movie on various sites on the internet if you are unable to find the movie. I did not buy this DVD, I noticed it on a library shelf and was curious to see how it would portray flamenco since it is quite misrepresented.",1188345600,,1002,4.629213483146067
8220205,1,B0000TAYUM,"The people who put this together are students, and I have seen many other students better than these people. They have no technique and certainly no style. They spend about 15 minutes to show some basic footsteps and then the rest of the video is clips of them doing their gigs!

You got to have some nerve making a video like this. The distributor should pull this off the shelves and tell these people to go take some lessons.

This is what I call an abuse of the beautiful art of flamenco.

PS: I didn't buy this, I rented it from Netflix thinking it was a flamenco guitar instruction video.",1132444800,21,594,4.381818181818182

8220207,5,B0000TAYUM,"My sister and I  got this for fun.  We tried it and  actually were able to put on a performance in one month.  I  have come to love  Learn Flamenco, especially for those of us who are not professional dancers and need to begin at the beginning. Eva Amador gives easey to follow, precise instructions.  I now want to take some classes and improve my ability.  My sister and I learned Flamenco and are happy about it.",1127433600,5,415,4.298701298701299
8220208,1,B0000TAYUM,"This DVD is not much better than your average homemade video.  If you are serious about learning flamenco, do not buy this.  Go to the more reputable flamenco websites instead.  This DVD is a waste of money - really amateurish photography, editing, lighting... Yes, the dance is real but the instruction is very poor.  You may learn a Tango but go to a real instructor.  Don't learn it off this DVD.",1124928000,10,399,4.563380281690141
8220209,1,B0000TAYUM,"Don't waste your money! PLEASE! If I had the opportunity, I would not give this dvd any stars. Not to sound so emotional but this is horrible! What a rip off!",1104105600,20,158,4.129032258064516
