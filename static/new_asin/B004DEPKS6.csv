8425211,5,B004DEPKS6,"One of the best films I've seen in years. An amazing story of the intersecting of the Olympics, Nazi Germany, and a Jewish high-jumper named Gretel Bergmann. Based on a true story. German with English subtitles, but I speak no German, and I rarely thought about the language.",1480032000,,275,4.75

8425215,4,B004DEPKS6,"Berlin 36 is a very good German movie that is based on a true story of a German Jewish High Jumper Athlete Gretel Bergmann who was the British High Jump champion but was ordered back to Nazi Germany . Despite the the fact she was Jewish and the Racial discrimination, she trained with the German Team with the aim to represent her Country in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The movie shows the Hassles and unfair treatment she went through during her Training and how the International Olympic Committee had a special Interest in her case . A Movie worth watching.",1372464000,,563,4.584158415841584
8425216,4,B004DEPKS6,"This is an important film-and hopefully,Gretel Bergmann-now 98,dug it. I think it would've been better if it added a couple of details. Karoline Herfurth is fine as the Germany's Jewish-and best high jumper manuevered into returning to Germany from England for the '36 Games-then tossed under Leni Riefenshtal's camera;but Bergmann,who tied the German high jump record-which was removed from the record book and restored in 2009,was justifiably pissed off for years. Then US Olympic Boss Avery Brundage(John Keogh) who didn't believe the Nazi's were anti-Jewish and belonged to America First-an isolationist group and opposed boycotting the '36 Games is seen here telling the Germans that they have to allow Jews to try to qualify. It doesn't show Brundage's antisemitic move in pulling Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller from the US track team,just before kickoff(Brundage is the pompous schmuck who gave the'Games must go on' speech after the Israeli athletes were murdered in the '72 Olympics).Bergman was replaced by Dora Ratgen-(Marie Ketteler-as played by Sebastian Urzendowsky in the film);Ratgen finished fourth.""She"" was also male and died a couple of years ago. The stadium in Bergmann's hometown of Laufiem,which banned her in the thirties was renamed after her in '99;Bergmann finally returned to Germany was a stadium in Berlin was named after her. The plaque on it reads:In 1933,having jumped 1.51 m in Stuttgart and 1.55 m in Ulm,she became the best high jumper in Germany. On 27 June 1936,she set the German record with 1.60 m and rose to world prominence. However,because of her Jewish origins,the Nazi's prevented her from taking part in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In 1937,she left Germany forever.",1353888000,5,1711,5.317343173431734
8425217,4,B004DEPKS6,"Brilliantly acted.  The story in the movie is a little different from the ""true"" story.  Still unforgettable. Keep watching until the end.",1313971200,6,138,5.2272727272727275
