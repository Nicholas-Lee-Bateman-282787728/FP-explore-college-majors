8321389,5,B001MKE2AG,"excellent instruction.  no one has ever explained moves so clearly and efficiently.  the details of structure, posture, alignment is incredible.  this is such an education into the most important ways of moving in the martial arts. his form is impeccable. he takes the beginner or advanced person into such deep levels of practice.  this is a deep level of fundamental perfection and building of structure and proper movements.. he adds new layers into each phase as he teaches and gives excellent instruction and demonstration in many angles without the wordiness of some other dvds.  the music he has chosen allows one to relax deeply and get in sycn with his entire demonstration- chill, meditative and powerful along with his demonstration. . even just after working through series one and it's four phases in a session for myself, i find that one is more exhausted and satiated internally and physically than  'flow' type basic tai chi workout could offer. this silk reeling dvd so deeply affects  the internal  and external workout from correct alignment. he's easy to follow and one of the best teachers one could continue
 to try to mirror, or from whom to just visualize as you practice.  jose is  extremely talented in his teaching from his professional background of competition and training with the best.  he's  obviously a master of perfection in chen tai chi and the silk reeling. i have all three of these dvds and am so excited to learn from them all . and they are worth every penny.",1521590400,,1501,4.862204724409449
8321390,4,B001MKE2AG,"When I first purchased this DVD, I was slightly set off by the slow pace. I decided to keep it anyway, and began to seriously go through each phase of the lessons. I found the entire DVD well organized, packed with a lot of useful information on 'warmup,' standing meditations, the small silk weaving process and the silk weaving routines themselves.
This DVD and the other two DVD's are proving to be worth their purchase price. I have studied Tai-Chi 12 years+ and this series is enhancing my knowledge of Tai-Chi, especially the Chen style Tai Chi. I consider myself quite familiar the Yang -- Kwang Ping Yang form -- created by the son of the originator of the Yang styles (long and short) Yang, Lu Chan.
This lesson set by Master Figueroa has enhanced my knowledge and physical understanding of Tai Chi.  Beginners would benefit from this lesson set in the Chen style (the original Tai Chi form)  program as well.",1385769600,3,918,4.660493827160494
8321391,5,B001MKE2AG,"This DVD set is one of the most well put together and demonstrated self-teaching series I've seen so far.  Sifu Jose Figueroa has taken movements from the Chen Tai Chi form and broken them down into their essential components and applied them to Silk Reeling - Chan Ssu Chin.  He shows each movement from front back and sides as well as explains in easy to understand terms, how to practice the movement.

Excellent Job!",1338854400,6,420,4.648648648648648

8321393,5,B001MKE2AG,"Jose Figueroa is a top notch Tai Chi instructor. His instruction is clear, concise, and detailed. His rationale for performing the movements and exercises helped me gain a deeper understanding of the purpose behind the training. This, in turn, gave me the drive necessary to take my Tai Chi to the next level. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking to improve their form and technique.",1309824000,7,395,4.91044776119403
8321394,4,B001MKE2AG,"This Video is a very good introduction to Tai Chi Chen Style basic steps.
It helps you practise and feel the special (Silk Rolling) mooves of Chen Style Taichi.
But its price (more then 40 or 50us$) seems too high to me for one introductory DVD (amongst 4) to a martial art.",1290038400,9,274,4.288461538461538
8321395,5,B001MKE2AG,"The instruction and demo's were impeccable, shot from multiple angles so as to make it so easy, even a cave man could do it, that is if you have the will and dedication.",1280448000,9,169,4.151515151515151
