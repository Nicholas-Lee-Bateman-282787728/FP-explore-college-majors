I will now try to put this information to use in my fishing experiences.",1397174400,2,170,4.7
8042039,4,B0006OA992,"This dvd is a great companion to the book. A very non-traditional brand of fly fishing, so it really helps to see it demonstrated.",1394496000,2,130,4.458333333333333
8042040,2,B0006OA992,It was just a lot of B.S. and not worth the price.  Too much wind bagging and very little content.,1390176000,,98,3.9
8042041,5,B0006OA992,"Streamer Fishing For Trophy Trout was received and the last 1/3 of the DVD would not play.

Amazon replaced the DVD very fast. Very pleased with Amazon and the way they handled the problem.

Kelly Galloup knows very little about fly rods. He states he likes a med-fast fly rod. There is no such thing. And his knowledge of reel arbors is just as bad. He does not keep his rod tip up and loses the only trout he hooks, on the stream. With the name (Streamer Fishing For Trophy Trout) we should see some trophy trout caught. Just one trout from a boat at the very beginning. I would give the DVD a 6 out of 10.
