7910799,5,B00000IMCQ,"IN AN AUDIO/VIDEO FORM THIS IS QUITE A VALIANT EFFORT TO DISTILL HINDU DHARMA. MOST PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT OF THE TRUE NATURE OF HINDUISM. THIS IS A GOOD INTRODUCTION FOR ANYONE, AS THERE ARE SUBTITLES AND YOU DONT HAVE TO KNOW HINDI. I FOUND IT QUITE GOOD AS I UNDERSTAND HINDI AND EVEN SOME SANSKRIT. IT IS A GOOD MEDIUM TO KNOW THE TRUE ASPECTS OF THE VEDIC PATH. AS GANDHIJI SAID ""SATYAMEV JAYTE"" ""THE TRUTH  ALWAYS WINS AT THE END"" . HINDUISM HAS STOOD AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF TIME FOR OVER 5 THOUSAND YEARS. AGAINST THE TYRANNICAL ONSLOUGHT OF ISLAMIC INVASIONS AND BARBARISM AND SUBTERFUGE CONVERSIONS BY CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES BY DUPING NAIVE VILLAGERS .YES, THERE ARE SCOURGES IN THE RELIGION  LIKE CASTISM AND VARIOUS PRACTICES,BUT WHICH RELIGION IS IMMUNE TO ITS PROBLEMS. BUT THE ESSENCE OF THIS ANCIENT RELIGION IS STILL PEACE,TOLERENCE AND ABHORRENCE OF CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE AGAINST ALL LIVING BEINGS. YOU WILL NEVER FIND HINDUS TRYING TO ATTACK AND ENSLAVE PEOPLE OR COUNTIRIES OR TRY TO CONVERT OTHERS TO THEIR RELIGION LIKE MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS. MAXIMUM VEGETARIANS FROM THIS COUNTRY REFLECT THEIR  TRUE RESPECT FOR LIFE EVEN FOR THE ANIMALS.IT IS MOST HUMANE RELIGION ONCE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE SCRIPTURES AND HINDU CULTURE. MAY THE ONLY TRUE RELIGION OF PEACE AND LOVE FOREVER CLAIM ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE ANNALS OF HISTORY.",1147132800,,1355,4.960352422907489
7910800,5,B00000IMCQ,"Bhagwad Geeta (means the Song of God). It is the conversation between the greatest Warrior ARJUN and the Load KRISHNA (who is his Charioteer in the battle of Kurukhetra). It is depicted in the Great EPIC of MAHABHARATA written by Ved Vyasa (who has touched each and every aspect of human existence in his writings). If the message of Geeta is understood in a proper perspective it can offer solutions to any and every problem the world is facing today!!! It has been translated in many languages of the world. Just to mention few good translations in English are by Vinoba Bhave, by sir Edwin Arnold, by Juan Mascaro. It's message is universal and beyond any geographical or racial classifications. Eternal Truths mentioned in here are applicable to each and every human being on the face of this Earth and can be verified by putting into practice.",984441600,5,848,4.775510204081633
