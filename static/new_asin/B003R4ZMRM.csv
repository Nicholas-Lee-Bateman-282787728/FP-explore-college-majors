4176695,5,B003R4ZMRM,"A new show that is to be a series on AMC open this week, RUBICON by name, and if the first two episodes, back to back, are an indication of what is to come, this is definitely a thinking person's story.  By definition RUBICON means 'A limit that when passed or exceeded permits of no return and typically results in irrevocable commitment.'  The story in introduced in tidbits, pieces of a puzzle that seem to be at different poles with different characters in control.  A man commits suicide and leaves much of his estate and holdings to his wife  (Miranda Richardson) but he has been connected to a firm that investigates espionage-like situations.  As would be expected on an opening format, we barely get to know the characters who are bound to stay around: there is an investigative team whose leader is strangely killed in a train crash, leaving the top position open to a damaged man (James Badge Dale) whose wife and child were lost in 9/11 and his three associates - Dallas Roberts, Christopher Evan Welch, and Natalie Gold - each of whom has a bit of darkness to the character. And of course there are the elusive 'top people' (Arliss Howard et at), and naturally a 'mole' of dubious commitment to either side, whose purpose in the series is not explained as yet. There is a crunch to discover the identity of two men, puzzles to solve to piece together the plans that are in bizarre code, etc etc.  The writing for the script is good, the direction is fast paced and effective, the cast is an interesting crew of people,  the cinematography is appropriately gloomy, and the musical score manages to maintain tension.  It is worth staying with this series as the actors are all excellent and the hints of things to come are strong enough to make us want to see how they pan out.

4176736,5,B003R4ZMRM,"I am truly amazed at how obtuse corporate can be! Rubicon sets the stage for a long term, very profitable series, but it's too high brow and slow moving for the market. This is one of my all-time faves and thanks to technology I am enjoying it all over again for the 7th time. I see the patterns and love connecting the dots! The story line is beautifully constructed conspiracy theory and the cast delivers the goods and owns the reality of it!

4176737,5,B003R4ZMRM,"AMC really dropped the ball when they didn't continue  with a second season.  They don't seem to be able to think past the next fight scene in their tasteless, common shows.",1349568000,2,173,4.548387096774194
4176738,5,B003R4ZMRM,"Rubicon was a excellent program aimed at the intelligent viewer. Directed in a style reminiscent of 1970s ""paranoid"" conspiracy thrillers, it was thought provoking and genuinely interesting. It stands to reason that it had to be destroyed. A paranoid person would suspect that there is a conspiracy to eliminate a show about a conspiracy.

But I am not writing this review to repeat what others have already written about the unceremonious cancellation of yet another quality program. In the past disappointed viewers had the consolation of watching the series on video disc. As of this writing AMC has ""no plans"" to release Rubicon on DVD or BluRay. Another reviewer has provided a customer service street address to which you can register your complaint. Here is an email address: amccustomerservice@rainbow-media.com

My message to them earlier today referred to the ""no plans' statement about Rubicon, and asked why there would be no video release. The answer I received is that there are ""no plans"" to release Rubicon on DVD or BluRay. Get the message?

A brilliant show that had a coherent storyline and kept building as it progressed, adding a piece of the puzzle here and there each week.

Not since ""Firefly"" have I been so disappointed to see a TV show get the axe. Well...there was ""Journeyman""...but I digress.
""Rubicon"" was a show that you actually had to watch and be engaged in. A show that made you think.
This isn't a show to turn on and you just sit back and let it do your thinking for you.
The acting, writing, production values are all stellar and it just amazes me that AMC pulled the plug.
I'll just say this:
If AMC doesn't get up off of a DVD set, I might just go out and ""find"" this series somewhere...or find a way to get my VHS copies transferred to DVD.

4176745,5,B003R4ZMRM,"I rarely become involved in television series. But in some instances, there are some series that demand viewing if not for the entertainment but for the sheer quality of material.

Rubicon is beyond compelling. It is fresh, real and moreover intelligent. There are no explosions, no car chases or scenes with gratuitous sex. It is a program to be savored slowly, something you dwell on think about in the time between episodes. The show evolves through character development, through reveals that heighten the tension and wonder. Instead of cliches and formulas, the viewer is faced with scripts built organically, the mystery unraveling.

The series begins in New York following the life of Will Travers, an analysis working for A.P.I. (American Policy Institute). Like Robert Redford's character in Three Days of the Condor, he is employed to study the world around him, to predict the next big 'problem'. A.P.I. is a separate entity and though it may have some similarities with the F.B.I. or C.I.A. it operates independently.

Will is our Everyman and when his Team Leader and father-n-law dies during a NYC train wreck, Will is left with clues and more questions as he becomes promoted to take on a leadership role.

Ultimately, the show is focused on who is behind what and why. We see both sides but in no way is the audience completely clued in to what is going on. Like Will, we receive glimpses of the truth.

Along the way, Rubicon also casts a light on American foreign policy, the use of torture, the deviousness of secret corporations and even addiction. The many characters that make up the show are equally three dimensional reminding us, the viewer that the very souls who are trying to save the world are just like us. There's Maggie, the single mother, secretary to Will's team; Grant, the structured analysis whose personality borders on OCD. Tanya is the youngest team member, the most vulnerable as her ideals and intelligence clash with the hard realities she witnesses while working with A.P.I. Miles, equally brilliant is equally lost in his own way, a nervous work-aholic at times immune to the sinister underworld of world governments.

Of my favourite is Kale Ingram, former C.I.A. agent who acts as Will's supervisor both within A.P.I. and in other ways. The viewer is never quite sure where Kale's allegiance stands which makes Rubicon so fascinating. At one point in the season, he discusses Roman history and sheds light on the show's title and meaning. Even his facial features remind one of a Roman citizen depicted on an ancient coin.

NOTE:
Rubicon was recently canceled by AMC. My feeling is that perhaps the series was far too intelligent for its own good. Though the threat of violence haunts the characters in Rubicon, the effect is more psychological and subtle. Unfortunately, North American audiences enjoy dumb-t.v. like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars. Rubicon comes far too close to home and is meant for audiences that are uncomfortable with simple answers, answers fed to us. The majority of t.v. programs available on Direct TV, on Cable and other satellite providers is at best junk food compared to the edifying richness this show has to offer.

4176777,4,B003R4ZMRM,"I miss the good old Le Carre school of spy fiction. (His post-cold war novels left me cold though.) Some of the best TV entertainments have been made after George Smiley's adventures.
What has that got to do with Rubicon? This recent American spy series has surprisingly reached a comparable level of excellence. That, of course, needed to be punished, after all the market is the sovereign, and the ratings, it seems, were not high enough. The show has been stopped after one season. I have learned that from other reviews here. What a shame.

The short-lived series (13 episodes) was about a NY based think tank involved in analyzing global developments of security relevance. The staff consisted of nerds and freaks, as think tanks do in real life. Chief of one of the teams, after his predecessor had died in a train crash, was a youngish depressed man whose wife and daughter had been at WTC on 9-11. He looks like Jens Lehmann (this comparison is only meaningful to football fans from Germany, Argentina, and London).

The series was not about short cases, one per episode, but about a long case, which occupied the team for the whole season. My DVD cover has the nice sentence: Not every conspiracy is a theory! Good slow action with good micro situations embedded in a rather crazy macro plot.
Well, maybe not all that crazy. The chief of the institute turns out (and we are given a whiff of that fairly early) to do good business with the reports and disasters that his staff and the world's terrorists produce. Something like insider trading. If you know what kind of disaster will happen, you can make money by being prepared. From predicting disasters to making them is a short logical step. Business is business.
Which reminds me: I just saw a simple cartoon joke somewhere. Just one picture. Little boy tells an older man (grandpa?): I want to make a career in organized crime! The man responds: government or private?",1301961600,6,1932,4.729970326409496

4176783,5,B003R4ZMRM,"I won't add much to what has been written before but I will tell you that I rarely watch TV series made in the US. They are, for the most part, tripe. When you compare the quality of US shows versus British shows, it becomes clear in minutes that there is no comparison. It was a great tragedy that this series was cancelled (non-renewed) but kudos to AMC for having done it in the first place. Cable networks seem to be the last, best chance for quality adult entertainment in this country. It is sad that the entertainment provided by network television in this country caters to an audience with an emotional maturity level comfortably below 20 years of age.

I recorded all the episodes and am grateful to have them. To have the whole series on Blu-Ray would truly be a gift. <hinting loudly>",1296086400,7,796,4.489655172413793
4176784,5,B003R4ZMRM,"I loved this series, cancelled due to only abour one or two million viewers, replaced by futuristic, vampire fantasy nonsense.  I am so disappointed, as am I that FX dropped my FAVORITE series Damages, which was picked up by DirectTV last July, at least that was the latest news.

NOW I just saw a news crawler few days ago that Mad Men is teaming up with ugh.... are you ready... Playboy.  WHAT a surprise (Not Really, but sort of).  As a 68 yr old woman who was a lovely auburn haired 18 to 23 yr old in period covered so far in Mad Men, and having worked in offices, though government not pvt sector, I could relate completely to the superficial, oppressive atmosphere that the writers captured so well.  But now bringing in Playboy is clearly meant to heighten and emphasize the sexually exploitive aspects of the era for..... guess what.... higher ratings.

I'll probably watch to see what they do, but my guess is I'll drop it and continue wandering in the wilderness of the continuing lowest-common-denominator goals of television.  I can't afford the costly packages and am not really interested in a lot of cable.  I only have the basic and extra, called classic cable with Time Warner.  Don't even have digital, tho my newer tv is HD.

I'll just keep digging out my great classic VHS videos to watch on my very basic RCA VCR purchased in 1994, which I've had serviced 3 times and even has mostly metal parts.  Got a DVD player for one of several retirement gifts in June 2009 along with a 6 mos Netflix gift, and have bought Damages seasons one and two and hope to get season 3.  I buy a DVD here and there, e.g. REDS ! 1981 bought at Big Lots for $3.00 !!  Bought Modigliani, Andy Garcia, for couple of dollars at Movie Gallery going out of business, along with a dozen others, e.g. The Clearing, Robert Redford and Helen Mirren.",1295222400,2,1840,4.48948948948949

Sad and very disappointing since I read that AMC based it solely on the number of viewers, but yet they stuck with Mad Men beyond the lightly viewed first season so do not understand why Rubicon wasn't given that faith.

Rubicon is a thinking person's show and has been described as more like chess than checkers which I think is an apt description. It is intrigue and shown from intelligence analysts points of view. It is espionage combined with the story of some powerful people who want to control the world for profit. Since AMC has decided not to renew I'm now waiting for the DVD to come out and hopefully they will plump it with deleted scenes, interviews, and alternate endings.

Please, give it the full treatment: Interviews, behind-the-scenes, commentaries, making-of, and especially wide-screen versions of the episodes. This is a superb series, and it deserves a quality release, not a cheap hatchet-job, as we've seen so many times before with other, quickly-cobbled-together ""no frills"" sets.

4176803,4,B003R4ZMRM,"Spy thrillers tend to be about smart and brawny and beautiful agents with guns and kung fu moves and fast cars and explosives.  This one isn't - at least, they're not all beautiful and brawny, though some are quite easy on the eyes.  It's mostly about pencil pushers who work behind the scenes but make all the tough decision based on the timely collection of evidence.  They don't put it together and then get in a fast car or helicopter to apprehend the bad guy; they put it together and then hear about the consequences on the news and have to live with the questions, whether they got it right.

When his boss and mentor dies under suspicious circumstances, Will Travers gets caught up in the effort to solve an intricate puzzle, where he soon discovers that his life is at stake.  Some stellar performances are what kept me going through a few of the middle episodes that lagged a bit in terms of plot.  The payoff, towards the end of the season, is well worth it, so I'd definitely recommend this series.  It's not quite as engrossing as Breaking Bad - though personally I prefer it to the few episodes I've seen of Mad Men -  but it's still great television and is right now the one I look forward to the most each week.  I'm sad to see the end of season one - and can only hope it isn't the end of the series....

The ""Rubicon"" of the title is never quite explained - though Kale Ingram (one of the most fascinating characters, in an entire cast that goes way beyond one-dimensional portrayals) alludes to it at some point.  Still, it suggests the pivotal moment when Ceasar violated the sacred Roman separation of civilian rule and military leadership.  The show asks, basically: what if some of these guys, who are not military but are incredibly intelligent civilians with very high security clearances, what if some of these people who really are the smartest ones in the room, got it in their heads to manipulate intelligence for their own private gain or for whatever other motives they might possess?  They could rule the world, behind the scenes.  The problem is that the questions they are addressing and the puzzles they are solving are ones that few are even equipped to follow.  That means that the only way they could really get caught if they decided to manipulate intelligence would be from someone within, one of their own civilian peers in the intelligence community.  Usually, they are too smart to leave any clues that such a one might follow.  This show follows what happens when they leave a trail.",1287360000,11,2527,4.58

It is presented from the viewpoint of analysts - rather than spooks, with incredible in depth politics and ethics touching on all the characters and organizations surrounding American espionage.  I am a fan of MI5 (UK Spooks) - which is an incredibly well written show which storylines *rarely* fall into the realm of disbelief (like 24).  'Rubicon' is entirely believable - convoluted in plot like I Claudius.

It is well acted, with ""real"" characters, rather than the ""pretty"" phonies (all look and no substance) with which Hollywood is so enamored, especially for the myriad of TV garbage currently on display.

The story-lines are valid, as though taken from today's headlines. Intelligence work is, by its very nature, not clean and simple. It is dirty and difficult work, with a hell of a lot of ""maybes"" involved and very few certainties. This series shows that the essence of the intelligence field is not ""James Bond"" hijinks, but real people doing mundane tasks to put together a viable and actionable file. Previously, the best programs in this vein were the British ""Smiley"" series and the ""Sandbaggers"", and the British movies ""Funeral in Berlin"" and the ""Ipcress File"".

The Rubicon series is, by its nature, gritty and real. It is too bad that it was not an HBO production, so we could get the actual language and a sense of the real action, but so far AMC seems to be doing a good, albeit toned down for the children, job.

But there is plenty of intelligent dialogue, real menace and tension to be found in between as the API go about their business. There are some great dubious characters in this drama, as well as the good guys including main character, Will Travers who heads his team of researchers And of course the acting is first rate all round.

This is a slow burner for maybe half of its 13 episodes, but in the second half the tension really starts to crank up. And sadly there is a cliffhanger at the end, because AMC were expecting to produce a second series, so very frustrating.

As you are well aware, there is no DVD release available unless you want to pay a fortune for a second hand copy when one comes along. But this wonderful series (all 13 eps) is still available online if you know where to look, and that is how I managed to download the whole lot for zilch. And as another reviewer pointed out, it's even better when you re-watch it. No feelings of guilt here as I have read AMC could not even be bothered to respond to anyone asking them where they could find a copy, or about re-releasing Rubicon.",1461801600,12,1519,4.363957597173145
8403235,5,B003R4ZMRM,"This series obviously ""cut too close to the quick"", so to speak.  ""Rubicon"" must really have plucked a raw nerve with the Insider shadow-government because even though the series was acclaimed and had gathered a significant audience, the series was abruptly cancelled -- and now you can't buy a DVD of it at Amazon, or even pay to watch it on Amazon's streaming service. Evidently, those who run and control everything, and rule over us all, became aware of this series and decided it was too dangerous to be made available to us in the unwashed lower classes that make up the American ""rat-herd"".",1452470400,6,597,4.740384615384615

Another season would have been great.",1380499200,9,149,5.7272727272727275
