3123187,5,B001450KCS,"This film is outstanding.  Historical accuracies aside, this movie has an amazing message.  It is such a beautiful story.  It is also the biggest bollywood movie I have ever seen, with thousands of extras in some scenes.  The costumes and set design are absolutely stunning and look phenomenal on the big screen.

The dvd however is a complete flop.  It is not even anamorphic widescreen.  When it is stretched to fill your widescreen tv, the picture becomes heavily pixelated, and the subtitles get cut off!!  I'm hoping that UTV will correct this issue, and hopefully in the future, release this film on Blu-ray.",1221004800,128,614,4.893203883495145

3123189,5,B001450KCS,"It's not often that a movie of this caliber comes along from any country, but thankfully one has! I don't go see movies at a theatre often, but this movie showed me  how a really great movie can touch you in so many ways and yes, bring a lot of joy!

Take a tumultuous and interesting period in Indian history (the 1500's, when the young Muslim Mughal emperor Akbar is still consolidating control over the various kingdoms of northern India), add a fascinating story of his politically based marriage (taboo until then) to the Hindu princess Jodhaa, have two of the most stunning human beings (Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai) play the leads, and with SERIOUS romantic sizzle between them... add beautiful locations (forts and courts of Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi), exquisite interiors, sumptuous costumes and exquisite jewelery (who would have had more?)... and not least, envelop the whole thing in AR Rahman's unforgettable music, and you have Jodhaa Akbar!

Akbar, for those who don't know, is known in history as ""Akbar the great"", for many reasons, especially his (novel) tolerance of non-Muslims.  This movie shows some of the seeds of his tolerant stand towards non-Muslims, something very different from his predecessors and contemporaries.  He seems to have been a multi-faceted man, known both as a great warrior as well as for his encouragement of the fine arts in his court.  His heir was born to his Hindu Rajput wife, here (and historically) known as Jodhaa.

This is my first time seeing Hrithik Roshan, and I'm amazed how perfect and appealing he is in this role. He is both quietly regal and seriously magnetic!  He's great!  I now understand why there was ""Hrithik-mania"" in India when he started acting!

The movie shows how this couple eventually go past their cultural and religious differences to build trust and love. Hrithik and Aishwarya bring Akbar and Jodhaa and their mutual fascination and wariness so convincingly to the screen (but then, who would not be fascinated with one of them as your spouse?).  The final scene has to be one of THE most romantic scenes I've ever seen! It's breathtaking, especially with the music. It exemplifies that you can develop extreme sensuality without ""R"" rated scenes if you know what you're doing.

A R Rahman's score is fabulous and evocative. Khwajaa mere khwajaa, Mann Mohana and Inn Lamahon are instant classics and add so much to the depth and beautiful texture of this movie.  Unlike standard Indian movies, where the music may distract from the movie, the few choice songs in this movie add to and tie together the movie.  I now want to look for more AR Rahman music (and I know there's tons for this superstar music director).

Oh yes, for those looking for action - there are exciting battle scenes and sword fights.  Elephants and camels going to war!  It was fun to see helmets and shields of the type I've seen at the National Museum in Delhi actually being used in this movie.  And to see the various forts being used as they would have been 500 years ago was magical!  History indeed sprang to life, and so excitingly.

The whole movie team has done a great job - a coherent plot beautifully executed (a rarity in any movie, whether Western or Indian), stunningly photographed and edited, with stars you can watch all day and music that stays with you, altogether draw you in and keep you engrossed for the whole 3+ hours (there is an intermission at the theatre). Although there's plenty of fiction that the writers had to develop (since they admit there's no real info on this pair's private life), there's also plenty of real history shown in this movie, including interesting small details.  It made me do a lot of web searching afterward on various related topics.

I'm really happy to see an Indian movie be both deeply Indian and produced so compellingly and professionally - something that older Indian movies, which often had good stories and great music, but often kept going long after the plot had run out really missed out on.  The plot and story line are tight and the editing is fabulous.

The biggest compliment I can give is that rather than watching a made up movie, I felt like I was actually watching them living their real lives! That certainly doesn't happen too often! I've enjoyed it so much, that I've driven 100 miles round trip twice in one week to see it on the big screen!

This movie should be showing at mainstream theaters in the US.  Friends of all backgrounds enjoyed the soundtrack so much that they want to see the movie. I only hope Oscar's paying attention - this is much higher order movie making than 99% of the stuff out anywhere.

Hollywood can take many lessons from Mr. Gowariker (the director), including on how to develop romance on screen, something (along with humanity and warmth) that's really missing in most western movies these days.  Too many of today's movies are busy blasting us out of the theatre with the noise level, cutting from scene to scene so quickly as to almost  bring on seizures (as well as make us miss out on what's going on) and general contrivance and predictability.

See it at the theater first if you possibly can (it's too big and beautiful to squeeze into the small screen - you're going to be missing out on a lot!), or at least on the dvd if you can't, but don't miss it - it's too much fun, and it's the closest we can come to time travel to the 1500's!!

BTW, it thankfully has good English subtitles (other than for the song ""Inn Lamahon"", where the subtitles make no sense at all)!  There are websites that give both song lyrics and their English translation that add to your enjoyment.  I give it two thumbs and two big toes up too! Thank you, Ashutosh Gowariker!",1211500800,6,5729,4.697

Do yourself a favor, and wait until the official copy comes out. The sub-titles are so bad that in some scenes it completely changes the tone of the movie.

3123192,3,B001450KCS,"Hrithik has been my favourite of the lot of Indian actors and let me tell you he's very good and so are the rest of them. He was recently quoted as saying, ""I do not want to be amidst mediocrity."" I like him for saying that. After Dhoom 2, he perhaps wanted to break away from the ""cool guy"" image and do something a bit more Braveheartish or oulandish. A million people awaited this film in my city alone. The audience looked a bit trapped and worried during the interval wondering what the second half would bring.

It is an extraordinarily long film and unlike Lagaan, it doesn't really captivate as it becomes a tad too self involved with it's ""epic romance"" genre. That said, I must credit Aiswarya Rai on quite a good performance. The rest of the star cast were ok, there were a few new acts and due to similar faces, it also became a difficult to keep track with the them and the storyline, which in itself isn't all that intriguing.

There was some hunky dory chemistry between Hrithik and Aish. A bollywood film is nothing without the music and the songs, each and every one of them, were/was very good. But then tell me...have we not seen this before in nother films? JA will appeal to a certain audience while I can't help but feel it insulted my blind trust in a Hrithik Roshan film.

While Hrithik's act is good, I usually expect excellence from him, so he was a bit disappointing. Am I being cynical, I don't know, but this film is really really average.

When you're watching a film based on a king, you expect to see a bit more prudence on part of the film-maker with regards to how the king rules, his administration, his ways, his character pecularities, this film is short-sighted when you take into account what Akbar, the king was. Now, come on, I know it's supposed to be a different genre but quite apologetic considering little was incorporated of that.

I think this film will bomb but it's ok, one must learn.
Do watch this film but don't even expect an ""Alexander"" (which was slighty above average mind you) [...] says it's an 8/10, I'd say barely 6.

HSA",1203465600,,2091,4.460732984293194
3123193,5,B001450KCS,"Watching this instant masterpiece from India, its unbelievable that the world has yet to take note of the industrys' obvious genius. ""Jodhaa Akbar"", a 3.5 hour long epic that works both as a love story, as well as a religious tolerance message, is prime example of how Bollywood is infinitely more creative, colorful and luminous than Hollywood. The film takes us back to the times when movies like ""Gone with the Wind"" were made - but with better looking actors, better music, better direction, and a budget that could sink the Titanic.

My favorite thing about this movie is Aishwarya Rai (now Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan). This is an actress who starred in this decades' best Hindi film thus far (""Devdas""), and also headlined the best Bengali film of the decade (the underrated ""Chokher Bali""). I saw it for her, and rediscovered the worlds' most beautiful woman. Seriously, is she even human? Aishwarya is beyond a perfect being - its as if the heavens and the stars and some alien DNA all combined to create one spectacular vision. Take it from me - no human woman, before or after, will ever look as good as Aishwarya does in this film. And re-reading that line, Im afraid it still doesn't do justice to her unsurpassed beauty. Indian women are where its at.

Hrithik Roshan plays the King Akbar, but I found much to like about this otherwise wooden actor. The film has a few scenes that stand out way after the movie is over, and if you're into researching and studying film as a passion or a hobby, this movie is tailormade to cater to your sensibilities. Despite both actors being in their mid-30s, their unique love story burns with the incandescence of a teenage romance. The director is especially successful in providing different shades to the character of Jodhaa - Aishwarya goes from warrior princess who excels at sword-fighting, to a bhajan-singing housewife - all within an hour. The scene where she faces off with her mother in law over who rules the kitchen (and thus the heart of her man) is my special favorite.

Ultimately, the film succeeds for me because its not frivolous. It would have been so easy to make a beautiful looking movie and doll it up, but this one actually has a message. However, if you're not Indian and you're reading this review, the magnitude of the films' message would perhaps be lost upon you. The fact that a conservative Hindu princess entered a completely Muslim household almost 500 years ago is utterly fascinating. How did she survive there? Did they try to convert her to Islam? The movie addresses all this. I loved how the Jodhaa character refuses to accept Islam as her own religion, though she respects it from afar. The couple get married with Hindu and Muslim rites, one after the other, and the story chronicles how the fact that they came from two different religions had nothing to do with what they felt for each other.

The music - well, this soundtrack admittedly has no standout tracks upon first listen, and you simply have to watch the film to appreciate the album. Its mood music, and Rahman has done a wonderful job at it. The track where Jodhaa and Akbar consummate their marriage is unique and touching, primarily because of the way its shot. Gowariker, as ever the perfectionist extracts nuanced performances from all concerned. But the film belongs ultimately to Aishwarya Rai, who proves beyond a doubt that she is the most luminous actress on screen in any part of the world. Yes, she isn't a seasoned actress like Meryl Streep, but look at her. What eyes! What lips! What a fascinating specimen of how incredible human genes can be! Her role as Jodhaa propelled her, in my mind, to the very top of the list of actresses in the world today who are actually worth watching.

A five star epic? Yes. Its not better than other Indian classics such as ""Mughal E Azam"", but this is easily the best film India has released in the last twenty years. I highly suggest you track this down and watch it on the big screen while you can, because its worth every second of it. I'll certainly be buying the DVD as well as the CD - this is a film to watch with your family - and put it on repeat. A modern masterpiece.",1203379200,39,4178,4.632928475033738

My wife is Asian, and she doesn't like having to read English sub-titles but she does enjoy watching this film with me only because she thinks Hrithik Roshan is the most handsome man on earth.

I love Aishwarya Rai, but she's not my favorite. I appreciate this Bollywood film because there are no silly scenes in this film at all.  Bollywood is notorious for adding dumb humor into films, even serious films, so thank you for not making this film have any dumb humor scenes.

After seeing this film, I really wish that they would release ""Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India"" onto Blu-Ray. That's the main beautiful film that introduced me to Bollywood films.",1425168000,4,893,4.6687898089171975

It is worth watching for the lush scenery and amazing costumes alone.  I have confidence the historical based storyline will grab your attention.  This movie seems to have something for everybody.  At the heart of the three plus hour movie is a truly compelling love story.  For those who like ""royal court intrigue"" there are several subplots of treachery, rebellion and war to keep your interest.  There is some lovely music, but if you're looking for the trademark Bollywood song and dance numbers, I'm afraid this movie hasn't any.  This picture is very family friendly.  Despite the scenes of warfare, there are no dismembered bloodied corpses prominently displayed.  There are no sex scenes and there's no cursing.

Watch this film then Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (hope I spelled that correctly) then DHOOM2 and then on Youtube on the internet you can catch his dance moves!!  Da Joob Ja Doob or (Come Dance with Me) and Just Dance.  He has the moves like Michael Jackson!!
Also on YouTube his first tv interviews about 14 yrs ago...Rendezvous with Simi Garawal...it's in 2 parts with his parents and there is a later one with his wife, Suzanne.

I won't comment on the quality of the movie itself as far as story, acting, etc. because that's been covered well elsewhere but will say that the cinematography and costumes are jaw-droppingly gorgeous.  Mostly I want to reinforce that the Blu-ray version is fantastic.  The spoken language is Hindi and there are subtitles in English and Arabic.

3123340,5,B001450KCS,"I am an educator who went looking for a film that would give my American students a little glimpse of Hinduism and found this movie on my first search. I watched it, then, my teenage daughter watched it with me, and by word of my mouth, it spread through my entire family of seven.  I had never seen a ""Bollywood"" movie before, but all of us fell in love with this movie, even my 7-year-old daughter,promptly used her allowance to buy an Indian princess Barbie ""that looks just like Jodhaa.""  Not only that, but the music, the traditional dancing, the lavish scenery and so much physical beauty and good chemistry between the two stars, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai made us wonder if these people were even human.  We downloaded the soundtrack and have watched this film again and again. The song, ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" is one of the best moments in the movie.

One of the features of ""Bollywood"" that I appreciate, besides the gentle romance, comedic moments and memorable music, is that it is generally very clean.  It's so refreshing to see a film that my younger children can wander into the room and see and not have to worry about.  This has opened the door for our family to see a number of other Hindi films since discovering this one.

As to the historicity of the film, all I know is that the film is based upon the life and rule of Mughal emperor Akbar the Great who married a Hindu princess and promoted an early form of religious pluralism.  Enjoy!",1365120000,3,1464,4.518939393939394

3123342,5,B001450KCS,"Pros: The spectacle of this film has most in common with classic macro-productions like El Cid, Ben Hur, Cleopatra, and The Ten Commandments. The leads have great chemistry, and the intrigues are on par with other imperial stories like Ran or Cromwell. It does not overindulge in musical numbers, but has singing and underscoring to fit the theme. I particularly like the racial and religious tensions played out here, as it illuminates much of the conflict between Islamic and Hindu peoples that carried on well into the 20th century. The action is well-paced, if you are prepared for its epic length and high vision, and the sets are phenomenal, often shot on location. There are also some epic fight scenes of medieval combat, complete with elephant cavalry.

Cons: For a few minutes, neither of the leads is on screen, and then they spend a good deal of time in separate storylines. This is the plot, but when they are together, the romance and tragedy really sparkles. There are definitely some good fight scenes and at least one compelling supporting role to get your through this first bit, but I think it is the weakest part of the film.

Synopsis: As I love big historic dramas, I really liked this. I expected it to be good, but it really eschewed all camp and pageantry to tell a grand story. I could easily share this with older and younger generations because it is so well done.",1362787200,4,1392,4.700819672131147

It seems like the production team took pains to invest time and quality in the set design, costumes and battle sequences to give the film an authentic historical look (I can't say with confidence that it's 100% historically accurate but it looks that way).

First things first, FORGET ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT BOLLYWOOD! It no longer applies.

There's only one person ultimately responsible for this exquisite experience. Ashutosh Gowariker is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He's creates images on film that are heartbreakingly beautiful, combines them with master storytelling, and coaxes performances from the cast that defies all expectations. I have a goal to see every film he's made thus far, and the three I've seen I'd recommend to anyone! There isn't a single detail of this film he to chance, and the result is as close to perfection as a human can get. Each frame of the movie is so gorgeous you want them to be oil paintings to hang in your house. More on that when I deal with the special features...

This movie caused a huge ruckus when it opened because of historical controversy. Being a history buff, I did some research (yes I'm weird) and while the movie did take some liberties, and leaves many things out, it gets more right than it does wrong! Besides, if it had been 100% accurate and included *everything* it would have been a nine hour movie, and would've gotten a little depressing! Movies are meant to entertain, so keep an open mind. Brushing mundane reality aside, let's focus on the world Ashutosh Gowariker so generously gave us. I can't think of many movies that look and sound as beautiful as this one is. The sets, locations, the costumes, the music, the sounds of the swords clashing, the horses, the elephants, the jewelry!!!! (I'm a girly-girl when it comes to the pretties) the food... Even if you watch this movie on mute, it's an experience, but in the name of anything sacred DON'T DO THAT!

The music is transforming! I'm not exaggerating, when I hear the first strains of ""Jashn-E-Bahaara"" anything negative in my life disappears. I'm serious it's the best painkiller I know of. I would dance to  ""Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah"" all day if I could do it. More on that song later... There are two songs that I would call hymns ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" (Islamic) and ""Mann Mohana"" (Hindu) but as I'm neither Hindu nor Muslim, I hope I haven't offended anyone. Regardless of how to classify them the music is exquisite and the lyrics really highlight Akbar's devotion to his faith, and Jodhaa's integrity and devotion to hers. A little fun trivia for you is that,  Haidar Ali (the writer) has a cameo of a Sufi who leads his group in singing ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" after the Islamic wedding ceremony.  For sheer passion and the rapture of *finally* being in the arms of your love, you simply cannot top ""In Lamhon Ke Daaman Mein"" its honeymoon music to the tenth power!

Again, check your assumptions about Bollywood song and dance at the door. Here the actors do very little singing, (okay they're dubbed who cares!) Jodhaa sings to pray, and has a verse in the ""honeymoon song"" in which she does a pretty twirl. Jalal has a pretty little verse of poetry he sings in Urdu in the ""honeymoon song"" as for dancing, he also has a pretty twirl in ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" but that's it! Azeem-O-Shaan Shahensha is an epic dance number with one thousand people, that would make Bugsby Berkley go green with envy, but unlike most epic numbers in Bollywood, it does not take the form of a music video! Unlike with his masterpiece ""Swades"" Mr. Gowariker doesn't heed the typical sensibilities for using music to tell the love story; it's a masterstroke keeping everything in proper historical context, and preventing the actors from breaking character.

The background score is also beautiful and varied. The only thing that stops it from being the absolute best score I've ever heard is merely a few notes that play whenever some fool gets Jalal angry, I mean come on Mr. Roshan's eyes take care of that entirely on their own!

Horses and doves, parrots and bunnies, camels and elephants OH MY! The gang's all here and it's great! Out with the old theater adage ""Never work with children or animals"" without them this movie would feel flat! Whether it's Jodhaa cooing with doves, bunnies, and setting her parrots free, or Jalal riding his white horse into battle, and blowing off the stress of being Shahensha (Emperor) by taming a wild elephant, you will be awed with it all and wonder, ""How in the world did they keep it all under control?""

A caution to parents... Dear responsible, loving parents, Most of the elephants in this movie are used during battle scenes, and a few crush some soldiers even stepping on their heads. Now, I personally believe that most kids over the age of five see worse on most previews and commercials here in the USA, but I strongly urge you to view the scenes first before sitting down with the munchkins. When my nephews visit, I skip them entirely. Your's Respectfully Warpgirl.

The costume designer Neeta Lulla and jewelers Tanishq turn everyone into people who inhabit a time and a place of lost grandeur. Okay, you might have seen Ms. Rai-Bachchan with a similar look in some of her big period films but I doubt it. I'll let you know when I see them for myself. I am certain you've *never* seen Mr. Roshan draped in silk, and brocade dripping with diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds! They used the real deal here! Two kilograms for his gold and ruby sword alone! In case you're wondering he's pulls it off effortlessly. If this movie had been submitted for Oscar consideration it would have won a boatload, but Costumes would be a definite lock! Special kudos to the makeup department, just flawless. I find makeup to be a bit iffy with Bollywood.

Now, performances! I did warn you this would be long... I watched the movie the first time for Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan so it's only fair I start with her. It boggles my mind that I've read in so many places where people say she can't act! If she can't act, then I must have the wrong idea of what acting is. She uses every part of herself in a role: her voice, the way she walks, the way she eats, heck even the way she sits! Jodhaa is my favorite because she's a lady in her thirties and she's playing a young woman barely twenty and not only does she pull it off, she looks twenty! I don't mean her beautiful face, I mean in her eyes and expression there's innocence and wonder that makes that time of life so special. There are no famous Bollywood histrionics in this movie. Subtle is the name of the game and you must keep most of your focus on the eyes. I recommend the first time you watch this, you read the subtitles, then watch it again and forget them! The biggest emotional impact comes from the characters eyes. Now you'll notice quickly that Ms. Rai-Bachchan is wearing brown contacts for authenticity, but it's a credit to her skill and talent that her emotions shine through like gleaming flames.

Jodhaa is a woman of integrity, it's her defining trait. She treats others with kindness and deep respect, but never backs down about what she believes is right. Even when other people wrong her, she doesn't berate them, or try to get even. She holds herself to high standards with grace and dignity. My favorite scene that *always* makes me cry, (my mom was torments me about it) is when she says Jalal's full name for the first time. Perfection! Nevertheless, probably her most technically brilliant scene is the ""wedding night"" scene. It's jaw dropping!

I had no idea who Hrithik Roshan was, now I can't believe it took me over two decades to discover him! For anyone who finds his ""hunky-grin"" tiring, or thinks of him as ""the dance guy"" *forget it* just forget it all. There's no grinning at all, and I didn't even know the man could dance until Dhoom2! Are there tears? Yes. However, not the typical Bollywood tears made so famous in frothy romances, or melodramas. Like with Jodhaa, subtlety is the key to Mr. Roshan's portrayal of, Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar.

Again he's a man in his thirties playing a young man just turning twenty and he makes it work even though his body is like no twenty year old I've ever seen. He infuses Jalal with idealism, innocence, and the deep venerability of a boy struggling not only to become a man, but also to break free from expectations of the people surrounding him and become a true leader. It's an incredibly complex performance, with layer after layer of technique and emotion.

As written, Akbar is very close to being untouchable. He's so good, so pure, intelligent, compassionate, the bravest, ect. Quite honestly, if Mr. Roshan hadn't kept him solidly on the ground, I'd think the movie is about an angel not a man. ""Akbar's angry tune"" aside, Mr. Roshan adds a hair trigger temper, and a talent for holding a grudge that keeps him refreshingly human. Every scene he does is incredible but the ones that show that he's more than just the ""dancing hunk"" are: first, ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" no dialogue, just the expression of how deeply he reveres his God, and the conviction of his faith. Then, ""the wedding night"" rarely are two actors so in-tune with each other. After that, ""the mother scene"" if your heart doesn't twinge, see a doctor. All men should watch ""the groveling scene"" that's how you do it! ""The patriotic scene"" shows the moment when Jalal takes complete control of his empire and his life and Roshan is statesman and Alpha Male at the same time. However, the crown jewel is the ""do you love me"" scene. It's all in the eyes.

Both actors are brilliant in their own rights, but neither one would have given such amazing performances without the other. Every-so-often, two actors will be put in a film and something happens. The camera becomes a window and suddenly you're not watching a movie anymore. You become a peeping Tom watching two people go through a finite space in time living and everything that comes with their lives. Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai-Bachchan have done three films together, (this is the second) and all of them are completely different, but in every one, you become a voyeur. They don't play roles with each other, they *become* them. I know I sound insane, I feel silly writing it! Just do me a favor watch, ""the sword scene"" and when *the moment* comes, (you'll know it when it happens) try not to gasp when you see the love flowing between them.

 NO, I am NOT saying I think they had an affair! I'm saying, that they're that good! I keep hoping to read they've signed on for a dance extravaganza. It can happen!

Not to be outdone is the fabulous supporting cast! Two women dominate this playing field of massively talented people! First up the only fully fleshed ""villain"" in the story, (more on the bad guys in a minute)... Ila Arun plays the astute Maham Anga. Talk about every young bride's worst nightmare, the possessive Mother Figure! You see Maham Anga was one of Jalal's father's concubines, and  when Jalal's mother went with her husband while they were in exile, they left their son in her care. Later on after Jalal becomes Emperor, mom goes throughout the empire helping while ""Elder Mother"" still looks after him. Now, she's basically in charge of the entire royal court and the only person Jalal will never contradict.

To say she doesn't like the incredibly beautiful Hindu bride Jalal has picked out is an understatement. The minute I saw her on screen I cried out, ""OMG it's the Indian Mrs. Danvers!"" I suppose that means nothing to people who haven't seen or read Rebecca... Google it, if you want. To summarize, Maham Anga is extremely jealous and hates Jodhaa with a passion that boarders on the crazy. Of course, it culminates into something terrible, but it also provides two of the most romantic moments in the movie. If her own machinations aren't bad enough, she has a biological son who causes Jalal misery, so she does double-duty as a villain in this film.

The other amazing woman in this movie is Mrs. Poonam Sinha, who plays Jalal's biological mother Empress Hamida Banu Begum. This is the mother-in-law every bride prays for! Supportive, sweet, a helping hand in a new family, and in Jodhaa's case a new world. She wants her boy happy and can see immediately Jodhaa is exactly what he needs. It's astounding how Mrs. Sinha balances the emotions of her character. She *knows* her son considers another woman to be his ""mother"" yet instead of being bitter about it, she does what she can to help him rule and make sure someone is taking care of Jodhaa when he's busy. Of course, ""the mother scene"" just makes everything better. There is one weird thing, she talks to Jodhaa a lot, but Jodhaa never says a word! I guess her eyes talk for her.

Now bad guys and idiots... I'll be honest, the villainy is not the sharpest of swords in the armory. In a movie with so much going on you end up not caring that they're flat. First up, the spawn of Anga. Adham Khan the jealous, sadistic, amoral, older half-brother. Every family has a bad seed. Adham is an angry guy. First his dad doesn't choose him as a successor, then his mom is obsessed with the runt (the guy is taller than most people) who got it. Personally, I think if his mother had hugged him more he might not have become a traitorous, raping, thief! Don't worry parents, there is no rape in this movie. It comes out in a verbal argument. As far as brains go, he's definitely the stupidest one! Watch and see how stupid!

Now, the family problems don't end there. Jalal also has a pretty older sister named Banu, who has a very nasty husband! Alas, Sharifuddin Hussein wants to be Shahensha too! He does have more brains than Adham, but that's no real achievement. For the most part, he plots in secret and tries to avoid getting his hands dirty until the very end. The person I feel sorry for is Banu, she actually loves the jerk! Don't ask me why, he makes it clear he doesn't return the sentiment. He gets lots of help from other idiots, the head Religious Leader of the Mughal court. This guy hates Jalal's tolerance of things not strictly Islam and the tax reform that hurts his wallet.

The other idiot helper is Raj Sujamal Jodhaa's brother, not really a bad guy in the evil sense, but a true moron! Sujamal is a major player in the movie. He's Jodhaa's first cousin, but they were raised as siblings. She calls him Bhaisab, (older brother) he has her rahki it's all very familial, no romantic subtext at all. The problem lies in politics. Jodhaa's dad inherited the throne from his brother Sujamal's father. Now he hopes his uncle gives him a fair share when the kingdom is divided up on his death. You'll have to watch the movie but let me put it this way, he was stupid to trust Sharifuddin.

The actor who plays Sujamal is Sonu Sood. Apparently, he's a rising star in Bollywood, but he does very little here but mope, whine, and throw temper tantrums. Out of all the negative characters, he's the weak link because he's just so wishy-washy. Who knows, maybe that's the point. His final scene was very touching.

There is ONE tiny flaw in this movie it drives me stark raving bonkers! In the wedding scenes, Jodhaa is decked out in her bridal finery. She's wearing amazing jewelry with a large tikka that lays flat on her forehead during the ceremony, but somehow during ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" it changes to a ""bell"" shaped tikka that rests on top of her hairline!

Now Special Features! On the third disk of this set, you get... Deleted scenes with subtitles! YEY! Hindi lessons courtesy of the sing-along with the songs feature. Lots of movie trailers that hint of other deleted goodies that didn't get put in, (darn!) again with subtitles. An interview with Gowariker addressing the controversy on Historical Accuracy. There's a  little commentary involving all the heavy hitters in the movie. All in English! Mr. Roshan's accent is swoon-worthy. (Okay yes I need a 12-step program or something!) Fair warning, something went wrong with the sound during Mrs. Gowariker's (also a producer) interview. It isn't the DVD itself so don't worry. It sounds like a microphone blew out. Everyone else is as clear as a bell.

Oh remember how I said you'll want to take the images on screen and hang them up? You can! A beautiful set of large postcards also come with the DVD's. Some of the most breataking images are there for pretty pictures! I thought about using them for there intended purpose but they're just too pretty!

Enjoy this beautiful movie! It's a true treasure.",1351382400,7,16555,4.646958304853042

It's a throwback to the Bollywood tradition of giving audiences their money's worth by making an evening out of the movie - but when it's this involving, it's absolutely worth it.

Unfortunately, this ""Three Disc Collector's Edition"" seems to be a bootleg or some kind, with non-anamorphically enhanced video and a cover that, while sumptuous, appears to be a dark copy of the original. I probably should have suspected seeing the cover art, but I saw UTV's logo and (mistakenly) assumed it was just a bad scan and the movie itself was legit.

History is rewritten to suit our modern sensibilities - Jodha was neither Akbar's only wife nor a skilled swordswoman who loved cooking and caligraphy, Akbar was not an athletic and handsome ruler with a democratic heart, and the existence of his evil, politically powerful wet nurse is yet to be documented. With its veneer of authenticity, well-chosen songs, lavish costumes, and numerous reenacted battles, the movie succeeds in recreating the golden age of Mughal rule in Northern India.

This is actually my second set that I had bought because I loaned out the first one to someone and never got it back, hehehe....I wonder why?  The first set played flawlessly, and as I remember too, the DVD quality was stunning! A few years later, I bought another one at a local indian store and I got another winner!  It had two discs just like the first one and the movie was pretty darn lenghty if you ask me, but it didn't matter because it was so intense.  I never had a falling eye on this movie.  I even loaned it to my older sister (we are african american by the way) and showed it to my other family members and enjoyed it also.  Yes, I had to read the subtitles, but they weren't lengthy and stayed on long enough to read at a reasonable speed and still view the beautiful background and the actors as well.  The film quality was on the level of LAGAN if you ask me, and that says alot!  It is a little annoying to have to deal with the UTV start up, but for me, it's worth the little annoyance.  They gotta promote somewhere. I would make sure that if you purchase the DVD set, that you get the exact 2 or 3 disk collectors edition.

3123374,4,B001450KCS,"WONDERFUL...BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES & CINEMATOGRAPHY. Loved the wide-angle shots that gave a sense of locale & emphasized the beautiful interiors.  Aerial shots accentuated the dance formations & elegant floors. Admirable performances by main actors.  I hadn't seen any Bollywood or period Indian movies before...this was VERY impressive.  The many extras and sense of grandeur reminded me of epics from the Golden Age of Hollywood like ""The Ten Commandments"".  Despite being over 3 hrs long, the film is riveting and you forget the time.

The story is about the historical figure, Jalal Mohammed Akbar (Hrithik Roshan), a wise 16th-century Indian  ruler who unites Hindustan.  When he assumes full power as Mughal emperor at 19 y/o he displays wisdom & compassion combined with strategic planning & discipline.  Jalal, who is Muslim, agrees to a marriage of alliance to promote peace.  His betrothed is the Hindu Princess Jodha of Amer (Aishwarya Rai).  This introduces two of the movie's themes: 1) religious conflict (Muslim vs. Hindu) and 2) the blossoming love between Jalal & Jodha.  The importance of religion in daily life is an integral part of this film.  Jalal shows his wisdom by decreeing tolerance of all religions, not only Islam.  Of course, there are the usual palace intrigues and plots to contend with.  Meanwhile, tension and passion build as love grows between Jalal & Jodha.  When they finally consummate their love the scene is superb!  The incredible lighting & interior combined with tenderness b/w the two actors make the scene intensely sensual (without the overt sexuality often seen in this type of scene - which is a refreshing change).  Roshan & Rai are gorgeous, adding to the beauty of the film...In fact, Roshan is probably one of the most handsome & charismatic men I have seen!!  He gives a passionate performance particularly with his eyes & body language.

Although many people have pointed out that the movie strays from historical accuracy, it is still a beautiful story about a wise leader who bucks tradition and chooses compassion over bloodshed, openness and acceptance over intolerance.  It is also a wonderful love story. Besides, this follows the Hollywood tradition: How accurate was Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra""?

The only reason I didn't give this 5-stars is the singing.  Sometimes it supported the mood of the scene, e.g. Jalal abolishes the Pilgrimage Tax.  There the singing & dance conveyed a sense of celebration.  At other times, it was distracting; music without vocals may have been better.  Also, I'm not a fan of the high-pitched chant-like sound in some of the songs.  Still, this movie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1334793600,2,2668,5.160839160839161

Jodhaa Akbar is a great exception. It's epic on the scale of Gladiator or Lawrence of Arabia. The movie follows the first years of the famous Mughal Emperor Akbar and particularly his relationship with his wife Jodhaa. The battles aren't really the focus of the movie but are pretty well done. More importantly, you get the sense that there is a real and budding relationship between Akbar and Jodhaa. The political intrigue is great, with brothers betraying each other and parents marrying their daughters off.

3123389,5,B001450KCS,"My review is a bit different from the others I've read.  Most of them talk about a visually stunning movie, but what I like most about it is how appropriate it is for my family.  We're white Christian Americans living in a small city in the Western states, so about all the cultural exposure we get are a few restaurants and an immigrant coworker or two.  We recently started watching Bollywood because I wanted to broaden my family's appreciation for art that exists outside our society.  They took to it immediately.

My children are 10 and 12 years old.  Whenever we watch another Bollywood film, they always ask if there will be musical numbers and beautiful costumes.  Jodhaa Akbar was a complete feast for the senses, all the way through.  It enabled us to witness two world religions that are not our own, without negative viewpoints about either one.  Though it doesn't go very far into the dynamics of either religion, and though I've read opinions that it misrepresents both religions, it's a nice introduction to them without muddying the beauty of the faiths with prejudice and negative emotions.  The scene with the Sufis broadened the experience even more.

It's difficult to find modern movies that step outside the common themes of partying and superficial beauty, and still keep a handle on the language, sex, nudity, etc.  We've rarely had to worry about that with Bollywood.  There is a little violence with the war scenes, but it's in context and not too graphic.

In addition, my kids have to read all the subtitles to really note what's going on.  Before they know it, they've read for several hours without a single complaint.  It is a long production, so it may take several evenings to get through it with your family, but it's a highly enriching experience.",1314316800,23,1783,4.777777777777778

3123401,5,B001450KCS,"Director Ashutosh Gowariker--who helmed the Oscar-nominated 'Lagaan' (2001)--transports audiences to another world--a world of courtly romance, legendary battles, and palace intrigue--the 16th-century world of one of history's most fascinating figures, the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great. But 'Jodhaa Akbar' is more than a lavish period piece with sumptuous sets and rich costumes, and more than a love story between captivating characters. Its focus is the Muslim emperor's noble goal of religious tolerance--which was the impetus for his conquest of the Indian subcontinent and his marriage to the Hindu princess Jodhaa.

Akbar the Great was one of the most progressive leaders the world has ever known, and under him, Indian culture flourished. His marriage to Jodhaa--an important political alliance--is an historical fact, but her actual name is a matter of dispute and the details of their relationship are unknown. It's unlikely that they actually shared a great love, as the film purports, given that Akbar had hundreds of wives and concubines and Jodhaa was not even the first among them--a reality the film completely ignores. But no matter--the film's message that differences can be transcended by respect is a powerful one, sadly all too relevant today, and their marriage, loveless or not, was an important first step in making religious solidarity his public policy.

The early years of Akbar's reign are the subject of the film. Akbar (played by Hrithik Roshan) is a young man who has been king since he was a child. He dismisses his regent and assumes control of the government, but he's unsure of himself. While praying, Akbar has an epiphany about how to unite the religious factions in his empire and he makes the controversial decision to marry a Hindu princess. Jodhaa (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) is resistant to the idea, but she agrees to the marriage because he's going to let her keep her religion.

Akbar is soon besotted with his feisty, willful bride, but Jodhaa doesn't feel the same way and she keeps him out of her bedroom. He tries to coax her into consummating their marriage by patiently earning her trust and--the film isn't all earnest idealism--by showing off his incredible body. Meanwhile, palace insiders, who would like the country to remain religiously divided, keep trying to drive them apart.

The later years of Akbar's reign--and his contentious relationship with his son Salim--are the subject of the Bollywood classic 'Mughal-E-Azam' (1960), starring Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, and Prithviraj Kapoor.

3123403,5,B001450KCS,This is such a wonderful story about love crossing the barriers of culture. My husband and I were hooked from the beginning and there was no bad parts of this movie. It had all of the intrigue of the culture along with the momentous blossoming of love between the two main characters - both are stunningly beautiful people - who were in an arranged marriage to solidify their countrymen. To watch how they fell in love and the ultimate love scene - with no sex - was so much more romantic with the visual and musical stimulation that it took your breath away. We watched this on DVD and was astounded with the quality. Would love to have seen this on the big screen! A must watch!,1284854400,4,680,4.362204724409449
3123404,5,B001450KCS,"Even though this movie is not interrupted by the beautiful dances bollywood is famous for, i think it may be one of the best there are. The story is elaborate but doesn't feel too long, and both Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan act perfectly (plus, they are both so beautiful, it wouldn't matter if they didn't).
Totally worth it.",1284681600,2,330,4.610169491525424
3123405,5,B001450KCS,"I just love this film. Hrithik Roshan is so gorgeous I could swoon and Aishwarya Rai is an incredible beauty.  The costumes are brilliant in their color and design.  The scenery and settings are stunning in themselves.  It runs the range from battle scences, political intrigue, and family scheming to a romantic love story complete with music and dancing.  The love story centers on a very serious topic of Jodhaa taking a strong, uncompromising stand for her religious faith, despite pressure for a woman to conform and bringing peace to her region.  He must find the strength to keep his rule and establish peace among a conquered and diverse people.  Love and war, peace and diversity, all too current today.  I love a film that takes me to a different place and time.  I wish I understood Hindi, but am glad that is not dubbed.  I'm never bothered by subtitles.  And while musicals are not my favorite genre, the song & dance is minimal, most of it seeming to occur naturally in a festival setting.  I caught this film first on Netflix streaming, and decided it was one I would like to own because it is quite different from the average American film, & I wanted to make sure I could always have it on hand to watch when I wanted.",1282176000,3,1235,4.542986425339366
3123406,5,B001450KCS,"I rented this movie form Netflix and fell in love with it the extent that I had to buy it. Historical accuracies aside, it is a great period drama with a wonderful message especially in todays tumultuous geopolitical environment in that love conquers all prejudices. The movie inspired me to learn more about the history of India and the history of the Moghul dynasty. From what I gather the daughter of Raja Bharmal, whatever her name,  was the third wife of the emperor. His first wife was the cousin of his father, and marriage provided protection for her and no child came from this union. His second wife was the wife of his general Bairam Khan and she was 12 years older than him. He later tried to have such marriages with the husband being so much younger than the wife outlawed. The Rajput princess was his third wife, she was 20 days older than the emperor and they were both 20 years old at the time of the marriage. Even though the union was a marriage of political alliance, the role of hormones at that age, even in the 16th century, would have played a role in the development of this relationship. Remember when you were 20 years old! The websites discussing the controversy regarding this movie position themselves according to the politics of the groups that host the site with the Hindu fundamentalists depicting Akbar as a despot and the Muslim sites trivializing the influence of Hindu wives of Akbar on his life and policy. But looking at the chronology, it is true that the emperor abolished the pilgrim tax on the Hindus 1 year after this wedding, and the Jizya tax another year after that. The family of the Hindu Rajput queen were incorporated into the court nobility so she could NOT have been too isolated from her own community. Akbar became a tolerant, pragmatic and liberal (in the modern sense that he focused on the service of religion for people rather than the other way around) leader of enormous economic effectiveness practicing a love of learning and nurturing a society founded on meritocracy. In the movie the monogamy understood in the love of Jodha and the inherent polygamy in the love of the emperor is subtle but apparent. In the love scene song she expresses their passion for each other and he expresses the special meaning she brings to his life (fragrance to flowers he already had in his garden). The movie is a terrific introduction to Mughal India and one that will encourage novices like myself to go to the web over and over and learn about the history of many cultures in general, and just for that, the $31, including the terrific deleted scenes that involve Mahesh Das who later became Birbal,  are well worth it and I thank the director Ashutosh Gowariker for it.",1281744000,3,2722,4.656964656964657

NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE.  THE DVD""S WERE TOP GRADE AS WERE THE RECORDINGS AND THE SUBTITLES WERE THE BEST I""VE EVER SEEN. THE STORY IS FASCINATING AND THE FILMING BREATHTAKING.

3123408,5,B001450KCS,"This film is different from other Bollywood movies I've seen. It's an historic epic, a rich tapestry of mid-16th century Hindustan (India).  I must say I was very impressed.  The cinematography, costumes, set design were outstanding.  The two religions, Islam and Hindu, were treated with sensitivity and respect.
Indian stars, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai, were totally believable as the great Muslim emperor and his unwilling Hindi bride.  Also, they are both beautiful to look at.  And what chemistry!  If you're a female, a couple of scenes will make you swoon...seriously.
Supporting roles were also well acted (except in a few instances when it might have been a little much).  Those are minor faults and easily overlooked.
Indians love their music and dancing and here, both were appropriate and integral to the story.  Quite lovely actually.
Bottom line...if you like a movie that's luscious, romantic, full of action and drama, you will LOVE

 An 'Epic' film in every way and the wonderful Utv 3-disc DVD collection is not the horrible DVD that some reviewers complained about.

 I borrowed this from my library,and then had to immediately order my own copy the next morning. It is definitely a 'keeper' that you will want to add to your movie collection.

 A wonderful story with the beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and the most gorgeous man alive IMHO- Hrithik Roshan will become a treasure that you are glad to own.",1273104000,5,656,4.7105263157894735

3123415,2,B001450KCS,"I like Hrithik Roshan, and I like Aishwarya Rai too. I didn't like this movie as much as either of them.

Any Hrithik movie without him dancing *a lot* already gets a stroke against it - he's such a good dancer it's almost a crime to not stuff his crazy dance moves into every frame - and there wasn't enough Hrithik dancing here. I realise this is a serious movie, as Akbar is almost deified by some, but I was still disappointed.

Hrithik also has a tendency to overact, although because this is a period piece it is almost appropriate that he does.

Aish does her thing with pouty competence. Her outfits are truly glorious; she looks every inch the queen.

The history is butchered, the acting is fine but not stellar, but I must admit it is nice to see this amount of money thrown at an Indian period piece. Visually, it dazzles. But that's about all it has going for it.",1266278400,2,876,4.355828220858895

It was disappointing.",1265760000,,164,4.892857142857143
3123417,4,B001450KCS,"I decided to watch this movie because it was a highly rated Netflix instant watch that I thought may be worth a watch. It is 3.36 hours long, so you may have to take it in bites. It is primarily a ""based-on-truth"" historical romance and best watched irrelevant to historical accuracy. The director did say it was 70 percent fictionalized, but surrounds accurate historical events.

It is a love story between an allianced couple in the mid-1500's, he is Mogul (Muslim) and she is Hindu and his goal is to bring the lands together by the behest of her father. There are some excellent underlying themes that strongly appealed to me. Akbar's attempt to create peace through mercy (which reminded me a little of Ghandi), his determination that a land that welcomes all faiths will be respected and strong, and the honest purity and the patience he shows in his blossoming love for Jodhaa. In the end, it is very very romantic with much historical involvement and geography. It is spoken in Arabic and subtitled.

That being said, the cinematography ranges in everything from excellent to fair throughout. Some scenes are exquisite, yet some appear to take away from the movie as a whole. I think that there is something in this for men, if there is a date night. It's the length of the movie that would be daunting, but there is intrigue, deception, battles, and hand-to-hand combat that appealed to my husband. I varied in my reaction to the movie throughout, yet most of the things that did not appeal are probably of cultural difference.

I am very new to Bollywood movies and did not care for ""Bride and Prejudice"", and the honesty is that I thought I would be turning this movie off early......yet I was drawn in and found myself delightfully immersed and will wonder if anyone else will dream of yellow flower petals, the scent of cumin, and the music of India as I did. : )",1264032000,,1877,4.647590361445783

The film has war elephants, whirling dervishes and a sassy Hindu eunuch.  Now, that's entertainment.  There's nothing like seeing an historical costume drama that was filmed at the very palaces and fortresses where the history took place.  The story is pedestrian: Moghul emperor finds Rajputi princess, Moghul emperor loses Rajputi princess, Moghul emperor gets Rajputi princess back.  However, it is told in an appealing way interwoven into a theme of religious tolerance that speaks to today's India, not to mention the rest of the world.",1260316800,2,660,5.278846153846154

This one is one of my favourites. Of course Hrithik is absolutely gorgeous, and Aishwarya is her usual stunning self. The chemistry between them really makes the film believable.  What I loved the most was the subtle romance between the two, there was no need for explicit scenes to get the message across to the viewer that the two were falling in love. The acting was superb. I could literally feel the emotion coming out of the screen.  I actually don't mind the subtitles, I think it would spoil the ""atmosphere' of the movie if it was dubbed.  I love the sound of the language the men speak so passionately, and the women are so feminine.  This was a wonderful way to spend a lazy afternoon!  I am fast becoming addicted to Bollywood movies.

I can't get the colors and the imagery out of my head.  I bought it because my sister in law raved about it and I'm so glad I did.

We had rented the movie via Netflix before buying it on Amazon, and the picture was great on the rental. So I thought worst case scenario I'd support the artists by buying the discs, then if quality was too awful I'd get a pirated version somewhere else. Not my style but I really liked the movie.
But the quality was just fine, plus there are some bonus postcards that were kind of a cool surprise.
I don't have a widescreen TV to skew the image and I didn't see the theatrical release of the movie to miss any songs, so for the average consumer like me I think it's a good buy.
Note the third ""extras"" disc was not so good quality and there were some interview subjects whose audio was so muffled we had no idea what they were saying. It didn't detract from our enjoyment of the movie and we are still glad we bought the three-disc collector's edition.

3123433,5,B001450KCS,"The film has a epic proportion and provides the viewer with 3.20 hours of an delight experience.
  Does the viewer of today have the patience to watch a really lengthy film in today's times? But once into Jodhaa Akbar, the sequence of events, the drama, the romance, the war... every aspect keeps you mesmerized. Oh yes, the length does pinch you at one crucial point [second hour, which is relatively shorter], when a song breaks out. Otherwise, the 3 + hours are very well spent.

When you watch historicals like Mughal-E-Azam and Razia Sultan, the usage of chaste Urdu is difficult to comprehend at times. Not here! The language is simplified - Akbar speaks in Urdu, Jodhaa in Hindi - and it's easy to decipher.

As a cinematic experience, it would be wrong to compare Jodhaa Akbar to any of Ashutosh Gowariker's previous endeavors. Why, it would be erroneous to compare the film with any film ever made before in this genre. This one stands out and stands out the tallest.

Set in the sixteenth century, Jodhaa Akbar is a love story about a marriage of alliance that gave birth to true love between a great Mughal emperor, Akbar, and a Rajput princess, Jodhaa. Little did Akbar [Hrithik Roshan] know that when he married Jodhaa [Aishwarya Rai Bachchan], he would be embarking upon a new journey -- the journey of true love.

The daughter of King Bharmal of Amer [Kulbhushan Kharbanda], Jodhaa resented being reduced to a mere political pawn in this marriage of alliance, and Akbar's biggest challenge now did not merely lie in winning battles, but in winning the love of this defiant princess.

One of the prime reasons why Jodhaa Akbar works is because the present-day viewer is unaware of the romance between Akbar and Jodhaa. Sure, we all know of Akbar as a great emperor, but the love story makes for a refreshing subject. And the execution of a number of sequences makes Jodhaa Akbar extremely special.

Some instances:

  * The huge cast, with beautiful costumes.
  * The war sequence at the very outset. You realise the scale and magnitude of the film at the very beginning.
  * Hrithik taming an out-of-control elephant. It's hair-raising.
  * The use of a lot of well-painted elephants.
  * The sword fight the very next morning, between Hrithik and Ash.
  * The Azeem-o-Shaan Shahenshah track, when the entire kingdom hails Hrithik.
  * The fight in the climax [reminds you of the fight between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana in Troy].",1242777600,8,2442,4.761904761904762
3123434,5,B001450KCS,"There have been many comments about the lackluster quality of the DVD, and so my review shall focus on the movie itself [with the hope that all the flaws of the DVD shall be addressed in  future DVD releases of this amazing movie].

The film ""Jodhaa Akbar"" is an ambitious project even by Bollywood standards, for historical and period movies are quite hard to pull off and draw the masses. However, ""Jodhaa Akbar"" is one of the rare exceptions - even at more than 3 hrs in length, the story unfolds in such a manner as to draw in and engage the viewer's attention, with most of the movie focusing on the evolving relationship between Emperor Akbar and his consort Jodhaa Bai. The storyline is based on a little known story in history, that of Muslim Akbar's marriage and relationship with the Hindu-born Princess Jodhaa. The time period is sometime in the 16th century, where Emperor Akbar [Hrithik Roshan] marries a Hindu Rajput princess, Jodhaa [Aishwarya Rai]in order to cement an alliance between the Muslim Mughals and the Hindus. As the daughter of King Bharmal of Amer [Kulbushan Kharbanda], the strong-willed Jodhaa refuses to go meekly to her fate, and demands that Akbar agree to two wishes before agreeing to the marriage, one that she be allowed to keep her Hindu religion and not be forced to convert [in Islam, marriage between a Muslim and non-Muslim requires the non-Muslim to convert in order for the marriage to be considered legal], and second, that she be allowed to erect a shrine in her quarters dedicated to Lord Krishna. Akbar agrees, but is later frustrated when his attempts at intimacy are rebuffed by Jodhaa, who wishes for more time to get to know her new husband.

Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai credibly portray the royal couple who try to adapt to each other's customs and give and take, even though it is Jodhaa who is most put upon, considering she has to leave her family and friends behind for a strange new life in a Mughal palace, and where she is welcomed by new friends [Akbar's birth mother] and rebuffed by foes [Akbar's wet nurse and Minister in his goverment, a bitter old woman who is very antagonistic towards Jodhaa]. Akbar, as portrayed by Hrithik Roshan, comes across as a visionary leader before his time, who sets an admirable example by marriage, in order to bridge the chasm between the Muslims and Hindus in India. His style of governance is firm, yet incredibly tolerant, and he deals with his opponents in a fair and just manner.

Aishwarya Rai's Jodhaa is luminously beautiful [and honestly, I can't imagine any other contemporary Bollywood actress portraying this role]. She comes across as fiery and gentle, a contradiction of sorts, yet her facial expressions and mannerisms effectively portray the thawing in her feelings towards her powerful and equally determined spouse. What starts off as a purely political alliance and marriage of convenience slowly evolves into a true marriage based upon love, tolerance and compromise. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie [and there are many such dramatic scenes that pack an emotional punch] is the sword duel between a thinly-disguised Jodhaa and Akbar. Their chemistry is so palpable that one ceases to remember that these are two actors playing roles in a movie.

Besides the credible acting by the two leads, there are many other strengths in this movie, most notably the beautiful cinematography and the stirring music [unlike many Bollywood productions, the songs here do not interfere with the plot]. One of my favorite song sequences in this movie is the one that has the Sufi master singing praises, complemented by a Sufi dance performance. Akbar joins in, portraying his own spiritual release and this comes across so beautifully in showing the deeply spiritual aspect of Akbar's character.

The gorgeous costumes and jewelry are additional eye candy, as are the beautiful and authentic looking sets. All in all, ""Jodhaa Akbar"" delivers all that one could expect from a historical period drama - the casting is excellent, and the direction assured. Highly recommended!",1242000000,11,4096,4.937590711175617

Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai give a top quality performance. I showed this movie to 8th grade boys and they had never seen a movie with subtitles and each day they raced into class to see the movie.

My students even started humming the tunes of the songs throughout the day. The tunes were quite catchy and hard to remove from memory. Oddly, we would find ourselves humming a tune down the halls and run into each other and laugh that we were singing the same tune.

My copy of this movie has three DVD's and I love the cover. The color is vibrate and inviting. The cinematography of this movie is breathtaking to say the least.

A lovestory that can teach us even today how to be compassionate and understanding about different cultures and religions!

3123442,4,B001450KCS,"When I saw my first Bollywood film, it took a while to figure out what in the heck was going on. The film itself wasn't labeled a musical, and my previous exposure to films centered in or around India were limited to Gandhi and Monsoon Wedding...neither of which is shot in a true Bollywood style. After getting past my initial wtf, I've learned to enjoy these (mostly) cheerful excursions of song and dance, but I do admit that they have a habit of momentarily taking me out of the plot of the story. Sometimes it's just so vastly different from the emotional or physical pacing of the film, or the musical number begins to incorporate themes (fountains, springs, birds, etc...) that just materialize from seemingly nowhere. And yes, I now know that the Bollywood genre uses these images as a ""substitute"" or symbol of attraction, etc...but that doesn't change the fact that while I enjoy them, they can be distracting and break the film up a bit. That's just this Westerner's experience.

HOWEVER...I got very little of that in Jodhaa. The song routines fit each scene. The dancing was incorporated into the plot. And the songs themselves...OMG...hauntingly beautiful and in a style that fit the period of the piece. Needless to say, I bought the soundtrack too. The film isn't as far from Bollywood as Monsoon Wedding, but it uses the musical numbers as an enrichment tool without taking the audience out of the film. There's some lip synching, but usually in tender moments, not throughout the entire number, and with purpose: the song lyrics (thank goodness for subtitles) emote what the speaker is feeling without having him/her turn into ""the Indian version of MC Hammer."" ;) Btw, that last bit wasn't an insult to the genre but the use of one of my favorite quotes from Bride and Prejudice.

In fact, the only parts of sound that didn't like were what I called the Dramatic Chipmonk moments. Anyone who is a YouTube fan should know to what I refer. That overly dramatic musical score consisting of barely a few notes and coupled with a piercing glare...usually from Akbar. Oiy! The cheese was running a bit high for me in those moments, and it seemed like they did it ALL the time. LOL

Overall, I thought it was an excellent movie. The costumes, the love story, the humorous moments that reminded me of the wonderful, innocent love-play between two characters from films like It Happened One Night. And the chemistry between the two leads was just sizzling! What wonderful actors. Both have such a fantastic way of expressing with their looks and actions. I still smile whenever I think about the scene in which Akbar finds himself embarrassed to be staring at his wife or Jodhaa's look of fascination/lust tinged with embarrassment when she spies her husband working on his swordsmanship. Whew! That scene alone is worth the purchase price. ;-)

I really don't think this film fits perfectly into the Bollywood ideal. It branches out with a more subtle mix of what makes Bollywood so fun and glamorous but with more (dare I say) relevance to its musical numbers which i think could really make it appeal to a Western audience. While there may currently be more Indian fans than not, if this film is the example of the new face of Bollywood, I see it truly expanding to encompass a more global audience.

But while the quality of the film was superb, I had to subtract one star for the actual dvd format. It's most annoying feature is that you cannot access the main menu until the opening scenes/commercials for the dvd production companies are played. Easily got around by simply popping the disc in and doing an errand or so until it runs its course, but what's really aggrevating is that it's on all the disks...including the second part of the story. A really bad choice on their part. The portion after intermission should jump right to the next scene, otherwise it jars the audience out of the flow of the film.

Mr. Roshan's facial expressions could tell every emotion that was needed. I'm from the US, so I had to read the subtitles and I had no problems understanding any part of the movie. Since then, I've made it a point of seeing other foriegn movies with and without  Mr. Roshan. Dhoom 2 was wonderful! I am a definite fan of his. His acting and facial expressions and of course his dancing is superb. I'm tired to death of our American films. They keep doing the same ones, over and over.

The story is a beautiful romantic tale embedded in a period piece of the relationship between the Mughals and the Hindu Rajput dynasties.  Ashwarya Rai is stunning in her simple glances and few words.  Hrithik Roshan steals the show with his passion, intensity, and ability to take the viewer into a time where so much was going on in India... and extends credibility to his role as Akbar the Great and makes us love him.

I have seen this film THREE times in its entirety with my parents, aunts, cousins, etc - and have seen clips of it many times more.  Watch the DVD deleted scenes - it includes a really nice folksy tale of how Birbal the Wise joined the court of Akbar (a childhood tale re-enacted).

The song ""Inn Lamhon ke Daaman Mein"" is haunting and will cause goose bump.  Listen to it in its entirety and appreciate the Urdu-poetry and exquisite verses.  The video for ""Azeem-o-Shaan-Shahensah"" is a beautiful representation of the secular and beautiful diversity of the tribes of India.

It is basically a beautiful evolving love story that is very 'from the heart'. It is also about a great and good ruler who is wise, caring and had unusually high principles for his times..
It is sumptuous and shot in some stunning palaces and sets.
There are some battle scenes but they are short and symbolically violent rather than going on about realism as Hollywood seems to prefer (and I avoid thesedays). Some may not like the lack of realsim in that but frankly I got the point long ago about war and I don't need to see gut-wrenching images to drive that point further home. This isn't about war even though old power struggles and conspiracies are part of the times and woven in.
The ending is satisfying and the film reminds you about the higher points of being loving, wise and evolved as a human being.
The music is more subtle and traditional and Hithrik doesnt get to dance yet the music is also evocative and I tracked it down for its own merits even though I usually prefer the upbeat catchy Indian music. Hrithik is just so well cast here and does an incredibly good job. He won many awards for this portrayal and deserved them. Aishwarya Rey-Bachchan is also beautifully cast.
Even the English subtitles are credited with the name of the translator. Rightly so as the words are poetic and beautiful.
Very fine performances from Hithrik and Ashwairya who were born for these roles.

3123450,5,B001450KCS,"I watched this movie twice and I am still telling people about it. The charm of this movie doesn't leave one's mind. I found part of its appeal in that they didn't dwell on the fighting that was going on during that period. They showed some and enough to show the Emperor's good judgment as far as dealing with his subjects and especially those he had conquered. It was refreshing to see his religious tolerance and respect for his new wife.  The fact that he abided with her wishes concerning her faith made his views far before his time. I know there were inaccuracies as far as historically but it was not a documentary.

I was awestruck watching this movie.  The acting was outstanding on the level of Best Actor for Roshon. As a lay person I would not notice technical things but the overall scope of the film. It was lavish and gave a good idea of what life was like in that time and place as far as the cultural differences and the political intrigue.

3357686,5,B001450KCS,"It's not often that a movie of this caliber comes along from any country, but thankfully one has! I don't go see movies at a theatre often, but this movie showed me  how a really great movie can touch you in so many ways and yes, bring a lot of joy!

Take a tumultuous and interesting period in Indian history (the 1500's, when the young Muslim Mughal emperor Akbar is still consolidating control over the various kingdoms of northern India), add a fascinating story of his politically based marriage (taboo until then) to the Hindu princess Jodhaa, have two of the most stunning human beings (Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai) play the leads, and with SERIOUS romantic sizzle between them... add beautiful locations (forts and courts of Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi), exquisite interiors, sumptuous costumes and exquisite jewelery (who would have had more?)... and not least, envelop the whole thing in AR Rahman's unforgettable music, and you have Jodhaa Akbar!

Akbar, for those who don't know, is known in history as ""Akbar the great"", for many reasons, especially his (novel) tolerance of non-Muslims.  This movie shows some of the seeds of his tolerant stand towards non-Muslims, something very different from his predecessors and contemporaries.  He seems to have been a multi-faceted man, known both as a great warrior as well as for his encouragement of the fine arts in his court.  His heir was born to his Hindu Rajput wife, here (and historically) known as Jodhaa.

This is my first time seeing Hrithik Roshan, and I'm amazed how perfect and appealing he is in this role. He is both quietly regal and seriously magnetic!  He's great!  I now understand why there was ""Hrithik-mania"" in India when he started acting!

The movie shows how this couple eventually go past their cultural and religious differences to build trust and love. Hrithik and Aishwarya bring Akbar and Jodhaa and their mutual fascination and wariness so convincingly to the screen (but then, who would not be fascinated with one of them as your spouse?).  The final scene has to be one of THE most romantic scenes I've ever seen! It's breathtaking, especially with the music. It exemplifies that you can develop extreme sensuality without ""R"" rated scenes if you know what you're doing.

A R Rahman's score is fabulous and evocative. Khwajaa mere khwajaa, Mann Mohana and Inn Lamahon are instant classics and add so much to the depth and beautiful texture of this movie.  Unlike standard Indian movies, where the music may distract from the movie, the few choice songs in this movie add to and tie together the movie.  I now want to look for more AR Rahman music (and I know there's tons for this superstar music director).

Oh yes, for those looking for action - there are exciting battle scenes and sword fights.  Elephants and camels going to war!  It was fun to see helmets and shields of the type I've seen at the National Museum in Delhi actually being used in this movie.  And to see the various forts being used as they would have been 500 years ago was magical!  History indeed sprang to life, and so excitingly.

The whole movie team has done a great job - a coherent plot beautifully executed (a rarity in any movie, whether Western or Indian), stunningly photographed and edited, with stars you can watch all day and music that stays with you, altogether draw you in and keep you engrossed for the whole 3+ hours (there is an intermission at the theatre). Although there's plenty of fiction that the writers had to develop (since they admit there's no real info on this pair's private life), there's also plenty of real history shown in this movie, including interesting small details.  It made me do a lot of web searching afterward on various related topics.

I'm really happy to see an Indian movie be both deeply Indian and produced so compellingly and professionally - something that older Indian movies, which often had good stories and great music, but often kept going long after the plot had run out really missed out on.  The plot and story line are tight and the editing is fabulous.

The biggest compliment I can give is that rather than watching a made up movie, I felt like I was actually watching them living their real lives! That certainly doesn't happen too often! I've enjoyed it so much, that I've driven 100 miles round trip twice in one week to see it on the big screen!

This movie should be showing at mainstream theaters in the US.  Friends of all backgrounds enjoyed the soundtrack so much that they want to see the movie. I only hope Oscar's paying attention - this is much higher order movie making than 99% of the stuff out anywhere.

Hollywood can take many lessons from Mr. Gowariker (the director), including on how to develop romance on screen, something (along with humanity and warmth) that's really missing in most western movies these days.  Too many of today's movies are busy blasting us out of the theatre with the noise level, cutting from scene to scene so quickly as to almost  bring on seizures (as well as make us miss out on what's going on) and general contrivance and predictability.

See it at the theater first if you possibly can (it's too big and beautiful to squeeze into the small screen - you're going to be missing out on a lot!), or at least on the dvd if you can't, but don't miss it - it's too much fun, and it's the closest we can come to time travel to the 1500's!!

BTW, it thankfully has good English subtitles (other than for the song ""Inn Lamahon"", where the subtitles make no sense at all)!  There are websites that give both song lyrics and their English translation that add to your enjoyment.  I give it two thumbs and two big toes up too!

3357689,3,B001450KCS,"Hrithik has been my favourite of the lot of Indian actors and let me tell you he's very good and so are the rest of them. He was recently quoted as saying, ""I do not want to be amidst mediocrity."" I like him for saying that. After Dhoom 2, he perhaps wanted to break away from the ""cool guy"" image and do something a bit more Braveheartish or oulandish. A million people awaited this film in my city alone. The audience looked a bit trapped and worried during the interval wondering what the second half would bring.

It is an extraordinarily long film and unlike Lagaan, it doesn't really captivate as it becomes a tad too self involved with it's ""epic romance"" genre. That said, I must credit Aiswarya Rai on quite a good performance. The rest of the star cast were ok, there were a few new acts and due to similar faces, it also became a difficult to keep track with the them and the storyline, which in itself isn't all that intriguing.

There was some hunky dory chemistry between Hrithik and Aish. A bollywood film is nothing without the music and the songs, each and every one of them, were/was very good. But then tell me...have we not seen this before in nother films? JA will appeal to a certain audience while I can't help but feel it insulted my blind trust in a Hrithik Roshan film.

While Hrithik's act is good, I usually expect excellence from him, so he was a bit disappointing. Am I being cynical, I don't know, but this film is really really average.

When you're watching a film based on a king, you expect to see a bit more prudence on part of the film-maker with regards to how the king rules, his administration, his ways, his character pecularities, this film is short-sighted when you take into account what Akbar, the king was. Now, come on, I know it's supposed to be a different genre but quite apologetic considering little was incorporated of that.

I think this film will bomb but it's ok, one must learn.
Do watch this film but don't even expect an ""Alexander"" (which was slighty above average mind you) [...] says it's an 8/10, I'd say barely 6.

3357690,5,B001450KCS,"Watching this instant masterpiece from India, its unbelievable that the world has yet to take note of the industrys' obvious genius. ""Jodhaa Akbar"", a 3.5 hour long epic that works both as a love story, as well as a religious tolerance message, is prime example of how Bollywood is infinitely more creative, colorful and luminous than Hollywood. The film takes us back to the times when movies like ""Gone with the Wind"" were made - but with better looking actors, better music, better direction, and a budget that could sink the Titanic.

My favorite thing about this movie is Aishwarya Rai (now Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan). This is an actress who starred in this decades' best Hindi film thus far (""Devdas""), and also headlined the best Bengali film of the decade (the underrated ""Chokher Bali""). I saw it for her, and rediscovered the worlds' most beautiful woman. Seriously, is she even human? Aishwarya is beyond a perfect being - its as if the heavens and the stars and some alien DNA all combined to create one spectacular vision. Take it from me - no human woman, before or after, will ever look as good as Aishwarya does in this film. And re-reading that line, Im afraid it still doesn't do justice to her unsurpassed beauty. Indian women are where its at.

Hrithik Roshan plays the King Akbar, but I found much to like about this otherwise wooden actor. The film has a few scenes that stand out way after the movie is over, and if you're into researching and studying film as a passion or a hobby, this movie is tailormade to cater to your sensibilities. Despite both actors being in their mid-30s, their unique love story burns with the incandescence of a teenage romance. The director is especially successful in providing different shades to the character of Jodhaa - Aishwarya goes from warrior princess who excels at sword-fighting, to a bhajan-singing housewife - all within an hour. The scene where she faces off with her mother in law over who rules the kitchen (and thus the heart of her man) is my special favorite.

Ultimately, the film succeeds for me because its not frivolous. It would have been so easy to make a beautiful looking movie and doll it up, but this one actually has a message. However, if you're not Indian and you're reading this review, the magnitude of the films' message would perhaps be lost upon you. The fact that a conservative Hindu princess entered a completely Muslim household almost 500 years ago is utterly fascinating. How did she survive there? Did they try to convert her to Islam? The movie addresses all this. I loved how the Jodhaa character refuses to accept Islam as her own religion, though she respects it from afar. The couple get married with Hindu and Muslim rites, one after the other, and the story chronicles how the fact that they came from two different religions had nothing to do with what they felt for each other.

The music - well, this soundtrack admittedly has no standout tracks upon first listen, and you simply have to watch the film to appreciate the album. Its mood music, and Rahman has done a wonderful job at it. The track where Jodhaa and Akbar consummate their marriage is unique and touching, primarily because of the way its shot. Gowariker, as ever the perfectionist extracts nuanced performances from all concerned. But the film belongs ultimately to Aishwarya Rai, who proves beyond a doubt that she is the most luminous actress on screen in any part of the world. Yes, she isn't a seasoned actress like Meryl Streep, but look at her. What eyes! What lips! What a fascinating specimen of how incredible human genes can be! Her role as Jodhaa propelled her, in my mind, to the very top of the list of actresses in the world today who are actually worth watching.

A five star epic? Yes. Its not better than other Indian classics such as ""Mughal E Azam"", but this is easily the best film India has released in the last twenty years. I highly suggest you track this down and watch it on the big screen while you can, because its worth every second of it. I'll certainly be buying the DVD as well as the CD - this is a film to watch with your family - and put it on repeat. A modern masterpiece.",1203379200,39,4178,4.632928475033738

Beautiful costumes and settings. Excellent photography. Acting fine. The music was fine, though not as impressive as I had been led to believe. But then I am a westerner, and most like Indian classical.

There were some memorable scenes -- like battles with elephants, and a Sufi musical piece. All in all, enjoyable. Well done. 3 disc version. I did not think that the extra features added much. But a couple of deleted scenes added depth. So, okay.",1443139200,,692,4.617886178861789

I love Aishwarya Rai, but she's not my favorite. I appreciate this Bollywood film because there are no silly scenes in this film at all.  Bollywood is notorious for adding dumb humor into films, even serious films, so thank you for not making this film have any dumb humor scenes.

It is worth watching for the lush scenery and amazing costumes alone.  I have confidence the historical based storyline will grab your attention.  This movie seems to have something for everybody.  At the heart of the three plus hour movie is a truly compelling love story.  For those who like ""royal court intrigue"" there are several subplots of treachery, rebellion and war to keep your interest.  There is some lovely music, but if you're looking for the trademark Bollywood song and dance numbers, I'm afraid this movie hasn't any.  This picture is very family friendly.  Despite the scenes of warfare, there are no dismembered bloodied corpses prominently displayed.  There are no sex scenes and there's no cursing.

Jodhaa Akbar is probably the best film of Ais Rai's in my opinion and this is probably the first film that made everyone sit up and notice Hrithik Roshan and ushered him into the big league of ""IT"" men.  He is a great actor and fantastic model, dancer.  Watch this film then Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (hope I spelled that correctly) then DHOOM2 and then on Youtube on the internet you can catch his dance moves!!  Da Joob Ja Doob or (Come Dance with Me) and Just Dance.  He has the moves like Michael Jackson!!
Also on YouTube his first tv interviews about 14 yrs ago...Rendezvous with Simi Garawal...it's in 2 parts with his parents and there is a later one with his wife, Suzanne.

I won't comment on the quality of the movie itself as far as story, acting, etc. because that's been covered well elsewhere but will say that the cinematography and costumes are jaw-droppingly gorgeous.  Mostly I want to reinforce that the Blu-ray version is fantastic.  The spoken language is Hindi and there are subtitles in English and Arabic.  The English subtitles worked perfectly and were always visible.  Audio is crisp and clear.  The second disc of extras seemed a bit sparse for Blu-ray but oh well, can't have everything!

The other available Blu-ray edition [[ASIN:B003VL2SQ4 Jodhaa Akbar (Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema / Hindi Film Blu ray DVD) [Blu-ray] is also by UTV Motion Pictures (released July 2, 2010), but is a single disc ALL-REGION version subtitled in English, with a run time of 213 minutes.  Don't know if the extra minute is an accurate piece of information or just a typo, and don't know the quality of the disc, since I have not yet purchased or viewed it.  Also, since this particular edition is SOLD currently (as of April 2013) by India Ethnicity (fulfilled by Amazon) and a couple other Amazon Market Place sellers, I have learned from experience to prefer buying items SOLD and fulfilled ONLY by Amazon, so I think I will wait to buy this edition at a time when it becomes available for purchase directly from Amazon!

3357837,5,B001450KCS,"I am an educator who went looking for a film that would give my American students a little glimpse of Hinduism and found this movie on my first search. I watched it, then, my teenage daughter watched it with me, and by word of my mouth, it spread through my entire family of seven.  I had never seen a ""Bollywood"" movie before, but all of us fell in love with this movie, even my 7-year-old daughter,promptly used her allowance to buy an Indian princess Barbie ""that looks just like Jodhaa.""  Not only that, but the music, the traditional dancing, the lavish scenery and so much physical beauty and good chemistry between the two stars, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai made us wonder if these people were even human.  We downloaded the soundtrack and have watched this film again and again. The song, ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" is one of the best moments in the movie.

One of the features of ""Bollywood"" that I appreciate, besides the gentle romance, comedic moments and memorable music, is that it is generally very clean.  It's so refreshing to see a film that my younger children can wander into the room and see and not have to worry about.  This has opened the door for our family to see a number of other Hindi films since discovering this one.

As to the historicity of the film, all I know is that the film is based upon the life and rule of Mughal emperor Akbar the Great who married a Hindu princess and promoted an early form of religious pluralism.  Enjoy!",1365120000,3,1464,4.518939393939394

3357839,5,B001450KCS,"Pros: The spectacle of this film has most in common with classic macro-productions like El Cid, Ben Hur, Cleopatra, and The Ten Commandments. The leads have great chemistry, and the intrigues are on par with other imperial stories like Ran or Cromwell. It does not overindulge in musical numbers, but has singing and underscoring to fit the theme. I particularly like the racial and religious tensions played out here, as it illuminates much of the conflict between Islamic and Hindu peoples that carried on well into the 20th century. The action is well-paced, if you are prepared for its epic length and high vision, and the sets are phenomenal, often shot on location. There are also some epic fight scenes of medieval combat, complete with elephant cavalry.

Cons: For a few minutes, neither of the leads is on screen, and then they spend a good deal of time in separate storylines. This is the plot, but when they are together, the romance and tragedy really sparkles. There are definitely some good fight scenes and at least one compelling supporting role to get your through this first bit, but I think it is the weakest part of the film.

Synopsis: As I love big historic dramas, I really liked this. I expected it to be good, but it really eschewed all camp and pageantry to tell a grand story. I could easily share this with older and younger generations because it is so well done.",1362787200,4,1392,4.700819672131147

Roshan hams it up a bit less than usual - I was pleasantly surprised to see him pull off this more serious non-action, non-hearthrob role much better than I expected. It seems like the production team took pains to invest time and quality in the set design, costumes and battle sequences to give the film an authentic historical look (I can't say with confidence that it's 100% historically accurate but it looks that way). And where other than Bollywood could the filmmakers ever film battle scenes with troupes of battle elephants that aren't CGI? Good stuff!",1362096000,3,713,4.95

First things first, FORGET ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT BOLLYWOOD! It no longer applies.

There's only one person ultimately responsible for this exquisite experience. Ashutosh Gowariker is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He's creates images on film that are heartbreakingly beautiful, combines them with master storytelling, and coaxes performances from the cast that defies all expectations. I have a goal to see every film he's made thus far, and the three I've seen I'd recommend to anyone! There isn't a single detail of this film he to chance, and the result is as close to perfection as a human can get. Each frame of the movie is so gorgeous you want them to be oil paintings to hang in your house. More on that when I deal with the special features...

This movie caused a huge ruckus when it opened because of historical controversy. Being a history buff, I did some research (yes I'm weird) and while the movie did take some liberties, and leaves many things out, it gets more right than it does wrong! Besides, if it had been 100% accurate and included *everything* it would have been a nine hour movie, and would've gotten a little depressing! Movies are meant to entertain, so keep an open mind. Brushing mundane reality aside, let's focus on the world Ashutosh Gowariker so generously gave us. I can't think of many movies that look and sound as beautiful as this one is. The sets, locations, the costumes, the music, the sounds of the swords clashing, the horses, the elephants, the jewelry!!!! (I'm a girly-girl when it comes to the pretties) the food... Even if you watch this movie on mute, it's an experience, but in the name of anything sacred DON'T DO THAT!

The music is transforming! I'm not exaggerating, when I hear the first strains of ""Jashn-E-Bahaara"" anything negative in my life disappears. I'm serious it's the best painkiller I know of. I would dance to  ""Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah"" all day if I could do it. More on that song later... There are two songs that I would call hymns ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" (Islamic) and ""Mann Mohana"" (Hindu) but as I'm neither Hindu nor Muslim, I hope I haven't offended anyone. Regardless of how to classify them the music is exquisite and the lyrics really highlight Akbar's devotion to his faith, and Jodhaa's integrity and devotion to hers. A little fun trivia for you is that,  Haidar Ali (the writer) has a cameo of a Sufi who leads his group in singing ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" after the Islamic wedding ceremony.  For sheer passion and the rapture of *finally* being in the arms of your love, you simply cannot top ""In Lamhon Ke Daaman Mein"" its honeymoon music to the tenth power!

Again, check your assumptions about Bollywood song and dance at the door. Here the actors do very little singing, (okay they're dubbed who cares!) Jodhaa sings to pray, and has a verse in the ""honeymoon song"" in which she does a pretty twirl. Jalal has a pretty little verse of poetry he sings in Urdu in the ""honeymoon song"" as for dancing, he also has a pretty twirl in ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" but that's it! Azeem-O-Shaan Shahensha is an epic dance number with one thousand people, that would make Bugsby Berkley go green with envy, but unlike most epic numbers in Bollywood, it does not take the form of a music video! Unlike with his masterpiece ""Swades"" Mr. Gowariker doesn't heed the typical sensibilities for using music to tell the love story; it's a masterstroke keeping everything in proper historical context, and preventing the actors from breaking character.

The background score is also beautiful and varied. The only thing that stops it from being the absolute best score I've ever heard is merely a few notes that play whenever some fool gets Jalal angry, I mean come on Mr. Roshan's eyes take care of that entirely on their own!

Horses and doves, parrots and bunnies, camels and elephants OH MY! The gang's all here and it's great! Out with the old theater adage ""Never work with children or animals"" without them this movie would feel flat! Whether it's Jodhaa cooing with doves, bunnies, and setting her parrots free, or Jalal riding his white horse into battle, and blowing off the stress of being Shahensha (Emperor) by taming a wild elephant, you will be awed with it all and wonder, ""How in the world did they keep it all under control?""

A caution to parents... Dear responsible, loving parents, Most of the elephants in this movie are used during battle scenes, and a few crush some soldiers even stepping on their heads. Now, I personally believe that most kids over the age of five see worse on most previews and commercials here in the USA, but I strongly urge you to view the scenes first before sitting down with the munchkins. When my nephews visit, I skip them entirely. Your's Respectfully Warpgirl.

The costume designer Neeta Lulla and jewelers Tanishq turn everyone into people who inhabit a time and a place of lost grandeur. Okay, you might have seen Ms. Rai-Bachchan with a similar look in some of her big period films but I doubt it. I'll let you know when I see them for myself. I am certain you've *never* seen Mr. Roshan draped in silk, and brocade dripping with diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds! They used the real deal here! Two kilograms for his gold and ruby sword alone! In case you're wondering he's pulls it off effortlessly. If this movie had been submitted for Oscar consideration it would have won a boatload, but Costumes would be a definite lock! Special kudos to the makeup department, just flawless. I find makeup to be a bit iffy with Bollywood.

Now, performances! I did warn you this would be long... I watched the movie the first time for Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan so it's only fair I start with her. It boggles my mind that I've read in so many places where people say she can't act! If she can't act, then I must have the wrong idea of what acting is. She uses every part of herself in a role: her voice, the way she walks, the way she eats, heck even the way she sits! Jodhaa is my favorite because she's a lady in her thirties and she's playing a young woman barely twenty and not only does she pull it off, she looks twenty! I don't mean her beautiful face, I mean in her eyes and expression there's innocence and wonder that makes that time of life so special. There are no famous Bollywood histrionics in this movie. Subtle is the name of the game and you must keep most of your focus on the eyes. I recommend the first time you watch this, you read the subtitles, then watch it again and forget them! The biggest emotional impact comes from the characters eyes. Now you'll notice quickly that Ms. Rai-Bachchan is wearing brown contacts for authenticity, but it's a credit to her skill and talent that her emotions shine through like gleaming flames.

Jodhaa is a woman of integrity, it's her defining trait. She treats others with kindness and deep respect, but never backs down about what she believes is right. Even when other people wrong her, she doesn't berate them, or try to get even. She holds herself to high standards with grace and dignity. My favorite scene that *always* makes me cry, (my mom was torments me about it) is when she says Jalal's full name for the first time. Perfection! Nevertheless, probably her most technically brilliant scene is the ""wedding night"" scene. It's jaw dropping!

I had no idea who Hrithik Roshan was, now I can't believe it took me over two decades to discover him! For anyone who finds his ""hunky-grin"" tiring, or thinks of him as ""the dance guy"" *forget it* just forget it all. There's no grinning at all, and I didn't even know the man could dance until Dhoom2! Are there tears? Yes. However, not the typical Bollywood tears made so famous in frothy romances, or melodramas. Like with Jodhaa, subtlety is the key to Mr. Roshan's portrayal of, Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar.

Again he's a man in his thirties playing a young man just turning twenty and he makes it work even though his body is like no twenty year old I've ever seen. He infuses Jalal with idealism, innocence, and the deep venerability of a boy struggling not only to become a man, but also to break free from expectations of the people surrounding him and become a true leader. It's an incredibly complex performance, with layer after layer of technique and emotion.

As written, Akbar is very close to being untouchable. He's so good, so pure, intelligent, compassionate, the bravest, ect. Quite honestly, if Mr. Roshan hadn't kept him solidly on the ground, I'd think the movie is about an angel not a man. ""Akbar's angry tune"" aside, Mr. Roshan adds a hair trigger temper, and a talent for holding a grudge that keeps him refreshingly human. Every scene he does is incredible but the ones that show that he's more than just the ""dancing hunk"" are: first, ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" no dialogue, just the expression of how deeply he reveres his God, and the conviction of his faith. Then, ""the wedding night"" rarely are two actors so in-tune with each other. After that, ""the mother scene"" if your heart doesn't twinge, see a doctor. All men should watch ""the groveling scene"" that's how you do it! ""The patriotic scene"" shows the moment when Jalal takes complete control of his empire and his life and Roshan is statesman and Alpha Male at the same time. However, the crown jewel is the ""do you love me"" scene. It's all in the eyes.

Both actors are brilliant in their own rights, but neither one would have given such amazing performances without the other. Every-so-often, two actors will be put in a film and something happens. The camera becomes a window and suddenly you're not watching a movie anymore. You become a peeping Tom watching two people go through a finite space in time living and everything that comes with their lives. Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai-Bachchan have done three films together, (this is the second) and all of them are completely different, but in every one, you become a voyeur. They don't play roles with each other, they *become* them. I know I sound insane, I feel silly writing it! Just do me a favor watch, ""the sword scene"" and when *the moment* comes, (you'll know it when it happens) try not to gasp when you see the love flowing between them.

 NO, I am NOT saying I think they had an affair! I'm saying, that they're that good! I keep hoping to read they've signed on for a dance extravaganza. It can happen!

Not to be outdone is the fabulous supporting cast! Two women dominate this playing field of massively talented people! First up the only fully fleshed ""villain"" in the story, (more on the bad guys in a minute)... Ila Arun plays the astute Maham Anga. Talk about every young bride's worst nightmare, the possessive Mother Figure! You see Maham Anga was one of Jalal's father's concubines, and  when Jalal's mother went with her husband while they were in exile, they left their son in her care. Later on after Jalal becomes Emperor, mom goes throughout the empire helping while ""Elder Mother"" still looks after him. Now, she's basically in charge of the entire royal court and the only person Jalal will never contradict.

To say she doesn't like the incredibly beautiful Hindu bride Jalal has picked out is an understatement. The minute I saw her on screen I cried out, ""OMG it's the Indian Mrs. Danvers!"" I suppose that means nothing to people who haven't seen or read Rebecca... Google it, if you want. To summarize, Maham Anga is extremely jealous and hates Jodhaa with a passion that boarders on the crazy. Of course, it culminates into something terrible, but it also provides two of the most romantic moments in the movie. If her own machinations aren't bad enough, she has a biological son who causes Jalal misery, so she does double-duty as a villain in this film.

The other amazing woman in this movie is Mrs. Poonam Sinha, who plays Jalal's biological mother Empress Hamida Banu Begum. This is the mother-in-law every bride prays for! Supportive, sweet, a helping hand in a new family, and in Jodhaa's case a new world. She wants her boy happy and can see immediately Jodhaa is exactly what he needs. It's astounding how Mrs. Sinha balances the emotions of her character. She *knows* her son considers another woman to be his ""mother"" yet instead of being bitter about it, she does what she can to help him rule and make sure someone is taking care of Jodhaa when he's busy. Of course, ""the mother scene"" just makes everything better. There is one weird thing, she talks to Jodhaa a lot, but Jodhaa never says a word! I guess her eyes talk for her.

Now bad guys and idiots... I'll be honest, the villainy is not the sharpest of swords in the armory. In a movie with so much going on you end up not caring that they're flat. First up, the spawn of Anga. Adham Khan the jealous, sadistic, amoral, older half-brother. Every family has a bad seed. Adham is an angry guy. First his dad doesn't choose him as a successor, then his mom is obsessed with the runt (the guy is taller than most people) who got it. Personally, I think if his mother had hugged him more he might not have become a traitorous, raping, thief! Don't worry parents, there is no rape in this movie. It comes out in a verbal argument. As far as brains go, he's definitely the stupidest one! Watch and see how stupid!

Now, the family problems don't end there. Jalal also has a pretty older sister named Banu, who has a very nasty husband! Alas, Sharifuddin Hussein wants to be Shahensha too! He does have more brains than Adham, but that's no real achievement. For the most part, he plots in secret and tries to avoid getting his hands dirty until the very end. The person I feel sorry for is Banu, she actually loves the jerk! Don't ask me why, he makes it clear he doesn't return the sentiment. He gets lots of help from other idiots, the head Religious Leader of the Mughal court. This guy hates Jalal's tolerance of things not strictly Islam and the tax reform that hurts his wallet.

The other idiot helper is Raj Sujamal Jodhaa's brother, not really a bad guy in the evil sense, but a true moron! Sujamal is a major player in the movie. He's Jodhaa's first cousin, but they were raised as siblings. She calls him Bhaisab, (older brother) he has her rahki it's all very familial, no romantic subtext at all. The problem lies in politics. Jodhaa's dad inherited the throne from his brother Sujamal's father. Now he hopes his uncle gives him a fair share when the kingdom is divided up on his death. You'll have to watch the movie but let me put it this way, he was stupid to trust Sharifuddin.

The actor who plays Sujamal is Sonu Sood. Apparently, he's a rising star in Bollywood, but he does very little here but mope, whine, and throw temper tantrums. Out of all the negative characters, he's the weak link because he's just so wishy-washy. Who knows, maybe that's the point. His final scene was very touching.

There is ONE tiny flaw in this movie it drives me stark raving bonkers! In the wedding scenes, Jodhaa is decked out in her bridal finery. She's wearing amazing jewelry with a large tikka that lays flat on her forehead during the ceremony, but somehow during ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" it changes to a ""bell"" shaped tikka that rests on top of her hairline!

Now Special Features! On the third disk of this set, you get... Deleted scenes with subtitles! YEY! Hindi lessons courtesy of the sing-along with the songs feature. Lots of movie trailers that hint of other deleted goodies that didn't get put in, (darn!) again with subtitles. An interview with Gowariker addressing the controversy on Historical Accuracy. There's a  little commentary involving all the heavy hitters in the movie. All in English! Mr. Roshan's accent is swoon-worthy. (Okay yes I need a 12-step program or something!) Fair warning, something went wrong with the sound during Mrs. Gowariker's (also a producer) interview. It isn't the DVD itself so don't worry. It sounds like a microphone blew out. Everyone else is as clear as a bell.

Oh remember how I said you'll want to take the images on screen and hang them up? You can! A beautiful set of large postcards also come with the DVD's. Some of the most breataking images are there for pretty pictures! I thought about using them for there intended purpose but they're just too pretty!

Enjoy this beautiful movie! It's a true treasure.",1351382400,7,16555,4.646958304853042

Unfortunately, this ""Three Disc Collector's Edition"" seems to be a bootleg or some kind, with non-anamorphically enhanced video and a cover that, while sumptuous, appears to be a dark copy of the original.

History is rewritten to suit our modern sensibilities - Jodha was neither Akbar's only wife nor a skilled swordswoman who loved cooking and caligraphy, Akbar was not an athletic and handsome ruler with a democratic heart, and the existence of his evil, politically powerful wet nurse is yet to be documented.

The first set played flawlessly, and as I remember too, the DVD quality was stunning! A few years later, I bought another one at a local indian store and I got another winner!  It had two discs just like the first one and the movie was pretty darn lenghty if you ask me, but it didn't matter because it was so intense.  I never had a falling eye on this movie.  I even loaned it to my older sister (we are african american by the way) and showed it to my other family members and enjoyed it also.  Yes, I had to read the subtitles, but they weren't lengthy and stayed on long enough to read at a reasonable speed and still view the beautiful background and the actors as well.  The film quality was on the level of LAGAN if you ask me, and that says alot!  It is a little annoying to have to deal with the UTV start up, but for me, it's worth the little annoyance.  They gotta promote somewhere. I would make sure that if you purchase the DVD set, that you get the exact 2 or 3 disk collectors edition.

Aerial shots accentuated the dance formations & elegant floors. Admirable performances by main actors.  I hadn't seen any Bollywood or period Indian movies before...this was VERY impressive.  The many extras and sense of grandeur reminded me of epics from the Golden Age of Hollywood like ""The Ten Commandments"".  Despite being over 3 hrs long, the film is riveting and you forget the time.

The story is about the historical figure, Jalal Mohammed Akbar (Hrithik Roshan), a wise 16th-century Indian  ruler who unites Hindustan.  When he assumes full power as Mughal emperor at 19 y/o he displays wisdom & compassion combined with strategic planning & discipline.  Jalal, who is Muslim, agrees to a marriage of alliance to promote peace.  His betrothed is the Hindu Princess Jodha of Amer (Aishwarya Rai).  This introduces two of the movie's themes: 1) religious conflict (Muslim vs. Hindu) and 2) the blossoming love between Jalal & Jodha.  The importance of religion in daily life is an integral part of this film.  Jalal shows his wisdom by decreeing tolerance of all religions, not only Islam.  Of course, there are the usual palace intrigues and plots to contend with.  Meanwhile, tension and passion build as love grows between Jalal & Jodha.  When they finally consummate their love the scene is superb!  The incredible lighting & interior combined with tenderness b/w the two actors make the scene intensely sensual (without the overt sexuality often seen in this type of scene - which is a refreshing change).  Roshan & Rai are gorgeous, adding to the beauty of the film...In fact, Roshan is probably one of the most handsome & charismatic men I have seen!!  He gives a passionate performance particularly with his eyes & body language.

Although many people have pointed out that the movie strays from historical accuracy, it is still a beautiful story about a wise leader who bucks tradition and chooses compassion over bloodshed, openness and acceptance over intolerance.  It is also a wonderful love story. Besides, this follows the Hollywood tradition: How accurate was Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra""?

The only reason I didn't give this 5-stars is the singing.  Sometimes it supported the mood of the scene, e.g. Jalal abolishes the Pilgrimage Tax.  There the singing & dance conveyed a sense of celebration.  At other times, it was distracting; music without vocals may have been better.  Also, I'm not a fan of the high-pitched chant-like sound in some of the songs.  Still, this movie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1334793600,2,2668,5.160839160839161

Well..........it's a 3 disc package ( 2 discs are the movie, and 3rd disc is a bonus disc with the caste, directors etc. )Well, only ONE disc played. The other 2 were blank.

The story-line is very good overall - romantic theme, great music, etc. There is some complicated family dynasty history in there, but it doesn't dominate the film.

3357884,5,B001450KCS,"While I've enjoyed some Indian movies, many of the ones I've watched in the past embodied some of the corniest of Bollywood, with the overly dramatic musicals and overacting. Jodhaa Akbar is a great exception. It's epic on the scale of Gladiator or Lawrence of Arabia. The movie follows the first years of the famous Mughal Emperor Akbar and particularly his relationship with his wife Jodhaa. The battles aren't really the focus of the movie but are pretty well done. More importantly, you get the sense that there is a real and budding relationship between Akbar and Jodhaa. The political intrigue is great, with brothers betraying each other and parents marrying their daughters off. My only complaint is that the sound quality (at least watching it on Netflix) didn't match its epic scope (hopefully the DVD is better in this regard).

3357886,5,B001450KCS,"My review is a bit different from the others I've read.  Most of them talk about a visually stunning movie, but what I like most about it is how appropriate it is for my family.  We're white Christian Americans living in a small city in the Western states, so about all the cultural exposure we get are a few restaurants and an immigrant coworker or two.  We recently started watching Bollywood because I wanted to broaden my family's appreciation for art that exists outside our society.  They took to it immediately.

My children are 10 and 12 years old.  Whenever we watch another Bollywood film, they always ask if there will be musical numbers and beautiful costumes.  Jodhaa Akbar was a complete feast for the senses, all the way through.  It enabled us to witness two world religions that are not our own, without negative viewpoints about either one.  Though it doesn't go very far into the dynamics of either religion, and though I've read opinions that it misrepresents both religions, it's a nice introduction to them without muddying the beauty of the faiths with prejudice and negative emotions.  The scene with the Sufis broadened the experience even more.

It's difficult to find modern movies that step outside the common themes of partying and superficial beauty, and still keep a handle on the language, sex, nudity, etc.  We've rarely had to worry about that with Bollywood.  There is a little violence with the war scenes, but it's in context and not too graphic.

In addition, my kids have to read all the subtitles to really note what's going on.  Before they know it, they've read for several hours without a single complaint.  It is a long production, so it may take several evenings to get through it with your family, but it's a highly enriching experience.",1314316800,23,1783,4.777777777777778

3357898,5,B001450KCS,"Director Ashutosh Gowariker--who helmed the Oscar-nominated 'Lagaan' (2001)--transports audiences to another world--a world of courtly romance, legendary battles, and palace intrigue--the 16th-century world of one of history's most fascinating figures, the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great. But 'Jodhaa Akbar' is more than a lavish period piece with sumptuous sets and rich costumes, and more than a love story between captivating characters. Its focus is the Muslim emperor's noble goal of religious tolerance--which was the impetus for his conquest of the Indian subcontinent and his marriage to the Hindu princess Jodhaa.

Akbar the Great was one of the most progressive leaders the world has ever known, and under him, Indian culture flourished. His marriage to Jodhaa--an important political alliance--is an historical fact, but her actual name is a matter of dispute and the details of their relationship are unknown. It's unlikely that they actually shared a great love, as the film purports, given that Akbar had hundreds of wives and concubines and Jodhaa was not even the first among them--a reality the film completely ignores. But no matter--the film's message that differences can be transcended by respect is a powerful one, sadly all too relevant today, and their marriage, loveless or not, was an important first step in making religious solidarity his public policy.

The early years of Akbar's reign are the subject of the film. Akbar (played by Hrithik Roshan) is a young man who has been king since he was a child. He dismisses his regent and assumes control of the government, but he's unsure of himself. While praying, Akbar has an epiphany about how to unite the religious factions in his empire and he makes the controversial decision to marry a Hindu princess. Jodhaa (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) is resistant to the idea, but she agrees to the marriage because he's going to let her keep her religion.

Akbar is soon besotted with his feisty, willful bride, but Jodhaa doesn't feel the same way and she keeps him out of her bedroom. He tries to coax her into consummating their marriage by patiently earning her trust and--the film isn't all earnest idealism--by showing off his incredible body. Meanwhile, palace insiders, who would like the country to remain religiously divided, keep trying to drive them apart.

The later years of Akbar's reign--and his contentious relationship with his son Salim--are the subject of the Bollywood classic 'Mughal-E-Azam' (1960), starring Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, and Prithviraj Kapoor.

The scenery and settings are stunning in themselves.  It runs the range from battle scences, political intrigue, and family scheming to a romantic love story complete with music and dancing.  The love story centers on a very serious topic of Jodhaa taking a strong, uncompromising stand for her religious faith, despite pressure for a woman to conform and bringing peace to her region.  He must find the strength to keep his rule and establish peace among a conquered and diverse people.  Love and war, peace and diversity, all too current today.  I love a film that takes me to a different place and time.  I wish I understood Hindi, but am glad that is not dubbed.  I'm never bothered by subtitles.  And while musicals are not my favorite genre, the song & dance is minimal, most of it seeming to occur naturally in a festival setting.

3357903,5,B001450KCS,"I rented this movie form Netflix and fell in love with it the extent that I had to buy it. Historical accuracies aside, it is a great period drama with a wonderful message especially in todays tumultuous geopolitical environment in that love conquers all prejudices. The movie inspired me to learn more about the history of India and the history of the Moghul dynasty. From what I gather the daughter of Raja Bharmal, whatever her name,  was the third wife of the emperor. His first wife was the cousin of his father, and marriage provided protection for her and no child came from this union. His second wife was the wife of his general Bairam Khan and she was 12 years older than him. He later tried to have such marriages with the husband being so much younger than the wife outlawed. The Rajput princess was his third wife, she was 20 days older than the emperor and they were both 20 years old at the time of the marriage. Even though the union was a marriage of political alliance, the role of hormones at that age, even in the 16th century, would have played a role in the development of this relationship. Remember when you were 20 years old! The websites discussing the controversy regarding this movie position themselves according to the politics of the groups that host the site with the Hindu fundamentalists depicting Akbar as a despot and the Muslim sites trivializing the influence of Hindu wives of Akbar on his life and policy. But looking at the chronology, it is true that the emperor abolished the pilgrim tax on the Hindus 1 year after this wedding, and the Jizya tax another year after that. The family of the Hindu Rajput queen were incorporated into the court nobility so she could NOT have been too isolated from her own community. Akbar became a tolerant, pragmatic and liberal (in the modern sense that he focused on the service of religion for people rather than the other way around) leader of enormous economic effectiveness practicing a love of learning and nurturing a society founded on meritocracy. In the movie the monogamy understood in the love of Jodha and the inherent polygamy in the love of the emperor is subtle but apparent. In the love scene song she expresses their passion for each other and he expresses the special meaning she brings to his life (fragrance to flowers he already had in his garden). The movie is a terrific introduction to Mughal India and one that will encourage novices like myself to go to the web over and over and learn about the history of many cultures in general, and just for that, the $31, including the terrific deleted scenes that involve Mahesh Das who later became Birbal,  are well worth it and I thank the director Ashutosh Gowariker for it.",1281744000,3,2722,4.656964656964657

The cinematography, costumes, set design were outstanding.  The two religions, Islam and Hindu, were treated with sensitivity and respect.
Indian stars, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai, were totally believable as the great Muslim emperor and his unwilling Hindi bride.  Also, they are both beautiful to look at.  And what chemistry!  If you're a female, a couple of scenes will make you swoon...seriously.
Supporting roles were also well acted (except in a few instances when it might have been a little much).  Those are minor faults and easily overlooked.
Indians love their music and dancing and here, both were appropriate and integral to the story.  Quite lovely actually.

Any Hrithik movie without him dancing *a lot* already gets a stroke against it - he's such a good dancer it's almost a crime to not stuff his crazy dance moves into every frame - and there wasn't enough Hrithik dancing here. I realise this is a serious movie, as Akbar is almost deified by some, but I was still disappointed.

Hrithik also has a tendency to overact, although because this is a period piece it is almost appropriate that he does.

Aish does her thing with pouty competence. Her outfits are truly glorious; she looks every inch the queen.

It is 3.36 hours long, so you may have to take it in bites. It is primarily a ""based-on-truth"" historical romance and best watched irrelevant to historical accuracy. The director did say it was 70 percent fictionalized, but surrounds accurate historical events.

It is a love story between an allianced couple in the mid-1500's, he is Mogul (Muslim) and she is Hindu and his goal is to bring the lands together by the behest of her father. There are some excellent underlying themes that strongly appealed to me. Akbar's attempt to create peace through mercy (which reminded me a little of Ghandi), his determination that a land that welcomes all faiths will be respected and strong, and the honest purity and the patience he shows in his blossoming love for Jodhaa. In the end, it is very very romantic with much historical involvement and geography. It is spoken in Arabic and subtitled.

That being said, the cinematography ranges in everything from excellent to fair throughout. Some scenes are exquisite, yet some appear to take away from the movie as a whole. I think that there is something in this for men, if there is a date night. It's the length of the movie that would be daunting, but there is intrigue, deception, battles, and hand-to-hand combat that appealed to my husband. I varied in my reaction to the movie throughout, yet most of the things that did not appeal are probably of cultural difference.

I am very new to Bollywood movies and did not care for ""Bride and Prejudice"", and the honesty is that I thought I would be turning this movie off early......yet I was drawn in and found myself delightfully immersed and will wonder if anyone else will dream of yellow flower petals, the scent of cumin, and the music of India as I did. : )",1264032000,,1877,4.647590361445783

What I loved the most was the subtle romance between the two, there was no need for explicit scenes to get the message across to the viewer that the two were falling in love. The acting was superb. I could literally feel the emotion coming out of the screen.  I actually don't mind the subtitles, I think it would spoil the ""atmosphere' of the movie if it was dubbed.

I don't have a widescreen TV to skew the image and I didn't see the theatrical release of the movie to miss any songs, so for the average consumer like me I think it's a good buy.

3357930,5,B001450KCS,"The film has a epic proportion and provides the viewer with 3.20 hours of an delight experience.
  Does the viewer of today have the patience to watch a really lengthy film in today's times? But once into Jodhaa Akbar, the sequence of events, the drama, the romance, the war... every aspect keeps you mesmerized. Oh yes, the length does pinch you at one crucial point [second hour, which is relatively shorter], when a song breaks out. Otherwise, the 3 + hours are very well spent.

When you watch historicals like Mughal-E-Azam and Razia Sultan, the usage of chaste Urdu is difficult to comprehend at times. Not here! The language is simplified - Akbar speaks in Urdu, Jodhaa in Hindi - and it's easy to decipher.

As a cinematic experience, it would be wrong to compare Jodhaa Akbar to any of Ashutosh Gowariker's previous endeavors. Why, it would be erroneous to compare the film with any film ever made before in this genre. This one stands out and stands out the tallest.

Set in the sixteenth century, Jodhaa Akbar is a love story about a marriage of alliance that gave birth to true love between a great Mughal emperor, Akbar, and a Rajput princess, Jodhaa. Little did Akbar [Hrithik Roshan] know that when he married Jodhaa [Aishwarya Rai Bachchan], he would be embarking upon a new journey -- the journey of true love.

The daughter of King Bharmal of Amer [Kulbhushan Kharbanda], Jodhaa resented being reduced to a mere political pawn in this marriage of alliance, and Akbar's biggest challenge now did not merely lie in winning battles, but in winning the love of this defiant princess.

One of the prime reasons why Jodhaa Akbar works is because the present-day viewer is unaware of the romance between Akbar and Jodhaa. Sure, we all know of Akbar as a great emperor, but the love story makes for a refreshing subject. And the execution of a number of sequences makes Jodhaa Akbar extremely special.

Some instances:

  * The huge cast, with beautiful costumes.
  * The war sequence at the very outset. You realise the scale and magnitude of the film at the very beginning.
  * Hrithik taming an out-of-control elephant. It's hair-raising.
  * The use of a lot of well-painted elephants.
  * The sword fight the very next morning, between Hrithik and Ash.
  * The Azeem-o-Shaan Shahenshah track, when the entire kingdom hails Hrithik.
  * The fight in the climax [reminds you of the fight between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana in Troy].",1242777600,8,2442,4.761904761904762
3357931,5,B001450KCS,"There have been many comments about the lackluster quality of the DVD, and so my review shall focus on the movie itself [with the hope that all the flaws of the DVD shall be addressed in  future DVD releases of this amazing movie].

The film ""Jodhaa Akbar"" is an ambitious project even by Bollywood standards, for historical and period movies are quite hard to pull off and draw the masses. However, ""Jodhaa Akbar"" is one of the rare exceptions - even at more than 3 hrs in length, the story unfolds in such a manner as to draw in and engage the viewer's attention, with most of the movie focusing on the evolving relationship between Emperor Akbar and his consort Jodhaa Bai. The storyline is based on a little known story in history, that of Muslim Akbar's marriage and relationship with the Hindu-born Princess Jodhaa. The time period is sometime in the 16th century, where Emperor Akbar [Hrithik Roshan] marries a Hindu Rajput princess, Jodhaa [Aishwarya Rai]in order to cement an alliance between the Muslim Mughals and the Hindus. As the daughter of King Bharmal of Amer [Kulbushan Kharbanda], the strong-willed Jodhaa refuses to go meekly to her fate, and demands that Akbar agree to two wishes before agreeing to the marriage, one that she be allowed to keep her Hindu religion and not be forced to convert [in Islam, marriage between a Muslim and non-Muslim requires the non-Muslim to convert in order for the marriage to be considered legal], and second, that she be allowed to erect a shrine in her quarters dedicated to Lord Krishna. Akbar agrees, but is later frustrated when his attempts at intimacy are rebuffed by Jodhaa, who wishes for more time to get to know her new husband.

Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai credibly portray the royal couple who try to adapt to each other's customs and give and take, even though it is Jodhaa who is most put upon, considering she has to leave her family and friends behind for a strange new life in a Mughal palace, and where she is welcomed by new friends [Akbar's birth mother] and rebuffed by foes [Akbar's wet nurse and Minister in his goverment, a bitter old woman who is very antagonistic towards Jodhaa]. Akbar, as portrayed by Hrithik Roshan, comes across as a visionary leader before his time, who sets an admirable example by marriage, in order to bridge the chasm between the Muslims and Hindus in India. His style of governance is firm, yet incredibly tolerant, and he deals with his opponents in a fair and just manner.

Aishwarya Rai's Jodhaa is luminously beautiful [and honestly, I can't imagine any other contemporary Bollywood actress portraying this role]. She comes across as fiery and gentle, a contradiction of sorts, yet her facial expressions and mannerisms effectively portray the thawing in her feelings towards her powerful and equally determined spouse. What starts off as a purely political alliance and marriage of convenience slowly evolves into a true marriage based upon love, tolerance and compromise. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie [and there are many such dramatic scenes that pack an emotional punch] is the sword duel between a thinly-disguised Jodhaa and Akbar. Their chemistry is so palpable that one ceases to remember that these are two actors playing roles in a movie.

Besides the credible acting by the two leads, there are many other strengths in this movie, most notably the beautiful cinematography and the stirring music [unlike many Bollywood productions, the songs here do not interfere with the plot]. One of my favorite song sequences in this movie is the one that has the Sufi master singing praises, complemented by a Sufi dance performance. Akbar joins in, portraying his own spiritual release and this comes across so beautifully in showing the deeply spiritual aspect of Akbar's character.

The gorgeous costumes and jewelry are additional eye candy, as are the beautiful and authentic looking sets. All in all, ""Jodhaa Akbar"" delivers all that one could expect from a historical period drama - the casting is excellent, and the direction assured.

3357939,4,B001450KCS,"When I saw my first Bollywood film, it took a while to figure out what in the heck was going on. The film itself wasn't labeled a musical, and my previous exposure to films centered in or around India were limited to Gandhi and Monsoon Wedding...neither of which is shot in a true Bollywood style. After getting past my initial wtf, I've learned to enjoy these (mostly) cheerful excursions of song and dance, but I do admit that they have a habit of momentarily taking me out of the plot of the story. Sometimes it's just so vastly different from the emotional or physical pacing of the film, or the musical number begins to incorporate themes (fountains, springs, birds, etc...) that just materialize from seemingly nowhere. And yes, I now know that the Bollywood genre uses these images as a ""substitute"" or symbol of attraction, etc...but that doesn't change the fact that while I enjoy them, they can be distracting and break the film up a bit. That's just this Westerner's experience.

HOWEVER...I got very little of that in Jodhaa. The song routines fit each scene. The dancing was incorporated into the plot. And the songs themselves...OMG...hauntingly beautiful and in a style that fit the period of the piece. Needless to say, I bought the soundtrack too. The film isn't as far from Bollywood as Monsoon Wedding, but it uses the musical numbers as an enrichment tool without taking the audience out of the film. There's some lip synching, but usually in tender moments, not throughout the entire number, and with purpose: the song lyrics (thank goodness for subtitles) emote what the speaker is feeling without having him/her turn into ""the Indian version of MC Hammer."" ;) Btw, that last bit wasn't an insult to the genre but the use of one of my favorite quotes from Bride and Prejudice.

In fact, the only parts of sound that didn't like were what I called the Dramatic Chipmonk moments. Anyone who is a YouTube fan should know to what I refer. That overly dramatic musical score consisting of barely a few notes and coupled with a piercing glare...usually from Akbar. Oiy! The cheese was running a bit high for me in those moments, and it seemed like they did it ALL the time. LOL

Overall, I thought it was an excellent movie. The costumes, the love story, the humorous moments that reminded me of the wonderful, innocent love-play between two characters from films like It Happened One Night. And the chemistry between the two leads was just sizzling! What wonderful actors. Both have such a fantastic way of expressing with their looks and actions. I still smile whenever I think about the scene in which Akbar finds himself embarrassed to be staring at his wife or Jodhaa's look of fascination/lust tinged with embarrassment when she spies her husband working on his swordsmanship. Whew! That scene alone is worth the purchase price. ;-)

I really don't think this film fits perfectly into the Bollywood ideal. It branches out with a more subtle mix of what makes Bollywood so fun and glamorous but with more (dare I say) relevance to its musical numbers which i think could really make it appeal to a Western audience. While there may currently be more Indian fans than not, if this film is the example of the new face of Bollywood, I see it truly expanding to encompass a more global audience.

But while the quality of the film was superb, I had to subtract one star for the actual dvd format. It's most annoying feature is that you cannot access the main menu until the opening scenes/commercials for the dvd production companies are played. Easily got around by simply popping the disc in and doing an errand or so until it runs its course, but what's really aggrevating is that it's on all the disks...including the second part of the story. A really bad choice on their part. The portion after intermission should jump right to the next scene, otherwise it jars the audience out of the flow of the film.

The story is a beautiful romantic tale embedded in a period piece of the relationship between the Mughals and the Hindu Rajput dynasties.

Hrithik Roshan steals the show with his passion, intensity, and ability to take the viewer into a time where so much was going on in India... and extends credibility to his role as Akbar the Great and makes us love him.

I have seen this film THREE times in its entirety with my parents, aunts, cousins, etc - and have seen clips of it many times more.  Watch the DVD deleted scenes - it includes a really nice folksy tale of how Birbal the Wise joined the court of Akbar (a childhood tale re-enacted).

The song ""Inn Lamhon ke Daaman Mein"" is haunting and will cause goose bump.  Listen to it in its entirety and appreciate the Urdu-poetry and exquisite verses.  The video for ""Azeem-o-Shaan-Shahensah"" is a beautiful representation of the secular and beautiful diversity of the tribes of India.

It is basically a beautiful evolving love story that is very 'from the heart'. It is also about a great and good ruler who is wise, caring and had unusually high principles for his times..
It is sumptuous and shot in some stunning palaces and sets.
There are some battle scenes but they are short and symbolically violent rather than going on about realism as Hollywood seems to prefer (and I avoid thesedays). Some may not like the lack of realsim in that but frankly I got the point long ago about war and I don't need to see gut-wrenching images to drive that point further home. This isn't about war even though old power struggles and conspiracies are part of the times and woven in.
The ending is satisfying and the film reminds you about the higher points of being loving, wise and evolved as a human being.
The music is more subtle and traditional and Hithrik doesnt get to dance yet the music is also evocative and I tracked it down for its own merits even though I usually prefer the upbeat catchy Indian music. Hrithik is just so well cast here and does an incredibly good job. He won many awards for this portrayal and deserved them. Aishwarya Rey-Bachchan is also beautifully cast.
Even the English subtitles are credited with the name of the translator. Rightly so as the words are poetic and beautiful.

They showed some and enough to show the Emperor's good judgment as far as dealing with his subjects and especially those he had conquered. It was refreshing to see his religious tolerance and respect for his new wife.  The fact that he abided with her wishes concerning her faith made his views far before his time. I know there were inaccuracies as far as historically but it was not a documentary.

I was awestruck watching this movie.  The acting was outstanding on the level of Best Actor for Roshon. As a lay person I would not notice technical things but the overall scope of the film.

The acting is appalling, the staging pathetic and as for the battle scenes, with thousands of extras, they were laughable. When you can witness scenes such as are achieved in say "" Kingdom of Heaven"" and see this travesty. I wonder that the producers dare inflict it on an unsuspecting public without some warning on the box. The extent of the violence seems to consist of a lot of fake limbs being lopped off and quantities of red paint being sprayed around. I have never really understood ""Boolywood"" movies and if this is an example, I never will. Even the costumes looked as if they were made of plastic armour and the cannon were a joke. Singing and dancing do not make up for an abysmal movie. A total waste of money. Caveate Emptor!",1221523200,2,872,4.560509554140127
3357949,5,B001450KCS,"The file is outstanding. One of the best from Bollywood. Super Direction by Ashutosh, terrific acting by Aishwarya and Hrithik. Can be compared with Hollywood's Ten Commandments or Cleopatra. But this is the worst quality of DVD I have ever seen. The packing looks nice because of the colorful pictures and art work but the material used is cheap. I wish Ashutosh Govariker had chosen company like Yashraj Films to release the DVD. The Film is divided on 2 DVDs. When you load the 2nd DVD for the 2nd half of the film you have to go through UTV's stupid senseless startup routine! (Logo, menu etc.) This breaks the charm and continuity of the film. But its UTV. They will never care to check how such 2 DVD films are released in Hollywood!",1221091200,69,739,4.56390977443609

8254493,1,B001450KCS,"Disreputable vendor. I made a mistake of not reading the reviews.  This is an excellent movie--I saw it on Netflix or some streaming site--so decided to buy it as a gift.

Well, we did not even open the plastic seal until a year later and of course, the DVD Disk just stops, gets jammed up, etc.

Amazon should read some of the reviews about the vendor and cut ties with merchants that make Amazon look bad.

DO NOT TRUST THIS VENDOR OR AMAZON, AS BOTH SEEM TOO TOO WILLING TO MAKE A BUCK",1516665600,,488,4.21505376344086
