6260470,5,B00IE6SUGI,"Thought I wrote a review for this months ago lol guess not, but this is a must have in your DVD collection if you're a true Winx Club fan. P.S- Be sure to look out for the 3rd movie on DVD Mystery of The Abyss hopefully sometime this year since it has released on DVD in the UK and Australia a few days ago. Also season 7 is starting July 4th, 2015 (2 new episodes) in the UK, and this FALL in America I believe in November, so Winxers get ready to bring in the magic.",1409529600,,468,3.8854166666666665

The Trix are back again and team up with Darkar to beat the winx. Darkar kidnapped Bloom and makes her part of the dark side where she doesn't know her friends.

6260480,5,B00IE6SUGI,My family are big fans of the Winx club series I just wish it was easier to find seasons 3+ in volumes or other wise I prefer not to pay for the digital copies. On the plus side Amazon Prime allows you to watch all of them. The chronological order is: Winx Club seasons 1-3 (Note: season 3 is also Enchantix) or Winx Club Specials. Winx club: The Secret of the Lost Kingdom (1st movie). Winx Club Magical Adventure (2nd movie). Winx Club: Believix. Winx Club: Beyond Believix. Winx Club: The Mystery of the Abyss (3rd movie). Winx Club: Bloomix is the new season. They also have a spin off series called PopPixie it is about the pixies in pixie village (can be watched at any point after season 3).,1427068800,8,698,4.376923076923077
