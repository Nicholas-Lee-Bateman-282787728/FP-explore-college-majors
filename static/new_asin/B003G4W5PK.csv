4120972,5,B003G4W5PK,Good solid documentary on this event.  Could not find much more in terms of video than this one.,1408233600,,96,4.333333333333333
4120973,3,B003G4W5PK,"Generally, the movie is well-made with good use of newsreel footage of the tragedy.  I have a feeling though that Alan Canfora has made a cottage industry out of the 12.78 seconds that the shots rained down on unarmed students.  To an extent, the point could have been made that no matter what transpired in the city of Kent, or specifically Kent State University, that warranted capital punishment.  That being said, this is a chronicle in American history that was an epoch in how each viewpoint reacted and continue to react.",1406160000,3,528,4.78021978021978

4120975,5,B003G4W5PK,"Being a college student today, this movie had a profound effect on me. I was shocked that such a massacre could be carried out by those whose responsibly it is to protect us. It''s amazing how relevant this story remains 40 years later, especially as our country is entangled in questionable wars and increasingly curbing our rights.",1272585600,11,333,4.859649122807017
4120976,5,B003G4W5PK,"From watching Kent State: The Day the War Came Home, I have seen a full and concise history of the event, from what caused it (Nixon's announcement of going into Cambodia), to what caused the National Guard to intervene (the street riots and the burning of the ROTC building), to the shooting and the aftermath. What I had not realized before (as a 27 year old) that this documentary brought to my attention, was the parallel between the violence at Kent State that the National Guard was causing to that of the violence the army was engaging into in Vietnam, all going to show that the hostility of the Vietnam War was not just overseas but on our soil as well. All in all, this documentary is an eye opener and I definitely recommend it for people who want to know about the Kent State shooting as well as a sampling of the Vietnam War Era.",1272499200,16,842,4.403846153846154
4120977,5,B003G4W5PK,Definitely the document of record on the subject of Kent state. The film feels almost as if the main people involved in the shootings (including the shooters themselves) decided on their own to get together to privately discuss exactly what they saw happen and how they felt about it. It's a remarkable lesson on the reality of how quickly things can escalate when they don't have to and a film every National Guard member and police officer would be well advised to watch as a training film on how NOT to conduct crowd control.,1271289600,8,528,4.627659574468085
8396340,4,B003G4W5PK,"Two points of preface. First, my bias. I was an active Vietnam war protester in the UK at the time of the massacre and I was appalled when the news came through. A bizarre set of circumstances led to my becoming a professor at Kent State 35 years later and I have accumulated and devoured a large set of material on the incident. My pro-student bias at the time of the massacre has not changed. Second, this DVD is included free with the book ""13 Seconds - A Look Back At the Kent State Shootings"", so buying it as a standalone DVD is probably irrational.

The DVD does a splendid job in conveying quite how tragic the whole incident was. However, it falls short on its analysis. It conveys descriptions by a number of very articulate students right at the heart of the tragedy. These are offset by a smaller number of less articulate accounts by members of the National Guard. It is largely ""He says - She says"" although two firm conclusions are (i) the Ohio governor was unnecessarily inflammatory for his own political ends and (ii) the National Guard were appallingly directed.

Missing from the DVD, although present in other written material, is the extent to which the various establishment authorities (the state of Ohio, the National Guard and the bureaucracy of Kent State itself) covered up exposure of the blame. For example, ballistic analysis could determine which weapons fired the shots which killed or injured the individual students. However, no record was kept of which National Guardsman had which weapon on the day. This gets no mention in the DVD.",1526688000,,1569,4.743589743589744

8396343,4,B003G4W5PK,"Before you spend $25 + shipping you should know this a 47 minute film on DVD-R with absolutely no extras. That said,it is a very good documentary on a tragic day in US history. Content is 5 star, but $25 + shipping for a 47 min DVD-R is a ripoff.",1486598400,,246,3.94
8396344,4,B003G4W5PK,"Kent State - The Day the War Came Home, 2000 film

This 2000 documentary tells about the events of May 1970. On April 30, 1970 President Nixon announced the invasion of Cambodia. This led to protests across the nation. Students protested on Friday May 1 on the campus, then later out on Water Street in Kent (the bars were open). This led to thrown beer bottles that smashed store windows. The Mayor called Governor Rhodes for assistance. There were rumors of future attacks, the National Guard arrived. Saturday night the wooden ROTC building was set on fire. The firemen were attacked and left, the building burned down. The Guard then invaded the Kent State campus and dispersed the crowd. There was a curfew. The Guard was on campus Sunday May 3. Governor Rhodes spoke out against protesting students (he was behind in the race for US Senator).

A leaflet banned demonstrations but students protested. Curfew violators were arrested. They protested the occupation of the campus. On Monday May 4 classes resumed. Students gathered at noon on the Commons and chanted slogans. The Guard advanced to disperse the students. Tear gas grenades were thrown at the students, who retreated to the practice football field. Stones were thrown at the Guardsmen who threw them back. Some Guardsmen went into a huddle. Suddenly some of the Guardsmen turned, aimed their rifles and fired a volley. 67 shots in 13 seconds. Hundreds of students fell to the ground. Thirteen students were shot, four died. This was inexcusable and unnecessary. Later eight Guardsmen were indicted but not convicted. [Jury bias?]

There are books that provide more facts and photographs on this event. The Guardsmen were fed irregularly and were sleep-deprived, not a condition for wise decisions. Who gave the orders? The shootings led to protests at hundreds of other college campuses. Any declaration of martial law was illegal since the courts were operational. The Guardsmen invaded Kent State, they were not invited; they overstepped their authority. Earlier they were called to duty for a trucking strike but shot nobody. Was it that the truckers were armed and could have shot back unlike the students?",1481068800,,2177,5.0584958217270195
8396345,5,B003G4W5PK,When I was going to college this was hot stuff.  It still is for that matter and made me remember that cops will kill if provoked.  It don't take much to do that either and I do not mean to demean our guys in blue.  That is the way they are trained unfortunately!,1474761600,,263,3.9245283018867925
8396346,3,B003G4W5PK,"Tens of thousands of ""children of the Sixties"" have been calling for the open murder of ordinary Americans who object to their socialist/hedonistic agenda, now that they run the United States.  Whether it is abortion, the right to keep and bear arms, homosexual ""marriage"" or renegged land and grazing rights in the West, a standard retort from Social Justice Warriors is to wish us dead.

It is ironic beyond belief to watch their older selves indulge in an hour and a half of self-wallowing in this documentary, a mere two days after their older-selves, dancing in the blood of men like Lavoy Finicum in Malheur, Oregon.

Karma.  It's a law of nature no matter what you want to believe.",1453939200,,688,4.756302521008403
