8745205,5,B019HNJT5C,"We really enjoyed this DVD! We had previously watched Photographing Yellowstone, the Tetons & other Scenic Highways from the Adams & enjoyed their perspective so much that we watched this one as well. I think they really captured the beauty & atmosphere of Guatemala. I enjoyed seeing all the ruins & other historic places as well as the people & how they live. It is definitely worth the time to watch. I'll be showing it to my school age daughter so she can see what life is like in Guatemala.",1475971200,,495,4.511111111111111
8745206,5,B019HNJT5C,"I loved this dvd.  So many published dvds show only the most glamorous side of a country and
one never sees everyday life.  Lovely photos and video clips.  Makes me want to travel there myself the
country is so diverse.  Certainly would be worth the money.",1465084800,,256,4.5
8745207,5,B019HNJT5C,"This is a truly wonderful video.  Sharon Adams takes us places we could never go to on our own.  A terrific view of everyday life in Guatemala.  Very colorful.  The Mayan Ruins are amazing.  Tours of local museums provide a fascinating view of Guatemalan culture.  As usual, Sharon's photography is sharp and crystal clear, especially on the Blu-Ray disc.  You feel like you are right there in the middle of everything.  I also enjoy her narration.  While not a polished professional narrator, she brings her own charm and passion for the project that is especially enjoyable and adds a lot to the production.  It's a beautiful country beautifully photographed and produced in this video.  One of the things I like the most about Sharon Adams Studio productions is the serene, tranquil nature of them.  In an era of ultra-violence and mayhem on regular TV every night, Ms. Adam's productions bring a calming influence that I find quite helpful when I'm trying to relax from a hectic day.  I heartily recommend this video, and frankly, I think it's an incredible bargain at under $10.00 for the Blu-Ray disc.",1463011200,,1107,4.855614973262032
8745208,5,B019HNJT5C,"I really love this DVD.  Watching the video is like taking a trip to Guatemala and the Mayan Ruins without spending the time or money.  It is a wonderful DVD displaying the beauty of the country, the museums,  the culture and the history of the country.  I have watched this video numerous times. It is educational, interesting, and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone interested in visiting Guatemala or even just interested in the history of this country.  This was the second Blue Ray DVD I have purchased from Sharon Adams Studio and I have been very pleased with both.",1455062400,,582,4.7227722772277225
8745209,5,B019HNJT5C,"Photographing Guatemala has clear descriptions and captivating photos and videos. It includes maps, showing exactly where you are in Guatemala. It shows not only famous sites, such as Tikal, the colonial city of Antigua, and Lake Atitlan, but also scenes from the roadindigenous people, shops, farms, livestock and beautiful birds. Most of the DVD is accompanied by marimba music. There is not a dull moment. The guide will make you want to pack your bags and head to Guatemala.",1453334400,2,478,5.063291139240507
8745210,5,B019HNJT5C,This experience has changed me forever!  I never knew how gorgeous this place was and I will definitely travel to Guatemala now after seeing what is available.
