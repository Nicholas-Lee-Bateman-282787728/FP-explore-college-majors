8403867,4,B003RSI63K,"A 2009 Italian drama ""L'uomo che verr"" (""The Man Who Will Come"") centers on a eight-year-old girl Martina (Greta Zuccheri Montanari) and her family living in a quiet town of Marzabotto among the mountains during the WWII. Set in 1943-44, ""L'uomo che verr"" deals with the Marzabotto massacre that happened in 1944, and though director Giorgio Diritti avoids too direct descriptions of violence, the film is to most viewers hard to sit through because of the subject matter.

Most main events in the film are told from the viewpoint of Martina, who has stopped talking since her new-born brother died in her arms, and her young rebellious aunt Beniamina (Alba Rohrwacher). Martina's mother Lena (Maya Sansa) is pregnant again, but shadow of the war looms as the battles between the German Nazis and the partisans get fiercer.

Strong acting from the entire cast (including non-professionals) and beautifully shot photography is just part of the strength of the film, which tries to create the realistic portrayals of life during the war time. Directed by Giorgio Diritti (his second feature), the film is most effective when a little girl Martina has to witness the war and its atrocities. We are not sure she really understands what is going on, or even the difference between Nazi soldiers and partisans.

Though the film itself is compelling, watching ""L'uomo che verr"" is not an easy task. We know what will happen - even if you don't know the details of what happened in Marzabotto and its adjacent districts in 1944, you will sense something ominous in the slow and quiet first half, suggesting the devastating events that will soon follow.

The Marzabotto massacre is not the only atrocity committed against Italian civilians that has become the theme of a film. You may be interested in Spike Lee-directed ""Miracle at St. Anna,"" a WWII drama about the Afro-American soldiers and the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre.",1320451200,2,1920,5.009404388714733
8403868,5,B003RSI63K,"This is a wonderful, wonderful film, a true story about World War Two,and what happens to the people living in the mountains in Italy and their family members who join the Resistance against the Germans.  The sadness and wretchedness of the war is so well portrayed.  The story takes place in several villages in the mountains near Bologna Italy.  It  unfolds through the eyes of a mute 10 year old girl, who stopped speaking the day her baby brother died,several years earlier. The dialogue is in dialect but has subtitles. The acting is just superb!  The daily village life is so realistically  portrayed, exactly as the villagers lived it during those heart-wrenching times. The Italians have outdone themselves with this film.
  The two controversies in the film, evolve around the treatment and torture of the villagers at the hands of the German soldiers,as well as the unanswered questions and implications of the teachings of the Church. The inability of the Church at that time, to help the people leaves much bitterness and loss of faith on its parishoners, hence the title. It won't win an Oscar I don't think, because of the controversies, but it should. It was just marvelous. If you can understand the dialect,( and are Italian!) so much the better,( of course that is difficult) but the subtitles do an adequate job. This film is an absolute Must-See!",1308355200,4,1366,4.883116883116883
