7996212,5,B0000A5BVV,The tactics explained are very good and real world applicable.,1414368000,,62,5.3
7996213,3,B0000A5BVV,"The DVD shows Open Door entries, Hi man-Low man, Check drills etc. The first 30 minutes Mr Habermehl talks while they are showing videos of people training. It is interesting to listen to this talk since he explains a lot here. After that he is teaching a team and they practice some drills in a live fire shooting house.

The DVD is alright and I learned some things from it but bad sound quality, and like the other DVD Special Ops I would like to have a more in depth on ""how-to do"" explaination.

I give it a 3 star.",1175299200,,520,4.19
7996214,3,B0000A5BVV,"This film presents Chuck Habermehl instructing high risk entry tactics to a group of students. The instruction is not directed to the viewer, and he does not give hands-on instruction, anyway. Rather, this film is a presentation of a special operations instruction in CQB, Inc. The film constructs of interviews of Chuck Habermehl, and footage of entry drills, some of wich are live-fire.
The picture is sometimes muddled, and the sound level varies considerably, forcing you to constantly adjust the volume on your TV set. In addition, there is sometimes loud backround noise (because of the mechanized ventilation in the shoot house), making the sound even more blurred. Otherwise, the production and the overall quality are good.
Although this film is quite interesting to watch, it's hard to figure out to whom this film is intended for. An armed civilian, or even a regular street cop has little need for these tactics. They are for SWAT teams and the like, but those organizations don't have to rely on films like this for their training.
