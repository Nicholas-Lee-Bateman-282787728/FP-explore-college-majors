1396373,3,B000056B0F,"Definitely not the best quality or sound but since there is not a DVD of the original show, BB King and Friends, this will have to do. The duet between Etta James and Dr. John was and is probably the best track on the video or dvd.",1151539200,,231,3.9361702127659575
1396374,5,B000056B0F,"This is one of the greatest performances ever. Every blues fan from the casual listener to the bluesmaniac should have it on there shelf. It gives an in depth look at the roots of blues and some of the legendary artists that built blues into what it is today. B.B.'s performance was spectacular, and this version of ""The Thrill is Gone"" is one of the rare energetic, almost hypnotic renditions ever recorded, unfortuneatly the producer ommitted the song from the accompanying CD, but the live DVD performance is phenomenal. Don't leave home without it...",1094342400,,554,4.904255319148936
1396375,2,B000056B0F,"Next to Albert King, BB is my favorite blues singer/ guitist. The CD is awesome, so maybe I expected the DVD to be on the same level. Wrong! 65% of DVD is filler with comments from BB as well as other authorities such as Rufus Thomas and the smart white guy who teaches at some local Mississippi college.
Where is the concert? Although the DVD gives you the option of ""playing just the music"" , you just don't get much. The producers should have just recorded the show in its entirety and the DVD would have been close to a masterpiece!
Instead, they make it a documentary instead of a concert.
I was very disappointed!",1023926400,17,619,4.391304347826087
1396376,2,B000056B0F,"It really looks like a great concert is in the DVD. And the interviews are really interesting; I think they are maybe the best reason for why one would like to have this DVD. But two facts made me feel really disappointed.
First, the songs are not all in their complete performance. The beggining of most of them is overlapped with the interviews, some solos (which are the best expression of any blues performer's excellence) are cutted!!, and the final jam is chopped in three parts by the interviews, reducing the instrumental part to a minimum. Maybe is a really great jam but I just can't tell. This is unacceptable for any blues lover. So, if you really want to see what BB King is on a stage and admire him as a great blues performer, do not buy this DVD.
Second, the compression quality does not seem to be the best. Maybe this is a minor concern, but in some scenes the lossyness of MPEG compression can be really noticed. I am not an expert in video compression, but in other movies I have not seen such a thing. So, if you really want to feel that you are getting the best out of your DVD player, you should also consider not to buy this one.",1006992000,22,1153,4.317972350230415

7931649,3,B000056B0F,"Albert Collins (whom I had never seen before) was pretty buzzed on something. You could see B.B. was upset with Albert not communicating with anyone on stage, never following BB's direction. He seemed spooked. Sad. Otherwise it was a positive ""Old School"" jam session.",1375747200,,268,5.113636363636363

7931652,4,B000056B0F,"This DVD is well worth it as it contains several solid duets. Is it perfect? no way. Whomever decided to cut off the jam between BB and Robert Cray should be shot. Regardless, its one of the best BB King/Blues DVDs out there.",1192752000,,225,4.255813953488372
7931653,3,B000056B0F,"The only problem with this DVD is that it is designed as a concert DVD, with great names of all generations, while it is in fact a (not so brilliant) documentary on of the true legends of the blues and his recent activities.
In addition to that, this is supposed to be at least partly the documentary about the B. B. King's blues summit, and yet the authors haven't really interviewed other participants, some of which are blues legends themselves, with the additional younger star or two...

Portions of the concert seem quite spirited, although at times not rehersed enough, so this is far less a thrill to the blues fans than it should be... King's magnetic persona and remarkable music still shine through, but they don't shine strongly enough...",1166486400,,750,4.769230769230769
