6468336,5,B00L4LDFT2,"Let me ask the American public, is there anything better than getting stoned out of your mind and watching drugs Inc. Because you need to be under the influence of some type of narcotic to actually enjoy the show after you seen one episode. The basic premises is young African-American low level street dealers sitting around marginalize departments talking about how dangerous the drug game is. Usually they have their face covered with a bandanna or some other type of protective material as to not show their identity there is always a small amount of the particular type of the drug that the episode is about on the table, with a firearm or two just to make the white people back home say wow usually there's three or four or $500 on the table perhaps more in some episodes just to give the dealers some street credibility once in a while they show people stoned and that's always cool. If you are in the narcotics business you would have to be an absolute fool to go on a nationally aired television show especially when they've already designated what city you're in, and talk about your drug dealing business but that is why they make the drug game so easy to get arrested and because these young dealers are full of hubris and their egos have run amok and I can assure you that it won't be long before they're in the joint and that's a shame. When people with low self-esteem get into the narcotics business, it just makes life so easy for the police. But it's still fun to get high and laugh at these idiots and they are idiots when there's nothing else but reruns on remember what Johnny says do not get high on your own supply respectfully Johnny Irish",1410739200,,1663,4.491749174917492
