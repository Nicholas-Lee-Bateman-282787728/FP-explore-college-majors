8244251,3,B00126K3XA,"TNA Final Resolution was the first event of 2008 and the promotion was riding high off a hot feud between Sting and Kurt Angle and renewed relevance of guys like Kevin Nash, who began guiding new talent and shaping what is arguably TNA's best roster ever. TNA was gaining momentum at this time; however, their first event of 2098 was not a blow away event. Instead, they put on a solid though ultimately forgettable show.

Not Worth Watching: Kaz and Black Reign had a pretty lame affair, Judas Mesias and Abyss had a slow, dismal preview of the match they really wanted to have next month. These guys would enter barb wire massacre and make up for this turd. The opening tag match with LAX and Hoyt/ Rave was okay but far below what those two teams are capable of.

Worth Watching: Samoa Joe and Kevin Nash challenged for the Tag Team Titles in a solid match that was more about the storyline finish. The Ultimate X match was a scary, ridiculous car wreck that is worth seeing just to gawk at all the nasty blown spots; it's a miracle nobody was seriously hurt. The main event between Kurt Angle and Christian had a good mix of wrestling styles and storyline to make it a rewarding main event.

Match of the Night: TNA let their women's division show off and the match between Gail Kim and Awesome Kong was fantastic. This is a great example of a harrowing story put together with an excellent athletic contest.

There's a lot of good things to like but there would be numerous better, more memorable events in the near future. Check this out if you want to see TNA during its most prominent time period.",1407628800,,1605,4.486301369863014
8244252,4,B00126K3XA,"first of all,i got this for free at a live show for buying a t-shirt with 3 other dvds.but its definately worth your money any how.the matches are in the wrong order on the back of the dvd.i don't recall what order they were in so they will be out of order here too.but here they are.
  1-homicide and hernandez vs lance hoyt and jimmy rave[6 stars].this was a slaughter.it was a really good match with a flying border toss finisher!
  2-abyss vs judas masias.[6 stars]this would have been a million times better as a no dq match.
  3-kaz vs black reign[4 stars].this match kinda stunk.black reign is goldust and dustin rhodes in case you didn't know.doesnt ""kaz"" sound like ""taz""?and kaz's other name is ""kazarian.""doesnt that sound a lot like ""cecerean""?as in the alternative to a natural birth.this guy needs to get his own persona and a cool name then maybe he'll quit stinking matches.but with ol' goldust in the match,there was little hope it would be cool anyway.
  4-the motor city machine guns with jay lethal""black machismo""{black macho man"" vs the dudley boys with johnny devine.ultimate x match.[6 stars].this one could have been an all time great except only 2 of the guys could actualy go across the x.the dudleys were too heavy and the guns both had broken hands.also,johnny devine kinda sucks.
  5-booker t with his ol' lady vs robert roode and some ugly chick.[4 stars].BORING!the chicks were hardly in the match at all.both of the wrestlers performed like crap.the only memorable thing was when robert roode broke sharmell's jaw.now thats a really messed up thing to remember a match for!
  6-gail kim vs awesome kong[no dq for the women's title].[8 stars-classic].these two women stole the show as far as im concerened.this was one of the best female matches ever.let me name the others this match rivaled.
  3-when xpw showed thier chick topless
  2-the bras and panties match from wwe's invasion ppv starring stacey kiebler and
  1-the electric barbed wire match from strangle mania
  this match was extremely physical and gail kim held her own.gail kim used a lot of moves rob van dam employs.it made me wonder if he trained her or was her inspiration.rvd is my favorite wrestler so that was icing on the cake to see gail kim kicking butt like that.
  7-aj styles and tomko vs samoa joe and kevin nash.[tag team title match].5 stars.this one was pretty average.tomko sucks so i didn't expect anything from him.but,there wasn't very much high flying out of aj or total awesomeness out of joe.the only guy on his game was nash who left.this one couldve been a lot better.
  8-kurt angle vs christian[tna title match].6 stars.i don't like kurt angle or christian so i wasn't enthusiastic about this one.but they had a really good match.",1302566400,,2755,4.825159914712153
8244253,3,B00126K3XA,"It's not the best TNA dvd out there, it's not the worst. I think this PPV should be better. My main reason to buy this DVD is to witness Judas Messiah (Ricky Banderas) taking on Abbys.

The matches are okay. Most memorable, Kurt Angle vs Christian Cage which is an overall good and entertaining match. For the emotive part of it, Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong was also good. The DVD is entertaining, but isn't the best around of TNA but if you want to see TNA and just want an overall experience, this DVD should deliver ok.

The extras are almost gone: just a photo slide show and another Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong match on Impact! Besides that, there's nothing much left. Other DVD's have featured more cool extras. This one is somewhat lame.

3 stars out of five. The three stars mainly for the Angle vs Cage match which hands down is the best on this DVD.",1208217600,,853,4.31875
8244254,4,B00126K3XA,"TNA Wrestling Final Resolution January 6, 2008 Impact Zone Orlando, FL

TNA kicks off 2008 with a much better effort than they ended 2007 with. There were a couple of questions heading into this pay per view that needed to be answered, #1 Can Samoa Joe count on Kevin Nash as a tag team partner? and #2 Who will AJ Styles pledge allegiance to, Kurt Angle or Christian Cage?

Rock N Rave Infection W/ Christy Hemme Vs. LAX
This was a good solid opening tag team match. The mystery ""man"" associated with LAX who has been coming out to attack Christy Hemme is finally revealed as none other than the gorgeous Shelley Martinez. Rating 4/5

Black Reign Vs. Kaz
This was a pretty good match to me, Kaz is usually always entertaining as he did carry most of the match and this is one of the better Black Reign matches I have seen in TNA. Rating 3.5/5

No Disqualification Match For The TNA Knockout Championship
Awesome Kong Vs. Gail Kim (C)
This was a better match than their encounter last month at Turning Point. They even took the fight into the crowd and they had a very awesome ending to the match. This was a pretty good title match. Rating 4/5

Abyss Vs. Judas Mesias
This was just an average match, nothing more than something to further this storyline. There was a lot of silliness going on with James Mitchell distracting the ref and after the match Mesias poured gasoline on Abyss, and Mitchell was going to light a match and burn him alive then security came out and took his matches. Rating 3/5

Robert Roode & Ms. Brooks Vs. Booker T & Sharmell
This was an ok match for an intergender mixed tag match, even though it was mostly Roode vs. Booker. The women didn't even get into the match until close to the end but after the match Roode knocked Sharmell out and insured that the rivalry between him and Booker will live on. Rating 3.5/5

Ultimate X Match
Team 3D & Johnny Devine Vs. Motor City Machine Guns & Jay Lethal
This by far isn't the best Ultimate X match I have seen but it still is pretty good and it was definitely entertaining. It was fun watching Team 3D trying to get up there to retrieve the belt. They even brought a ladder into the ring and tried using it, the ending of the match assures that this rivalry isn't over yet. Rating 4/5

TNA Tag Team Championship
AJ Styles & Tomko (C) Vs. Samoa Joe & Kevin Nash
The issue going into this match was will Tomko and Styles be on the same page and can Joe and Nash trust each other as well? Despite their ""differences"" Styles and Tomko worked very well together as a team. Joe goes to tag in Nash and Big Sexy takes his hand away at the last minute and walks out on Joe quite possibly setting up another storyline. Rating 4/5

TNA World Championship
Christian Cage Vs. Kurt Angle (C)
At the start of the match the crowd is loving Christian, while Kurt Angle gets to hear a familiar chant from the crowd in ""you suck"", which he probably hasn't heard a crowd chant since his WWE days. This was easily the match of the night, it was a great title bout worthy of the main event slot. The ending sets up a rematch and possibly a brand new fued later on down the road. Rating 5/5

I was highly disappointed after watch Turning Point but Final Resolution made me forget all about it, TNA totally redeemed themselves with this event and it was a great way to kick off a new year. I totally recommend this dvd for any TNA wrestling fan, it is definitely worth the money.",1202860800,4,3429,4.34375
8244255,3,B00126K3XA,"LAX vs. Lance Hoyt & Jimmy Rave - This was a nice opener as it did it's job in getting the crowd hot.  The match itself for the most part was all LAX with Hoyt & Rave putting in their best TNA performance yet as a team and the crowd was all over everything they did.  The aftermath revealed that the ""guy"" who kept attacking Christy Hemme was the former Ariel from ECW in Shelly Martinez...who looked sexy as hell.

Kaz vs. Black Reign - Decent match here as Kaz was carrying the match for the most part & it was nothing out of the ordinary for Dustin ""Black Reign"" Rhodes.

Womens Champion Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - They topped their match from the previous month as again, they used the ""David vs. Goliath"" formula but delivered a different match.  Again, Kong dominated here & just kept overpowering Kim while Gail just kept fighting back.  Chairs were used, they brawled on the floor & through the crowd, & even the referee wasn't safe as he got a powerbomb by Kong.  Great match with a creative ending that was worth of the ""TNA"" chants from the crowd.
As a side note, Kong won the title at the following Impact in another great match from these two.  I hope they decide to put this on the DVD as an extra because it's worth it.

Abyss vs. Judias Mesias - For the first time in a long time, this wasn't the typical hardcore Abyss PPV match that was just a ""weaponsfest"" that went all over the place but it was still a slowpaced brawl.  They couldn't follow up the knockouts match & this was not much more than a setup for their Barbed Wire Masscre match for next month.

Booker T & Sharmell vs. Robert Roode & Ms. Brooks - Don't let the title fool you as this was a Booker T vs. Robert Roode match as the women didn't get tagged in until the the final moments.  This match was all about putting over the Brooks/Roode storyline as throughout the match, Roode kept forcing Brooks to do things that she didn't want to do like trip & slap Booker.  Sharmell got the win at the end but bigger story was the aftermath regarding Roode knocking out Sharmell.

Ultimate X Match: Jay Lethal & Motor City Machine Guns vs. Team 3D & Johnny Devine - This match is for posession of the X division title but yet, it's not a title match.  Eventhough you knew from the start that Team 3D wasn't going to be able to climb across & grab the belt (which led to some funny comedic moments thoughout the match), they evened out the odds by injuring the hands of the Machine Guns so they had problems climbing the ropes as well.  Eventhough this wasn't a ""spotfest"" as previous Ultimate X matches, some spots to look out for was Lethal's ""frankensteiner"" off the cables onto Devine, who was on Ray's shoulders, who landed right on his neck along with Devine tossed off the ladder & bounced off the tables (that didn't give) outside.  This match was entertaining but if your expecting a match the calibur of other great Ultimate X matches then you won't find it here.

Tag Team Champions AJ Styles & Tomko vs. Samoa Joe & Kevin Nash - This was a nice back & forth match between the two as Nash didn't drag the match down as you know to expect a good performance from the other three involved.  The big story here was Nash walking out on Joe during the match leaving Joe trying to fight off a 2 on 1 attack but lost.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Christian Cage - The crowd from the start was pro-Christian.  My favorite match of the night as you had two of TNA's best all around performers here delievered a back & forth match that never got dull for a moment.  The decision of A.J. Styles didn't play a part until the end but didn't overshadow or take away from a great encounter that went close to 20 mins. and was the best TNA PPV main event in months.

In the end, TNA rebounded from the ""disappointing"" Turning Point with a great main event with an undercard that progressed storylines, had some good wrestling, entertaining moments, and one match I would skip (Kaz/Reign).  I recommend.",1202256000,14,3973,4.35230352303523
