6295519,4,B00ITAQ4U8,"Eli Shane and his friends are taking it easy after defeating the vile Dr. Blakk who used modified slugs for his evil purposes.  The Shane Gang get reports of similar type slugs in the 99 caverns and they head out there to investigate.  Eli confronts and does a battle with a new kind of slug that invades the mind, can he defeat him or has he met his match? This action packed adventure lasts 44 minutes and there is a cute slugisode in the bonus features titled Burpy & Friends Take a Dive.

Fans of the Slugterra series will enjoy this DVD, but given how short it is, Im not sure its worth the $15 asking price.  If you do see it on sale, its worth picking up though.",1402012800,4,669,4.162790697674419
6295520,5,B00ITAQ4U8,"Honestly I am a closet Slugterra fan.  I put our first Slugterra DVD on for my boys last year and I actually watched it.  Usually I put animated shows on them while I am in the background but something about those silly cute little slugs drew me in.  I like the sore line behind the show and how they work together.  Its not really a violet show, except for the slugs they shoot!  This Slugterra DVD though is different as its the first ever Slugterra movie!  Its about a 40 minute movie featuring Shane and his friends.  Its an easy to follow plot and my boys have watched this DVD already more times than I can remember.",1401753600,4,622,4.264957264957265
6295521,4,B00ITAQ4U8,"SlugTerra: Ghoul From Beyond is an entertaining, action-packed animated film. This movie brings a new face to the slug. Instead of being creepy crawlers, they are warriors that can save the world. This makes the movie even more humorous to watch because these cute creatures are nothing like the slugs we find on earth.

Eli and the Shane Gang has defeated the evil Doctor Black from corrupting all of the slugs in SlugTerra but evil still runs rampant in the 99 caverns. For a short time Eli and the gang are able to stop the villains from doing any real damage, but nothing can prepare them for what they encounter: a Slug that can do something no one in SlugTerra has ever seen or heard. The gang must find a way to help win the battle against a great evil. Eli on the other hand must engage in a very different type of duel to save the slugs, his friends and himself.

This movie is perfect for the SlugTerra fan. There is more action and humor than ever before. I love how each slug has a unique power that helps them in combat. For example, Hoverbug has the power to fly, while Frost Crawler can protect itself by forming a sheet of ice around itself. Some slugs have safe powers like Boon Doc who can heal both humans and slugs. Other slugs can be harmful like Tazerling who zaps his opponents. My favorite character is a slug named Burpy because even though he is small he is a huge help in the battle.

Sam Vincent does a great job driving the story as his character Eli Shane. Lee Tockar adds amazing humor to the movie as his character, Pronto aka Pronto the Magnificent. The message of this movie of this movie is ""dont lose hope, always keep trying.""
There are many things that come to mind when I think of this movie. The eye-popping animation is one of them. When the slugs are launched into the air, it looks as if they are coming right at you!

SlugTerra is best for boys ages 8 to 11 and I give it four out of five dazzling stars. SlugTerra: Ghoul from Beyond is available online and comes to stores June 10th so to check it out.

6295568,4,B00ITAQ4U8,"I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but it gets 4 because I don't like the lead villain (avoiding spoilers). I'm not loving the direction the storyline is going either. I think some of the concepts expressed here detract from the unique nature of the show by re-introducing tired ""magical"" plot points and (in the followup movie to this one) ""elemental"" connections that were best left in the other shows that have done them to death already.",1418860800,,442,4.67948717948718

6295581,2,B00ITAQ4U8,"It was disappointing, I watched the entire series before watching this movie (just so I wouldn't be confused during this movie). It turns out that was a good idea, just not for the reasons I thought, since it spoils the season finale with cheap flash backs that take up nearly half the movie, the other half consisting of a blatant teaser for the next season. This is only made worse in that the villain was actually interesting.",1407628800,2,429,4.584415584415584
