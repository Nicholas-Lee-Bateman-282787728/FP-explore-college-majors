8138507,3,B000HCPWRM,"I wish that I was told they were region 2 dvd's before I bought them as they can not be played in any old dvd player in the US. But luckily my computer can play them so it's not that big of a deal, and the quality is really good. Still, it would have been nice to know.",1302998400,,269,3.6551724137931036
8138508,1,B000HCPWRM,"Well, this was a wasted purchase for me, as it was only when I popped it in to watch that I realized it was not rated for US...wrong zone, so I wasted 20 bucks plus shipping.....",1287792000,9,178,3.9722222222222223
8138509,1,B000HCPWRM,I bought this as a gift in the US.  We received this set from a US seller but the DVD set is for a zone 2 (EU).  I should have been informed this was not for a US DVD player.,1263081600,16,174,3.325
8138510,5,B000HCPWRM,I don't know about the US releases but I like this one. It's Region 4 so be sure your player can play it first. Maybe other people are too critical about quality in video but I think the Region 4 release has great quality. A little grain but that doesn't bother me. I think the sound is okay too. I enjoy it so get yourself a player that'll play it and get it. I'm gonna get the Season 1 Region 4 release too.,1255046400,2,409,3.9397590361445785
