6964812,3,B00S8ONMKA,"Disappointed Jan it is ok to start with the dysfunctional family of Henry 11 and his 4 sons and a treacherous wife but to totally skip King Edward 1, the hammer of the Scots and brought Wales to heal. A warrior General and Soldier. A difficult time to be a king vey dangerous. Then to skip Edward 111. Not a mention of King Richard 111 the last Plantagenet King. I was so looking for ward to this as no one not even the playwright Shakespeare ever covered Edward 1 & 111. 'This was a disappointment  for me.",1434240000,6,507,4.22680412371134
6964813,5,B00S8ONMKA,Very interesting and informative.  Makes me want to learn more about the Plantagenets.  Dan Jones is very passionate about the subject and holds the viewers interest.  We went through all four episodes in two evenings.  Wish there were more historical documentaries like this.,1432339200,,276,5.348837209302325
6964814,5,B00S8ONMKA,"A friend insists her boss is a direct descendant of the Plantagenets, and if she watches this documentary, she'll swear she's right. The tale of the Middle Ages' most vicious family line, as depicted in reenactments,  is a window on a time none of us would want to visit, even if we're fans of ""Game of Thrones"" (which pales in comparison to its real-life inspiration!) Beginning with Henry II, the story of this mighty dynasty unfolds over nearly 300 years. The four episodes feature lush locations---how could these people be so angry, living in those amazing castles? And if you didn't know before, you'll learn which Henry built Westminster Abbey--and the presentation of artfully preserved documents of the time. Historian Dan Jones, who has written extensively on the topic, narrates. Bios of the Plantagenet women are included in this set's extras. Spending time with the Plantagenets will give you new understanding and appreciation for those who rule with a gentler hand, and for those who endured the bloody reign of this famous family line.",1432166400,2,1051,5.040229885057471
6964815,3,B00S8ONMKA,"Because I am a big fan of Dan Jones books I purchased this series through Amazon. UK-  and while it was vaguely entertaining I would not recommend it for anyone who has read more than one book on the subject.  He skips some of England's greatest kings (most notably Edward the first and third) instead concentrates in the incompetent ones with a high scandal quotient (Edward II, Richard II).  Jones is a good narrator (and excellent eye-candy - especially for a historian) but I expected a much more complete documentary.",1431993600,14,522,4.777777777777778
6964816,4,B00S8ONMKA,"BRITAIN'S BLOODIEST DYNASTY THE PLANTAGENETS is another well-made British historical documentary that attempts to present the past with an over-emphasis on blood, sex, intrigue and cruelty. In other words all the elements that make up so many of the fictional historical programs currently being made today. Game of Thrones comes immediately to mind and indeed it is referenced on the cover of the DVD box.

As presented by Dan Jones, the author of the book this series is based on, every effort is made to present the material in a dramatically satisfying fashion while at the same time dumbing down the details to appeal to the broadest audience possible.

The trend with British educational programs today seems to be to make documentaries with a host, or presenter, which is one step closer than merely being a narrator. Acting as our tour guide, the host needs to have audience appeal if the show is going to work. The very best hosts show an enthusiasm for their subject along with an excitement as they share their findings with the viewer, sort of a ""and you'll never believe what happened next,"" quality. Unfortunately Jones comes across a bit too full of himself to be fully effective, with much of his narrative consisting of ""well I think,"" rather than just stating what happened, or what probably happened. Who cares what Dan Jones thinks?

What does work though is the beautiful location filming. I never get tired of looking at castles and when they are used to excellent effect in re-enactments of key events (as they are here) they compensate for the mediocre narrative. Some of the dramatized bits are clearly chosen for sensational reasons, such as the cutting off of one poor fellow's genitals (men viewing this are sure to squirm at this point). Despite these arguably unnecessary graphic moments, THE PLANTAGENETS provides enough new information about its subjects that anyone interested in Britain's monarchical history is bound to enjoy the program.

Of particular interest was learning what a rotter Richard II apparently was.  I had no idea.  If Shakespeare had done to him what he did to Richard III we would have a very different understanding of him today.

As always, the Athena series of documentaries will appeal to a specialized audience. The series is well made, even if it tries a little too hard to be ""cool"".",1431216000,26,2345,4.921518987341772
6964817,5,B00S8ONMKA,"The narrator states Plantagenet is ""the angriest family in history."" Personally I love books and movies depicting the Middle Ages period of history, so a documentary about the reality of it all was right up my alley. This is about the 300 years of the greatest of English dynasties. The Dark Ages are presented via reenactments, expert narration, film of present day sites, archival documents some 900 years old, and even humor bits from narrator, Dan Jones.  He makes the education fun and entertaining.
Very interesting seeing the actual partially preserved sites of events and how they appear today.

6964818,4,B00S8ONMKA,"DYNAMIC NARRATION AND LAVISHLY DRAMATIZED SCENES --- SKIPS SEVERAL REIGNS TO HIGHLIGHT KEY POLITICAL CHANGES AND FIT A SHORTER RUN TIME  --- VERY COLLOQUIAL NARRATION STYLE RATHER THAN TRADITIONAL --- (SDH SUBTITLES)

Presented by Dan Jones, acclaimed historian and author of a book on the same topic, this documentary covers the first nearly 250 years of the Plantagenet rulers.  This encompasses the period of the main branch (direct father to son successions)  until that ended with Richard II, at which point other branches of the Plantagenets came into play.  In just four 1 hr episodes, it's not possible to cover anything deeply.  Each episode is detailed but brief relative to the subject.  The program also skips nearly every other sovereign.  However, I noticed there seems to be a method to their coverage.  The title mentions ""bloodiest dynasty"" and blood is definitely a theme.  Nevertheless, there are critical political-governance changes during the sovereigns that are covered such as the Magna Carta, Provisions of Oxford etc...  These are the focal points that seem to act as a theme.  Behind Dan Jones' dynamic narration we see mostly lavish dramatizations with brief battle scenes and beautiful costumed court intrigues.  There are also visits to famous castles and battlefields important to the story.  I wouldn't have minded 4 more episodes to cover spaces left by this program in the main branch.  That would have been great!

HERE IS AN OVERVIEW OF CONTENT BY EPISODE:

EPISODE 1. HENRY II -- founding of the dynasty and the power struggles with his sons (Henry, Richard I and John I).  Thomas Becket, Hugh Mortimer

  ----- (skips the reign of brothers Richard I and John I though they were mentioned as sons and rivals in previous episode)

EPISODE 2. HENRY III --  Look back mention of the Magna Carta which was established during John I.  Westminster Abbey, Simon de Montfort as friend and eventually foe to Henry, Provisions of Oxford and precursor to Parliament.

  ----- (skips Edward I)

EPISODE 3. EDWARD II --  Piers Gaveston his close confidant, Isabella ""The She Wolf"" Edwards wife, Roger Mortimer, the Despenser support from Wales, Thomas of Lancaster from junior branch of Planagenet leads Baronial opposition, The Ordinances of 1311 (41 articles)

  ----- (skips Edward III {and Edward the Black Prince})

EPISODE 4. RICHARD II -- Last of the unbroken main line of Plantagenets before junior branches begin to ascend the throne.  Peasant's Revolt when he is just 14.  Golden Boy's transition to absolute tyrant.  Gloucester and the Lords Appellant.  Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) resistance and the ascension of the junior branch of Lancaster Plantagenets.  Henry's rule is not covered, just his battles with Richard and the change that allows other nobles to claim the throne that are not main branch Plantagenets.

There is no coverage of non main branch sovereigns down to Richard III, House of York & the last of the Plantagenet dynasty.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  There was some complaint among the British public that Jones' style was too colloquial.  He is a young guy and he uses phrases like ""going viral"" and ""propaganda dynamite"".  No doubt he is appealing to a younger crowd to get them involved.  I didn't think his few colloquialisms were that distracting and I appreciated his constant energy.  I didn't mind Dan Jones less formal way of speech and I suspect it's part of his real personality.  His dynamic narration and energy are strengths of the program.  There are also a few trips to various archives to view historical documents relating to events.  Though Jones is speaking English all the way through, you do hear some conversation from the dramatization in the background.  The actual dramatization is mostly in French since that is the language spoken by nobles at the time.  It is a good reminder that these are Norman rulers and adds authenticity to the program.  For viewers not using the SDH subtitles for the whole program, there are just a few English subtitles where you can hear the French.  The documentary is not perfect, as few are, but it was fantastic in my opinion.  Really serious historians who already know this topic may find it an entertaining overview, but not more.  For those who are not that familiar, it's an exceptional introduction.  The title mentions blood, so of course there are some digital effects during battle scenes and executions that send blood flying.  There is also one scene of sexual situation that doesn't quite show things.  Overall I highly recommend the program.",1427500800,70,4561,5.038873994638069

6964823,3,B00S8ONMKA,"What is here is good, my problem with it, is that Mr. Jones opening premise is that the Plantagenets were the dynasty that turned England into a nation. However, he then goes on to detail only the worst and weakest ones. He completely fails to mention Richard the ""Lionheart""-O.K. not the greatest but famous enough to warrent a mention. And no mention of John, who was forced to sign Magna Carta! I believe this program was produced to try to cash in on the whole Game of Thrones hoopla. As I said before, what is there is good, but this could have been soooo much better! I was somewhat disappointed. I ordered it for my husband who has Plantagenet blood. We were not surprised that they were not all sterling characters, but disappointed the story is so incomplete!",1490400000,3,768,4.572463768115942

6964828,1,B00S8ONMKA,"This didn't cover all the Plantagenets kings, just the most notoriously bad rulers--not even Edward I was covered! If you like to watch a pretty boy narrator walk around ruins and talk about how terrible decisions were made by defective personalities, or watch a few well-dressed up actors (speaking French that you can barely catch under the narrator when it isn't subtitled) play out a few scenes, replayed ad nauseum, buy it. Otherwise, the history angle is scanty and very incomplete. Very disappointed.",1485216000,13,507,5.120481927710843
6964829,5,B00S8ONMKA,"Its hard to imagine anybody that was not exposed to the Plantagenets through reading history or fiction such as the Cadfael series.

However there is more depth and Intrigue to the true story of the people in times of this era that you usually get in a general introduction.

What makes this presentation essential is that it is the individual viewpoints of the historian that makes history part of our lives. It is important to get different viewpoints instead of just a homogenized introduction. In this presentation we get the viewpoint of Dan Jones who studied under David Starkey at Cambridge.

Because it focuses on the violence of Plantagenets themselves this presentation can be a little gory at times but also shows the brutality that mightve been missed in other presentations.

Before and after watching this entertaining in-depth program with exclusive extras, be sure to read the 12 page viewers guide with a map of the Plantagenets realm; timeline; and articles on the time before and after the Plantagenets.

For the people who already know of the times and people involved, one may be a little disappointed at first as it appears that Dan Jones skips over vital information; but take heart the information comes out at a later time and also from interviews. So what you think is missing at first is just placed a little different in the timeline.

6964856,4,B00S8ONMKA,"While I think the line ""This is the REAL game of Thrones"" is a bit of hyperbole, this story and the telling of it IS fascinating. The telling is done in modern colloquial style so your average pop audience can relate. It feels like it is targeted to the History Channel crowd. It's not a dry documentary at all.

I was particularly interested in this because I am descended from King John. I knew bits and pieces about all of the Plantagenets, but this put the pieces together for me to create a comprehensive whole.

It's hard to imagine brother killing brother, father, mother, or son! These people were really suspicious, power hungry, and just downright mean. Power corrupts.

My complaint is that it skips over a LOT. Of course, you can't include everything in a documentary that spans 300 years, but there were people I wanted to know more about. I suppose they felt that either they were minor players or they are adequately covered elsewhere. Still with a title ""Britain's Bloodiest Dynasty"" I had hoped they get more than a passing glance. No Richard the Lionheart? No John of Magna Carta ""fame""? And while Eleanor of Aquitaine is included, she and all women gets short shrift. She is probably the greatest Plantagenat. She should have a show just on her!

The included booklet ads to the film. That is a handy bonus. The snippets on the wives is also nice, but I wish it were more than a passing footnote.

The DVD stops before the war of the Roses. Isn't Richard III the last Plantagenet? Oh, well. I really enjoyed the whole thing. It left me thirsty for more!",1450742400,,1572,4.580071174377224

I'm a fan of Dan Jones and this series is a favorite. I wish he would cover all the monarchs in order but in this series he mostly covers the disasters which skips a few monarchs here and there. His books are considerably more in depth and I've read a few of his. This is about blood and there's no shortage of that in Britains history. He talks from locations with reenactments thrown in, I cannot speak for the accuracy of the costumes but I'm not watching this for that, I'm intrigued by the history, the stories, and his insightful narration.

6964866,5,B00S8ONMKA,"This series bears all of the hallmarks of the typically well-done British Docu-Drama. The acting is superb, the actors ease effortlessly into their roles as various members of the ancient Bristish ruling family - the Plantagenets. This family was unrivaled in ferocity, cunning, greed and mendacity, even in a time when many of those traits were the norm for those attempting to wrest power for themselves and their families.

The Plantagenets originally held title to large swathes of France, in addition to England. This family was willing to do anything to gain and maintain power,  wives forming alliances with sons to betray their husband and father, fathers choosing willy-nelly from various sons to determine inheritance of the throne. Brothers betraying brothers, wives betraying one and all.....this is riveting history presented in an exciting, yet historically accurate manner.

The one Plantagenet that seems to be the most well- known, Richard III was not mentioned in this series. I would imagine that the constraints of time and finance played a large role in the elimination of that fascinating historical figure from this series.

6964878,1,B00S8ONMKA,"This series is a complete disaster!  It is really pointless.  It aims for historical accuracy by having the actors speak French but dresses them in ludricrous armor.  In the period depicted (1100s-end of 1300s) they never change from their chain mail dress.  I don't think that mail was ever worn the way it is shown in the series.  It only covers the upper part of the body, leaving the lower torso unprotected.  The change in armor from chain mail to the increasing use of plate armor with the passage of the centuries is never shown.  This is completely at variance with real history and indicates gross sloppiness on the part of the persons producing this supposed documentary.  .

The kings depicted are incompetent and engage in so many misdeeds.  What's the point of this series?.  The only take-away message is tha the rule of this dynasty led to the increasing strength of the English Parliament at the expense of royal power.

6964885,5,B00S8ONMKA,"For 300 years the Plantagenets murdered, betrayed, and tyrannized an England just emerging from the chaos and violence of the Middle Ages.  This dynasty also produced some of England's most legendary (and often notorious men) from the famous Crusader king Richard the Lionheart to the ruthless Edward the Longshanks, Hammer of the Scots, of Braveheart fame to  Henry V whose ""band of brothers"" extracted a bloody victory at Agincourt.  But it is not these men whose lives are examined in this documentary serie.  It shines its light instead on lesser known members of the clan who, despite military blunders and family treachery brought the British Empire such lasting achievements as a representative parliament and English Common Law.

The series begins, where else, but at the beginning with the reign of the first Plantagenet, Henry II.  Henry II became an heir to the English throne when his father Geoffrey V, the (French) Count of Anjou  and later Duke of Normandy, married the Empress Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of King Henry I of England.

At the tender age of 18, young Henry marries the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine whose marriage to Louis VII of France had been recently annulled.  Together the couple produced a brood of eight children, including five very ambitious princelings.  Encouraged by first King Louis VII then King Philip II of France who had suffered the loss of Brittany and much of central France south to Toulouse due to Henry's imperial expansion, ""Young Henry"", Richard (later to become the Lionheart) and Geoffrey, dissatisfied that their father had not shared his power when they came of age, rebelled against him in 1173 with the support of their mother Eleanor. (the basis for the 1968 Oscar winning film ""The Lion in Winter"" starring Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn)

This documentary appears to attribute much of this strife to Henry II's unwillingness to yield any of his tight-fisted control of his expanding empire to his sons.  I always thought sons were supposed to wait until their father dies before taking their turn at the helm, but apparently not the Plantagenets.

I have a dear friend who is absolutely in awe of Eleanor of Aquitaine. But I can't help but think Eleanor has bathed, at least to some degree, in the reflected glory from the legends of her son Richard the Lionheart.  As this documentary reveals her role in the intrigues surrounding her husband's reign it appears to me she is someone who, having the taste of queenship at a young age, harbors a healthy appetite for power herself.

Like a witch from Macbeth, Eleanor keeps stirring the cauldron, resulting in a second revolt in 1183 in which ""Young Henry"", the heir apparent, is killed.  Richard, now next in line for the throne, begins to fear his father will make Richard's younger brother (and his father's favorite) John, king, so Richard rebels a third time in 1189, aided by the French King Philip II.  Henry II is finally defeated and, suffering from a bleeding ulcer, retreats to Chinon in Anjou where he dies.

This tale of betrayal and complex political machinations is told with professionally acted cinematic clips and voice overs by award-winning journalist and historian Dan Jones.  Mr Jones appears periodically throughout the program in research libraries or on the grounds of castles or cathedrals. For the most part, talking heads are pretty much avoided, a most welcome approach that makes the viewer feel more immersed in the events.

I found the next episode riveting as well.  The reigns of Richard the Lionheart and his brother King John (of Robin Hood fame) are skipped over and the narrative picks up during the reign of Henry III, King John's son.  We discover this Henry, unlike his grandfather, is totally inept on the battlefield, despite dreams of recovering the family lands in France lost by his father.  Furthermore, the king is now limited in his authority to levy taxes on his barons by the Magna Carta, signed by his father, so when his barons lose confidence in him, he must redirect his energies to something less expensive than making war and turns to building Westminster Abbey.

But he chafes under the Magna Carta's restrictions on his kingship and turns to an experienced warrior from France, Simon de Montfort, to pursue Henry's dreams of conquest in 1230.  The documentary mentions that de Montfort had spent his youth ""chasing heretics"" in France.  Having visited southern France just two years ago, I was aware of the slaughter that occurred in the Albigensian Crusade (to persecute the religious sect now referred to as Cathars) and it was certainly not an activity to be taken quite that lightly.

At first I thought this Simon de Montfort was the religious zealot I had encountered in the histories of a number of sites in Languedoc that I had visited.  I spent a beautiful day wandering the streets of the little village of Minerve, the site where Crusaders led by de Montfort burned 140 men, women and children at the stake for heresy.  Of course this atrocity did not hold a candle to the massacre of 20,000 inhabitants of Bziers, another picturesque city  overlooking the river Orb in the Languedoc region that I had the opportunity to visit. I even stood on the grounds of the Cathedral of St. Nazaire where many townsfolk had taken refuge and were subsequently killed when the cathedral was set ablaze and the roof caved in on them.

Although the overall commander of Crusader forces at Bziers was officially the papal legate, Arnaud-Amaury, Abbot of Cteaux, de Montfort was named his chosen successor shortly thereafter.

My research revealed Henry III's de Montfort, though, was just a youth at the time. But he apparently accompanied his father on these grisly expeditions and evidently learned a lot from him.

Henry finds Simon charismatic and much more militarily decisive than the king.  By 1236, Simon is so confident in his position at court that he refers to himself as the Sixth Earl of Leicester, although the king has not officially granted him that title.  (His father had earned the title of Fifth Earl of Leicester but it was not a hereditary title.) Simon's ambitions continue to soar when the king allows Simon to marry Henry's sister, Eleanor.  But there's a fly in the ointment.  Henry, perpetually short of funds, does not give Simon the lands he should have received as part of Eleanor's dowry.  Then Simon takes out a big loan naming Henry III as a guarantor without the king's knowledge.  This arrogant miscalculation on Simon's part infuriates Henry who threatens to imprison both de Montfort and the king's own sister in the Tower.  Being fully aware that Henry is deadly serious, de Montfort and Eleanor flee to France.

Henry eventually recalls de Montfort and asks him to campaign against King Louis IX of France in Poitou, another of Henry's disastrous attempts at recovering lands in France.  But during the battle Henry flees the field and leaves de Montfort fighting a desperate rear guard action.  When De Montfort finally escapes, he confronts Henry, telling Henry he should be locked up like the ineffectual Carolingian king Charles the Simple of Paris (a cowardly character in the History Channel series ""Vikings"".)

Although Henry is furious, he recognizes de Montfort's considerable administrative talents and seeks to appease him by appointing him viceroy of the troublesome Duchy of Gascony.  Simon, true to his inflexible Crusader upbringing, comes down hard on the barons of Gascony, even cutting down their vineyards - an appalling atrocity to the French.

Meanwhile, Henry has turned over administration in England to the Lusignans, petty French warlords who had gained a reputation for their ruthlessness in the Holy Lands.  The Lusignans immediately begin grabbing land and property, including the sack of the London palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Back in France, the Gascons raised so much of a ruckus about de Montfort that Henry places de Montfort, who is now a titled baron recognized as the Sixth Earl of Leicester, on trial, apparently thinking he will finally rid himself of this troublesome fanatic who even wears a hairshirt under his clothes day and night.  But the other English barons come to de Montfort's defense and will not convict him.  Evidently, the barons are fed up with Henry's Lusignans and need the military skills of de Montfort to lead a rebellion against the Lusignans.

Henry responds to the crisis illogically by deciding to accept the Pope's commission to invade Sicily, another foolish dream of military conquest that he cannot afford.  To finance the fiasco, Henry defies the Magna Carta and levies a substantial tax on his barons.  The barons, led by de Montfort, descend on London dressed in full battle armor and demand that the king not only give up his dreams of glory in Sicily but that he agrees to remove the Lusignans and introduce a council of 15 barons that will meet three times a year to conduct the realm's business.  Henry has no choice but to agree to the ""Provisions of Oxford"", a document on which England's current parliament is based.

But Henry is not a man of his word and within four years' time tries to bring back the Lusignans.  De Montfort raises an army and defeats Henry in the resulting civil war at the Battle of Lewes, despite the encumbrance of a broken leg.  With Henry as prisoner, de Montfort essentially runs the country for the next ten years until Henry's son Edward (the Longshanks) raises a Plantagenet army and confronts de Montfort's forces at the village of Evesham.  There, Prince Edward commissions a 12-knight hit squad to find and slaughter de Montfort on the field of battle - reflecting the ruthlessness he would later employ against the Scots.

Plantagent rule is reestablished and the dynasty and documentary series, continues, skipping the reign of Edward the Longshanks, then examining the reign of his son, Edward II. The last episode focuses on the reign of Richard II, the son of the famous (or infamous depending on your point of view) Edward, The Black Prince.  Richard II is considered by some the last of the main Plantagenet line before it split between the House of York and the House of Lancaster.

The Daily Mail compared this series to a real-life version of Game of Thrones and, although we have no dragons or stone men, I would be inclined to agree.  The sheer ruthlessness demonstrated by those who held the throne or lusted after it during this period makes for a riveting series.
