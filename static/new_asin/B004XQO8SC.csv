4497661,5,B004XQO8SC,"As a fan of Mary Ann Mobley, I have really enjoyed this movie.  You can certainly understand why she was one of the most loved and talented Miss Americas of all time!",1401494400,,166,4.1875
4497662,5,B004XQO8SC,"Get Yourself A College Girl was released in 1964. Nancy Sinatra, Mary Ann Mobley, and Chris Noel starred. Squarely aimed at teens. Lots of songs. The Dave Clark 5 and The Animals provide great  support.",1364169600,,202,4.771428571428571
4497663,4,B004XQO8SC,"I bought ""Get Yourself a College Girl"" to add to my Chad Everett collection, and this 1964 musical comedy is a typical example of the cheesy movies made in this era. Yes, it is dated now, but it still gives one a good feeling with an exaggerated example of a fun filled college life vacation. The DVD is remastered  and is very good quality in both sound and picture. The actors I believe did a reasonable job with their one dimensional characters, and the plot.... well what plot? This movie tho', has great music and I found myself 'getting in the groove', so to speak ! Its a movie with humor, colour and Chad Everett. In my opinion, who could ask for more. Worth watching.",1351555200,2,676,4.408
4497664,5,B004XQO8SC,"This is an addition to my Chad Everett collection. It is very fun to see all these stars so young, as well as the musical acts. I believe that all of the female leads were also co-stars with Elvis Presley at some point. The quality and sound were very good. It was enjoyable to escape into this film for simple entertainment and the pleasure of seeing so many pretty faces from the past.",1350345600,,387,4.315068493150685
4497665,4,B004XQO8SC,"If you like the music from the early 1960's, you will like this film if you let yourself go and just enjoy it - The Dave Clark Five perform two songs and so does the group The Animals - - - There are quite a lot of songs and all upbeat - this does not have the expected 'dated' feeling and there is also a light-hearted Love story. I like Chad Everett in anything - so I liked this positive feeling film.",1347840000,,404,3.9390243902439024
4497666,5,B004XQO8SC,"Well-acted story of mid-60's genre; the music played in this movie makes it worth the buy alone.  Practically an all-star cast; also the movie keeps the person watching it entertained throughout, so there's not a dull moment in it",1336176000,5,230,4.897435897435898
4497667,4,B004XQO8SC,"Producer Sam Katzman sure has his finger on the pulse of America's youth.  In previous efforts he defended their right to rock and twist despite the protestations of their disapproving elders.  With this film he is championing feminism long before Gloria Steinem burned her bra.  No, these ladies are not looking for enacting laws for equal pay for equal work.  They want to Watusi!  And who better a standard bearer for women's lib than former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley.  All kidding aside as camp this is pretty good.  Mobley's rendition of the film's title tune is a hoot.  The youthful cast is energetic led by Chris Noel, Nancy Sinatra, and Chad Everett best known as that dreamboat Dr. Joe Gannon on ""Medical Center"".  The featured acts(The Animals, The Dave Clark Five, The Standells among others) lip synch their songs admirably.  Eric Burdon seemed a little stiff on ""Blue Feeling"".  He recovers nicely for the film's closing number, ""Around and Around"".",1332460800,6,966,4.937888198757764
4497668,4,B004XQO8SC,"Everyone seems to remember this movie for a different reason: Some may like it for Chris Noel (some even thinking they'd seen a new Marilyn...??), others for Mary Ann Mobley or just the pure clean fun of it...

4497669,4,B004XQO8SC,"Somehow, I missed this film during it's original theatrical run back in the 60's. I had in fact almost forgotten about it entirely until, first-I read about it back in the mid 80's in that fabulous book The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, and second-when I saw the faded and scratchy trailer on a Something Weird trailer compilation tape. Once I saw that trailer the movie quickly became one of my most wanted dvds. Well, my wish finally came true! And not only that, but Warner Archives' print looks pristine and virtually flawless-even the included trailer looks (somewhat) cleaned up! The acting in the movie is par for the course for this type of film-namely sophmoric-but what else would you expect from a 60's movie with a title like this? The(many) songs are indeed dated, but in a hilarious, almosy catchy sort of way. And the inclusion of the original version of 'The Girl From Impanema' was a totally unexpected but welcome treat. I think Mary Ann Mobley was one of the most adorable actresses of the 60's (I especially liked her in 'Girl Happy') and Chris Noel was great eye candy in every film she ever appeared in. For me. this is nostalgia heaven, and aptly reminds me of how much fun 'sex comedies' used to be back in the day without having to resort to showing bare(fake)boobs and butts or spewing profanity to get cheap laughs like movies do today. All in all, I'm glad I finally got this college girl!",1307491200,25,1422,4.646825396825397

8447412,5,B004XQO8SC,"Early - Mid Sixties Beach Party Type of Movie - Except on land at a ski resort. Saw it when I was a kid probably 15. Not much of a plot, and probably a geeky type of movie, but a fun one as a kid. Astrud Gilberto Sings her hit song, Girl from Ipanema, w/ Stan Getz / her manager or Partner (music) on Sax. Animals sang, w/ Dave Clark 5 & others.",1436745600,,345,3.73972602739726

8447415,4,B004XQO8SC,"60s music and a sappy plot.  But the reason to buy this movie is an unknown band called the Rhythm Masters.  They do one great instrumental song and were as well choreographed as Britney Spears ever was.  But be prepared -- not only guitars and drums, but also things like banjo, clarinet, trumpet and more. It actually made me look for an album by them, to no avail.  Maybe they were created for this movie.  Their 2 minutes is really fun.",1421193600,,440,4.382716049382716
