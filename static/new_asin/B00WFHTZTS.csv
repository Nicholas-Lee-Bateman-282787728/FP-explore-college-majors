7131536,4,B00WFHTZTS,"Great camera work really sets this one apart, and complements the interesting story and good acting.  Check it out!",1451865600,2,115,5.052631578947368
7131537,1,B00WFHTZTS,"Hilariously bad acting that goes full-awful during the finale.

For the most part, it's pretty much just 90 minutes of an old pervert wanting to watch girls get nude while he also watches a girl bathe in her apartment and have bad dreams. She may or may not be haunted and all that comes of the hauntings are various sounds and CG ghost-smoke that occasionally wafts around. Oh, and there's some telekinesis thrown in for bad measure.",1451606400,2,434,4.636363636363637

8713095,1,B00WFHTZTS,"Completely LAUGHABLE acting... some of the worst I've EVER seen. The plot was predictable and sedating, at best. I was asleep less than 1/2 way thru' this flick. Would fit well along side such cult-classics  as ""The Rocky Horror Show,"" as a COMEDY-HORROR SPOOF. An appropriate title, for a good BED-TIME BORE.",1463702400,,309,4.9423076923076925

8713099,1,B00WFHTZTS,"It's occasionally funny, but I don't think it's intended to be. The director and editor loved slow-motion and dissolves and used both to distraction. It starts out dumb and gets worse from there. There is no reason for anyone to watch this. Skip, your time is too valuable to waste on this ""film"".",1456444800,,297,4.622641509433962
