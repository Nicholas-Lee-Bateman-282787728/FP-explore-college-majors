8223630,1,B000WLVKOM,"This is crap. I was first alerted that something was wrong by the misuse of English language narrative. It was often unclear whether they were talking about the Germans or Russians. Poor understanding of military subject matter is also apparent when the narrator is trying to describe various units and tactics. There are broad, sweeping generalizations which are just not close to being factual. On top of all that, some dates and places are wrong. For example, they talk about the invasion of Sicily in July of 1944. Since we know that D-Day was June 6, 1944, and the invasion of Sicily was almost a year prior to that, it brings into question everything else in this crap ""documentary.""

If you are really interested in this subject, it is painful to watch this video. I am sad that the History Channel seems to have no standards regarding their choice of material to broadcast.",1391558400,,881,4.758169934640523
