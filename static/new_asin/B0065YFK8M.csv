8493630,2,B0065YFK8M,"Lindsay (Mary Charlotte Wilcox) has a dead daddy issue which manifests itself with her attending funerals so she can give the young male corpse a long kiss. She is found our by a cult of necrophiliacs who for some reason wear hooded robes like a satanic cult. She also marries Lyle Waggoner which really doesn't work out because he wants to be on top and move and stuff.

That is pretty much it. Add some Mary Wilcox nudity, including some male nudity

Well preserved for a 1972 film. Most likely because they didn't show it much. Not too many extras.",1402617600,,551,4.5
