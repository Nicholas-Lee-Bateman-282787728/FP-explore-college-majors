8250069,5,B0013D8LVS,"Having read various reviews about this film with average or low rating, i didn't expect much. Also, having seen the other pink films like ""MADAME O"", ""SLAVE WIDOW"" and ""NAKED PURSUIT"" i didn""t had high hopes with The Bite. But, i was very surprised and impressed!! All the other films were good, but i always felt that something was missing. Not here though. Kan Mukai's The Bite has everything. Brilliant, extraordinary direction. The camera work is amazing. Stunning photography although the transfer is not perfect. Great story, with a plot that progresses into a thrilling suspenseful finale. The music/soundtrack is really fantastic. It adds a lot. The Bite avoids the serious melancholic tone of the other films mentioned above. It's artsy but also entertaining. It's like a sleazy new wave film. The pace is very fast at times, but also slow and atmospheric during the erotic scenes which are expertly shot, without being too slow or too long! The Bite is one of the best exploitation films i have ever seen. It has the right combination of action, drama and sleaze, delivered with aristocratic style. The Bite has  strong emotions, it's not cold and flat like the other films. It simply puts the viewer right into the action. The Bite has it's messages, too. How far can a man go? What is natural in sex? How important is money and an easy way of life? ?his is a classic film. I loved it.",1406592000,,1396,4.744855967078189

8250071,1,B0013D8LVS,"`Hate to disagree w/ the other Reviewer, but this one was a major disappointment all around. There is nothing 'artsy' about it - it`s dull, badly subtitled, poorly acted and directed, and for a film that`s promoted as sexploitation, it has no slave girls, precious little nudity and no one you would EVER want to see nude. (This is the only good thing about it being B+W). And, it`s no better than 'Slave Widow', which also sucked but had a better story, and nowhere near as delightful as 'Madame O', which was far better than I thought it would be (read my review) after sitting through this cinematic swill... another example of deceptive marketing (Grindhouse Sexploitation Collection, my a#@), avoid this one completely, and ignore the other review.",1267574400,3,753,4.890625
