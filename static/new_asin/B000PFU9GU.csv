8190944,5,B000PFU9GU,"The personal touch on this interview (which has a welcome informality) gives it more weight, particularly with Smith recounting his father arguing with his uncle about whether the true path of religion lay along the liberal path or the fundamentalist path.  (I think that is a false dichotomy, but I don't think that is Smith's point.)  As a man who has done much to bring the world's religions to public attention in a respectful way, and who has explored his own spirituality in some of those traditions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Sufism, etc.), it's interesting hearing Smith's personal take on his own native religion, describing the social forces at work at the beginning of fundamentalist Christianity, and how those tensions continue to play out.

The interview may seem tedious to some since Smith is on in years and speaks very slowly in spite of his obvious lucidity.",1224720000,5,871,4.993103448275862
