8301073,1,B001F6HY3O,"This was essentially a silent film, only background noises and one announcement about the head of the Olympics.  THAT'S ALL!  . Disk one and two are almost the same and the 3rd of the closing was over half just people and contestants walking around. Then when that ended it was a lack luster show for the closing, TOTAL WASTE OF TIME and very boring. Watch PBS which shows it with complete commentary.",1236038400,,401,4.555555555555555
