5077576,5,B007CJL17I,"My whole family enjoys gathering together to watch this show. And despite some misleading reviews, there is nothing inappropriate about the show. Kids love monsters and they get them here, albeit goofy monsters. Certainly the best thing I've seen on Disney Channel in a long time.",1337040000,7,280,5.108695652173913
5077577,5,B007CJL17I,"Just a note.....according to the WB video site, the movie is included along with all 13 episodes. The show has also been renewed for a second season.",1335744000,8,149,4.555555555555555
5077578,5,B007CJL17I,"After Hannah Montana and The Suite Life ended we were only left with Wizards of Waverly Place. Now that that show ended it's safe to say Disney went completely south. Well, this show is the only show that keeps Disney Channel alive in my book. All the other shows are pretty much the same things happening every episode. This show deals with a bunch of different supernatural things like vampires, werewolves, witches, etc. It's really exciting! The character Erica actually reminds me of the character Darla from Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, and Benny, Ethan, and Rory are kind of like Xander Buffy. Anyways, being a fan of vampires (not the Twilight kind) makes this show really good, exciting, and definitely worth watching!",1335657600,27,734,4.92741935483871
5077579,1,B007CJL17I,"I watched this on the Disney Channel when it first aired, and was disappointed that they are trying to go along with the current ""vampire"" stories out there, and sell it to younger kids.  This is much scarier and bloody than what the cover lets on.  My kids are teenagers, and we found it offensive.  The story line was nonexistent and did not see that much thought or depth was put into this by Disney.
If they keep making trash like this,all of their audience will go to Nickelodeon.",1335139200,3,485,4.426966292134831
5077580,5,B007CJL17I,"This is a diamond in the rough. There are so many silly kids shows out there that aim at the lowest common denominator. This one does not do that. Yes, it does go for that vampire craze that's going around since twilight. But in a lot of ways it does it better. I haven't seen twilight, but I know it's basic gist and this is better. It gives you that vampire fun without straying away from family friendly. The writing and the acting are top notch.
A lot of the fans swoon over the two leads Matthew Knight and Atticus Mitchell. They do a very good job of being lovable geeks on a quest to be cool, whilst fighting the forces of the evil supernatural. However, the real strong acting talent in this show comes from the third male lead, Cameron Kennedy. His character is silly, and at times not on the same page as the rest. But he has the most comedic and dramatic talent of all of them, and deserves a big acting career cause he has the chops. He doesn't just seem like he's reading lines when he ""get's his geek on"" the way Knight does. He really owns the part.  If the show was just Cameron's character it would still be almost as entertaining. He needs more screen time, to say the least. The female leads Vanessa Morgan and Kate Todd are beautiful and funny. They are both tough and smart. They are perfect for their roles and make the show as well.

This show gets a 10/10.",1331769600,29,1380,4.263358778625954

Seriously stop reading the review and buy it.  Haha.  What I was super impressed with though when it came to the movie was they pieced it together so it's one complete movie.  Like with most made for TV movies there's a bit of black when it goes to the commercial, and then it comes back.  If you watch the movie enough times on TV you know where they break for commercial but on the DVD it's as if it's a theater experience.  To be honest I haven't even watched any episodes from the DVD, because I just wanted the movie, but if you enjoyed the series on TV you will enjoy the DVD as it has all the episodes.  Vanessa Morgan is a goddess to me so I had to buy it.  Insanely recommended.",1356393600,,851,4.011904761904762

5077631,5,B007CJL17I,"Okay, so when I first heard about this show, I didn't think it was going to be any good. For one, the title seemed pretty stupid and I'm not really into the vampire stuff but I was surprised when I watched this show and totally fell in love with it. And Atticus Mitchell.

The episodes and the movie are all really fun to watch and if you have little kids, you don't have to worry about scaring them because it's mostly kind of silly Wizards- of- Waverly Place magic and supernatural stuff, not serious and bloody.

Anyways, this show is great and it has amazing actors. It's probably my favorite Disney show right now and I recommend it to all ages. 5/5!",1351209600,,655,4.360655737704918

Now for the review. I've been to other sites and saw a lot of parents disapprove of the show. If you think the show is inappropriate don't let your children watch it. It's up to parents to make that decision for their household. For me though if it's obsession that's driving you to watch or read the supernatural then it's a dangerous thing. However if you're doing it for recreation then let it be a learning experience and an opportunity to talk to your kids about what's real and what's not.

TV shows and movies about vampires,werewolves or witches for that matter aren't a new concept in entertainment. When Twilight came out that propelled this trend into a phenomenon. The average person who watches these shows sees it as an experience but to a christian because they believe the occult is real it is frightening. Thus fear plays a role when it comes to watching a movie or reading a book as this might invite demonic activity in their home. Just because the hero has unusual powers doesn't necessarily mean the show is outright demonic. What concerns me though are the slasher movies ie,Saw,Halloween,Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc. Vampires,werewolves,Harry Potter are all work of fiction but not a homicidal sociopath who kills people which you read everyday in the news. This is evil and it's real.",1344124800,6,1717,4.713333333333333
5077633,5,B007CJL17I,If you lOve vambires and action this is for you who does not like a hot baby sitter to take care of them,1343779200,2,104,3.5652173913043477
5077634,5,B007CJL17I,"I remember seeing the commercials for the movie. My first thought: ""Wow, it looks like Disney fell into the whole vampire fad."" I find nothing wrong with vampires, but the media seemed to be milking this idea in the past couple of years. Out of curiousity, I sat down and watched ""My Babysitter's a Vampire"" when it aired on TV.

As soon as the movie was done, I hit pause, stared with mouth agape, and decided to record the movie on my PVR. Before the night was over, I watched it again. This movie has a creative blend of humor and action. I even found myself not gagging at the ever-so-slight romantic parts. All in all, you're going to get a satisfying humorous adventure out of this movie.

Now to the series. This is now on my top favorite TV show list. Like its movie, the show is creatively done. The characters, both new and old, are relatable and lovable. The action and comedy still remain.

For the parents: If you are skeptical about letting your child watch this Disney channel show, you honestly don't have much to worry about, even though this show seems to be geared more towards a slightly older crowd. The main characters stake a vampire or two, but when that happens, the vampire just turns to dust. No gore. And when a vampire does ""feed"", my little cousin always says that the blood just looks like red food coloring.

I'm completely satisfied with this season 1 DVD; it was worth every penny. Hats off to the creator, director, and everyone else involved in this 'fang'tastic show.",1342051200,6,1504,4.538745387453875
