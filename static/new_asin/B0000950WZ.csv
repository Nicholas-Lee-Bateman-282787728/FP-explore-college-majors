8177789,1,B0000950WZ,"You'll rally behind Rossi until you realize GP vet Alex Barros (2 stroke Honda) gave him fits by the end of the year.  Barros is the man!  The narration is boring yet classic old school English and for some crazy reason, they turned the motor noise down.  Some sound editors just don't get it.  This was the last year they ran two strokes.

Rossi is one cool cat,  Always check for his finish line antics.  On one he sits up on the tank sideways and waves to the crowd.
Also, check the consistency of these beautiful GP tracks around the world.  Nothing like that here in the states.  Why do we build these multi-million dollar NASCAR facilities just to watch young studs turn left?",1082592000,7,682,4.435483870967742
8177790,2,B0000950WZ,"With the arrival of the new 4 strokes and their magnificent sounding engines Duke video could have hit a home run with this DVD, but to my great dismay and frustration they struck out. Duke have yet another northern English sound alike in Jack Burnickle commentating. Not only does Mr Burnickle's droll delivery dampen any sense of excitement his voice is dubbed over the original audio with the resulting muting of the actual race sounds.  Why can't Duke use a combination of Nick Harris, Randy Mamola and Dennis Noyes (at least for the American market)?. In addition the seismic shift from two to four strokes is given a scant 90 seconds in the introduction.
Thankfully the visuals are good, otherwise I would have sent the DVD back to Duke.",1061424000,11,743,4.75968992248062
