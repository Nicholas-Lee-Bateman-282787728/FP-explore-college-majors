Newcomer NIcholas Galitzine is a star in the making, Verity Pinter is lovely & Luke Perry is still rockin' at 50! This film is a fun ride for all rock/pop/music fans out there and anyone who is reaching for their dream!",1477008000,4,307,4.685185185185185

Nicholas is an incredile new actor, i can't wait to see him in more films. Plus Luke Perry is in this movie and who doesn't love Luke ;)",1439856000,2,285,4.296296296296297

8718716,5,B00YP65N70,"I'd probably give this movie a 4-1/2, but would rather err on the high side because I really enjoyed it.  The storyline  and the characters were both engaging, and then the music took it up to the next level for me. I thought the songs were really good, and Nicholas Galitzine's singing in the role of Tom was excellent.  Great role for Luke Perry as well!  I'll definitely watch it again!",1519344000,2,389,4.436619718309859

8718721,4,B00YP65N70,"The Beat Beneath My Feat is a hard-rockin flick featuring strong performances and a heartwarming narrative. 90210 heartthrob Luke Perry and newcomer Nicholas Galitzine have a unique chemistry as two musicians who hold the keys to each others emotional prison cells. Director John Williams (who directed music videos for Coldplay and Radiohead) manages to seamlessly weave mesmerizing music sequences into the story in a way that perfectly parallels the events of the plot. The film manages to extend itself beyond the clich high school loser redemption film, making it a truly enjoyable, toe-tapping experience.",1477526400,4,611,5.51063829787234
