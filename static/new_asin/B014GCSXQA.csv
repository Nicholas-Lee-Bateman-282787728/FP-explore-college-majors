7391443,1,B014GCSXQA,I literally felt like I was watching an HR video on how not to act in the workplace.,1470614400,,84,3.7222222222222223
7391444,4,B014GCSXQA,"Fairly good movie, with a descent ending for a gay romance, but the English accents are so thick you need sub titles to understand what they are saying.",1463443200,,152,4.464285714285714
7391445,1,B014GCSXQA,I checked it today and it is still playing a mother's instinct.  I give up.,1457222400,,75,4.0
7391446,5,B014GCSXQA,Rented title and it now plays the proper film.,1456444800,3,46,4.222222222222222
7391447,1,B014GCSXQA,"Unless you're willing to watch a totally different movie than the one that is indicated, do not purchase this product until the issues have been resolved.  The movie that is linked to this digital product is ""A Mother's Instinct.""",1454716800,3,230,4.897435897435898
7391448,1,B014GCSXQA,"Awful acting, awful dialogue, awful cinematography. I'm not a picky person when it comes to movies, I even like some really bad ones, and I can usually finish an awful movie, but this one was just too painful.",1474934400,3,209,4.526315789473684
7391449,3,B014GCSXQA,"This is one of those very low budget stories that, in spite of some bad acting by the auxiliary actors, leads us through some of the ridiculous connections one makes, on the way to finding the right partner. Fortunately, the lead character, a ""Joseph Average III,"" has the inner strength, despite many insecurities, to know what kind of person is really appropriate for him and walks away who are not. This is a very slow, easy movie to be watched when one is just looking for something relaxing, rather than eventful.",1473638400,,518,4.7032967032967035
7391450,1,B014GCSXQA,"For a movie like this to work (in which the hero is a gay man looking for Mr Right) there has to be something about the hero that makes the audience care about him. It's okay if he's ugly, fat and middle aged as long as he's also charming, or sweet, or feisty, or smart or funny. But when he's ugly, fat and middle aged AND every word he says sounds like whining, AND his only facial expression is a spoiled-baby poutand his behavior always perfectly agrees with his voice and his expressionwho cares? I sure didn't.

My overwhelming reaction was complete disbelief that such an obnoxious person would ever get even ONE date, much less an endless string of mennone of them spectacular but ALL of them more appealing than he iswho invariably want to have a serious relationship with him, but none of them are good enough for him. Evidently every gay man in San Francisco finds him irresistible, but his standards are too high. It's absurd. Exactly the same pattern repeats five or six times with different but interchangeable men, and it gets to be very annoying very, very fast.

The man he would finally end up with was obvious by the third minute of the movie, which made the long, moronic trek to the LAST three minutes even more unbearable than it would have been anyway. And several side storiesof mindless intra-office bitchiness, of an old man whose wife dies when her toaster catches fire, etcare just as stupid and irritating as the obnoxious gay guy's quest for Mr Right. And those side stories don't even reach any conclusions; they just get dropped along the way.

This is a stupid, irritating, completely unbelievable movie about an obnoxious man and the equally obnoxious people around him.",1473206400,5,1704,4.6923076923076925
7391451,5,B014GCSXQA,I enjoyed this movie. It was well done.,1472860800,,39,4.0
7391452,1,B014GCSXQA,Movie was poorly made,1472774400,,21,4.5
7391453,1,B014GCSXQA,Bland and bad acting!,1472515200,,21,4.5
7391454,5,B014GCSXQA,Entertaining film. Acting is OK but it is understandable. Story line is realistic and the characters have physical characteristics of what you may experience in real life. I related to this film as I live in SF. I like it and recommend if you'd like to be entertained with a non-hollywood film.,1471737600,,294,4.673076923076923
7391455,3,B014GCSXQA,Not too bad. The lead was a little predictable but it was good to see a lead who did not fit into the conventional.,1471651200,,115,3.8333333333333335
7391456,5,B014GCSXQA,Loved it.,1471651200,,9,4.0
7391457,2,B014GCSXQA,"Decent story.  The main character was painful to watch, mostly because he is a terrible actor.",1471219200,2,94,4.875
8730664,2,B014GCSXQA,Very amateurish and slow-moving.  Couldn't get through it all.,1533340800,,62,5.888888888888889
8730665,5,B014GCSXQA,"I totally loved this film. Another review described this best. You can see the flaws, it's hard to explain why, but this film so accurately portrays the average person in very real and comical ways. For those who didn't like this film, sorry but it wasn't meant to be an Oscar winning portrayal of something deep and moving. It was meant to take a look at regular people we see daily in a light and funny way.",1530230400,,409,4.324675324675325
8730666,3,B014GCSXQA,liked the love story,1529884800,,20,4.25
8730667,5,B014GCSXQA,A early film on the LGBT  movie  scene. So more subtle than later films. Always nice to see older gay films to see how far things have come.,1529366400,,140,3.9642857142857144
8730668,1,B014GCSXQA,"I will never get the 1 hr. 20 minutes back! Yes, it was clearly an indie, low budget film, but of course, that does not mean it is a terrible movie--except in this case. The acting was wooden, I didn't care about any of the charcters, no depth the main character and actually I found the actor somewhat annoying. And then the movie just kinda ended. Please do not waste your time watching this--binge on something else, watch an infomercial, or a game show--anything but this movie.",1529193600,,482,4.551724137931035
8730669,5,B014GCSXQA,Ya know how sometimes something isn't perfect but you really like it anyway? That's this movie. The acting wasn't amazing and the story was a bit cliche but for some reason I still really loved this movie. It wasn't just a movie about pretty people rotating through their grindr hookups looking for 'the one'. I wish I could better describe this movie and how it made me feel but I can't. I just highly suggest you watch it.,1528416000,,424,4.448717948717949
8730670,1,B014GCSXQA,I don't know how I did it but I made it through two-thirds of the movie but then I couldn't take anymore and bailed.  Uninteresting plot.  Weak to poor acting.  Obnoxious sound track.  Unlikable characters.  Boring and amateur directing.  Don't bother with this film unless you are drunk.  Hopefully you will pass out early.,1527465600,,324,4.888888888888889
8730671,1,B014GCSXQA,Wow - I couldn't even make it to end of movie.  I watched about 50% and could not take the torture any longer.  I think a high school acting class could do better.  To bad amazon didn't let us rate in the negative cause one star is one star to many.,1526083200,,249,3.843137254901961
8730672,1,B014GCSXQA,"This film was NOT a ""sweet romantic comedy"". It seems to focus on gay setups and hookups, but would be JUST AS BAD a film if the plot and actors were heterosexual, human-alien, or anything. Crap film separate from the social/cultural aspect. Amazon should tag these films with ""LBQT+"" so that some viewers can make informed choices for themselves and their families. And also tag this one ""1 star"", because it is. Sorry crowdfunders, this one doesn't make the cut.",1515715200,,464,4.8125
8730673,1,B014GCSXQA,"OMG... I don't even know where to begin.
 The script and dialogue were less than college level. The interactions with the characters were wooden and just hard to watch.
 The acting was absolutely horrendous! I can honestly say; I'm sure I will never encounter one of these actors in another film. Their must have been absolutely no budget to hire actors.
 The main character is the most annoying, obnoxious man. Whines through the whole movie. What anyone would see in a man like him... Just would boggle my mind.
 This movie continues the absurd trend; all gay men must be fairies, whining, self -absorbed. Its time to get real Gay themed movies... With likable, real multi -dimensional characters. Not just a cartoonish stereotypical idea.",1477872000,,741,4.951612903225806
