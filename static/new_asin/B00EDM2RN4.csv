5904499,3,B00EDM2RN4,"With two opposing reviews, I was not sure what to expect. I decided to take a chance and glad I did.

This is a movie directed at a younger audience but one older people can enjoy. It reminds me of a Disney movie, kinda like SpyKids. It is very G rated.

This is not a B movie. Everything is well done. Filming and audio are excellent.

Premise: Two teenage boys, sons of famous treasure hunters, plus cute girl, are off to find Mom and Dad and the missing pieces of Snow White's mirror.

Action is good. Well choreographed fight scenes, nothing harsh. Again, very G rated.

Acting: If there is any part where the movie lags, it is in the acting. It is not bad acting, but a movie geared toward younger audiences. The way the mother acts/talks came across as a bit ""different"" to me.

Family friendly: Yep, very family friendly. Just a few fight scenes. No bad words. No nekkid people. One cute kiss.

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was fun. It kept my attention the entire time. This is a movie I will rent again when my nephew is over for projector movie night when Grandma, Grandpa and little Sis are visiting. I think everyone will enjoy. There may be a sequel.

My reason for three stars. I rated media much more harshly than tangible merchandise. 5 is outstanding, 4 is great, 3 is pretty good. It is a solid 3.",1384473600,66,1326,4.361788617886178
5904500,1,B00EDM2RN4,"An intriguing idea, of the kind which has often been done well by Disney and others in movies (the old stories are true, from Snow White's mirror to Cinderella's slipper, etc., and there are clans of Hunters to protect them. It copies a couple of famous lines from the Indiana Jones saga, as well).

This movie was, frankly, terrible.

The previews looked like fun, but they give a misleading idea of the bulk of the movie; and several of the main actors do the best they can, and are good in spite of the terrible script and dialogue. Robbie Amell (who is currently starring on the new Tomorrow People), Lexa Vega (I know her from the Spy Kids movies but she's been in a ton of stuff), Keenan Tracy (with whom I was not previously familiar), and Victor Garber do their best with this script, but most of the other acting is absolutely terrible.

The writing doesn't even try to support the action, and the script is fraught with ""perils"" on the level of a Doctor Who Companion twisting an ankle. Michelle Forbes (Ro on one of the Star Trek shows) and Kira Clavell were particularly awful.

The very worst offenders were the four or five people who had credits for the writing, followed in a close second by the directing and editing.

There were really ridiculous product placements throughout the movie, that make all other product placement films seem slick and professional. This movie seems to have been an exercise by the producers to create a con in order to get money, only unlike most of the industry they didn't even put in an appearance of trying to have ""quality product.""

This movie deserves a negative rating if only that were possible. The forty or so people who gave it 7.5 on imdb must primarily be the family of people making money off it, because imdb is usually a good predictor of how bad a movie is.

But wait, there's more! Not only do you get these problems with Amazon's rental, but also the ""closed captioning"" which was a major part of my choosing this movie, doesn't work. Nothing at all happens for the first hour of the hour and a half. At one hour in to the movie, the captions suddenly start to kick in -- transcribing the beginning of the movie, an hour ago. Even the captions they couldn't bother to get right.",1383955200,6,2245,4.514778325123153

5904502,2,B00EDM2RN4,I got this movie because of the price..less than the 5 dollar Walmart bin.. and I did not know what to expect..  I gave it two stars because the photography was above average...  The plot line and dialogue were clearly below average...The acting was at least O.K.  nothing to write home about.  This is a kid movie and family friendly.  Not even close to the Indiana Jones series;  even though it is crystal clear that is what the writers were shooting for.  If you have an audience under 10 and do not mind it running in the background while you read the newspaper or are otherwise occupied...then this may be a movie for you.,1501200000,,627,4.447368421052632

5904553,1,B00EDM2RN4,"I seldom write reviews of movies, however, I felt that this one earned special treatment. This is not a movie for children or adults. I am willing to overlook the exceptionally bad acting, plot holes, and cliches that riddle this train wreck of a film. What I am not willing to overlook is how this movie panders to ethnic stereotyping and xenophobia.

  The borderline misogyny is rampant. The movie has a teenage female character that is introduced as a complete powerhouse who is able to take out a bad guy in a matter of seconds, however, as soon as the lead male is around she immediately turns into a highly submissive character who seems to be afraid to speak her mind even when she is the only one who notices that something is amiss simply because the two male leads are confident things are fine. And then there is the scene where they have to get dressed up to sneak into a location. Of course the female character only becomes attractive to the male lead the moment she puts on a dress and applies makeup. Seriously? The character starts off nearly as powerful as the original video game version of Lara Croft the Tomb Raider and becomes the equivalent of every early 2000's teen romance where the girl has to change herself to be noticed.

There is also a common theme that ""non-comfority is bad!"" The only character who has an even slightly different sense of fashion than the other characters is one of the bad guys. Another common theme throughout the movie is that wealth and consumption is all that matters in life. (Not surprising from a film sponsored by Wal Mart and the Walton family, which is made apparent with the not so subtle advertising scattered throughout the movie). This is done in a fairly subtle matter (by several characters suggesting that the only way to be cool is to be rich).

As a huge fan of B movies and adventure/treasure hunting movies (I grew up on Indiana Jones and even loved National Treasure for what it was) I was really hoping to enjoy this travesty. Sadly, I ended up wishing I had found one of their poorly constructed ""booby traps"" and been impaled by it long before the movie was halfway over.",1439510400,5,2149,4.571428571428571

But if you are an adult watching this for fun, you may find it boring, if you are a parent you may find it interesting... Really depends on the person. This movie was well-made, and starred lots of very famous actors and actresses, but lacked a good script write. Though the idea was creative the words didn't flow naturally...

No one tried to do to much and over act they just seemed to be themselves which we thought worked.  If your looking for lots of action your going to be disapointed there isn't a ton.  The action is built to help build the suspense not bring it up.  I would probably liken this to the National Tresure's but fairy stories.

Overall pretty good so long as your not expecting to much.  If you keep your expectations modest you will definitly be pleasently surprised.",1389139200,24,620,4.321739130434783

5904666,4,B00EDM2RN4,"This is a good suspenseful adventure that I really like and enjoy.
Paxton Flynn (Robbie Amell) and his brother, Tripp Flynn (Keenan Tracey), are unaware of their parents true line of work but they soon find out. When their parents go missing, the brothers and a friend decide to go hunting for 3 shards and an enchanted mirror. This beautiful enchanted mirror can grant you any wish. This hunt takes them all over the world to some great countries such as, Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada. Do they make the right choice in looking for the ancient artifacts?

 When you think of hunting you think of hunting animals or maybe even people, but in this film they hunt for ancient artifacts. This is very interesting and I like that the plot is somewhat unique and original with reminders of some well known childhood fairytales like, Snow White, Cinderella, and Red Riding Hood. It is very entertaining to see these little bits included in the film. These fairytales actually come to life which I like too. The cinematography of the scenery is breathtaking with gorgeous views of the mountainside and landscape. My favorite character is Dylan Savini (Alexa Vega), because she is very smart and knows exactly what to do in hard situations. Victor Garber (Mason Fuller) plays a great villain and makes you not like him because he is so believable and real at what he does. He is totally against the Hunters motto to find, protect and never use for evil. This film has great action with some awesome fighting scenes that are choreograph very well.
A great message is that sometimes the harder choices are the right choices and everyone is not who or what they seem to be.
I recommend The Hunters for ages 7 to 15; however it is great for the whole family to see and enjoy. There is really nothing to watch out for it you are under 7, except for the fighting scenes.
I give this film 4 out of 5 stars as it keeps my interest, is enjoyable and is very easy to understand.",1384732800,,1969,4.590909090909091
