8670088,4,B00M3TK8Y4,"If you want to see Pikachu (Ohtani Ikue) as an evil purse, and Inu Yasha in a purely comedic role, this is your anime.

A chest containing six magical jewels bursts open when super-fighter Bass (Yamaguchi Kappei) tries to stop the thief who stole them, and subsequently, he and his partner, the angel-winged Lime (Tamagawa Sakiko), must find the jewels before they contaminate the earth.  Pure hilarity ensues.

One of my all-time favorite, lighthearted slapstick adventures, with catchy theme songs, Jewel BEM Hunter Lime makes me wish they had continued the series and completed more episodes.",1439596800,,595,5.177083333333333
8670089,4,B00M3TK8Y4,"This is a re-release of a fun adventure/comedy OVA from the 90's which in turn was based off a series of game simulators from around the same time. There's only 3 episodes but each is pretty stand alone. It's a pity this never became a full series as the game introduced more characters and even more humorous monsters and antics, but this is still a clever little series.
I already have the prior release from Media Blasters but it's nice to know it's still available if I want to upgrade my collection.",1438473600,,504,4.489130434782608
8670090,1,B00M3TK8Y4,Yeah I have the original realese of this and it is only 90 minutes just like this one. I will assume that this one contain the incomplete collection also. How can it be finished if it is the same time length as the unfinished one.,1413590400,,230,4.133333333333334
