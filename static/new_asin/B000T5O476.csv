8207849,4,B000T5O476,"If you have read the other reviews, you know that the picture quality is bad and the fights scenes are pretty much terrible.  I would just like to add the fact that you probably aren't buying these for a quality film.  First of all, any DVD package that says ""Grindhouse Experience Presents"" is pretty much a giant warning sign saying that the picture quality will suck, that acting will probably be terrible, and that the movie overall will be bad.  Another warning sign would be that fact that you get ten films for eighteen bucks.  Overall, these films are terrible, but if you like ""Grindhouse"" films, this is great; if you are looking for good quality, find something else.",1201046400,2,678,4.6722689075630255
8207850,1,B000T5O476,"I've just given in to the temptation to pic up this ""10 film dvd set"" under the assumption that it was a remastered, repackaged re-release of films featured in the Return of the Dragon Pack and Fist of Fury Legacy collection, both released in 2003-04 by Video Asia. Don't let the additions of Kung Fu Superman and Muscle of the Dragon fool you...if you already own the Return of the Dragon Pack and Fist of Fury Legacy, you'll want to save your money because once you open the box, you'll find those 2 series and a double feature containing Kung-Fu Superman and Muscle of the Dragon and slap yourself miserably for assuming that VideoAsia would give us an upgrade(ie, Star of Stars with ALL of the widescreen feature and subtitles, Enter the Game of Death WITHOUT the shakiness of the picture,etc). Good films...except for The Dragon Lives Again...but nothing new. For reviews of the other films, lookup the Return of the Dragon Pack and Fist of Fury Legacy individually.",1195603200,4,971,4.7514792899408285
8207851,3,B000T5O476,"The official title of this DVD set is ""Grindhouse Experience Presents: Ultimate Dragon Collection - 10 Film Set"".  It is a 3 DVD set.  The first disc is single sided with 2 films and the other two discs are both double sided with 2 films per side (see my submitted images for details).  The films are as follows (all are full screen unless noted):

Disc 1: Kung Fu Superman (ws)& Muscle of the Dragon. (note:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Superman-Muscle-of-the-Dragon/dp/B0002C4J76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Superman/Muscle of the Dragon</a>&nbsp;is sold separately, but for $5-$10 more, depending on where you buy it, you're getting 8 additional films with this set)
Disc 2/Side A: Dragon Lives Again & Bruce Lee: Star of Stars (ws)
Disc 2/Side B: Enter the Game Of Death (ws) & Mission of the Dragon
Disc 3/Side A: Ching Wu and Shaolin Kung Fu parts 1 & 2
Disc 3/Side B: Fist of Fury 3 & Return of Fist of Fury

I haven't watched the films straight through as of yet so instead of plot I'll stick to quality & format issues in this review.  Don't get this set expecting nice quality film prints because they probably never looked any better to begin with.  Basically everything here has that slightly blurred but mostly watchable look of low budget films found on public domain collections.  Some are definitely better than others.  I found Kung Fu Superman & Enter the Game of Death to have slightly better film quality with the Ching Wu films having the worst.  The other films fall somewhere in the middle.  If you're used to this type of varying quality then you'll more than likely find everything at least watchable.  Sound is another issue.  Although KF Superman & Enter feature some of the better film quality they also both have a low pitched hum in their soundtrack, but it's not enough to really distract you.  Sound in the other films ranges from good to ok.  Everything is english dubbed (some really badly) with the exception of Bruce Lee: Star of Stars which I believe is in mandarin, but features english subtitles.  Also for some reason Muscle of the Dragon has spanish subtitles on the film print.  All but 3 films are displayed in full screen format and in some cases this cuts off action and actors.

All in all, what you're getting with this set are 10 films of varying quality (for the price of one) from the 70s sub-genre of ""Bruceploitation"", named so for featuring several actors such as Bruce Li and Dragon Lee doing their best ""Bruce Lee"".  In other words these and many other cheaply made kung fu flicks exploited the fame of the late Bruce Lee by using actors that resembled and acted like him.  Some films go as far as to rip off titles of Bruce Lee films such as this set's Enter the Game of Death (combining Enter the Dragon & Game of Death) and Return of Fist of Fury (Fists of Fury aka The Big Boss).  You'll appreciate this set if you like all things 70s kung fu and aren't put off by low budget, bad dubbing, and mediocre film quality.  Some might say those all go hand in hand with this type of collection.  Just go into it knowing you aren't getting the cream of the kung fu crop here.  This is obviously released in hopes of appealing to the fans of ""grindhouse"" drive in movies (especially riding on the popularity of the Rodriguez/Tarantino double feature) but kung fu junkies like myself should find something to like here.  There are definitely better starting points for the genre that I highly recommend such as:

Definitely look into what the Dragon Dynasty series (that 36th Chamber of Shaolin is a part of) has to offer.  If you're seeking out more low budget kung fu craziness and want a lot for your buck try this:
