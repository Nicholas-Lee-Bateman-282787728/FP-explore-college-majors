Though the graphics are not as good as todays, it was definately the predecessor of the excellent anime of today.  I feel it has much better characters, ethics, morality and overall story line than anything since on a global scale. It is a much more realistic and believable show(except for the very end where Treliana takes-out Prince Zordan's ship). I was a really big fan.  I even had a few of the cards and comic books they made based on the show.  My brother and I would rush home to do our homework as fast as possible in order to watch the 3:00PM show.  We were so jealous when a friend of ours actually owned the dye-cast metal model of the Argo.  We were both searching and trying to get a hold of the series for years.  I almost got them in the early 90s while at a comics convention at the Expo Center.  No go.  Finally I started to search for the Star Blazers online.  Enter Amazon.com.  There are other sites where you can order the Star Blazers but Amazon.com was quite a bit cheapier than the others I found.  Once again, The Star Balzers are off to protect the world they love and cherish but not before having to break a few rules.  After receiving a mysterious message from Treliana of Telezart, Deputy Commander Derek Wildstar and do-it-all genius Sandor are convinced that the approaching comet is much more than what it seems. The Earth Defense Leaders do not agree with Wildstar or Sandor.  So they send word to all the ex-Star Force members to join them on a voluntary basis aboard the Argo for another long and dangerous mission.  Everyone shows up, including the great yet reluctant pilot, Mark Venture.  First they have to commondere (steal) the Argo by blasting it out of its underwater dock and then they fire the main guns to blow-up and get by one the satellites that make-up part of the Earth Defense.  If that's not enough, they are being chased by the new bigger and better star-class ship, the Andromeda with orders to stop the Star Force at all costs.  In true Star Blazer fashion the Andromeda, despite exceptional evasive manuvering by the Argo, catches-up to the Argo for a showdown.  Once in firing range the Andromeda's Captain Gideon lets the Star Force go and wishes them luck on their mission.  This is were the defeated Gamilons interplay.  The Gamilons have hooked-up with the Comit Empire after their leader, Deslok, was rescued while floating in space by the Empire and restored to health.  Deslok makes a pact with the leader of the Comit Empire, Prince Zordan, that he will destroy the Star Force for the Empire.  The Star Blazers do not know it but they are headed for a trap set by the Gamilons, who await their little visit to Treliana's home planet of Telezart.  While coming up on the planet Barracus, after defeating several space carriers, the Star Force picks-up the Space Marines who are very rough and tough group who literally run and attack space tanks.  The Comet Empire continually underestimates the Star Force.  The Argo goes on to defeat fleet after fleets of the Comet Empire and Gamilon Forces and beat their traps while on the way to Telezart.  The Space Marines check the planet for any signs of the enemy.  The surface of the planet is made-up of seens of a once thriving civilization completly destroyed.  They get attacked by Comet Empire space tanks, which with the help of Wildstar and the Black tigers are quickly taken out.  Once down on Telezart Derek Wildstar, Mark Venture, Sandor and the medical technition Nova finally meet Treliana.  She tells the Star Force that the Comet is really the Comet Empire, a huge ship made to look like a massive comet that conquers other planets who submit to them and destroy those who do not.  The comet is headed for Treliana's planet next and there is nothing she can do.  It turns out that Treliana has incredible psyic powers and that the destrution to her planet was caused by her powers, which she refuses to ever use again because of what happened to her planet.  Once they leave Treliana the Comet destroys her planet but not without sustaining considerable damage making the Comet Empire slow down and alter course for the first time ever.  She did this after Mark Convinced her to.  The final battle with Deslok takes place, probably the creshendo of the Comit Empire series.  The Argo is so badly damaged that it can not use its wavemotion gun or most of its main guns.  Just as Deslok was about to fire upon the Argo with his mighty Deslok gun, Sandor tells Wildstar to go to warp.  Though slightly hesitant, Mark warps the Argo right into the hull of Deslok's flagship.  To arms!  Wildstar orders to board Deslok's ship.  In order to protect Nova during the firefight, Mark gets shot and floats off the ship and into space.  The Andromeda and the rest of the Earth's defense forces are completly wiped-out.  Captain Gideon sends one last message to Wildstar, ""attack the Comet Empire from below"".  With the help of Deslok the Star Force attacks the Comet Empire from below and entered the fighter ship hanger and blow-up the Comet Empire ship from within via a fantastic firefight by The Space Marines, Wildstar and Sandor.  Even though the Comet Empire ship blows up another ship emerges from the smoke, destroying the Argo's guns and firing on the Earth. Treliana Brings Mark's body onto the abandoned Argo with Derek and Nova who were about to ram the Comet Empire.  Treliana ends the conflict by using her powers to destroy Prince Zordans ship.  I left so much out.  You have to watch this series again! Or for the first time.  This is a great one for kids.",972604800,15,5747,4.601769911504425
7864208,5,6304174675,"Like the other reviewers, I looked forward to this show each day after school.  Hooked on sci-fi by Star Trek and Star Wars, this show took my  appreciation of the genre to new heights.  The best thing about this  cartoon was that it evolved as time went on.  Starting out with a primitive  look and simple characters, the show's look and feel developed a depth few  small screen attempts at sci-fi have equalled.  A LOT of thought went into  the design of the technology and the backplot for this show.  Don't let the  naysayers convince you that it's just a cartoon.  Anyone who's serious  about their sci-fi should own these videotapes.",967507200,5,639,4.648648648648648
7864209,5,6304174675,"Every weekday at 3:30, the local channel ran this show.  I remember the ship with the large hole in the front that could do some nasty damage to anyone in its path.  I also remember falling in love with the sci fi genra  because of this show.  Now I get the video of the second series which got  cut off when I was a kid.  This set is what I had dreamed of having when a  kid.  The entirety of each series in a collection as opposed to seperate  video tapes with two episodes each.  Each of the collection tapes have four  episodes or more each.  As I watched I remembered how well developed the  characters were, which is quite a bit for a cartoon, in fact I forgot I was  watching a cartoon, this is probably due to the increadible story of this  saga.  I highly recomend this for anyone that grew up with this cartoon.",958176000,6,821,4.13375796178344
