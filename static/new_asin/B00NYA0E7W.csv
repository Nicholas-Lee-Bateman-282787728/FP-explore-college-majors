6684643,3,B00NYA0E7W,"I bought this DVD in tandem with its' partner cannibalistic flik: ""Mondo Cannibal"" - both films helmed by Italian director Bruno Mattei and apparently shot back 2 back in the Philippines (standing in for Amazonia) and originally released in 2003.

The DVD box art makes ""In the Land of Cannibals"" look like a typical cannibal-fest replete with lotsa hideous primitive tortures and flesh eating - BUT - this particular movie actually has relatively little  'cannibalism' portrayed.

The minimalist plot involves a group of US soldiers who have been dispatched to rescue a politician's daughter from a fate worse than death after she and her expeditionary party have disappeared in the recesses of the Amazon jungle.

Several of the actors from ""Mondo Cannibal"" are back - but in different roles in this film.  The characterizations and action are generally more plausible in this film, but what it makes up for in general 'quality', it loses in terms of 'fun' and cannibal content.

The plot basically follows the soldiers as they trek through the dense underbrush with their 'guide' and every time they have an encounter with hostile natives they just blow them away with their superior fire-power.  Mattei reprises one 'famous' scene from Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" where a native woman is brutally murdered for her adulteress activities by her jilted mate ( she is later eaten by her tribe) - but there are relatively few other flesh-eating scenes presented.

When the mercenaries finally arrive at the camp where they find the object of their search they discover that the 'white' woman has been elevated to the status of a sex goddess by the local tribe ( they like her blond hair!) and is kept in a drugged state until she is forced to come forth to participate in dance rituals.  This is the only area of the flik where any skin is on display... mostly provided by some bare breasted 'natives' and the 'fun' is quickly ended when the rescuers torch the village's grass huts and try to make their escape.  The 'big question' in these type of flix is generally: ""who makes it out alive"" and I'll leave it to the viewer to discover that answer for themselves, if they deign to check out this trite bit of cannibalistic foolishness.

Over-all what this film provides is a lot of 'tensions' between the soldiers and many scenes of indigenous tribal folk getting mowed down by automatic weapons. Although it was an OK watch - ultimately it proved disappointing due to its' lack of actual cannibal action.  If one wishes to invest in either of these two recent Mattei re-releases I'd recommend ""Mondo Cannibal"" - it's derivative and cheezy but at least itz amusing.  This film is presented in Full-Screen format with a good clear picture quality - the only extra is the original trailer for the film.",1417737600,4,2811,4.867924528301887
6684644,1,B00NYA0E7W,"A movie directed by Bruno Mattei in 2004. Anyone who gets attracted to or gives a try to a film with such as explicit title and DVD cover is looking for an exploitation film. So, my point is that you will not get much of that here. I based my evaluation on (i) how this film added anything new to the cannibal and exploitation genre, and (ii) how the film would please movie fans with imaginative gore scenes. Well, the film fails miserably on both. First, the film adds very little, with the exception that our main character consists of a soldier platoon with the mission to figure out the fate of some missing people, pretty much like the original Predator entry. The rest of the action follows the classic story of R. Deodato or U. Lenzi films. This caveat would not be the biggest concern to me should the film delivers what is intended to as an exploitation movie. Unfortunately, you will see very little gore. You will get a few instances of cannibals eating chunks of raw meat, and not much nudity either except for natural nudity by tribal women. Finally, and to complete the picture, the film does not have a single scene with sexual content. Overall then, a cannibal movie without any of the main ingredients of films from this subgenre. Avoid unless you collect these films, and find a copy for no more than 5 dollars (shipping included).

To be fair, the film is technically in good shape. This DVD release by Inter Vision is region 1, comes in nice widescreen format. The movie runs for 94 min. Audio is in English, and no subtitles are provided. Extras include the trailer only.",1417651200,7,1593,4.550522648083624
6684645,5,B00NYA0E7W,"Fans of the old Italian cannibal movies like Cannibal Ferox and Cannibal Holocaust will dig In the Land of Cannibals.  The movie also rips off Predator, especially in the last half.  The hilariously bad dubbing and the tough as nails cheesy soldiers of fortune make this one a fun b-movie watch.  Don't go into taking it seriously, or think it's scary.  Instead, imagine so bad it's good.  It really helps if you enjoy the old school cannibal movies, or else you won't dig it, which is understandable.  Limited audience.  Won't please the masses.  Some low grade gore, a little nudity, and action thrown in the mix as well.",1416182400,3,623,4.703703703703703
6684646,2,B00NYA0E7W,"If you are expecting a lost classic from the original era of the italian cannibal film (late 70s/early 80s), you will be sorely disappointed. This Mattei cheapie was one of his last films, made in 2003 and has NONE of the spontaneous charm or grindhouse realism of say Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox. What we have is a more gory equivalent of an awful SyFy original movie. I half expected a giant CGI snake to jump out and eat everyone alive, thereby saving me from the rest of the film's runtime but no dice.

Honestly, its my fault for not conducting better research about what I bought, but the DVD covers do a good job at making you think you could watch this film back to back with Slave of the Cannibal God. But really you don't want to watch this crap at all. Mattei had some accidental classics with Hell of the Living Dead, but late in his career his movies were really scraping the bottom such as what happens here.

Two stars only for Intervision, whom release great genre titles and I support fully, but why they chose to release this is beyond me. Fans of italian horror and the cannibal subgenre steer clear of this release.",1415836800,,1144,4.4688995215311005

8681055,4,B00NYA0E7W,"This film. also known as LAND OF DEATH and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST 3: CANNIBAL VS. COMMANDO, was made immediately after late director/co-screenwriter Bruno Mattei's god-awful CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST: THE BEGINNING (a.k.a. MONDO CANNIBAL - 2003), who used the pseudonym ""Martin Miller"" here as a director, but his real name on the screenplay he co-wrote with producer Gianni Paolucci (ARGENTO'S DRACULA 3-D - 2012), so you would think it was just as terrible as Mattei's first film. Well, in a way, it is, but somehow Mattei manages to show a little restraint here in the gore department (while there still is plenty for those looking for such things), but the biggest difference from the first film is that this one is basically a rip-off of PREDATOR (1987; which Mattei also ripped-off for his ROBOWAR in 1988), using a cannibal tribe instead of an alien. As a matter of fact, after the first 30 minutes, you could make a drinking game of ""Spot The PREDATOR References"" and be drunk within 20 minutes. The daughter of an important Senator, Sara Armstrong (Cindy Matic; the star of Mattei's first 2003 cannibal film) is somehow captured by a tribe of cannibals in the Brazilian Amazonia jungle (just how it happened is not made clear) and the first commando mission sent out to rescue her was never heard from again. So, our government tries again, this time with another commando squad, led by Lt. Wilson (Lou Randall), who is only on his second mission (!), whose other commandos include female ass-kicker Vasquez (Ydalia Suarez), token black commando Sgt. Cameron (Silvio Jiminez), Kruger (Santi Larrauri) and Irishman Smith (Kenny Krall). Their trackers will be Romero (Claudio Morales, who was dubbed by the late Ted Rusoff in that distinctive voice) and local Isias (Brando, Jr., basically in the Sonny Landham role from the original film this one rips off). Also along for the trip is a captive cannibal from the tribe who stole Sara (Why is beyond me.). The film opens with a tribe of cannibals having a human lunch when two helicopters fly overhead. They land at a command post, where Lt. Wilson and his team are introduced to their trackers and what exactly their mission is by Oliveira (Brando, Sr.). The fact that everyone finds out that this is only Lt. Wilson's second mission hardly instills any confidence in him with his team or the trackers. Everyone traverses the jungle carefully and they find a small encampment where C-Rations were eaten, so Romero and Isias know they are on the right track. Romero discovers a maggot-ridden corpse, which Romero determines was the last tracker sent out with the previous commando team. Romero says that he was a better tracker than him or Isias (while one of the commandos pukes) and that he knew this land better than him. Not a good sign. Romero can also tell by their captive cannibal's actions that they are well-within his tribe's territory, so he makes the cannibal snort a cocaine-like substance which will keep him happy and docile (something cocaine definitely doesn't do!). Isias finds a wild pig and kills it (off-screen, but we do see him pull out the guts and throw a piece to the cannibal) and the entire commando team have a dinner of the other white meat. Now is where the PREDATOR references and rip-offs kick-in. Isias stands on a log and just stares out into the jungle, saying something is in the trees but he can't see them. He makes some obscure ""hummingbird"" reference (which makes absolutely no sense) and the commandos move on. The captive cannibal escapes by hitting Kruger in the face with a rock (Hey, wait a minute. I thought he was given a happy drug!) and Smith catches him but is hit in the arm by a curare-tipped blow dart. Instead of dying a painful death (there is no antidote for curare), Romero shoots and kills him (Vasquez promises that she will carve his name in the flesh of the cannibal that killed him [she doesn't]). Lt. Wilson and his team then kill a bunch of attacking cannibals by blowing the hell out of the jungle, but a few of the cannibals get away. We then watch a cannibal at the side of a lake killing his wife with a stone knife for being unfaithful to her (this scene is surprisingly tame for Mattei, as the cannibal eats her innards, but there are no close-ups of him doing so). Romero says this cannibal will lead them to their target, even though Vasquez wants to kill him. They follow him back to his tribe, but the commandos are surprisingly treated as equals (lots of exposed women's breasts here). The Chief of the tribe shows them the dead rotting bodies of the commandos sent before them, caused by the tribe that kidnapped Sara Armstrong. The friendly tribe have a meal with the commandos, which consists of a dish made with monkey testicles. The commandos head down river with some canoes supplied by the tribe and find skinned human beings hanging from a tree (Sound familiar?). They then find the cannibal tribe they are looking for, as they are smoking a woman out of a tree and then eating her when she falls out. The commandos follow the cannibal tribe to their village and begin to kill every tribe member they see. They are thanked by another tribe (But can they be trusted?), in which Romero strips naked (with a loincloth) to gain their trust. The rest of the commandos follow suit, but all they find is the rotting bodies of the rest of the last commandos and learn that Sara Armstrong is the new Local Love Goddess of another cannibal tribe (cannibals have never seen a blonde-haired woman before), but keep her in a drugged state. If they were to take Sara away out in the open, none of the commandos would make it out alive, so they have to come up with a plan that will keep them all alive. The commandos set the village on fire that night, but keep the native deaths to a minimum by firing their weapons in the air (they only kill the ones that confront them). Lt. Wilson knocks-out a whacked-out, uncooperative Sara and radios-in for backup, but the response they get is that it is not possible where they are (I guess this Senator doesn't have as much pull as he thinks he does!). The cannibal natives are mad (When Vasquez is informed that she is bleeding, she replies, ""I got no time for bleeding"" in her best Jesse Ventura voice) and since the commandos are on their own, they have to make it to the next checkpoint in the jungle, which is easier said than done. Rather than giving you a detailed description of the film's final 30 minutes, I'll just give you the bullet points. See how many you can tie to PREDATOR:
* Romero stabs a scorpion off of Lt. Wilson's back (Sound familiar?).
* Sara tries to escape, but Romero stops her (Elpidia Carrillo did this in John McTiernan's film).
* The cannibals attack and the commandos destroy the jungle forestry with all their gunfire (This actually happened much sooner in McTiernan's film).
* Sgt. Cameron stays behind to keep the cannibals at bay while everyone escapes by jumping off a waterfalls.
* Sgt. Cameron is butchered by the cannibal Chief with a stone knife before he can get away (again, the death is very restrained).
* When they reach the next checkpoint, backup still refuses to come and they all have to make it to the next checkpoint (What is left of them).
* Isias is bitten by a poisonous snake, has his leg amputated, has the stump cauterized with a heated knife, but dies anyway (pretty graphic scene).
* Kruger goes to kill what he thinks is a cannibal, but kills a wild boar instead.
* Sara says she saw two cannibals cut Isias' heart out and eat it before carrying his body away.
* Sgt. Cameron is found hanging skinless from a tree (another graphic scene).
* Vasquez is wounded in a fight and Romero tries to take both women to the checkpoint while the rest fight the cannibals.
* Kruger is killed by a spear and Lt. Wilson has his arm cut off (no weapon in his missing hand, though) before being killed with a spear to his back.
* Vasquez is in too much pain and demands to be left behind and kills a bunch of canninals and herself with some hand grenades.
* Sara gets in the helicopter and is flown away.
* Romero is shot in the back with an arrow, pulls it out and is surrounded by cannibals. Film ends on that note as everyone's face is shown with their real names.
Like I said in the beginning, the gore quotient is very low for a cannibal film (Maybe Mattei spent most of the special makeup effects budget in the first cannibal film), but there is still more gore than in most American-made horror films. The acting is atrocious and Ted Rusoff's voice definitely doesn't match Claudio Morales' looks. And it is filled with dialogue such as, ""It's official. WE'RE ALL F*****!"" Still, it's a helluva lot better than the first film and all the footage (made in the Philippines) is original, unlike Mattei's next film THE TOMB (2004), which is filled with footage ""borrowed"" from some major motion pictures. Intervision Picture Corp. released both of Mattei's 2003 cannibal films on DVD in fullscreen (they released his latter films in their OAR), but they are blemish-free and it really doesn't hurt either film. This film is nothing special when it comes to the cannibal genre, but Mattei was still the only Italian director churning out sleazy films in the New Millennium, so that should count for something. There is plenty of gunfire, explosions, plenty of nudity (none of it titillating, if you'll pardon the pun), a smattering of gore (it is used sparingly, but effectively), lots of natives throwing spears and using blowguns (at least these don't look like white people dressed as natives like in some of the 80's Italian cannibal films) and some spectacular Filipino jungle scenery. I'm sure if Mattei were still alive (he passed away in 2007), he would still be churning out these sort of films. I still think that one of the best films he ever made (and also the sleaziest) was 2006's THE JAIL: THE WOMEN'S HELL, so he still had more stories to tell. There was no one on Earth like Mattei and his passing left a huge hole in sleazy filmmaking that actually entertained.  While all others passed away or just gave up and worked in Italian television, Mattei was still making films that instantly transported us back to the 1980's. And for that we should thank him, no matter how bad or good his films were. Also starring Brad Santana. An Intervision Picture Corp. DVD Release. Not Rated.",1448236800,,10405,4.645686380900705
