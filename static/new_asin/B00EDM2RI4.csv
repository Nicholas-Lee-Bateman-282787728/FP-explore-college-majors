5904707,2,B00EDM2RI4,"It had great potential, but I'm sorry, when a film is badly lip-synced, it throws me off and looses it's magic.

The packaging was great and the back of the DVD sum-up pulls you in. It looks good.

The illustrations for the prologue were great...but that's about all I liked of the movie.

The acting (minus the main witch) was bad. I think of it as a High school play: you can tell who's got talent and who doesn't. The villain was very over-the-top and I found myself wincing whenever he came on screen or laughing out right at his temper tantrums because they were so stupid.

The bear was very fake in film. They put a real bear on the cover.

The voice acting did have emotion, but again, the bad lip-sync threw me off. I couldn't enjoy it.

If they could get a new script and make it a USA film, I'd watch it to give it another chance, but until they do, no.",1384732800,,864,4.174698795180723
5904708,2,B00EDM2RI4,"The script had promise and is actually a 3-star script, but I didn't know it was a foreign film and lip-synced.  I wish I had known that before I bought it.  It was like a B-movie in America.  If you aren't expecting much, this is the film to watch.  The best thing about the film is the cover.  It could have been SO much better!",1384732800,,330,4.015384615384615

5904715,5,B00EDM2RI4,I think this a wonderful movie and I also feel the dubbing is done very well and not a distraction.. I also agree with those who don't understand why anyone would put this movie down. It gives a message ....the kind we need more of today. Actors are great. And story is certainly not the same old same old kind of Christmas movies they make nowadays...I would highly recommend!! And I am far from being a child and I totally loved this story.,1506729600,,442,4.337349397590361

5904721,4,B00EDM2RI4,"""Princess Golden Hair"" is introduced right up top, so it is immediately clear that this will be rife with great character names. This retelling of Norways most famous Christmas tale is delightful, although it would have been much more delightful if I were an eight year old girl. Our young heroine is a disenfranchised orphan-apparent in a sweet beanie who befriends a variety of magical woodland creatures as well as the supremely creepy ""northern wind"" whilst on her - you guessed it - journey to the Christmas star.  Would I recommend this movie to a friend? Yes, especially if that friend has children and/or is cool with watching childrens movies. As evidenced in the credits, Walt Disney Studios Norway distributed this movie- so it has the charm of a Disney flick with some of the campy BS youd expect from weird European folklore.",1479772800,4,838,4.86013986013986

5904724,5,B00EDM2RI4,"This is a wonderfully family friendly Christmas movie. There are just a couple moments of intensity that may be hard for sensitive children to see but all in all it's quite tame. This film is dubbed so the voices don't match what you see on screen but that didn't bother me. I found the sets, coatumes, casting etc all very enjoyable. I highly recommend this film for any family.",1456444800,6,379,4.507246376811594
5904725,5,B00EDM2RI4,This movie is a wonderful family movie. I will watch it over and over again.,1453420800,,76,4.133333333333334

5904727,3,B00EDM2RI4,"Journey to the Christmas Star is a fine, inoffensive holiday film that I'm sure will entertain children. The medieval setting and the costumes are all wonderful. And I have to give credit that it does not shove Christmas down your throat. But like I said, it is with any doubt a kid's movie. Its not very compelling and doesn't have much depth. And the villains are very lame. And of course the English dubbing is so off and very noticeable.

So if you want to show your kids a harmless and simple movie for the Holidays, I think this one is worth at least one watch.",1451606400,,567,4.349056603773585
5904728,5,B00EDM2RI4,"My wife and I found this movie during our annual ""awful Christmas movie search"". Thinking this would be one of them, we really LOVED this movie! We are in our 30's and our daughter is now a toddler, so we both said tonight how excited we are to have her watch this when she is old enough!

Just a fair warning, it is dubbed in English from its original language.",1451001600,,362,4.171428571428572
5904729,5,B00EDM2RI4,"A beautiful story with magic, sadness, joy and hope. The film possesses lovely music and breathtaking settings and scenery.  Rarely is there a film that not only has a great Christmas message but keeps the watchers enthralled not only by the story but the exquisite setting as well.  Be sure you get a version in English.  This is an extraordinary find teaching each journey to love and belief really starts in each heart.",1447891200,2,422,4.7534246575342465
5904730,1,B00EDM2RI4,Unfortunately this blu ray version would not play in my region free DVD player. A special DVD player that plays all DVD's from any region.

5904733,5,B00EDM2RI4,Good movie.  Very good for kids except some of the women's dresses may not be appropriate for boys.  Was amazed at the acting with this movie being made in a different country.  Glad there is no bad language.  It is almost like a fairy tale.  Love how it ends.,1421280000,2,260,4.224489795918367
5904734,5,B00EDM2RI4,"A must see Christmas movie.  It's almost Christmas, but there's no joy in the local village.  It's in perpetual gloom e er since the king cursed the Christmas star.  If the star isn't found soon, it is prophesied that the princess will be lost forever.  Enter,orphan Sinja promises to find the Christmas Star and return it to the kingdom in time to lift the curse.  It's magical filled with evil plotters, enchanted elves, a friendly bear, and Santa Claus himself.",1419984000,2,464,4.75
5904735,3,B00EDM2RI4,"This is a Norwegian filmed dubbed in English and handled by the Disney Company.  Younger children maybe will like the movie as it is a fairy tale of a young girl lost in the woods for ten years and cannot return home unless the Christmas Star is found before the ten years are up and it is up on Christmas Eve.  Two flaws that really stand out are the voice of the young teen witch that sounds like a little child and the fake bear, which really looks fake.  The one on the cover is real, but the one in the film is a very bad fake.  The little girl who plays Sonja is very pretty and plays the role well.  Children may enjoy this, but it may be a strain for adults.",1419120000,4,666,3.9774436090225564

5904739,5,B00EDM2RI4,This is a great movie with a wonderful story. Nowadays we have few family movies in this style (type of Narnia). It is a magical movie with adventure and beautiful message. It is a nice production showing beautiful landscapes. I hope it comes soon in Blue ray format.,1399852800,,267,4.583333333333333
5904740,4,B00EDM2RI4,"This xmas movie is best for winter viewing even though it has St. Nick and uses the words Christmas often (hence the title!).  It has greater potential than it delivers in terms of the way the director uses emotion for the girl and her father (the king).  The discovery of long-lost yet reunited people is a bit weak and underplayed.  It has awesome filmography/scenes and very endearing qualities overall. In conclusion, it is well worth seeing!",1396656000,4,446,4.842105263157895

5904743,5,B00EDM2RI4,"I don't understand the low ratings by some reviewers. This is a ""fantasy"" movie intended for children and the young at heart. It promotes wholesome family values which are obviously politically incorrect for some people. Themes include honesty, generosity, personal-sacrifice, faith, hope and a steadfast spirit. This is the type of movie that American filmmakers have long forgotten how to make. Yes, it's a foreign (Norwegian) production, filmed in Norway and the Czech Republic. The dubbing is very well done and does not distract from the film. The young actress, Vilde Marie Zeiner, who plays Sonja, is a natural who never overacts, and is a cute little kid. There is a good amount of Norwegian cultural elements throughout which I found educational as well as entertaining - the scenes with the Gnomes are a prime example. The music by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra is outstanding!
Don't hesitate to get this film. It's the type of Christmas movie that is heartwarming anytime of the year!  Ignore the naysayers!",1391817600,20,1022,5.119760479041916
5904744,5,B00EDM2RI4,A refreshing change from Disney-style family stories. The scenery and cinematography is beautiful.  My 8-year-old son completely enjoyed this tale.,1389484800,5,147,6.35

5904747,4,B00EDM2RI4,"This moderately budgeted Norwegian film gives kids a mystical tale with lots of fantasy, some cute creatures, and for the adults, lots of  incredible vistas and castles.

2012 release and dubbed in English, the story starts with a king's daughter, Golden Hair,  who vanishes in the forest under a curse.  Her father has 10 years to break the curse by finding the legendary Christmas Star, or the daughter will be lost forever.  Enter the heroine, Sonya, a poor, street urchin who decides to take on the  journey.  She meets many incredible beings and helpers, e.g., tiny gnomes, a talking bear, North Wind, Father Christmas; however, evil forces, a raven witch, attempt to stop her.

Our kids were glued to this intense G rated story, geared towards children's love of magic and fantasy. I found most of the movie very well made; although, as an adult, not always holding my interest.  The dubbing doesn't quite match up, hard to get English to pace with that Norwegian, but it's alright(nothing like those old kung-fu movies we used to laugh over).  Also, being of Norwegian heritage, I wished they would have included the Norwegian version with subtitles.

A fairly short film, it runs about 73 minutes, and there are really no extras.  Mildly stressful situations, but our youngsters(7 & 10) always felt things would work out and really enjoyed this film.  They wanted more of the bear.",1385164800,11,1389,4.884615384615385
5904748,2,B00EDM2RI4,"I had seen this movie before in Norwegian with English subtitles.  At that time, I thought the movie was fun, but it was obviously meant for children.  I purchased this DVD with the idea of using it to practice my Norwegian language skills (I need the help), and I was very disappointed to discover that the DVD had been dubbed in English.  The description of the DVD is not true and it should be changed.",1384992000,3,405,4.373333333333333

We could not find it out on netflix or Amazon this year, so we decided to purchase the story.  It came fast (2 days) and we were enjoying it leading up to Christmas.

8604253,5,B00EDM2RI4,"A different kind of Christmas movie compared to much of what is being offered these days. Not that the others aren't good, but this one stands out with a plot that's not following the standard formula. It's not about a grumpy person learning about Christmas and becoming un-grumpy. I enjoy the formulaic films as well, but I love this one for being unique. It's a fairy tale about a princess on a quest, aided by a gnome and ... well, I'm not going to give away anything else. If you don't like fairy tales or think that they are appropriate only for children, you probably don't understand them and the role they play in various cultures, including ours (Western-European-originated in my case). I can't hold that against anyone, but I hope that at some time you may learn to open your heart to a world of fantasy where our wishes do indeed come true. It's not realistic, but that's part of being a fairy tale--an escape to a world that we'll never experience in our earthly bodies. A wonderful film.",1513987200,,1001,4.566666666666666
