5929999,3,B00EOHGQPI,It was a redemption story that seemed too forced.  They could have done a great more and with more subtlety to get the point across.,1388275200,,132,4.28
5930000,4,B00EOHGQPI,Great remake of a classic tale.  I thought the story line was very good.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was because the acting was not always the greatest.  I understand this was not a big budget movie so it did not bother me that much.  Great story that I could watch with my girls.  Thanks!,1387929600,2,307,4.05

5930005,5,B00EOHGQPI,"Can't get enough Beauty and the Beast?  Then, SunWorld Pictures offers a clean, Dove approved tale with a predictable but well made modern remake of the classic.  And you really get two Beasts in this one.

Isabelle the spoiled orphan, socialite, party girl whose rich uncle provides for her from her deceased parent's trust fund is unlikable even to herself.  She takes a ski trip, insults her not as-glamorous-looking friend and finds herself injured and isolated at the mercy of a mystery man living solo in a romantic cabin far from civilized contact.  Wow, a perfect romance novel.  Of course, the at odds relationship draws us, and we know where this is headed, but it's a relaxing, fun journey to enjoy.

SunWorld produces these kind of movies, e.g., Civil Love(directed also by Bryan Carzan)- a Civil War romance, Scents and Sensibility- a modern Jane Austen romantic comedy and others. The outdoor settings are beautiful, the actors do a fine enough job, although the characterizations and story can be a little overdone at times; the music, editing and general production values are good.

They provide for a genre featuring a simple moral tale with romance, comedy, happy endings, a family friendly film(but little kids will be bored), and a touch of spirituality, e.g., praying or asking God for help or forgiveness. These may not appeal to some for being insipid, moralizing and too predictable.  My opinion: keep making them.  4 stars, 5 because I'm a sap at times for these warm and fuzzy love stories.",1383091200,76,1517,4.937007874015748

Isabelle was a spoil debutante, who only care where the next party was located.  When a skiing accident had her injured in the middle of the wintry forest, Isabelle began to wonder where her life went wrong.  Stumbling along, she found herself at Jeremy's secluded cabin.  Forcing him to help her, she made herself at home.  Jeremy was not happy with the little arrangement and was determined to take this princess down a notch or two.  But their forced closeness began to stir something that they both have forgotten.  Will they discover that love can overcome all before the two weeks were up?

So, what happens when Beauty is the Beast?  You get this movie.  This was not the Beauty we're used to. Instead of being a nice, caring person we've come to expect, our heroine was a spoiled, rich socialite who preferred partying than helping others.  Overall, the acting was done very well.  Not over the top.  Isabelle, played by Shona Kay, was perfectly irritating.  Jeremy, played by Brad Johnson, was majorly cute and I formed more of an affinity with Jeremy's character than Isabella's.  Their chemistry was not off the charts, but enough to make you believe that they were falling in love.  Some of their scenes were giggle-worthy.

The movie basically played out like a romance novel.  It was cliche and predictable.  Which was awesome for me since I love my romances.  However, for those expecting something new, you will be very disappointed.  The plot was a little on the slow side.  As a book, I would've enjoyed it more.  But as a movie, not as much.  Nothing much happened.  For 70% of the time, it was more of Isabella discovering what happiness really meant by secluding herself in this cabin for two weeks with someone who didn't give in to every whim.  I did like the way the movie handled her transformation though.  Overall, it was a clean movie, except for a few kissing scenes.  I'm guessing the Dove.org 12+ seal was probably for some of the mature topics.  However, it wasn't anything you don't normally see on TV these days.  Other than that, there was nothing else I found objectionable.  For the few, there were some Christian elements near the end of the movie.

Beauty and the Beast is and will always be my favorite fairy tale.  ""A Beautiful Beast"" took enough elements from the Disney's version to see the correlation and satisfy fairy tale fans.  If you generally like gentle romances, this is definitely the movie for you.  Mind you, the plot is predictable with a smidge of drama.  And if you are a person who needs something unique and different, please pass this one by.  So, depending on your mood, this will be a movie will be a hit or miss.  Overall, I was excited to watch it once.  However, I think once was enough for me.

I  found the  female lead extremely annoying, self-centered, and rude, and believing she's entitled since her family is wealthy. After awhile, this became tiresome.  Looked for other redeeming qualities in the script, plot, scenery, etc.  With so many really great movies on Amazon Prime, I decided to call it quits after 40 minutes and find something more to my liking.

5930030,3,B00EOHGQPI,"This movie is OK as a TV film. It's a pretty standard romantic movie. The basic storyline is that a rich, out-of-control young woman who is living off a trust gets stranded in the woods in Switzerland and ends up stuck with a reclusive but very decent guy in his house with no phone, no internet, and no car. Over the course of her couple weeks there, she discovers some truths about the guys former life and she begins to change to a more decent person herself. The movie is fairly clean and straightforward. The two biggest problems I had with the film were that first, it was clearly filmed in Canada and not New York and Switzerland. The scenery was great but why not just have the story set in Canada? Second, the girl who played the part of the spoiled rich girl is clearly a fairly decent person in real life. He attempts to seem spoiled and cruel at the beginning of the film caused the acting to seem very bad. As the movie went on and she transformed, her performance became more believable. I would say this movie is watchable but certainly not one of the best I've seen. If you can get past the tacky, bad acting, especially at the beginning, you might enjoy the movie. It's never going to be considered a classic, but it's not horrible either.",1502496000,,1256,4.394849785407725

5930032,4,B00EOHGQPI,"One of the rim-romances I never would have seen without Amazon Prime. I liked this movie from the first watch. It's quirky and obscure, but that's why I like it.

It's believable to a point, but I found myself yelling ""Come on!"" a few times as I watched. Like when she was walking through the snow, lost, she ran through the same spot a couple times. Then there was a car driving by in the background.

I liked that the ""beast"" shoe was on the other foot this time. It's character changes character in this movie and both character were beastly in the beginning. I love movies where the main character has to break through hard challenges to achieve.",1502409600,,650,4.453781512605042

5930034,1,B00EOHGQPI,"It was so bad that I couldn't finish the movie. The script was terrible and full of cliche lines. The leads have no chemistry between them. Also I get that the female character is supposed to be out of touch and clueless but add in the overtly annoying/spoiled brat factor (lazy posture, eye roll, and all) and she is flat out unlikeable.",1501459200,,338,4.467741935483871

5930037,4,B00EOHGQPI,Descent story very good message and good characters. The actors did a good job of conveying their characters. This was not meant for award nominations It was a wholesome movie that the family can watch and had great points to it's main plot. It seemed that it was a Mormon movie given some of the faith themes and where it was filmed and produced. I will recommend this to friends to watch with their families. I know a few who can use the messages! Nice scenery too!,1500940800,,467,4.379310344827586
5930038,5,B00EOHGQPI,"If you a looking for a blockbuster, with a big budget and well known actors, this is not the film for you.

5930040,5,B00EOHGQPI,I really enjoyed this movie.  It was so refreshing to see a movie that so tastefully added prayer as part of the story.  People really are blessed by prayer and it is something the world could use more of.  We all need forgiveness starting with forgiving ourselves.  It was a very positive message and it was inspiring.,1500422400,,319,4.543859649122807
5930041,3,B00EOHGQPI,"This movie was OK - I did watch it all and didn't totally hate it.  This is supposed to be twist on Beauty and the Beast with a Christian tone.  The female lead - Isabelle - had a beastly personality - she was spoiled, rich and horrible to her friends.  The male lead - Jeremy - had demons of his own he was fighting - drug addiction and he's made a terrible choice that caused him his job.  Isabelle ended up getting hurt and lost during a ski vacation and she stumbled on Jeremy's home.  They both disliked one another and had to learn to live together temporarily because there was no phone, internet or car and it would take two and a half weeks for a delivery person to come and take Isabelle back to her resort.

There was praying and talk about God in the movie which is really different.  These two, Isabelle and Jeremy, had to overcome a lot to realize that they could change and be better people and be together.  I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the accent of the female character was bad, really bad and a tad annoying.  I did like the ending and was happy that I watched the entire movie.

Blurb about movie: The classic Beauty and the Beast tale told with a twist! Isabelle is all beauty - on the outside. When she gets lost on a skiing vacation, she is helped by Jeremy, a man hiding from the world and his past. He's the first person to put Isabelle in her place, and Isabelle realizes she might be more beast than she wants to admit. Through Jeremy's influence she begins to change - and fall in love.",1499299200,,1534,4.222602739726027

5930044,1,B00EOHGQPI,If the goal was to write and create flawed characters that were totally unlikable and supposedly normal characters that were useless then goal achieved. The only pro to this film was the cinematography. If the writer and director took out the actors and left nature this would be a much better film.,1498262400,,299,4.769230769230769
5930045,4,B00EOHGQPI,"This is a sweet little macaron of a movie. The cast is well-suited to the story and the production values are good for a film in this class. Yes, the story is predictable, but it is wholesome and charming and poses no shocks or insults to the viewers Central Nervous System. The beauty is a pretty and thoroughly indulged young woman who is very convincing as a petulant, full-grown child who never thinks of others except as they may assist her mostly petty problems. The male lead is handsome and broken and frustrated about everything. The identity surprises are interesting and non-threatening. The biggest inconsistency -- to my mind -- was how she managed to come up with different and perfect make-up every day when she was basically stranded on a mountain with NONE of her belongings! I don't watch a lot of ""abnormal psychology"" material because I think our culture is overrun with it. This is a happy movie! Enjoy!",1497744000,,924,4.745341614906832

5930064,5,B00EOHGQPI,"This movie was better than I had expected; the role of ""Beast"" was shared more by the two main characters through the initial conflict between them than just the woman; both were social outcasts in this case. That may not have been intentional, but it worked. The acting was good enough that she smoothed out in a predictable fashion, and he stopped feeling sorry for himself. The part that didn't help was when someone is left in rugged terrain in winter in late afternoon, you don't just leave them there, fly home, and not tell anyone. That should have been addressed, so it left a big ""hole"" in the plot line that should have been filled. In real life people die in those circumstances.

It ended pretty abruptly and I felt a few details were lacking. The soundtrack also didn't fit the scenes sometimes.

It is good she could even joke about it at the end.

Great scenery, especially out in the wilderness. Acting was OK. The two co-stars were good. Cute story.

When we see how her real story was.....she lost her parents so young. I got a better understanding about why people are the way they are and we can't always hold THEM accountable, because they know no difference!! REALLY...
 This movie also showed what a really good friend was!. A true friend will ALWAYS be there for you, they don't judge you and their NOT afraid to tell you ""their truth"" about ""you"" as ""they see you. I believe people CAN CHANGE FOR THE BETTER!

Beauty and the Beast is reimagined with 2 beasts: a spoiled heiress who blows through her inheritance and a man who seeks isolation to  punish himself for his past. There is a slight religious undertone to the movie, which I appreciate, but I don't think it's overbearing for non-Christians.",1473120000,,546,4.505050505050505

The acting is awful, the script even worse. Not sure how this is supposed to relate to beauty and the beast. There was noting in the content of the movie to suggest so. It's about a bratty spoiled rich girl who constantly puts her friend down and as a result of her horrible behavior gets stranded in the Swiss mountains. She ends up walking to a cottage where a man lives, where she proceeds to demand food and shelter because she's rich. The man could care less and tries to kick her out several times.

5930415,4,B00EOHGQPI,"A cute romance story. The general idea is that the heroine starts out as a very unlikable person, selfish and narcissistic, then she's stranded in the wilderness (sort of) with a stranger who helps her see that she needs to change. Gradually we learn that he has some problems himself. If it's a spoiler to tell you that they fall in love, you haven't watched many movies. I think the heroine started out rather over-the-top obnoxious. I think the story would have been more believable if she had been a little more balanced, but then I suppose there are plenty of real people in the world worse than her.

Side note: The blurb said this was a twist on ""Beauty and the Beast"". I guess the title implies the producers were thinking that, but wow, it's a stretch. Okay, she's stranded at a cabin in the woods with a strange man. I guess that's sort of kind of like being a prisoner. He has some personal problems that she helps him solve. I guess that kind of sort of is like having a curse on him. Etc. Maybe ""inspired by Beauty and the Best"", but I don't think I would have seen any connection if they hadn't told me there was one.

Side note 2: There are some rather vague Christian references, some talk about prayer and forgiveness. If this was intended to be a Christian movie, they are very subtle about it. But as a Christian, I do like a movie that presents Christianity as something positive rather than ridiculing it. I'd love to see more movies that had a ""Christian background"" like this, without necessarily being ""about religion"".",1469923200,,1543,4.507142857142857

It wasn't half bad for a ""christian"" movie, as they usually suck soooo much worse than this did.

5930445,3,B00EOHGQPI,"Not bad if you just wanna watch ""something"". I am not a writer or any professional but I have to say that there was space for a better movie. The plot was nice, the snowy scenes, the fact that it was an isolated cabin in the forest was cool, they could have exploited those good points and make more outside scenes, work more the dialogue between the main characters that could have made the movie more appealing. Maybe another writer can use the plot and give it a little more excitement.",1469577600,,489,4.384615384615385

Is much greatly needed in a world where GOD is forgotten and told HE is not needed or wanted.
And HIS name is used as a curse word here in this movie it was beautifully done and lifted up.
I was totally amazed that this was in a movie this movie reminded me of the beautiful bible stories.
Of LOVE and FORGIVENESS and GOD'S love for mankind and HIS mercy & grace even if we don't deserve it.
I could write about the RICH girl and her attitude and life style of the rich and famous but that not I'm concerned about.
Everyone else has already done that by me reading their views about the movie and the writers & producers.
I'm not that educated enough on that type of thing and to each their own to anyone who not seen this movie please do.
It's wonderfully made and the actors are great in this movie and the out door screens are just beautiful.

I can appreciate and enjoy a good love story. The original Beauty and the Beast novel series and television series were awesome. And still is one of my favorite stories.
To have this movie be compared to it is just sad. The summary of the movie is what drew me in and convinced me to give it a shot. But after watching the first few minutes I was turned off by the lead actress. Bad acting, styling was horrible, she looked like Courtney love in the middle of a bender. I couldn't get past it. Maybe I'm wrong for writing a review since I didn't watch the whole movie.

We watched the first few minutes of the film, moment by moment realizing we had boarded a sinking ship, but when the story line took off to Switzerland for a ski trip, and the hotel turned out to be the Zermatt Resort in Midway, UT (just up the street from us), and the ski trip was for cross country skiing (no disrespect to cross county...but rather a a poke at the idea that tourists travel to the Alps for flatland skiing...not the usual international ski trip to an alpine country). Anyway, wow, it just started slipping downhill fast and furiously. How knows, maybe the film magically got better right after we jumped into the waters of regret and started swimming for shore.

Charming premise. Marginally acted. Little chemistry between characters. Contrived. Supposedly, much of the movie took place in a remote cabin in Switzerland. I suppose the intent was to add credence to the whole poor little rich girl jet setter shtick; it failed. Obviously shot somewhere in Northern California/Colorado, with stock external footage of the Alps.

Dietrick shows up in the morning with the supplies. He's surprised to find no response as he knocks at the door. As he investigates, he looks through the living room window and sees Jeremy with a woman sitting next to him. Dietrick knocks on the window, but there's no response. Finally, sensing something is seriously wrong, he opens the door and walks in. There. Jeremy and Isabelle are staring into each others' eyes, but... they're not breathing. They're cold and stiff - rigor mortis has set in.

Dietrick summons the local constable, who brings the coroner with him. As the coroner investigates the mysterious deaths, he makes a startling discovery: they bored each other to death.",1467504000,3,928,4.79375

5930721,2,B00EOHGQPI,"Beauty and the Beast is a great romance: Strong characters, tortured background, and a sweet opportunity to let love blossom.  Only in this movie, the sweet opportunity is not sweet at all.  Key decisions ruined the romance.

Casting: The actors ages do not match up; the lead actress is too old for 'Belle' against this male lead

Wardrobe: Belle is meant to be a socialite with unlimited budget. Yet, her clothes don't even fit well.

Setting: Although set in Switzerland, the movie is filmed in Idaho and it shows. A trek in the mountains is incredibly different in the Rockies versus the Alps.  The mountain cabin is obviously American.

If you cannot film it, why pretend so horribly?  Write a script where the socialite misspent her youth, cannot fly overseas and must 'settle' for Idaho.

If you put your romance glasses on (and ignore logic) this movie will be enjoyable to any Beauty and the Beast fan.  For me, I could not get passed the compromises. I fell into thinking budget concerns instead of romantic fantasy. Too bad.",1466726400,3,1035,4.764044943820225

5930763,4,B00EOHGQPI,"Cheesy. Predictable. Pretentious. I guess that's the kind of late-night movie I enjoy.

With the feel of a made for TV Hallmark special that the whole family can watch,  this lighthearted film is pleasantly enjoyable. I didn't become grossly involved in character's lives,  nor did I change as a human being because of some value the creators compelled me to grasp. Instead, I just lay back, snuggled under covers, and watched the story unravel, knowing exactly what I'd find around the next corner. Sure, sometimes I thought,  ""Ya, right,""  like when the main character is hobbling around, yet, incredibly, kneels on the floor, sitting on her sprained ankle, but that's okay. Movies of this type aren't made for perfect realism or life changing lessons; they're made simply to enjoy, and that's what I did.

Will the the Beauty change the Beast, or is the Beauty actually the Beast who must change? Uh, yes, I gave it away in my title, but so did the creators. Yes, it's that predictable.

If you're watching in expectation of deeply moving drama, comedy, love story, or other, this isn't it. If you're looking for a clean, foul-language-free, nudity-free, light, silly movie, you will love it!",1466208000,4,1195,4.91542288557214

I am one of those people who likes a good sappy romance once in a while, and I  understand that not everyone has a huge budget to work with ( I assume this film was made for TV)  but even my high tolerance for romantic schlock could not  help me make it through this whole movie.  The wooden acting, the  derivative story line, the ridiculous dialogue that reminded me of the stories I used to write with my friends when I was in the sixth grade  it's just a mess.  I hung in as long as I could, hoping that when the spoiled little rich girl finally met the mountain man who was going to tame her, I would at least like HIM,  but alas, no. I couldn't stick with a film without one likable character to root for.  Come on, we already knew where the storyline was supposed to take us, couldn't someone have made it a fun ride?

5930828,3,B00EOHGQPI,"We were looking for a clean romantic movie. This is a decent redemption/fresh start almost coming-of-age movie. However, we left the movie unconvinced that the budding romance will last and a bit disappointed that an attempt wasn't made to reconcile with the x-wife before pursuing a new relationship. Otherwise certainly more wholesome than many modern romance movies and enjoyable enough to snuggle with one's spouse and laugh over the ridiculous relationship blunders.

The film could have been good with another actress, now if her best friend in the movie could have played the lead part it would have been very credible and she would have done a superb job as she was totally a natural actress. I am sure this lady has other talents but acting is not one of them!  The scenery was lovely, the story a bit cliche but good enough to watch and the leading man a good and credible actor as was everyone else, but I found it hard to endure until the end with this leading lady even when she had a change of heart in the story, her acting got even more embarrassing, I'm sorry but to be perfectly honest and true I could never recommend this movie for that reason.",1446422400,,1072,4.173913043478261

It has a Christian slant, but I found that to be a little strained, almost as if they wanted to market this as a Christian movie so threw in some praying scenes and some Bible reading (in an Asian language? really? what was the point of that?) scenes.  It wasn't like these scenes were very well integrated into the story line, I didn't think.  And how Isabelle went from the ultimate spoiled and moneyed diva who was so full of herself there was room for no one else to a sweet and sensitive girl helping out in a soup kitchen and gently counseling the new love of her life to get him past his past--all within the time it took a sprained ankle to heel, well that was more than a bit unbelievable.

5930891,1,B00EOHGQPI,"I watched this because it was shown in the UK on the newly launched Christian Digital Freeview channel TBN. It broadcasts a Christian film on every Saturday night and the last two have been great; In the Blink of an Eye (2009) from Pure Flix and the classic from the Kendrick brothers Facing the Giants. The Beautiful Beast was shown tonight and I fail to see ANY Christian ethos or content in this film beyond the leading male character Jeremy praying that he might be able to forgive himself for past mistakes so that he could act on his lustful feelings and start a relationship with the lead female character Isabelle. Isabelle seems to 'see the light' when her love interest shows her that she is a selfish socialite. She realises that she wants to date the angry divorced Christian Jeremy because he is actually on reflection charming, is keen to improve his chess game and forces her to bite the bullet and learn how to unload a tumble dryer! Jeremy is not happy with being single but doesn't once pray for reconciliation with his ex-wife or seek any male Christian counsel on his feelings for Isabelle! This is not even the reprehensible flirt and convert strategy since he flirts, talks about God and doesn't care whether she's saved or not or whether spending time alone with a single woman in a shack in the middle of nowhere is a temptation that he is ill prepared for. He seems clueless that being single, lonely, hurt, divorced and sacked from his job for malpractice is a vulnerable situation and one that may lead him to give his heart away to another woman too easily! Instead of investigating the trials of loss, disappointment, coping with divorce etc, this film steers the tried and tested secular western emotional route of follow your heart it must be right! The writer needs to be reminded of Jeremiah 17:9 before writing any other 'Christian' movies. This is 'A Walk to Remember' all over again. It's a film with a 'Christian' character who in no way sets an example of how a Bible believing Christian should prayerfully grapple with the difficulties and disappointments of life. I couldn't recommend this film less. I am sorry I watched it and I am extremely disappointed this was screened on a Christian channel.",1425686400,,2238,4.711734693877551

5930925,4,B00EOHGQPI,"I love films which are loosely based on fairy tales, but after reading some of the mixed reviews I'll admit I was very hesitant about buying this movie.  In the end I decided to give it a go, and I'm so glad I did.  I absolutely love, love, love this movie.  Yes, the character of Isabelle was very annoying at the beginning, but she was meant to be.  She was a spoilt princess who had gotten her own way since the death of her parents when she was a child.  A reviewer said both characters were unlikeable, but I don't think the character of Jeremy was unlikeable.  He was a man hiding from his past who had cherished his solitude for the past 3 years.  When Isabelle suddenly comes barging into his life and home, of course he's not going to be pleasant and charming.  As the movie goes on, the viewers come to understand the reasons behind the behaviour of each character.  Isabelle and Jeremy don't hold anything back from each other, and tell each other how it is exactly from the start.  At first they're both quite rude to each other, but in a way which is quite funny to watch.  In the end both characters force the other to take a long, hard look at their own lives, and what they've been missing.  They bring an honesty to each other's lives, making them realize they're perfect for each other.  Another reviewer said these characters fell in love too quickly, but Isabelle and Jeremy spent two weeks trapped in a house with no television, no phone, no internet, no communication with the outside world - only each other to talk with.  That would certainly bring two people close together.  I can't guarantee whether someone is going to like this movie or not.  All I can say is how much I loved this movie from beginning to end.  Loved the characters.  Loved the storyline.  Loved the dialogue.  It's a movie I will definitely watch over and over again.",1410048000,,1864,4.442477876106195

5930934,4,B00EOHGQPI,"Interesting twist on the classic ""Beauty and the Beast"" story line.  It was surprisingly clean and family-friendly, with no implied sexuality other than *spoiler alert* a kiss in her apartment at the end that may have been just that.  It also has positive themes about following your heart, forgiving past mistakes, and focusing on the important things in life.

5930937,3,B00EOHGQPI,This is a totally cheesy movie that tries to be Christian by having the characters pray a couple of times.  The couple seemed awkward and the build up of feelings and plot wasn't believable or well executed.

5930946,5,B00EOHGQPI,"This was a very good movie with an (obvious) twist on beauty and the beast.  What I really like about it was that it really showed how love isn't just surface, based entirely on looks and perfection.  It really showed the connection between the characters that eventually lead to a fondness better known as ""love"".  Some people might say ""I can't see how they fell in love when they were arguing all the time"" I say, if you watch the movie with a critical eye, you get a chance to see that love is about accepting someone for who they are including their imperfections.  Also before you can love you need to be honest with yourself so the movie had a little bit of self discover as  well.",1403568000,,688,4.34375

5930959,5,B00EOHGQPI,I loved! This movie gives you much to think about. It teaches you that money can not buy you happiness. It also teaches you what it means friendship and love. But above all it teaches you that God is always there in good times and in bad. God always forgives. You have to have it in your heart all the time. I give 100% to this film has an inspiring message.,1399939200,,358,4.056338028169014

5930969,3,B00EOHGQPI,"Worth watching, but a bit slow moving. I felt it took too long for the plot to develop. The moral of the story is good with respect to learning life's lessons about self-absorption, selfishness and growing up out of a life of being spoiled. Yet, its somewhat predictable. In a number of scenes the acting seemed over-the-top. In fact, the best acting comes from those with supporting roles.

5930984,4,B00EOHGQPI,I enjoyed this story of a spoiled young lady following her getting lost in the cold winterland wilderness. Due to conditions she had no control over she learned how to become a civil & sensible young lady @ the hands of a young gentleman who had hoped to escape all connections of the world outside of the wilderness. They both changed & it was a welcomed ending of the story.,1394064000,,376,4.385714285714286
5930985,4,B00EOHGQPI,"Other reviewers have already done a good job describing the plot, so I will merely point out a few specifics not previously mentioned.

While it's natural to view Isabelle as a nasty woman, if you watch closely, you see a nice gal, doing her best to play a gnarly part. Later in the movie, the ""real her"" comes out, and she's very likeable.  She does a good job with her acting; all of the actors here do.

Though Isabelle's skiing trip is set in Switzerland, the movie is filmed in Utah, and aside from one Swiss-style building seen early on, the wooded, rolling-hills landscape in no way resembles the Swiss Alps.  A filming location with rugged mountain peaks would have made the setting more believable.

Jeremy lives the ""simple life"" with no car, Internet, or even a phone, isolated 25 miles from civilization. Yet that doesn't jive with his big, ritzy mountain home (not off-grid, either, but with electricity), chock full of designer furnishings - like many that we see here in America's northwest. A slightly more humble abode (that actually looked like the home of a humble man, not an interior designer), would have added much realism to the plot being depicted. And it would have accentuated the moral that Isabelle came to learn - that the best things in life don't revolve around money.

Jeremy (Brad Johnson) is a talented actor who sure nails his role here.  He's a very handsome guy, and men probably find Isabelle (Shona Kay) equally attractive. This is a wholesome movie that the entire family can appreciate. It's enjoyable to watch each character's individual growth as the story progesses.  It's one that you may find yourself viewing again and again - and feeling good about at the movie's end.",1392940800,14,1717,4.777027027027027

5930988,3,B00EOHGQPI,"This inspirational film has a lot to offer the viewer including a strong story and good actors. In addition it makes the point that money alone does not bring happiness but caring about others is what it is all about.

The character of Isabelle Elliott (Shona Kay) is the perfect example of a spoiled rich girl who is now an adult. Her rich uncle spoiled her but the trustees of her will are encouraging him to cut her off until she shows some maturity. When she spontaneously flies to Switzerland with her friend Catherine (Melanie Gardner) she goes skiing and then following an argument sends Catherine away from the snowy place they are at.

Isabelle falls, hurts herself, and wanders off before becoming lost. She stumbles upon a cabin and a man named Jeremy (Brad Johnson). She insists he helps her and against his wishes he does, feeling some compassion for her. They clash immediately and he calls her self-centered.

She is used to people catering to her every whim and Jeremy is unlike anyone she has ever met. Conversely, he is hiding from his past, which features a medical tragedy, and she helps him face up to it. These 2 oddballs find they have more in common than they initially thought and the romantic question becomes if they will become a couple and, even more appropriately, a couple that has a future together.

We are awarding this terrific movie which features forgiveness five Doves, our best rating. We are recommending it for ages twelve plus. This is a good one for couples to watch together. It makes the point very well that no man is an island and that one person can greatly influence another person's life.",1391731200,,1638,4.677083333333333

After being abandoned by her friend in the Swiss alps, she's lucky enough to stumble upon Jeremy's mountain cabin where he has been hiding from the world and his past. The two week encounter while Isabelle waited for transportation ended up being just what the doctor ordered for both of them.
