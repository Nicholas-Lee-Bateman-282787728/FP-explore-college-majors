747770,5,630396835X,"I had the pleasure to view this film on wide-screen at the Houston Museum  of Fine Arts cinema venue back around 1996 or so. It was utterly  breathtaking...and a special treat for me since I also speak Spanish and  Russian as foreign languages (I for one, didn't mind the subtle Russian  dubbing following the sentences in Spanish & English).  I notice  most of the reviewers comment on it's role as a ""communist propoganda  film"".  Yes, well, the film tries hard to follow the ""Socialist  Realist"" of 'official' Soviet Art, but it (thankfully utterly) fails  to do so and slides breathlessly into a ""Magical Realist"" mode  with elements that Soviet critics would have disdained as  ""metaphysical"".  Indeed, the remarkable thing is that this film  was BANNED in the USSR *and* CUBA shortly after its release.  Didn't sit  well with the Politburo, etc.  The cinematography is wonderful.  Yes, it  is critical of the Norteamericanos, but the film does not demonize them.  Think of the scene w/ the American sailors...I was anticipating a fight and  a violent rape...but it doesn't happen.  The film could have been much  harsher on the US than it was.  I may very well buy this film on VHS.  I'm happy to see it available for rent at my local Blockbuster's.",969321600,36,1255,4.806603773584905
747771,5,630396835X,"I was a twenty-something and living in La Habana when this film was made. It did not do good business in La Habana or anywhere else on the island because we knew it to be a lie. As a joke we referred to it as ""I AM  Not Cuba"" (although we never dared to joke publicly). I remember it  was even a source of embarassment to some of my school friends who had  joined the party for advancement and worked at the Ministry of Education,  assigned to promote the film.
Having said this, I want to state that the  picture is certainly a marvel of cinematography and direction. It is  genuinely beautiful and graceful cinema. If you do not mind that it is all  one big lie, (and I suspect that most who will see it, don't  mind one bit)  it will be of much enjoyment. Is beauty still beautiful when at the service  of evil? Apparently yes.
For those who enjoy world cinema and Soviet  cinema in particular, I can also recommend SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS  by the great Sergei Paradjanov. Coincidentally made around the same time,  poor Paradjanov was even still more beautiful but did not lie. He was  sentenced to prison and served hard labor as a consequence.",960854400,20,1156,4.4170616113744074

747774,5,630396835X,"Kalatozov's I Am Cuba is a cinematic achievement, one of the century's landmark films, despite that it is relatively unknown. Although the film stands as a hymn exalting Castro's Revolution in Cuba, I Am Cuba transcends  its narrative into an artistic tour de force, deftly combining and  distilling cinematic styles of the era. Threading together elements of  Italian neo-realism, French New Wave, and even Fellini's gravity-defying  lens of modernity in the vein of La Dolce Vita and Nights of Cabiria,  Kalatozov creates a lush and passionate vision so rarely seen in cinema. I  Am Cuba, if seen on the big screen, is breath-taking: from the opening  title sequence featuring an aerial shot of the island's palms wafting in a  tropical breeze, to the closing drama of the mountain guerrillas fighting  with verve for a united cause. It is truly a triumphant accomplishment!",930873600,6,876,5.112676056338028
747775,5,630396835X,"VIVA LA REVOLUCION!  So close to America, so far away from Mother Russia, I AM CUBA attempts to capture the essence of the communistic brother-other of the island nation.  Set in the bad old days of the Batista regime, this  amazing artifact of the Cold War follows four narrative vignettes dealing  with the events that led to the 1963 revolution. The movie was supposed to  be a paean to Fidel and 'la revolucion,' but one suspects that its true  subject is the camera as it madly spins and spins and romances the Cuban  landscape with how-did-they-did-that long takes.  The film is a direct  descendant of Eisenstein's QUE VIVA MEXICO, in terms of exoticizing a  distant foreign land through the movies.  This time around however, the  director Kalazatov, cinematographer Urusevsky, and the poet Yevtushenko are  the Soviet men with a movie camera.  Both Kalazatov and Urusevsky are no  amateurs.  They were responsible for the acclaimed THE CRANES ARE FLYING.  Yet one can't help but wonder what went wrong as this relentlessly visual  documentary appears to undercut its ideological thesis by a long take or  any number of camera acrobatics.  'Dios mio,' I AM CUBA remains to be seen  to be believed!  It is a deliriously inventive documentary that blurs the  line between propaganda and art, with history repeating in the eye of the  camera.  VIVA EL CINEMA!",924998400,10,1364,4.929203539823009

747920,5,630396835X,"Besides a very satisfactory scan of the original film, ""Soy Cuba"", the background material contained together in the box and within ""The Soviet Mammoth""- the making of ""I am Cuba"" shot by a Brazilian Documentary team, is probably the BEST purchase I have made from AMAZON all year!!!!

In fact, ""I am Cuba"" is a Film Student's Must See for its stunning cinematography and its impact on telling the story. There are incredible, noteworthy interviews with participants in the original production, and excellent documentation of how the film was created.

Another reveling theme further describes of what otherwise would have been a crumpling mass of celluloid. It was instead, rescued by determined American Archivists and brought to the world's attention by the likes of Coppola and Scorsese, acclaimed as an outstanding piece of cinema graphic art... This, a formerly rejected and permanently shelved FAILED SOVIET PROPAGANDA FILM.... Imagine my delight to have recently visited characters that are in the documentary during my recent visit to CUBA, which brought the whole experience to life and validated the credibility of the documentary.

748011,3,630396835X,"Mikhail Kalatozov's 1964 film, I Am Cuba (Soy Cuba) is probably the most divergent film I've ever watched in terms of the quality of its constituent parts. It is, as its reputation boasts, visually stunning, imaginative, innovative, and flat out great. But, in terms of its narrative, it is hackneyed, trite, and unimaginatively anti-American in its blatant agitprop, and laughably bad. And I say this fully aware of the Ugly Americanism that has wrought the communist fervor that still grips South America, as well as the Islamic Extremism, because the propagandizing in the film has a seriously negative effect on the film, to the point that its labeling as `Commie kitsch,' by many of its detractors, and even some of its champions, is dead on.

  The film was a joint Soviet-Cuban production, meant as blatant propaganda for the Communist cause, but Kalatozov's film so rhapsodized Cuban sexuality and reveled so in its visuals, that even its backers as Mosfilms, the Soviet State film company, pulled it after a short distribution period. It was critically denounced both in Cuba and the Soviet Union. It was not until filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Francs Ford Coppola saw and championed it in 1995 that the film got its first taste of critical success in the West. The film was written by Enrique Pineda Barnet and Russian state poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and the cinematography by Sergey Urusevsky, as mentioned, deserves all the plaudits it can muster. The acting is passable, at best, and wooden, stilted, and forced, most of the time. The film was shot in black and white, and used using color filters to exaggerate contrast, as well as using wide angle shots in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The film's music is diegetic and not, but the one aspect of the film that is neither good not bad, overall; although in certain scenes the singing and music are wonderfully evocative of time and place.",1339027200,7,1896,4.91875
748012,3,630396835X,"The style and production of the video are beautiful and it is a classic. I was enjoying it very much until towards the end, the inevitable happened and the good hearted peasant took up a gun and left his family to go and join in the fighting... and from then on it was just a propaganda war film",1289260800,2,295,4.103448275862069
748013,3,630396835X,"For the movie made over 40 years ago, Soy Cuba/I Am Cuba/Ya Kuba, is innovative and very beautiful. I won't be original to mention at least two long scenes in the film that are absolutely brilliant and can be enjoyed on their own over and over again. Besides, these scenes don't have triple narration, just the music that makes them even more impressive. Speaking of the languages presentation, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. The film is presented with English subtitles, spoken English and Spanish, and Russian voice over which is very annoying. Even though Russian is my native tongue, I looked for the option to turn off the narration but unsuccessfully. With all these voices and subtitles that won't go, you are distracted from the visual beauty of the film which is its best value.  I suggest, you go on YouTube, find the rooftop scene and the funeral procession, and watch them in awe, be amazed and fascinated. That's basically all I have to say about Soy Cuba, the propaganda film that was made in 1964 during the victorious days of Fidel Castro Revolution and high hopes for new happy life for the hard working citizens of the Caribbean Paradise Island. Ironically, the film ""I Am Cuba"", as anti-American propaganda as they ever come, made as a Cuban-Soviet co-production, was not widely released in either pro-Communist country and was almost forgotten until it was restored and presented in the USA in the middle of the 90s by two celebrated American Film Directors, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola.

Of course, I am impressed by its brilliant cinematography, and who would not? I am not going to describe the beautiful insanity of Sergey Urusevskij's camera in the opening scene of the film or its free soar in the funeral procession later into the picture. It's been done hundreds of times already. If you need an explanation on how these impossible camera movements were achieved, go to Soy Cuba Wikipedia page - they have a thorough and detailed description of the shooting process and how it was done.  But let me tell you something. If you really want to see a great Soviet film made by the same Director-Cinematographer team, the wonderful, engaging, fascinating, ahead of its time yet truthfully depicting the tragic events of the history FILM, with the shots that are included in the text books, with the poignant touching story, with the real characters that you never forget, watch Mikhail Kalatozov's B/W film ""Cranes are flying"" which he and his genius cinematographer Sergei Urusevskij made in 1957. Cranes Are Flying has never become outdated and never will. It will stay unforgettable and compelling as well as cinematographically perfect as long as the Art of Cinema lives. Cranes are Flying is timeless. Soy Cuba is a product of certain time period and its politics. It is not even the problem that the film is a shameless propaganda. The propaganda can be powerful and artistic. Watch for example ten minutes long animated film of Jan Svankmajer ""The End of Stalinism in Bohemia"".  One of the reviewers on IMDB site is asking ""How did they dare to make such a film in 1963?"" I guess the answer is that by 1963 the short period in the history of the USSR which is known as ""thaw"" or ""ottepel'"" that began after Stalin's death in 1953, was over. The 60s represented the return to the Stalinism aesthetics even if officially it had never been admitted. It would take another quarter of the century until the truth about some events and politics was finally told during the ""perestroika"" in the late 1980s and after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. IMO, Soy Cuba is overall a weak film with very creative virtuoso cinematography. I suppose that the Film Students will learn a lot from its technical values but it is a film with the parts much better than the whole thing.

748014,5,630396835X,"The doc accompanying the restored film is really terrific.  In it, it was great to see contemporary Cuba's reaction to the film and also the participants and how they'd aged.  I like the docs a bit more than the film but there is not denying the incredible power of the 'poetic' soviet style on display here.  The camerawork, as everyone mentions, is often incredible - simply fantastic.  The lighting design is evocative and provocative.  What lingers, ultimately, for me, is the least appreciated aspect of the film:  the story.  Seeing 'Americans' depicted thru a soviet prism in a film about the Cuban revolution was quite arresting.  While the price for this boxed set is fairly steep, given the somewhat obscure nature of this film (and supporting documentaries,) I'd have to say it's worth it.  A unique film and film experience.  Whew, I want to see more 'soviet realism' if it's up to these visual standards.",1220659200,3,917,4.858064516129033

As another reviewer noted, the three DVD's are encased in wafer-thin snapcases which will not hold the DVD's in place securely. Thus, during shipment, some or all--as has been my experience twice!--will become unattached and the playing surfaces will be very badly scratched. As the eye-catching box is huge, it begs the question as to why regular snapcases weren't used. They would fit.

The problem is one that happens far too often with DVD's. The discs are falling off the spindles and getting scratched as a result (there are, by the way, similar problems with the Criterion Eclipse discs which have the same packaging: I have ordered most of the Eclipse packages; half of them have arrived with discs that have come off the spindles and been damaged in the process). I would put Milestone's I am Cuba packaging up there with the awful fold out Buffy and Angel Fox sets, Warners dreadful The Waltons season sets, and the truly wretched MGM Stargate SG1 box set.

The problems with the packaging of Milestone's I am Cuba (others here have noted similar problems putting to rest the pathetic and spurious intimations that I have something against Milestone) are unfortunate since I am Cuba is a brilliant film and along with Cranes Are Flying prefigures much of the French nouvelle vague.

By the way, there is an alternative: I ended up purchasing the Mr. Bongos region 2 I am Cuba two disc set from Amazon.co.uk (yet another reason to own an all-region DVD player). It arrived undamaged.

Swooping over sugar fields, through dense forests and urban milieu of both the decadent and militant variety, Kalatozov portrays the beauty of Cuba and its people via a quartet of loose, dreamy, near-wordless stories--all set to the beat of pulsing Afro-Cuban music.",1182902400,,504,5.558441558441558
748105,5,630396835X,"""I Am Cuba"" is one of those rare film gems that is discovered after spending years in a vault, the dust is blown off and the movie lives again as a glorious spectacle. Mikhail Kalatozov's vibrant portrait of pre-Castro Cuba is a stunning experience of sight and sound, with breathtaking vistas of the gorgeous island as the backdrop to human stories of love, suffering and revolution. Presented by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, it's one of those special films that always feels alive and never slow. It pulsates with music and passion as we see the decadent Havana under the U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship as gangsters run the clubs and American tourists show-up to enjoy the sun and girls as Cuba's people live in poverty and racism runs rampant. In the Sierra Maestra Fidel Castro and his band of rebels fight the dictatorship while in the city and towns we meet fascinating individuals: A fruit seller in love with a woman forced into prostitution, a poor farmer with two children who suffer under the yoke of an evil landowner who has sold their sugar cane crops to the United Fruit Company (which left a trail of poverty and suckled resources in Guatemala and Colombia as well). ""I Am Cuba"" tells these stories with furious energy and gorgeous photography. There are amazing moments of pure cinematography as the camera enters and follows, flies and dives (one famous scene follows a tourist swimmer into a lavish hotel swimming pool, a shot later copied in ""Boogie Nights""). Oh sure Communist haters and anti-Castro activists will bash this as propaganda, but it is a glorious, exciting movie and the history of Cuba cannot be denied. Fans of classic films will enjoy this as well as cinematography students looking for interesting, vibrant work to check out.

748106,5,630396835X,"This is easily one of my favorite films but the DVD has its problems. The biggest complaint I have is the Russian dubbing: 1) There are times when an actor speaks in English but what is said is inaudible because the lines are overlapped by Russian and left without subtitles 2) It's distracting and sometimes obscures the inflection of the actor's voice 3) If you happen to understand Spanish you can't watch it in its original language. Unfortunately, I can't find a non-dubbed version yet, though it is rumoured to exist.

On the propaganda note: what does it matter if this is or is not propoganda? I agree, it does show one side, a favourable view of Castro and the revolution, but so what? Don't many films do that? Are all films a fair and balanced depiction of anything? Does this affect the quality of the direction, cinematography, acting? Besides, we all have heard the anti-Castro story but here is the other side of the argument which obviously had to exist or else the revolution would never have come to pass in the first place. These stories highlight some of the reasons why most of the citizens of Cuba wanted a change and how, in contrast to the government at the time, Castro seemed like a good idea -something that people today may not understand. One more thing, I am from one of those ""white elitist Cuban"" families referred to by another poster and I have I heard a ton of glorious ""old Cuba"" stories, and through them I have surmised that Cuba was wonderful only to a select few while being indescribably oppressive to a vast majority. All in all, issues are rarely ever black and white, propagandists want you to think they are so I suppose the best advice I can offer is go through life with your thinking cap on and you'll form your own opinions ;0)",1157068800,4,1776,4.55
748107,4,630396835X,"With Fidel Castro currently in a precarious medical condition, this infamous 1964 film, later revered by film scholars like Martin Scorsese for its often breathtaking camerawork by Sergei Urusevsky, takes on a most interesting relevance now. As much as Leni Reifenstahl glorified the Third Reich in 1935's seminal ""Triumph of the Will"", Russian director Mikheil Kalatozishvili goes the same route with this joint 1964 Soviet-Cuban production which has been designed completely as a pro-Castro tribute. Political controversies aside, what continues to fascinate about both films is how audaciously cinematic they are in their own ways.

In Kalatozishvili's case, he uses off-kilter camera angles and naturalistic, documentary-like techniques in rich monochromatic black-and-white to bring to life four vignettes about post-revolution Cuba. Made in the throes of the Cuban Missile Crisis to prove to the world how Cuba has prospered, the film does evince a sense of dynamic liberation about the people, but it is not entirely successful in supporting the political causes it espouses. At times, the director can get somewhat didactic in his approach, especially in the unsurprisingly negative portrayals of the Americans. Make no mistake that this is a propaganda film. The stories focus on a prostitute in Havana who is abused by her wealthy American client, a farmer who decides to burn off his sugar cane fields rather than hand them over to a greedy landowner, a group of students who fight the police in the name of the revolution, and a peasant family who perilously joins the guerrilla forces in the hills.

Starting with the use of a female voiceover as Cuba, the movie has some innovative elements that range from boldly symbolic to emphatically bizarre. The most famous is at the beginning, a long, uninterrupted tracking shot that starts with a beauty pageant on a hotel rooftop and then descends five floors to a poolside party below where the camera isolates a woman entering into the pool. Another is a massive funeral procession shot from overhead. The soundtrack is quite eclectic with native Afro-Cuban rhythms alternating with almost Coplandesque musical passages and he natural sounds of Cuban life. Sometimes the filmmaker's panache gets carried away with itself, especially when the vaunted execution of Marxist principles becomes intertwined with the majestic power of nature. Non-actors certainly add to the documentary flavor. It's an intriguing film well captured in a pristine print transfer on the 2000 DVD, but despite its originality, it runs rather too long at 141 minutes. The only other extra on the DVD is the 1995 re-release theatrical trailer.",1155168000,,2676,5.308962264150943
748198,5,630396835X,"This review may be construed as containing spoilers. But they are mild ones, because while I will be hinting at specifics of content, I do not aim to steal the thunder of the films makers. I think the episodes of this film that you'll want to keep -- and which I doubt you'll be able to get off your mind in any event -- are the middle two.

The first and last episode feel somewhat like preachments, whether or not one agrees with them (and they do enlist your sympathy as well as they could, setting politics aside, for being so well made). The first episode is marred by an unconvincing, stereotyped portrayal of the tourists. This is the most awkward epsiode of the four, and that's a little sad because the core story it tells -- of a good woman reduced to the practice of the oldest profession in order to survive -- is credible and involving. Awkward moments or no, episode 1 is shot with a genius eye, and movingly acted in part. The female lead is good. So are the unprofessional ""faces"" that fill out the background. And the ending is just the right finish for the piece -- tense and sobering.

The last story hooks you and holds you for a good while with the story of a rural mountain family held in primal struggle with survival. But at fade out of this interlude, the escalating giddiness of the episode climaxes in shots of comrades with their arms locked around each other's shoulders, enveloped in the poetic swirl of the smoke of battle, waving flags and swelling Russian patriotic music. It is hard to see this sort of scene at this point and not think of a tv commercial (with its over-the-top foreshortening into ""big moments"") or outright parody. Still, one hesitates to dismiss the episode because for the first half its length, it is engrossing, and you do become deeply involved in and care about the proceedings.

Now, to the perfect parts of I Am Cuba. The second story, the one about the old-before-his-time sugar cane planter, plays like a short story from William Faulkner. It's not overstating it to say that this is crafted from the purest material of the human spirit. It leaves volumes unspoken between the lines of it's visually lush yet expeditious narrative. I don't want to spoil it for you, so I won't give too much away. But I will alert you to watch for the telescoping of the farmer's young life into an impressionistic collage early in the episode. It's brilliant.

The third episode relates the vascillations of a revolutionary youth perhaps too burdened with conscience for what he is about, and the consequence of his hesitation, with the utterly devastating irony of de Maupassant. I have never seen the lead actor here in anything else, but he is perfect in this. Great casting. As a true antihero, a man whose courage fails him at a critical moment, he feels like the genuine article. The episode dovetails into something patriotic and somewhat overblown, but what goes before that ending is nothing short of great film making. Deeply felt. Insightful. Indelible.

The thing that sold me on I Am Cuba is the fact that Cranes Are Flying, by the same director, Kalatozov, is one of my favorite films. In that film, too, Kalatozov gambles with going too far for the chance of tapping into huge, operatic feeling. I think it works. It is an emotionally overwrought and somewhat sentimental approach. But one accepts the approach because you sense that Kalatozov believed in it himself, and hadn't been prodded by someone else, with a more mercenary eye, to turn on the waterworks. Kalatozov is often compared in some way to Eisenstein. In terms of material, especially, I suppose this is apt. But to me, a more apt comparison might be to Frank Capra. If you aren't completely on board with this director, he may seem emotionally manipulative or cornball to you. If you are, you'll be swabbing away the tears a few times during his films, at moments of filmed life that you'll never forget.

According to the film, Cuba is the impoverished in the city, the farmer in the sugarcane field, the student in the University, and the resister in the mountains.

There are glimpses of propaganda like implying that Lenin's ""The State and Revolution"" was a source of inspiration for the resistance movement but according to outside sources, strong ties to communism came after 1959 and was not the initial objective of the revolution. However, the biases of the film are relatively inconsequential due to the great experience of actually seeing the Cuban landscape and people, which is something that historical documents will never be able to compete with.

When you say you know nothing about Cuba's history, and then dismiss ""I Am Cuba"" as propaganda, you are displaying both your own ignorance and the success of the American propaganda machine in conditioning Americans to accept simplistic answers to complex questions.

""I Am Cuba"" is a beautiful film, and makes no attempt to portray itself as even-handed. The assumption is that we already know what the white Cuban elite wants us to know. This is explicitly the story of those the elite would prefer to pretend do not exist.

Having lived overseas, I'm sorry to say the grotesque images of American businessmen and the arrogant debauchery of sailors on leave in a 3rd World country are depressingly accurate, especially for the time depicted. And exactly whom do we think is fueling the international child sex trade today, if not wealthy Americans ""on vacation""?

Cuba and the USA have a long and tortured history. Cuba's white elite sought to atrtach Cuba to the US prior to our Civil War, so as to perpetuate slavery on their sugar plantations. That same elite allowed the US to assume control over Cuba after the Spanish-American War, when the Platt Ammendment gave the US government extraordinary control over Cuba's internal politics as well as foriegn policy. No good could come of all those ""coloreds"" having democracy, certainly not a few nautical miles away from our ""coloreds""! Later, we changed our minds: the problem with the poor isn't that they're black, it's that they're Communist sympathizers. We trained Batista, kept him in power, and with American corporate investment Cuba became essentially a sick amalgam of plantation and whore-house, with a monsterous gap between the mainly white elite and the rest of the population.

The one ""sympathetic"" businessman debauches the young taxi-dancer, and then wants to buy her one treasured posession. A clear if obvious metaphor for the ""good intentions"" of Americans who are as oblivious to the realities of the world as that guy was on his way to her shack. On the way out, it's a lot clearer.

Cuba is a flawed country today, but one where everyone has access to education and healthcare, two issues raised specifically in ""I Am Cuba"". Whatever happens in the future, it is difficult to imagine the disgruntled elites camped out in Miami being welcomed back to their nightclubs and haciendas any time soon. ""I AM Cuba"" makes a simple point: the Cuban exiles in Miami are NOT Cuba; in the truest sense, they never really were, and they certainly never will be again.",1140393600,63,2620,4.943181818181818
748203,2,630396835X,"I must admit, this is my first experience with a Russian propaganda film.  Honestly, I didn't know what to expect.  Willing and able, I was ready to be bored to death with trivial political matters, textbook filmmaking, and passionless stories.  As the film closed, I did witness some of the aspects that I was expecting.  The stories needed to be further developed and the politics of Cuba needed to be explained instead of countering with the mythological island conveying its heartfelt feelings ... yet there was something compelling about this film.  The cinematography was brilliant.  From the opening sweeping scene of the island to the dramatic walk through the streets of Cuba, I was captivated by the beauty that filmmaker Mikheil Kalatozishvili chose to explore while making this film.  Without caring about the stories, you could easily be swept away by the sheer enjoyment of the camera work with this film.  Kalatozishvili was that impressive.  He reminded me of a mix between Jarmusch and Lynch and a sprinkle of Stone (Oliver that is).

Soy Cuba was like watching a one sided debate, which works when creating a propaganda film.  I know very little about the history of Cuba, or the regime in place prior to Castro, but I needed to see more of that in this film.  I needed a bit of history, a little less overly played drama, and more ""true"" stories.  If this is a Moore-like propaganda film, I have no doubt that Russia could pull true stories from the people of Cuba and recreate those instances.  I do believe that what we witnessed were somewhat true, but overly exaggerated.  If prostitution was an understandable and common, not respected, form of employment, than why would the ""boyfriend"" be upset?  If sugar was such a priceless commodity, why didn't the landowner take that before selling the property?  If the Cuban police force was that corrupt, would you feel that these students would have a secondary plan in place?  Finally, the peaceful villager who wants to fight to end the war seemed a bit too bold to be honest.  There just seemed to be a sense of drama surrounding these stories.  Again, I suppose that you need them to create a true propaganda film, but would you not agree that a debater discussing the horrors of abortion by just telling stories after stories would not fully convey the point without some moments of history.  In Soy Cuba, there needed to be more of these points.  There needed to be facts, there needed to be honesty, and there needed to be a stronger divide between drama and truth.  I believe that what Cuba was experiencing was terrifying, but I needed stronger evidence to support it.  From an outside viewer looking in, I wanted to be persuaded.  By the end of this film, I was not.

I am a stern believer in skipping the special features of a DVD because those should not sell me on the film.  It should be the film itself that is good, not necessarily the quality of the excess features.  In past reviews, I have not mentioned the quality of the DVD because I want to have the film speak for itself.  For Soy Cuba, I will break from this tradition, but just this once.  The quality of this DVD is poor.  I am not speaking of the transfer from film to DVD (which is not half bad), but it is the choice to use both Russian and Spanish dubbing with English subtitles throughout the entire film.  I found no way to turn this off.  Whenever a character had to speak in Spanish, we were bombarded with both the subtitles and the Russian dub over the voice.  After the first fifteen minutes, this became extremely annoying.  In fact, it takes away from the strength of the film.  By the end of the two hours, you are either confused because you couldn't catch everything the characters were speaking, or you have a headache from trying to keep it.  It was embarrassing.

One cannot finish a review of this film without again stating the strength of the cinematography.  Very few films seem to capture the beauty of a land, no matter if it is being torn apart by a government, or getting ready for a Russian rule.  Soy Cuba accomplished the impossible and gave this beautiful island the cinematography it deserved.  I mentioned before the sweeping opening shot, but the infamous ""top of the hotel to the pool shot"" kept me breathless.  It was so impressive to the craftsmanship of the camera come into play with this film.  You could tell there was heart and passion behind the camera, I just only wish there was more demonstration of that passion in front of the camera.

Overall, the cinematography cannot stand alone.  I thought long and hard about this film, and while I thought that Cuba was beautifully captured on film, the stories themselves did not stand up well over time.  I also had major concerns about the lack of dedication to the DVD.  The horrendous dubbing and painful translation was enough to churn the strongest of stomachs.  With all of these points going against it, I do not think it is a film I could sit through again. There is a scene in the film where a man is boating down the river dodging your typical ""rivery"" obstacles, slowly taking his time as our ""island"" narrates some truths that are unknown.  This scene best summarizes this film.  Soy Cuba was slow, overly dramatic, and avoiding as many obstacles as possible that would have transformed this film into a stronger film.  The only plus I can give it is the cinematography.  Those interested in filming film need to see this movie, otherwise a National Geographic special would do better.

748205,5,630396835X,"Many reviewers here want to somehow recognize the technical and even artistic quality of this film while calling it ""totalitarian garbage"", thereby preserving their hep cat credentials.

This is self-contradictory, for I Am Cuba neatly deconstructs the claim that Socialists can't make a case for Socialism or make entertaining films.

Sure, Socialists can't make comedy. We have The Three Stooges but it appears that at best the Russians have The Five Stupid Guys Without Culture, perhaps because capitalism, which has the arguable virtue of so diffusing oppression that it becomes a background noise, issuing not in labor camps but in the everyday, generates the very ability to laugh it off. Whereas socialismus, it has to be admitted, generates darkness in concentrated lumps.

However, I Am Cuba translates an argument for an actually existing socialism into a good story.

As a 56 year old American I found the characterizations of the nightclubbing Americans painfully accurate renditions of the sort of man who circa 1959 was sent by his company to do business in Havana. Far from being a cardboard characterization, the film takes pains to recognize that even within a small group there will be differences and macho pressures to ""enjoy the fun"" of a mobbed up Havana on members of the ""team"".

As we see in the film, the boozed up and mobbed up will force together the Quiet American and the sad girl and there will be a moment, between the quiet man and sad girl of recognition, which turns into her knowledge that he will fail to follow through.

That's why we follow the Quiet American, coded accurately as such by his late Fifties hipster beard, to the *favela* and realize that this might be one Yanqui who might Listen, maybe if the homes whacked him upside the head, which they don't.

It may have been illogical for an Anglo Texan, C. Wright Mills, to write Listen, Yankee, a book which identified the failure of recognition in America's insistence that Cuba needed to preserve a mobbed-up free market, since by the ""law"" of comparative advantage, Cubans were best at shaking their thang for gangstas, and did not need an education or health care to do so.

But it was no more logical for a New England Yankee family to move to Texas and claim to be trueblue American cowboys thereby, and able to speak for struggling ""real"" Americans.

But over time it became impossible for a Norteamericano to empathize with Cuba, or Nicaragua, to the degree where he might realize that America is one continent and that most folks on it are just struggling to get by...to the degree where a New England yankee might start rolling his Rs instead of lying with a smirk and a drawl.

I Am Cuba has a shot at restoring this ability over time, for I can well imagine guys on oil rigs or fishing boats watching this film with approval; my experience is that the socialist message is received but that American media, systematically, fails to amplify it.

In sociology, methodological individualism makes nameless the phenomenon of a guy on an oil rig having a socialist epiphany but being literally unable to speak about it without translating it to a nihilistic grunt easily fed into the hopper of a manufactured consent, as fungible as the oil for which he drills. Io son Cuba is just a start.

The next sequence of the film, after the nighclub and *favela* gets to The Heart of the Matter which is you work like a dog cutting cane (one of the most difficult jobs on earth) on land you think you own only to be expropriated. This raises the question as to whether post-revolutionary repression can be justified by slow-motion expropriation...right down to the last uncashable paycheck.

Sure, Fidelismo is repressive. In a patriarchal socialism you know where to lay the blame.

You have Beard Papa, for even as Shakespeare's Henry V complained, we need somewhere to lay our burden down, our careful wives and children rawly left. The American CIA cynically exploits the family romance as seen most poignantly in the Elian Gonzales case, which the CIA lost. Didn't it.

In a mobbed-up Havana the executioner's face is well hid. The girls, dancing parodies of ancient dances in African masks to show off their body, are Adorno's puppet show in which enjoyment is killed once you know why the show must go on, and the rictus of desparation behind the mask.

I recommend that Americans including Americans dispossessed by hurricanes or Walmart, living on their brother's couch, check this baby out. If even Warren Buffett can admit that owing to permanent tax cuts restricted by an ""alternative minimum tax"" to the upper class, excluding even the *haute* bourgeois, America is becoming a sharecropper society, most Americans should be curious about what life might be like for them in a Havanized Miami, and what the alternative might be.

I also recommend a Taschen book on contemporary Cubano style, because it contains photographs of apartments today in Havana.

The apartments are by the standards of the American *haute* bourgeois complete dumps but they have loads of books in what is supposed to be a ""totalitarian"" state, whereas the apartments of the rich and famous in Architectural Digest have DVDs and CDs but no books.

The high technical quality of this film made it marketable in America. Its black and white photography coincides with the zenith of B & W world wide and shows accurately how ""green"" palm trees, as I saw in Key West and the Tortugas, register as a kind of white.

At the same time, its soundtrack is sufficiently confusing to force the listener to attend. It delivers translations in English, Russian, and Spanish and the effect is incantatory.

748207,3,630396835X,"Two undeniable facts: First, ""I Am Cuba"" is a cinematic triumph. Second, it is totalitarian propaganda of the highest and most dishonest order.

First, Mikhail Kalatzov comes from the school of Eisenstein, the present work highly reminiscent of the earlier director's films glamorizing the Russian revolts which led to the revolution. Kalatzov outstrips Eisenstein in that he uses a greater economy of movement, lenses and film types having greatly improved by 1964, not to mention directorial technique. Certain of the peasant scenes early in the film are reminiscent of Eisenstein's earlier filming in Mexico, which would lead to the eventual assembly and release of the masterpiece ""Que Viva Mexico"" (""Mexican Fantasy"") in 1979. Could Kalatzov have seen Eisenstein's unedited rushes prior to 1964? No matter how much one may admire Kalatzov's ""The Cranes are Flying,"" it is obvious that he has become incredibly dexterous in this film. The cinematic work is stunning.

Second, propagandists need to be more careful so as not to be so transparent in their disingenuousness. In this respect, ""I Am Cuba"" is an odious example of the fabricated record of how something did not happen. One need only read the works of and interviews with Fidel Castro to know that the movie is largely fiction. For example, he certainly did not have the sympathy of the students upon his landing in Oriente; the students were sceptical, considering Fidel had led scores of students to their certain death only a few years before with his disastrous storming of the barracks at Santiago. Nor did he have the support of Cuba's communists until well after the taking of Havana and the institutionalization of the revolution.

As Fidel likes to say the revolution only began with the taking of Cuba, that it continues to this day, one awaits the sequel. For in the present work, one must be amused at the cartoon presentation of the Americans in Havana, when the more sinister aspects of the mafia could have been shown. A ""Child of...."" follow-up would of necessity have to back up his claim that the Americans are still responsible for his revolution's failure. Another example is that, as Che Guevara had fallen from Fidel's and Moscow's favor by 1964, he is represented only in the penultimate chapter, when shown ever so discreetly in the Sierra Maestra instructing in communism the adolescent boys he so favored. ""Child of...."" would have to show Che as chief magistrate of the tribunal which executed over a thousand grudge match ""criminals"" after Fidel's victory. The revolution simply did not happen as the film depicts.

Just as Nietzche wrote of the genealogy of morals, so too is there a family tree of indecency masquerading as the moral. The film fails to relate that Fidel, when tried for the barracks disaster, resulting in over 60 immediate deaths and subsequent executions of those innocents, confronted the judges in a long speech in which he used the same declaration given a few short decades before by his hero, Adolf Hitler, proclaiming, ""History will absolve me."" The film fails to relate how Fidel had carried a worn copy of Mein Kampf during his undergraduate term at the University of Havana.

Unfortunately, it is the second aspect which foils the first. The tendency of totalarian regimes to create myths to support their glories, when the fabric of the truth is soiled, can only lead to eventual ridicule by scholars. In this respect, all of this film's cinematic achievements are betrayed by the embarrassing absence of truth and mythical fabrication.

It's like that attractive box of cereal at the super market, its glitzy colors gripping the eye, until you read the nutritional panel, revealing it to be but junk food, loaded with calories, sugar and carbs. In this instance, you find a box which fails to tell of how one tyranny replaced another, the latter even more destructive than the former.

Finally, just why and how did Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese get mixed-up in this nonsense? One can only admire and thank them for their involvement with Akira Kurosawa years before. Their roles as promoters of this film unfortunately tarnishes their images, making them to appear no more than caricatures of the usual Hollywood leftist camp.

Ah, well, just as Prokofiev and Shostakovich were under the thumb of Stalin, so too Kalatzov had to endure Khrushchev in 1964. One can only take heart that this film is not so well known as to besmirch his cinematic finery in ""The Cranes are Flying.""",1108598400,10,4514,4.98539176626826

This will tell you where the good doctor's review comes from in it's take on this piece of garbage - and can give you some insight into why you now have another reason to send your kid to private school.

Of course, I on the other know first hand what it is like to have everything taken and be forced to leave as my family did at the end of 1958 (the ""revolution"" started then, Castro just didn't take over until '59...but it was clear what was coming down the pike) thanks to the man who's image we put on toilet paper here in Miami, Florida.

The ""success"" of the revolution as it pertains to the health of Cuba is clear and well-settled.  So is the success of capitalism.  Yet there are those who still want to argue the point foolishly.  There are also those who somehow miss the point when admonishing the U.S. in it's stance on Cuba, while it, at the same time, somehow, has bestowed ""most favored nation"" trade status on Communist China. But, this is not something that's going to be changed, or even appropriately addressed within the confines of some meager review at Amazon.

El argumento est en Cuba un poco antes de la revolucin en 1959.  Hay diversas escenas durante la pelcula. Algunas escenas estn en discotecas de La Habana, y algunas estn en plantaciones del azcar y granjas de la montaa.

 La primera cosa que not sobre la pelcula, era que mostr muchas injusticias sociales que ocurrieron en Cuba antes de la revolucin.  Por ejemplo la pelcula mostr a terratenientes que tomaban la tierra de los granjeros que trabajaron los campos del azcar. Mostr a extranjeros que maltrataron a mujeres cubanos. Mostr a polica corrupto en La Habana.

 La segunda cosa que not era que se pareca como era mensajes polticos en la pelcula. Creo que estos mensajes polticos son del gobierno comunista de Fidel Castro.  Pienso que la pelcula retrat a americanos ser gente muy grosera y mala.  Es probablemente porque cuando la pelcula fue escrita, los Estados Unidos y Cuba eran enemigos.

748338,4,630396835X,"Mikheil Kalatozishvili's 1962 film ""Soy Cuba"", is an extraordinary film with a unique way of delivery.  ""Soy Cuba"" basically involves a few stories thrown together creating one film.  Yet there seems to be a nice flow, because all the stories can be pulled together in one main thought; ""the truth of the Cuban Revolution"".

The film includes four unique stories: a Cuban woman (Maria-Betty) is forced into prostitution and mistreated by her client (mostly American); a Cuban farmer is crushed after told to leave his sugar-cane fields, by the landowner; pro-Castro University students fight the police, causing tension; and the home of a family living in the hills, gets bombed, causing much anger, revenge and tragedy. The film describes how Cuba is not just a place or piece of land.  Cuba is all the poor people living there, all their sweat, blood, and tears are in the land; they are Cuba.

Kalatozishvili brings out these main occurrences from the Cuba Revolution and creates a realistic film based on poverty, the willingness of people, and the difference between right and wrong.  It seems so realistic by the way the cameras are set up to enhance the way the film is viewed by the audience.  It's as if Kalatozishvili has made you a part of the film itself and you are there with the characters; feeling their pain, suffering, frustration, and anger.  Similar to ""Soy Cuba"", is Steven Spielberg's 1993 film ""Schindler's list"".  Both these movies display the pain and suffering of ""the people"" and their aspect of life.

One aspect of the movie that becomes annoying is the combination of Russian and Spanish translations throughout the film.  Other than that, ""Soy Cuba"" is a great depiction of the truth in the people during the ""Cuban Revolution"" and is a film that should be viewed by all people 16 years or older.",1101168000,7,1827,4.861290322580645
748339,5,630396835X,"This is a four part movie based in Cuba.  It begins with the very poor who are only trying to get by.  They don't pay much attention to governmental affairs.  This vignette is about a prostitute and a fruit seller and their relationship.

From there we move onto a man who is looking ahead with his life because he has two children.  He is a farmer and he comes upon hard times.  He goes and takes out a loan against his farm and works extra hard.  He still looks to the future and we watch his sugarcane crop grow, but it is not to be.

The next vignette brings us the political atmosphere.  The government is run by Batista.  There is also an undercurrent of a revolution stirring headed by Castro.  This vignette demonstrates the power struggle within Cuba.

The final vignette circles back to the poor, but these people know more about the political struggle.  They chose to live far away from the fighting so they can be in peace.  They live in the mountains and they think that they are safe from the fighting until their peace is interrupted.

This is a very political movie.  As you are watching it you feel like there is no hope, that the poor will never better themselves, but as you near the end of the movie, you know that there is hope.  The director circles back to another family and even though they are not rich, they do have knowledge and they are living their own lives and making their own choices.",1097539200,5,1418,4.371647509578544

Because Castro wanted a country free from criminal US corporations like the United Fruit Company. Why don't Americans realize who the real terrorists are?
Because young people in the USA are not trained how to think or use logic and reason when making decisions about history, relationships, or anything that can determine how to create a future worth living in or looking forward to.

Viewers will see in this film the repression and appalling class differences of the Batista regime, the sacrifices and ambivalences of those who participated in the Revolution, and a symbolic representation of the triumph of the revolutionaries.  What I found compelling is that Castro is mostly an unseen presence in the film, perhaps more like a whisper than a presence.  Instead, the film rightly focuses on the lives of Cubans touched by this great human drama.  That is as it should be because the Revolution was about the Cuban people, not just one man.

They criticize United Fruit but the fact was that American Sugar Company built houses, schools and clinics for their workers, while the Cuban-owned mills did not and by 1959 60% of the sugar output was in the hands of Cubans.

The farmers, the students, the foreigners, the goverment, the rebels, the children, the land, and the ideas, they are Cuba.  The movie, which occurred during the revolution of Castro examines all of the aspects of Cuba at the time.  It looked at rich and poor people and connected the two groups.  The poor prostitutes connected with the businessmen of the United States.  The poor farmer connected with the rich fruit companies, and the students with, with the government.  I liked the movie, but it seemed to me that there was only one side to it.  I am Cuba was more a movie of propaganda than pleasure.  All americans were bad and the Batista government was horrible, but the prositutes, the rebels, and followers of Castro were the victims.

Format: DVD
This 'propaganda documentary' is an excellent example in that genre, BUT THIS IS NOT Cuba in the late 50s! It is no piece of factual history, but a fictional re-creation and re-invention of Cuba in 1958. It was filmed in 1964, by a Russian master of black and white photography, and this aspect of the film makes it visually rewarding and even beautiful.
But be warned!, the content is pure propaganda for Castro's tale of what took place in Cuba before '59. The politics of the film are NAIVE, and never beyond the depth of a political pamphlet.
It was filmed in 1963-64, in a Havana already in the grip of Castro and his Russian allies, barely two years after the Missile Crisis. The ""American"" tourists in the film are in reality Russian and Eastern European actors from the Soviet-Bloc behind the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. It is almost a political caricature, and a lesson in the art of cinematic fantasy and deception. But in a time when Che Guevara t-shirts and lighters sell well, and for the consumption of a fossilized 'left' who still wants to believe there is a revolution going on in Cuba (and not 50 years of squalor in a police-state), this piece of 'beautiful mythology' will do for ""history"".
