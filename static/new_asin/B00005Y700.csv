1674928,4,B00005Y700,"A small quiet film featuring the music of Miles Davis and starring Davis as, you guessed it a trumpeteer.  The film is about a man, John ""Dingo"" Anderson (Colin Friels), who hears Bill Cross (Davis) and his jazz group as he's on lay over at an airstrip and comes to the realization that music is his future, much to the chagrin of others.  His dream is to one day catch up with Bill in in Paris and play with him.
What really makes this movie though is the music. Davis does a superb job on the jazz soundtrack and if you see this movie you'll come to a mutual agreeance.  It was what initially latched me to this movie, and kept me hooked throughout.
A small film with a giant soundtrack.",971654400,24,689,4.244274809160306

7956542,5,B00005Y700,"There's a certain surrealistic quality to the whole thing I guess, and actually I'm surprised that the film got so many awards. Great trumpet playing to be sure, but what made it all believable for me though was Miles rasping ""You seem to have a lot of feeling for the music"" to a young Dingo Anderson.",1476489600,,302,4.410714285714286
7956543,5,B00005Y700,"Having just read a piece in the Sydney Herald on Australian films, I was interested in the commentary to the article which seemed to mostly go in favour of the view that most Aussie films suck, are low budget, can't deliver and won't get bums on seats. Sad, as I think there are some great films which are unique to Australia. This is one I knew nothing about until I saw it recently (October 2014) sitting on the bargain table at Humm in Newtown, Sydney. Now, I am a fan of Miles Davis and to see something he was involved in just before he died seemed too good an opportunity to pass up. It was worth the opening scene and then the live jazz club jam towards the end. Bits in-between were good in a 'Red Dog' sort of way but it is more that such an idea/collaboration was even thought of, let alone put into practice, which makes this worthwhile. As ever, the outback frames the mood well, as does small town Australia. As others note, it is slow in parts but more than makes up for this in the power of the story. Although not a classic, it is a warm hearted along the lines of 'follow your dreams' and it works. Miles Davis does not need to act, he is himself and at the end of time philosophical in a way which suits the heart of this film. Two hours in length. Highly recommended.",1415059200,4,1286,4.2105263157894735

7956545,5,B00005Y700,"This film deserved so much more distribution than it got. There is a trove of great Aussie films around, the other gem is 'Careful He Might Hear You' with Wendy Hughes and Robyn Nevin. In 'Dingo', the heart and soul is about following your dreams, even when everyone thinks you're a Wally (Aussie for loser). It's also about something that the Internet has destroyed - healthy longing. The kind that takes you on a journey within yourself on the way there instead of an instant download and you think you know everything. Colin Friels is perfect as a rare talent stuck inside a guy next door, with a niggling feeling that there's more to everything. And Miles Davis' performance is the eulogy that he wrote himself - about himself. None of the actors go on about crap. I love that. It's well written. If you like stories about reaching your dreams in a down-beat, kinda off-beat style, this is your film.",1343779200,4,904,4.62111801242236
7956546,5,B00005Y700,"This is a variation on a classic story of a man facing his destiny. He struggles against the odds, and has the help and example of a master to guide him. One of the oldest stories in the world; yet its always new.

Colin Friels' performance as Dingo Anderson was good. He brought a nice element to the story; a rugged outdoor type of Australian. One that is not normally associated with the world of jazz, yet showed that jazz is not as monolithic as most people would like to think.

Miles Davis, of course, stole every scene he was in. Playing jazz ""legend"" Billy Cross, he was, needless to say, not acting. His presence and personality were strong enough to fill the role as himself.

The best thing about Mile's performance is the bits of wisdom he presented. Those pearls of musical ""Zen"" he gave to his protege who'd come so far and endured so much to receive from him. For example, when they were driving through Paris one night, Anderson said he had a demo tape of new music. Cross said ""I don't want to hear it"". Anderson asked why. He said ""Because if I say I like it, you'll think I'm trying to be nice. If I say I don't like it, your feelings will be hurt. You don't need my opinions"". In other words, an artist has to ""know"" the true worth and merit of his music. He doesn't need validation or opinions. All musicians must stand alone; like a fighter in the ring (Miles was an amatuer boxer). That's when you really know who you are - and you don't need anyone else's praise to prove it.

All is all, a good movie.",1227139200,6,1527,4.291666666666667
7956547,4,B00005Y700,"A wonderful exploration on how life goes full-circle, the story surrounds a chance meeting of a young trumpet player and a jazz legend & how they cross paths years later.

Miles Davis portrays Billy Cross, the jazz icon who lives in Paris. Colin Friels is the trumpeter - John Anderson - who meets Cross before his hot chops gains him the slick moniker, Dingo.

And from that encounter, Dingo Anderson is placed on a musical journey, not only to strive for artistic excellence, but to seek out Cross one more time. This is a universal path, but in Dingo, the trek is paved through jazz charts calling out to Anderson & Cross.",1208304000,,625,4.571428571428571
7956548,1,B00005Y700,"After getting into Miles Davis' music a few years ago, I looked upon this film as one of the holy grails of jazz. Because it is out of print, I rented it so I could decide whether or not to buy a used copy. I was immensely disappointed at how poorly made this film is--and I wasn't hoping for a great film, but a decent little film with a jazz story and soundtrack. The characters weren't likable, and the direction and film editing were clumsy and sophmoric. This film had nothing but the soundtrack going for it, and that I could listen to on a CD. It looks as if Miles was picking up some extra cash and the makers were exploiting one of the greatest names in jazz. I like quirky little films that have some flaws, but this film has just too many.

For a good jazz film, try Round Midnight with Dexter Gordon. That one hit the mark.",1169510400,2,835,4.186335403726708
7956549,4,B00005Y700,"The film itself is simple: seemingly low budget and definitely not a Hollywood-directed-produced film. Its nonetheless charming. Colin Friels plays John ""Dingo"" Anderson, a man supporting his family in the outback of Australia doing odd jobs by day and playing in (what his band-mates call) a ""bush-band"" in the local halls at night. Although the band has fun, Dingo takes his trumpetting much more seriously; as a child, he had a run-in with famous jazz trumpeter Billy Cross (Miles Davis, in his only staring fictional role). Cross makes a deep impression on the young Dingo, who's lifes passion afterwards is to meet up with Cross in Paris. Despite financial hardship and a love-triangle treatening his marriage, Dingo takes a leap of faith and travels to Paris to meet his hero. The eventual meeting is not only a ""milestone"" for Dingo, its a type of redemption for Cross.

Although the acting is minimal, Davis is surprizingly convincing as not only a jazz trumpeter (duh), but also a man searching for meaning in his playing and a man discovering another lost soul like himself in Dingo. A slow-moving but nonetheless good film.",1112918400,15,1134,4.968421052631579
7956550,5,B00005Y700,"I first saw this movie on the movie channel Stars in about
1996. It's the kind of movie that makes you feel like you're
wandering in a hot, unforgiving desert, chasing after a mirage
that never quite comes into focus. It's dreamy quality is what
keeps me coming back. I would recommend this film to anyone who
daydreams or just needs a little magic in their lives. I loved it.",1010620800,7,376,4.385714285714286
