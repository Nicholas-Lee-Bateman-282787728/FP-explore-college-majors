5722586,3,B00CI61OUY,"Long on promise, short on delivery.  More tell than show.  I doubt we'll see the rest of the season's offerings.  What we sampled seemed to skip from point to point, very short on details.  The grannies spent a lot of time bickering.  ""Oh, that's so not right for you.  That's MUCH better."" One particularly seemed to fancy herself the fashion police.  Who cares?  We want to see the countryside.  The grannies do seem to be up for anything.  At least one of them.  The other is hampered by an acute fear of heights, which seems to cramp her travel adventures.  So we watch her watch her friend ride a camel, or we see her hide her face from a view over the mountainside road.  This is no Rick Steves travelogue.  It appears to have been concocted as a lark: travelogue meets 'reality tv.'",1397088000,,789,4.426573426573427
5722587,1,B00CI61OUY,Sorry but pretty run of the mill stuff.  Couple of folks wanted to go on a trip and suddenly had the idea of making a movie. There are hundreds of better Safari videos made by BBC.,1391731200,,180,4.0
8581960,5,B00CI61OUY,"It's Grannie time!  What a great family show, my children lost their own grannie a few years ago, and this reminded us of all the wonderful times with our sweet Grannie.",1502236800,,169,4.451612903225806
8581961,3,B00CI61OUY,it was just OK!,1472774400,,15,3.0
8581962,5,B00CI61OUY,"The hosts of travel shows are overwhelming white males, these ladies were a welcome and much needed change, I wish there were more seasons.",1470787200,,139,4.833333333333333
8581963,4,B00CI61OUY,Sister's Rock! I love how they give a unique perspective on places I've seen on other travel shows. African Americans spend Billions YES! Billions each year on travel. We look for some of the same things and different things as well. Grannies show me what to look for what to visit and how to enjoy myself as I travel the world at my age or any age.,1464134400,,349,4.223880597014926
8581964,5,B00CI61OUY,"Best series ever! I show my senior groups at my ""Arm Chair Travelers"" programs. They live this series and they were happy to hear I was able to replace what I had. We wore it out! I wish they would make more. These ladies are adorable",1461456000,,234,4.108695652173913
8581965,4,B00CI61OUY,"I think that some of the viewers just weren't used to seeing these travelers from a different background.  I enjoyed them, thought they were funny.
They behaved as long time close friends.  They showed places from the prospective of two senior Afro American women. I think they may have encouraged many to venture out.  Many people are afraid travel just because of such negative comments.",1456790400,,389,4.953846153846154
8581966,3,B00CI61OUY,Depends on the viewer. I lived in Africa for years and these ladies made it seem not so interesting as it was. Had to stop watching after 5 minutes.,1444867200,,148,4.137931034482759
8581967,1,B00CI61OUY,this was stupid and i could not watch more than 5 minutes of it.  i suppose the target audience may be children?,1438992000,,112,4.090909090909091
8581968,5,B00CI61OUY,This is a very good series.  Real people visiting real people.,1409097600,,62,4.636363636363637
8581969,5,B00CI61OUY,The program was interesting in that it used everyday people to visit a Country.  they were down to earth and not professional spokespersons,1405382400,,139,5.043478260869565
