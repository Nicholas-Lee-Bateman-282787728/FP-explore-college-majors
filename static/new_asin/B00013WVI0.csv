1969257,5,B00013WVI0,"I purchased this film upon the reviews that I had read and it was absolutely well worth the money and the wait.
This may not have started off with a multi million dollar financial package but it truly did not need it. There are no faults I can find with this film.
As others have said, the chemistry between Drew and Mark and that between Drew and most of the cast was brilliant and had just the right amount of humour as well as a basic feeling of wanting to be needed. It showed perfectly the relationship between Drew and each of the people who surround him and how they react to his slightly carefree attitude to life but the best thing is that it doesn't make him seem careless only carefree. This means that when he says that all he wants is someone to come home too you feel that he really means it and it is not for effect.
The ending may have been obvious to some within the first ten or so minutes but it did not stop the warm feeling rising when it happened and when Mark finally realised who he was and who wanted. The idea of not showing the incident and how Mark lost his memory was very well thought out. It gave us small glimpses throughout the film until the end when you finally get to see how the whole thing happened and why Drew reacts through the film as he does.
This a really very good film and is one that people should watch who want a feelgood film with what I can only describe as the perfect ending.
A TRULY TERRIFIC FILM.",1081987200,10,1451,4.167259786476868
1969258,4,B00013WVI0,"This is a small budget indi film that will settle into your heart.  The idea of repressed desire and living as others wish you would live was the same theme touched on in films such as Big Eden.  Director Michael Akers gives a warm and touching story of a man looking for love and another who doesn't even know who he is or what his life was like before the accident.  These 2 are truly likable characters.  Rounding out the cast is the brother who doesn't know how to express his love or frustrations, his Christian wife, the town doctor who's devotion to Drew transcends his sexuality and a shrewish wife who makes you understand why Mark would want to forget his past.  Fine acting and storyline that keeps you hoping that love wins out.  There is no preaching, no fear of AIDS, just a single gay man looking for his soulmate.  What could possibly be wrong with a movie like that?",1081382400,,883,4.41358024691358
1969259,5,B00013WVI0,"""Gone But Not Forgotten"" presents an original take on two themes
appearing in many gay movies: the struggles of a closet-case to accept
and live up to who he is, and the trials of an out-of-the-closet guy
determined to assert his own identity and forge his own life in his
small, rural town. The central premise is interesting and provocative:
how would a closet-case behave if he suddenly forgot his past, and how,
having gained a new perspective, would he react to his old life when confronted with it?  And there are some ironies: the guy from the back
woods, who adores the mysterious, good-looking, polished urbanite, and
in comparison with whom he probably feels slightly inferior, has
something essential to teach him, for all his sophistication, about
having the strength of character to be himself.
  The story is well plotted, with lots of dramatic tensions and
contrasts. There is, of course, the spectacular contrast between Mark's
life with Drew and Mark's life with Catherine.  But there is also the
tension between Drew and Paul, who movingly struggle to maintain their
close brotherly relationship in spite of different sexualities,
different attitudes to life, and unresolved emotional conflicts arising
from a tragic past. There is also an interesting tension between Dr.
Williams's insistence that Mark remember his past, and Drew's fear of
such a remembrance.  And, of course, there is Mark's own conflict
between his unwillingness and his obligation to remember.
  The characters are interesting and engaging. Scenes of effective
though sometimes understated drama reveal a surprising depth and
complexitiy to their personalities.  The Drew-Mark relationship, though
the principal, and most complex, is not the only one. The other
characters are not suborned to function merely as plot devices or Greek
choruses: Paul, Paul's wife, Nancy, and Dr. Williams all have
intriguing relationships with Drew, and Paul's and Drew's relationship provides an
engaging sub-plot. And, of course, there is that series of scenes
between Mark and his forgotten, furious, imperious, conflicted,
wounded, and by-no-means unjustifiably resentful wife, Catherine, which
remarkably succeed in being simultaneously electrifying and funny. The
very strong cast all give highly committed, developed, convincing, and three-dimensional performances.
  The story has not one but two central puzzles. First, of course, is
the mystery of Mark's forgotten past. Second is Drew's behaviour toward
Mark.  As I sat through the movie, I was at first uneasy about what seemed to me to be Drew's pressuring Mark into a relationship, as well
as Drew's constantly dismissing the necessity of Mark's remembering his
past (contrasted with the other characters constantly asserting, with
considerable insensitivity to Drew, the importance of Mark's
remembering
and returning to his past). When the whole incident on the mountain is
revealed toward the end, Drew's behaviour suddenly makes perfect sense:
he hasn't been pressuring Mark so much as encouraging Mark to be the
man he is; and Drew has known (or suspected), as the other characters have
not, the dangers inherent in Mark's remembering his past, and the
possibility of Mark's being driven to the brink again, should he return
to his past.
  For me, the most interesting and certainly the most admirable
character was Drew.  He has an irreverent, slightly subversive and
anarchic side which contrasts not only with the other Summit-Valley
characters (who, in spite of their affection for Drew, all in their own
ways express conventional, non-comprehending straight attitudes,
suggesting the loneliness of Drew's pre-Mark life), but also with Mark
himself. It is clear that Drew isn't perfect, a fact that gives
considerable interest and depth to his character: his struggles to live
as a gay man in a small-town environment have made him slightly
self-absorbed.  But his behaviour, especially as contrasted with Mark's
closetiness, displays both courage and a healthy (and probably
hard-won)
self-acceptance. Mark has a lot to learn from him.  Although Drew
sometimes seems weaker than Mark, because not so severely controlled,
he
is arguably the stronger, because more true to himself, more open, and
more accepting of his identity and emotions.",1079740800,9,4285,5.382660687593423
1969260,2,B00013WVI0,"After reading all of these ratings, I felt it an obligation to write a quick review--to hopefully save a lot of people money that would be better spent on deodorant.
This film, while honest and endearing in it's own right, is riddled with sub-par acting and a shaky plot.  There was never a moment during the film where I believed that these actors were anything but...actors.  They were raw and robotic and forced not only lines, but emotions and gestures.  The story had much promise...it was void of the trappings of urban life, the stereotypes and drugs and alcohol and all the other vices associated with the urban gay lifestyle.  And...it was not a trite premise in any way...it was unique and interesting.  But the unique and interesting premise never developed into a unique and interesting story.  It was rushed.  The relationships were unclear or lacking in poignancy.  The ending was not satisfying.  I didn't care enough about any of them to be happy with the ending.  When I watch a film or read a book, I invest my time, and sometimes my heart, in the good ones.  I felt nothing when I pressed the stop button on my DVD player.  I really doubt that most of you will either.
Rent this film if you want, but don't buy it.  The world of gay cinema may be limited but there are dozens more quality films that are worth the view and purchase.  This is just not one of them.",1079481600,6,1382,4.497991967871486
1969261,5,B00013WVI0,"Gone, but not forgotten is an outstanding film. I was impressed at the tasteful manner that the film was done and the excellant quality of production. The acting was good and the story was sweet, romantic and fulfilling. This is in the top two (Date Movies) I have seen. The other top date movie is ""Trick"". No heavy social comments or depressing subject manner, it did have some rather racey shots but nothing I would consider to be in bad taste. I would suggest you add this gem to your collection.

1969263,2,B00013WVI0,"I really wanted to like this film. and I applaud the filmmaker's attempt to tell what could have been a very engaging story, but this is one case where the lack of a budget may actually have hurt the overall effort. This plays like a first draft of a screenplay which fails to effectively expand on a good basic story. With better writing and more nuanced direction, even the shot-on-digital-video imagery would have worked. Matthew Montgomery is very effective, hampered as he is with the poor dialog written for his otherwise interesting character. I wanted a better movie for him to play in, since he tried very hard to convey the confusion and inner turmoil that Mark was going through. In this instance the fragmented flashback technique was used to good effect in helping the audience see the emerging story. Unfortunately, Aaron Orr, though he looked the part, is not a strong enough actor to match Montgomery's performance. His portrayal of the lonely, haunted Forest Ranger fell so far short of the mark that he actually bogged down the action and left me alternately confused and exasperated as I tried to figure out just what his character was really feeling. A stronger actor in this central role, again in spite of the weak dialog, would have elevated this film and made the whole viewing experience much more satisfying. The Writer/Director, Michael Akers, needs to hone his writing skills and take a cue from other, better films when attempting to build dramatic tension and craft scenes which touch the audiences emotions, which certainly could have been achieved with a story this good. Yes, this is a good Gay-Themed story and we need more films which promote a positive image for gays in these troubled times, but...they need to be WELL MADE films as well. We shouldn't have to settle for less, and that is why I can't recommend ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"".",1076544000,4,1874,4.841121495327103
1969264,5,B00013WVI0,"Simply put- this is the best, affectingly told gay romance films to be released over the past few years. If you walk away from this one and not moved by this impressive debut movie by Michael Akers- you're the Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz""- no heart! (heh heh) This movie will win you over on many levels- characters, plot, direction, and cinematography.
Do not rate the merits and ""final product"" of this film against bigger budgeted gay-themed films currently available, many of which disappoint with their ""been there; done that"" plots and stereotypes such as ""The Trip"" and ""Friends & Family."" You will be comparing ""apples to oranges"" and miss the message of this simple film. ""Gone..."" successfully shows the honest portryal of two gay men in their growing feelings as a couple in a honest but tasteful manner. In most main-stream ""Hollywood"" gay-theme films, the writers and directors seem more afraid not to offend and dilute the actors' characters and actions so you walk away from the film thinking you saw two ""straight buddies,"" not two gay men in genuine affection for each other. Mr. Akers has taken a much needed ""next step"" in breaking that pattern with this film.
I definitely recommend this one for your DVD collection over many other run-of-the-mill gay-themed movies available. It is also fun, entertaining, and informative to watch playing the commentary track with Michael Akers and Matthew Montgomery.",1075852800,5,1424,4.987394957983193

But if you're like the jillions of us rural gay men who live in beautiful settings but face social isolation, well, this story is about us. There seem to be 3 genres in gay film now - coming out stories, AIDS stories, and stories where urban gay men find their lovers cheating and reinvent themselves only to find that they were fine from the beginning (a basic reiteration of The Wizard of Oz). We rural gay men don't find ourselves in any of that nor do we see ourselves in progressive TV.

I read some other reviews before I decided to write my own one.
I wouldn't agree that the film is bad, but I don't see eye to eye with all those who regard it as ""master piece"".
There are things that don't let me give this one more than 3 stars.
These are: acting (but still better than in many others films I have seen so far), sound (sometimes the noises in background are too loud to hear the actors) and some dialogues.
I found the story very intersting and romantic. I am pretty sure that with higher budget the director could have done even better.
It is a flip of the coin if I buy this one, but the option is open :)",1299628800,4,712,4.056737588652482

I do not recommend buying this DVD, rent it if you must",1250812800,3,294,4.290909090909091
1969273,2,B00013WVI0,"Some people might click ""not helpful"" simply because I gave this little movie two stars.  Yeh, it's kind of a low rating, but please know that I didn't hate this film... let's be fair and say it had some good points, lots of bad points, and many points in between.  Let's also be fair and say that those who gave the film five stars didn't look very far beyond its emotional value, and those who gave it one didn't look beyond its lack of technical polish.

The truth is that ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" has both.  It's another in a string of independent films that wants to tell an earnest gay romance but gets bogged down by a lack of money, experience and talent.

This film was undoubtedly put together on a shoestring budget, and it really shows.  The soundtrack is unbearable at points, and there are a few editing and film stock shifts (especially the swimming scene where the lake and background suddenly turn yellow) that are jarring.  There's no arguing that this is an amateur movie with some truly painful technical moments.

That said, the story is engaging enough and most of the acting is at least ok.  As much as I didn't care for Aaron Orr as park ranger Drew (his delivery just struck me as odd throughout the film), I did like Matthew Montgomery as Mark, who has the thankless task of taking on the world's hoariest plot device (amnesia) and making it seem plausible.

I have to add that, story-wise, I was really uncomfortable with how agressively Drew pursues the amnesiac Mark.  At the climax of the film, we find out that there's a reason for this pursuit, but it didn't remedy the fact that Drew gave me the creeps beforehand.

In the end, this film compares directly with ""Big Eden""... both have a mountain/forest setting and are centered on a ""will they or won't they"" story line.  Yes, in ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"", the leads are hunkier and there is the tender love-making scene that's missing from ""Big Eden"".  But - and I know some people will shriek over this - ""Big Eden"" is a far better film, both technically and thematically.  If you're planning a purchase of either film, I'd definitely recommend ""Big Eden"" first.",1248220800,4,2148,4.5863874345549736

I'm absolutely enchanted by the wonderful story, and characters I really care about. With his very first scene, Aaron Orr draws me to his character, and throughout the movie, proceeds to make me laugh with and cry for Drew. His chemistry with Matthew Montgomery is nothing short of electric, and the two of them easily make me forget that Drew and Mark are only characters on the screen.

The less polished production quality is one of the things I love most, and every time I watch it, I'm so happy with this little gem, created by the talented writers, cast and crew with such a tight budget.

Recommended by a friend, it isn't the type of genre I would normally watch. I decided to persevere, as I'm disillusioned with most of the movies that are made these days.

Captivated from the beginning with the character of Drew and the intrigue surrounding Mark I eagerly awaited the story to unfold. By the end of movie I was astounded that the story had consisted of intrigue, drama, comedy, angst, sexuality, death and love all interwoven by amazing storytelling.

The comedic touches are based on simple life events and had me laughing out loud. The romantic scenes are beautifully done. A strong emotional scene had me in tears, it was heart breaking. The attention to detail to tie everything together at the end is perfect.

The scenery and setting is gorgeous. The fact that the movie was made on a really small budget is astounding. It goes to show that if you have a good story and dedicated movie makers then millions of dollars are not necessary.

The only bad thing about this movie is that is had to end.

It's not as good because: the acting is as bad -- with a few exceptions -- as most have noted. The script is pretty lame. ""Hello? General Hospital called. They want their dialog back."" The set decorator/production designer should be taken out and beaten because the interior of Drew's house is just plain ugly and there's no computer in the barren `Forest Service' office! There are too many lapses in logic. Examples: They didn't bother to cook the ""rabbit stew"" after Mark added the vegetables. And it was an unforgivable breach of doctor-patient confidentiality for kindly Dr. Williams to tell Mark that Drew was gay. ""Cute"" actors and Happily Ever After endings do not score extra points in my book. On the other hand, this movie is not as bad because: the plot is certainly different. The exterior shots are gorgeous. I liked the original music. And the woman who played Dr. Williams and the man who played Drew's brother both did pretty well. Watch it and judge for yourself.

I found the dynamic between Mark and Drew very believable; especially Mark's Touch-me, WAIT, go away, No Please Touch me reaction to Drew.

About the sex scene:  I find a compelling quality about it that one seldom finds in film.  In some ways it had an intensity similar to the Voilet and Corky love scene in Bound.  The director saught to provide a sex scene that gave a valid portrayal of male sexuality, without resorting to pornography.  He accomplished that goal quite well.",1190937600,3,689,4.779661016949152

I had to turn this off and force myself back to it several times as that was how bad the acting and production was (even the doctor writing a prescription or pouring water looked and sounded blatantly fake). And as bad as the production and acting was it was nothing compared to conflicts between some of the characters that made little sense whatsoever. The only kudos I can give is the overall premise and story was acceptable, although drawn out way too long, and the relationships could have be incredibly fulfilling but the senselessness really hurt it so only the main interactions could be called even sweet if one can bear through the glaring flaws of this film.

So some congrats to the writer and main actors for at least being able to get that across regardless of the faults but a big thumbs down for the entirely unnecessary and pretentious setup for the brief attack on Christianity from both gay main and Christian wife in the film that went beyond the character. Don't get me wrong a character can have any beliefs but the ""story"" should not be religiously intolerant. On the other hand a thank you for partially making up for that by suggesting the main gay character goes towards Christianity / God and his family though that could have been demonstrated stronger by the family inviting to church with them rather than just invited to dinner IF that was what was intended.

If you can bear such faults then may be worth a watch, I recommend rent first. Definitely not something mainstream can watch, unlike Latter Days which I recommend strongly instead.",1166832000,,1698,4.694630872483222

1969297,5,B00013WVI0,"I bought this movie a few weeks back and totally loved it. Yes, the film is independant and cheaply-made, but the important part is that the cast and crew don't let any of that get in the way of simply telling a good story.

As another reviewer noted, ""Gone but Not Forgotten"" is not edgy or gritty, there's no pretention here (like you find in a lot of independant films), the movie isn't trying to be something, it's just telling a simple, honest tale. And it's brilliant. This is the kind of story that Hollywood would make for about $300,000,000. But it's done so much better here, because it's just so honest and heart-warming.

The characters are all rounded and developed, the two leads are great together and make a cute couple. Matthew Montgomery does a great job as Marc, but Aaron Orr really impressed me with the character of Drew, just a great guy. And I was particularly impressed by the character of Nancy, who gives us a positive portrayal of the Church. As a religious person myself, this was refreshing and wonderful to see.

The storyline is engaging, the characters likeable and interesting, and at the end of the day it's just a great film that makes you feel better for watching it. Basically I can't recommend 'Gone but Not Forgotten' enough.",1134604800,31,1265,4.638392857142857

Sorry to disappoint!",1130716800,13,278,4.75
1969299,5,B00013WVI0,"This may have been a low-budget film, but the cast and the acting are superb. There are new faces: Aaron Orr, Matthew Montgomery, and some more familiar faces: Bryna Weiss, Joel Bryant, Brenda Lasker, Ariadne Shaffer. The acting from all is brilliant and their portrayal of their characters is absolutely believable. There's none of the attitude and arrogance that so often marks and mars the performance of Hollywood's chosen few.

I was especially impressed with Aaron Orr who was absolutely natural and never missed a beat in his role as one of the two central characters. Matthew Montgomery seemed a bit forced early on, but came into his own and gave a sterling performance overall. Watch the film once, then watch it again and look more closely at the eyes of the two as they interact.

The rest of the cast play their roles with flair, and give a depth to their characters that becomes more apparent with each viewing (this is a move you will want to watch again and again).

The film goes places that Hollywood has apparently forgotten how to go. Whether you're gay, straight, or anything in between (even Druids will find something to be enthused about in this movie ;-), you'll find yourself emotionally involved with the characters and wishing the film didn't have to end. If you've got one spark of romance in your soul, this movie will set it to blazing (to paraphrase Granny Clampett speaking about her Spring Tonic).

Michael Akers and Sandon Berg can be proud to have created one of the finest movies that, in my humble opinion, has ever been made.

Watch it, and prepare to be entertained, kept on the edge of your seat, compelled to identify with at least one character in the film, and most importantly, to smile. If your faith in humanity has been eroded by watching the world unfold around you in recent years, you'll come away from this film with the conviction that there may be some hope after all.

The musical score is worth the price of the movie, by itself. Especially, the beautiful and haunting Staring Straight Into The Sun, by the very talented Jared Young. I've had the song stuck in my head for days.

Enjoy!",1126742400,49,2142,4.680851063829787
1969300,4,B00013WVI0,"Gone, But Not Forgotten is a gay romantic film that is good for a first try. We see Drew a forest ranger who rescues Mark from jumping off a cliff. When in the hospital they ask him his name and he can't remember. Obviously he is suffering from amnesia. From the beginning we see that Drew is very attractive to Mark.(The body language says it all and innuendoes) When Mark seems to be getting better Drew offers to take him home and try to help him remember by taking him canoeing, cooking with him little helpful things. During the film we see little flash backs of his experience on the cliff. (Nothing important until the love scene and when he gets his memory back)come on you knew it was gonna happen O-O. While sitting on the couch one night Mark and Drew have an important conversation about what really happened this is after they've been having sex. Drew tells him that Mark said ""Tell her im sorry."" After a fight in the car Drew find that Mark is missing. Returning to the hospital we find out that Mark has a wife and went back home. From watching how she acts around him there is something wrong. We see him looking confused and she has to explain things to him.(She doesnt seem to be very happy about it either) Certain things have changes as well they use to both drink martinies but now Mark seems to hate them. As the story unfolds Mark asks the clincher question ""Are we always like this"" meaning are we always this unhappy. From that question we find out what really happened. Marks wife had him followed and he has been meeting MEN at hotels and having sex with them. His memory finally returns and he makes the decision to go back to Drew. What a happy ending hurray. This movie is a little boring in some parts but like i said before it is good for a first try. The acting is well the say bad but the story is a genuine one. This isn't a collectors item but for anyone who is interested in gay films should try to see this movie just for the experience. The love scene in the movie isn't extreme like a hot porn which is a good thing if you want to watch something sweet and cute.

Where to begin? This is not a low budget film, it is a no budget film, it is appalling. The acting is wooden beyond cult status redemption, it is impossible to feel any empathy at all with the characters. The production values are non existent. If there really was a DOP involved they should be shot and never allowed near a film set again. What was it with the changing colour temp during scenes, and the lighting, that was a joke. I think the fact this project was written and edited by the director speaks volumes. A self indulgent pile of tripe! You couldn't even compare it with a student film; a student would have put in more effort.

The only redeeming feature, if there is one, is the concept.

Kudos to the guy who played Drew's brother for being the most believable actor in the story. I found the Doctor fairly believable as well. Having said that, everyone's performance including the 2 leads looked like something out of community theater that forgot to rehearse before going in front of the camera. Every performance was weak! It's as if there was noone behind the camera directing at all!

On the technical side, the audio was particularly bad: Vocal overdubs that were totally sterile (no ambiance at all), dialog levels that changed from scene to scene, and a music bed that was disproportionately loud to the dialog.  I'm convinced that whoever did the audio post-production only did it to demo their own music.

Then there's the poor camera work and lighting. While the camera was steady and properly exposed, there was no thought given to camera position or lighting the set to make the shots more interesting. NONE! The scenic beauty of the location was never used to full advantage.

In every respect, this looks like a film student's first try at makking a home movie. How it gathered any nods at all is totally beyond my imagination.

Yes, as some reviews here on Amazon.com have stated, it's made on a shoe-string budget, the secondary characters are not fully developed and some of the dialogue is as cheesy as all get out. But do not let you scare you away, I didn't give this movie 4 stars for just the pretty boys in it.

What this movie does have and have in spades in *heart.* From each frame, from each song, you can tell the writer/director, Michael Akers lovingly crafted this movie together with his producing partner, Sandon Berg.

If I were going to put my hard-earned money down and take a chance on an indie film, I take my chances with this one. Why? Because the two leads (Aaron Orr and Matthew Montgomery). They quietly sizzle together. And that's what this movie is about to me, their chemistry, it's natural, not forced, not over-acted.

The plot isn't new, but still who doesn't love a good amnesiac story in a romance movie? Mark (Montgomery) is found after a fall suffering from amnesia and rescued by Drew (Orr), a Park Ranger. Drew feels an instant connection to Mark, but Mark isn't sure of his own confused feelings. But their friendship as they grow to know each other develops into something more intense and that's when Mark's past comes back to shatter their new found happiness.

There was obviously a lot of effort involved in bringing the story forward, but there was an element of predictability and insincerity from some of the moments, kind of like 'too much sell' that you might get in a retail outlet.

The story was reasonable, but the only characters that seemed to get significant development were the two leads, everyone else was either a characiature or a cartoon (especially the wife with reference to the latter).

I watched this at a festival, and there were moments where members of the audience were quoting passages of dialogue word for word before they came on screen.  True, it was extremely annoying to have people doing that in the middle of the theatre, but it was definitely indicative of the whole thing.

Akers and his entire production team managed to do a lot with limited resources. The second audio commentary track details many of the challenges involved in making an independent film. This one is not to be missed!",1090713600,12,536,4.536082474226804
1969349,1,B00013WVI0,"One man wrote, directed, and edited this ridiculously long melodrama. Re-titled, ""Joan Crawford Loves Joan Collins"" this story requires a three movie expansion to help him swing his extra thick plot-punch (not to mention smacks, bitch-slaps, and panic-attacks.)

1969351,5,B00013WVI0,"Yes, it is evident that this is a low budget movie.  But sometimes low budget simply means that the honesty and the true meaning of the story get to be front and center.  That is the case with Gone But Not Forgotten.
The acting is simple and natural...meaning, the actors don't over do it.  Real people aren't actors and these actors portray the characters as real people, not Hollywood idols. But this is not to say the acting in not powerful, because it is.  Matthew Montgomery's scene with Aaron Orr in the livingroom where Mark's character asks Drew to tell him about the rescue is riveting.  Montgomery's acting skills are right on the money.
There is a soap opera-like quality to the storyline and trust me that's not a bad thing. But one can't argue with the accomplishments of this movie.  The lovemaking scene is incredible in its sensativity and its honest credibility.  This is a perfect depiction of love in my opinion.
Gone, But Not Forgotten is one of those films that is better than the sum of its parts.  When one reads about the elements of the story, it sounds like a daytime soap and as I said, that's not a bad thing. However, some may end up believing this movie isn't a great movie, but it is.  Its one of those truly rare movies that speaks directly to one's heart.",1085184000,113,1288,4.493562231759657
1969352,1,B00013WVI0,"The acting is poor, plot is way too simple. I know this is a low budget film, but the quality is too bad, like a home DV video.",1085184000,,127,3.5714285714285716
1969353,4,B00013WVI0,"after reading all the reviews here I just keep my remarks to myself because everthing is said about this movie. I have watched it I guess 10 times and still love it. It's a touching love story, the acting is a little amateur like, but it makes this film still worth watching. There are just 2 kinds of reviewers here, either they love it or hate it. I'm one of those loving it.",1084060800,9,377,4.178082191780822
1969354,1,B00013WVI0,I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail about the plot of this movie but instead I'm gonna focus on the two things that were truely horrible with this film.  The acting was an atrocity.  I've seen better performances at high school plays.  The dialogue was equally bad and you will find yourself nodding off for most of this film.  The one thing that was done well (moderately) in the film was the love scene...which was not graphic but slow and sensual.  Other than that there is nothing good to say about this dvd.  The best thing about this dvd was the cover.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  A complete waste of time!,1083369600,6,627,4.299145299145299

You have two men from totally different sides of the human culture, where each has suffered psychological  damage which is both self inflicted and with external causal relations!  This film is window through which we can follow these two men reactions in a budding relationship.  It is a very large lesson in humanity for all of us!!  NJMJr!",1509062400,,378,4.84375
