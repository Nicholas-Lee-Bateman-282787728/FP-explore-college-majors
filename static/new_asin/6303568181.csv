7850960,4,6303568181,Thirties' noir.  Fun film to watch as long as you don't expect the moon.  Was like watching the old black and white gangster movies.,1454284800,,132,4.458333333333333
7850961,5,6303568181,"If you love Mark Harmon, an just plain ol' love a good movie, then this film is for you. Based on the actual events that led up to John Dillinger's death, this film will keep you smiling and rooting for the bad guy the whole way.

Mark Harmon, as alway, nails this role.",1264550400,5,270,4.09433962264151
7850962,3,6303568181,"Yet another movie (this one made for TV) about famous 1930's bank robber John Dillinger.  This time Dillinger is played by Mark Harmon and Marshal Melvin Purvis, Dillinger's nemesis, is played by Will Patton. Moves too fast to become boring, but its instantly forgettable despite the good cast.  Stick with John Milius' 1973 movie of the same name.",985046400,6,348,4.982758620689655
