4104750,5,B003AUTC0G,"I have tried to read this famous book of Adof Hitler's several times, but geez the first two chapters are dreadfully boring. By listening to this important book in your car you are able to get thru some chapters that are anything, but exciting. Yes, there is some anti-semitic comments in the book, but really no more than many books written in the same era that ""Mein Kampf"" was written. For those questioning why I say this book is 'important' I must say that because its part of a prelude to a war/event that redefined world history.

It is also worth noting that ""Mein Kampf"" is and has been a world-wide, number one best seller for decades and I believe the proceeds from the sale of this book(although, possibly not this copy)go to Jewish causes.",1326844800,8,752,4.57037037037037
4104751,4,B003AUTC0G,"Ever since the demise of the Third Reich, people around the world but especially in the West have searched for answers as to what made Hitler tick. Now I don't profess to know as I did not know him personally, but this documentary Understanding Hitler comes closest of any I have seen to the view that I have developed over my years of fascination with the subject: that is that people didn't follow Hitler because of his antipathy toward Jews and foreign (i.e. non-Western) minorities such as the Gypsies, but rather despite that aspect of his personality. They followed him because he offered them hope when everything seemed hopeless and because he best articulated a bright and heroic future for the nation.
This two DVD set covers many areas: The development of Hitler's worldview in the context of the times; one of the best explanations of Mein Kampf that I have heard; a sample reading from the modern English translation of Mein Kampf; an assortment of propaganda films both light-hearted and very serious, plus a film on the Secret Life of Adolf Hitler that revolves mostly around social gatherings at the Eagle's Nest and his relationship with women, particularly Eva Braun.
I give it only four stars because the main documentary makes a couple of very serious errors and glides over how Hitler came to discover the small political party which he subsequently dominated. Understanding Hitler does not make clear that it was the Bavarian Army he joined and not the Austrian Army. It fails to mention that he fled to Bavaria to avoid military service in his native Austria because he despised the multi-cultural and shambolic nature of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And as for joining the German Worker's Party, he wasn't particularly searching for a place to fit in but working as an army spy supposed to be keeping tabs on extremist groups that sprung up after the First World War when he stumbled upon a meeting of their's and was drawn to the party's philosophy. There are other errors, put it down to sloppy editing.
Viewers might find interesting the section on Mein Kampf where it is explained how poorly translated earlier English editions  of Mein Kampf led to the generally held view that it is a poorly written and rambling book. Actually it isn't ""written"" at all, but taken as dictation from a series of soliloquies Hitler gave while pacing his prison cell and later at his home.
Of the propaganda videos, my favorite is the one that shows a happy, ordered, and carefree lifestyle in Berlin under the Nazis. The best and rather chilling film, however, is the one that shows people with all sorts of disabilities and which makes a case for euthanasia chiefly because of the cost to the state of caring for them.
The Secret Life of Hitler is interesting mainly because of insights given by associates of Hitler who survived the war and it's portrayal of Eva Braun as kind of a self-absorbed airhead.
Overall, this set is well worth the small price paid and those interested in the subject should find it quite illuminating. No booklet is included, just two discs and the minimal information provided on the clamshell.",1320278400,19,3136,4.828996282527881
4104752,5,B003AUTC0G,"Why did people follow Hitler? Many people have wondered that and found the answer elusive. Now, in this incredible documentary on DVD, you'll learn the true history that created a warm nest for Hitler and what he did with it. Moreover, it shows you many little-known facts about Hitler and his rule of the Nazi party --- including many of the things Hitler and his party did to the Jews, which have not been discussed in most forums.

The description above says this is a 1-minute DVD. That, of course, is incorrect. This is a full-length documentary that will give the viewer a tremendous education on Hitler, his book, Mein Kampf and the development of the Nazi party and its activities, many heretofore unknown.

If you're interested in this era of history, I strongly advise you to get a copy of this powerful documentary and the bonus DVD that comes with it while it's still available. It's a small price to pay for the tremendous amount of information you will garner. Above all, you'll discover why people followed this person and you will begin to understand him.

This DVD is very well done, very professional and nicely packaged. It's a must-have addition to the library of all history buffs and those interested in the power that was Hitlers.

8393218,5,B003AUTC0G,"What I found most helpful in this valuable DVD is the clear and detailed explanation of the Treaty of Versailles and how that enraged the German nation and contributed to the beginning of WWII.  It also explained WHY there was such animosity toward the Jews.

I have a very extensive WWII video library, and this excellent documentary contains much new information/videos.",1443571200,3,372,5.081967213114754

8393226,3,B003AUTC0G,"My suggestion? Skip conformist biographies and explanations of Hitler if time is short and read the one book that provides the necessary insight and understanding of Hitler that is found no where else: R.H.S. Stolfi's 'Hitler: Beyond Evil and Tyranny'.
Oh yes, my friends......read this book! It is a biography of the Fuhrer like no other. It is the one book that needed to be written.",1351641600,2,385,4.848484848484849
