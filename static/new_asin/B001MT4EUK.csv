It's a hilarious premise and I felt the era was presented very well with the casting. I also felt the special effects were incredible for such a low budget film.",1418428800,,262,4.458333333333333
8389954,5,B001MT4EUK,"My wife and I saw this along with a full length film made by an energetic and very talented couple from California in a local arts movie house. This was just the lead-in short, but it was wonderful! I won't spoil it except to say that it is the newsreel record of a very significant event in international relations and American Sports History.
(I'll give one hint: I usually don't guffaw, but I sure did watching this clever film)
