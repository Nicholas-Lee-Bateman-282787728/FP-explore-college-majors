4491759,5,B004X2JNE0,"This is an incredible journey of Scotland's countryside.
There is no narration, so the experience is rather like a long meditation.
A person can easily, be lulled asleep and certainly easily relaxed from a tense day by watching this.",1360454400,3,233,5.0
4491760,3,B004X2JNE0,"I had expected more of a travelogue, documentary treatment of Scotland. However, the scenes are beautiful and the music restful and pleasant, so I guess it's OK.",1358553600,4,161,5.0
4491761,5,B004X2JNE0,"Paul MacLean's A Journey Through Scotland is a sumptuous travelogue video through the Scottish Highlands, down back roads, rolling hills and over the glistening countryside. Its intention isn't to provide historical anecdotes about the various locations -- but rather transport the viewer to the location itself and gather a sense of time and place. Backed by unobtrusive, carefully selected music, this is a splendidly shot and edited production that ought to be replayed time and time again. Gorgeous!",1352073600,5,503,5.461538461538462

4491763,4,B004X2JNE0,"This DVD perfectly captures the beauty and atmosphere of the Scottish highlands. You can almost feel the mist and cool air and wet grass while watching this DVD. Glen Coe, Ben Nevis, the Isle of Skye, The Borders -- all Scotland's most amazing landscapes are included, with beautiful Scottish music.",1351641600,3,299,5.0

4491765,1,B004X2JNE0,"although the video has some nice photography, it is only pictures with music in the background.  It's more like a really long screen saver.  THere is no explanation to indicate where in scotland things are, what time of year it is, etc.  Pretty, but with the music, it's so relaxing and boring you want to fall asleep.  You will not ""journey"" through anything but a long list of questions wondering where the places are and what their significance is.  I paid for this after I saw it on Prime.  Not worth the purchase to me.",1338595200,3,524,4.463157894736842

8445981,4,B004X2JNE0,"Breathtaking scenery dominates this near-one hour excursion into the Scottish highlands.  No dull, talky history lessons or trite TV show hosts here, this is just copious scenes of gorgeous, dramatic scenery.  This video *does* take things at a leisurely pace (and may prove a stumbling block for those used to more frenetic entertainment).  But if you take the time to immerse yourself in it, you'll find it very stress-relieving.  Recommended for anyone craving a soothing, relaxing journey, which captures the stark beauty and remoteness of the Scottish highlands (and best of all allows you to experience it without getting rained on, or bitten by midges!).  It's also nice to hear authentic Scottish folk music on the soundtrack (as opposed to the pseudo-Irish music usually tracked into in Scottish subjects).",1442102400,,815,5.286821705426356
8445982,1,B004X2JNE0,"The description didn't explain how slow and how quiet this would be.  I was searching in an area of informational videos because
I want to learn about Scotland.  This may give a name of a place here and there, but it doesn't tell you where you are in Scotland
geographically.  There isn't any helpful information really.  The music was terrible too.  Maybe someone else wants this type of video,
but I was very disappointed.",1441584000,,424,4.675675675675675
8445983,5,B004X2JNE0,Item received in perfect condition.  Thank you.,1441324800,,47,5.714285714285714
8445984,2,B004X2JNE0,Was hoping for something more informative. This is basically just  continual landscape shot with music. Reminds me of a screen saver.,1433894400,,133,5.333333333333333
8445985,4,B004X2JNE0,Beautiful scenery but I wish more had been labeled to give me an idea of where things were.,1433808000,,91,4.111111111111111
8445986,2,B004X2JNE0,Without commentary it was not really of any interest to us. It would help if such items were described as not having any commentary.,1428105600,,132,4.541666666666667
8445987,5,B004X2JNE0,Very handy for planning a trip to Scotland.,1423785600,2,43,4.5
8445988,2,B004X2JNE0,This could have been so much better.. If someone would have taken the time to narrate. It works good for back ground sound and a look up..,1361232000,,138,4.148148148148148
