The flick is divided into segments for each eccentric surfer's personal story followed by some of their surfing. I liked it because it's short enough to keep my interest and if I'm not in the mood to hear about their lives, I can watch the just surfing selection in the special features.",1409011200,,390,4.666666666666667
