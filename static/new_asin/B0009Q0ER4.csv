8065182,5,B0009Q0ER4,Great DVD. I haven't had a kid who didn't love it. The lesson is timeless it'll never get old. We almost have the entire series.,1394236800,,128,4.16
8065183,1,B0009Q0ER4,"This little video was stunningly animated, and the score was well done. The producers tried real hard to make it hip and fresh. But it was a very poor film. The Bible story wasn't just watered down it was butchered. The roaches and a conscientious lion had more to do with saving Daniel than the angel. While I really enjoy Toby Mac and Nicole C. Mullen, the songs they performed were contrived and out of place in the story, as well as worthless outside of it. I found it on sale for $3. It was neither worth a penny, nor the space it takes on a shelf.",1262995200,2,553,4.177570093457944
8065184,5,B0009Q0ER4,"I have just viewed Thr Roach Approach's The Main Event and found it to be a charming animated story with a biblical theme.  Even though it's a child-oriented movie, it is entertaining for adults as well.  I strongly recommend it for viewing for the entire family.

8065185,5,B0009Q0ER4,"A new twist to the oldest stories are just what is needed to spark the attention of the younger generation.  Kids will love these characters obviously created by someone who is genuinely interested in changing the world through love of, and faith in  God.  Making it fun is part of the attraction!  The sweat and attention to detail that went into these products is obvious.  The star-level talent contributing to the music package speaks (sings) for itself.  Other reviewers with shallow comprehension who can't spell 'hurricane' will fail to see the entertainment value and will selfishly withhold this entertaining teaching tool from children with eager and open minds.  I find that offensive.",1129248000,4,696,5.160714285714286
8065186,1,B0009Q0ER4,"I'm glad I previewed this before showing it at my church.  A child might leave this movie believing that roaches were there in the lion's den helping to mediate between the lions and Daniel.  Add a rapping bat with heavy gold jewelry, and the power of the original story is completely lost.  I can't in good conscience even pass this on to someone else, as I find it so offensive.  It will be in this week's garbage.",1129075200,5,416,4.363636363636363
