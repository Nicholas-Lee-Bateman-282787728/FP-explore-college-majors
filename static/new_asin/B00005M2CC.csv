1623725,5,B00005M2CC,"Yes METROPOLIS is the movie that everybody knows and while it is a highly influential work of world cinema, for my money Fritz Lang's true masterpiece is DR. MABUSE, THE GAMBLER especially when seen in this new authorized edition from Kino which runs 270 minutes. That's 57 minutes longer than the previous Image release which was the standard bearer up until now. There is so much I could say about this release but I will do my best to try and be concise. All of the elements that make Fritz Lang's movies what they are are on display here. The set design is truly astonishing not only for how it looks but for how it complements the action that is going on in front of it. The cinematography by Carl Hoffmann is fabulous especially when seen in a proper restoration like the one here. The editing is first rate as it highlights the dramatic action and the characters throughout the film. The characters are also fascinating to watch and there are so many of them. In many ways DR MABUSE plays like a silent version of Quentin Tarrentino's PULP FICTION (the source material IS pulp fiction) which leads me to what for me is the real strength of the picture and that is the screenplay by Thea von Harbou. The principal themes of guilt, intimidation and redemption which occur throught Lang's work are fully displayed here for the first time. Although they are often pointed out as the biggest weakness in his pictures I think just the opposite. Von Harbou's screenplays are grounded in silent film storytelling which makes them appear simplistic but like a fairy tale or other allegorical work there is a lot more when you look below the surface. It is rather telling after Lang left her and Germany that the principal themes of her scenarios crop up again and again in his work from LILIOM to SCARLET STREET to HOUSE BY THE RIVER. Rounding out the film are the vivid performances of Rudolf Klein-Rogge (Harbou's ex-husband and Rotwang in METROPOLIS) as Dr Mabuse, Bernhard Goetzke (DESTINY) as von Wenk, Alfred Abel (METROPOLIS) as Count Told and especially Norwegian actress Aud Egede Nissen as the ill-fated Cara Carozza who is the heart and soul of the story. One unintended effect by Lang is that the film is now an incredible time capsule of 1920's Berlin and what the world of CABARET must have been like. Rounding out this double DVD set are background documentaries on the making and meaning of DR. MABUSE including a marvelous part with composer Aljoscha Zimmerman and how he created his new background score which is absolutely perfect. Any lover of movies silent or sound should have this release as an example of a top director at the peak of his powers and as a prime example of how a restoration of a classic film should be done.",1153526400,28,2745,4.661855670103093
1623726,4,B00005M2CC,"I have loved this film since I saw it on a big screen in film school. As a collector and afficionado of both silent and sound film noir, to me, Dr. Mabuse has no equal. Not only was it made in 1922 by the great Fritz Lang from a novel by Norbert Jacques; not only did it presage Hitler's rise and subsequent fall, but it was prescient about the future in a way that Metropolis, another famous Lang film, was not. This was the truth about Germany in the 1920's and Mabuse film scholar(hard to believe there is such a thing, but there you go),David Kalat enhances this two disc set with his insightful, though occasionaly over-analytical, commentary.

My problem with the Image Entertainment DVD is this: the version I saw in film school had a much different and more cohesive score by Konrad Elfers that features one of the most haunting, yet uplifting themes in all silent film music history. Why this score was not used by Image baffles the mind. The new score, while in surround sound, does nothng to highlight the jazz age in the Weimar Republic as does Elfer's magnificent composition. My first VHS copy of the film has this score on part 1 and regardless of the enhanced quality of the image on the DVD, the film is slower and more confusing with the new music and definitely not as much fun to watch. My new DVD also breaks up alot (my other discs do not) so there may be a problem with the DVD itself.

Otherwise, this is still one of Fritz Lang's greatest silent films and the DVD does have Kalat's great commentary which, though a bit stuffy, tells you more about the origins of Dr. Mabuse and the making of the film than you'll ever find out without doing a ton of research. It's interesting to hear that there is another, more complete version available in Europe: too bad we in America are at the mercy of the Region 1 and 2 debacle. Why can't the whole world used the same standard for DVD's so we could all get the benefit of the global marketplace and see the best possible version of the film instead of wasting almost $40 on one we may have to replace next week, if not next year?",1104537600,14,2097,4.374358974358974
1623727,4,B00005M2CC,I was hoping it'd be scarier. The only times I thought it scary was when Count Told saw images of himself chasing after him. Film gets better on repeat viewings and the commentary is good and informative.,1100908800,,204,4.54054054054054
1623728,4,B00005M2CC,"As of June 2004 you need to wait and think before you buy this DVD.  In it's favour it has a fantastic commentary by David Kalat.  Against it, it's not a complete version.  It WAS the most complete available, but now a region 2 release by Eureka contains the whole film, complete and restored.",1087516800,43,293,4.388888888888889
1623729,5,B00005M2CC,"I am became interested in this film largely because of its director Fritz Lang. I had always enjoyed Metropolis (I now own the Kino release which is nothing short of breath taking in the quality). I began to read about the evil doctor and I was hooked by the concept of the narrative. So dark and given its timing so right in the context of a Weimar Germany.
I must admit that slient films require the viewer to see the film from a different context as compared to modern cinema. However, if one makes that adjustment the rewards are worth it.
Many of the other reviews do an excellent job of discussing the plot and the like so in the context I will not go into any detail other than to say it may well in total be a 4 hour experience but it DOES NOT feel like it. This is one of my favourite pieces of cinema. I think much of garbage coming out of Hollywood could learn much from a thriller such as this.
David Kalat's narration is fantastic, and so are the other Mabuse films he has reviewed. Like all great teachers you never feel as if you are being educated but being entertained.
Bravo on the DVD and Bravo to David.",1066521600,11,1123,4.227906976744186
1623730,5,B00005M2CC,"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler is a must-have for any film scholar. It is one of Lang's best works, and it's hard to understand why this film is so little-known while the flashy but leaden Metropolis is considered a classic.
Sergei Eisenstein was an admirer of Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, and supposedly he obtained a copy and studied its construction. I can only assume that the picture had a influence on other filmmakers around the world; it has a much more modern feel than any film I've seen from the early 20s. The pace is quick (at least in the first part), the cross-cutting between scenes is sophisticated, there is great attention to detail in the sets, and it rarely has the ""stagy"" feel that many silent films suffer from. If one had to point to one element that puts it ahead of its time, it would be its overall construction--the way the various shots and scenes are put together to create the story. Dr. Mabuse the Gambler creates a sense of both time and space; many things happen simultaneously in the movie-world, and the locales we see are not two-dimensional stage sets but rather three-dimensional spaces where we peer around corners and follow the characters from one room to the next. The only silent filmmaker I can think of who lavished so much attention on creating a credible world is Erich von Stroheim, though one could argue that that filmmaker should have taken a lesson from the economy of Lang's storytelling.
In addition to its status as a landmark film, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler is also truly entertaining, particularly the first part. There are car and train chases, riotous gambling dens, memorable bit characters, and some great special effects. The basic story of good versus evil is compelling. Dr. Mabuse is one of the screen's greatest villains, a shrewd megalomaniac who seems to be tormented and driven by his overpowering desires. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is truly fantastic in the part. Mabuse revels insanely at his conquests and explodes with fury when he is thwarted. However, though he is extreme, he is no cartoon supervillain or two-dimensional monster; he is a fallible character, not evil itself but rather human evil, and this is what makes him exciting.
The quality of the DVD is good to fair. I was thrilled with the clarity and felt that Image had done a superb job, but those who expect every title on DVD to be as crystal-clear as a movie that was released last year will be disappointed. This is not a perfectly restored copy; there are little imperfections in the film, from scratches to missing frames. There are even some very minor shots missing--for example, the very first shot of the seance scene shows the circle of hands from above, and this is missing from the DVD version. However, this is the most extreme case that I noted. In all cases the missing scraps do not affect the film as a whole; it is just that there are moments where you might think that Lang had a poor sense of continuity (and this is not the case!). Another oddity about the copy is that at least one of the shots differs slightly from that on a copy I have on videotape. There is a scene on the DVD where von Wenk is speaking to Carozza in the prison, and the shot shows all of the two characters. On the videotape I have, the shot is a close-up from a slightly different angle. I have had the same experience with another film, The Last Laugh. On two different videotapes the same shot differs slightly.
All this being said, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD. One must take into account that the film is from 1922 and is not very well-known. It is not a beloved classic that someone is going to lavish a small fortune into restoring to perfection. Note too that this is a movie that was not previously available on any format, period. There was one mail-order company that offered a home-made version on video, but the quality was poor at best and unwatchable at worst. It was like trying to watch the movie through a bowl of soup.
Of particular note is that on the new DVD the film image has been shrunk so that it does not fill all of the available space of the television. This is because the aspect ratio of silent films was more square than the familiar 1:33 to 1 of the television set; sometimes leading to the tops of heads being cropped out when silents are transferred to video. This problem is solved on the DVD of Mabuse. And, of course, the DVD shows the movie at the correct speed. I totally disagree with the reviewer who said that it seemed speeded-up. Some of the chase scenes seem a little faster than normal speed, but I think that this was a device of Lang's rather than an imperfection of the DVD. There is also a commentary by a Mabuse scholar which, judging from the little I heard, is very well-informed.
As a side note, Fritz Lang's sequel to Mabuse, 1933's The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (the original German version is available only on video), is also very entertaining, and it features Lohmann, the detective from M! However, The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse from the sixties (Lang's last film, I believe) is unfortunately quite forgettable and I cannot recommend it.",1009497600,84,5108,4.6019736842105265
1623731,4,B00005M2CC,"There is no need to repeat that this is a superb film. It is, for me, the best silent film currently available on DVD.  And the quality of the picture is very good.  It is not, however, perfect, and I will admit to being a bit disappointed. No doubt there are no longer any 'perfect' prints of Dr Mabuse in existence, but I was disappointed that the print quality was not a little better.  It is nowhere near as good as 1000 Eyes of Dr Mabuse as far as print quality goes (of course, its an older film, but it is also more important and did receive a theatrical release in the 60s).  Moreover, although the package promises that it is shown at the 'correct speed' I think it was too fast.  It definitely has that speeded up 'silent movie' look that you get when you project a silent film at sound film speeds.  I would have slowed it down by a couple more frames per second.  Nonetheless, do not hesitate to buy this DVD -- perhaps one day there will be a better one but this is WELL worth the cost.
The commentary is terrific.",999302400,11,1027,4.209183673469388
1623732,5,B00005M2CC,"One of the most famous master criminal in history (fictional, of course), the shadow of Dr. Mabuse still lurks around this world; today, maybe more than ever. It's because of the way Fritz Lang shows... not really that he creates, but he depicts the contemporary world for him, which has a striking similarity to the contemporary world that we live in: the modern civilization of multi-media communications, of information and currency as the only real commodities. A world of false information, disguised identities, with everything having dual or triple meanings, a world seemingly civilized but full of lies and conspiracies underneath.
Lang called this two-part crime epic ""A Picture of the Times"" and ""A Play about People of Our Time"". At the center of it; Berlin 1922, this chaotic corrupted metropolis is Dr. Mabuse, psychologist, hypnotist, psychoanalyst, card shark, counterfeiter, and master criminal. His aim: not money, but to subvert everything that makes this hypocritical society works and take over. He is the logical consequence of the universe he exists in or maybe, so was Hitler. Fritz Lang would make a sequel, THE TESTAMENT OF DR.MABUSE in 1932, just before the Hitler would take power. The Nazis clearly saw the insinuation, banned the film, and Lang would eventually fly to Paris and then to Hollywood.
The modernity of Dr. Mabuse is that he knows exactly what our society today is all about, and how to destroy its seeming order. At the beginning, Mabuse masterminds a series of crimes that would lead to the collapse of the stock exchange market. We are reminded of what's a stock exchange exactly? Yes, gambling. Our economy is about manipulating information and cheating, get ahead of everybody else to win more currency. Even money is not what that really matter, it's just a question of comparison (Mabuse produces counterfeit money and the economic inflation was insane in Germany back then), and not money itself but the manipulation of it creates wealth in modern economy. Mabuse (and Lang, too) is completely aware of this.
With this new restoration that revives the stunning realistic imagery that Lang created with cinematographer Carl Hoffman, the curse of Dr. Mabuse lurks back to our collective psyche. The picture of Langs time has now became the mirror image of our world today. Mirror image, for this film, and I don't know if Lang had predicted that or whatever, is structured to be two mirrors facing each other, a symmetrical composition of time line, with the two parts reflecting each other. As the film is now almost back to it original length (still a few shots missing, but probably lost for ever), we clearly see that mirroring structure, filled with Lang's masterful editing narrative. One fine example: at the beginning, Mabuse looks at his watch, at that moment Lang cuts to some of his men robbing a train and stealing an important contract. Boom, cut to the stock market; the loss of that contract starts to incite a panic. All these causes and results, the way information are transmited with their meanings amplified, all that are so effectively expressed in a very restricted time frame. For contemporary viewers, Mabuse and Lang expert David Kulat (author of THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.MABUSE) provides an inspiring audio commentary; about Lang, about the novelist Jacques Nobert who wrote the original story, and what kind of time this film was made in. Its cultural, social, and especially political background, all that are reflected in this masterpiece. I n fact, when you see all the implications, the film becomes a bit too scary perhaps...",999043200,6,3602,5.035175879396985
1623733,5,B00005M2CC,"David Shepherd has don a favor for film fans by bringing us the most complete version of Dr Mabuse The Gambler yet available. The visual quality is clean and sharp, and Robert Israel's score is appropriate to the action and to the era. The audio commentary is useul, interesting and well read- and best of all it does not lose track of the film. While the flaws of the film still remain,(long sequences of people talking, and a few way over the top performances,) the great action sequences and eye-popping set and production design make this a memorable film.

UPDATE: The Kino edition is better in several ways: It has better picture quality and inclides two sequences missing from this edition- the film makes more sense. On the downside it lacks David Kalat's commentary and the Zimmerman score is (to my thinking) not as good as the Israel score. Real silent film fans should buy both.",998956800,6,890,4.705128205128205
1623734,5,B00005M2CC,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD
What separates film noir from the standard crime or gangster film? Psychology. Where the common criminal is simply interested in money, the film noir villain has a profound understanding of human nature and enjoys playing with the lives of others as much for pleasure as for gain.
The year is 1922. The place is post WW I Germany. It was a time of inflation so great and so accelerated that a loaf of bread costing a mere 20 thousand marks in the morning could be priced at 5 million marks by evening. Restaurant prices skyrocketed while diners were eating. Businesses paid their workers twice a day so their money would have some buying power. By November of 1923, it took 4.2 trillion German marks to buy a single American dollar. Moral chaos ensued.
To set the amoral mood of DR. MABUSE, people are shown climbing the ladder of success by exploiting the vices of others. But no value judgments are made. We see only that vice is profitable, not that it is wrong or right. The economic instability of the period gives rise to extraordinary moral decadence: a dancer performs a stage show with blatant sexual imagery; drug addicts are everyday characters, and prostitute children are openly soliciting in the streets. It's indicative of this film's milieu that even the good characters are allowed to enjoy Schadenfreude-----------pleasure at the misfortunes of others. The Countess Tolst, for instance, enjoys watching the faces of gamblers when they lose at cards------showing that even angels  become devils when they live in the hell of social chaos.
The German people of 1922 needed a savior to believe in. But he didn't have to have wings and a halo. He could be a criminal mastermind. Dr. Mabuse is such a man. He has no compassion, no mercy, no friends------------no equals-------only servants. He's professor Moriarty and the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu rolled into one. He isn't simply a mastermind who sits in a sterile room directing his criminal activities; he's also a master of disguise who enjoys becoming a different person to commit his crimes. His cohorts are so dedicated to him that they willingly sacrifice their lives--------some by suicide----------so that he can continue his great work. He is convinced of his mental and psychic gifts and lesser humans are only toys for the various games he plays. But like a child, he's unaware that any harm can come to him and is unprepared for police commissioner Von Wenk to be as ruthless and as merciless as he is.
The film is filled with noir moments: One of the crisises of the film comes during the card game between Mabuse and Commissioner Von Wenk, when both men are heavily disguised. Mabuse tries to psychically overpower Wenk's mind and in a highly cinematic noir moment, the room totally darkens, obscuring everyone but them to emphasize the contest of wills. Another highly symbolic noir moment comes when Count Tolst-------who is socially disgraced because Mabuse hypnotized him into cheating at cards------------walks from the shadows, a defeated man, toward Mabuse, standing in a bright beam of light, symbolic of the German people's yearning for a savior. Still another is when Countess Tolst pretends to be arrested and is thrown into the same prison cell as Cara Carrozza, to get information on the man Von Wenk calls ""The Great Unknown."" Cara tells her of Mabuse's greatness and of her love for him, causing the Countess to admire her for protecting the man she loves. The noir moment comes when Cara sits alone in her cell---------wondering if Mabuse has betrayed her-----------the shadow of the prison bars shine on her face and we realize she is not only in a physical prison, but an emotional prison of Mabuse's making.
It's not difficult to see DR. MABUSE as the first film noir, and one of the finest films of the German silent period. Definitely a film of its time, it could have predicted the rise of Adolph Hitler had anyone been paying attention.
The message of the film is that theft and murder in pursuit of a great cause are permissible, but that cheating is dishonorable and will be punished by fate. Mabuse is a gambler who played with life. He lost because he committed a gambler's only sin. He cheated, and his punishment is to be haunted by the ghosts of his own misdeeds.
Originally, a two part film running nearly three and a half hours, but mostly seen in a highly edited version of half that length. While I haven't seen the upcoming Image DVD and can't comment on its picture and sound quality, it restores the film back to its original length and adds a music track. It's a film every student of cinema should see, especially if you enjoy film noir.

1623736,5,B00005M2CC,"This is an outstanding release of Fritz Lang's 1922 silent classic, Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler. Eureka have done a great job with the remastering. The picture is pin-sharp and comes with a highly effective 2001 musical accompaniment by Aljoscha Zimmermann. Only four musicians are deployed, but the theme and variation scoring works brilliantly as we see (and hear) the title character metamorphose into a miriad of different disguises. The only caveat is that this DVD is now also available as re-released by Masters of Cinema in a complete Mabuse package which also contains the later The Testament of Dr. Mabuse and The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. There is no reason to think the mastering is different, but all films in the package do come with commentaries by David Kalat. The version under review lacks a commentary, which is a shame as the circumstances of the making of the film are somewhat complicated and need explaining to a modern audience not well versed in the history of the Weimar Republic. It does come with an illustrated documentary which is good on the music, but less thorough on the historical background. In fact it comes over as more of a plug for other Eureka releases of films from this period. I shouldn't grumble though as I only paid a fiver, making the DVD great value and a must-buy for those not wanting to go to the expense of getting the complete package.

Before I get into the film proper I'd like to attempt an explanation of some of the background missing in the presentation of this DVD. The key to understanding Dr. Mabuse is to pay attention to the titles of the two parts of the film. Part I is entitled Der grosse Spieler - ein Bild der Zeit (The Great Gambler - A Picture of the Time. Part II is Inferno: Ein Spiel von Menschen unserer Zeit (Inferno: A Play About People of our Times). When audiences first saw the film in Germany in 1922 they were shocked and enthralled to see a direct reflection of what surrounded them - ""A mirror of the age"" screamed the newspaper Das Tagebuch, ""A Document of our time"" proclaimed Die Welt am Montag. The film hit a nerve and as a result became legend. Germany at this time was a deeply divided society. They had lost the war in 1918 due to the collapse of the home front and there was a lot of bitter resentment against whoever would step into the power vacuum left in the wake of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Those on the extreme left wanted a Soviet Republic proclaimed. The Spartacists' revolt was put down in 1919 and Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg became martyrs to the communist cause forever after. A separate Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed in Munich only to be put down by the far right Freikorps. The far right were of course embittered as they had to surrender the war while German troops were still on French and Belgian soil. They felt nothing but disgust for those 'traitors' involved in the November Revolution which saw the transition of German society from Wilhelminism (society as organized under the Emporer) to a republic under President Friedrich Ebert. The statutes of the republic were drawn up in Weimar and it paved the way for a decade of instability with the Kapp-Luttwitz Putsch of 1920 and the Munich Beerhall Putsch of 1923 just two examples of the politico-economic instability which led eventually to Hitler seizing power in 1933.

The years 1919-1923 were the crisis years and it is this period which forms the background to (even to some extent the subject of) Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler. It was a time of extreme wealth and extreme poverty existing alongside extreme excitement and extreme gloom. It's no exaggeration to describe society as manic-depressive during this time. The German economy was in a ruinous state which led to wild speculation on the stock exchange and hyper-inflation as the mark dwindled in value. In 1919 a loaf of bread cost 1 mark. By 1923 the same loaf cost 100 billion marks. The fact that a day's wages could disappear overnight due to inflation led to many trying to spend everything they earned on a daily basis, living hand-to-mouth existences. All of this is faithfully caught in Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang's Mabuse script. The first act of part I sees Mabuse engineer the theft of an important document which delays information from reaching the stock exchange so that he can manipulate the prices, buying and then selling for a huge profit. The sequence ends with the face of Mabuse super-imposed over the empty exchange floor, in Tom Wolfe's term, a Master of the Universe. The day-to-day manic-depressive frivolity of the Weimar Republic is depicted by numerous scenes showing night-clubs, gambling dens, drinking establishments, dance halls, magic shows and exhibitions of mesmerism, hypnosis, illusionism, and of course movies just like Dr. Mabuse itself. Dr. Mabuse moves through this crazy urban euphoria and scores where he can, when he can. Lang shows the essence of this fragility in the status of the rich and the poor by the short film within a film showing Herr. Schramm (Julius E. Herrmann) transformed overnight from street vagrant to restauranteur thanks to a loan from a Jewish money lender. The Weimar vulgarity is exaggerated to point out the sickness that lies behind the society which of course is fuelled (and to an extent symbolised) by the Mabuse character himself.

The time's hyper-inflation is dealt with in the sequences depicting Mabuse's counterfeiting operation. Just like the Weimar government, he makes money by literally making it himself. The film's final section has Mabuse going crazy clutching at all his forged bank bills and promissary notes in a manner many audiences would have associated with the Ebert administration. The picture Lang paints in the film was so accurate that there is even the feeling that he is predicting events to come. On June 24, 1922, Jewish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walther Rathenau was assassinated by a right wing group in similar fashion to the government minister in the train at the beginning of the film. At the end of the film one of Mabuse's henchmen writes ""Gotz von Berlichingen"" on his cell wall before topping himself. This is a reference to a medieval nobleman who sided with peasants in Goethe's play of the same name and for audiences in 1923 a possible reference to Hitler's stay in Landesburg prison following the 1923 Munich Putsch. Siegfried Kracauer in his book, From Caligari to Hitler, makes his central argument the idea that many of the 'Expressionist' films of the 20s were in fact premonitions of the rise of Hitler and that Mabuse was probably the best example of this after Caligari himself in Robert Wiene's 1919 horror film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

Dr. Mabuse is a master of disguise and in the film he appears as many characters. This suggests to me that Lang was making Mabuse into a metaphor for Weimar society itself. All the characters represent different types which audiences would have recognized - he's variously a gentleman of the stock exchange, a Russian diplomat, a drunken sailor, a Dutch professor, an English gentleman of leisure, a professional gambler, a Jewish street vendor, a psychoanalyst, the conjuror Sandor Weltmann, and finally, basically a common Al Capone-like gangster. He is Lang's first great Master Criminal and he is also the Weimar Republic itself. Central to the main story of the chase between Mabuse and Detective von Wenk is Mabuse's use and abuse of Count and Countess Told. They represent the old upper class Junker tradition, a tradition that is depicted as lazy and slothful, and which lays itself wide open for unscrupulous operators to exploit. Following Kracauer I'd like to suggest that this prefigures the way Hitler insinuated himself into the upper echelons of German society to gain power. Harbou and Lang as early as 1921 (when the script was written) were able to pinpoint the central flaw in German society which would lead the country eventually into the abyss.

Also part of the times in Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler was Lang's use of Expressionism. It's important to realize that Expressionism had been restricted during World War I to operating only within German borders. During that time Hollywood had claimed clear leadership of world cinema. In the immediate post-war period with the mark's devaluation, the making of films became cheaper, and inspired producers like Erich Pommer saw that to gain a foothold back in the industry, German cinema had to offer something different. That difference was German Expressionism. It fed especially into The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a film that was very successful in the States. Pommer had originally asked Lang to direct Caligari, but he was too busy on Die Spinnen at the time. They eventually agreed to make a Zeitbild (a Picture of the Times) with the same techniques. This became Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler. In the film Expressionism is much more than just a clever marketing ploy however. The themes that fed this strand of the modernist movement were central to both the film Lang was planning and (I'd say) to the whole of Lang's cinema, extending forewards throughout the later American phase of his career. Central to Expressionism is a conflict between the backwards view to the Romanticism of E. T. A. Hoffman and Goethe and the forwards view towards visual expression of one's inner mental state. Therefore in both Caligari and Mabuse you have very clear logical storylines which look backwards, but you also have a fierce illogical presentation (in both mise-en-scene and the acting) which clashes as a consequence. It is this clashing which is the most exciting aspect of cinematic Expressionism. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari deploys a series of bizarre sets which on first view don't seem to have anything to do with the story. Mabuse's sets are much more traditional, but this was because Lang was going for a depiction of the times and had to keep the setting recognisably 'Germany' rather than going for abstraction. Expressionism is felt in the constant jarring between dull, cramped exteriors to buildings which open into unlikely wide spaces where people dance, gamble and drink. The designs, especially perhaps Schramm's restaurant and the Tolds' home is full of Expressionist painting and sculptures. Dark street scenes such as Hull's assassination and the shooting of one of Mabuse's henchmen in the prison wagon have the flavour of Georges Grosz or Ludwig Kirchner. The night scene where Told goes mad is especially Expressionistic with ghosts materializing before him to drive him crazy. Madness is central to Expressionism, not only with Told but also with Mabuse himself who ends up as deranged as Stephen at the end of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. There's even a scene where von Wenk (rendered temporarily mad by Mabuse) chases the mysterious word 'Melior' across the screen in the same manner as Caligari chases his name across the screen. Characters are motivated by their inner desires which are made visual by the simple device of super-imposing words on the screen around them - pure Expressionism. Central behind Lang's use of Expressionism is the idea that Weimar society may have been rather jolly on the surface with people enjoying drinking, eating, dancing and gambling, but underlying everything was people's fear of authority, gloomy paranoia, and disquiet caused by a dirth of central power in society. The feeling was one of intense angst which at the least little jolt could rise and threaten social chaos - such was the nature of both Expressionism and the Weimar Republic. And such was also the nature of Lang's cinema. All his most personal films posit a seemingly calm surface undercut by a neurotic (usually urban) angst-ridden complexity which threatens at any given moment. Expressionism was a perfect match not only for the Weimar society that nurtured it, but also for Lang's cinematic universe.

With an understanding of Weimar history and some knowledge of Modernism (specifically Expressionism) Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler becomes a fascinating experience. What takes the film even beyond that is the way Lang outlines virtually all his thematic obsessions which were to haunt the rest of his work. First of all, the film marks the birth of the urban thriller. There had been important precursors in the work of Louis Feuillade (in Fantomas and Les Vampires) and in Lang himself (in Die Spinnen), but Dr. Mabuse was by far the most sophisticated statement of the genre to date. Through Metropolis, Spione, M, Fury, The Woman in the Window, Scarlet Street, The Big Heat and to his final films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, Lang would refine and redefine his view of society through the context of urban modernity. Tom Gunning in his excellent book, The Films of Fritz Lang: Allegories of Vision and Modernity argues persuasively that Lang viewed modernity as a pattern of interlocking systems which feed one another. These systems overlook and control mankind to the extent that in a Lang picture the protagonist is never in charge of his own fate. He is always locked into a 'destiny machine' which determines his direction. All of Lang's films show characters trapped by powers that lie beyond their control so that fate, paranoia and the threat of surveillance is never far away. Mabuse starts the film seemingly in control of his fate. The killing of the minister and the stealing of the information which will influence prices on the stock exchange is depicted by Lang with several layers of technology working together (the pocket watch, the train, the car, the telephone wire) with Mabuse at the center of everything, controling to the point where he himself is seen as one of the technologies. Mabuse is locked in a machine destined to make him not only rich, but also all-powerful. When von Wenk finally makes the connection between the conjuror Weltman, the gambler who had earlier tricked him and the psychoanalyst Mabuse, this jolt in the workings of the interlocking systems of modernity results in Mabuse's demise. The destiny machine (now controled by the police detective von Wenk) grinds on to the inevitable conclusion. In all Lang's most personal films (Spione, M, You Only Live Once, The Woman in the Window, Scarlet Street and The Big Heat) the same thing happens. One jolt in the mechanism and that's it for all the protagonists concerned.

Dr. Mabuse also marks the first really sophisticated statement of the Master Detective/Master Criminal chase scenario which became a Lang constant hereafter. In Dr. Mabuse, the detective is the man who knows best how to work the (in Gunning's term) 'terrain of modernity'. He has knowledge of causal reasoning, penetration into the metropolis, exploitation of disguise and the blurry boundaries of personal and social identity, scrutiny of the smallest clues, and supreme control over surveillance. In Lang's world the detective is supreme master. The Master Criminal of course is his doppelganger, the dark flipside without which the detective wouldn't exist in the first place. This duality between polarities informs all of Lang's best work. Added to the Mabuse/von Wenk dialectic we also have the Mabuse/Lang dialectic as well. For throughout all Lang's work there is a constant commentary on the role of the director in the movie. We are always aware we are watching an artificial construct which is the movie itself which frames reality through the male gaze. This obsession with framing and ways of seeing reached its ultimate expression in The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street.

The last theme that I want to mention (there is just so much more than can be said, but I haven't got the space here) is that splendidly Langian sense of ambiguity which we associate with all his best work. There is a constant doubling of characters throughout, but (with the exception of Lang's American wartime propaganda efforts) there is no sense in which one man can be seen as totally 'good' and another as totally 'bad'. Lang was fully aware of the complexity of human nature to the point where characters are not allowed to be pigeon-holed. Mabuse is termed a master criminal, but he is sympathetic to a degree. He is created by circumstances beyond his control. It was World War I, the Treaty of Versailles and the power vacuum existing at the center of the Weimar Republic that created him. Also, the behaviour of Detective von Wenk (representing the 'good' side of law and order) subtly echoes and mirrors Mabuse. He too resorts to disguises to find his man, and (key to the plot) he is never beyond using others to get what he wants. Just as Mabuse uses Carozza to get at Hull, so von Wenk uses Countess Told to get at Carozza. The scenes of the film play out as each man (opposite halves of the society they embody) circle and plot around their respective desks. The film's final scene shows 'what used to be Dr. Mabuse' as a poor, pathetic creature evoking of our pity. He is not a monster after all, rather he is just a sad sorry sign of the times. This delicious ambiguity was to be polished even more in M and would extend forward to almost all of Lang's main protagonists who are trapped by circumstances beyond their control.

Finally then, beyond all the disguises, who is Mabuse? It's very easy to say he represents the Weimar Republic, but the ambiguity around him means we can 'read' him in a number of different ways. Take what he says at the end of the first part where he has just forced Told to cheat at cards and is about to carry away Told's wife. He says: 'There is only one thing that is interesting any more. Playing with people and the destinies of people.' He then goes on: 'There is no such thing as love - there is only desire - There is no fortune, only the Will-to-power'. This directly invokes the idea of Mabuse being a Nietzschean Ubermensch (Superman) - Lang's own professed reading of the character (he also later said he saw Mabuse as a kind of Al Capone). Certainly the notion of a will to power in a powerless Weimar Republic state is an intriguing one. Erich Pommer saw Mabuse as a Spartacist in an on-going war against the Liberals in 1920's Germany. Rudolf Klein-Rogge (Mabuse himself) saw Mabuse as 'a symptom of a Europe that was falling apart...a guiding force, a creator, if only in destruction'. I think Lang deliberately holds back from offering a concrete definition of Mabuse because he wanted his audiences to think and draw conclusions for and (because the film is a Zeitbild) about themselves. Such was the measure of the artist. If Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler has a fault, it lies within it's nature as a Zeitbild. Modern viewers have to make an effort to engage with the history of the times and 'decode' the film to really get into it. Its close concern with the Weimar Rebublic means that the film finally lacks the universality which Spione and M both pack in abundance. It's still an awesome work of art, one which repays close attention by all lovers of cinema and one which offers a virtual primer for understanding the rest of this formidable director's work.

1623744,4,B00005M2CC,"Fritz Lang's classic of the criminal mastermind Dr Mabuse is a reflection of the decadence of post world war I Berlin.  Dr Mabuse would go on to become the archetype criminal mastermind in German crime fiction.  Lang's sequel in 1933 (The Testament of Dr Mabuse)  was widely considered an allegory of the nascent Nazi regime and would soon be banned by the Nazi's.  Whether Goebbel's offer to Lang to become head of the Nazi Cinema Institute was a ruse in order to ultimately have him imprisoned and/or ultimately murdered is not known for sure.  But Lang's anti Nazi attitudes and his Jewish mother caused him the flee Germany shortly after the Goebbel's offer.

Actually, in 1960, Lang returned to Germany to direct a second official sequel called ""The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse (Der Tousend Augen Des Dr Mabuse)

As to the specific film at hand, Dr Mabuse the Gambler (Dr Mabuse, Der Spieler) is almost 5 hours long and was originally meant to be viewed in two parts---on successive evenings.  (In the DVD package, each half is on a separate disc).  As with any foreign language film, it takes a lot of concentration to keep up with the subtitles (in this case, inter title cards as it is a silent film), so the watching of this marvelous film can be somewhat tedious.  Nevertheless, it is a masterpiece.  There is one disappointment.  As mentioned by another reviewer, there was a different music score developed for this film when it was first shown by Janus films in the 1960s.  German composer Konrad Elfers developed a Jazz Age score which is indeed more coherent than the score that you hear on this current release.  This current score is very dissonant and is not particularly enjoyable to listen to.  It's a shame that the Elfer's score isn't offered as an option.

1623757,5,B00005M2CC,"It is interesting to discover or rediscover Fritz Lang. He was well known for one film, Metropolis, and then for a few American films, films he shot in the USA. But the full set of Dr Mabuse's films is fascinating in a way because it provides a rare vision on the German cinema from the early 1920s to 1960. The eye looking at the world from a German point of view that spans over Hitler, Nazism and the Second World War is Fritz Lang's. We know him for his highly symbolical Metropolis in which the meaning is built by visual and numerical symbols. In this Dr Mabuse it is different. There are quite a lot of symbols but inherited from the silent cinema of the old days, symbols that are there only to make clear a situation that had been depicted previously with pictures and no words, or a page of intertitles. Fritz Lang still uses that technique in his 1960 film, which is a long time overdue for a silent cinema technique. But that is a style, nothing but a way of speaking, not a meaning. The meaning is absolutely bizarre. Dr Mabuse is a highly criminal person but his objective is not to commit crimes in order to get richer or whatever. It is to control the world through his criminal activity. The world is seen as basically negative, leading to chaos and overexploitation, leading to anarchistic crime and nothing else because the only objective of this modern world is to make a profit by all means available. Dr Mabuse is a master mind of his time and for him crime is the only way to destroy that capitalistic world that he never calls capitalistic or Kapitalismus and to replace it with pure chaos that should be able to bring a regeneration, a rejuvenating epiphany, a re-founding experience. We find in his mind what we could find in some of the most important criminal minds in this world, like Carlos in France, or Charles Manson in the USA, or those sects that practice mass suicide in order to liberate the suicidees and to warn the world about the coming apocalypse. It is the mind and thinking of those who practice war as a revolutionary activity with a fundamentalist vision of their religions or politics and the world that is supposed to reflect that religion. They do not want to build a different society and when they are in power they are constantly aiming at antagonizing their own population and the world because they cannot exist if they do not feel some opposition that they can negate, bring down, crush, like in Iran, or in Germany with Hitler, though later on it was not much different under the Communists in  East Germany. These visions need opposition to exist and they provoke that opposition by aiming at taking the control of the world with violence and imposing their control with more violence. That's Dr Mabuse, the main brain of a criminal decomposition and re-composition of society on an absolutely antagonistic vision of life. But that vision is very common. Just as common as this phrase ""a half full glass is nothing but a half empty glass"". Add antagonism to that dual vision and then you have a struggle to the death between the half empty glass that wants to be full and the half full glass that wants to be empty (or full?), one half only wanting to take what the other half has and impose his half to the other half to make the world one by the elimination of the other side of the coin. That dual antagonistic vision is the popular and shrivelled up approach of the communist catechism of Stalin, inherited from Marx's French son in law Paul Lafargue, or of course in all dictatorship that reduces life to a little red book, to one hundred quotations from the master thinker of the revolution. That's the world you feel in these films. Fritz Lang embodies this ideology of the mentally poor in that criminal character of his: kill, rob, steal, counterfeit. Even if you die when doing so, the world will change and remember. The master criminal has to die in his activity in order to regenerate the world. What Fritz Lang introduced in his double main feature of the early 1920s and in his Testament, is that the master brain of this vision internalizes this paranoid and psychotic vision of the world into himself and has to become psychotic himself and it is in his psychosis that he finds the energy to conquer the world again. In the third film, Dr Mabuse has been dead for a long time and is reincarnated by someone who finds his inspiration in the doctor. That is a far-fetched cinematographic and fictional antic that is necessary as a reference but brings nothing to the vision itself. A few years later that ideology was to conquer our imagination in many ways. First the Berlin Wall became the symbol of that vision the way it was carried and conveyed to the world by the East-German communists. Then we have to think of the various revolutionary movements like Der Baader Meinhof Komplex, Die Rote Armee Fraktion, to take some German examples. But think of the French Mesrine and the Italian revolutionary urban guerilla warfare movements and you will have a fair picture of this psychotic criminal mind copied and pasted into the political field. The Maoist Red Guard and Cultural Revolution movement was quite typical of this approach. All that was going to come in 1960 and we must admit Fritz Lang was seeing ahead of his time, just as he had seen Hitler in his Testament of Dr Mabuse: a political leader based on hypnosis and mesmerizing people into blindly following a band of criminals.

Klein-Rogge is amazing as the malevolent master criminal, a calculating opponent seized with hubris and a penchant for clever disguises.

Mabuse represents the reincarnation of Faust in a decaying environment, where power is the reason for living and the perfect substitute for happiness. That's why the final is so admirably metaphorical when he escapes via the sewer tunnels.

1623762,5,B00005M2CC,"Fritz Lang's brilliantly directed and designed DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER (1922,  Germany) is one of the crowning achievements of the German silent cinema from the decade following World War One.  And Kino Video in Manhattan has given it a magnificent restoration that runs a full four-and-a-half hours.  The print is beautiful, way longer than previous versions on home video, and with an evocatively harsh piano and violin score by Aljoscha Zimmermann and ensemble.

Dr. Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) is the archetype of all master criminals in a century of espionage movies, from James Bond to Alfred Hitchcock.  He is a master of many disguises and is forever masterminding all means of terrorism in early 1920's Berlin.  In this respect, DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER is very timely and contemporary.

In a movie that is also a commentary on 1920's Germany living, Mabuse works out of (or frequents) a cabaret with a gambling table that vanishes quickly in case of a police raid, and that offers cocaine for the mere asking.  One wonders whether the cast and crew of Bob Fosse's CABARET  (1972) saw this movie.  Thea von Harbou's adaptation of Norbert Jacques' novel keeps the action moving quickly, despite the mammoth length.  Something is always blowing up, and Mabuse is forever in another disguise to elude the police.

Actually, the 270 minute length is an asset because continuity holes have been filled in.  We have two separate movies with an intermission for easy two night viewing on home video.  (The intermission is at the two-and-a-half hour mark)  The cinematography is by Carl Hoffmann, while the wondrous art direction is by Otto Hunte and Carl Stahl-Urach.  Other cast members include METROPOLIS' Alfred Abel, Bernardt  Goetzke, Aud Egede Nissen, and Paul Richter.

DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER is the grandfather of all espionage movies and cannot be recommended highly enough to fans of this genre.  In its Kino Video restoration (which actually is a Berlin-Munich-Moscow restoration with Kino as American distributor), the movie is a stupendous achievement even by today's achievements.

7944616,3,B00005M2CC,"Dr. Mabuse, The Gambler,"" directed by Fritz Lang, was made in 1922 at the height of German expressionism in cinema. Based on a character created by Norbert Jacques, the film was originally released in two parts. At 270 minutes, the Kino edition  the most complete one on home video formats  combines the two.

The film opens with Dr. Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) using his talents for disguise and hypnotism to carry out a plan to manipulate the stock market. Next, he targets Hull (Paul Richter), a playboy and gambler, for his access to an exclusive club, where Mabuse uses hypnosis to cheat and win at cards. Police Inspector von Wenk (Bernhard Goetzke) becomes intrigued with Hulls case and an involved, methodical investigation and match-up of wits follow.

Though the film often rambles, it has some stand-out moments and features an early template for such villains as the title character in The Mask of Fu Manchu, Agent Smith of The Matrix, The Joker in Batman, and various James Bond bad guys. Mabuse hides behind the veneer of a respected psychoanalyst, but secretly is a master criminal, whos no match for the slow, outdated methods of the local police. He targets whatever milieu offers rewards, whether lurid gambling dens, seedy hangouts, or the world of international finance.

Dr. Mabuse, The Gambler is populated with henchmen, heroes, and femmes fatales, interwoven with action sequences, and set against a backdrop of Weimar Republic decadence. The film is often considered the first film noir, long before that genres American heyday in the 1940s and 1950s.

Please make a good print, dubbed in English and they will sell. I want a good copy I can understand.

7944622,5,B00005M2CC,"The Eureka! UK Blu-ray is locked to Region B (Europe):
For those considering the Eureka! Blu-ray, it's a UK release and is locked to Region B (Europe). It will NOT play in the Region A Blu-ray players normally sold in North America. The player must be an ""All Region"" or ""Region Free"" Blu-ray player. DVD region-free isn't sufficient. It must also be Blu-ray region-free which is typically a modest additional cost option. I have a secondary region-free player I keep set to Region B just for films like this (usually from the UK) that have not been released on Blu-ray in Region A. It wasn't that expensive.

Desirability of the Eureka! UK Blu-ray:
Part 1 is 2:35 (155 min) and Part 2 is 1:56 (116 min) in length, for a 4:31 (271 min) total run time, from the Murnau Foundation restoration (more about that below). To my knowledge this is the most complete version on Blu-ray or DVD. There is a 297 minute version owned by the Goethe Institute, but as far as I know it has not been transferred to DVD or Blu-ray. Other releases, particularly the US DVDs, are considerably shorter. Among the USA released DVDs, the Kino Lorber is 242 minutes and the Image Entertainment is 229 minutes. There has not been a US or Canada Blu-ray of this movie, in any of its run lengths. The Eureka! release is the most most complete on home video, and its a 2-disc Blu-ray set. Im do not know how much more the additional 26 minutes of the Goethe Institute version enhances the story. All the necessary elements are present in the 271 minute Murnau version without any gaps, continuity problems or plot holes.

The complexity of the plot is amazing for a 1922 silent, with the intricacy of Dr. Mabuses machinations in conducting his criminal activities, concealing his identity and preventing anyone from following him. Dr. Mabuse is the German version of Moriarty, a genius master criminal with a large network of devoted minions. Gambler refers to more than just games of chance, it encompasses taking risks with everything in his life and with the lives of others around him. He is a psychoanalyst who can Mesmerize people across a room to manipulate their behavior through the power of telepathic suggestion. His criminal enterprise includes counterfeiting, manipulating the stock market, controlling casino card game player behavior, and inducing people to harm themselves or others. He is also a master of disguise and impersonation, using this skill to evade identification and being followed, and to prevent his victims, the local prosecutor and police from deducing numerous criminal acts have all been committed by the same man. While disguised as a stage performer, his playbill claims demonstration of mass suggestion, waking hypnosis, trance, natural magnetism, the secrets of Indian fakirs, the secrets of inner life and the subconscious in humans and animals.  Dr. Mabuse is the consummate, omnipotent, omnipresent gangster. He is anyone anywhere, and nobody nowhere, confounding all law enforcement efforts to gather evidence of his crimes and identify him. Following the complex Rube Goldberg type ruses he uses simply to get into his counterfeiting lair with its blind workers packaging freshly printed notes is entertainment in itself.  Throughout, there is no end of twists, turns and surprises as the number of Dr. Mabuses victims climbs and he eludes the local criminal prosecutor.  Ultimately Dr. Mabuse is unmasked. With his numerous attempts to eliminate the local prosecutor foiled and his immediate lieutenants eliminated by the authorities, he is cornered and out of escape plans. Getting from the beginning of the movie to the ultimate end of Dr. Mabuse is a labyrinth of deception with a cat and mouse pursuit keeping the local prosecutor at bay just one step behind him until the final few minutes.

Restoration used for the Eureka! UK Blu-ray:
The Murnau Foundation made considerable effort to restore this two part epic to its original full length, including correcting and reinserting all the intertitle cards. Unlike ""Metropolis"" and some other Fritz Lang silents, there was no score specifically written for this film when it was produced. The music track was composed as part of the restoration. The goal was providing period music that supported the story as it unfolded. In my opinion it was highly successful. Source material quality varies throughout with some sections showing more degradation than others. The transfer is excellent, but limited by the condition of the two negatives used in the restoration. Overall, you likely see what a movie-goer would have seen after the reels had been played a few  times, but not yet worn out. A ""wet gate"" process with fluid having the same refraction index as the film emulsion was used to do the digital scan. The result was many nicks and scratches being concealed. Grain, lighting variation and frame edge falloff are what I would expect from a B&W German silent production in the immediate post-WWI early 1920's. It looks rough compared to films made ten years later with dramatic technological improvements in all aspects of production. Most parts of the movie are not improved  much over what could be done with DVD. The source negatives do not have that level of image resolution. The value of the Blu-ray is not in a high-res rendition, its in containing the 271 minute run length and the extra features about the Dr. Mabuse character, the director, Fritz Lang, and the restoration process.

Silent Films:
Pacing will not be what you find in talking films with similar genre and subject matter. It's going to be slowed some by the necessity of inserting intertitle cards with the dialog, and even then, story pacing then wasn't what it is today. We get to savor the characters and their environs as the story unfolds. That said, the pacing, in spite of its epic length, is a little faster than most other early 1920's silents. The acting may seem high melodrama and overdone by today's standards, but was also necessary to compensate for limited dialog on the intertitles. In that regard, it's well directed and the acting physically delivers dialog that isn't on the intertitles.

Five stars for a Fritz Lang silent materpiece.",1434067200,4,6204,4.97972972972973
