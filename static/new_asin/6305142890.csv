7884273,4,6305142890,"No one celebrates the Hannukah season with TV specials--except for Shari Lewis, an adorable mix of Southern-style puppets and a tableful of latkes!

Learn the latke song--it is worth the price of the video.

This is not great art--but simple and charming and a welcome addition to holiday fare that tends to be exclusively Christian in content.

Now, who is going to create Mikvah on 34th Street?",1273968000,,396,4.880597014925373
7884274,5,6305142890,"Awesome! I have always loved Lambchop (and it's SOO sad that Sheri Lewis died-:(), and this, as a Hanukkah special, is really wonderful. Charlie-Horse uses his software gift to enter a make-your-own-superhero contest, and it is ente rtaining to see the gone-wrong 'heros' wreck havoc on the house. Hush-Puppy, as usual, is not exactly the main character, but he is in this video, wise-cracking in his one-of-a-kind voice. Lambchop and Sheri make latkes and sing together in the kitchen, and all the 'kids' anticipate the chocolate gelt. They hold their annual play (the story of Hannukah), and there are three guest stars that play Sheri's friends who attend the supper. All in all, this is an informative, cute, and over-all fun video! Please don't give it bad reviews- I love it too much.",1065744000,5,790,4.947368421052632
7884275,5,6305142890,"I'm a big fan of Lamb Chop and this Chanukah special kept the same tradition of your fav. puppet going. It will also teach your kids about what Chanukah is all about. Shari tells the stories of Chanukah and the puppets put on a play which is very interesting to watch and the meals that Shari make. One of the few things I like to add is the superheroes that Charile made, being this is the first time they put a little violence in the videos of Lamb Chop and I'm glad they dump the idea of putting violence in the other Lamb Chop videos. Overrall, it's a great video to watch for kids who love Lamb Chop and to the Jewish people who celebrate the holiday. One of the best delights for the whole family to watch.",1029369600,2,712,4.166666666666667
7884276,5,6305142890,"This video was a great way to teach my 2 year old daughter and husband about Hanukkah.  Lamb Chop and her friends kept my daughter interested, the Hanukkah play performed by Shari gave my husband a brief overview of the Holiday and we all sing the ""8 Days of Hanukkah"" together.  This tape gives my daughter the opportunity to be aware of Hanukkah during a time when children are inundated with nothing but Christmas on TV and in stores.",977097600,2,437,4.518987341772152
7884277,4,6305142890,"This video is requested year-round by our 5 year old son and 2 year old daughter.  Highlights include songs about making potato latkes and a great musical re-enactment of the Hanukah story put on by Shari and her 3 puppet  friends.
The superhero storyline can be distracting, but it serves to  illustrate the heroic qualities of Judah Maccabee.  ""Did you know that  if Syria and Israel got together they would be Cereal?"" is a typical  joke.  Great fun.",953683200,6,453,4.730769230769231
7884278,3,6305142890,"Fans of Sherry Lewis and the Lamb Chop  gang will love this Hanukkah special  (Which first aired on network TV) where  Sherry invites friends to a Hanukkah  party, Charlie Horse invents a Maccabee  super hero on his  computer, and they  all sing a song about ""The Eight Days  of  Hannukah.""
As for me, I had very mixed feelings  about it.  On the  one hand, it's always  nice for Jewish kids to see their favorite  TV  characters celebrating OUR holidays  for a change.  But on the other hand,  the costuming and some of the themes  in general were a bit  ""Christmasy"" for  my tastes. Sherry's bright red dress,  for  example, evokes ""Santa"" more than  anything Jewish.  And while  the ""Eight  Days of Hanukkah"" was a fun song (and I  found myself  humming it later), it is  clearly a knock-off of ""The 12 Days of  Christmas.""
One gets the impression that the producers  of this  show wanted to be ""inclusive"" by  making Hanukkah ""just  another Christmas  custom"" -- something that I personally  resist  doing.  Hanukkah and Christmas  have nothing in common except that they  both come in December.
So, I give it 4 stars for the idea of  having Lamb  Chop and friends be inclusive  of Jews, but only 2 stars for its lack  of  Jewish authenticity -- which averages  out to 3 stars. .",941500800,6,1283,4.547085201793722
