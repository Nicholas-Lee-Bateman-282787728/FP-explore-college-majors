Comedy and drama clash.  3*

I was led to this film seeking others featuring the excellent actress Shinobu Terajima whom I'd seen in the very indie Vibrator, so my take on it may be different from someone approaching it looking for a Hollywood-style comedy or airport drama.  Haruka Ayase, who plays Etsuko, does seem to be a popular star.

This is a cheerful and nicely lensed film that may ""fly"" better in the original culture and language, but to me it is trying to do too many things at once.  It starts out as a wacky comedy, with bumbling but winsome leads.  Then there is the aspect of a big ensemble cast from flight crew to passengers to mechanics to concourse support to flight controllers to the bird patrol whose job it is to scare away birds who might get sucked into an engine to animal rights activists confused about what he does, mostly handled with a comedic touch.  Somewhere it morphs into a taut drama about a plane with mechanical difficulties seeking to land in a typhoon.

The two main characters are a co-pilot, Kazuhiro, bucking for his pilot's wings, faced with a tough inspector on his final test flight, and flight attendant Etsuko, on her first long haul international flight, to Honolulu.  The odd thing is that these meet only in passing, if at all.  This isn't even a romantic comedy but something put forth as an ""adventure comedy.""  The initial portion of the film is straight sitcom, with Etsuko on the bus to the airport with her fellow 'stews', who warn her about the horrible cabin steward she's assigned (this turns out to be Terajima's role), while Kazuhiro has a disastrous flight simulator run, then learns the soft touch inspector he was expecting to fly with is ill.  The rest of the ensemble are also beginning their days, in their own bouncy and cute ways.  But there is the underlying tension that the company is having serious problems with their on-time record.  So when a faulty component is discovered in an engine, the pit boss doesn't want to replace it until he exacts a promise from the hapless mechanic to get it done in 6 minutes, not 8.  The comedic aspect throughout is gently slapstick ... Etsuko, for instance, taking the odd tumble or taking the pilot's preflight joke with dead seriousness as she notes it down. The running joke of the pudgy couple on their honeymoon.  Or the passenger's slipping toupee.  Nothing wrong, but nothing really incisive or hilarious either. Also, the set seemed just too clean and somehow unlived-in, more like a promo for the airline industry than an actual airport.

Then somewhere after takeoff ... and let's not mention the birds ... there is a malfunction.  (As far as I could figure out on one viewing, it was never really explained.)  The mood of the film gradually becomes less comic, and we become involved with more or less realistic detail of how the crew, both flight and ground, go about dealing with the failure, leading to an exciting climax trying to land in a typhoon (hurricane).  Some of it is a bit strained (will that cross-wind stay / go below the spec for landing? it's up, it's down, it's up,....) but perhaps not much more than typical.  Several details from the early comic half of the film are important for the playout of this dramatic half.

In summary, each part or aspect has at least something to recommend it, if neither is truly excellent.  But in spite of the plot elements that carry over from the comedic to the adventure part, the two never really mesh.  So a middle of the road 3*'s here.  If you run across it, don't run screaming, but I can't suggest going to any particular effort or expense to hunt it down.  Light entertainment for a brain-weary evening, perhaps.

Note:  Amazon claims this is an all-region DVD.  The one I got from the library, which had the same cover art and was also a Chinese pressing (if you expand the cover image you can see it is in Chinese, not Japanese, and English), was definitely a region 3 only (i.e. for China) DVD.  If ordering, and it matters to you, make sure which, or that it is returnable.

[SPOILER, sort of. You know the aphorism ""if you introduce a gun in the first act, you have to fire it in the third""?  (There are many versions, going back at least to Chekhov.)  Well, they introduced a huge hawking howitzer in the form of three geeks in the lobby checking out the flight on their laptop and mumbling about problems with it, and then some of the problems involve the onboard computers ... So I was waiting for the gun to go off and to find out that it was really all due to the geeks somehow messing up the airplane's computers.  Alas, they just vanish and are forgotten.]",1306540800,2,4703,4.582535885167464
