8228264,5,B000XHFPBE,"My kids LOVE this video! It keeps their attention the entire time. All little ones enjoy watching other children on TV, and I think that is what really draws them in. But it also has a lot of vibrant colors and great moving vehicles, which is fun for my son. More importantly, I love this video because it's so educational. Therefore, I'm more than happy to sit my kids in front of the TV to watch THE CAR VIDEO. I got this as a gift and I highly recommend it for birthdays and/or the holidays!",1195603200,2,494,4.2105263157894735
8228265,5,B000XHFPBE,"Our kids (4 yr. boy and 2 yr. girl) love this video from start to finish...and then want to watch it again! Finally a video that has all kinds of cars and trucks (and other stuff that kids love!) AND it's educational! When we go out driving they now are really attentive to their surroundings and love to count cars, name colors and tell you about traffic signs. So even when the video isn't on and in front of them, they are STILL enjoying it...and it makes car rides so much more fun! I strongly recommend buying this video to anyone who has little kids. It's also an awesome gift. I've given it to many of my sons friends as a birthday present and they all love it too! I think I'll stock up for Xmas ;)",1195084800,2,706,4.160583941605839
