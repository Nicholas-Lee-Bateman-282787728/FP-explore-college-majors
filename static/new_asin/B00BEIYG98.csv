5584538,4,B00BEIYG98,"I just took my daughter to see this on the big screen because I liked the bird collision with the window when I saw the trailer. The film started with the slow to moderate pacing of witnessing a family in the throes of tension created by the economy---bunker mentalities abound. Then something happened in Sammie's bedroom that made me jump the same way I did with ""signs"". Then pow. I was in. I immediately thought of the first script version of Close Encounters written by Paul Schrader ""Taxi Driver"". Spielberg turned it down saying it was mean spirited and didn't want a hostile invasion story. This movie was that draft. This independent piece was a homage to Close Encounters of the third kind, ET, The Birds, Poltergeist, Signs, and Paranormal Activity. Harvey Weinstein greenlit a film which was carried surprizingly well by the acting chops of Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton. I actually cared what happened to these people and thats rare for a scary film to be character and plot driven. The director kept his camera tight on the faces so the actors could not milk their expressions. The blank face fear always works.  The soundtrack is very effective in its use against silence.  The tension spilling on the children made me believe this couple has been toxic toward each other for a long time---long before the movie's circumstances introduced the audience to them. And maybe that tension drew the attacks to their home in the first place.
 Why not being that original, the film compensated with the right mix of old recipes without diluting its ability to reveal enough of the story on a need to know basis to the audience just as it did to the characters. I didn't feel the need to be smarter than the movie. Expect a sequel.",1363478400,50,1738,4.7105263157894735
5584539,5,B00BEIYG98,"I went to this movie in theaters and I thought it was great! Scary enough to make you jump at times and funny enough to make a chuckle every once in a while.  I did just start with horror movies though and I've only seen two: Mama and this, so I don't know if my definition of scary is acceptable.  If you do buy it, I think it'd be a keeper.  The ending was pretty bad though, unless you love cliff-hangers.",1362182400,4,408,4.012345679012346
5584540,4,B00BEIYG98,"Excellent contemporary horror film / best by the makers of Paranormal Activity since their original.  About an avg.

They're 3 months behind on their mortgage, when strange things start happening at home.

5584541,3,B00BEIYG98,"This is nothing like Signs (2002) and everything like Paranormal Activity (2007).  This should probably be re-titled Extraterrestrial Activity.

The Barrett family--Lacy (Keri Russell), Daniel (Josh Hamilton), and their two young boys--is going through a tough time.  Both self-employed parents are doing poorly, their mortgage is months past due, their older son (12-14 yrs old) is beginning to learn more about girls and has a best friend they disapprove of, and they have recently been having some issues with their home security.

Overnight, strange things--very strange things--begin happening around the house.  Household objects are stacked impossibly high (an unsubtle nod to Paranormal Activity and, by extension, Poltergeist), their alarm system goes off with no sign of a security breach, very weird sleepwalking, unvaluable things noticeably disappearing, their five year old is producing some strange artwork, kamikaze bird migrations and the list goes on with each event seeming senselessly random and persisting without any explanationlike, at allthroughout the whole movie.

Unfortunately most of the weird goings on in this movie are just that--weird things that ""happen"" that we happen to watch because someone shoved them into the movie.  As a whole, they don't do anything for the movie or serve a solid purpose.  Well, okay they should have, but they were handled (i.e., directed) poorly.  While a few of these events come with eerie and/or jump-scare value, overall they were unsatisfying.

After a few calls to the police answered by some quippy accusations aimed at their children, Daniel installs six security cameras inside the house.  Again, an unsubtle nod to Paranormal Activity and, by extension, Poltergeist.  These scenes were necessary and handled realistically, but came off as equal parts sort of funny and boring.  Again, I approve of the screenwriting and disapprove of the direction.

As their investigations lead to more questions than answers, they turn to an alien specialist (calmly underplayed by J. K. Simmons) who explains their situation to them, what to do, what to expect, etcetera.  I love Simmons, but this whole down-played, one-scene segment was much less effective than the exciting introduction of a paranormal investigation team (e.g., Insidious) or a medium (e.g., The Pact) into the house for the entire third act.

Now I've been ragging on this movie quite a bit.  But some major things that are often done poorly in horror were done very well here.  1) For example, like Paranormal Activity 1 & 2 and Poltergeist, I really gave a damn about the Barrett family.  I may not have been impressed with the weird events, but I was concerned about what they meant to Lacy and her sons.  2) The social reaction to crazy claims and weird events was thoughtfully approached to produce ""real"" reactions that worked well for the most part, especially when the parents are assessing consequences for their actions.  3) Most suspense-driven horror is exciting for a while and then crumbles when it comes to neatly ending the story.  Not the case here.  The finale was neither disappointing nor impressive, but it smacked of somethinggood writing!  In fact, not only was the ending thoughtful and quietly paved throughout the story, but the whole story struck me as well-written--even though I felt the execution of the ""weird events"" hamstrung the overall quality of the film.

Writer/director Scott Stewart: great ideas, great writing, still working out the kinks as a director.

See this.  It's not bad; it's just that extremely similar movies have been done much better.  This makes for an entertaining watch and should make for a good, jumpy date movie on the couch.  Don't let my critical nature scare you away from this.  The better points of the movie are hard to rave about in a review and you should see and judge it for yourself.",1361923200,8,3884,5.15814696485623
5584542,3,B00BEIYG98,"On the whole, it's pretty good commodity entertainment - not one to remember (maybe not even next week), but popcorn-worthy.

It follows a fairly familiar trajectory: weird things happen, no one [except a crackpot] takes them seriously, then it really hits the fan - and it turns out that the pot wasn't cracked after all, but no one's going to believe it. The agency behind all the goings-on might not be the horror-story standard, but that works. And, it keeps you on edge right to the end.

A few things give this an up to date edge, including the social consequences of mysterious marks on the kids. But, on the whole, I found it an ordinary specimen of a genre I rarely follow.

5584543,4,B00BEIYG98,"I really liked this movie. I found it very entertaining and just the perfect amount of scary. Unlike most scary movies, this one has a storyline amidst all the horror. Very enjoyable, wouldn't mind buying. I give it an A",1361836800,2,220,4.525
5584544,4,B00BEIYG98,"Written and directed by Scott Stewart, Dark Skies stars Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton as Lacy and Daniel Barrett (respectively), a typical married couple with two sons, Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan Rockett).  After a series of abnormal occurrences at home (while the family is sleeping), paranoia grows amongst Daniel and Lacy when they start to believe intruders may be entering the house, eventually finding a connection between their son, Sam, and his bad dreams.  Sam claims the sandman enters his dreams and causes him to do things he doesnt want to do, but as time progresses, the entire family soon starts experiencing similar unexplainable events, including unaccountable time gaps, abusive marks to their body, and random ringing in their ears.  J.K. Simmons also stars in a supporting role as Edwin Pollard, a conspiracy theorist that has previously dealt with these occurrences.

When this film begins, the very first thing youll see is the Dimension Films logo  and in case you are unaware of that particular meaning, it should instantly tapper your expectations.  In the past, Dimension Films has been responsible for some of the worst films to grace the big screen  films such as the Halloween sequels, basically anything Wes Craven has ever done, and a slew of cult favorites  like Sin City, Scary Movie, and The Crow.  However  and surprisingly, Dark Skies is an entertaining experience, especially since it initially had the potential to be a complete bust.  After watching countless films with a wide variety of alien encounters, Signs - the 2002 sci-fi thriller starring Mel Gibson  immediately comes to mind as a comparison for Dark Skies.  Both feature plots about aliens invading the earth and hitting a family at the core in a very real way, while the majority of the plot takes place in the familys houses.  The aliens themselves are also comparable in both of these films, with Signs featuring a much more corporeal creature and Dark Skies featuring ghost-like creatures.

The majority of the scenes in this film are dominated by Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton  the married couple struggling to pay their bills while assuming the job of protecting their sons from super natural, alien creatures.  Their on-screen presence is another unexpected surprise in the film  featuring a decent amount of dramatic scenes in which its completely believable that they're a struggling married couple.  Some scenes are better than others as far as the suspense goes, and for those of us that don't enjoy the scenes that make you jump, this film will be tolerable, borderline enjoyable to you.  The hardcore sci-fi/horror buffs will find this to be another tedious disappointment that never meets the mark.  Also, there's a historically memorable scene involving a few flock of birds that will be reminiscent of Hitchcock's suspense thriller, The Birds.

Overall, Dark Skies is a clich driven film, yet it makes for a great date night experience  with just the right amount of scary.  If there were any more jump out scenes, the film may have you thinking about nonchalantly taking a bathroom break or twisting your dates arm to let you go buy them some popcorn.  But - rest assured, youll survive this one to tell the tale.

5584545,4,B00BEIYG98,"""Dark Skies"" (2013 relase; 97 min.) brings the story of the Barrett family. Mom (played by Keri ""Felicity"" Russell) and dad (played by Josh Hamilton) are stressing because of their precarious financial situation (Dad is in between jobs, mom is barely hanging on to her real easate brokerage). They have two sons, 13 yr. old Jesse and 5 or 6 yr. old Sammy. Then slowly but surely strange things are starting to happen in and around the house, including a strange ""remodeling"" of the kitchen, then disappearance of pictures, and then hundreds of birds flying head-on into the house for no apparent reason. What is going on here exactly? At this point we're not even half-way into the movie, and things are to get a lot more tense than that still. But to tell you more of a plot-heavy movie like this would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, I had seen the trailer for this movie a few times in recent weeks, and thought it looked kinda interesting. I took a chance on this, and am glad I did. It is not a horror movie as such, nor is it really a sci-fi movie. ""Dark Skies"" actually falls somewhere in between, and on more than one occasion during the movie I saw elements from the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise and also from the ""Poltergeist"" franchise just to name those. Second, what a delight to see Keri Russell again,as I sort of lost track of her. It is incredible that 2013 marks the 15th anniversary of when ""Felicity"" first hit the small screen. Russell is ageing quite nicely (if you can call someone in their mid/late-30s ""ageing""), and she carries this movie, period. Kudos also to young Kadan Rockett as little Sammy, and J.K. Simmons who plays a small role late into the movie. Third, I must give a shout-out to the excellent placement of the Drums song ""Days"" midway into the movie, bringing a few moments of tension relief (for reasons I don't want to reveal) at that point in the movie.

The screening I saw ""Dark Skies"" at tonight here in Cincinnati was quite well attended. Smartly the director and producers of the movie made this into a PG-13 movie, rather than an R rated movie, and the audience tonight was heavily tilted towards the younger HS kids. They were loving this movie, laughing and screaming (sometimes at the same time) at all the right moments, and when the credits started to roll, the audience even gave an applause. Bottom line: ""Dark Skies"" is surprisingly entertaining, and better than I had expected.",1361491200,97,2522,4.6524663677130045

5584617,5,B00BEIYG98,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed/written by Scott Stewart, Dark Skies chronicles increasingly strange events at the Barrett residence in Suburbia, USA. The parents (Josh Hamilton & Keri Russell) slowly come to believe that the cause of the havoc might be extraterrestrial. J.K. Simmons plays a solemn expert on the subject with whom the couple seek advice.

This is an amalgam of Poltergeist (1982), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Signs (2002), The Forgotten (2004) and Night Skies (2007). Its as good or better than the best of em and is significantly more compelling than Signs, which is a decent movie but ""Signs"" is actually about something other than alien visitation (see my review for evidence).

Critics say the movies too slow, but I never got this impression. I found the steady build-up engaging with several effectively creepy or scary moments. This is the opposite of lame horror flicks like The Hollow (2015) where the filmmakers overdo it with amped-up horror clichs every three minutes to hold the attention of viewers with ADHD. Russell is competent and attractive, but looks like she needs to gain about 20-25 lbs.

THE MOVIE RUNS 97 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita, California, with additional work done in NYC.

5584723,5,B00BEIYG98,"This movie is obviously only going to really appeal to those who are inquisitive of what lies beyond our own perceptions. I actually had this on my ""to watch"" list for a long time and I am really glad I finally gave it a go. Every shot, every scene, beautifully builds the tension for what you know is coming. Most movies are more entertaining to me if I have no clue what's coming, but this one had a slow burn build up that left no question as to what will happen (in a general sense: abduction) and that, to me, was terrifying. It's like when you were a kid getting shots and the scariest part ended up being those painfully long seconds before the doctor even gave you the shot. I still can't walk around my house at night without fearing a run in with a figure in the dark...shoot just typing that sentence gave me goosebumps again.

The actors were believable and you actually find yourself rooting for them, something that is a rarity in most horror/sci fi films. This movie is like Signs, but grown up. What made Signs great to me was that it left a lot up to your imagination and Dark Skies does that too, except better. In Signs we knew they were coming, but in Dark Skies we know that they are already with us. They push the envelop in a few scenes that made me audibly gasp. Watching this with surround sound was amazing as well.

I am one of those people that cry out for creative, original concepts. This movie seems to borrow techniques from several previous classics but it is so good at doing what it sets out to do. It's like riding roller coasters and then finally riding a REAL roller coaster. It's not necessarily anything new, but it gets your heart pumping and could possibly cause you to crap yourself.",1471564800,,1726,4.373831775700935

5584815,3,B00BEIYG98,"Part Sci-Fi and part supernatural horror, Dark Skies treads a fine line between both genres but never fully commits to either in this hodgepodge production.  The Barrett Family begins to experience strange happens in their quiet suburban home.  Ad first its minor things like food being spilled out of the refrigerator or photos being removed from picture frames but soon the events become more chilling an dangerous.  A flock of hundreds of birds flies into their house, family members begin sleep walking and stand unresponsive outside.

Lacy (Keri Russell) has a viewing at a house for sale. As she's pitching the house to a couple, she becomes unable to speak and enters a trance. She walks towards the glass door and begins to bash her head repeatedly against it before waking up in her bed without any memory of how she got there.  Most terrifying is that a shadowy figure is seen standing over the childrens bed.

So ok, theres some terrifying stuff going on and that should be enough to carry the film but Director Scott Stewart apparently didn't feel this was strong enough so he adds in a lot of filler melodrama.  The husband, Daniel is out of work and struggling to pay the bills, teenaged son Jesse is beginning to experiment with drugs, etcBut everything begins to fall apart when Lacy begins to do some research on the internet and finds other families who have experienced the same phenomena.

She tracks down and expert (J.K. Simmons) who just happens to live nearby mind you, and he spills the beans with little sense of style, matter-of-factly telling the Barretts that they are experiencing alien visitations and theres little they can do other than make it so difficult on the aliens that they move on to another family.  Gee, and I thought they were going to invite them for dinner.  Keri Russell does an admirable job but cant save the ending from falling apart under its own weight.",1438387200,,1906,4.76595744680851

5584825,5,B00BEIYG98,"The concept of this movie requires an open mind to the possibility of UFO abduction cases and is admittedly a leap for many. If you do not believe or are not open to the possibility of the concept presented in this movie your review or approval will be based strictly as a science fiction movie which is totally understandable. With that said having read books on abduction cases the research that went into this movie was amazing. I fully expected this to be treated poorly but based on the literature available they nailed it as far as what has been claimed and reported. The acting in this movie and the progression the family experienced was very well done although I know of only one disappearance  which lasted five days not permanently. Admittedly I like Kerry Russel but the main cast was excellent as well. If after seeing this movie and have a curiosity about the reported claims Amazon has several excellent books on the subject. For me, the production crew and researchers did their jobs well. As for books,  examples would be The Allagash Abduction in Maine, Betty an Barney Hill, Books by Hopkins and Dr. Mack would be interesting.

5584878,3,B00BEIYG98,"Despite my love of Science Fiction, I had no desire to see Dark Skies. Someone from the groups Facebook page messaged me, telling me it was right up my alley, so I decided to give it a shot, and you know what, they were right! Dark Skies is portrayed as something completely different in the trailers and ads. I was under the impression that it was another of these crazy awful demonic possession films, but it was a whole lot more interesting than that. The Barrett family is experiencing some weird occurrences in their home that they can't explain. At first it seems like the kids are pulling pranks, but they come to realize it's much more serious than that. The family has become the target of an alien race known as the grays, and are fearing an eventual abduction. Felicity herself, Keri Russell, gives an interesting performance with a cold, quiet, intensity that was something to see, but the real star of the movie was young Dakota Goyo. Goyo is best known as the annoying little kid in Reel Steel, but he's grown up quickly, and was simply the most realistic character in the whole film. What makes Dark Skies unique is it's fantastic ending, which was very unexpected, and much more eclectic than one would expect to see in a film like this. Some fans complained that the ending was too reminiscent to that of 1408, and while it was similar, unlike 1408, the ending of Dark Skies wasn't nearly as predictable. The ending comes out of nowhere and as far as I'm concerned, it's the cherry on the sundae. Dark Skies wasn't as technical or scientific as the most of the Sci-Fi I like, but it was still quite entertaining and the ending made a good film that much better.",1427673600,,1678,4.541254125412541

5584947,5,B00BEIYG98,"This was a very interesting movie. Towards the end of WW2 war pilots began to report seeing things in the skies that they couldn't  identify. Thus the term UFO. During the 50's and right up until (2015) today we love seeing UFO movies such as ""Earth Versus The Flying Saucers"" and ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"". So many people that have come forward and talked about their encounters have been branded as loons and much worse.

There are groups that are dedicated to the study of UFO's. Some are legitimate but so many are fringe loons. The government has even been accused of a cover up in this area. True or not, I don't know. With the advent of video cameras and cell phone cameras there seems to be an abundance of evidence to support the theory that they do in fact exist. Even our astronauts have reported seeing unexplainable things while in space.
I think that there could very well be an explanation for all of this. An explanation that has never been preached and may, to some, sound crazy. If you look at the subject and the evidence that we have so far and i'm talking about the logical, verifiable evidence, not the back yard so called ""home made special effects"" there can be another explanation. If we look at this from a Biblical standpoint and point of view then this thought comes to mind. God created each and everyone of us in his image. We are all the same but with some very subtle differences. We all have arms, legs, hands, feet and heads. Our skin color may be different. Other than that, we are all the same. We are in fact created created in God's image.
There have been many differing descriptions of so called aliens not of earth and none of them comes close to looking like God's creation, us.
Could these ""Little Green and/or Grey men and their modes of transportation be satanic in nature for the purpose of drawing our thoughts away from God, our creator? You decide.",1423958400,,1907,4.508670520231214

5585012,4,B00BEIYG98,"Inexplicable, possibly spooky things happening to ordinary middle class Americans; weve seen it many times before and Dark Skies, on the surface, is no different. We have the typical suburban family living unremarkable, ordinarily complicated lives. Suddenly there are strange goings-on and the usual husband vs wife disbelief until stuff starts happening to him too. Cue the kids drawings (a much over-used clich, if ever there was one) and the compulsory visit to a believer/expert. Its all very stock-in-trade horror stuff.

However, much like Insidious (until the last half hour or so, anyway) and the superior Sinister the pace and tension are superbly managed as the aforementioned goings-on escalate. The kids, in particular, are excellent; its nice to see a young American kid without a speech impediment (apart from being American, obviously) and all of the performances are credible.

Its all very silly and a bit formulaic, of course, but entertaining nonetheless with plenty of splendid jumps, a different take on the old strange goings-on theme and an original ending. While not on the same level of abject terror as the Grudge (my benchmark scary movie), Dark Skies manages to do something slightly different in a completely oversaturated genre.",1421539200,,1259,5.321608040201005

Keri Russel turns in the most solid performance, and the kids were quite good - the husband I found to actually be rather one-dimensional. He kind of wears a deer-in-the-headlights face throughout most of the film, and generally turned in a semi-highly strung father character - a bit like Keanu Reeves after too many espressos.

5585107,3,B00BEIYG98,"The Baretts are a normal suburban family.  They've got their issues, mainly financial, but there's nothing unusual about them.  Until strange things begin happening around the house.  Like a mess in the kitchen in the middle of the night.  The alarm going off for no reason.  The flocks of birds smashing into the window.  And that's just the beginning.  Before long, Lacy and Daniel begin to suspect that their home is being visited by beings from another world...who want to take their son with them.

There's a lot of promise in DARK SKIES, which is why I deemed it worthy of reviewing.  (I normally don't review something if it's complete crud; I mean, why waste the words?)  The acting, for one, is solid all across the board, especially Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton as the parents struggling to understand what's going on.  Kudos also to the two child leads, Dakota Goyo and Kadan Rockett, and especially J.K. Simmons as an abduction expert (it's actually a very nuanced performance, considering he only has one scene).  There is also quite a lot of disturbing imagery, and a sense of claustrophobia that pervades the entire piece.  The premise writer/director Scott Stewart brought to the table was simple: what does a normal family go through when they face a growing tragedy they can't understand?

That's the premise.  The execution...that's where things start to fall apart.  The first half of the film is pretty darn good; things slowly build and build.  Until the final act, where it just kind of becomes the creature feature you were afraid it would be.  I'm not sure how you do an alien abduction film without showing the aliens, but that would've been great; alien abduction as a metaphor for familial struggles is a nice idea, and that's where Stewart seems to be going.  The final act doesn't completely undo everything, but it makes you wonder what could've been, if instead of going for the jump scares and special effects, the filmmakers had decided to keep things unsettling and ambiguous.

  Dark Skies combines my two favorite Genres, Horror & Science Fiction.  Most would call this a straight up Sci-Fi.  Hat to break it to you folks, it's both!  The Film has a good cast which includes: Dakota Goyo (Thor & Real Steel), Josh Hamilton, Kerri Russle (Felicity), & J. K. Simmons (Juno, Law & Order: SVU, & Spider Man 1, 2, & 3).

5585282,5,B00BEIYG98,"What Dark Skies does is perfectly combine Mel Gibson's Signs with the classic 80's film Poltergeist to deliver a thrilling alien-invading horror.  There's a few scenes in particular that REALLY got to me and this is coming from someone who's watched hundreds of horror films over the years.  Proof that scaring me is still possible!  No this isn't necessarily a jump scare type movie like Paranormal Activity.  Dark Skies contains an actual plot that involves a suburban family (a wife, husband and two young boys) who try their best to explain the unusual events that gradually increase in bizarreness as the movie moves along.  Well actually, it's more like Keri Russell (the wife) experiences really strange events in the middle of the night when she wanders around the house, and from there the rest of her family experiences things until it eventually drives them crazy.

This movie takes the alien invasion concept to a MUCH more satisfying extent, which is where Signs sort of got boring and felt like a disappointment (since that movie was shy with the alien encounters with the exception of a few key moments of course).  I don't want to give away what makes Dark Skies like Poltergeist either because I'd be spoiling key moments of the storyline.  Let's just say, this movie does a wonderful job making horror lovers feel satisfied from beginning to end.  I don't even want to mention all the freaky moments because there's so many of them.  Timing is key in freaking out viewers I believe, and the timing here is spot-on pretty much every single time something crazy happens.

This is actually what I was hoping Signs was like back in 2002 when I first heard about it.  Creepy nonstop atmosphere, aliens giving a family a hard time and being relentless about it, solid characters and an exciting storyline.  Dark Skies is one of the best alien type movies out there.  What makes it so special is that these aliens aren't your typical arriving-on-a-spaceship type silliness.  This is more effectively subtle than that.  No these aliens have been around for millions of years, targeting specific families and there's apparently no way to stop them from their mission to torment people (usually at night).  This is why there's nowhere to run for this family, since nobody believes that the events they're experiencing are the result of aliens.  Who'd believe such a thing?  Surely not the cops.  Surely not the neighbors.  Surely not the doctors or the therapists who the family discusses their situation with.

Expect to be scared.  Oh and expect one member of the family to experience the worst fate.  Bet you can't guess which one!  I have to mention one key moment that totally freaked me out.  When the mother thought her son was talking to his brother over a walky talky while in his bedroom, she opens the door... and gets the shock of her life as we witness the scariest moment in the movie for me.  The dark lighting and giving us *just* the right amount of horror at this particular moment made is so good.  Awesome!",1403222400,2,3034,4.782692307692308
5585283,4,B00BEIYG98,"A family having the usual problems during these times..husband needing a job, wife making ends barely meet, just-entering-adolescence son having unapproved friends...suddenly is thrust into turmoil. Strange things begin to happen making it seem someone is breaking into the house but the alarms are never tripped and the police brush it off as pranks by one of their kids to counteract their ""problems."" When the wife begins ""missing time,"" the husband sleeps walks amid gushing nosebleeds, and the sons show marks leading the neighbors and police to believe they're being abused, things spiral out of control. The wife swears she saw someone in her youngest son's room and takes it from there to the Internet where she soon finds many others suffering the same problems and learns the visitations aren't from poltergeists but aliens. Armed with printouts, she and her husband seek out an ""expert"" only to discover he's so disheartened he no longer tries to help, and it's downhill from that point on...

This was definitely a suspenseful movie, sometimes uncomfortable and frustrating when no one listens to their pleas.  It would've been good to have a little more interaction/empathy with the neighbors, however, or perhaps the family's having to go through this ordeal by themselves with no outside help, was the best way to show their isolation from their fellow humans.  The actual show-down doesn't come until about the last 10 minutes of the film and it's a great built-up until then, after that...blah as far as I'm concerned.  Perhaps it's simply my own dissatisfaction with the usual trend of having a negative finish to a film but I was extremely disappointed with the ending, especially the Big Blackout.

So, the movie is slow to progress, which I actually liked because it builds up and you start to wonder what could possibly happen next. However, there is so much build-up that it just seems to end abruptly. There is no conclusion and the ending left me feeling like there should have been more after the abduction. Seriously, the boy contacts his brother via walkie talkie from an alien planet and then the credits roll? No!! I wanted to hear more about the other abductions, what the family did afterwards and any other possible conclusion. The ending just leaves you wondering, which is sometimes great in film, but, in this case, it just sits wrong with me and just made me angry.

5585327,5,B00BEIYG98,"A lot of people would contend that the alien abduction genre lost a lot of its steam a while ago, but by shifting the general theme from a science fiction/government conspiracy story to a horror story, this one chapter in the genre is certainly pretty fresh.  Gone, for this one, are the black-clad government agencies and the bigger theories as to the aliens' overall agenda; in is a single family beseiged by inexplicable and seemingly unstoppable forces.  ""Dark Skies"" has a lot of the atmosphere and feel of recent horror winners like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insidious/dp/B0055D3EFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insidious</a>&nbsp;(and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insidious-Chapter-2/dp/B00GMOQNPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insidious: Chapter 2</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sinister/dp/B00B6DTWM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sinister</a>, but a different type of menace.  Little is explained as to the motives of the beings terrorizing the family as they attempt to choose their main target for abduction; this is in fitting with the movie though.  As said, there's no big thinktank of government scientists coming up with reasons; there's the family and the one, publically ostracized, knowledgable source that the family turns to for help.  So you get what these characters experience and are able to find out, and nobody finds an alien computer terminal which they conveniently hack into and find a neat little summary of the alien agenda.

Cerain questions, not necasarily raised directly in the movie, do come to mind.  Are the beings just evil?  Or do they simply not stop to think about things from the perspective of their 'test subjects' (don't we humans do that at times in our labs?)?  Do they even recognize us as sentient, or are their forms of consciousness and perception so radically different from ours that they don't?  Do they (and this is something that has apparantly been raised by people who study the phenomena of alien abduction and really believe in it) even have concepts of 'pain' and 'fear' - if not that would explain their seeming indifference toward their 'subjects'.  And to take that to the extreme, are the aliens themselves even what we would call sentient?  Another angle, hinted at but not confirmed in one instance in the movie: would their actions and behavior seem less 'evil' if we knew the whole of their reasonings, and had more to go on than fragmented memories (assuming thoses memories are even wholly accurate)?  Or would they seem worse?  There's a great hook toward the end of the movie that plays into at least a couple of these questions, and indicates there may be a second 'Dark Skies' at some point.

This is a smart, scary and well-made movie that should appeal to fans of horror, science fiction, and thrillers, and is one of the most unjustly overlooked movies of 2013.  Highly reccommended.",1393113600,2,3004,5.657015590200445

5585331,4,B00BEIYG98,"Can I quickly point out what people may like or not like about the film?
[Note: spoiler alert, already spoiled by other reviews].  If you just want a
horror movie you probably will not like this film.  It is suspenseful without
being gory.  If you just want to get to the heart of weirdness you'll find
the beginning ""slow"" or ""boring"".  I don't think it was slow or boring at all.
The first half of the movie shows one family going through the kind of
quiet agony that millions in the US and everywhere go through: dad
was laid off and can't find another job.  Mom has a ""job"" but no sales
and therefore no income.  She has a chance to sell a house but she knows
it may not be the best one for the buyers.  Ethical dilemma: because they
desperately need some income, does she talk them into buying anyhow?
Or does she tell them the truth and maybe lose the only income in months?
The older son is just at the age where he's interested in girls and dating.
Usual awkward moments.  There's a kid in the neighborhood that dad
feels is a bad influence, but it's the boy's closest friend.  Younger boy
still at the stage of fearing what's under the bed in the dark.  Yes, against
this ""normal"" background, strangeness unfolds gradually, and keeps
on getting stronger right to the end of the movie.  More than anything else,
the film reminded me of the ""Poltergeist"" series in the way the oddness
unfolds in a family beset by plenty of normal problems.
Yeah...alien abduction...to me, it was a disappointment.  I would prefer just
leaving the strange unexplained, rather than falling back on this
""explanation"" that plenty of people believe is real.
To me perhaps the epitome of this movie was the first really ""strange""
event: the bizarre ""redecoration"" or whatever one calls it, in the
kitchen.  Yeah, the ending leaves room for a sequel though I am
skeptical there will be one.",1391817600,,1875,4.544642857142857

5585377,4,B00BEIYG98,"This a fun horror film based upon the greys visitation and abduction lore. The story is focused on a seemingly normal suburban family, times are hard with the father looking for work, leaving the mother to earn a living for the family. Strange things start happening, to begin with just odd and unsettling, but gradually these events become more sinister and focused on the younger of the two sons.

The story itself isn't anything particularly original and follows the pattern common with the grey's visitation reports. Although it is predictable there's a few small twists along the way to keep things interesting.

What the film does do well is the atmosphere, it builds a respectable sense of menace from the minor occurrences at the beginning to the dramatic conclusion. I like the fact that it plays the low key sinister approach rather than simply relying on shocks. Another aspect that worked for me (although could have been more developed) was the interaction with the regular agencies and how that helps define the family's response to the events.

Each of characters provides something useful to the film and even aid with some of misdirection that goes on, the other strength here are the greys themselves, while they do make a few appearances, it's not so often that they lose their impact.

5585436,3,B00BEIYG98,"Dark Skies is written and directed by Scott Stewart, whose previous works as director include Legion and Priest. Now I think this fact tells you something about what his latest film is all about. Dark Skies is a dark thriller with fantasy elements, an atmospheric film with stylish visuals, of which story sounds a bit too familiar.

The film revolves around the Barrett family living in the suburbs: father and mother Daniel (Josh Hamilton) and Lacy (Keri Russell), with oldest son Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and youngest son Sammy (Kadan Rockett). One day the parents discover that someone or something has been inside their house. Following this disturbing discovery, a series of strange things starts to happen to them.

Dark Skies tells a familiar story with some social and psychological undertones. The father is currently out of work. The mother is working very hard as a real estate agent. The kids talk to each other through walkie-talkie. Even more serious issues (child abuse, for instance) are touched upon.

For all these attempts to enhance suspense and credibility, however, Dark Skies remains what it is: an OK thriller that is decent, but not outstanding. These characters plight remains unexplored. There are a few chilling set-pieces, to be sure, and the film as a whole manages to entertain, but what you see here, you have seen in similar themed films..",1387756800,,1368,5.0176211453744495

5585445,4,B00BEIYG98,"There are some reviewers who claim Dark Skies is just a re-hash full of un-original ideas around alien abductions but what they fail to understand is that there IS a whole lot of mystery behind many actual still unexplained possible alien encounters. Dark Skies doesn't try and ramp up the experience with a lot of new Hollywood mumbo jumbo ridiculousness, they keep it focused on what's better: reality.

Dark Skies treads a line between 'Communion' (movie version of Whitley Streiber's actual experiences of allegedly making contact with aliens) and the stylistic elements of 'Signs' (but thankfully without the over-acted and shoddily created stereotypical characters. Sorry Shyamalon, it had to be said) What emerges is a story that although you may have seen it before is a very plausible, frightening and at times terrifying view of a family at odds involving what to do about the aliens who seem bent on eventually abducting one of them. I found myself immersed in the story and caring about the characters and what was going to happen to them, which isn't something Hollywood is known for in sci-fi and horror movies of late.

Did I get any surprises regarding the person who would eventually be abducted? No, and anyone who's watched the genre regularly will see and assemble the clues long before the answer actually comes, but that doesn't really matter when you are treated to such a good caliber thriller. Reality doesn't need plot twists, and Dark Skies was realistic enough to rise above the usual fare of covering up a weak film by trying to offer a surprise at the end so that people sitting in the theater for an hour and a half watching drivel don't feel the experience is completely wasted. Translation: if you want an unrealistic, crappy acted and shot film with plot holes galore and characters you can't wait to meet their demise, Dark Skies is not for you.

So if I enjoyed the film so much, why not 5 stars? The reason lies in the secondary elements of Goyo's character and the older crowd he wants to hang with. We see numerous times where Goyo's big brother character is caring and mature yet playful enough to still be a kid. His interactions with his little brother are terrific and this is where the filmmakers should have kept their focus. The scenes with Goyo and the older kids smoking pot and groping each other or making rude sexual remarks were pointless and easily tossed out of the film. The aliens being smart as they are portrayed would still have felt his rebel attitude against his father and still would have used it against the family in the long run to further emotionally separate him from them. Hopefully with the sequel (and yes, we WILL see a sequel) the focus will be 100% where it should be. Dark Skies is an intelligent film and it shouldn't have to pander to adolescent stereotype behavior in order to get young people to see it. If the adults are realistically portrayed throughout, then the same should be true of the young actors as well, especially since the young actors in their family scenes here are so terrific and often outshine the adults. It isn't necessary for Dark Skies to have even the slightest hint of any of the throwaway teen tripe so prevalent in many of the watch-it-once-and-forget-it genre of scary movies.

Still, if you're a fan of being frightened without gore and with a good story that makes you excited to see a sequel, (another very tough thing to do when we know most sequels usually stink) then the weather forecast calls for Dark Skies.",1385164800,,3523,4.732899022801303

5585511,2,B00BEIYG98,"I know from the other reviews a lot of folks are going to disagree with my review.  That's okay.  But I'm not the only one here who is unimpressed with this flem... uh, film.

Really, this film simply is not good.  I can't see any honest movie critic-- or earnest sci fi fan-- giving this a positive rating. I have to believe from the number of 5 star reviews that the studio paid their employees to go to Amazon and sing its praises.  Whenever we see a presentation like this I have to wonder why it is that people waste intellect, time and money making such a flick.

It's not far into the movie that we realize this is yet another alien-invasion movie.  If you want to cuddle with your girl and get a few chuckles every time you jump (twice I think), this might be worth a look.  But if you want plausible plot, rhyme or reason for making this movie other than ""we think we can make some real bucks off of this UFO rip-off""... you will be disappointed.

There is nothing original here, nothing that hasn't been done before, in exactly the same manner, with nearly the same plot-- and done better.  You can see the SIGNS of where this film is going almost from the start.  I'm somewhat surprised people didn't start setting out glasses of water and shouting ""Swing away, Merrill!"".

Honestly, once you've seen one alien abduction movie you've seen them all.  This plotline is getting as trite and over-done as time-travel.  Some films are more plausible than others.  But this one doesn't even provide the viewer with a new twist; it's an old plot on an old theme and it's just plain tired.  A viewer may really enjoy this if they believe alien abductions occur or if they themselves have uh... actually been abducted (I don't make fun of anyone here).  But beyond that-- this is just rehashed hash.

Let me be self-honest:  maybe the reason I didn't enjoy it is because I believe aliens have better things to do with their time than come to earth and probe humans.  I mean think about it folks:  would we go to an alien planet and spend our time secretly probing their species?  Wait, don't answer that.  I think I just argued myself into a corner.  However, that doesn't make this movie any better.

My initial reaction during the first half was ""well, this might be interesting"".  At the end of the movie the first thought that came to my head was, ""Wow, was that a total waste of time.""  It's the genre. If anyone ever makes another one of these, it should only be if they have a totally new, completely different take and approach on this-- and can then produce it in total-3D surround-hologram form.  Until then, movie makers... please give this plotline a rest.

There are better films to make, better stories to tell.  If one is going to spend this much time and money, start with a good script, a new plot, and work from there.  These re-done remake-of-a-remake-of-a-remake plots are getting tiresome.",1384387200,,2912,4.521072796934866

As skeptical as I am at times, I have a hard time declining to myself that we are alone. Possible the first real document of aliens is actually paintings in the caves made by ancient people. When I think of it the answer is clear of whether we are alone or not. But what scares me is that even though we are ''so advanced'' in technology, science, we will not believe everything we hear or see (even if it's with our own eyes). Imagine how many people are left alone, feeling and being isolated. Imagine how many people in the past and present fought something like what was depicted int he movie. Scary. I don't say we should believe everything we see, but if you want answers you have to hunt for them. Not a bad movie at all. Makes you think about a lot of things.",1381968000,,935,4.258426966292135

I'd seen the commercials before it hit theaters and thought it was just another ""creepy kid meets spooky creatures"" flick. And, to a degree, it was. But this movie made me suspend my disbelief and added a twist that I really enjoyed.

The acting was generally good and believable given the families circumstances. Although there were a couple ""WTF? How did they not notice that?"" moments, the majority of the film had me guessing what would become of this family.

*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*

While we've all seen the birds scene in the commercials, the creepiest part for me was when the mother was walking down the hallway once they had barricaded themselves in and right behind her, without her knowing, was one of the greys. His hands outstretched. I love the buildup of suspense like that and, in my opinion, this film had a lot of moments when you had no idea what would happen.

5585691,3,B00BEIYG98,"Dark Skies is a very uneven film, sprinkled throughout with some very real tension and scares that will get your attention, at least briefly.  This kind of film has been done a few times before and they're all about the same in one way or another.  Dark Skies is, perhaps, the better of this genre of films; that of alien visitations and abductions and such.  In the end, however, there is something generally lacking in this film.  There is a perverse sense of hopelessness and helplessness at the hands of these aliens that never gets fully explored or resolved in any truly meaningful way.  I get the sense that that is way that the writer/director Scott Stewart intended it.  Be that as it may, it leaves the film somewhat unsatisfying in the end.  I like a film with some sense of resolution.  Dark Skies simply leaves things hanging with no clear purpose to it's existence.  Are these beings so far advanced from us that we are little more than cattle for their use and disposal?  Is our own intelligence (or lace thereof) so insignificant to them that we simply don't count for anything; that their purpose is beyond anything we are capable of comprehending?  Well, as you can see, at least the film gets me to thinking a little.  Quite frankly, I'm not into the whole alien thing, so it actually holds little interest to me.  I am looking at Dark Skies strictly as a MOVIE experience, in the same way that I view a zombie movie.  I do not take it seriously.  So I am left looking at this movie as a a movie of interest, but one that is also deeply flawed in terms of overall plot, intention, etc.  Stewart is among those directors who seems to take great delight in attempting to make supernatural elements appear to be as real and as probably as possible.  There are many in the public who choose to believe such things as aliens and supernatural forces, etc.  Stewart certainly relishes in helping them reinforce those beliefs.  That is the art of the illusionist, if not the con man and hoaxter.  But as a film, Dark Skies left me, in the end feeling unsatisfied and empty, wanting more of something.  Still, will watch it again.  It does have enough interest and delights contained within it that make it at least a very entertaining way to spend some time with.  The acting and over-all production are very high quality.  There is little that falls in line of the ""cheesy"", cheap shot here. Just bear in mind that Dark Skies has a number of moments that languish and induce a certain level of boredom throughout in spite of it's best efforts to scare.

5585736,4,B00BEIYG98,"Good atmosphere and sense of foreboding and foreshadowing, the film makers and actors did a great job of establishing a normal, believable family, one that was likable and relate-able (the oldest son might be falling in with a bad crowd, the husband is having a hard time finding a job, the recession is  hitting the entire family hard). That strong sense of realistic normalcy - not screaming Oscar-winning ""You don't understand"" fights that some directors seem to like - is a hallmark to me of good horror/dark science fiction movies of this type; without a realistic world, with believable characters with some depth that you care about, nothing else really matters and it is hard to get into the movie.

The actual aliens were cool, creepy, and well, alien in both appearance and motivations. Some of the old tropes - marking the house with alien signs, birds acting strangely, the Dog ALWAYS knows - are done, but done well. I think this movie (not to give anything away) does by far the best in the whole ""lost time"" aspect of alien visitations, with one scene towards the end done extremely well.

This movie is comparable in feel and even in some scenes to Paranormal Activity, Signs, Poltergeist, and Mama, and those to me are good things...the kids know first, the parents/adults slowly catch on (some denial/disbelief is normal and perhaps even a good thing), and in the end they all fight to protect their family, even if everyone else thinks that they are crazy/criminal/abusive.

""Dark Skies"" works reasonably well for its first 45 minutes or so, until it collapses under the weight of redundancy, over-familiarity and a surfeit of alien-invasion silliness.

The always reliable Keri Russell (""The Americans"") and Josh Armstrong play the parents of two young boys whose peaceful suburban home is suddenly invaded by unknown creatures (think of it as ""Poltergeist,"" only with extraterrestrials rather than ghosts as the uninvited guests). The movie is intriguingly atmospheric in its early stages, as strange, inexplicable occurrences begin happening in the house, but the longer ""Dark Skies"" goes on, the less interesting it becomes, till, finally, we find ourselves awash in a sea of over-baked conspiracy-theory cliches. The ending is fairly admirable, I suppose, but by that point we're even more eager than the family is to hightail it out of that house for good.",1377302400,2,894,5.333333333333333

5585938,4,B00BEIYG98,"Dark skies is from the producer of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and Sinister.

I have to admit, for some reason (now I have no idea why, I must have read something wrong) I thought this was a TV show when I ordered it, I didn't realize it was a movie or I never would have got it (especially from the producer of the above movies, scary), because as I've become older, I've come to hate horror movies. Luckily, this one wasn't really horror, at least I wouldn't classify it that way. Sci-fi, paranormal perhaps, not horror, but still scary in it's own right.

It's about a husband and wife (Josh Hamilton and Keri Russell) who are a bit down on their luck, and their happy (kind of) family, who all of a sudden start having some crazy things happen, poltergeist style... or maybe not...

They soon realize they're up against something terrifying, and need to take matters into their own hands to figure out what's happening and how to stop it.

I don't want to give to much away, but this is a really good movie. It's not a slasher flick. It's a character driven sci-fi thriller that will make you sit on the edge of your seat and at times jump out of it. It's a movie that some may think could be a realistic future, which makes it even scarier.

Be careful reading other reviews, there are plot spoilers.

I recommend Dark Skies to horror and sci-fi fans alike. To those who like a good scare. To fans of Keri Russell and JK Simmons. Pop some corn, grab a beverage and if you're like me, have a blanket handy to cover your eyes at the scary parts.",1377129600,,1552,4.371527777777778

The story has a surprise twist at the end which I did not see coming, which is rare for me!  I enjoyed it a lot - and recommend it for any sci fi/alien/horror fan.

I probably would have given it 5 stars if it didn't have so much cross reference to Fourth Kind and Paranormal Activity as it's not a 100% original idea or format.",1377043200,,568,4.231481481481482

I found Dark Skies to be a lot better than expected - it's not predictable, it doesn't insult your intelligence (too much) and the scares are fairly genuine.

5586039,2,B00BEIYG98,"I hate to give a movie from this genre that is so highly produced only two stars when I have given more low-brow movies more stars (e.g. and most recently, ""The Pact"").  But this movie is just not scary.  Or original.  While watching it, I kept thinking about ""Poltergeist"" and at the end, I was thinking about how M. Night's ""Signs"" is actually a really good movie -- a much better movie than this in terms of humans confronting aliens.

""Dark Skies"" contains a lot of melodramatic plotting that really has nothing to do with anything.  The dad (Josh Hamilton) is unemployed and there are money problems and marital tensions between him and his otherwise stalwart wife (Keri Russell).  Their adolescent son hangs out with an older, tougher crowd and has a crush on a more experienced girl who also happens to be a family friend.  And meanwhile, weird things are happening in their house at night and their youngest son appears to be having a psychic break the subject of which causes more arguing amongst the grown-ups.  If none of this sounds scary or thrilling, that's because it isn't.  As I'm writing this I'm wondering if there were meant to be some ""The Shining""-type overtones here in terms of family relations, but the dad is actually a really nice (boring) guy.

There are some supernatural scenes, but it doesn't get more spooky than the contents of the refrigerator being displaced.  Three different flocks of birds fly into the house and die.  Eventually there's a big ""reveal"" at which point we already know everything anyway.  There's just no pay-off.  The build-up takes 85% of the movie and the finale -- where are the thrills and chills are supposed to pack a whollop -- takes about 10 minutes.  This is followed by a few brief final scenes that are supposed to represent a twist, but are just totally non-sensical.

What I was thinking about ""Poltergeist"" while watching this is that even with its bad 1980's special effects, it was still a more intrinsically thrilling and entertaining movie than ""Dark Skies.""  And I do hate to say that because ""Dark Skies"" is really well-made.  It just fell flat for me.",1376179200,,2126,4.730978260869565

5586042,5,B00BEIYG98,"THERE'S MORE Stephen King than Stephen Spielberg in this nifty thriller from the producers of the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise and ""Insidious."" It opens in a nice suburban neighborhood with a nice family - husband, wife, a teen, and an elementary school age son - and creepy things that go bump in the night. Just what is invading the house - ghosts, demons or something else?

Guessing is the fun/scary part of these flicks, if you haven't been spoiled already. I wasn't, so that heightened the suspense for me. Bottom line, I'd watch it again and share it with friends who like this kind of thing.

""Dark Skies"" starts slow - deliberately so according to commentary from writer/director Scott Steward, producer Jason Blum, executive producer Brian Kavanaugh-Jones and editor Peter Gvozdas. The point is to let viewers get to know the family played by Kerri Russell (Mom/Lacy), Josh Hamilton (Dad/Daniel), Dakota Goyo (teen son Jesse) and Kadan Rockett (youngest son Sam). Dad has been out of work and is actively looking for a job, Mom is a realtor who isn't selling, Jesse is exploring things he shouldn't - drugs and porn - with his buddy, the bad teen of the neighborhood, and young Sam is scared of the changes and arguments he overhears between his parents. They're not dysfunctional by any means; they're just trying to cope in tough times.

When Sam begins walking in his sleep and demonstrating odd behavior, it's a sign he needs help. ""How are we going to pay a therapist?"" Dad wants to know. We - the audience - know therapy won't help. Dad might be the last one to catch on to the bizarre events, but the family finally resorts to seeking out an expert played by the all-knowing J.K. Simmons.

Extras include nine alternate and deleted scenes that can be watched with or without commentary from Steward (""Legion""). They include an alternate ending, which adds a bit more detail. In commentary, Steward says he initially wrote ""Dark Skies"" as a found-footage film, but was convinced to change it to a third-person omniscient viewpoint by the producers. Viewers should enjoy the group commentary - we learn lots of stuff and its fun to hear.

While I felt it would probably be better than a few other recent horror movies, by bar level wasn't very high for it, and I proved correct.  The premise seemed very simple, but yet the trailers kinda pulled me into the theaters to see this film. I enjoyed that Keri Russell was in this it kinda intrigued me even more.  Congrats to the studio for  pure spooky trailers. Now onto the review. The problems I had with the film are, the script, cast, ending, and the suspense level. The script is good, well fairly, but I don't really get what Daniel getting a new job has to do with the plot of the film. I mean we have so much wasted time in the script, with stuff that has nothing to do with the premise. This is of aliens, haunting the family. I don't get why they put a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with this. I mean so we have the boy, Jesse and he's in this house and he's cupping this girls boob and then her kissing him for the first time. I mean what does that have to do with the premise? I know that it adds an emotional  statues  for Jesse, but I mean it literally  should have been shortened to include just the two kissing, I really don't  find the part where he's cupping her boob  very appropriate for the  movie subject. It would have been sweeter, and a sort of calming notion and to slow the pace, that the beginning had started to give the audience time to relax a little.  Plus it's sad that the script spent very little time with J.k Simmons character. He stole the show. Well now onto the cast. I mean you have a few wonderful cast members and others more  head ache prones. Well J.k Simmons was great as well as Keri Russell, and Kadan Rockett, as well as Dakota Goyo. But the problem with the cast is, Josh Hamilton, as Daniel, and L. J. Benet as Ratface or whatever they call him. Josh is just a headache. He has no idea what he's doing, and poor Keri has to do all the acting for him. He can't make anything realistic if it killed him. His acting is so wooden, that the only thing I liked about his time on screen was when he beat on the other actor I hated on screen, Ratface. L. J. is just plain old ugly, and his acting is even worse you can tell he's faking everything he says, and acts like he was rushed into a bus. Its ridicules! Now onto the ending. I really don't get it. It's set three months after the other ending.  So Keri and the little boy are in his room when the  little phone thingy goes off and starts saying who knows what. That's the thing that got me; I didn't understand anything it was saying. It was way too much jumbling and static. Well at least Keri understood it, because the viewers surely didn't. But what I did like about it is that Keri finds out that they wanted Jesse all along. That I found wrapped up the mystery. As I've mentioned is that the script added scenes that didn't really belong, which brought down the suspense level, of the movie. It did pretty well over all but the suspense went up and down way too much.  Now to get onto the brighter side of the movie, which includes, cast, length, character development, scares, and suspense.  The cast is included on both the worst and best. Because half the cast is great. Keri Russell and J.K Simmons are the high lights of the cast. Dakota Goyo is also good. Keri Russell picks up the slack from half of the cast. She adds much of the suspense, and she actually seems like she is enjoying every minute on set. She was excellent, and kept this movie from going to 2 stars. Keri Russell could not do everything you know, J.K Simmons also steamed up the late middle towards the end, with a horrorific performance.  He freaking scared me to death, with his creepy kinda alien informer kinda cat dude. Loved him. Also overall the kid performers in this movie were a bit above bad too. They weren't great but with a little bit more acting classes and they'd be stars like Keri and J.k! The length is suited very well. I think they knew how to not make it too long, so as to not lose viewers. But not too short, as to include more chills.  So that was well spot on! The character development was spot on for all the characters. You really feel for every character even the less well acted (Daniel, Ratface). I felt a lot for one character more so then others. That would be Jesse. I felt how much pressure he had on him, and that he was very emotional. I felt when he was happy; I felt his character so much that I cried at the end. While the tear was small it was still a tear! I never do that during most horror movies. I just don't feel anything for the characters in horror films except for them being another body bag to add to the pile.  This film promises  some really good scares, and I feel them. My arm hairs stood up when Daniel went into the room to check on Sammy, and Sammy had no eyes. It was scary as hell. And when the birds flew into the window, man that was an original fright, and unexpected actually.  The part with J.K Simmons was also pretty spooky. The suspense level is good and bad. Bad, as I already explained, and good, because I felt the chills even to start. Even though the suspense went up and down it went up more than down for me. All an All this horror movie is smarter than the average horror film but not that higher up. C+",1375228800,,5418,4.196342637151107

I had a pretty good notion of what this film was about and I had really thought maybe this was going to deliver something new that I hadn't seen before. The story was interesting enough for a decent viewing experience & it did have some good frightening scenes spread thinly throughout. Overall it was mainly a psychological thriller and was hardly a horror film, so if you're thinking you're going to be in for any kind of brilliant sci-fi visual experience you won't get much more than very thin ""shades"" of the most commonly used interpretations of what an alien being looks like. Also don't expect any visual horror scenes because there is little more than a bit of head banging. With a budget of $3.5 million the film relied heavily on story & acting, but laid off on the CGI. Overall it's cast did a fine job & it's production value was as good as any other Hollywood film. While I believe it will hold peoples attention, I doubt many people will be walking out of the theater saying wow or OMG brilliant! The plot was very similar to many other alien abduction films, which made it somewhat predictable right down to the final scene, which contained little more than a very very slight turn of events.

I really didn't know what to expect but assumed it would be a ""scary"" movie because of the comparisons and horror movie previews shown at the beginning of the dvd.  I used to absolutely love horror movies but have gotten away from them.  I was a little concerned that it might be too scary for the me of today.  Have no fear (heehee) -- it was not a frightening movie or anything at all that really resembled a horror movie.

I absolutely love Keri Russell (was a HUGE fan of Felicity when it was on), and she did not disappoint.  She is such an incredibly gifted actress.  Dark Skies has kind of the same feeling/atmosphere as some of M Night Shyamalan's movies such as Signs or The Village (but not nearly as creepy as Sixth Sense).

When the movie began, I assumed that the ""culprits"" of the family's issues would be ghosts.  I was surprised to find out the true cause of their problems.  I thought this was a very good movie but have to admit that I was unhappy with the ending.  I know that it is made for a sequel, but I felt that a little move need to be covered in the ending.

But then, 2 minutes before the movie ends, they decide to flip the switch and ruin the whole thing with an ending that made very little sense, was hardly related to the plot, and left me wondering if they were making a second one, or if they were just stupid enough to make it seem like they were.

The thing is, even though the basics are the same, each family has its own personality and therefore its own ways of dealing with the situation; THAT'S what makes every one of these stories so interesting.

There's the usual ""pooh pooh'ing"" of the strange things that are happening, then the dawning realization that things just aren't normal. Instances of marks and bruising on the youngest boy that aren't attributable to parents or accidents, 3 separate flocks of birds flying into the house at the same time (hundreds of bloody splats all over the windows and outside of the house...yuk!) and finally Mom experiencing 6 hours of 'missing time', the youngest son going into a sort of trance at his soccer game, Dad having a (non)sleep-walking incident ending in blood pouring from his nose, eventually pushes her to looking for answers.

At the near end of the movie, she winds up finding an expert in extraterrestrial abductions who has been studying the phenomena for decades (a whole wall of newspaper clippings are evidence of his interest) who explains that by the time people realize what's going on, it's usually been happening to at least one person in the family for years...and generally ends in abduction. He tries to guide them in how to avoid an abduction by urging them to physically stay together as much as possible, to make it harder for ET to separate the target.

The ending was totally unexpected, though. You think you know who the target is and then, ""Wha-a-a-t??"", you're wrong!

Of course, the viewer is going to be yelling at the movie's characters, ""WHY ARE YOU SENDING THE KIDS TO THEIR ROOM, YOU IDIOTS!"" and ""OMG! DIDN'T THE GUY TELL YOU TO STICK TOGETHER?! FIRST  YOU SEND THE KIDS OUT OF THE ROOM AND NOW YOU'RE ALL ""'STAY HERE, HONEY, WHILE I CHECK THE YARD'"" ????

5586510,3,B00BEIYG98,"Absolutely everything about this movie has been done before. However, Dark Skies is just about as good as any other in the genre (with the possible exception of Signs which I still believe to be the very best of this sort of movie). It does a good job of building tension... despite being utterly predictable. That sounds like a paradox but was my experience none the less.

So here is what disappointed me about the movie: Dark Skies spends quite a number of scenes trying to establish it's characters. A worthwhile effort but ultimately a failed one. None of them are personable, relatable, or particularly interesting and nothing that happens to any of them at any point serves to do anything more than say ""look how difficult this is getting"".

It took a LOT of inspiration from signs. I won't say which scenes so as to let the movie be as fresh as possible for you but I will say that Every one of them was better in every way in Signs.

Also, for a family who are supposed to be really struggling financially, these folks have no trouble investing in hi-tech security systems and surveillance equipment (for some paranormal activity style scenes).

Despite these negatives I still enjoyed watching it and was appropriately tense for much of the movie.",1372896000,,1257,4.7

5586565,2,B00BEIYG98,"Seen 'Poltergeist'? Seen 'Signs'? Seen 'Paranormal Activity'? Then guess what - you do not need to see DARK SKIES, which is a collage of all of the above. Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton star as Lacy and Daniel Barrett, an ordinary suburban couple with two young sons - teenaged Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and young Sam (Kadan Rockett). All seems well and normal until, one night a restless Lacy gets up to find the back door unlocked and most of the contents of the fridge all over the floor. Afraid they had a break-in, the next night Lacy and Daniel make sure the house is locked up tight ... only to have Lacy come downstairs in the middle of the night, again, to find what appears to be a freaky geometric sculpture, made from all the cans and bottles, etc. in the cupboards and fridge, waiting for her downstairs.

The cops have no explanation, the Barretts have no explanation (Daniel Barrett, as played by Josh Hamilton, also happens to be one of the most ineffective, lame fathers ever depicted in a suspense film), and when four different flocks of birds spend aobut ten minutes flying directly into (and all over) the Barrett home, even the neighbors begin to wonder who the hell they're living next to.

A couple jump scares are kind of cool, but this is by no means a horror film, and the plodding story takes its time until you actually spot a ""creature"" - and through the whole thing I just had the sense that I'd seen all this before ... and done much better in other films. I never do spoilers, so don't want to give too much away, but even by the time Lacy and Daniel sit down to talk with an expert in possible alien infestation (J.K. Simmons), I had just checked out of the film and was hoping for an ending that would blow me away, at least. No such luck; even the slight ""twist"" at the end was already given away if you've seen so much as the trailer or a certain version of the film's poster, the even slighter twist after it (setting us up for a possible sequel) even more of a yawn.

I really wanted to like this. I really couldn't. Russell and young Rockett especially give it their all, but there is just nothing original - or all that interesting - here.",1372636800,,2174,4.389578163771712

The upside to the story is that they actually go into the actual information on the subject of extraterrestrial entities and what is known about the whole abduction phenomenon.  That is why I gave it an extra star because it didn't get too Hollywood, but kept it's feet on the ground.  If you are just looking for pure escapist entertainment, then you will be disappointed.

Cave paintings hundreds of thousands of years old, religious stories, The Holy Bible, The Holy Qur'an, The Bhagavad Gita, different societies and cultures around they world report ""the people from the sky"" came to us and taught us these things. Friend-foe? who knows. But one thing for sure is I have personally experienced events which speaks to this (unreality?) vrs. Reality.
No I am not crazy, the acting was good, the story reflects what's being reported globally. That means, for some of you...around the world. I give the movie a five star rating not so much for acting, which was good, (the kids were amazing in the movie) and the special effects also. But 5 stars for the Illuminati, the Government working with Hollywood, and the screen writers for telling us (what I see is) The truth. All around the world major countries (developing and Super Powers) have been releasing their UFO files. The United States does it with Movies, music videos (Katy Perry and Kanye West song 'Extraterrestrial') entertainment and false alleged purported 'leaks' on You Tube and social media around the world. People it's okay to think ""he's mad crazy."" I've seen the other side with my own eyes...I'm still alive to share this with you. Wake up, the disease of distraction has blinded the billions to this ultimate reality- The Human Race Has Been Covertly Conquered By A Power We As A People and Global Community Cannot Fight. 5 Stars for all those in power to bring us the truth to a society addicted to music, movies, videos and all social media (guilty as charged) and we have been blindly living to a reality many of us cannot cope with. This movie opens with ""Two possibilities exist... Either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying. - Arthur C. Clarke; and from whats being reported around the world, and the information 'leakage' provided from Governments around the world- Is that we are not alone, and a power greater than the human race has Covertly Conquered Us as a species...and millions upon millions are clueless.

The cast is what differentiates Dark Skies from the rest of the horror movies, which can be be pretty painful if not done properly. I thought Keri Russell was a bit of an odd fit, but it worked. J.K. Simmons was also entertaining as always, even if he does kind of always play the same sarcastic witty kind of character.

Dark Skies isn't going to be a classic, but it's worth a watch if you're into horror movies. I'm not sure how much money I'd pay to see it it, but the cast is good and the thrills are there. Definitely worth a watch.",1372377600,2,778,4.145695364238411

The acting is excellent. Keri Russell is always fantastic. J.K. Simmons was good in his minor role, he played his character just right, very serious, not wacky or over the top. Overall the film is really good quality. I like that the film didn't rely on jump scares. Good build up without rushing into the action, not so determined to scare its audience that it gives up on the plot, and no excessive gore.

How the story unfolds is pretty typical for a horror movie; youngest child is the trigger, mom finds the wild explanation, father is the skeptical jerk, and a ""twist"" ending. Fairly predictable.

This was a good sci-fi/paranormal mixture. If you're into aliens and horror films then this is definitely the movie for you.

It's entertaining enough that I would watch it if it was on, however I wouldn't buy it. But my thing is that I'm really not into aliens, at all. So let me say that despite my dislike of anything to do with aliens, I still gave this movie three stars.

5587033,4,B00BEIYG98,"Horror films have developed many different flavors over the years. There's supernatural horror, psychological horror, found footage, and so many more.

Dark Skies falls into the category of science-fiction horror, which is familiar ground for people who've watched TV shows like Fringe (or the X-Files, depending on your generation). This kind of horror isn't for everyone, as evidenced by the mixed reviews Dark Skies has gotten. However, it made back its production budget at the box office several times over, so clearly there's an audience for this particular flavor of horror movie.

Some might be turned off at the idea of a horror movie being PG-13, but if the story is done well, horror movies don't need buckets of blood or rampant cursing.

PLOT:

Our tale takes place in the suburbs, with husband and wife Daniel & Lacy (played by Josh Hamilton and Keri Russell), and their two boys Jessie and Sammy (played by Dakota Goyo and Kadan Rockett). There's some existing strain on the family since Daniel has been out of work for about three months, and Lacy is struggling to hold on to her realty job. Jessie is going through the awkwardness of his early teens, but still makes the time to tell bedtime stories to his little brother Sammy through their walkie-talkies.

Strange, unexplained things start happening to this family - stacks of cans appear in their kitchen for no reason, every sensor of the house alarm is tripped at the same time but no one is found in the house, and in one particularly unsettling sequence, every single picture is removed from their frames on the first floor of the house. After a while, each family member finds themselves personally affected by things they can't explain.

It's clear that someone or something is targeting this family, and over the course of the film, we see everyone's horror and panic grow as their safety slips away.

WHAT DID I THINK?

I thought Dark Skies took a slow-build approach to its horror, and it didn't take the cheap way out with jump scares or shaky-camera footage. The horror took its time, building very slowly over the course of the movie with unsettling imagery. As a parent, the greatest fear I have is being helpless to protect my children...and the director tapped into this fear with unsettling horrific events that couldn't be explained or protected against, such as the time-loss/possession moments or the children being covered with bruises and brandings.

In horror films, you either care about the characters, or you want them to meet a well-deserved death. I found myself caring about every main character in Dark Skies, which is not easy for a horror film to pull off. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Kadan Rockett as Sammy...he was able to adapt to whatever the scenes required, and I felt he reacted just as an actual six-year old child would act - whether it was screaming, silence, or happiness over the family getting a new dog.

The character of Edwin Pollard (played by J.K. Simmons) was a real treat. This type of movie requires an ""expert"" on what's happening, and he played the role perfectly...no overacting, no underplay, just right. I was starting to lost interest in the film partway through, but his character brought me back and got me refocused...he wanted to do what he could to help, and he was very honest with Daniel & Lacy about their fears.

The ending, I'll admit, wasn't what I expected, and I won't lie, I was disappointed. Everyone has a different reaction to an ending like this one, so I'll let you make your own decisions on that.

BONUS FEATURES:

There's one audio commentary track with the following people -

(1) Scott Stewart (writer/director)
(2) Jason Blum (producer)
(3) Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (executive producer)
(4) Peter Gvodas (picture editor)

The commentary track is quite good. Several topics are discussed, such as their decision to not make this a ""found footage"" film, their schedule of 6 months from shooting to release in theaters, giving creative control to the actors, explaining how to shoot ""night shots"" in the daytime, and much more. Overall, a good track, but I wish we could have had a 2nd track with the actors to hear their thoughts, character motivations, etc.

There's also 9 deleted/alternate scenes with optional commentary. Lots of these sequences were cut because they disrupted the pacing of the movie and the overall tone. There's also an alternate ending...it'll be up to you to decide which one is better.

MY FINAL VERDICT?

All in all, Dark Skies did what it set out to do, to unsettle its audience. However, it's a one-time viewing for folks like me.

Initially I was going to give this movie 3 stars, but the solid performances by the actors and the extra features rounded it up to 4 stars.

If you like your horror movies with Pinheads or found footage or buckets of blood and gore, this definitely isn't your movie. However, if you're looking to try a different flavor of horror, I'd recommend Dark Skies for a rental. Who knows, you might like it.",1371945600,,5024,4.840140023337223

Overall, I thought it was pretty well-acted / directed / produced. Though I didn't feel like there was a huge payoff in the end. And the ending seemed to leave more questions than answers... No real resolution.

As far as the DVD release goes, it was okay. There were some deleted scenes that were probably deleted for a reason. And I guess there was a commentary track, though I rarely listen to those, except if I'm bored.

Overall, I'd say it was okay...",1371945600,,560,4.524752475247524

Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton are Lacy and Daniel Barrett,  suburban parents of two buys who start to experience very odd events occurring in their home and around their family. At first they are unsure of what is going on and start to think one of the boys is having some emotional difficulties. When things start to really get out of control, they find they must confront what is terrorizing them and fight back.

 Dark Skies is  a supernatural thriller that has something for everyone.  It has elements of the paranormal mixed  with lots of suspense.  I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of creepiness that is throughout this movie.
I truly was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I felt  elements of Paranormal Activity (It doesn't hurt that the films share a producer) and also Signs, yet this movie is in a category all it's own.

There is excellent acting from everyone, including J.K. Simmons, as a man who helps the Barretts come to terms with what exactly it is they are dealing with because he has been through similar experiences, himself.

Some excellent execution of dramatic music combined with a foreboding sense of dread.  This, aided by decent special effects and not-horrible acting gives this movie 4 stars.

Storyline: Not bad. A family experiences odd happenings and tries to deal with them. (I am vague on purpose).

Writing: Much better than most scary movies.

Acting: Pretty good. Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton totally carry this movie and if not for them, this movie would have been a total bomb. The two kids need a few more acting lessons.

Graphics/Special Effects: They are ok and rare. Mostly fleeting glimpses of ""(no spoilers)"". This is intentional.

The majority of this movie is pretty good and kept my attention. Near the ending, it gets a bit odd and difficult to follow and understand but they do make things clear in the last few minutes. I really did not care much for the last 10-15 minutes.

The director used thriller-horror-mystery skills and techniques to great effect. It seemed like an X-files spin-off to some degree, but then suddenly we know more about the psychological effects of an abduction. That character development made the difference.",1371340800,,398,5.419354838709677
5587268,4,B00BEIYG98,"The trailers for this movie suggested to me that this movie might be a fun creep-fest.  In general, I do think this movie was suitably creepy and well worth watching.

The entire movie is spent building or ramping up the brooding and creepy atmosphere.  The movie begins slowly as the director explains that, as with many families, this family has issues.  The problems the family has ramp up rapidly with the introduction of creepy household events.  At first, the events that happen seem as though they could be explained by the presence of children, or a husband or wife forgetting that they did something, but it takes very little time for the weird factor to ramp to the point where the explanations could not be pranks, or even rational.

Perhaps the real brilliance of this movie is the very sparse and effective use of the antagonist.  The director provides shadows, blurry images, and brief glimpses at just the right moment to provide chills when you realize that the thing that is there was not there a moment ago.

I usually provide much more detail in film reviews than I plan to provide in this one, but because there are many details, and the fun in watching this movie is seeing the details unfold, I defer the fun to a viewer rather than me providing plot spoilers.

Several other movies have tried to do what this movie does, though much less successfully.  I have seen some reviewers compare this movie with SIGNS, which I think is an awful comparison.  In SIGNS, aliens travel light years and have all sorts of powers, but are unable to overcome a cheap lock on a door and succumb to a trick that is at least as old as THE WIZARD OF OZ.  The antagonists in this film have no difficulties in getting past locked doors, alarms, etc.  Another comparison is with the movie POLTERGEIST, which is probably a closer comparison, though with differences a viewer needs to discover.

If you enjoy a movie where the tensions build, atmosphere is a critical feature of the film, and you brain is preferably engaged as you try to understand the events in the film, then this movie could be one for you.  If you need spurting blood, explosions, flashing knives, enough stunt men to fill a stadium, and thinking should be avoided if possible, then this movie is not for you.

5587367,4,B00BEIYG98,"""Dark Skies"" was a suspenseful and entertaining watch with enough scares to keep me glued to the screen. The suburban setting with the neat houses,manicured lawns, and ordinary people makes for a perfect contrast to the nightmare that one family is soon to experience. Keri Russell (of ""Felicity"" and lately ""The Americans"") plays Lacy Barrett, who is married to Daniel (Josh Hamilton). The couple have two sons, teenager Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and young Sam (Kadan Rockett). The family is experiencing financial problems since Daniel has been laid off from his job and they have to rely on Lacy's income as a real estate agent. Suddenly, the family begins experiencing strange events such as the refrigerator being raided by something unknown, the contents of the pantry being arranged in a mysterious way, and so on.

The suspense in the first hour builds slowly but I actually liked the way things were set up. Though I could guess what was going on, it was interesting to watch how the parents, Lacy and Daniel discover the true nature of the mysterious occurrences. There are some truly creepy moments and anyone who has ever watched episodes of the X-Files dealing with alien encounters will be able to appreciate the attention to details in this film. It may not be original in its conception, but I felt the execution was above average. The main players all did a credible job in their respective roles, especially Keri Russell as the beleaguered mom who tries desperately to come to terms with what is going on. J.K. Simmons turns in a noteworthy performance as the resident expert, Edwin Pollard who tries to help the Barrett family. Falling between horror and sci-fi, ""Dark Skies"" merits a watch - it has a decent plot, credible acting, and plenty of suspense.",1370995200,,1768,4.8933333333333335
5587458,4,B00BEIYG98,"Both me and my husband really enjoyed this movie. I deliberately went out of my way to avoid knowing anything about the plot, so I had no idea what the movie was about and that made it much better. I had seen the movie trailer on television when this was in the theaters, but I figured it was just another lame horror flick. I was wrong. In the horror/thriller/sci-fi genres, my expectations are generally pretty low since so many poor movies are made, but this one is worth your time.

*Just don't read any reviews giving away the story line and it will be much more interesting and entertaining when you watch it, since you won't really know what to expect.

If you like movies that gradually build suspense with more nuance than gore, you will truly enjoy this film. I actually prefer these type of movies because I get all of the suspense without a bunch of disgusting images in my head that I can never seem to get rid of. Don't get me wrong, you will see some blood, but no bloody images that will keep you up at night or cause you to feel sick. I do not like gore-filled horror movies. Can you tell? This one's a keeper. I even recommended this movie to a few people, and they rented it from Amazon and reported back that they enjoyed this movie, too.

You will likely feel you've seen a lot of the scenes before in other horror/sci-fi movies, but even so, the payoff is satisfying. The actors are great. Good direction, etc. You won't find yourself distracted or messing with your phone. This movie gets your attention within the first few minutes and keeps it straight until the end.",1370995200,,1592,4.426621160409557
5587459,3,B00BEIYG98,"There are so many references to the name dark skies in science fiction. This plotline also brings in the idea of the grays and follows along with other storylines of a family besieged by unknown forces.

Strange things are happening to the Barretts. They live in a suburban community, the houses are close together, but it seems strange no one else notices the lights and problems that go on; even a flock of suicidal birds seems to generate little interest. The movie is so low key, even as the husband and wife find thing getting stranger and stranger, do they really talk about it - no? Does the husband ask his wife to look behind his ear at what he thinks might be a bite or is it something else? It becomes curiouser and curiouser on the part of everyone. The movie is creepy and the acting is well done.
The ending seems to be almost dropped in there, as if time ran out for them to do the movie. Yet fans of the occult and alien might enjoy this.

The DVD has English and Spanish subtitles. There are extras of alternate and deleted scenes with the optional choice for commentary which is interesting, however the deleted scenes do not seem that much different from what is already in the movie.",1370995200,,1203,4.4389140271493215
5587460,4,B00BEIYG98,"DARK SKIES

""Dark Skies"" is a really interesting movie from director Scott Stewart who is the man that brought us ""Legion"" and Priest"". I really liked both of those films so I was pretty sure that I would enjoy this one. Now I do like Alien films and paranormal stuff so that was also going for this flick. The thing is regardless of I how felt before going in I didn't really remember much about this flick. I could not remember much from the trailer or the marketing so I was kinda blank going in.

The Barrett's are your average family living in the suburbs with your average problems. The man of the house needs a new job and the mom is taking care of everything else really. Of course your problems are only normal and average before things start to go bump in the night. Of course the children are effect the most by this and seem to be talking to people who are not there. Things in the house are getting moved around and it seems someone is breaking into the house on a nightly basis. Thing is there is no evidence of someone actually breaking in. as things escalate especially with the youngest child tension rises and the family is put to the test.

I really did like this film and found it to be very entertaining but it is not a perfect movie. Still it is a good film with great production values and performances all around. Also since I have been of this horror kick lately this one fitted right in with that. I liked how this film built to the conclusion slowly instead of rushing things. That is one of my favorite things about great horror films, most don't do that anymore. I thought Josh Hamilton did a good job here playing the father and husband who believe that his family is falling apart around him. Keri Russell may be the best here though with an excellent portrayal of the terrified mother. The kids and supporting actors are really good as well and it was cool to see J.K. Simmons. He plays the ""expert"" on the things that are plaguing the family and their household.
This film is a good one that I would recommend to any horror fan out there. The DVD comes with deleted scenes and a great audio commentary. I am one of those people that loves to watch the movie with the commentary. So I would recommend picking up the DVD and such. If you are in the mood for this kinda flick check it out.",1370995200,,2319,4.314220183486238

The film is well paced and uses sound effectively.  The actors give quality performances throughout especially a morose J.K. Simmons.  This is a menacing little flick and to its credit doesn't abuse the home security camera gimmick, using it instead as a singular plot point.

Despite some small and not too obtrusive plot-holes, DARK SKIES has some interesting premises and developments as to what's going on. There is also some nicely done foreshadowing in certain seemingly small details and bits of dialogue in the early parts of this well-directed and well-produced film.

America's present economic woes provide a good backdrop and contribute well to DARK SKIES's plot. The ending kind of drops off, but not too abruptly, leaving room for sequel(s). The acting is at least decent, and in the case of the teenagers--particularly Annie Thurman as the spirited, somewhat abrasive, but still very believable modern 13/14-year-old Shelly Jessop--quite good.

Most importantly, I suppose, DARK SKIES is genuinely tense and frightening.",1370995200,,1796,7.799019607843137

That said, this one, while really good in quality, seemed to slighly miss the mark in scariness.  Part of that may be due to some actions (or lack of actions) by it main actors... vs what you would expect of yourself in the same situation.

5587467,3,B00BEIYG98,"From the opening moments of this movie, I couldn't help but feel that I'd been here before.  We begin with the normal family having odd things happening.  The fridge is raided at night, but only the vegetables are taken.  The cans are stacked like a geometry project, all the photos are gone.  Mom starts to get a bit freaked out, but dad is far too ""logical"" to see what is happening.  There must be some other explanation.  After all of the alarms are tripped, but no doors are opened, after the youngest son starts reporting visits from the ""Sand Man,"" after said son is found walking away outside (just after mom sees a shape standing over him in one of the most chilling scenes of the movie), mom convinces dad that they need to see a psychic, er, no an exorcist, no, wait, this time it's a UFO expert.

What they've done here is taken material from Paranormal Activity, The Fourth Kind, and Fire in the Sky, and mashed it together into a passable suspense film.  I think that if you haven't seen any of the above films, you'll likely enjoy this one quite a bit.  It is a cut above the Fourth Kind, but nowhere near Paranormal Activity in creepiness.  Don't let the PG-13 rating sway you, however, as this is not for the kids.  There is little to no gore (some bloody noses and the aftermath of a massacre scene at the end, which isn't what you think, so I haven't ruined anything for you here), but it is sure to result in little sleep for kids afterwards.

There is a twist at the end, and while I don't intend to ruin that for you, I did find it a pretty predictable ""twist.""",1370908800,,1583,4.328813559322034

5587543,4,B00BEIYG98,"This movie is not really a horror movie.  It has no blood.  It has no gore.  There is no evil thing that hacks and slashes its way through the movie.  This is a type of movie that has become prevalent as of late that is more thriller than horror and more psychological than scary.  The horror is more from what you don't see than what you do.  What you feel than what is actually happening.  The dread and the hopelessness of the situation.

The movie just wouldn't work if you did not feel for the family.  If you didn't understand them.  If you couldn't be them...and that's what makes the movie work; because just about every single one of us can be them.  There is nothing special about them.  The husband is between jobs and the wife is barely hanging on to hers.  The older son is in the middle of his first love and the younger son is well the younger son.  They are a perfectly normal American family.

And then it all falls apart.

And they don't know why.

That is what made the movie interesting for me.  That is what made it worth watching and what made it worth watching again.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good thriller.  This is not horror people or maybe it is.  Because isn't losing your family the most horrible thing there is?",1370822400,6,1268,4.288135593220339
5587544,3,B00BEIYG98,"'Dark Skies' is a scifi movie that is capitalizing on the recent horror trend.  Aliens are invading and harassing a suburban family.  Tired plot.  The addition of horror movie styling makes for an interesting angle, but it just leaves both genres half-baked.  Replace 'alien' with 'demon' or 'ghost' and you have just another 'Paranormal Activity'.  The alien presence is interesting, but they invade using possession techniques and anomalies of nature (such as the hundreds of birds running into the house from the trailer).  As such, it's hard to be scared by anything because 'fictional' aliens are causing the havoc, but it's also hard to get behind the 'universe' in a scifi sense because of the horror styling.

Keri Russell and her on-screen children do a decent job of playing an unassuming, typical middle-American family, but Josh Hamilton as the father of the family just doesn't do anything for me.  I don't sympathize with his character, and he's constantly making the kind of choices that have you yelling 'COME ON!' at the screen.  Boring.

I liked the pacing of the film. They don't waste any time getting to the first alien contact (just a few minutes in to the film).  As a thriller, the plot moves around and throws you a bone now and then to keep things interesting.  The 'twist' is easy to spot, and it's hard to believe the characters don't pick up on it earlier.  JK Simmons shows up late in the film as a no-nonsense alien expert, and he's always great.

If 'Dark Skies' came out before the demonic horror trend of late, it would get another star on style and pacing, but right now it just feels like we've been there a dozen times already.  More horror than 'Signs' and less personality.",1370822400,,1712,4.736486486486487

This film rings true of some of the best and most understatedly intense early Steven Spielberg movies, like Close Encounters and Poltergeist. A lot of attention was given to plot development rather than special effects, in the sense that it quietly builds itself into a insidious climax through a series of menacing events, at first slight but rather quickly escalated. It's not that that the effects are bad, btw, they just aren't needed. MUCH BETTER than the Paranormal Activity movies, as well.

A number of us are fans of the alien abduction / visitation genre. So I jumped at the chance to get this DVD when it was offered to me.

I have to say I never seen the other films by this producer (the Paranormal Activity movies). The impression I got was those were just scary haunted house movies - where something pops out and says 'boo'.. But since watching Dark Skies, I can see where there is more to these movies than that. There was a number of times watching this movie where I did jump a bit. Scares aside, this is a pretty well done alien movie. The story starts out pretty benign, and then ramps up dramatic to a very intense ending. I liked it. The only one small distraction for me was the actor that they used for the conspiracy expert - I've seen him in too many insurance commercials.

The DVD comes with a sparse amount of special features, just alternate & deleted scenes and an audio commentary with the writer/director, executive producer, and editor. There is an alternate ending, that I thought wasn't as good as the one that they used in the film - but it was interesting to watch. The audio commentary is good (I tend to watch / listen to those when they are available). Listening to it.

I find each of them to be highly entertaining in their own way.  To certain degree, Dark Skies is based on that shared believe but placed in a much darker scenario.  Although this particular story is not associated with a ""true account"", the story will seem familiar to those accustomed to The X-Files and others realistic alien sci-fi movies & TV.  I think the actors are well played and the pacing builds nicely.  For those that are not fans of this genre, then the horror aspect could become stale.  I do recommend it to Sci-Fi fans, over hardcore horror fans.  Being a PG-13 movie, this feels more like a tense thriller (which I personally enjoy a lot).  The slow build up pays off more for those that enjoy this sub-genre of Sci-Fi horror.  I personally think they should make more movies like this - and hopefully a sequel to this could be possible.

These events start off small then they escalate to include the whole family. The parents, Daniel and Lacey Barret, investigate what has been going on in their home but also to them personally. Time has been lost for the characters, strange illnesses, and animal activity is just some of things things they must endure. Will this family survive an attack that is supernatural? How will they protect themselves from something that is not of their world? The only way to find out is to grab a copy and see for yourself.

I have been a fan of actress Keri Russell since her 'Felicity' days and have enjoyed watching her over the years as she moves into more adult and serious roles. Watching her in the 'Americans' has been a huge treat for our home for we just love her as a touch no nonsense women who can also kick your ass. When I first saw the previews for 'Dark Skies' I got really excited to see her up on the big screen in a serious/horror movie, and I was not disappointed. Her acting was amazing and the husband and wife chemistry made this movie feel very real for me. I loved the fact that when Keri's character (Lacey Barret) discovers who these beings are and shares with her husband (Josh Hamilton playing Daniel Barret) that he actually reacts like ""Really? This is what you think is going on? You can't be serious, this is not the movies"" attitude. The children (Dakota Goyo and Kadan Rockett who play Jesse and Sam Barret) where also wonderful actors who really pulled you into the story. I enjoyed their brother to brother nightly radio stories but also how they responded when confronted by others regarding these strange events. Great acting all around and a different type of tale that you would normally see. My favorite part of this story is when the family decides to fight back, which you don't often see in the genre.

I really enjoyed the bonus features, which include a ton of deleted scenes. My favorite scene is the alternate ending... after I watched that I feel if this ending was in fact the original shows ending it would give a whole new feel to the movie. I found it so interesting that one scene could change how I felt at the end. I highly suggest that you watch the alternate ending after you finish the movie to see for yourself how you feel. Does this alternate ending take away hope from this movie? Does it make it seem there is a higher chance of a second movie vs the first ending? The only way to find out for yourself is to watch the original movie and then see the alternate ending.",1370390400,,2639,4.473029045643154

During the scene in the hallway with the mother heading to the bedroom... I actually had to pause and step away and take a break.

The excellent pacing built the suspense to the climax nicely and the acting felt life-like.  What I found most impressive was that the movie felt realistic and wasn't special effect flashy.  Even the reactions of the ancillary characters was what I would expect from the neighbors on my street given the circumstances.  That realism was a hallmark in those early Spielberg works of art Poltergeist and Close Encounters.  Recognizing that is probably why many people have made that comparison.  I would however say it felt more like a little cousin of Spielberg's Taken (the mini-series) mixed with a dash of M. Knight's Signs.",1370131200,2,827,4.913669064748201
5588018,4,B00BEIYG98,"""Dark Skies""  is a science fiction/horror tale about a family targeted and tormented by alien beings.  Daniel (Josh Hamilton) and Lacy Barrett (Keri Russell), a suburban couple with kids, witness an escalating series of disturbing events involving their family and their peaceful, safe haven of a home.  Unexplained, harmless occurrences soon evolve into unimaginable terror as the aliens' goal becomes clear:  child snatching.

The film moves along with an eerie atmosphere and the occasional scare, but too much is derivitave of other movies, particularly Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" with nods to Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, and ""Poltergeist.""  The aliens in ""Dark Skies"" prefer to toy with the occupants of an average household before their ultimate goal is realized.  Why they would diddle around so much is never made clear.

Though the plot is far from novel, director Scott Stewart (""Priest,"" ""Legion"") offers some interesting touches.  The film can be a commentary on uncertain times, with the aliens focusing on troubled families.  Dad has lost his job as an architect, Mom is doing poorly in the real estate business, bills are piling up, one of their teenage sons is watching porn and keeping bad company, and the kids start seeing ghosts.  The last thing the Barretts need is uninvited, nasty visitors.

This film does not disappoint.

A interesting plot, well acted, well scripted, and well directed, this movie surprised, started, and creeped me out through the entire length. There were wonderfully few cheap ""jump-scares"" - which most scary movies tend to use in abundance - and more than enough creepy ambiance to keep you on the edge of your seat. I found myself thinking multiple times throughout the movie ""whoa, I did not expect that!"" which is a rarity in modern horror movies.

There are some cliches were there, creating weird tones i.e., ""What's happening us?!"" and clutching her husbands chest and crying. The angry, frustrated dad, constantly losing his cool to make up for his lack of intelligence... just hacky. It lost 1/2 star for me for that. One person said this movie ripped off the movie Poltergeist. I couldn't see the comparison. Poltergeist also didn't get great reviews when it came out. A lot of those movies that people are comparing this one to weren't considered good movies at the time. In our minds they became better. Critics are constantly underrating horror films, which is why people aren't in a rush to make bigger budget intelligent Sci-fi, Horror, Fantasy film.

The old veteran abductee was the only character with any depth.  But the Grays only appeared for a total of about one minute, tops--and no UFOs, not one.
I prefer Bryce Zabel's tv series ""Dark Skies"" to this title rip-off.

The Barretts are your everyday normal, struggling family trying to keep up appearances. When their youngest son starts talking about The Sandman, life takes a decidedly left turn for all of them.
 This very entertaining movie sucked me in even when I tried to remain emotionally disconnected. It's been a long time since I watched a film in this genre and it really got into my head. Some weird little things happen in the story line that are tip offs that something bigger is coming. Days later, when weird little things happen around my house, I start thinking of the movie all over again.
If you're a fan of sci-fi, X Files or thoughts along those lines, you might like this. The movie was really well done and just enough special effects to keep me wondering what was around every corner... and sometimes, following them down the corridor. The children in Dark Skies were just as compelling as the adults.

The disc contains Special features: Alternate and deleted scenes, commentary with writer/director Scott Stewart, producer Jason Blum, and others, which I can't wait to see.

Even though it's rated PG 13, I wouldn't recommend this as a family movie to watch with kids (or anyone) who is subject to nightmares. The cover art alone is disconcerting enough and since I saw the movie I can't stand to look at it. It ends on a slightly fatalistic note with just enough thread hanging loose to wonder if there will be a follow up.

5588101,4,B00BEIYG98,"It would not be surprising if a viewer might initially be of the opinion that this film is generic, providing some ""i've seen this before"" passages. However, as the narrative moves along, it becomes apparent that members of the production team have constructed an above-average work, one that avoids undue emphasis upon the too often seen gruesome events and tiresome formulae.  As example, the protagonist family, the Barretts, headed by players Josh Hamilton and Keri Russell, with their two sons, ages 13 and six, have not recently moved to an isolated home, as is so often the case.  Instead, the action takes place amid a suburban tract setting, with the Barretts financially struggling with a U. S. faltering economy.  As a consequence,  the film offers development of dramatic significance in lieu of expected sensationalism.  Serving to strengthen this emphasis, usage of special effects is eschewed in favour of homely family centered incident.  This is a science fiction, not horror themed, film having a motif of alien abduction.  Its  production characteristics are of consistently high quality,  and appropriate to the scenario, with Russell and J.K. Simmons (as a conspiracy theorist) bagging the acting honours.  Definitely recommended, particularly for viewers who prefer their thrills mottled with some style.  The film is available within an Anchor Bay DVD package that includes some interesting ""special features"", including alternate and deleted scenes, in addition to an engaging commentary featuring writer/director Scott Stewart accompanied by other production team members.

I wouldn't be spoiling anything by telling you that the alien species in the movie is the ""greys"". The movie tries very hard to stick to common theories and beliefs that come from eye witnesses in our real world in an attempt to make the movie more frightening with its ""authenticity"". That is the problem though, it isn't really all that scary and some scenes are quite laughable. There are maybe one or two moments that may surprise you. It is disappointing to see the director of Insidious make this average thriller. The story is decent and it centers around a family trying to stand up against aliens that continuously harass them with visitations. It is original and entertaining enough to keep things interesting. Unfortunately that is all the movie has to offer, an ok story with few scares.

5588190,3,B00BEIYG98,"The Barret family is your typical suburban clan - mother, father, two sons - living in a nice house, in a lovely, white-picket-fence neighborhood.  Yet, as we're repeatedly told with labored visual metaphors, all is not what it seems - there are cracks in the foundation.  Daniel (Josh Hamilton) is an architect, but not a particularly successful one:  he was laid off recently and is having a hard time finding a new job.  Lacy (Keri Russell) is a realtor and the sole bread-winner; thanks to the economic downturn, though, her paychecks are few and far between, evidenced by the past-due mortgage notices.  The oldest boy, Jesse (Dakota Goyo), is struggling through typical teenage issues but, thanks to the strained atmosphere in the house and in the relationship between his parents, he's acting out through poor choices in friends and drug experimentation.  But it's Sam (Kadan Rockett), the youngest boy, who's experiencing the most difficulty, suffering through terrifying dreams, sleepwalking, and visitations from someone he calls the Sandman.  Soon events escalate, affecting the rest of the family, as unseen intruders begin invading the house, at first doing innocuous things like arranging strange geometric displays out of canned food and furniture and stealing every photo.  Then the house is attacked by three separate swarms of birds at once, strange marks appear on the kids' bodies, Daniel deals with a persistent and irritating rash behind his ear, while Lacy loses time and even control of her body.  After Lacy does some investigating, she comes to a startling conclusion as to the cause of their problems, and it's not ghosts.  After persuading Daniel, with some effort, they meet with an alien abduction expert, played by J.K. Simmons, who gives them enlightening yet ultimately depressing news about their fate.  He also tells them to fight, to do all they can to stay together as a family, advice which leads to the big showdown of the movie and a ...? ending.

As much as I wanted to really be scared by this movie, I instead found myself slightly bored and occasionally frustrated by it.  A lot of my frustration came from the insistence on whoever's part to keep the film dark.  Not dark as in psychologically dark, but as in physically dark, as in ""why doesn't anyone turn on a light around here?"" dark.  In fact, when it came to the big 'jump' moment in the movie (a scene that was used in some of the trailers), the scene was so poorly lit that I couldn't see what Lacy was reacting to in her son's room (even though I already knew what it was, thanks to those trailers).  I ended up adjusting my TV set, even though its settings were perfect for every other movie I've watched, so that I could watch the rest of Dark Skies and actually see what was going on.

In the end, I just wasn't scared by this movie, thanks in large part to that trailer spoiling the big scary moment of the movie.  But even though there were a couple more points in the movie where I was supposed to be scared, I just wasn't.  And I think this is because I realized I'd seen it all before in other movies such as Fire in the Sky or Signs.  Dark Skies isn't a bad movie, per se.  Yes, there are some plot holes and logic fails, but not enough to completely derail the thing.  And I will give kudos to the movie for relying on a more psychological approach to the scares rather than the typical slasher/blood 'n gore approach.  Heck, if you want, grab a bunch of friends, pop some popcorn, turn out the lights, and sit down to watch this.  I can guarantee that you'll at least be mildly entertained.  If you're looking to be so scared you jump at every spooky-looking shadow, though, this isn't the movie to do that.",1369958400,,3722,4.663093415007657

Once you get past the drawn out intro this movie becomes pretty thrilling. It's never really scary but it has some creepy scenes and some shocking moments. A handful of which you won't forget right away and will probably talk or think about the next day.

I was interested in the movie and it had a fairly engaging story line going but it was honestly way too short. I could have watched another half hour to forty five minutes at least to get a more well rounded story. Regardless, the acting is great and the effects are really good and all around it's a pretty enjoyable flick. It's refreshing to have a horror movie be entertaining and maintain the PG-13 rating.

Then again, I didn't understand the critics dislike of ""The Forth Kind"" from a few years ago or the dislike of ""Fire In The Sky"" from many years ago. I seems like whenever a movie comes along that doesn't involve a bike riding alien going over the moon (E.T.) or monsters blowing up the planet (Independence Day)the critics just can't seem to wrap their heads around it. I've read about this movie being compared to the Paranormal Activity series. This had NOTHING to do with ghosts. The usage of camcorders is minimal and I wouldn't for a second consider this film part of the ""shaky cam"" genre. I knew within the first ten minutes this film was about alien abductions. You're either a fan of this sort of film or you're not. As far as your belief in aliens or inter-dimensional beings....I'm agnostic....like religion. The movie itself? Brilliant acting. Amazing direction. Perfectly cast. Excellent score. Many genuine moments that made me recoil in shock....not in a gross out way but in fright. One of the best entries in the alien abduction genre I've ever seen. Do you remember those few REALLY freaky episodes of the X Files?

5588194,4,B00BEIYG98,"Disguised as yet another generic abduction thriller, ""Dark Skies"" feels surprisingly original and works as a engrossing blend of science fiction and horror, a sort of hybrid of ""Alien"" and ""Poltergeist"" and ""Paranormal Activity.""  If you're willing to look past some clunky dialogue, unrealistic character behavior, and a few moments that feel a bit over the top, you still have ninety-five minutes of thrills, shocks, and disturbing sequences that leave you uneasy and contemplative as the credits roll.  I went in with very low expectations, and as a result, I was impressed.  My spouse was thoroughly freaked out, exclaiming half-way through that the film was ""good and chilling.""  We both agreed that the music - or at least, the atmospheric noise - was very effective.  We were ill at ease, which I'm sure was the point, and despite joking that the wardrobe budget was apparently so small that star Keri Russell had to go half the film without shoes or a bra, we felt that ""Dark Skies"" was well cast, particularly the two young siblings at the center of the story.

Of course, there are problems with ""Dark Skies.""  I thought that some of the character behavior was ridiculous.  Up against late mortgage payments and an unemployed husband, real estate agent Russell gives up a much-needed potential sale after bonding with a mother for about twenty seconds, telling her that her family could ""do better"" with another house.  Later, following the classic horror formula, the family separates at a crucial moment when there would obviously have been more safety in numbers.  Dad Josh Hamilton can't quite decide how he feels about his family's situation, while battling powerful forces with kitchen knives and firearms.  But in the end, none of that matters because the film, as a whole, is a nail-biting, suspenseful journey with a sad inevitability.  And while the bleak ending is not exactly a major plot twist, it's shocking enough that it gives you one last chill.  It's worth noting that the DVD includes some 15 minutes worth of deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is just as sad as the original but somehow even more disturbing.  I'm not sure what the re-watchability is for ""Dark Skies,"" but it's definitely worth a rental on a dark, rainy night.",1369958400,,2267,4.931578947368421
5588195,4,B00BEIYG98,"If you've seen the trailer for this movie then you probably know what the main theme involved is. If not then by all means wait until you've seen it before reading further. Yes, this is a spoiler alert for those who have no clue what this movie is about.

Years ago it seemed that we lived in paranoid fear of what beings from another planet might intend for those of us here. Movies had a common theme of us versus them and a battle always followed. Then Steven Spielberg brought us both E.T. and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and suddenly aliens were a friendly bunch who just wanted to hang out. That gets tossed aside and the old times return with the movie DARK SKIES.

The Barrett family seems like your typical suburban group. Mother Lacy (Keri Russell) is a real estate agent, father Daniel (Josh Hamilton) is a recently unemployed architect, older son Jesse (Dakota Goyo) is the typical troubled teen going through adolescence and youngster Sam (Kadan Rockett) is pretty much oblivious to it all just thinking about playing. Their life seems idyllic at first but then we get glimpses of troubled times like a 90 day notice on their mortgage.

It seems that Daniel has been unemployed longer than we suspected and finding a job isn't going as well as he had hoped. Lacy is also having problems not being able to sell some of the properties she's been in charge of. To cap it off Jesse's rebellious side is beginning to show itself in the tone he uses now and then.

As if this wasn't enough, strange things begin to happen around the house. First off Lacy goes downstairs one night to find her refrigerator emptied all over the kitchen floor yet she's just seen everyone asleep in their beds. The next night she wakes and goes down to find all the food in the cupboards stacked in geometrical patterns like a jigsaw puzzle on the tables, chairs and counters. The police find no evidence of break in and suspect someone in the house is doing this.

Daniel has their house security system re-started and the results offer nothing more than the alarm going off with these same sorts of situations found in the house. When the parents question the boys, of course they know nothing of what's going on. But Sam does tell his mother about someone who told him not to tell, who was behind all this. He tells her it was the Sandman.

At first afraid that the stress of their home life may be doing something to their children, they attempt to gather more information. Daniel sets up a camera system connected to the computer to watch the halls and rooms. What he finds is glitches that travel from room to room but show nothing. Things get stranger still when Sam flips out at the playground and can't remember a thing. Then Lacy finds she can't account for 6 hours of her day yet has a bruise on her forehead.

Things change and the story alters, from what could have been a ghost story to science fiction, when Lacy enters Sam's room one night and in the darkness sees a shape standing over the bed. Lights turned on and he disappears but Sam is suddenly outside looking towards the sky. With no understanding of what is happening and fears that no one can calm, the couple eventually turn to a source they're not sure of, a man who studies these sorts of things. But is this contact enough for them to change things around?

The movie offers a number of jump scenes and quick glimpses into what might be going on without revealing it for certain until Lacy's glimpse. It is then that as viewers we know what's going on for sure but the characters still aren't quite convinced. The suspense factor in the film is held up throughout and it's not until half way through that you begin to have thoughts of what might be. Of course the trailer, as I said earlier, did give you enough information that you tend to veer off the haunted track and more towards...well you'll see.

The production values of the film are top notch. Everything from every single performance to the photography are melded together to make a suspenseful film that will hold your interest from start to finish. Best of all the movie doesn't go for the cheap and easy route of extreme gore (with a few minor scenes) or over the top effects. Instead it relies on storytelling and involving characters to get you involved. Once again a film shows restraint and offers complete entertainment showing that it can be done.",1369958400,,4392,4.542351453855878
5588196,3,B00BEIYG98,"Anyone expecting a supernatural horror flick with buckets of blood and gore should look elsewhere.  What we have here is a somewhat interesting take on the problems of an American family hyper-impacted by outside forces.  If you've seen ""Paranormal Activity"" or any of the sequels or countless other ghost stories brought to the screen you have the basic premise here.

The difference is that the intruders are not spirits, goblins or specters but aliens from another world.  And I have to say, I'm more likely to buy into aliens than ghosts, but hey that's just me.  Unlike the countless alien invasions we're used to, with big budgets, a big cast and big loud bangs, ""Dark Skies"" has the kind that are quiet and look like an anorexic E. T.

Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton (not the baseball player) play Lacy and Daniel Barrett.  They have 2 sons, teenage Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan Rockett) who seem pretty normal.  Daniel is out of work architect and the bills are piling up.  Lacy is a real estate agent but she's struggling for a sale.  They wake up one day to find their kitchen in disarray, another day all the pictures are gone from their frames.  Naturally they suspect vandals but the police don't buy it and blame the kids.

Eventually each member of the family has their own more serious experiences.  Sleepwalking, rashes, nose bleeds, black outs, etc.  Director and writer Scott Stewart does a decent job walking the line between a thriller and a family drama.  While there are some chilling moments, this is pretty tame stuff.",1369958400,,1549,4.749063670411985

If you must see this movie, wait until it hits Prime.",1369958400,,419,4.32051282051282
5588217,4,B00BEIYG98,"This is a science fiction movie because it has E.T.'s. But, really, it's not as much about the aliens as about how a family is caught in a nightmare. What if your six year-old has bruises all over his chest and stomach? Will social services believe they're from an alien poking him in painful experiments? Heck, will your neighbor believe it, the one who turned you in as a child abuser?

If you're a realtor and during the middle of a walk-through you zombie out and start slamming your head against a patio door, is your boss going to believe that you've been given a controlling implant by a gray?

I don't think so.
The horror for the Barrett family starts gradually. Lacy finds food missing from the fridge, and her husband, Daniel, and sons deny it was them. But the kitchen door was unlocked, so, just in case, they turn on the burglar alarm the next night and double-check the door. When the burglar alarm goes off, Daniel rushes down to the kitchen, only to find no one there, the door opened again, and dishes stacked in the middle of the kitchen floor. Not just stacked, but made into precarious towers, that, really, shouldn't be able to stay up. How could this be done in such a short time?

The nightmare escalates. Are the Barrett's doomed to be guinea pigs for the aliens. Will they ever be free. If social services lets them stay together, will the aliens?

A pretty good movie, if you watch with no mistaken expectations about it being sci-fi action or gruesome horror. ""Dark Skies"" is not action-packed but it sure made my stomach queasy.

The DVD has two bonus features:
1. Commentary. Watch the movie with commentary by Scott Stewart (writer & director), Jason Blum (producer), Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (executive producer) and Peer Gvozda (editor). This commentary was not as flashy or funny as some I've listened to, but it was great as far as letting you know why the director shot this or that scene in a certain way or what they were working towards in how they framed a scene. This includes the ending, as they had an alternate, and they needed to decide how much hope to give at the end.
I hadn't noticed, but one of the things they talk about is how different characters have different color tones, and you can guess who is going to be abducted by paying attention to that. I didn't catch it, and was fooled.
I wondered if one of the reasons the movie didn't do well at the box office is that it is hard to characterize, and a commentator mentions this: ""The movie is a bit of a tweener, in the sense that it's a sort of suburban drama/thriller/domestic drama - in the end a kind of science fiction scary movie.... as opposed to supernatural.""
2. Alternate & Deleted Scenes, which you can watch by themselves, or with commentary by Scott Stewart and Peter Gvozda. There are nine scenes. One, in particular, I think the movie was better off without. It occurs after 6 year-old Sam has the bruises on his torso. Daniel walks outside at dusk to see the families out playing with sparklers on the street. No body will talk to him, all he receives are wary judgmental stares. Though this certainly illustrates the alienation of the Barrett's, it made me angry instead of scared. So it cut into the mood of fear that the movie was building.

There's no relation between this movie and the single-season sci-fi TV series of the same name (aired 1996-97 season).

5588221,2,B00BEIYG98,"Okay first of all, the movie is okay, not great, not unwatchable... but, the problem with this movie and all movies from this production group, Jason Blum, the Insidious/Paranormal Activity sequel crew... is they rush them out a few a year, so it's not that effective or developed, but with plenty of loose ends from a sloppy script.

Okay so Dark Skies is kind of like Paranormal Activity with aliens instead of ghosts, it's not bad but it's a bit thin, they make these things so fast is why, pumping one movie out after the other, and definitely quality wanes from lack of attention and care, it could be a lot worse though...

This is what I've come to expect from this production team... potential, but little execution.

Thia is Paranormal Activity meets Sinister meets Signs meets Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind meets Poltergeist meets The Birds.

Instead of making 10 mediocre films a year, make 1 fantastic film.

Why use the implant angle and then do so little with it?  Especially when it counted.

Just like in Insidious... the attic was so under-used and the creativity was so lacking...",1369785600,2,1101,4.732984293193717
5588222,3,B00BEIYG98,"After seeing Kerri Russell in The Americans for the first few months of the year, I was curious about Dark Skies when I saw that she was in it.  I decided it give it a try because I enjoy paranormal movies too.  The Barrett family is at the center of the story, and the mother (Russell), father, and their two sons experience an escalating series of strange things that seem to be tied to their family.  This movie is full of tension, and I thought it was a great choice to watch on a stormy evening.  The plot escalates to a fevered pitch at the climax, but the ending left me wanting.  It was a really good movie for 96 of the 97 minutes, but it was as if they ran out of money and didn't have enough budget to film the proper ending.  Perhaps I missed something, but I didn't think Dark Skies delivered in terms of wrapping up the plot.  It might be worth giving a try, but there are probably better choices.

5588225,4,B00BEIYG98,"After effectively spooking us with INSIDIOUS, writer/director Scott Stewart turns on the chills with DARK SKIES.
We meet a couple in financial upheaval.  Daniel (Josh Hamilton) has recently been laid off from his job; wife Lacey (Keri Russell) is a dangerously honest real estate broker whose sales are dwindling.  They have two sons:  13 year old Sam (Dakota Goya) is entering the porno/dope enticements and 6 year old Jessie (Kadan Rockett), a precocious lad with an active imagination.  A series of weird occurrences plunges this family into a nightmare which ultimately leads them to question their sanity.
Fans of THE X-FILES and POLTERGEIST should enjoy this tidy little thriller.  The first half is a little slow but its second half picks up steam and has some tense, frightening segments.  Russell and Hamilton are quite good as the fragile but determined parents.  Goya and Rockett do well as the sons and the ubiquitous J.K. Simmons has a nice brief appearance as a tragic soul who tells the couple what's transpiring.
The whole scenario of outside unknown forces deconstructing a family's existence is inherently chilling and DARK SKIES effectively brings this point home.",1369785600,,1183,5.162303664921466

I had to deduct one point for originality. There are scenes that will remind you of other alien movies. For the uninitiated, this will play well...but for those of us all too familiar with the past works, we will ask why new twists were not employed.

Make no mistake, you will jump! It has its moments and is definitely worth the rental price if you want a good scare. Alien movies are always freaky to me, and one of my recurring nightmare themes deals with alien invasion of Earth. I can identify with a lot of this movie because of my own personal experiences since childhood.

If you believe, even slightly, that beings from other planets or dimensions visit our realm, then this movie will raise the hairs on your neck and give you goose-pimples all about. If you have children, even more so.

Enjoy with a bowl of hot buttered popcorn and a refreshing beverage, oh, and keep some veggies close at hand...they like veggies......

I want to get this straight before I get into this movie; I'm not some whack job. I just have a passion for movies and the relativity to books and facts. I am also VERY picky about my movies.

When it comes to this movie, it reminds me of a book I once read; Nothing in This Book is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are. It IS a book from a true believer of aliens (even mentioned as the ""greys"" in it), but what I find interesting is the feather touch this movie has on Sacred Geometry. Sacred Geometry can not be disproved yet by advanced mathematicians and scientists. I am not saying that aliens are real; I am saying the Sacred Geometry is. And I appreciate that this movie touches on it if it was even for a correlation of maybe a minute.

This movie brings that book I mentioned into a beautiful display of suspense, action, graphics, art, and mind blowing mental benders. Signs is nothing in comparison to this movie in the terms of alien movies. You need to watch this NOW if you want to sit on the edge of your seat until the very, VERY last second.

5588378,3,B00BEIYG98,"This review may contain spoilers.

I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of Dark Skies to review.  Here are my thoughts:

Dark Skies is a Horror/Thriller involving the subject of alien invasion/abductions and stars Josh Hamilton who plays the role of Daniel and Keri Russell who plays, Lacy, Daniel's wife.  Naturally, given the state of the economy, Daniel is looking for a job and Lacy is a struggling real estate agent.  Daniel and Lucy have two kids, Sam and Jesse, and they seem to be an average American family; however, someone within this seemingly normal family has been chosen by the aliens to be taken away with them.

Lacy and Daniel start to experience some strange happenings at their house and Sam, their youngest son, says that the Sandman has been doing these things.  They eventually activate their home alarm as they think someone has been entering their home.  That night, the home alarm trips and the monitoring company states that it must be a false alarm because all the sensors were tripped instead of just one.

Sam keeps having dreams about the Sandman and he starts acting weird.  More strange things happen at the house and, Lacy, who has been awakened almost every night since the strange events, thinks she sees someone in Sam's room who wasn't her son.  So, eventually, Lacy and Daniel decide to set up cameras throughout the house in hope of finding something.  Naturally, like it happens in every Horror film, the cameras malfunction giving them the impression that something is going on.

Meanwhile, Lacy starts having weird experiences herself.  She does some research and finds a website with some signs that she's seen in her house and figures out that the signs mean that someone has been chosen.  Lacy eventually tells Daniel about what she's found in her research, but Daniel doesn't want to believe her.  He is in denial and thinks something else is causing the strange events.  Daniel starts to believe after he finds some anomalies within the video he's caught with his cameras.

Daniel and Lacy finally go see an expert on aliens and alien abductions and he starts to ask them questions.  It appears that most of the questions pertain to Daniel and Lacy.  The expert claims that aliens have already invaded Earth sometime in the past and their presence is just a fact of life.  He also states that both Daniel and Lacy probably already have implants in their bodies as well.  The expert states when the aliens are ready to show themselves, that's when they take someone; however, he does give Daniel and Lacy advice on how to get rid of them.

The ending of Dark Skies, for me at least, was a little bit anti-climactic.  It wasn't anything that really moved me and seemed a bit predictable after watching the events that unfolded within previous scenes of the movie.  There is an alternate ending on this Blu-ray that, I believe, is maybe a bit better than the one that made the final cut, but both are still just endings and really nothing great or grand.

Overall, I was a bit disappointed in Dark Skies.  I went into this movie hoping for something a bit scarier that would stick with me for a while, but I was let down.  The story is a good story and subject, but I think it could have been portrayed better in the movie than what it was.  Overall, I give this movie a 3/5 star rating.

5588379,3,B00BEIYG98,"The Barrett family - father Daniel (Josh Hamilton), mother Lacy (Keri Russell), oldest son Jesse (Dakota Goyo), and youngest son Sammy (Kadan Rockett)are unaware that their peaceful suburban life is about to be rocked by an escalating series of disturbing events, as they come to learn that a terrifying and deadly force is after them.

In the beginning, the Barrett family seem like a normal family, father Daniel had been laid-off and is looking for a job while the bills continue to pile up causing stress between Daniel and Lacy.

Soon, strange events begin to occur, Lacy wakes up at night and discovers the fridge door open with its contents spread out and the backdoor wide open. Another night, Lacy wakes up and heads down to the kitchen. She discovers all of their canned and packaged foods stacked up in towers all over the kitchen counters, floor, and all over the floor. The alarm goes off one night but all the doors and windows are locked, birds fly into the house.

Lacy has a viewing at a house for sale. She's talking to the couple at the viewing when she becomes unable to speak and enters a trance. She walks towards the glass door and begins to bash her head repeatedly against it before waking up in her own bed. She finds a bruise forming on her forehead and notices that she blacked out for 6 hours.

Lacy begins to do research online and finds articles on UFOs along with pictures other children have drawn that are very similar to the one that Sammy has drawn of a child and three grey figures holding hands beside a house.

Lacy and Daniel visit a specialist, Edwin Pollard (J. K. Simmons), who calls the beings ""The Grays"". Pollard informs them that many have suffered the same fate as the Barretts, with most cases ending in a child abduction.  Edwin warns the Barretts that they should be hyper-protective of their child, who has been ""chosen"" and that they must work together in order to save their son in hopes the aliens will move on to another family.

Dark Skies does a great job of building suspense and you find yourself as puzzled as the Barretts and trying to figure out what is going on and why. It doesn't really explain why and the suspense builds and just when you think that you have figured out, it goes in a different direction.

5588385,4,B00BEIYG98,"When first viewing the trailer for ""Dark Skies,"" I was immediately excited to see it. It appeared to be another supernatural horror film concerning a creepy little kid. You can never go wrong using that concept. My interest waned a bit upon learning the movie revolved around an alien encounter. I don't dislike movies about aliens, but they just don't excite me as much as a good ghost story or haunted house flick.

I still held on to hope as I put ""Dark Skies"" in my Blu-ray player and settled in to watch it. I can happily report that my hopes weren't dashed. The commercials and trailers for the film captured its essence perfectly.

Daniel (Josh Hamilton) and Lacey Barret (Keri Russell) and their two children are just like any ordinary family struggling to make ends meet and pay the mortgage on their suburban two-story house. That is until a seemingly invisible visitor begins invading their home. Things get more serious when the sinister activities begin to focus on their youngest son (Kadan Rockett).

Director Scott Stewart knew exactly what to do to make ""Dark Skies"" work. He took typical alien abduction films like ""Fire in the Sky"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and injected them with all the positive aspects of newer horror films like ""Insidious,"" ""Paranormal Activity,"" and ""Sinister."" He tossed in some classic supernatural flavor via ""Poltergeist"" for good measure. The recipe works to the extent that I actually jumped at one point so hard I moved the area rug out from underneath me in my living room.

The entire cast of ""Dark Skies"" fully embraces their roles. Each one gives you something emotional to grab on to. This awards the viewer attachments to each of them that carry you through the movie and invest in the journeys they take as characters.

""Dark Skies"" looks and sounds great thanks to a favorable high definition transfer. The picture is clean and the darkness of the color palette guarantees a creepy mood and great jump scares. There are tons of little sounds and special effects to take in through the 5.1 surround mix.

Special features included on the Blu-ray version of ""Dark Skies"" are the usual. There are alternate and deleted scenes which contain a different ending. Audio commentary is provided by Writer / Director Scott Stewart, Producer Jason Blum, Executive Producer Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, and Editor Peter Gvozdas.

""Dark Skies"" will appeal to both horror and sci-fi fans looking for some new thrills and chills. I give props to Director / Writer Scott Stewart for finding a successful way to marry together alien abduction films with the new style of supernatural horror films coming out these days. It's much more exciting than having to sit through another ""Paranormal Activity"" film.",1369353600,,2755,4.9373650107991365
5588485,5,B00BEIYG98,"Dark Skies breaks no new ground, is ridden with cliches, and rips off just about every other genre film that came before it. So why does it deserve the 5 stars nobody wants to give it? Because it works. And by ""works,"" I mean it's SCARY. Dark Skies mixes the tension building of Signs with the family corrosion of Insidious; demonic possession being swapped out for alien infestation. It also has some great B movie elements and an open ending that makes it a fun movie to watch drunk, high, or with your relatives if your are into that sort of thing.

The first act is pretty slow and dumb. Bizarre wildlife behavior and screaming kids with vacant expressions doesn't do the rest of the movie justice. The couple that serves as the focal point of this story are so naive it's hilarious. Especially the husband, who is jobless and wears a permanent neckbeard. He goes from interview to interview, gets turned down everywhere for being such a candy ass, and ends up taking his frustration out on the neighborhood children in one very funny scene. The arrival of evil aliens is what keeps this family from falling apart.

Once the alien invaders show up halfway through, the movie takes off. The husband and wife team up to hunt down their ""Father Merrin,"" who turns out to be a horribly miscasted J.K. Simmons (Schillinger in HBO's Oz). The director could have chosen just about anyone to play alien conspiracy expert Edwin Pollard, but he chooses the one guy who could not have done a worse job. Lucky for the audience, Simmons acts as a consultant instead of fighting the aliens head-on, and gets minimal screen time.

The film has plenty of very creepy moments for a movie of its kind. It blends in elements borrowed from many recent horror movies instead of sci-fi, and does not take itself too seriously during breaks in the main plot events. The soundtrack is bass heavy, and features a rhythmic beat that is in perfect sync with the sheepish husband's heart. The husband becomes more unstable as the tension rises and the audience is quick to know it through the eerie score.",1369267200,6,2081,4.649456521739131
5588486,4,B00BEIYG98,"I don't talk about this much, but I've always been fascinated with alien-abduction movies.  I've already confessed many times that I LOVE the ALIEN franchise, but that's different...those creatures are not abductors, they're just mean, ferocious, unstoppable killing machines.  The alien-abduction movies I'm referring to now are those that usually deal with Grays, the name given to the abductors from those who have supposedly been taken.  When I saw Anchor Bay was handling DARK SKIES, I knew it was going to be a must-see for me.  And although the film reiterates many existing tropes of abduction movies, this is still a must-watch film.  DARK SKIES is a top-notch horror flick that will make you squirm.

I think the primary allure of alien-abduction movies for me is that the victim(s) is usually so powerless that no matter what they do, the ending is always the same:  someone is taken.  I'm not sure why this strikes such a primal nerve for me, but I always get chills when watching these kinds of movies.  I guess that's why I find them so effective in regard to entertainment value.

DARK SKIES is extremely successful in the thrills and chills department.  The film is shot very well and many of the camera shots emphasize, if not enhance, these scares.  I caught myself jumping at various points throughout the film, so many times that I actually laughed at myself for getting so worked up.  The acting is also great and the production value is very high.  Overall, this movie looks excellent on-screen.

The special effects, although few and far between here, are good, and I am particularly impressed with how the production team decided to tackle the appearance of the Grays.  Instead of soulless blobs of color or over-detailed, humanistic beings, the effects team decided to make them vague, but with just enough detail to scare the crap out of the audience.  You truly have to see them to catch what I mean.  But I tip my hat to that decision, as it makes the feel of the movie even creepier.

My sole complaint about DARK SKIES is that we've seen pretty much everything the movie has to offer before, in previous films.  Now, don't get me wrong:  I am NOT trying to dissuade you from seeing this film.  On the contrary, I highly suggest you check it out.  It is made well and should entertain even the most diehard of horror fans on some level.  But...do not go into this one expecting something new.  You will probably be disappointed if you do.

DARK SKIES is a definitive win for me and I recommend giving it a look.  There are plenty of chilling scenes in this film to sink your teeth into, and the ending has a slight twist that should leave you feeling cold.  Be sure and check out the alternate ending as well in the Bonus Features; I actually prefer the existing one, but the alternate was pretty cool, too.  This film hits store shelves next week, so make a note.",1369267200,,2893,4.650887573964497
5588487,1,B00BEIYG98,"Rent or buy this film if you want to sit in disbelief over how much this sophomoric script is derivative of M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS, written with a (recent?) film school graduate's slavish attention to the source material. Yes, the film is incredibly slow-paced and episodic; and yes, the film's two main protagonist's are, for the most part, passive.  But you might have some real fun competing with a friend in calling out the SIGNS rip-offs.  Allow me to give you a head start on your checklist:
1. A handheld walkie-talkie (instead of the baby monitor in SIGNS)
2. Boarding up the windows.
3. A barking dog.
4. A kid with asthma
5. Almost identical shape of ""baddie""
6. Father going through work/identity crisis
7. Child drawings. Loads of child drawings. (like this device wasn't stale even five years ago)
8. The Third Act ""hunkering down"" scene, where, as a counterpoint to the ""tension,"" parent shares quaint anecdotes of each child's pasts
9. Menace threatens in the form of a white light bleeding through slats in boarded up windows (accompanied by the obligatory banging and thudding)
10. Flocks of birds slamming into the house. (okay, this one is strictly Du Maurier and Hitchcock, and, okay, even Stephen King [The Dark Half] if you want to go that way, so I guess we have to give the writer props for--what? Diversity?)

5588488,2,B00BEIYG98,"Home invasion meets aliens in this formulaic made-for-TV quality flick that reveals practically every single plot point in the trailer. There are elements of Paranormal Activity, Signs and Poltergeist and you know the family is pretty much doomed from the first thirty minutes. When the aliens finally arrive, they're the tall 1940s generic type that show how little thought the filmmakers put into the idea.

Keri Russell is good as always and while there are a few jumps, it's hardly a horror by any stretch. There are annoyingly bad expository scenes thrown in along the way though J K Simmons was a good casting call as the character who has to explain what's going on to the victim family. It's pretty typical of this genre in that the characters don't develop, they just respond (usually with flawed logic) to the bad things that happen to them. It's lazy, passable entertainment but not a film I'd watch twice -- although once I'd seen the trailer, I had effectively watched it twice.",1369008000,3,991,4.829411764705882

Then it came to the second run cheap theaters and with some encouragement from my son, we went. How refreshing to see a horror film that doesn't throw a bunch cheap scares at you every 5 minutes. There is some genuine HORROR in this movie. Don't expect a big payoff at the end, but the ride is fun while it lasts and there are some genuinly creepy moments scattered throughout. As with any horror movie, there are some actions that the main characters take that will frustrate you, but it's nice to see an alien abduction movie for a change (how many more movies about possessed teen girls or haunted houses do we need?). One thing that would have made this movie a lot creepier is if the family home was situated in a more rural area (ala Communion and Close Encounters). I've always found horror situations less frightening when there are neighbors 50 feet away. I enjoyed this one more than Sinister or Insidious (both produced by this studio).

They wonder if what is causing the problems is ghostly or other worldly. This is another movie that I didn't watch any previews for before watching so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie started off a little slow and seemed like it was trying really hard to be Paranormal Activity, then halfway through a twist happened and started to really spin out of control to almost the absurd. The movie started off a little slow but interesting and I will say that it did speed up a little but at the expense of the story. It wasn't really believable to start with but as it went on it got more and more out there. Overall, its not a bad movie but just a little to unbelievable for me to really get into.

5588528,4,B00BEIYG98,"I'm not one for rave reviews. I find most films trite, redundant, regurgitated, shallow and self righteous. I can hardly sit through most horrors, because it all seems rushed, boring, and pedestrian, so why wouldn't this. I gave it a go. Standards of other films set in immediately and fast, and though it touches on elements so many other films have in so many ways: of Spielberg genius as Poltergeist and Close Encounters come to mind, (which no doubt people will claim metaphors to endlessly), but the film holds its own in a very simple, straight forward non CGI nonsense way, and its kind of brilliant because truly the ensemble cast does so well together, its believable how terrified they are. I believe the reason why Poltergeist was such a novelty, was not only the absolute terror of a film that stands the test of time, but there was real substance to it (the conversations that Beatrice Straight had with Jobeth Williams' character, how touching and special it was, and with the mothers son, how soothing she was, in a time of absolute pinnacle terror) That is achieved here. Yeah it's no Poltergeist, but in a market saturated with hundreds of turds released a year, this one comes out truly shining. It was very well done.

I am not good with what I want to say when detailing, but the colors are great, the story holds its own on minimal special effects, and considering its from the same people that bring us the ridiculous Paranormal Activity franchise, (loathed Insidious) I absolutely loved this.",1366675200,22,1515,4.760456273764259
5588529,2,B00BEIYG98,"The music acts as a jump cue and heightens the 'scare' moments at every opportunity. Do not expect blood and guts from this film, as the goriest moment is when a flock of birds miscalculate their landing. Thankfully the appearance of the 'aliens' is limited and only shadows and outlines are revealed. This may be due to the restricted use of special effects, as it appears the money went into a decent cast.

Dark Skies offers nothing new to the horror scene, instead it regurgitates the standard premise for any home invasion movie. This sci-fi horror plot had great potential; however it sticks too close to a safe, familiar storyline and finishes with a non-existent twist. Dark Skies is a well made and acted film but it doesn't feature any new ideas. A low budget movie that reigns in the special effects and lets the cast guide the fear, as the safety of the white picket fence is breached again...(yawn)

5588530,4,B00BEIYG98,"The story opens showing us a stereotypical suburban neighborhood. The focus shifts to one family. Daniel (Josh Hamilton) is out of work. He can't pay the mortgage but has money for all kinds of video equipment. His wife Lacy (Keri Russell) is a real estate salesperson, and perhaps too honest for her own good. They have two sons, Jesse (Dakota Goyo) who is discovering girls and pot and young Sammy (Kadan Rockett).

The story builds slow, creating character as it goes along, with each incident becoming more puzzling and troubling. Sammy reports of seeing the Sandman, claiming he is responsible for the odd occurrences. About an hour into the film, the events are explained in case you didn't figure it out by the opening Arthur C. Clarke quote.

This film is well done. I enjoyed it, even though I still say the whole thing business is hypnagogic hallucinations. This is must see for those who believe in the Grays. I would rate it somewhere in between rent to own depending on your hypnagogia. (Guess what word I learned this week from my doctor?)

5588531,3,B00BEIYG98,"What's the most frightening thing in the world? Spiders? Snakes? Being buried alive? Listening to Yoko Ono albums? Well, the latter choices are terrifying in their own way. But what about the feeling of constantly being watched? Pretty creepy, right? How about someone, or something, constantly watching you, but you can't see them? Now that's a whole different level of horrifying. Dark Skies presents us with a paradigm that we've seen in countless films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and especially the X-Files, but delivers it on a different scale.

  Dark Skies opens like any other horror film: A happy suburban family doing their usual routines (in this case, the father, an architect, trying to sell his work, the mother being a real estate agent), when everything, both subtly and slowly, begins to take turns for the worst. From personal belongings being put in odd places, to pictures gone missing, to full blown possession, whatever is taking hold of the family is also trying to destroy them. But why? A simple question driving an entire film forward is a tough idea, especially for a horror film, and the payoff is what ultimately makes or breaks it in the end. Fortunately, not only do the answers work to Dark Skies' advantage, but the scares are well-thought out and, well, actually scary. It's nice that a horror film uses immense amounts of tension with good end results instead of resorting to cheap jump scares, I.E., Paranormal Activity. How ironic, coming from a producer of both of these movies.

  But it isn't without flaws, obviously. There are some genuinely eerie moments in the film, but some of them end up being confusing and disappointing when the climax is finally revealed; There are plot holes and ham-fisted moments in key periods that derive a little bit from the atmosphere and enjoyment from the film, but fortunately, they're few and far inbetween, and not noticeable or large enough to ruin or devalue the film's intensity.

  As a pleasant surprise, Dark Skies retains the key points of a good horror film while introducing new ideas to a sub-genre whose tank is starting to run empty. Even if it isn't the best horror film to come along in a long time, it certainly provides a rush as well as a satisfying climax that many other films of its kind don't succeed at.",1364515200,,2318,4.818639798488665
