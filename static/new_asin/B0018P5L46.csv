8270454,5,B0018P5L46,"Been training agility dogs for almost 20 years and just decided to purchase this to see why my dogs' contact performance has never been great.  And I found it!

This is an older DVD, but still completely applicable, especially to the dog walk.",1522627200,,426,4.578947368421052
