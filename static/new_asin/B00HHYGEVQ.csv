8632951,2,B00HHYGEVQ,"The DVD  cover art of Dark Satanic Magick would have you believe that this movie takes place in some wintery forest setting with the promise of a supernatural tale. At some point the movie does get into the woods but for the first 55 minutes this soft core tale of sexual perversion takes place inside a grubby little room where our female captive is held prisoner by a male figure whose face is never shown. No names are given to either character.
Narrating her own story she recounts the sex fantasies she is subjected to, some of which she even enjoys. Other scenes show her either frolicking around her room or just masturbating. (""I slept well that night!"") Right off the bat you realize you've just paid for yet another low budget ""horror"" movie that has no real plotline. And despite her claim that her captor cut her tongue open you see no blood at all. The running time may be short but the movie is tediously slow. The only things that get you through it are A): that the actress is naked in nearly every moment save for her red cloak (which I guess represents the Satanic angle). And B): the movie's surprisingly impressive musical selections. Some classical tracks are played to scenes of our heroine dancing around her room.
Eventually, she overwhelms her captor with ""magic"" (although it looks more like she's giving him a handjob) and frees herself to run around in said forest. When the movie runs out of story (uh-huh) we are treated to an extended dance sequence from earlier. As you're about ready to hit the stop button a message pops up stating that our girl has just taken on a pupil of her own. We are then treated to a full on lesbian love scene. Wow.
 Dark? Certainly. Satanic? Hardly. Magick? Well, I guess that would depend on what your proclivities are now wouldn't it?",1403568000,5,1797,4.577639751552795
