4532715,4,B0052Y0FOA,"If you know nothing about the blues, or if you're curious to know some of the workings behind a blues record label, then this DVD is for you. It focuses on the people behind, and the performers of, the largest Blues record company in the world. Alligator Records.

This film is set up in quite a unique way. It's a small part documentary about the record label and its owner, Bruce Iglauer, and a larger part concert film highlighting the artists that Alligator records employs. The concert part is most interesting, because each performance takes place in a different setting. From Koko Taylor performing the Star Spangled Banner in old Comisky Park in Chicago, to Lonnie Brooks performing Sweet Home Chicago in one of the towns local hot spots, this is where the DVD positively shines. We have archive black and white footage, studio footage, practice takes, and band interviews. Every one of these is highlighted by great stereo sound.

One of the nice things to see in the documentary is how musicians are bringing blues music into the schools. There is a nice segment showing a classroom performing a couple songs, and it reminds us that music is indeed needed as part of the continuing curriculum in schools around the country, and the world.

At points, this DVD feels like a one hour advertisement for Alligator records, which cannot be a bad thing, because it worked. I, for one do not own any Alligator Records products, and now I plan to change that the next time I'm at my local record store, and you should as well.

It's filmed in the full screen aspect ratio and comes with a nice 8 page booklet with a write up about the film. Here is the list of performances on the DVD.

2. Horoscope
3. Sky Is Crying
4. You Don't Love Me

4532716,5,B0052Y0FOA,"Great little slice of what a small label is all about with passion driving it rather than slick dishonest profits.  Been listening to Alligator recordings since the 80's and always have prized one when I found it in a used record shop (Yes, vinyl records if you can remember them).  The quality of the recordings has always been special as well as the performances themselves.  I've always taken them for granted as more of a solid major label since the cover art was always top notch and the recordings of such a high quality.  The same goes for Delmark which was mentioned in this film.  Kind of amazing to find that these labels were more of a mom and pop store effort with budgets tight and no bling seen anywhere.  I guess they had to live the blues to help produce it.  I just listened to vol. 2 of the best of Alligator and appreciate it more than ever now.",1349222400,7,864,4.3625
4532717,5,B0052Y0FOA,"Bruce Iglauer founded the well-known blues record label Alligator Records over 40 years ago but - for some reason - it has taken 20 years for this 54 minute documentary by Jim Downing to make it to home video and DVD!.  Produced, using video, rather than film, in 1991, apparently to celebrate the label's 20th anniversary, this is different than another film titled ""Pride and Joy"" released by BMG Video in 1994.

I'm glad it is seeing the light of day as Downing does not short change the viewer with excerpts of musical performances by well-known artists. Most the performances are of complete songs. There a rare black and white performance by Alligator's first ""star"" - Hound Dog Taylor. (Iglauer, who worked for Bob Koester's Delmark label actually formed Alligator because he wanted to record Taylor and Koester didn't). Alligator's other big artist was - and still is - Koko Taylor. Instead of getting her hit ""Yang Dang Doodle"" we see her singing the ""Star Spangled Banner"" in a powerful version before a Chicago baseball game. We see Taylor again in tandem with Lonnie Brooks in another section.

All these performances are integrated into the story of how a small independent record label tries to survive  - even 20 years ago, before the Internet and iTunes changed the playing field. There are the costs of  promotional junkets and attending conferences. Iglauer is interviewed at length and we follow him into the recording studio to record his then-newly-discovered artists.

The quality of the image and sound are decent though neither hi-def nor hi-fi. But these are the blues.

Any fan of Alligator's roster will probably enjoy this DVD. There are no bonus features other than subtitles in six different languages!

It brought back great musical memories of visiting blues clubs in the windy city after attending the consumer electronics shows when they were in Chicago.  Lonnie Brooks, Koko Taylor, Hound dog Taylor, and Lucky Peterson all sound great. Thanks Alligator records for keeping the blues alive in this entertaining documentary.",1463702400,,378,5.389830508474576
4532720,4,B0052Y0FOA,"Excellent documentary on the history of Alligator Records and the early and current musicians that make up its extensive catalog.  No story on the resurgence of the blues during the 70s and 80s would be complete without a chapter dedicated to the story of Alligator Records and the dedication of Bruce Iglauer. This movie does a fine job of telling that story.

My only complaint is the lack of footage of the artists that receive mention in the movie. While I understand that the movie is about Mr. Iglauer and Alligator, I personally would have loved more focus on the artists that gave fuel to the rise of the company and the growth of the genre. Without them, there would be no story.",1463184000,,688,4.585365853658536

Alligator is a labor of love more than a money machine, and the commitment and dedication is really showcased in this film. I've been buying the 'Gator for many years and have had the opportunity to enjoy many of their artists live. Alligator captures the essence of the Chicago Blues Scene, and this film does justice to the genre, the artists, and the people who share it with the world.",1461024000,,544,4.677083333333333
