Even though I do NOT speak or read French very well (well, maybe almost at the level of a child in kindergarten, at best), having watched the first two seasons with English subtitles on Netflix,  I was able to understand the story line with the French subtitles (the only option) enabled on this disk.  Definitely worth the trouble for a hardcore 19-2 fan.",1448150400,,368,4.71875
