6853747,5,B00Q3F0GG4,"This is what I call a classic.  What I mean by that is a movie that is a bit unusual but has very good characters in it.  This movie is told as a fairy tale to a young sick boy (and those two characters right there are well known).  Your mind is captured by the story after a short while and then you will be engrossed for the rest of the time.

Several well known actors are involved and includes Billy Crystal too.  Directed by Rob Reiner.

FILM FACT No. 2: The film was shot in various locations in Great Britain and Ireland, which includes: Carl Wark, Sheffield, England. Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, England. Lathkill Dale where it meets Cales Dale (the 'Battle of wits' scene). Cave Dale, Castleton, Derbyshire, England. Bradley Rocks and Robin Hood's Stride, Birchover, Derbyshire, England. Cliffs of Moher, County Clare, Ireland (for the Cliffs of Insanity). Haddon Hall, Bakewell, Derbyshire, England. Penshurst Place, Kent, England. Popular professional wrestler Andr the Giant had undergone major back surgery prior to filming, and despite Andr the Giant great size and strength, could not support the weight of Cary Elwes during their fight scene or Robin Wright for the scene at the end of the film. For the wrestling scene, when Cary Elwes was pretending to hang on Andr the Giant's back, was actually walking on a series of ramps below the camera during close-ups. For the wide shots, a stunt double took the place of Andr the Giant. When Andr the Giant was apparently carrying  Robin Wright, she was actually suspended by cables.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE PRINCESS BRIDE film is the Golden-age throwback glows brighter than ever. Thirty years on, Rob Reiners salute to Hollywood swashbucklers remains a poignant pastiche, gloriously unencumbered by CGI visuals and gender clichs. After 30 years, the wit, fun, charm and idealism are fresher than ever. THE PRINCESS BRIDE, that was adapted by William Goldman from his novel and directed by Rob Reiner.

The film shows how it made possible fairy-tale homage and the likes of the animated films of Shrek and Frozen, and also affected the language of irony and comedy in the television pop culture that came afterwards. Its a movie that manages to be both a pastiche and a fervently real love story. THE PRINCESS BRIDE is an organically grown comedy romance from an analogue age: different from the genetically modified, digital creations that came along later.

THE PRINCESS BRIDE  is constructed as a story-within-a-story, with the framing scenes occurring in the ""real world"" as a grandfather [Peter Falk] stops by to read a story to his sick grandson [Fred Savage]. During these scenes, Rob Reiner makes a statement about the value of books over electronic forms of entertainment. When the grandfather arrives, his grandson is playing a video game, a blank expression on his face. But, once the story takes flight in his imagination, he is absorbed and transfixed and transported to another time and place in a way that even the best electronic game cannot accomplish.

The primary narrative, which evolves as the grandfather reads it and occasionally interrupts it to intersperse comments or skip over boring parts, takes place in the magical land of Florin, and tells of the true love between peasant girl Buttercup [Robin Wright] and stable hand Westley [Cary Elwes]. After declaring their unending affection for each other, they are separated, and Westley is reported dead. Buttercup, cold-hearted and stone-faced after her loss, is chosen by the crown prince, Humperdinck [Chris Sarandon] to be his bride.

Humperdinck's motives, however, are not pure. He intends to arrange for Buttercup's abduction, frame rival country Guilder for her murder, and start a war with the backing of the common folk, who love their princess-to-be. To this end, he hires three rogues to capture Buttercup: the wily Sicilian Vizzini [Wallace Shawn], who fancies himself to be the smartest man in the world and has a fondness for the word ""inconceivable;"" the giant Fezzik [Andr the Giant], who is dumb, kind-hearted, and humungous; and the swordsman Inigo Montoya [Mandy Pantankin], who is scouring the world in search of the six-fingered man who killed his beloved father.

Vizzini, Fezzik, and Inigo kidnap Buttercup one day when she's out riding. Heading for the Guilder and Florin frontier, they spirit her away by boat. Hot on their trail is the ship of the Dread Pirate. He pursues them to the Cliffs of Insanity, where he engages in a duel of steel with Inigo, a wrestling match with Fezzik, and a match of wits with Vizzini to win Buttercup. Once she is in his custody, he reveals himself to be Westley. Fleeing Humperdinck and his lackey, Count Rugen [Christopher Guest], Buttercup and Westley enter the dreaded Fire Swamp, where the ROUS (Rodents of Unusual Size) is only one of the dangers. And, once they get out, there's still Humperdinck to deal with. Fortunately, Westley and Buttercup are not without allies. Fezzik and Inigo have joined them, and there's also help from a wizened old dwarf named Miracle Max [Billy Crystal], who harbours no love for Humperdinck or Rugen.

The film is based on the book by William Goldman, who wrote his own screenplay adaptation. Before Rob Reiner came along, William Goldman had been trying for 15 years to get the fantasy film made and at one point, Norman Jewison was attached to the project. William Goldman decided that Rob Reiner was the man for the job. Years later, William Goldman would comment that he was only fully satisfied with the motion picture versions of two of his scripts: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Princess Bride.

Everyone who has seen THE PRINCESS BRIDE has their favourite scene and it's a testimony to the film's start-to-finish strength that nearly every minute of the fantasy film's running length is on someone's list. The candidates are wide and varied, ranging from the Inigo and Westley swordfight to the battle of intelligence with Vezzini to the Pit of Despair to the visit to Miracle Max's to the storming of the castle and the duel with the six-fingered man. There is little, if anything, in THE PRINCESS BRIDE that doesn't work. Director Rob Reiner hits all the right notes, and it would be impossible to achieve a better overall tone. The Billy Crystal and Carol Kane cameo offers some of THE PRINCESS BRIDE films biggest guffaws. Reportedly, Rob Reiner had to leave the set during the filming of these scenes, because Billy Crystal's ad-libs were causing him to laugh so hard he was becoming nauseated. Among the film's most appealing elements are a score by Mark Knopfler and the pleasantly intrusive presence of Peter Falk, who appears as a grandfather reading ''The Princess Bride'' to his grandson. THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a rich, all-engrossing treat. That's largely thanks to the efforts of an eclectic cast, which includes Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, Mel Smith and Peter Cook. This is a truly unexpected delight for all the family.

THE PRINCESS BRIDE MUSIC TRACK LIST

STORYBOOK LOVE [Written by Willy De Ville] [Performed by Willy De Ville]

TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME [Written by Jack Norworth] [Music by Albert Von Tilzer]

Blu-ray Image Quality  LIONSGATE Home Entertainment UK brings you this Blu-ray disc with a stunning 1080p spectacular image presentation and is helped with the equally impressive 1.85:1 [Anamorphic] aspect ratio and is equally a solid transfer. The images are sharp and the textures looks very nice and for this anniversary edition it looked very impressive. Detail can be very strong and many scenes feature a good level of depth especially where the colours are beautifully vibrant without being unnatural and the many wide shots of lush, English countryside simply pop off of the screen. Contrast is strong and black levels are deep and inky. So all in all, LIONSGATE Home Entertainment UK have done a really professional job in presenting us with something really special. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  LIONSGATE Home Entertainment UK you with a very nice 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience, which does a really great service to the film that is most of the time dialogue driven, but still has moments where the film music score and action really packs a punch. The audio balance is well handled throughout the film, with the overall sound mixing of the film gives you the feeling of a great presentation of how everything was intended to come out for the director Rob Reiner. The part of the sound is mainly experienced with the front speakers, but the rear speaker activity is a little subdued, with only some minor ambient effects and music cues. Elsewhere in the film, wind swirls about, enveloping the listener and practically placing a chill in the room. Bass rumbles here and there, especially with the ""fire swamp"" sequence is a fine example of the generally subtle yet highly effective lows that come into play several times throughout the film. The composed film score music plays clearly and accurately across the front, and dialogue is delivered crisply and accurately through the centre channel. So all in all THE PRINCESS BRIDE has never sounded better via your Home Cinema set up.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Director Rob Reiner: Here the director Rob Reiner introduces himself and welcomes us to this audio commentary on his film THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Rob informs us that Mark Knopfler would only compose the music if Robs hat from the film Spinal Tap is viewed somewhere in the film, which Rob asks us to keep a look out for it. Rob informs us that he read The Princess Bride book when he was about 25 years old and has been a massive fan of it ever since. Rob was also very proud to have secured Robin Wright-Penn for the role of Buttercup and despite being born in America, was able to do a perfect English accent. Rob also feels that the actor Cary Elwes was also totally perfect for the part, as he felt he was like a modern day Douglas Fairbank Jr., as Cary definitely had the flare to be dashing and swashbuckling personality. Rob informs us that the castle in the film was at Haddon Hall in Derbyshire and is the home to the Manners Family. Haddon Hall is one of England's finest examples of a medieval manor house. The origins of the hall date to the 11th century. William Peverel, illegitimate son of William the Conqueror, held the manor of Haddon in 1087, when the survey was taken, which resulted in the Domesday Book, was undertaken. When we see the Cliffs of Insanity, it is a matte painting and is based on the actual Cliffs of Moher, which are located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland, which rise 120 metres (390 feet) above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head, which they actually filmed on location. When you see the brilliant and very realistic sword fighting sequences, especially between the actors Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin took roughly 10 days to film and both actors when not performing in front of the camewra, would take every opportunity to practice their fencing skills against each other and especially also with the Olympic fencing champion to get it 100% accurate. When you see the big rodent fighting scenes, the growling noise you hear are from Rob Reiner himself, but with the first recording session the engineer forgot to press the record button and Rob Reiner nearly lost his voice when they went to do the actual recording of his growling voice. When you see the two evil characters Chris Sarandon and Christopher Guest in the wood where they open the secret door in the tree, this was filmed in an actual wood forest near Heathrow Airport and every 30 seconds they had to stop filming because planes were flying over them. At around Chapter 12 at the 69 minutes mark, you finally get to see Rob Reiners hat hanging up in the Grandsons bedroom. When we see the late great Peter Cook performing the wedding ceremony, Rob informs us that this was one of his most favourite moments in the film. As we get to the end of the final scene in the Grandsons bedroom, when you get the close up of Peter Falk saying goodbye to his Grandson, this was actually filmed in Los Angeles, especially when Peter Falk says, As you wish. As the credits appear on the screen, Rob Reiner informs us that the song we hear was written by William De Ville, and so when the film credit appears on the screen, Rob Reiner says, Have fun storming the castle.

Audio Commentary by Author William Goldman: Here Bill Goldman informs us that he was the author of the original screenplay and of course the book, and he feels very spooky as he speaks, as this is the very first times he has viewed this film since seeing its original release in the cinema, and he very much liked the film very much and hopes he feels the same by the end of this audio commentary. When peter Falk gives the book to his Grandson, William really liked this particular scene. When we first see Cary Elwes and Robin Wright-Penn, William thought these two very handsome actors were perfectly cast, and also praises Robin for her perfect English accent; especially the young actress was born in America. William informs us that Norman Jewison gave Rob Reiner $16million dollars to make the film and despite it being a low budget film, they all made an effort to bring it under budget, which they did. When Cary and Mandy were not filming, they would take all opportunity to practice their sword fencing skills. Most of the time William talks about other actors in general not associated with this film, as well as talking about other films and not THE PRINCESS BRIDE, that he has done the screenplays for. William says that when he wrote the actual book, he at the time killed off Westley and cried, so re-wrote that section of the book to not kill of this character, but instead for him to be rescued and brought back to life. When we get to the wedding ceremony, William informs us that he thinks Peter Cook is a comic genius. As the credits appear at the end of the film, William was told by someone that if you cannot make a film at 1 hour and 50 minutes, then you have to make a much longer film, and has to be in the style of the director David Lean, and William was very pleased it was brought in at just 98 minutes, and he also says everyone put in a great effort and collaboration in doing a very great professional job and in fact William informs us that not a lot of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, and he really enjoyed it a lot and hopes everyone also enjoyed the film as much as William did.

Special Feature: True Love: THE PRINCESS BRIDE Phenomenon: Here we get to view two separate special features and they are as follows:

We hear that certain well known people wanted to make the film that included director Franois Truffaut, Norman Jewison and Robert Redford, but all turned the project down as they thought it was too odd ball. It was obviously set up to look more informal than it actually was, but it still works very well as a more conversational and nostalgic piece.

Special Feature: Love is Like a Storybook: Fairy Tales & THE PRINCESS BRIDE [2006] [1080i] [1.78:1] [16:44] Here we get an in-depth look into the myths of Fairy Tales and at the same time relate to scenes we view in the film THE PRINCESS BRIDE. It also looks how the director Rob Reiner combined and weaved all the elements of the Fairy Tales into the film. This becomes a very reasonable introspective and intriguing special feature. Narrated by Dennis Kleinman. Contributors include: Helen Pilinovsky Ph. D. [Columbia University], David Pesci [Author and Screenwriter] and Veronica Schanoes [University of Pennsylvania].

Special Feature: Miraculous Make-up: Creating Miracle Max [2006] [1080i] [1.78:1] [11:24] Here Billy Crystal [Miracle ma] talks about how his character was created evolved for the film THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Billy Crystal was asked how he would like to play his character and he would like his make-up to look and he tells us that he wanted it a cross between Charles Dillon ""Casey"" Stengel who was the American Major League Baseball right fielder and manager of the New York Yankees and Billys Grandmother and at the same time brought in photographs to help the Make-up Artist Peter Montagna get the character make-up totally perfect and to the satisfaction of Billy Crystal. We also get to see rare video footage at Shepperton Studios, Surrey, England in 1986, where we see Billy Crystal getting his make-up done by a much younger Peter Montagna.

Special Feature: Princess Bride: The Untold Tales [2007] [1080i] [1.37:1] [9:07] With this special feature it contains some more in-depth snippet interviews from the cast and crew. We also once again get some in-depth look behind-the-scene filming of THE PRINCESS BRIDE and how the actors all got on filming in the North of England. Contributors include: Robin Wright-Penn [Buttercup], Mandy Patinkin [Inigo Montoya], Fred Savage [The Grandson], Chris Sarandon [Prince Humperdinck] and Christopher Guest [Count Rugen].

Special Feature: Trailers and TV spots: Here we get to view three individual trailers that consist of: Theatrical Trailer [1987] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:08]; International Trailer [1987] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:13] and TV Spots [1987] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:31].

Special Feature: Photo Gallery [2006] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:45] Here we get to view a series of images from the film THE PRINCESS BRIDE, and at the same time you get to hear in the background the film music score.

BONUS: Original Theatrical Poster Enclosed.

Finally, since its release more than 30 years ago, THE PRINCESS BRIDE has often been copied, but never equalled. Perhaps the most successful fantasy film to capture its essential spirit was the animated film Shrek. The word ""brilliant"" is often overused in the film business, but this is one of those occasions when it is warranted. The Princess Bride is an unparalleled achievement? This is a modern classic that will be enjoyed for generations to come. It has been called the ""Generation X version of The Wizard of Oz, and more than any other description, that comes closest to identifying this film's impact. Although children generally appreciate THE PRINCESS BRIDE pseudo-fairy tale narrative and action-packed approach, but much of the dialogue is designed for adults. Mostly credited to screenplay of William Goldman, except for the Billy Crystal ad-libs, it is totally brilliant stuff. The quips traded by Inigo and Westley during their duel are as impressive as is the actual realistic swordsmanship. Vizzini's double-talk about which cup is poisoned during the battle of wits needs to be listened to several times before it begins to make twisted sense.

6853787,5,B00Q3F0GG4,"This is one of those sleeper classics that holds up well after 30 years. I have found the more I view this movie, the more I love it.  With a great script by two-time Academy Award winner-William Goldman-screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President's Men, and Marathon Man. this movie both entertains in the vein of other fantasy movies while poking gentle fun at the concept.  There are so many memorable speeches and scenes that only repeat viewing allows you to fully appreciate the wit and whimsy of this wonderful fractured fairy tale.  Directed with skill and pacing by Rob Reiner and led by such stalwart actors as Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright, Cary Elwes,and Chris Sarandon, this movie deserves to be added to your collection, whether you have a thousand titles or just a few. The transfer to Blu-Ray only sharpens the visuals making this movie even more delightful.  As Billy Crystal, in heavy make-up and nearly unrecognizable as a wizard, proclaims in an all too-brief scene-""Have fun storming the castle."" You can't help but have fun with this highly entertaining and original movie.",1513382400,2,1120,4.941489361702128

I expected the artwork to be either on the insert of the Blu-Ray packaging itself or to be on the sleeve that often accompanies movies. Instead, the artwork was literally a piece of cardboard stuck on the front of the movie case with a picture from the 25th Anniversary Edition on the insert.
