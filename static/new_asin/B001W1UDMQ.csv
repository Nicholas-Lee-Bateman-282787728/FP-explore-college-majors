3823738,5,B001W1UDMQ,"After buying a fiddle I needed to get started without having to go take lessons, This DVD is great for someone who has never touched a fiddle, he shows you everything you need to know to get started such as how to hold the fiddle, how to tune it, how to apply imaginery frets, how to bow, and how to play a few songs. I like the way he teaches it because he doesnt go too fast and he keeps telling you the names of the notes so you can learn them. He also has a guitar playing the song too so you can see what its like to play with a band. I cant wait to get the next volume.",1303171200,16,575,3.760330578512397
3823739,5,B001W1UDMQ,"When first learning the fiddle, I learned from this. Excellent video. It focuses on bluegrass standards (so you are learning tunes you can play with others instead of obscure tunes you can only play by yourself). His method seems to be: teach a basic version of standards, note for note. A great way to learn.
What is neat is, once you improve and get some tunes under your belt, you can learn to EMBELLISH. then you can take his easy versions, throw in your own embellishments and now you have a more advanced solo built on the building blocks he gave you.
Anyone starting out in fiddle, I recommend this video and tell them to skip all the others. This is excellent.",1294531200,24,668,4.483606557377049

8346874,5,B001W1UDMQ,"I really am enjoying this DVD, the guy really has his stuff together, but he references multiple times throughout the lessons that I'm supposed to refer to a book that was supposed to come with the DVD. I didn't receive any such booklet, which is probably why the DVD was so inexpensive. The listing didn't say anything about a book, so it's not like I expect one, but it would have been nice to know. Now i'm going to have to try to find the darn book that goes with it.

This DVD at least got me started and showed me the other tools that I needed to go along with my fiddle.

UPDATE: My bad, apparently if you put the DVD in the computer there's a PDF file booklet on the disk. That's what I get.",1485388800,3,699,4.094890510948905

8346882,4,B001W1UDMQ,"My 11 year old daughter, who dislikes any sort of violin practice involving reading sheet music, loves this DVD.  Jim Wood goes slow enough and simplifies the tunes enough that my daughter can pick up the songs very easily.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking to help their ""play by ear"" beginning fiddler get started or stay motivated to keep playing.",1309219200,16,360,4.790322580645161
