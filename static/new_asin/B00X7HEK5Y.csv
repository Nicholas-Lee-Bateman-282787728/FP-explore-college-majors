7162478,5,B00X7HEK5Y,"Remarkable Insight into the Life of an Epoch-Making Group of Artists
Although I did not expect it, I found LIFE IN SQUARES to be a remarkable piece of television drama, offering insights into the lives of the Bloomsbury Group that I had never previously thought of.

The title is a clever one, suggesting the bourgeois existence of the Stephen sisters Virginia and Vanessa (played by Lydia Leonard, Eve Best, Phoebe Fox, and Catherine McCormack across the three-episode structure) where they grew up in luxury, but also denoting imprisonment, both mental and emotional. David Roger's production designs, with elegant rooms heavily over-stuffed with curios of all historical periods, restrict the actors' freedom of movement; they are forced to move round chairs, or negotiate too many ornaments. When the Bloomsbury Group meet for their regular soires, they do so in small, confined rooms, with little room to breathe.

This kind of goldfish-bowl lifestyle inevitably has a significant effect on the Group's life-choices. While dedicating themselves to ideals of artistic purity that transcend the mundane concerns of early twentieth century Britain, we wonder whether that represents nothing more than a form of futile release from conformity. This is especially summed up in Vanessa Bell's checkered career; a talented artist in her own right, she becomes so much subject to her husband Clive's (Sam Hoare/ Andrew Havill's) bidding that she ends up losing her artistic will. She embarks on a long-term relationship with Duncan Grant (James Norton/ Rupert Penry-Jones), but finds little emotional satisfaction there - despite his undying devotion to her, he remains a professed homosexual.

Virginia experiences equal pains. We know from the start that she is mentally fragile, but it seems that her sister's overbearing nature, coupled with the prevailing ideology that all wives should have children at that time, pushes her into marriage with Leonard Woolf (Al Weaver. Guy Henry), Although the two enjoy a tranquil and often fulfilling life, it is not what Virginia wants. She tries to find solace in her writing, but even that is not enough to prevent her from committing suicide at the outbreak of World War II. From this drama, we get the sense of terrible sorrow that such an innovator should have felt so hemmed in by social and mental pressures that she should take her own life.

The sisters' existence does not change, even when they sacrifice London for the country, and Vanessa's family moves into Charleston, an idealized retreat still open to general visitors. Life there becomes even more claustrophobic, especially when Duncan's boyfriend David Garnett (aka Bunny) (Ben Lloyd-Hughes/ Jack Davenport) moves in. Vanessa is often forced into the role of unwilling peacemaker; at length she ends up doing something that she felt she must do, but ends up causing her lasting mental pain and suffering.

What makes LIFE IN SQUARES such a game-changing piece is that its sympathy extends to male and female characters alike. Would-be critics like Roger Fry (Elliott Cowan) are trying to make their way in the world as they pronounce on the effect of Modernism on the post-1918 universe, but they appear to lack the conviction to do so. This is chiefly due to their environment; the hothouse world of London (and provincial) society is so insulated from from worldly affairs that it ends up feeding on itself.

Brilliantly directed by Simon Kaijser from a script by Amanda Coe, LIFE IN SQUARES offers important material for reflection on the power as well as the limitations of the imagination, and how we must remain mindful of ourselves and our well-being rather than subjecting ourselves to the often restrictive dictates of prevailing socio-economic convention.",1473292800,21,3775,5.210873146622735
7162479,5,B00X7HEK5Y,"Beautifully done. As the reviewer said in the TLS, there are many Bloomsburys and choices must be made, good ones here. Smart to focus on the human drama of Vanessa: her sister, the genius Virginia, is harder to pull off - the film's weakness being a not good enough capture of the mercurial, incandescence ""Goat"" and the rather dry, not quite so nice as depicted, her husband, Leonard. Still-- mostly accurate to the facts/emotions as we have them, with actual as spoken quotes. Charleston recreated, Vanessa's home, realer than real .Photography that captures in tonality, the color and composition of Vanessa's early paintings. Splendid, sharp British acting, per usual, and a smart script that assumes you know the biographical context. Not too long, not too short, just right. Eve Best -as the older Vanessa, er, the best. You might ask ""why wasn't this issued in format ""all regions"" so even we poor Amuricans could enjoy it?  Played it on my computer- was lovely.",1472947200,14,970,4.950920245398773
7162480,4,B00X7HEK5Y,"I ordered this DVD because I'm a huge admirer of Eve Best's film and stage work. It was easy to follow the story line as it covers many years. Realistic study of the Bloomsbury group and how their lives intertwined.

7162482,3,B00X7HEK5Y,I was going along with this show for the first episode and a half and then they completely changed actors to play the same characters 10 - 20 years in the future.

7162486,4,B00X7HEK5Y,"I would LOVE a good English story set in 1905 but this one is not up my alley.  Two guys have sex off a public sidewalk....really. ""  I stopped about a 1/4 way through the first episode. I came weeks later and decided to finish it.  Yes, it is not a family movie.  The series is a true story about the Broomsbury Group, which is a group of English writers and artist that are somewhat too modern for their time...starting in the late 1800's. Yes, there is homosexual activity, births out of wedlock, drugs, and mental illness and this actually goes on for a few generations and really happened.  I knew nothing about the Broomsbury Group and now I know.  The filmography was beautiful with the English countrysides as were the period cars and clothes.  What confused was the actors started at age 20 and then went to 40 years old with different actors!!!  Don't understand why the original actors weren't dressed to look twenty years older as that was confusing. It was not my type of movie.",1527379200,9,991,4.52808988764045

Luckily I started watching this for myself first.

I had no idea of the historical content of this movie when I clicked on it - Virginia Woolf, her sister - Vanessa Bell, The Bloomsbury Group.

What a beautiful movie.  For anybody interested in the Bloomsbury Group- this movie is fascinating!  The focus is on Vanessa Bell, who is Virginia Woolf's sister.  The majority of the Group are all present in their wonderfully genius glory.

8715276,3,B00X7HEK5Y,"An advertisement for mental disorders--watching is like being in a a kind of brain fog (the grey and dark natural lighting doesn't help). Yet, from the many biographies and primary works I've read (as well as paintings viewed), it seems a fairly accurate look at the group. Howard's End, it's not (more sunshine in that one), although E.M. Forster was on the fringes of this cabal. The first time I heard about the Bloomsbury Group was my initial trip to London at 20--""Where they lived in squares and loved in triangles"". The series is about that--then moves to Charleston House, the Bell's country house (which you can go visit) in Sussex.

Still trying to get through to the third and final episode...Not something one can stomach in one sitting. Take many tea breaks with this one.
Rather makes one understand Virginia Woolf's hurry to leave this sordid world she inhabits with these characters. Both she and Vanessa had been sexually assaulted (Virginia the worst) as children and adolescents by their stepbrothers--which Virginia tried to tell everyone about and wrote about numerous times. I only mention this as Virginia's ""disorders"" and ""condition"" are much-mentioned. She had classic PTSD and other issues common to survivors of abuse.
Indeed, Leonard and Virginia's relationship is the healthiest as they write and both cope with their own psychologies. Makes one want to re-read V's works--you kind of ""get"" them better after watching this series.

Way too much time spent on Vanessa Bell's obsession with gay painter Duncan Grant, although the idea of what ""love"" is--romantic, filial, maternal--is explored, here.
You will find yourself searching the internet for more on all the characters:  Lytton Strachey (the actor who plays him here, spot on--for more, see the film Carrington), Robert Fry, Clive Bell, and Bunny Garnett (both lover of Duncan and future husband of Duncan's child with Vanessa--Angelica. The idea that they are creative types seems to excuse a lot of bad behavior. It's too bad that the ideal of ""freedom""--in relationships, in governments--never really works out to be so liberating.

There are actually some quite funny lines; I do think the series could use a bit more humor and some sunny days. The collective cognitive power in one sitting room was substantial.
They were all reading Freud and figuring things out--or not. Homosexuality was viewed as ""inversion"", so there's lots of discussions of that. I'm a bit baffled, if you've read at all about Bloomsbury, that one wouldn't know going in that there's going to be as much or more gay sex than hetero sex? So, if you're appalled by that sort of thing, don't watch. If you are more liberal, still, you'll find it a bit depressing.
If you ever get through Lytton Strachey's ""Eminent Victorians"", you'll actually find this series complements that, as well.",1528761600,2,2850,5.0574468085106385
8715277,3,B00X7HEK5Y,"Pretty much anything surrounding the ""Virginia Woolf"" period and you can guarantee an underlying despair. It's too bad that heartbreak and its constant need for a lustful release is what we have to deal with here. That and the world of artistic license and what we know of the intellectual mores of these people at a time when their world insisted on one kind of modern progress -- or dying in so called dismal mediocrity. They created their own vain Bohemia and I think even their own children began to see it. I wonder whose idea it was for their children to call them by first names, ""Nessa"" instead of ""mother.
""If I didn't care more than words can say - If I didn't care would I feel this way? If this isn't love then why do I thrill? And what makes my head go 'round and 'round - While my heart stands still?"" - The InkSpots
Why this series feels more bleak than anything; they are flawed human beings - all gifted, all daunted by their own ideals which become conflicted points for their own unhappiness. But then....There is nothing but art - life is art, love is art, wit is art, despair is art, sex is art, longing is art, loss is art and art is all. Vanquish, vanquish, vanquish...",1528329600,2,1192,4.373873873873874
