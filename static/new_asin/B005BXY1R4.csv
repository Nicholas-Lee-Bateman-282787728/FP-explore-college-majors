4649061,2,B005BXY1R4,"The thought and the message about the movie was good. However, I thought that there was something missing that most Hallmark movies have, it didn't move me as much as other Hallmark movies do. The storyline was sweet, but I thought the way things happened at the end was kind of wierd. all their time and money saved. I didn't get the point at the end, I guess.  I don't want to give away the movie, but please don't waste your money and just watch it off the Hallmark channel. one word, disappointment. watch The Christmas Wish instead!",1322438400,5,537,4.479591836734694

4649119,3,B005BXY1R4,"O. Henry's ""The Gift of the Magi"" is a 2,070-word short story. ""Gift of the Magi"" is an 85-minute film. One way to stretch the pithy short story to that length, I suppose, is to have the actors speak verrrrry slowly. The way the film chooses is to introduce subplots in this modern retelling of the classic.

As I assume most of the would-be viewers of this film are familiar with the short story, I'll discuss the changes. Some are trivial. In the story, for example, the last name of Della and Jim (the husband and wife) is Young. In the film, it's Alexander. The story has the article ""The"" at the beginning of the title; the film does not. Some are understandable for a modern retelling. Instead of a watch fob chain and hair combs, the gifts here are a steering wheel for a vintage car that Jim works on incessantly and a zoom lens for a camera that Della loves. I don't see any great harm in that change. But some changes are hard to understand and do detract from the qualities that made the short story so popular.

At this point, I face a problem. Describing the biggest change involves giving away a key element that occurs in the second half of the film and might well constitute a spoiler. I will say that there is a somewhat adult element added. By this, I mean that there's a plot element that parents might have to explain to children. There's neither graphic language nor graphic scenes, but imagine, if you will, if, in [...], Mrs. Cratchit had suspected Bob Cratchit of striking Tiny Tim. I should imagine parents would be uncomfortable explaining to children why an adult might hit a child. There's no physical abuse here, but there is an adult theme that might make this film less than ideal for children. And that's a shame since the original story is so simple.

One other problem is worth mentioning. Della and Jim must be poor for the story to work well, but their home and the possessions seem inconsistent with this point. Why films have a tendency to give even people with small incomes such spacious abodes is beyond me.

Ultimately, I found ""Gift of the Magi"" to be more reflective of many other contemporary Christmas films--couple in love encounters a problem that threatens to separate them, etc.--than of the original story. In this sense, it's probably OK for the considerable audiences those films obviously draw, especially those who haven't read the short story. But it's pretty pedestrian. For better film adaptations of O. Henry stories, try [...].",1351641600,9,2487,4.6454545454545455
4649120,5,B005BXY1R4,"I was so glad this video came out.  Some of the Christmas movies I have seen have not come out, hopefully they will soon.  This is a great movie about a young couple getting the idea about Christmas. It is not about receiving but willing to give up what you love to give the gift of love",1325376000,,287,4.017543859649122
4649121,2,B005BXY1R4,"This movie was okay for showing to children: no violence, sex, etc.  However, it really wasn't funny enough nor did it have any kids (1, but not a lead role) to keep a child's attention.  The wife lies to her husband repeatedly.  This causes a lot of marriage strife.  She easily walks out on him and he easily lets her walk out the door.  Not a lot of commitment between them.",1324166400,3,377,4.253521126760563
