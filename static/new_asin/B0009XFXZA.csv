2334428,5,B0009XFXZA,"Another very interesting work by Lee Strobel. Those of you who haven't viewed or read Lee Strobel are in for a treat. His books and DVD's are very intelligent, informative, and well produced.",1369267200,3,191,4.818181818181818
2334429,5,B0009XFXZA,"This documentary styled vid is excellent in content and arrangement. It doesn't go into a deep study of each prophecy. If you have even a fundamental understanding of the books (chapters) of the Bible,or are willing to do a little reading, it gives much for thought. I've studied many religions for comparison and this video reveals the evidence for the story of the life and defeat over death by Christ very well.

It's worth finding the right religion the first time since eternity is a really long time....",1366070400,,509,4.784090909090909

2334431,5,B0009XFXZA,"This video is amazing. It is a great tool to show to people who doubt that Jesus really is the Son of God. It also shows how ""man"" is not responsible for writing the Bible. God definitely guided the hand of the authors of the Bible because it is absolutely impossible for all these prophecies to come true unless God was responsible.",1276473600,3,333,4.387096774193548
2334432,5,B0009XFXZA,I got the CD is great condition.  Completely sealed up.  I haven't watch it yet because I haven't had to yet.  I bought it for a course I am taking online.  I don't need it until the 8th week of the course.  Thanks for your promptness.,1255305600,,235,4.021739130434782
2334433,4,B0009XFXZA,"The strength in this film lies in the fact that it comes very near to matching the production value of documentaries on A&E, History, or Discovery.  The cinematography and graphics are all done very well, the orchestral score is powerful, and the scripture narration (by John Rhys-Davies and Karen Scheeland) is amazing.  Therefore, this is a great introduction to a beginning Christian.  However, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to an atheist friend, nor a seasoned Christian, because it is very basic in its presentation.  Popular author Lee Strobel and pastor Greg Laurie are good at presenting the basic position, but are certainly not scholars, and the scholars present do not give enough background on the issues to fully flesh-out the argument the film wishes to present.  I would have liked to have seen more scholars and more in-depth investigation.  Still, for an introduction to Bible prophecy, this is well composed, slickly executed, and enjoyable to watch.",1230940800,8,974,5.211538461538462
2334434,3,B0009XFXZA,"I thought it was short of information and long on meaningless pictorials.

I gave it 3 stars because what it presents is bare bones basic but accurate. I am a new student of the Bible, and this did not present new information for me. Maybe I just expected too much because I was so enthusiastic about the topic :)

While this is no substitute for reading the Bible, it is a good and accurate start that will hopefully whet your appetite to read more of it because there is more information in the Bible which ties the Old and New Testaments together than this.

I apologize if I sound ungrateful, as I sincerely appreciate their efforts in this great, necessary and somewhat difficult topic.  The world could certainly could use more efforts along these lines.",1212796800,14,760,4.607407407407408
