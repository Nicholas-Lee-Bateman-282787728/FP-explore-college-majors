8110630,5,B000EJ9VOS,"I am a 40 year old Mom of 3 children.  My 10 year old son and I love Naruto and watch it together weekly.  I started watching it about 1 year ago with him and loved the very first episode.  Yes, in America we have the English version of Naruto and the diehard fans out there would rather watch the subtitled original version, but I personally like this version better.  There isn't as much violence either in the English version.  Naruto has many messages that are good to teach our children.  It's not just about fighting, it's about working hard to reach your goals.  It's about friendship, respect and the need to overcome hardships in your life.  Shhhh, don't tell any kids who watch that it has these messages though, they might stop watching!",1163030400,6,748,4.529850746268656
8110631,4,B000EJ9VOS,"After all of the controversy over the first volume of Naruto you know and you don't know what to expect on volume two. You know this DVD will have bad voice acting and all of the violence and bad words will be cut out of it. So for those of you who have already seen the import will be expected to stay far away from this second volume. For you newcomers this is what is on volume two and trust me it's nothing nice.

Naruto and his new pals Sasuke and Sakura are tired of being treated like kiddy ninja's and they want a real mission worthy of the talent they think they have. Kakashi gives them what they want and gives them the simple task of escorting the bridge builder Tazuna to the land of waves. This sounds simple to them but it is far from easy and the crew is in for some good training. They are attacked by the infamous Zabuza Momochi and he  has a surprise guest for them all. This DVD is the beginning of some of the best duels you will see on Naruto.",1142121600,2,965,4.073684210526316
