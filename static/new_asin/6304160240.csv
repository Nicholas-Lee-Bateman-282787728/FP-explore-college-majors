794601,5,6304160240,"This is a wonder film of love and how people helped people in WWII. These nuns took such a huge risk to save Jewish childen. The children were so very brave in a horriable time of history.

I love this film. Good for even grade school children.",1212364800,3,244,4.191489361702128
794602,5,6304160240,"Great family movie with good moral lessons. Fear can cause you to do things you normally wouldn't, people have more in common that not regardless of their nationality, and there are more good people in the world that bad.",1206921600,,221,4.6923076923076925
794603,5,6304160240,"Miracle at Moreaux is an inspirational film about overcoming prejudice and the persecution of Jews in WWII.  It shows how a group of children harbor hatred and fear for Jews based on the teachings of their parents.  When three Jewish children attempt to escape Nazi-occupied France, they become stranded at a French Boarding School run  by a Catholic Sister.  The Sister and her charges hide the Jewish children and help them on their journey.  In the process, they learn that Jewish people are no different from themselves.  They learn that there is no place for hatred in our world.  It is a lovely film that I use each year in my classroom. I feel it is appropriate for 3rd grade and up.",1182902400,7,690,4.60655737704918
794604,5,6304160240,"This film, set in World War II France, deals with a group of Christian students at a boarding school run by a Catholic nun. While they are preparing for a Christmas pageant that their parents will attend, three Jewish children appear at their school hungry and frightened. These three children need sanctuary from the Nazis. The nun, played by Loretta Swit, runs the school and must deal with the Nazis and the fear the Catholic children have of both the Jews and the Nazis finding out about their presence at the school.

This unwarranted fear of the Jewish children and the real threat from the Nazis are dealt with in this movie. And the film will end before you realize it. This is a small reminder of fear generated by the Nazis in World War II in the areas that they occupied. It teaches a good lesson in doing what is morally correct instead of what is expedient or in ones own self-interest. It is a good film for the whole family. And is a good viewing choice for the Christmas holiday.",1181001600,11,995,4.467032967032967

794697,5,6304160240,"Perfect for my 5th grade class during our World War 2 unit.  It was appropriate for their age level and evoked some emotional feelings for the Jewish community, as well as the Germans who risked their lives to help them escape.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an accurate portrayal for a young audience.",1408233600,,325,4.586206896551724
794698,4,6304160240,"This movie was based on the book, Twenty and Ten, which was read by my fourth grade class last year.  It was nice to compare the two mediums, and helped the students understand the text better.  The plot was slightly altered from the book.",1404864000,,239,4.409090909090909

794701,4,6304160240,"A good WWII movie that children can watch.  It is loosely based on the book Twenty and Ten which my daughter and I read.  As most movies, it is not as good as the book, but still worth watching.",1396310400,,194,3.948717948717949

794704,5,6304160240,One of the best Holiday movies I have ever seen! It the story about a nun in Nazi Germany who helps harbor three Jewish children. How the catholic children try to deal with mixed feelings of helping and trying to be safe themselves. This is so beautiful and it shows children compassion on so many levels. I recommend it to everyone who loves history. Great Hanukkah story or Christmas story!!,1384473600,,393,4.628571428571429
794778,5,6304160240,"This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas stories.  Should be seen by adults and children to gain an understanding of other people.  Not all Germans were monsters during WWII, as this movie demonstrates.  The French children learn compassion for others, as well.",1383264000,,266,5.1395348837209305
794779,5,6304160240,"Saw this film several times on PBS when it was presented as a Holiday Season favorite, and again recently when I acquired an old VHS tape of it.  It is a very moving and suspenseful drama.  I've found it meaningful each time I've seen it.  It isn't exactly a ""family movie,"" nor is it exactly a ""children's movie.""  Audiences of any age could appreciate it, and at any time of the year.

I think that St. Christopher has been judged within the last 50 years to have been a mythic figure and is no longer given a place of honor among the Roman Catholic communion of popular saints, but this film/story makes use in a subtle way of the tale about how a big, strong man named Christopher supposedly once carried the Christ child (in the form of those who were figuratively Himself) across a river to safety.  The ""miracle"" at Moreaux is about 3 fugiture Jewish children equated (in a Christmas play that takes place within the story) with the Holy Family.  At the same time, it is a story about initially fearful and resentful Christian children who grow very close to the Jewish children and become eager to save them from an evil fate.  The Jewish children are drawn into an increasingly appreciative and loving circle.

The ""Lights"" of Hannakuh and their symbolism also play a powerful--and beautiful--role in this story.

The story takes place December 3 and 4, 1943, when the Jewish children become marooned at a Catholic school on the way to connect with a Resistance guide who is supposed to take them to Barcelona and freedom. Almost all who've reviewed the story here have told its plot, which I regret because it may rob future viewers of the suspense they might otherwise experience; I won't tell anymore of the plot myself.

I remember the film version that I saw on PBS as being slightly different than the film version on this VHS tape I've got which is dated 1985.  I thought both versions were excellent renditions of an excellent story, though.  Ideally, this film would make a good showing on the media during the Christmas and Hannakuh season, but I read the review by a Jewish reviewer who said that the details about the Jewish Hannakuh celebration were inaccurate and that the movie was a bummer from the Jewish point of view.  I wonder which details were incorrect.  Maybe yet another version of the film should be made which gets the Jewish references to the Hannakuh tradition Right.  It is such a good story with the potential for quelling enmity and bringing greater love and harmony to the two religious groups.",1366243200,,2536,4.6524663677130045
794780,4,6304160240,"Everything was fine.
This is replacing a VHS tape that we already had.
The DVD worked fine when it arrived",1362614400,,106,4.35
794781,5,6304160240,"I teach 6th grade and used the film as part of reading class.
After reading the book (Twenty and Ten) students viewed the movie. It provided great context for writing one of the four required comparison/contrast papers.
The plot, while not complicated, provided good suspense for ""tweens"" and I enjoyed it too.",1359936000,,310,4.980769230769231

794784,5,6304160240,I first saw this movie when released to my local PBS station. I tried for years to find this movie. It is so well done. Loretta Swit was awesome. This movie opened my eyes to many of the Jewish tradtions and meanings and how they relate directly to my own Christian faith. Watch with open eyes and heart. You may find something out about yourself that you did not think of before viewing.,1296777600,,388,4.328767123287672
794785,3,6304160240,The video arrived in good condition.  It is a movie version of a book Twenty and Ten by Claire Huchet Bishop about group of Jewish children sent to a French refuge during WWII.  The movie is loosly based on the book.  The book was much better.,1265328000,,243,4.239130434782608
794786,2,6304160240,"B-rated type film, fair quality.

We bought this film for Khanukkah, and watched it and thought ""oy veh.""  The audience is encouraged to embrace both Khanukkah as well as Xmas (though Xmas is observed by the majority of the cast).  Without wanting to use this review as a forum to discuss Xmas at this time, let's just say if you want an Xmas film that's what you'll get....but if you want a Khanukkah film...you'll be disappointed.  For our personal beliefs in the Biblical and historical accuracy of Khanukkah, and it's relationship to Israel & the Messiah, we'd say ""don't buy.""  Bummer.",1261353600,4,590,4.801980198019802

I wasn't expecting HD quality by any means as this movie was filmed over 30 years ago (1985). But I can't imagine the original filming quality was this bad. My VHS copy is better quality than this DVD. The sound has a lot of hissing feedback. The picture is very blurry and grainy. For spending over $21 on this DVD, I'm very dissapointed.",1514937600,,467,4.258426966292135
