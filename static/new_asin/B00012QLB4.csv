1968223,4,B00012QLB4,"Matchstick men is a change of pace for director Ridley Scott's recent (and near future) work. After big, Oscar worthy blockbuster films like Gladiator, Hannibal and Black Hawk Down, he gives us this *little* film about con artists.
Nicolas Cage gives a great performance as Roy, a con artist with obsessive compulsive disorder and a life trashed by divorce, who after visiting a new psychiatrist agrees to meet the daughter he has never met (played by the lovely Alison Lohman, don't be fooled - she plays 14, but she's actually 24!!).
After spending some time with Angela, Roy decides to accept an offer from his partner (the always great Sam Rockwell) to con some guy out of a lot of money. However, as with most heist flicks, things are never what they seem to be and the con turns sour on Roy with unexpected results.
The visuals, the dialogue, the acting and Hans Zimmer's score make this a must see.
The only aspect of this film that I didn't enjoy was the ending (more like a coda), which seemed a bit forced and out of place (and pace) with the rest of the movie.",1072742400,,1071,4.525773195876289
1968224,4,B00012QLB4,"Matchstick Men serves as a virtual manual in the complex art of screen acting. Nicholas Cage scores one of the greatest triumphs of his turbulent career as an obsessive-compulsive con-artist who fears fresh air, ticks, and dirt and devours an endless series of pills to keep from obsessing over the unkempt appearance of his carpet. Faced with the challenge of portraying an individual who is characterized by his emotional instability and diversity, Cage effortlessly changes the tone and texture of his performance from scene to scene and conveys a greater range of emotions than most actors tackle in half a dozen movies. He is unabashedly charismatic and debonair as he convinces elderly ladies that the key to achieving a fabulous prize is to transfer money into his bank account, frighteningly compelling as he desperately begs a psychiatrist for stabilizing medication and remarkably poignant as he reflects on his inability to form meaningful connections with other people. Cage's work is complemented brilliantly by the supporting performances of Sam Rockwell and Allison Lohman, which each express a sardonic perceptiveness and youthful zest for life that plays remarkably well against the leading actor's edgy paranoia.

As it turns out, the movie that contains these Oscar worthy characterizations isn't half bad either. The engaging script by Ted and Nicholas Griffin tells the story of Roy Waller (Cage), a ""matchstick man"" whose life is turned upside down when he learns that he is the father of a spirited adolescent girl named Angela (Lohman). Roy's humorous efforts to become a doting and morally responsible parent complicate his profitable partnership with wisecracking con-man Frank Mercer (Rockwell) and ultimately threaten his efforts to swindle a conniving business executive (Bruce McGill) out of several million dollars. The film abounds with dozens of scenes that radiate warmth and charm, including a delightful sequence where Roy teaches Angela the craft of con artistry by helping her convince an overworked housewife that she has won the lottery, a humorously touching episode when Angela attempts to teach her insecure father how to bowl and an indescribably hilarious moment when Frank tries to get under his neurotic partner's skin by coming on to him in an airport (this is worth the price of admission alone). Director Ridley Scott also enlivens the proceedings by featuring an appropriately glossy soundtrack of old Sinatra tunes and reflecting the mood of the characters in the nature of cinematography (Ray's ultra neat home has a sterile, blue texture and the outdoor locations are all uncomfortably bright to stress Ray's discomfort in the open air).
Regrettably, Scott has chosen to saddle this charming film with a clever but heartless ""twist"" ending that undermines much of the character growth that the audience has just witnessed. I left the theater feeling as swindled and abused as one of Ray's hapless victims, although some of my companions admired the sheer audacity the director displayed by drastically defying the audience's expectations. These rich and vivid characters deserved a better fate than Scott dealt them, and the talented actors most certainly should have demanded more emotionally satisfying material. However, as the old saying goes, when one has just enjoyed a delicious and opulent feast, it is silly to complain that your coffee is a little cold.",1072224000,,3417,5.316081330868761
1968225,4,B00012QLB4,"Nicholas Cage is finally back with a movie that is as much of a thriller as you've been exposed to in 2003 -- explosive bucaneers of the seas, clumsy terminators and desperate really, really ""bad"" boys -- and yet without all that somatic high-octane action.
As a mystery tale with delectable twists, the movie has a handful of surprises in store, some more convincing than others, although I had a nagging suspicion about the final big twist which did come true (somewhat of a gyp with a twister tale.) To mess it further, all of the pretty suave turns in the movie were thrown to the dogs in an absolutely feel-good denouement...
Other than that, this is a very watchable movie. The execution is brilliant, film students take note of the camerawork and the screenplay. Above all, Nick Cage is really the cornerstone of the movie's class, his potrayal of someone with a cleanliness (and darkness) OCD is the stuff that Oscars are handed out for.
Some of the negative reviews talk of the morally challenged script. Well, I never for a moment felt that Cage's or Rockwell's characters were oblivious of their follies. That they were depicted in a likeable manner does not mean that the script advocates or endorses their behavior.
This is no ""Get Shorty"" in style or story, but is quite a decent rental nonetheless. Recommended.",1072137600,,1326,4.769565217391304
1968226,5,B00012QLB4,"Nicholas Cage is brilliant in this movie.  I think he definitely should recieve an oscar nomination for his performance in this movie.  He is an excellent actor.  Moving on,  I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could.  The movie is heart-warming and extremely funny.  Cage bounces around the room and snitches and twitches and we can really see his how desperate he is.  The story is great and the acting is supurb with a complex but wonderful climax.  Think of this movie and a modern ""The Sting""",1071878400,,500,4.53932584269663

1968254,5,B00012QLB4,"This is one film I think is greatly underrated.  Nicholas cage plays Roy- a conman who lives alone and fears the outside world in just about every way, including having a life.  He finds out that he has a 14-year-old daughter and decides to meet her.  Their bond brings him out of his reclusive ways to a point and Roy discovers a lot of things bout himself and his new little family.  Sam Rockwell plays his wise ass, but sympathetic partner, Frank.

I really like the feel of this film.  It's soundtrack features Sinatra and other smooth tunes that I enjoyed a lot.  This is not a pulse-pounder or adrenaline junkie film, but there are a few tense moments.  It's more about Roy's own conscience driving him to be a better man, although he definitely needs help in getting there.

I really enjoy this film more and more every time I watch it.  If you're a fan of crime movies and like a comedic twist to the story along with good character development, this film is definitely for you.  Included is a nice little ""making of"" featurette.",1456358400,2,1037,4.491978609625669

1968310,1,B00012QLB4,"I normally don't give ratings to movies, especially bad ones. But something needs to be said about this movie, because I got the feeling that it attempted to start some kind of ""trend"". So, according to my opinion this movie has the following characteristics.

- An EXTREMELY predictable plot. Note the capital letters. Within the first few moments of the film, it's actually obvious where this is going. Note that there are only three characters on the DVD cover. The whole movie is practically like that: a drama between three people.

- The ending is the most cringe-worthy, vomit-inducing, piece of crap ever to be shot on film. I don't want to spoil it (more than it already is) but I'll just give you this picture: Imagine Nicholas Cage as a Christian in the Colosseum. He sees his family being eaten by the lions. Then, it's his turn. Just as the lions are digesting him, his head pokes out from the lion's mouth and says to Nero: ""I hope we can still be friends"".

So, if your children ever lose their jump rope, you can use the main character's spine.",1394064000,,1060,4.568421052631579
1968311,4,B00012QLB4,"I normally cant stand Nicholas Cage. I find him to be an actor thats losing his looks and is not dealing with it gracefully and try to cling to roles that, sadly, are not suited for him any more. Roy, neurotic, flim flam man however is a role that suits his well. He is a con artist that specializes in stealing money from medium income families naive enough to get sucked into their schemes with the help of his partner played by Sam Rockwell.

Roy is special in this role because while he can successfully pull off a con he is in dire need of his medication, without it, he becomes obsessive compulsive about cleaning, agoraphobic and replete with a whole host of facial ticks and jerks which makes him very unpleasant to deal with.

When Roy loses his medication he needs to see a new psychologist who gets him pills, as well as discusses the possibiilty of reconnecting with the money he left when she was 2 months pregnant. Now a 14 year old girl he starts entering his life, while still trying to do these multilayered cons, granted to guys who really deserve being heist. Well the worlds start to mix and before you know it  hes bonding with her, teaching her his business, and having difficulty with whats right and whats wrong.

Roy has always been excellent at keeping the cons separate from the normal pace of his life and now all of it is embroiled into a mess. As the story continues we find out that while he believes he is the con master his partner/protegee have been pulling one over him, without giving away too much lets say that its an expensive lesson for him to learn but despite that it seems that everyone takes away with something and the ending while sweet is not overwrought.

Overall: quite enjoyable.",1392595200,,1729,4.493630573248407

1968329,5,B00012QLB4,"Its hard to tell someone why this movie is so good without giving away too much... Matchstick Men isn't quite a con movie, its more like a movie about con men. Dont expect any grandiose and overblown cons like in Oceans Eleven. Here, the con is just a day job; its what these people do to make a living; its secondary to the actual story being toldor so you're lead to believe.

The fun thing about con artist movies is that you get to be taken along with a crew as they mastermind and orchestrate some elaborate string of deception that ultimately results in a big payday. Most of us wish we could pull something like that off, but in reality, were not con men, were just marks -- which is why I love these types of movies, they're pure wish fulfillment.

However, in a lot of recent con movies, the viewers are no longer being allowed to follow the exploits of the con artists, they're merely being shown an incomplete series of events -- just so the filmmakers can have a big reveal at the end and say, We got you! Instead of being part of the crew, the viewer is now just another mark. Because the characters are actually deceiving the viewer, it makes them unsympathetic, and in the end, you don't really care about what happens to them. You watch the movie not for fun, but to see if you can figure out the con within the con. It undermines the entire point of going to see a con movie.

Thats why Matchstick Men is so cool. Yes, several cons do take place during the course of the movie, but the story is really about the characters, not that ultimate big payday. Then, when the big reveal comes at the end of the movie, you actually share in the characters emotional plight rather than hating him. Its perfectly orchestrated and totally logical. And thats why a truly great con works, because it gets you so caught up in emotion that you forget to think -- not by deleting scenes and holding back pieces of the story.",1358294400,,1925,4.3565459610027855

1968333,5,B00012QLB4,"Cage is a man obsessed. Very obsessed. He is in a line of work where the truth is a commodity at best. Truth and trust, two very sharp double-edged swords. It is a movie about those things, and about personal growth and redemption. Underneath the surface, it is very much a love story. I couldn't believe it came out in 2003 and I have never heard of it. So many good movies end up getting lost on the dingy shelves of rental stores. I am glad I finally saw Matchstick Men. It is a five-star movie in every aspect.

I always enjoy reading the hater reviews, the one stars. They almost always contain comments such as ""this was not what I thought it was.""  How old is the internet now?

The best ones, in my opinion, are The Sting, Reservoir Dogs, Catch Me If You Can, Spanish Prisoner (Steve Martin is exceptional), and yet another Steve Martin flick, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  Add to this the wonderful Matchstick Men.  It is by far one of Nick Cage's best roles.  He plays Roy Waller, a con-man with severe OCD, which, in and of itself, is a peculiar twist.  Roy, along with his partner, Frank, played by the always reliable Sam Rockwell, is a career criminal, who expertly pulls off reasonably safe cons, extorting thousands from unsuspecting targets.

Then along comes not only Roy's long lost daughter (Alison Lohman should have been nominated for her portrayal as the coy, callow, Angela), but the chance for one hell of a big time con.

I won't give away details, but suffice it to say, nothing is as it seems.  With a tight script, top notch acting, and agile directing by Ridley Scott, Matchstick Men is a delight.",1343952000,,986,4.758823529411765

The film starts slow but then takes on a brilliant flow, from the beginning itself, you are easily glued to the screen, totally engaged in the characters, specially 'Roy' played brilliantly by Nicholas Cage, 'Roy' is a person who will communicate to you with just his eyes and facial expressions and Cage effortlessly breathes enough life into the character, making this one of his best performances without a doubt and it is actually 'Roy' you are witnessing and not the actor Nicholas Cage. Surprisingly brilliant performance from Alison Lohman who plays 'Angela'. The chemistry between Cage and Lohman are just enough to get you involved in the whole scenario of the film. A similarly good performance from Sam Rockwell as well. 'Matchstick men' will surely draw you to its situations, the moods and mostly its characters.

1968344,4,B00012QLB4,"I've heard good things about Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"", released in 2003, but was reluctant to give it a try since it was about two con-men. It's hard, after all, to care about the outcome of a story if its main characters are swindling scumbags who make their living by ripping others off. Let 'em be wiped off the face of the planet for all I care. But everyone universally praised the film and said it had a good ending that catches the viewer off guard, so I finally decided to check it out.

Nicolas Cage's character, Roy, is crippled by obsessive-compulsion disorder, likely a physical consequence of the guilt of his criminal lifestyle, which he tries to justify (""I don't take money from people; they give it to me""). He sees a shrink and relies on meds to deal with his condition. Ultimately Roy and his partner (Sam Rockwell) happen upon a big score. At the same time his life is complicated but also blessed by the appearance of a 14 year-old daughter he never knew he had (alison Lohman).

The story is good all the way through but the last act & epilogue in particular are worth the price of admission.

I like how the movie emphasizes that love is more important than money, and more devastating to lose as well. And also that, if one truly has a worthy and noble heart, it will ultimately vomit out foolish, selfish and unnatural inclinations & actions. Redemption is always there, no matter how bad you are, but you have to want freedom enough to choose it and change.

I don't want to say anymore because the less you know the better.

The film runs two hours and was filmed in the Los Angeles/Anaheim/Venice areas.",1280275200,2,1638,4.538983050847458
1968345,5,B00012QLB4,"I love Ridley Scott.  He is one of those directors who are capable of doing almost anything.  Sure, he has had some misfires in the past, and he will continue to have a few, but overall he has proven that he can sink into nearly any genre with ease and deliver something memorable.

`Matchstick Men' is a light yet striking film that could stand tall with the best Scott has been able to produce.

The film revolves around two con men, Roy and Frank, who find their operation flipped on its head with the sudden appearance of Angela.  This young teenager claims to be Roy's daughter.  This is news to him, but he learns to accept the possibility, and over time the two form a bond, especially when it becomes apparent that Angela possesses the same knack that Roy has for his `profession'.  Frank is less than thrilled about this new development, but he doesn't really have much of a say in the matter.

Just wait for the twist!

What I like so much about this film is that it possesses a light and airy vibe that suits the whole genre very well.  This is a `sting' film, a crime comedy that capitalizes on the swift humor to create a complete aura.  The visual style is very bleached, as if it has been sitting out in the sun too long.  I love that visual.  It's kind of like someone took the breezy feel of Woody Allen's `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' and baked it.

I also give Scott credit for coaxing out of the cast some of their best work to date.  Everyone and their mother knows my dislike for Nicolas Cage.  He is such an unnatural actor.  That said, he has shone in films that capitalize on his ticks and force him to create something natural out of them.  This is one of his finest performances.  Using Roy's OCD as a building block, Cage actually creates a believable and engaging character in Roy.  Sam Rockwell is lauded by a lock of my cinephile friends, but I find him highly overrated.  Here he sinks into the dramedy aspect of the film effortlessly, and while it isn't a `standing ovation' type supporting role, he definitely `supports' the film very well.  Alison Lohman taps into Angela's soft side to great effect (it was needed to sell some of the more intimate aspects of her character development, and also that of Roy's).

`Matchstick Men' is good breezy fun with a great (totally unexpected) twist that will leave you blindsided (and conflicted in your amusement).  This is definitely worth your time and attention.  You may have missed this one (it didn't get the publicity it deserved) but once you see it you won't forget it.",1277942400,4,2551,4.505446623093682
1968346,3,B00012QLB4,"I found the extra feature, an extended take on how director Ridley Scott made the movie, to be more interesting than the actual film, which I had to pause a few times to get through. Nicolas Cage's various tics here as an obsessive-compulsive are uncomfortable to watch, though his performance is great, as usual for Cage. The sets in suburban Los Angeles were interesting to look at. Even the Sinatra soundtrack - why, really? - wasn't bad. I guess it was the plot that let me down. Also, is it a comedy or a character study? You find out in the extra that this question vexed the post-production, as well. The major plot twist that occupies the final 20 percent of the film wasn't all that surprising. A passing entertainment.",1268784000,,728,4.607692307692307

1968348,5,B00012QLB4,"Meet Roy and Frank, a couple of professional small-time con artists. What Roy, a veteran of the grift, and Frank, his ambitious protege, are swindling these days are ""water filtration systems,"" bargain-basement water filters bought by unsuspecting people who pay ten times their value in order to win bogus prizes like cars, jewelry and overseas vacations, which they never collect. These scams net the men a few hundred here, another thousand there, which eventually adds up to a lucrative partnership. Roy's private life, however, is not so successful. An obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe with no personal relationships to call his own, Roy is barely hanging on to his wits, and when his idiosyncrasies begin to threaten his criminal productivity he's forced to seek the help of a psychoanalyst just to keep him in working order. While Roy is looking for a quick fix, his therapy begets more than he bargained for: the revelation that he has a teenage daughter, a child whose existence he suspected but never dared confirm. What's more troubling, 14-year-old Angela wants to meet the father she never knew. At first, Angela's appearance disrupts her neurotic father's carefully ordered routine. Soon, however, with his own unique spin on parenthood, Roy begins to enjoy a relationship he never dreamed of having with his daughter. But while he develops paternal feelings for the 14-year-old, she's developing a fascination with Daddy's questionable career. This is the kind of movie that will have you putting pieces together, long after it ends. It is an intriguing and rewarding movie, and shouldn't be missed.",1265673600,2,1613,5.231660231660232

1968350,4,B00012QLB4,"Matchstick Men was much better than I thought it was going to be. As soon as I saw that Nicolas Cage was playing a con man with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) I thought it would get tedious in no time, but Cage handled it well. OCD was an important aspect of his character, and it also influenced the outcome. Cage won an Oscar for playing an alcoholic who is ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and his performance here is up near that level. He really has a knack for playing afflicted characters.

Sam Rockwell, as Frank, his partner, was pretty good; but Alison Lohman, as his daughter, Angela, was spectacular. There are tender moments between the daughter and her estranged father that are really touching, and that is hard to do. How easily it becomes cloying if handled wrong. Alison as Angela was very believable as the daughter, who has inherited her father's gift for grift.

Matchstick Men continually surprises, and that is good. Nothing is as it seems, and there are some really clever twists. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, really knows his business. There was great choices of music throughout. Frank Sinatra, The Tijuana Brass, Nino Rota, Bobby Darin, Roxy Music, Kid Rock, and more. Each song was carefully chosen and placed so it commented on the action, but didn't really draw attention to itself and away from the story, because it just seemed so right for the moment.

Bottomline is Matchstick Men is a good film from Ridley Scott, but it is not as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner-The-Director-s-Cut/dp/0790729628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)</a>.

1968351,3,B00012QLB4,"The Bottom Line:

Matchstick Men might appeal more to people who haven't seen a lot of films about con men, but if you're familiar with the genre you'll find very little here to get excited about; though the characters are developed to the point where you care what happens to them at the end, the machinations of the screenplay are exceedingly familiar and contrived and prevent the story from earning entry into the upper echelon of the genre with Mamet's films and The Sting.

The movie is much more interesting when Angela showed up. Alison Lohman is natural, eager and smart as her papa. Only she was actually 22 when she played the 14-year old.

1968355,4,B00012QLB4,"This movie is ""La Dolce Vita"" ""lite"" for those of us who may have trouble parsing the densely packed Fellini original for the moral. I was thinking about the line from one of Paul's epistles where he says, ""There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end is death."" Fellini's ""Vita""--and now Matchstick Men (""MM"")--are entrants in the canon of films that explore this idea. It takes more work to get this out of ""Vita,"" because the hero (Marcello Rubini, played by Mastroianni) is so clean-cut and well-intentioned--we could all plausibly want what he wants--so Fellini had his work cut out for him driving us to the conclusion that, no, we *don't* want what Marcello wants; the end thereof is death. The anti-heroes from MM are pre-fabed lost souls; we are quite unlikely to want what they want, and are chomping at the bit to see something give. So when Cage's daughter shows up, we can almost hear the strains of Bobby Darin singing ""The Good Life"" returning to us in our mind's ear.

Add to all this the sweet, almost reverential, use of Rota's ""Vita"" incidental music in the ""airport"" and there's no mistaking it; Ridley Scott most assuredly had some tipping of the chapeau to Fellini in mind as he worked out the details of this movie. Fellini fans should take note and indulge in a controlled swoon during this sequence.

So: Is the film good? Here's my experience. Like many others commenting in these pages, I felt left a little high and dry by the ending--it just wasn't realistic, and I felt the mythic payload of the movie didn't compensate; it didn't feel like the suspension of disbelief required to accept the ending paid off adequately. However, the film grew on me over the next day. I went back and watched it again, and started to warm up to the overarching theme; the trap of the ""sweet life."" MM is an accessible ""Vita."" Some people were put off by the film's final shot before they fade to black. I wasn't. Call me a sappy romantic greenass, but I was deeply touched. This *very* lost soul has finally figured it out; and he got his lesson from life experiences that had been architected to con him. Fascinating!",1247011200,,2140,4.584856396866841

He make hell of money which he keeps in his bank locker. His protege is Sam Rockwell, a foul mouthed guy. Cage suffers from Panic attacks, Agoraphobia, OCD and his rituals involve cleaning, Counting 3 when closing and opening doors and also Trouttes syndrome. He takes treatment from a cocky psychiatrist.

I wondered if it was a special effect ! She acts with effortless ease displaying teenage emotions of naughtiness, innocence, affection and bickering. A treat to watch her.

1968363,5,B00012QLB4,"Matchstick Men is a widescreen DVD adapted from the Eric Garcia novel of the same name. The movie stars Nicolas Cage and his close friend Sam Rockwell, and introduces audiences to Alison Lohman. The disc also includes some nice extras, such as Tricks of the Trade: Making Matchstick Men.

A glance at early scenes reveals Roy Waller (Cage) as a conman with OCD. He's partnered with Frank (Rockwell) -- both pose as FBI to solicit account numbers and signatures to drain their marks. Franks adverse reaction to pills nearly sinks them. Frank also visits the supermarket to see Kathy (Kelley.)

The routine Roy follows is disrupted when his medication falls down the drain at the kitchen sink and his condition confines him to the house. His source for the pills has also fled town; he needs a new shrink to write prescriptions. This is how we meet Dr. Harris Klein (Altman.)

Caught in the plight of talking to Klein to score pills, Roy reveals details of an old marriage -- and that he may have a child he's never seen. The good doctor intervenes, and after some phone calls he arranges a meeting between twelve year old daughter Angela (Lohman) and Roy.

His first meeting with the girl clicks, but she ruins a flimflam when she materializes on Roy's doorstep. He claims he's an antiques dealer, but leaving her alone in his house allows snooping (bundled cash, guns!) that uncovers lies. Frank and Roy also ensnare Chuck Frechette (McGill) at the Spearmint Rhino.

Some of the outstanding scenes in Matchstick Men occur only after Angela and Roy get into an argument, and she persuades him to teach her a con. He explains the system of the con this way: 1. Never work near where you live, 2. Don't write anything down, and 3. Be flexible.

The father and daughter pull off the con effortlessly, after visiting a convenience store (for a lottery ticket) and the laundromat to find a mark. There they run into a Little Old Lady (Grant) whom Angela quickly convinces to split the proceeds with because she's technically too young to gamble legally.

In case you're worried, Roy makes his daughter return the money. The next several chapters find Frank and Roy trying to finalize a currency conversion scam they've plotted against strip-club owner Chuck. Roy also discovers that having a daughter has made him more attractive to Kathy, the sexy supermarket checkout woman.

Crafty or not, when Roy rips Chuck off at the airport (using Angela as a distraction) things turn dicey. A dangerous chase through the parking garage ensues. Unfortunately, Angela was captured on CCTV in the bar; Roy also discovers her juvenile record after quizzing. Scared, Roy dumps Angela at her mother's.

Klein comes into play again when Roy suffers another harrying OCD attack, and he's run out of pills. Since Klein is out of the office on weekends, Roy makes a mad dash to the DeSoto Pharmacy looking for Prefex tablets. The altercation with the pharmacists is one pinnacle of this DVD.

Most of the cons pulled by Roy are safe, but after he's scammed Chuck out of $[...], Chuck turns up in Roy's tidy living room with a pistol pointed at Angela and Roy, and a bloodied, beaten Frank in tow. When a gun goes off, it's unbelievable who pulls the trigger.

Essentially what happens next is that Chuck gets shot -- by Angela. Roy protects her by putting her in a car headed to her mother's, driven by Frank, with instructions for Frank to never return, because he intends to drive Chuck to the hospital and take the rap for the shooting.

Now that you've heard about this heartwarming film with a wonderfully human twist ending, I hope you buy, rent or seek it out. Matchstick Men has proved to be one of Cage's more underappreciated efforts -- that's unfair since the emotion and the storytelling were so obviously clear.

1968366,4,B00012QLB4,"""Matchstick Men"" may not have been a box office success (compare it to the total gross of ""National Treasure"" [Cage's next film] and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" [Scott's next film]), but it certainly is one of the better-crafted & better-acted films to be associated with either of these men.  I was beginning to wonder if Cage could ever repeat a performance like what he did in ""Leaving Las Vegas.""  While his obsessive-compulsive con-man may not be the disaster along the lines of a suicidal alcoholic, he comes close with the impact he makes on the viewer.  This could easily have veered into caricature, but Cage creates a creditable & believable obsessive-compulsive.

Perhaps this could be classified as a comedy, but it has an awfully bittersweet quality to it which makes the movie difficult to categorize with any ease.  The characters of Roy & Angela (a very very good performance by Alison Lohman, who is entirely believable as a 14-year-old) are real enough to cause the viewer to have a vested interest in their ultimate fate, as the movie takes numerous twists & turns.

Ridley Scott did quite a good job at crafting a movie that avoids being too obvious, and which flows along nicely, maintaining viewer interest throughout.  This was a very satisfying film, through & through...I wish these two guys could make more like this.",1170979200,17,1335,4.906666666666666
1968367,1,B00012QLB4,"MATCHSTICK MEN, released in 2003, has star Nicolas Cage as one of
its only big-name actors, obviously bringing credibility, financial
support, and leadership to the project. And his acting is standard
fare, for what we've come to expect from Cage, solid acting, and a
full day's pay  for an honest day's work.

At the same time, several conclusions can be drawn from this movie.
The first, is that it severely lacks intensity in terms of the
story, and much of the supporting acting. Secondly, it is filmed,
and the story unfolds, much like in  a low budget TV production,
despite some quality filming elements, from time to time. Third,
that creating, writing a script, and filming it, takes a lot of hard
work, and rare talent, and only a small percentage of pictures
actually are successful and leave an impression of average to high
quality; it's tough work, and the effort must not be underestimated.
What occurs with MATCHSTICK MEN, is that the entire movie is a mess
from the story point of view, and from a spectator's view too.

Other elements, than those mentioned, are perhaps more subjective,
and I won't hold it against the makers, such as weaving a grown-man
and child relationship, into a story featuring a small time grifter,
played by Cage, who himself, doesn't really come across, in terms of
personality, as one, as compared to, perhaps, other movies. I think
the child-grown man relation was an absurd invention.

Another absurd device, used in this movie, is that it seems to
literally serve  an advertisement for psychotherapy, for Pfizer and
other pharmaceutical companies, considering the emphasis of this
movie on the leading perpetrator taking pills throughout the 90
mins.

Another unnecessary element, was soliciting sympathy for the main
grifter, on account of his own personal emotional demons, and
physical illnesses, and his need to take medication constantly, for
psychological remorse on his activities.

All these elements, combined with a confused story, add up as a
wreck in terms of a movie, despite all the best, hard work and best
intentions, from Cage and other actors, in trying to make this
project appealing. The script simply had too many flaws, and the
filming too much TV-like, and the actors, lacking intensity,
throughout. Not a keeper, by any means.",1170547200,5,2299,5.0

1968369,5,B00012QLB4,"`Matchstick Men' is one of those movies that makes you realize why some actors have support.  Up until watching this film I had been a `Cage-Hater', a guy who just couldn't wrap his head around all the critical support (granted, I saw this movie before watching `Adaptation' and since watching that film I've realized this man `can' act, he just chooses not to half the time).  Here though Nicolas Cage gave me a brief glimpse of the man that everyone else sees.  As con-artist Roy Waller, Cage gives us a brilliant performance.

My main problem with Cage has been his stiff natured acting, the fact that every time he speaks it feels as if he's reading a prompter card, and so I think that the fact that his character here suffers from a severe case of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) helps a lot in that regard since he's supposed to sound stiff and unnatural.

Roy works with fellow con Frank (Sam Rockwell), the young hotshot protg who has higher ambitions than Roy himself, and this is causing them to butt-heads a bit.  The real drama though comes in the form of Angela (Alison Lohman), a young 14-year old who claims to be his daughter.  At first Roy's put off and distant, but after Angela shows major interest in her fathers line of `work' they begin to bond by pulling small con-jobs together.  Meanwhile Frank is getting more and more agitated with the new bond between father and daughter because it's causing a strain on a big job they have coming up.

Filled with twists and turns and an ending I never saw coming, `Matchstick Men' is the perfect kind of caper.  It's got great acting from a cast I never knew had it in them and a great moral message that manifests itself as the film unravels.  Alison Lohman is charming and natural and Sam Rockwell is the perfect side-kick, but the real shocker (at least to me) was the mere fact that Nicolas Cage steals the show from everyone!",1166486400,12,1899,4.555882352941176

1968376,5,B00012QLB4,"This film is special to me because I have a very stressful life and it's rare for me to find a film that makes me laugh a lot.  It does get very dramatic, but the twist plus the role of the priestly psychiatrist provide the serious and moral angle of the film.  Without the latter I would have turned off the film because I have contempt for the way such cons exploit elderly and trusting people.

However, one of the several mistakes I believe was how could the psychiatrist set up the initial meeting of the girl and Roy unless he was on Frank's side and that would blow to pieces his role as the voice of integrity.  Correct me, somebody, if I'm wrong about that.  (Plus why would a girl living in Woodland Hills go to Venice High--they're a LONG bumper-to-bumper drive over the Hollywood Hills from the Valley to the Santa Monica area!)

Even better to me than the story were the VERY cool details--many of the shots were so snazzy and the lighting provided by the flickering lights off the pool remind me of a David Hockney painting.  I was very impressed that they made the effort to include that.  Better than those was the swinging retro music of the mid-60s.  I was about to buy the soundtrack until I noticed it left out the formally corny but now swank Wayne Newton song ""Danke Schoen"" played while Roy is shaking a martini. (So I downloaded the songs individually.) Loved the shots of the LP playing Herb Alpert...brought back memories of my childhood.  It has some nice Sinatra songs too.

Roy's house is really neat too--in more ways than one.  It has some of the coolest stuff of the mid 60s without going overboard.

Why didn't they add that retro touch to Roy's non-descript modern car!  What would you say it should have been?  A Dodge Dart?  Lincoln?  Hmmm...I say a Chrysler Imperial--though I don't know how he'd manage the high speed, tight garage chase scenes (Cage does his own, BTW) in a land yacht.

Who else but Nicholas Cage could play that role?

Nowadays it's just not nice to laugh at people with problems they can't help, but the filmmakers found the last niche, I guess, in a guy with tics.  Sorry, tic sufferers, but it was really funny when Roy went ""off"" his meds and his tics got way out of control--how wild when he was shouting in that gut level debate with his shrink (""Look at me, I'm a mess!"") and between his repeating tics he'd howl involuntarily ""whooooo!""

1968378,4,B00012QLB4,"Once again, Nicolas Cage demonstrates that he is not only one of the most versatile actors working today, but one of the best in Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"".  Cage gives a master class in acting with his portrayal of Roy, a small-time L.A. con man with no life outside his 'work', and some Issues with a capital 'I'.  Roy suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which manifests itself in a fetish for cleanliness and various repetitive actions and physical twitches and tics.  Roy feels safest indoors, and when he's at home, gives free reign to all his idiosyncratic behaviors.  On the job, he's managed to master his condition well enough to build a very successful 'business', complete with his own junior partner (Sam Rockwell).  Roy's micro-managed life is thrown a curveball in the form of a 14-year-old girl named Angela (a dazzling turn by Alison Lohman of 'White Oleander', convincing as a young teen even though she was 22 at the time) . . .the daughter Roy has never met, since he split with her mom before Angela was born.  The burgeoning relationship between Roy and Angela forces Roy to confront the the moral dilemmas posed by his profession that are the true cause of his illness.  There's a lot of entertaining caper business along the way, but this father-daughter relationship is the heart of the film.  Cage embodies Roy with a decency and humanity that makes him likeable despite the bad things he does for a living.  In lesser hands, Roy's mannerisms might have overshadowed the character and pushed him into parody, but Cage applies them with restraint & consistency so that we get the feeling that inside and out, he IS Roy, as a man with this condition might actually exist.  When he pulls out all the stops to show Roy in the throes of a major meltdown, it's humorous, and yet shows the pathos of OCD in a way that wouldn't be possible if he were over the top all the time.

Shot on location around Los Angeles, the movie has a breezy, upbeat feel that is purposely at odds with the darker events happening to Roy at the center.  The irony of a character who is afraid to go outside, staying inside behind closed blinds, when outside L.A. is glaringly bright and spacious highlights the loneliness of Roy's inner world.  The retro soundtrack, infused with Sinatra and other Rat-Pack classics is also 'instrumental' in creating a sunny mood at odds with Roy's darker reality.  It's not really correct to classify this movie as a comedy; though there are humorous moments throughout, this is a complex, multilayered film that transcends mere comedy.  In this way, it is similar in tone and style to Stephen Spielberg's 'Catch Me if You Can'.  Almost as enjoyable as the film is the feature making-of documentary that follows director Ridley Scott & his stellar cast and crew through the year-long process of bringing 'Matchstick Men' to the screen.

Similarities to Paper Moon end with the Father - Daughter relationship.

This is the sort of movie that you can't really talk about without spoiling the surprises. In fact telling you it has surprises runs the risk of spoiling things..! However, I think that going into it knowing this is a heist/crime story in the vein of The Sting only prepares you for the type of fun this movie gives you.

I think that a trailer which accurately portrayed the movie would have given too much of the fun stuff away.

Nick Cage's portrayal of a man with so many personal demons that he has uncontrolled physical twitches doesn't resemble any real life malady, but he manages to make the quirks work in the context of this story.

It's funny and well written, pay attention or you'll miss some details and be left asking other people in the room, ""what happened."" It also manages to avoid glorifying crime too much.",1124236800,3,1234,4.646788990825688
1968381,5,B00012QLB4,"There aren't many movies out there which surprise me, and there are even fewer that have a plot. This scored in both ways.

Roy, the con man, has a partner and an obsessive compulsive disorder. The movie starts with a darkly humorous insight into a con, and we are shown in a series of short vignettes exactly what the problem is. The whole thing is skilfully done and a delight.

When Roy flushes his meds down the sink, he becomes a wreck; eventually, his partner comes and sorts him out, and hooks him up with a psychiatrist.

The psychiatrist persuades him to touch base with his ex wife, and he finds out about a daughter whom he had never met. Enter the daughter - of course. She wins his heart and turns out to be a girl after his own leanings.

There are so many little insights into the characters' psyches that this movie is a delight. Little details emerge about what each person likes, and the acting is wonderful and feel-good. Yet all is not as it seems, and the twists and bucks to the plot keep on coming right until the bittersweet end. If nothing else, it's a story about ""what goes around, comes around"" - but for once, I didn't see it coming, until the last minute.",1122854400,3,1185,4.372727272727273
1968382,4,B00012QLB4,"Matchstick Men is a story of one man by the name of Roy who is germophobic, is obsessive compulsive, and just happens to be a con man......

Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a man who is utterly brilliant when it comes to conning other people. However he considers himself to be a con ""Artist,"" that is, he doesn't take people's money by force. He also absolutely despises harsh language, instead of using any bad word he simply says, ""Oh Pygmies!""

He is also obsessive compulsive; his rituals include closing and opening doors three times in a row while saying the numbers out loud, and sometimes even in a different language. He lives on keeping his carpet clean, sometimes reminding people three or four times to always take off their shoes before they step on the carpet.

Roy's world is turned upside down when he realizes that his ex wife's 14 year old daughter [Allison Lohman] heard about him trying to talk to her mother and wants to meet him. In the few awkward moments that he meets his daughter, Roy feels drawn to her, in a sort of protective father figure.

I found that the relationship with Roy and Angela, his daughter, was very heartwarming, and genuine. A father trying to make up for 14 years of not growing up with her, and a girl who is curious about her father's past and what he does, and also acts as a rebellious child. [But all teens act like that]

It doesn't take long for Roy to start taking Angela on some of his cons to teach her after being pressured into it by her to begin with. One very good scene involves an old lottery ticket that won 600 bucks, only to have a woman give 300 to Angela for finding the ticket. But Roy's responsible parent comes into play and makes Angela give the money back.

This is a great movie, one of the best of Nicholas Cage's career. His portrayal as a man who is desperate to be a father and to make his life simple is brilliant. The big twist at the end, which you can see clearly the second time you watch this movie, is done brilliantly as well.

In this movie, Cage enters what turns out to be a ""long con"" in which the con man is taken for a ride.

The intellectual pleasures of this movie are high, not only in figuring out the con but also the sessions of required talk in the shrink's office.

But this is an America which dares not spend time on the couch and which prefers a comforting, multi-level marketed scam to the brutal truth, both personally and politically. With the Fascist convergence of business and government we see the emergence of a long con in the ""reform"" of Social Security.

Of course, the message is ambiguous. It could very well be that it's good to feel emotions which later turn out not to have content (see above warning concerning spoilers). The lottery ticket holder gets a buzz, doesn't he, from quantum possibility.

For the same reason, the populace as a whole gets a buzz, don't they, from allowing WMD and Social Security pigeon drops to occur.

The content of a quick smoke by the loading dock is actually damage, so the buzz is at variance with the content. Emotions, like Cage's in the movie, are dulled because the buzz is activated too often in a false alarm.

But this is also to insist that it's hopeless to dream of a real daughter personally, or a meaningful election politically. Buzz becomes an ersatz for reality.

Which is to speculate that objectively, any Hollywood apparatus will increasingly virtualize emotion and cynically deprive it of content so that the disempowered audience will itself be conned into norming its responses to an unbearable reality.

These types of film show the protagonist's messy life.  The revelation that your existence has hit a wall is usually catalyzed by an unusual event, for an example, Cage's 14 year-old daughter he has never seen has suddenly arrived in the midst of con-man shenanigans.  All hell breaks lose during a caper, and retro father-Cage has to make some mature decisions.

The frenetic and ultra-talented Sam Rockwell as Roy's partner/sidekick con-man Frank is certainly one to watch; his character here is ambitious, and one fault of the film (or perhaps just the short-sighted nature of its ""hero"" Roy) is that Roy places too much trust in Frank. Being con-men, who lie, cheat and steal for a living, I find it hard to believe that Roy would treat Frank as openly as he does, and see him as so innocuous.

It could've been great; with Ridley Scott (!!!) directing and Nicolas Cage, Same Rockwell, and Alison Lohman starring in a film about the always-entertaining topic of crime, ""What could possibly go wrong?"" I thought.  A lot.

Ridley Scott is an amazing director, yes; he directed my favorite movie of all time, ""Gladiator"".  However, when it comes to movies about humans plus a relatively wordy script, minus high-voltage special effects and sets, Scott seems absolutely at a loss.  His clumsy, impersonal direction never lets us truly identify with the characters or their plight.  And maybe that's not such a bad thing since these flimsy, paper-thin characters adapted from Eric Garcia's novel by Nicholas and Ted Griffin are hardly worth getting to know.

It is through no fault of the actors, though.  Cage, who is, for me, the sole reason to watch this movie, is delightful, funny, and charming as an obsessive-compulsive con man whose relentless housecleaning is put to a rest only by his reunion with his long-lost teenage daughter (Lohman).  I really enjoyed watching Cage throw himself into this role and truly become his character.  Cage provides ""Matchstick Men"" with some much-needed humor and a bit of spark that is surprisingly lacking for a Scott-directed crime-caper that, in the end, commits the ultimate crime of being boring.",1102723200,2,1419,5.157205240174672

It's unlike Ridley Scott to make a dramatic comedy, and although I liked movies like Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, this was my favorite movie that he made. It's about con artists, although I wouldn't describe it as a crime movie. If I had to make a list of my favorite movies, this would be at the top.

 To begin with, the acting is amazing in this movie. Nicolas Cage plays Roy, and he is one of the very gifted actors of our time. In this movie, he's able to be dignified and calm at some points, while at others he's totally wild with this ticks and obsessive compulsive disorder. Sam Rockwell plays Roy's partner Frank, and he also gives a great performance, as the more easygoing of the two con men. Alison Lohman is very convincing and good as Roy's daughter. When I was first going to see the movie, I hadn't even heard of her, but she was extremely well acting. It turns out that she's in her twenties, although she doesn't look it.

 It's very skillfully photographed, as the scenes in Roy's dark house where the pool light shining in on the room creates a blue, rippling light on the walls that looks really good. Ridley Scott directs it very well, and he really gets you to be interested in the movie.

 It's a great story. The different cons were a lot of fun, where you were always wondering how they would pull them off. And the ending was one of the best endings that I have ever seen in a movie. Some people didn't like the ""one year later"" thing, but I thought it added a little bit more to the plot and character developement, therefore making the movie better.

1968403,3,B00012QLB4,"A film by Ridley Scott
With the track record of Ridley Scott in mind (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Thelma and Louise, Black Hawk Down), any time the man makes a new movie I am automatically interested in it.  He has a history of creativity and excellence in filmmaking and any new movie that he directs is worth giving a chance.  It was with high expectations that I went into ""Matchstick Men"", a story of a con-artist.
Roy (Nicolas Cage) and Frank (Sam Rockwell) are partners in the art of conning people out of their money.  As Roy explains in the film, he doesn't steal people's money, they give it to him.  They are mainly working small phone scams for smaller payouts (though Roy seems to be well off considering the size of his house), but Frank is looking to get a big score, which Roy agrees to work.  Simple enough, but Roy also has some serious issues.  He is compulsive (he must turn the locks or open and close doors three times before actually opening the door all the way), somewhat manic, and he has trouble dealing with the outdoors.  Neatness/cleanliness is another issue.  Roy is a man with tics.
Into this imperfect, but somewhat structured life comes a big change: Roy's daughter Angela (Alison Lohman).  When Roy accidentally knocks his supply of medication down the drain, Roy has to start searching for a psychologist who will prescribe some more on short notice.  The doctor he does find also suggests that Roy gets in contact with his daughter, whom he has never met.  Angela is a breath of fresh air into Roy's otherwise empty life, but it is also causing some conflict into the big con that Roy and Frank are working on.
My expectations may have been too high, because I wasn't overly impressed with ""Matchstick Men"".  For the first half to two thirds of the movie, I just could not engage with the characters.  Part of the problem probably lies in the fact that I do not care for Nicolas Cage as an actor.  It just seems like he is trying too hard to create a character through personality tics (with the notable exceptions of Leaving Las Vegas, and The Family Man).  His characters are just not likeable, or interesting enough for me to engage with, but I understand that this is just a personal perception.
The shining star of the movie is Alison Lohman (also in White Oleander) who was nearly 10 years older than the age she was playing in the movie.  She can act and look so young and vulnerable despite being in her mid 20's.  The rest of the acting was well done (though I still don't care for Cage), but it didn't all come together like I would have expected.  The idea of the ""con"" runs throughout the entire movie and there are several twists along the way, but this is a fairly lightweight movie up until about three quarters of the way through the movie when it completely changes in tone (and oddly enough becomes a better movie).  I hoped for so much more from ""Matchstick Men"", but I didn't think it lived up to the promise of what it could have been with the talent involved.

1968404,3,B00012QLB4,"Ridley Scott has directed several block buster films such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and Black Hawk Down (2002). Scott displays his talent for creating real characters in his films, which he refined in Thelma and Louise (1991). In Matchstick Men Scott pushes himself even further into the human psyche as the main character, Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage), is dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

The con-artist Roy Waller suffers from OCD as he goes about his daily business swindling innocent people with his partner Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). Accidentally Roy drops his medication in the sink and goes into a cleaning frenzy as his OCD begins to run amok. Frank begins to worry about Roy and connects him with a psychiatrist. Through therapy Roy improves and soon he finds out that he has a daughter from a previous marriage. Roy is forced to deal with his OCD as he is about to confront his 14-year-old daughter he has never seen, and simultaneously pulls off the biggest con of his life before early retirement.
The story of Matchstick Men has been told before, but here is retold with a new twist. The new twist circulates around the psychological disorder that Nicholas Cage presents through wonderful acting.

On Frank's advice, Roy visits a new shrink, Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman), to whom he admits a previous marriage abandoned some fourteen years previous when his wife was pregnant. Through Klein's intercession, Roy is put in touch with his teenage daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman), who's always been curious about Old Dad. Indeed, against her Mom's wishes, she appears on Roy's doorstep to spend a long weekend. Roy is alternatively smitten with paternal affection and acute anxiety over the dirt Angela tracks onto his carpet. Klein believes the girl's presence is good therapy.
MATCHSTICK MEN is about scammers and cons, so, by the time the credits roll, you shouldn't be too surprised at the general storyline, which is one oft seen before. What elevates the film is the intensity of Cage's extraordinary performance as the mentally tortured lead. We've watched Nicolas do this previously in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. Cage is apparently not one for whom a role is simply a facade easily sluiced away at the end of the day's shoot. Cage always makes me believe the screen character is himself through to the core, something which either makes the actor one of the most talented in the Biz or a schizo seriously in need of professional help.
The other remarkable performance in this film is that of Lohman. Playing the 14-year old Angela, one is apt to forget, or not believe, that the actress is actually in her mid-twenties. She had me fooled.
MATCHSTICK MEN is perhaps one you'll want to see a second time to locate the key sequence where you yourself were fooled. This is first-rate entertainment.",1087171200,4,2236,4.886842105263158
1968408,4,B00012QLB4,"I've been a fan of Cage for quite a while.  His quirkiness and his portrayal of offbeat characters are intriguing.  He takes offbeat to a mesmerizing level in Matchstick Men.  He plays an obsessive compulsive conman so well, you're not sure whether to slap him or cradle him and say ""everything's gonna be all right.""  Regardless, he keeps you glued to the set, waiting to see if he'll snap out of his chain-smoking, eye-twitching, panic-attacking ways or hopelessly land himself in a padded white room.
The mood of the movie restlessly parallels Cage's character.  It's edgy and stays on a bite-your-nails course until the end.  A twist at the end left me shaking my head as if I hadn't seen it coming.  The unfolding plot, however, foreshadows some unknown turn, but I wasn't expecting that twist.
This is an entertaining movie and well done.",1086998400,,844,4.819444444444445
1968409,5,B00012QLB4,"Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller gives the most entertaining performance of a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder since Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"".  Cage is nearly paralyzed by his condition, in particular when he is out of his medication.  The early scenes establish his condition and his occupation as a con artist, and there is a steller sequence which begins when he clumsily dumps his medications into kitchen sink and commences a series of panicked phone calls to get refills after hours.  There are several hilarious scenes between Cage and Bruce Altman as Roy's Psychiatrist.
Sam Rockwell as Roy's con-man partner Frank Mercer gives another performance that signals his emergence as an American A-list actor. Alison Lohman is very appealing as the daughter Roy never met.
The first act of the film introduces these three characters and the second develops Roy's relationship with his daughter.
The third act builds around an elaborate con that the three of them have cooked up, and by the end of the film you see that the con worked exactly as one of them planned.  I don't plan to give any twists away but I will say expect some - twists that is.
Ridley Scott directs and adds another jewel to a resume that already sparkles with ""Alien"", ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Blackhawk Down"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Gladiator"".",1086739200,4,1340,4.942222222222222

I was pleasantly surprised by the rich characterization of Nicholas Cage's character, and the strong performances of all of the major performers.  There were some very subtle and very funny comedic bits in this film that would have fallen flat otherwise.
However, a con movie has to be smarter than you with regard to the con, and it can't give you too much time to figure it out.  Otherwise you're going to figure out the ending halfway into the movie.  Unfortunately, that's what happened to me with this film.  At two hours, it's about 20-30 minutes too long.  This extra length causes the film to drag in parts, which makes you start to think about the con in order to escape the boring bits, and then you have the ""aha!"" moment when you realize what's going to happen.  This problem is only amplified in home viewing, when everyone will feel free to start discussing the film during those slow parts.

1968412,4,B00012QLB4,"Director:  Ridley Scott
Cast:  Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell, Alison Lohman, Bruce Altman, Bruce McGill, Jenny O'Hara, Steve Eastin.
Running Time:  121 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for language and some violence.
Ridley Scott, director of a wide variety of motion pictures, ranging from ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"", and the Oscar-winning ""Gladiator"", creates an exciting, intelligent action-comedy that possesses a strong lead wrong from the obsessive-compulsive stricken con-artist played by Nicholas Cage.  Adapted from the novel written by Eric Garcia, ""Matchstick Men"" is a hidden gem that did not receive much critical consideration or buzz, but will undoubtedly make you laugh and think at the same time.
Roy (Cage) is a virtuoso con-man who is overwhelmed by his psychological disadvantages that consist of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder; he is very monetarily successful, but his problems have left him with no social acquaintances except his partner Frank (played by Sam Rockwell), a devastating divorce, and an increasing dependence on his psychologist (Bruce Altman).  Amidst planning for their biggest score against a wealthy, unsuspecting mark (Bruce McGill), Roy's world is thrown upside down when a young fourteen year-old girl (Alison Lohman) steps through the threshold of his frantic world and claims to be the daughter that he has never met.  Roy is torn between making the biggest score of his live or changing his ways and perspectives to focus more on his newfound relationship with the young woman.  Surprisingly to Roy, his daughter has an incredible knack for the dubious crimes that he and Frank are accustomed to committing-prompting Roy to include her in their con scheme.
Director Scott creates a hip, energetic film with similar undertones to his 1991 film ""Thelma and Louise"", using some excellent dialogue and twists and turns to create an intellectual comedic caper that sniffs similarities of ""The Sting"".  Nicholas Cage is very good in his role as the neurotic crook, but his engaging relationship with the stand-out Lohman makes the film very entertaining.  A film that will certainly stimulate the mind and the funny bone-well worth the trip.  The 72-minute ""Tricks of the Trade"" is produced by Ridley Scott and is a very informative and interactive feature on the DVD, allowing viewers to parade through a variety of options, including interview segments, deleted scenes and ego-massaging.  An especially pleasurable flick!",1086134400,,2483,5.456919060052219
1968413,4,B00012QLB4,"This stylish film is thoroughly entertaining with a minimum of violence.  Think ""Paper Moon"" meets ""The Grifters"" and ""What About Bob?""  Nick Cage is hysterical as a quirky con artist bedeviled by obsessive-compulsive disorder; the scenes of his closets alone were enough to make me smile.  The Frank Sinatra songs were presumably intended to impart a devil-may-care mood, and while they were consistent with the film's light touch, I believe a more eclectic and original soundtrack might have saved the story from feeling more than a tad derivative.  But overall the film was like enjoying a good pastry: it might not be terribly nutritious, but it sure goes down easily.",1085702400,,672,5.081818181818182
1968414,5,B00012QLB4,"People are saying TOO MUCH about this movie in their reviews.  Watching the film will be more enjoyable the less you hear about it before viewing.  But if you must read a review, here is mine (free of spoilers):
Matchstick Men is one of the safest films to recommend in years.  While many people won't love it, almost everyone will enjoy it.  It is often funny, sometimes charming and always interesting.  Nicolas Cage plays a conman.  Much like in The Sopranos, his life is sorted into three areas: criminal activity, family and therapy.
What makes this film different than most flim-flam films is that a film about Cage's character would be fascinating regardless of his profession.  He is obsessive compulsive, neurotic, depressed, unstable, etc.  Cage has the misfortune of following Jack Nicholson's turn as a similarly afflicted person in As Good As it Gets.  In his turn, Cage is no less convincing and brings a degree of humanity to the character that was missing from Jack's abrasive writer.
I won't speak much about the plot of the film, but will only say his three worlds (job, family, therapy) constantly intersect and come together in a very satisfying ending.  The film has the look of a nice Armani  suit and is often accompanied by the smooth sounds of Sinatra.  Not to be missed is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance by Sam Rockwell as Cage`s understudy.
Also featured on the DVD is a great commentary track by director Ridley Scott and writer Nicolas Griffin.  It is one of the most honest and forthcoming tracks I have ever heard.  They really do a fine job explaining the nuances of the script and give away a lot of reasons for decisions they made that many other artists would have kept secret.",1085184000,,1720,4.766891891891892

Sam Rockwell(Glory Daze) playing Frank is a standout and Alison Lohman(White Oleander) is cute as Cage's ""daughter"". The twist at the end I didn't see coming but it was fun to say the least. Cage gives us another performance to his list and a memorable one to say the least. Also starring Bruce McGill(Animal House). Probably one of the best of 2003",1084233600,,579,4.858585858585859

As always, realism is always an issue with these types of motion pictures, but I can dig those ""twists"" that seem to get dished out more and more from the movie makers.

1968417,2,B00012QLB4,"Ridley scott is a brilliant director and Nicholas Cage has a firm grasp on the art of acting. Unfortunately even all that skill and heart can't save Matchstick Men. First of all it about conmen, so right from the get go its oh ready riddled with cliches. Cage plays a conman who finds his heart after he realizes he has a daughter, so he has an epiphany. Despite the contrived plot Cage brings real charisma to the role, picking up where he left off with Adaptation. The movie sucks but Cage makes it worth seeing.",1083024000,3,514,4.421052631578948
1968418,5,B00012QLB4,"One of Nicholas Cage's best performances, this oddly titled movie with an unattractive premise surprises and delights.
Nicholas Cage plays a middle-aged conman who just happens to be neurotic, and while at first glance this appears a rather boring premise, the film itself is well-written, directed, and acted.
While it seems at first that this movie is about a con job, the attentive viewer quickly understands what it's really about: Roy, the main character of this tale.  So while this movie does tell the story of a con job, in the end, that's just a tale within a tale.
There's depth here, and despite an ""art film"" appearance, this is actually a touching and powerful story.  I'm carefully choosing my words throughout this review so as not to give away what happens, but suffice to say, by the end, I was in turn laughing, sitting in stunned silence, and grinning from ear to ear.
If ""Matchstick Men"" has any flaw, it's the artsy surface.  It adds flavor, but it also adds distance.  The story is so well told that this distance is traversed excellently by the time you reach the perfect ending, however, and the overall sacrifice (keeping us a little detached in favor of making the film feel unique and decidedly uncommercial) is, in my opinion, worthwhile.  And as much distance as the art film appearance gives, the effect is most profound only at the beginning of the movie, and the power of the story thoroughly takes over by the end.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a film with depth, feeling, and a unique appearance.  If you're looking for a commercial, typical Hollywood-style con movie, this may not be the film for you--but even then, if you brave out the first half hour, you'll find yourself surprised and pleased by the time you reach the end.  Five of five stars.",1082678400,3,1806,4.714285714285714
1968419,4,B00012QLB4,"Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"" is an extremely clever film with unexpected twists and a wonderful performance by Nicholas Cage which compensates for some of the holes in the plot.
Roy Waller, our hero, played by Cage, is riddled with neuroses. He is a recovering alcoholic, agoraphobic chainsmoker, somewhat disabled by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and panic attacks, which cause repetitive behavior and a multitude of ticks, especially when he fails to take his medication. He is also a successful grifter, a gifted and innovative con man. ""Matchstick Man"" is slang for con artist. His partner and protege, Frank Mercer, (Sam Rockwell), cares for Roy almost like a brother. The two share a close friendship and a long association. Frank wants his mentor to pull himself together so they can conduct a major scam and make some big bucks. Frank persuades Roy to see a psychiatrist, (Bruce Altman), who wants him to confront his past and encourages him to get to know the daughter he has never met. Enter adorable adolescent daughter Angela, (Alison Lohman), who lives with Roy's ex-wife and charms her newly found dad to open himself up to the first meaningful emotional attachment he may have ever had. She begins to upset his obsessively controlled, organized world. Angela, awed by her father's chosen profession, surprisingly persuades him to give her a shot at being a con-child. She's quite good at it too - a regular chip off the old block.
While father-daughter relationship is developing, Frank is putting together the scam of a lifetime with an easy, very wealthy mark. Roy, with newly found parental scruples, has qualms about pulling it off. This is where the action really begins and the plot twists and turns, so I won't continue as I don't want to spoil the film for potential viewers.
Except for some terrific acting, this is not a major film but it is good entertainment. Filled with dark humor, the movie is funny at times, sometimes moving, with a few real surprises. The plot has its predictable moments and Angela's character gets tiresome as she continually gets her way through repetitive childish tantrums, whining and pouting. The Frank Sinatra soundtrack wonderfully sets a 1950s milieu. There's an awful epilogue that Director Scott should have excluded. I do recommend seeing this because there are many more good moments than bad ones - and watching Nicholas Cage is well worth the price of admission or rental. ENJOY!

1968422,3,B00012QLB4,"Had the Matchstick Men had a more plausible script it would've been simply great. Problem is, it doesn't have it.
This is a theme explored several times in the past in film (most notably ""The Sting"", ""Thieves"" and the brilliant ""House of games"") and it's one that always provides an exciting vehicle for a director and scriptwriter as it portrays the small scale intelligence wars going on every day in our societies.
  In ""Matchstick Men"", N.Cage and his partner have a nice lil scheme going on, mostly ripping off people through telephone sale scams (but not only), a scheme that works like a dandy mostly because the 2 con artists are at the top of their game after years of practice and because of some well nurtured talent they both possess in acting out their bogus schemes.
  Cage is a show in its own to watch as he plays a character who's extremely obsessive/compulsive and who's got a massive repertoire of facial ticks to burden him as well. It's a return to good performances for Cage who has appeared in a few not too memorable flicks recently, but here he simply shines.
  The plot follows these 2 as they pull off their frauds, until things take a very twisty turn. What that is i'd rather not describe since it would totally spoil the film for those who haven't seen it (much like describing the catch of the ""Usual suspects"") but the problem lies exactly in that twist.
  In order for the film to have been flawless it was essential that its twist is believable, well thought-out and carefully presented. Instead, the catch of the film has many flaws, or rather premises which are seriously stretched and which recquire from you to ignore their inplausibility in order for the film to ""do it"" for you. I, for one, could't ignore those stretches and thus it was a mixed affair for me, but even so, ""Matchstick Men"" still remains a very good film.
  Aside from Cage's often hilarious but tragic as well character, the rest of the characters have a distinct second seat to him, but this is a film set for an one-man show and that what it essentially is. The directing, as expected from someone in Riddley Scott's caliber, is great and the overall pace doesn't let down as it keeps you watching knowing that something is building up.
  It's a pity really for the scriptwritting shortcomings because there was potential for a truly great film here. For those who like films of this line i recommend the ""House of Games"" from the end of the 80s..",1081123200,,2457,4.5972540045766594
1968423,4,B00012QLB4,"Nicolas Cage has always been a fun actor to watch, and he plays his role here as the obsessive compulsive con artist brilliantly.  The movie is truly one that surprised me with the ending, but also contained ultimately a solid set of values.
The movie picks up with Cage going through his strange routines while his partner and he cook up scams to bilk unsuspecting people out of money.  Cage has the presence and the acting skill to literally make you nervous and edgy while watching his neurotic habits and behavior play themselves out.  After being on his own so long he reconnects with his long lost daughter, and his life begins to be pushed upside down as his carefully crafted routines are sidelined by this free spirited teen-ager suddenly thrust into his life.
The sets and designs seem to be timeless and have almost a ""60's"" sort of feel to them, with the music fitting more cleanly into that era than present day Los Angeles.  There is definitely a mood to this film that harkens back to the ""rat pack"" era, with an emphasis on style and a smooth flow.  This is a welcome relief from the often loud and jarring soundtracks and cinematography of many of today's films.
I don't want to spoil the rest of the plot, as you really should see this and enjoy the ride yourself, but will say that the film left me feeling satisfied and happy for the way it all turns out.

While the ""con"" type movie is done over and over, this movie really isn't so much about action and pulling off a con, like say ""The Italian Job"" a fun movie in it's own right, but rather a movie about a person with a mental disorder that works as a con for a living and isn't really connected to the human race.  Enter a girl.  It's always a girl, isn't it?
I won't give away any surprises here, but I will say I didn't predict the ending to the movie and was very entertained by the whole thing.

I've never really been a huge fan of Nicholas Cage but one cannot deny his versatility as an actor as he brings forth his extremely neurotic character in this film.  Performance wise, Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell and newcomer Alison Lohman all deserve high praise for their individual and collective efforts in this film.
Director Ridley Scott, best known for many great films such as ""Alien,"" ""Gladiator"" and a whole horde of other outstanding films steps in to direct this film and once again his talents as a skillful director shine as he takes us through the somewhat convoluted script, never revealing too much until the right time.  He deserves a great amount of credit for the success of this film.
The Premise:
Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) is an extremely successful con man who has the home and the money to prove it however, he's also an extremely neurotic individual that had an unsuccessful relationship over fifteen years ago and hasn't attempted one since.  He suddenly finds that he needs to get some new anti depressants but now he has to go to a new doctor to get them and this psychologists actually wants him to talk about his problems which leads to him having a ""daughter.""  In comes Angela (Alison Lohman), his ""daughter"" and now he's a parent.
What follows from there is a fairly entertaining film as we're treated to Nicholas Cage at his finest in portraying a lonely, neurotic man who suddenly has a daughter and still has his life as a con man to contend with...
I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who enjoy a good con/comedy that will have you guessing the direction of the film all the way to its conclusion.  {ssintrepid}

1968426,4,B00012QLB4,"A few weeks ago I saw this movie and I wasn't expecting much.  As a matter of fact I was expecting a dud because in my opinion I think Nicholas Cage's career has been on the downturn with some of his latest movies.  I was suprised with Matchstick Men, it was very enjoyable from beginning to the extremely suprising end.  It is a humorous movie that is also a smart and slick con movie as well.
Nicholas Cage and his partner Sam Rockwell make a living off of being con artists.  They are quite successful at their line of work.  The two of them make a great team and they have great chemistry.  Cage's character also has obsessive compulsive disorder and he is always cleaning stuff.  He can't really function without his meds. and that plays a role in this movie as well.  Part way through the movie Cage's character finds out he has a teenage daughter he had about 15 years ago.  To cut things short.  They reunite, shes happy, they argue, she thinks he's a bad father, he tells her he makes a living is a con artist, shes intrigued and wants to become a con artist as well.  I will leave the rest to you to find out what else happens in this suprising and twisting movie.
I like some of Ridley Scotts movies but this one really stands out in my opinion.  I enjoyed movies he made like Alien & Gladiator but Matchstick Men is another great movie that when you think Ridley Scott hopefully this movie will come to thought as well.  There are alot of con movies come out every year but Matchstick Men stands out in that crowd.  If you enjoyed other recent movies like Confidence or Oceans Eleven you are going to love this movie.
With all honesty I mean it when I say Matchstick Men is one of last years best movies. It combines humor, a bit of action, and plot twists along the way.  Give this movie a try if you like Nicolas Cage in what I think is one of his best roles and movies he's played since Leaving Las Vegas.",1080259200,,1920,4.265193370165746

Cage stars as Roy, a guy with a serious amount of nervous ticks and obsessive compulsive behaviors. He can never calm down-- it's like he's got caffeine for blood, which makes him a really fun character to be around for the couple hours the movie is. Roy is a con artist, pulling a big job with his partner Mark (Sam Rockwell-- who is absolutely amazing). Mark is annoyed that Roy can't even calm down when they're in the middle of a job so he tells Roy to see a shrink. Roy then learns he has a fourteen year old daughter, played by the magnificnet Allison Lohman. She's emotional, she smells like bubble gum, and she's in the way of Roy's life as a con artist.
The ending really is too good for words. It surprised the heck out of me, that's for sure. I never saw it coming. There's certainly a sadness to it, but it works so well I can't hardly complain.
Truly, this movie is worth watching. Cage playing a guy with so many ticks is irresistably funny, a tad annoying, and kind of sad all at the same time. This movie not only boasts alot of talent from it's actors, but an endearing story with an unexpected ending.

1968433,3,B00012QLB4,"I bought Matchstick Men without having read the book, but I saw positive reviews, had seen and liked the trailer, and of course, knew that Ridley Scott directed. Well, I have to say, I was really engrossed for most of the film, but then the movie takes a turn that felt weird, and at the end I wished I had not seen it alone, so that I could instantly seek another viewer's opinion. I admit that I had trouble with the twists, because I think this movie works well without them, so to me they only got in the way. And unfortunately for you, it's difficult for me to point out the film's shortcomings (due to these twists) without revealing too much; so bare with me as skate the thin ice.
The back of the DVD case explains this movie fairly accurately, and the movie's concept of slick con artist Roy (Nicholas Cage) and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell), Roy's ticks and phobias, his discovering his long-lost daughter Angela (Alison Lohman), the subsequent complexity of Roy realising he is a father, should already make for interesting viewing for 116 minutes, wouldn't you say? So why add these twists?? Even the film's writer (see DVD extras) admits to having been annoyed by the book the movie is adapted from, and says his first draft re-write was a version with no twist, because he felt it was more satisfying to the reader/viewer. Sadly, his draft did not make the cut. At least I was not alone in my frustration.
Most movies can be divided into 3 acts. And these movies often thrive in the first two, but struggle in the third act. Matchstick Men on the other hand has 4 acts. The first three here are strong, and are played straight, meaning that you are never given any hints or clues suggesting a potential twist (though, again, these scenes with clues did exist, but were cut from the film). At 90 minutes in - which is about the time when most movies are either already over or wrapping things up - we are presented with a new idea - this twist - but at this stage, we as an audience, have already invested so much into the characters, it's hard to willingly see them in a totally different light.
Let me also say, that it's never very clear as to what genre movie Matchstick Men wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a character study? Is it a drama? In fact, you can't even look to the film-makers for answers, because not even they can agree on the style of film they were aiming for. Again, this all comes out in the excellent extras. You can really count on getting great honest insight in the DVD extras of a Ridley Scott film. And check out the commentary with Scott, and the two writers (Nicholas & Ted Griffin). Once you hear Scott's commentary, soooo much of the confusion and anger towards the 4th act goes away, and you suddenly learn to appreciate the film more. Enough to almost warrant 4 stars again. But to me, the movie has to get me the first time through. And that's why I just can't rate it higher. The acting is all-around really good, especially up-and-comer Alison Lohman. The music is by 7-time Ridley Scott collaborator Hans Zimmer, and I even had issues with the score, but that too is addressed in the special features section.
Don't think that I didn't like this film because of the 3 star rating. I just feel that this movie wimped out by thinking it had to do a 360 to keep my interest. It's true that it works best at repeat viewings, and all the actors are great too, I just think it's strange that the overall enjoyment of the film requires the understanding of the back story that only the director himself provides in the DVD commentary. It's a plus point for the DVD, but not for someone who saw it at the cinema or plans to rent it for a quick thrill.",1078963200,3,3700,4.395043731778426
1968434,3,B00012QLB4,"Roy (Nicholas Cage) is an obsessive-compulsive con man who functions remarkably well when he's bilking victims out of their hard-earned cash, but is a complete wreck in his personal life. Frank (Sam Rockwell) is Roy's partner and protg in a complicated phone scam business. Desperate for medication, Roy visits a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) who encourages him to seek out the child he never knew from his previous marriage. But Roy finds that he's gotten more than he bargained for when his long lost 14-year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman) disrupts his ordered life just as Roy is in the middle of a delicate and very lucrative con.

""Matchstick Men"" was adapted for the screen by Nicholas and Ted Griffin from the novel of the same name by Eric Garcia. Ridley Scott, in a departure from his usual action fare, directs this idiosyncratic ""dramedy"". The cast is all superb. Nobody does nervous ticks like Nicholas Cage, even though I'm tired of seeing him do them. Part of the trouble with this film comes from some confusion in its tone: It might have been a brooding character study, but director Scott wanted it to be a black comedy. Good call, but the film isn't funny enough to captivate the audience on that level. It doesn't impress as a character study because all of the characters are annoying. That's played for laughs, but doesn't consistently succeed because the film is just so self-absorbed. Black comedy or character study aside -which is where you will find them- ""Matchstick Men"" is a Grift Movie. And the grift works. It's a good one, and this is where ""Matchstick Men"" is successful. This is a good-looking film; I like the cinematography and production design. The performances are impressive. But it's a little rough to sit through (The second half is better than the first, so don't give up too soon). It just doesn't come across as it should. I recommend ""Matchstick Men"" to fans of grift movies and fans of Nic Cage, but I don't think its successes are going to outweigh the tedium for anyone else.

The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary entitled ""Tricks of the Trade"", an audio commentary by director Ridley Scott, screenwriter Nicholas Griffin, and  screenwriter/producer Ted Griffin, and  a theatrical trailer. ""Tricks of the Trade"" has three parts: pre-production, production, and post-production, and includes interviews with Ridley  Scott, the film's casting director, writers, producers, author Eric Garcia, and Hans Zimmer, who composed the film's score. It follows the making of ""Matchstick Men"", step-by-step, through all stages of production, which is plodding and tedious, but it gives a realistic picture of the movie-making experience instead of concentrating on eventful highlights. I think the documentary will bore most viewers, but film students might find it educational. The audio commentary is good but a little awkward, because Ridley Scott and the Griffin brothers seem to have taped their contributions at different times. They talk about the genesis of the film and storytelling decisions that were made along the way, but not technical stuff. Ridley Scott's contributions are especially interesting. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish, and dubbing is available in French.",1078876800,3,3266,5.166351606805293
1968435,3,B00012QLB4,"Shot in a stylish bluish tint that's starting to become less stylish to me, ""MM"" follows the exploits of a neurotic con man (""Con Arteest"" Roy would correct me). Smooth on the job, Roy (Cage) is driving himself crazy with twitches and odd habits. At first these eccentricities amuse, but after a while become somewhat as annoying to the audience as they are to him.
Though humorous and quirky at times, the film is lie-laden. And while it may be fun in an empty way to watch Cage, the film loses might whenever Rockwell is off screen. At the end of the day the production sports quality direction, acting, and dialogue; but you may not want to spend your evening watching a handful of lost souls lie to each other. A similar film, ""Catch Me if You Can"" at least offers some truly warm characters in the mix. (I'm telling you Christopher Walken's performance in that movie rocks!)
Btw, though not everybody will, some will find MM's ending rather predictable as I did. Additionally besides a matchbox few of implausibles, you also might not expect a super-clean, take-off-your-shoes-on-my-carpet, kind of guy to also chain smoke.",1078876800,,1128,4.78974358974359
1968436,3,B00012QLB4,"Before watching this movie I heard that a guy named Ridley Scott directed this movie.  I usually don't care who a director is for a movie but I thought it was interesting that this guy was also the director for flicks like Gladiator and Black Hawk Down.  When I heard this I thought, man this should be a good movie.  I has sorta right.  Matchstick Man tells a good storyline but the story doesn't hold my interest all the way through the movie and of course a plot twist at the end sorta ruined it. Nicholas Cage is Roy who is a con-artist that has many personal problems.  He can't stand outdoors and can't stand unorganized and dirty rooms as he makes people take off their shoes before entering his house.  He constantly has trouble keeping with the pills that deal with his personal problems.  One day Roy speaks with a doctor about getting another prescription of pills. His original doctor was on vacation so he saw a substitute.  As he was talking with his personal life he discovers that he has a daughter named Angela with his ex-girlfriend Heather.  Roy is now put in a serious bind as not only is he about to set his biggest score, he is now having to take responsibilities as a father and try to keep her from getting involved in his work.  Of course his daughter isn't what you call a saint.  She smokes like he does, drinks, and has been arrested for shoplifting despite being a minor.  When she find out what he did for a living, she was impressed and does encourage her father to teach her a few things.  She does end up involved in her dad's next con with his partner Frank.  Of course, the con didn't go as planned as the guy they screwed was hot in pursuit of Roy.  The guy even showed up at his house with Frank being helded hostage and in demand with at least half the cut that he owed.  His daughter end up accidentlly killing the guy in attempt to defend her father.  Now all three of their lives are in jeopardy, but Angela is the only one that Roy is really concerned about.  He has frank drive off with her far away and try to hook up on a later day.  However, Roy talks to Heather and discovers that when she was pregnant, she had a miscarriage.  Roy was hurt and felt betrayed but as he promised Angela during the movie, he does give up cons and works at a furniture store where he mets Angela one year later.  Even though he was disappointed with being set up, they do reconcile their differences. Nicholas Cage and the girl who played Angela were the only saving graces of this movie.  They worked well together.  The movie had a great story but it was hard to stay focused throughout the whole movie as they showed too many scenes of him looking for his medication and making trips to the drug store which I thought was a little unnecessary.  It is at least worthy of a rental, then you can draw your own conclusions.",1078790400,,2849,4.322033898305085
1968437,2,B00012QLB4,"If he had a daughter he would have been paying some type of child support throughout the years.  If he were beginning to see his daughter again he would have made an attempt to see her mother to discuss the matter.  If the prescription were as important to him as it was, he would have looked it up to verify what it was so he could try to purchase it illegally.
Here was a man who was organized and anal retentive, yet the environment surrounding the con was disjointed and not characteristic of his personality.
Here was a man who was financially secure who had no need to place himself in harms way.  Yet he not only places himself in harms way but his newly found daughter.  That just does not cook.
Any con man worth his wait in salt would never allow the con to become unstructured.  He was pressured to change the date of the con and forced to change his schedule without a fully thought out solution.  This man surely would not have done such a thing.
Con man pride themselves on pressuring their marks on making a decision or putting their marks in emotional pressure so they made a rash and non rational decision.  This skillful con man would never place him in such a position.  What was $80,000 to a millionaire?
The problem with the movie is that it is not truly logical, it assumes that you will sit in your chair and allow the story to play out and accept the events unfolding without thinking.  Rationally the movie just does not work for me.
I liked the characters that were cast perfectly.  The filming and direction was flawless, but the story was not believable.",1078790400,7,1582,4.424137931034482
1968438,5,B00012QLB4,"After directing some of the best Hollywood blockbusters,  Gladiator and Blackhawk Down, and having few flops along the way, G.I Jane, and Black Rain, Ridley Scott returns with Matchstick Men to a more intelligent, and much gentler character based movie making,the type of which he has excelled in Thelma and Louise.
I had no expectations about Matchstick Men, and while yet another 'con' movie would not have been a reason to watch it, the names Scott and Cage certainly compelled me to 'check it out' and I am so glad I did, because I can confidently say it is one of the best movies I have seen in the last two years, a film that I liken to a fine glass of wine, taken in few sips, and the after effects will be totally relaxing, and soothing.
The film while at the first glance does not seem to offer a lot, will grow on you unexpectedly and you'll carry it with you long after the credits roll.
And this is because of a fine collaborative effort from an excellent book by Eric Garcia, brilliant screenplay by Nicholas Griffin, a totally involved and sympathetic direction by Scott, and of course a mind blowing acting by Nick Cage, who yet again after Adaptation proves that he is more than capable of pulling off some of the most complex characters in cinema. Alison Lohman too proved more than capable of playing her equally complex character, an actress that has matured very well on screen.
The story of Matchstick Men seems simple enough, a phobic and neurotic Cage with a partner (Sam Rockwell) are small time con artists, who make their living by swindling housewives and lonely gullible men.
His carefully constructed world though will soon collapse with the reappearance of a long lost daughter,who will force him to break the wall he has built around himself, brick by difficult brick,and face emotions and intimacies he thought he was unable to have.
He goes through great personal turmoil in reestablishing his relationship with his 'daughter' who is interested in learning the trick of her dad's trade, while striving in the process to go straight. However, one last big con seems to ruin every hope or plan he had for his and his daughter's future.
Simple enough, until the twist at the end  when the final truth  is revealed,which came as a complete shock to me!
I loved how the change in Cage came about,how the neurosis which haunted his every move behavior and thought, were slowly undone one by one ,until he finally finds the peace of mind he so longed for.
The cons in my opinion are really trivial to the whole film and do not matter as much as Cage's transformation and realizations. At the end , it did not matter to me who that daughter really was, because she was able directly and indirectly to give Cage the break that he needed to change his life.
The ending was so serene and almost spiritual yet is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a while, because it says so much with so little language or explanations.
Matchstick Men therefore is a must see movie, one that will gently affect you by its top acting, writing and a director who can dazzle viewers with big productions but can also engage their minds and hearts with the simplest but most creative style.",1078790400,2,3204,4.5979020979020975
1968439,4,B00012QLB4,"Watching Matchstick Men is like watching fireworks on a perfect July night from your back porch patio sipping a cool glass of sun-brewed tea with all that's right in the world surrounding you...it's something you enjoy.
The screenplay must have had ""Get Nicolas Cage or no movie,"" written all over it for the part of Roy, the main protagonist, divorcee, con artist, and wonderful eccentric.  Cage plays Roy's each and every tic and quirk beautifully and the part gives him room to move and flex without becoming overbearing, over the top.  Cage's life get a tad bit more complicated (as lives do at times), when his daughter turns up, his partner wants to up the con ante, and Roy enters into psychotherapy.  If this sounds like a recipe for, ""anything can happen,"" antics, plot turns and twist, relationship nuances, ""Matchstick Men,"" won't disappoint.
Young-comer Alison Lohman plays Cage's daughter Angela to a Tee.  Her bubbly nature and forays of experimentations into the adult world make her believable and make the connection between Cage's Roy all the more...well...connected.  Although there are a few misteps along the way (a few scenes that seem to be overwrought with feigned drama) (Is it a movie about character relationships vs. Is it a movie about suspensful twists and turns?), director Ridley Scott does a great job pulling all this together into an enteraining view.

 ""Matchstick Men"" has Nicolas Cage playing Roy Waller, a great con artist, but one messed up person. Waller is full of neuroses among his biggest problems is the fact he suffers from a major case of OCD.
 ""Matchstick Men"" has a lot of plus sides to it. Cage, as most have already stated turns in a wonderful performance. He's alive and viberant. And it's a shame he didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, he's THAT good. Also Sam Rockwell does a nice job. The two have a lot of chemistry, both are fun to watch. As are some of the cons. Which really makes a movie like this. But, ""Matchstick Men"" is playing around with a couple of ideas. One deals with Roy (Cage) and Frank Mercer (Rockwell) as a couple of con artist. The other deals with Roy as a man who makes Woody Allen seem tame. And the third story has Roy coming to realize he has a 14 year old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman). All of these outlines work well, at times, but the main problem I had with the film was the fact I was able to predict the ending. Any con moie you watch, you always know to expect a big twist at the end. That's just the way these films work. Watch Mamet films like ""Heist"", ""The Spanish Prisoner"", ""House of Games"" watch other movies like ""The Grifter"" and even the recent ""Confidence"". So knowing that ""rule"" it was easy to guess what would happen. ""Matchstick Men"" as I said does have its strong points but here's an odd case where a movie has a good execution but a so-so set-up. What I mean by that is the acting is fine, Scott's directing works, I liked the cinematography by John Mathieson, and at moments (mostly the first 45 minutes are so) the screenplay by Nicholas and Ted Griffin is enjoyable, but then the film becomes predictable. Or maybe it's predictable to a small number of people since film critic Roger Ebert openly said he did not see the ending coming. If he was lying or not I don't know.
 So should you see this movie? Yes. I've named all of the film's appealing points. ""Matchstick Men"" also keeps up Scott's winning record with me, ""Gladiator"", ""Hannibal"", & ""Black Hawk Down"". This is a fun movie to watch, just remember, don't make the same mistake I did, and think about it too much. You'll spoil it for yourself.
 Bottom-line: Entertaining con movie from Ridley Scott, that may not reach the level of other con films. Has strong performances from Cage, Rockwell, and Lohman. The only downfall to the movie is the predictable ending. Still worthwhile though.",1078617600,,2659,4.544885177453027

We never learn the name of the medication. In fact, not even Roy knows the name of the medication. He calls the meds ""pygmies."" How quaint.
Director Ridley Scott films at a strip club where dancers wear bikinis. You see, they were going for that PG-13 rating. Brilliant work! Why not film that scene at a beach and avoid any resemblence to a silly network sitcom?

He has a obsessive-compulsive disorder and is borderline agorophobic, which is the fear of leaving his home. Due to his profession and personal problems, he has never been able to get close to anyone but his partner Frank, and he is slowly beginning to lose it. When his personal problems begin to spread into his professional life, Roy's partner Frank convinces him to see a psychologist. Unfortunately when Roy ventures into therapy, the doctor brings Roy to the realization that he longs to become closer to his 14 year old daughter that he abadoned at birth.

""Matchstick Men"" is easily one of the best films of 2003, and one of the best that I have seen overall. Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic. It combines elements of a con artist film with all of the twists and the turns, with a touching and loving story about a father getting to know his daughter. Mixing these two things together provides for a very well rounded story. I have seen many of Nicholas Cage's films, but he gave the best performance of his career in ""Matchstick Men"". He absolutely nailed every apsect of the character with all of the different ticks and other obsessions. The reason I was so impressed, is because he is able to switch off from being a neurotic mess, to a smooth con-artist very easily. He played both roles great. Alison Lohman was amazing in this film and deserves a lot of credit. She is 25 in real life, and played a 14 year old girl very skillfully. Sam Rockwell also puts in a top notch performance as well. However, the best thing about this film was the ending. I never saw it coming in a million years.
Overall, ""Matchstick Men"" has become one of my favorite films. It was one of the only films that I have ever seen more than once in the theater.

1968445,5,B00012QLB4,"This is one of the hardest reviews I have written,because I really don't comprehend why Matchstick Men made me feel the way it did. The plot was simple,the movie was simple (especially for someone like Scott) and the story twists were not incredibly surprising. But the movie made me think about it for days after I saw it,and that is usually a good sign.
This is the story of Roy (Cage),a con man with an obsessive compulsive disorder and many other problems. He has been divorced for more than ten years and does not have anyone but his younger partner in crime Frank (Rockwell).However,it is when he find out about his 14 year old daughter,whom he did not even know existed,that things start to get both better and complicated for Roy.
Let me begin by saying that I fell in love from the start with Cage's portrayal of Roy. This was the best I have seen him in years. He makes you really feel sympathy for Roy,care about him and believe in him. Alison Lohman was ok too,though I find her a bit disturbing,I don't know why. Rockwell had limited screen time,but made me wish for more. Ridley Scott's directing was felt all the time,made every frame of the movie a picture you can hang on your wall. The color and light usage impressed me especially.
For me,matchstick men was going fine until the last quarter,where I'm not sure things went exactly the way I was hoping they would. The cons were not extremely incredible or complicated,the story did not have huge ups and downs and I sat down and enjoyed Cage's performance. Although the ending was satisfactory logically,there was a hollow feeling in my stomach which I can not get rid of whenever I think about this film. The story twist that almost everybody mentioned, is not so unpredictable,but it is better not to try predicting anything if you want to enjoy the movie.
If not for anything,the movie is worth seen for the acting and directing,although I'm not sure many people would want to see this movie twice. I give it 5 stars for very subjective reasons,and I will definitely watch it many more times,but you may want to catch this one on tv.",1078099200,,2105,4.601063829787234

The whole movie you hope that it isn't so, but it is.  There is a little redemtive arc at the end for Cage's character, but this still leaves the audience feeling empty and unfulfilled.  I would only suggest watching this movie if you see it on cable and there is nothing else on, otherwise do not bother buying or renting it.",1078099200,6,634,4.584070796460177

I watched the whole movie hoping that wouldn't be the case, but it was, and it ruins the movie.
Minor Spoilers below.
In Roger Ebert's review of this movie, he writes that the movie has 3 plot points.  ""It is: (1) the story of a crisis in the life of a man crippled by neurotic obsessions; (2) the story of two con men who happen onto a big score, and (3) the story of a man who meets the teenage daughter he never knew he had, and finds himself trying to care for her.
I strongly disagree.  This movie is a story of a conman who meets his teenage daughter and tries to care for her and grow close to her.  That is all the movie is about.  Through getting to know his daughter, she gets involved in some of his cons.  But the father/daughter relationship is the center of the movie.
The ending of Matchstick Men renders the entire movie meaningless.  I'm reminded of Vanilla Sky's ending which showed that Tom Cruise had dreamt the entire movie.  Similarly, in Matchstick Men, if nothing before the ending is real, then why should the movie matter, know matter how well it is made.
I did think all of the acting was great, especially by Cage and Lohman.  I just didn't like the ending at all.",1078099200,9,1528,4.3674911660777385
1968448,4,B00012QLB4,"""Matchstick Men"" is one of the `hidden assets' of 2003. It did only fairly well at the boxoffice and was ignored at the yearend's awards feeding frenzy. This clever, subversive thriller from director Ridley Scott [""Gladiator"", ""Alien""] is a delight from start to finish. If it has a fault, it is that a plot twist near the end is so surprising and cruel that it was necessary to tack on a happy ending; however, said ending is both appropriate and logical, since the underlying theme is one of redemption.
Roy Waller [Nicolas Cage] is a lifelong con artist. He is a mass of nervous ticks, a walking definition of obsessive-compulsive disorder. His partner, Frank [Sam Rockwell] is calm, cool and collected. He puts up w Roy because Roy, is the master con. When Roy goes to a new shrink, it occurs to him that he may have had a child by his ex-wife fourteen years ago. The doctor verifies that he did, and Roy searches out the child, a bright, vivacious girl named Angela [Alison Lohman]. Father and daughter instantly bond. Meanwhile, Roy and his partner have the biggest con of their lives going on. At first a hindrance, Angela soon becomes a partner in crime, as though conning people was almost a genetic trait.
Cage, replete with nervous ticks and some speech impediments, is both funny and endearing as Roy, a con man who knows all too well the price his profession extracts from one's sole. Rockwell and Lohman are also excellent.
""Matchstick Men"" is probably the most entertaining and rewarding thriller of 2003.",1078012800,,1520,4.739622641509434

Look for Bruce Mcgill in a key supporting role.  The soundtrack is to die for...Sinatra, Sinatra, Sinatra and one of Hans Zimmer's best scores.

1968451,5,B00012QLB4,"A Tour de Force for Nicholas Cage
Ridley Scott CAN do intimate stories; not everything he touches has to depend on the grand scale of Gladiator.  In MATCHSTICK MEN he has taken a small-scale story and created a wholly believable tale of intrigue, surprises, tenderness, and unconventional outcomes.
Matchstick men is another term for grifters or con artists and Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell are small scale but superb practitioners of the trade. Cage plays Roy, a neurotic, twitchy, obsessive compulsive agoraphobic  mess of a man who despite is fear of the outdoors is the main brain behind enormously clever scams.  His partner Frank as played by Sam Rockwell is as casual as Roy is uptight and the two play the opposite ends of the spectrum of normalcys bell curve to the hilt.  As the film opens the two are in action, demonstrating their skills in small time trade. But enter Chuck (Bruce McGill) as a target for big time money and the speed accelerates. Roy, who controls his neuroses by medication, accidentally loses his pills down the garbage disposal, freaks, and ultimately in desperation finds a psychiatrist (the very smooth Bruce Altman) with the intent of gaining a prescription for more meds.
Enter Angela (Alison Lohman, the 14-year-old daughter Roy abandoned when he left his pregnant wife 14 years ago, and the story alters.  Though initially terrified of the prospect of being with his daughter, he gradually warms to her, especially when he discovers that Angela is keen on learning her fathers trade.  Roy  and Frank reluctantly include Angela in a major scam against Chuck and the remainder of the film is a tense roll of how everything than can go wrong, indeed does.  The ending of the story is so well done and such a surprise to the audience that watching the closing credits leaves you stunned. This is a superb (for lack of a better category) mystery.  Ridley leads his cast of magically fine actors in a pace that never lets up and he sweeps us along with it, despite ourselves!  Highly recommended.",1077926400,,2031,4.84393063583815
1968452,4,B00012QLB4,"Nicholas Cage plays Roy a man with so many nervous ticks he could be the atomic clock. Roy's house, the muisc he listens to (Frank Sinatra) and his very essence has been imported from the early 60's into the 21st Century. Unfortunately, Roy lives a life trapped in routine; he suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder caused by the way he lives his life; he's a flimflam man, a con man with more cons than a cardshark has aces up his sleeve. Roy's obsessive compulsive behavior and tics are out of control because his supplier of medication has skipped town. Without his illegally obtained medication, Roy is out of control and goes into extreme cleaning mode. He can't function and he can't work because his nervous ticks and behavior will give him away.
His obnoxious and messy partner Frank (the marvelous Sam Rockwell) urges him to see a shrink.  Now he must see a real doctor and discuss his very real problems something very much against his nature. His new psychiatrist Dr. Klein manages to get Roy on the couch just long enough to discover that Roy has a daughter he's never seen and an ex-wife that has told more lies than she has fingers about his whereabouts. Dr. Klein urges Roy to contact his daughter suggesting part of his problems may be related to the fact that he has no one to relate to and leads a solitary, lonely life. Roy's life takes both a turn for the better and the worse as his daughter turns out to have a talent for conning all her own...
""Matchstick Men"" plays almost like a dysfunctional variation on ""The Sting"" with quirky, nebbish characters at its heart. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"") shows he has a deft ability with comedy in this unique film.  His clever use of 60's and 50's stylistic touches and Cage's rich performance make ""Matchstick Men"" instantly memorable and enjoyable. All the members of the supporting cast are of an equal caliber. Rockwell steals many of the scenes he shares with Cage, which is quite an accomplishment, and Allison Lohman does a great job playing Roy's seemingly sweet but manipulative daughter. The plot features enough twists and turns for a high-grade roller coaster.  Kudos must also be given to screenwriters Nicholas and Ted Griffin for their sardonic and rich screenplay. While the audience can see where the film is leading well before the final third of the film creating sympathy for some very unsypathetic characters, Scott and his cast make the ride as entertaining as possible.
The rich and colorful transfer of ""Matchstick Men"" looks exceptional. The warm colors of Southern California come across in the rich cinematographer by John Matheison and are faithfully reproduced on the DVD as well.
Viewers won't get burned with the extras on this single disc, dual layer edition. There's an in-depth feature length documentary focusing on the entire process of making a motion picture. It's a fascinating glimpse into the process of making a motion picture for film fans.  There's also a interesting commentary track from Scott and the screenwriters.
A funny, entertaining movie with some very cool and unique extras, ""Matchstick Men"" shows that Scott way with comedy. Cage, Rockwell, Lohman and McGill all give funny, detailed performances that are highlighted in the marvelous commentary as well as the production featurettes. The sharp transfer looks exceptional despite some minor digital blemishes. ""Matchstick Men"" is definitely worth picking up, as you'll enjoy the rich, detailed world that Scott and his collaborators have created.",1077926400,,3571,4.996638655462185
1968453,5,B00012QLB4,"Nicolas Cage plays Roy, a master con-artist handicapped by a constellation of psychological problems, including agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Professional success has given him a nice home and car and plenty of money, but he's friendless, has no family, and cannot seem to connect with anyone except his protege, Frank (Sam Rockwell), who wants Roy to put together an ambitious swindle so they can make a big score together.  Roy's life is further complicated by a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) who forces him to confront his own guilt, and by his efforts to build a belated relationship with the abandoned daughter he never knew (Alison Lohman).
Enter a wealthy, unscrupulous mark (Bruce McGill) whom Frank & Roy set up for the big score, and all the pieces are in place for this unique grifter tale adapted by Nicholas & Ted Griffin from Eric Garcia's book.  The story has nearly as many twists and turns as Mamet's HOUSE OF GAMES and THE SPANISH PRISONER, but there is much more to it than an ingeniously entertaining plot.  At times it seems like a dark comedy that tickles the intellect more than the funny bone, yet it never fails to respect each of its characters and to regard Roy's predicament seriously.  The unfolding story reveals surprising emotional and spiritual depth as Roy reluctantly confronts his karma and begins a quest for redemption.  By suffering the consequences of his choices--and accepting responsibility for them--Roy discovers the power of forgiveness to radically transform his life.
Nicolas Cage is at his best as Roy.  He pulls off an impressive balancing act by creating a believable, sympathetic, and fully-human character from material more prone to derivative mediocrity.  The supporting cast is equally good, with not one sour note among the players.  Rockwell gives his best performance since GALAXY QUEST.  Newcomer Lohman shows star potential in her convincing portrayal of a girl scarcely half her own age.  Altman is perfect as the psychiatrist, and Bruce McGill again demonstrates why he is the heir-apparent to the late J.T. Walsh as the consummate character actor.
Director Ridley Scott, of course, is one of the few contemporary masters of cinema.  The auteur behind such landmark films as THE DUELLISTS, ALIEN, and BLADE RUNNER, in recent years he has de-emphasized the breathtaking imagery that established his reputation and now employs his impeccable filmcraft in making more apparently conventional Hollywood-type movies--i.e. THELMA AND LOUISE, GLADIATOR, and BLACK HAWK DOWN.  With MATCHSTICK MEN, he reinterprets the con-artist flick, a perennially popular sub-genre (THE STING, PAPER MOON).  True to form, it is masterfully crafted.  Cinematographer John Mathieson (GLADIATOR) and editor Dody Dorn (MEMENTO) share the credit, for every shot is impeccably framed and the brilliant editing calls so little attention to itself that even Oscar overlooked it.
In short, this is an unpretentious and deceptively unambitious movie that succeeds on every artistic level.  The MPAA may not have deemed it Oscar worthy, but posterity may judge it more favorably than any of this year's Best Picture nominees.  If you appreciate tight plotting, good acting, subtle wit, splendid craftsmanship, memorable characters, and a story that rings emotionally true, you will probably like this movie as much as I did.  Five solid stars.",1077926400,12,3389,5.302803738317757
1968454,2,B00012QLB4,"I did not especially appreciate this film. Calling this a comedy/drama is stretching both categories and after viewing it you do not come away with any sense of finality or satisfaction.
  The characters have no real charisma where you can relate to them or sympathize with their predicament. Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the phobia-ridden Roy but after a while his facial tics and mannerisms become distracting. The camera angles with constant ""thru the window"" shots are annoying and unecessary. There are some rather confusing scenes towards the end especially between Roy and his ex-wife. If you listen to the directors commentary, on the DVD,  at this point he comes across very pompous, self-serving and totally uncaring about his audience.

1968455,2,B00012QLB4,"Really had high hopes after a long week to just come home and watch a good movie.  Picked this movie because of the outstanding reviews; famous action director Ridley Scott at the helm; and Nicolas Cage who I thought was great in Con Air and The Rock.  Oh my god, this movie was so boring!  I knew it wasn't going to be an action flick, but it was soooooo slow!  Have you ever watched a movie and debated about just stopping because it's so lame.  Half-way thru this snoozer that's exactly how I felt, but I thought, ""Hey, I paid good money for this rental.  I might as well finish it to see if it gets better.""  It improved a little bit, but due to some foreshadowing by Ridley, I was able to guess what happened to Nicholas Cage's character Roy before it happened.  Redeeming qualities are that Alison Lohman did a terrific job of acting, but great acting can't overcome a story that's not compelling.  I also was pleased by the sentimental ending where ultimately good things happen for Nicholas Cage's character Roy.
But overall, it was very disappointing and I would rather have watched 4 consecutive episodes of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" than to have wasted the 2 hours watching this bore-fest.",1077926400,3,1200,4.596244131455399
1968456,4,B00012QLB4,"Ridley Scott has once again delivered an excellent movie, reassuring his might in Hollywood, although there was little doubt after his string of success. ""Matchstick Men"" is a con comedy, about a man (Nicholas Cage) who finally decides to go after the big score with his partner (Sam Rockwell). Things become complicated when he meets the daughter he never knew he had (Alison Lohman), and she begins to show an interest in the skill of cons.
The acting in this film is superb, and the casting is absolutely perfect. Nicholas Cage, who has made some awful movies in his day, returns to the form of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Adaptation"", mastering all the ticks and nuances of his character, who is afflicted with numerous disorders, including obsessive-compulsive. Sam Rockwell shows again why he is becoming one of the more sought-after actors out there, as this is the third movie I have seen him shine in, after ""Welcome to Collingwood"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"". He could be one of the greatest actors in a few years time, because he plays every character with such an irresistable charm and sense of humour. Also, I cannot say enough about the beautiful Alison Lohman. Don't worry, it's okay that I say that, because she is actually 24 years old, despite the youthful characters she always plays. She showed us in ""White Oleander"" that she was going to be great, and she continues that in ""Matchstick Men"". As the daughter, she plays a hardened girl washed over with the innocence of youth, and the confusion between disliking her mother and just only meeting her long estranged father.
The writers of this movie did an excellent job in creating great chemistry between the characters, brought out in the strong performances by the actors. The partner relationship of Cage and Rockwell is excellent, as there is a mutual respect and friendship between the two men. But the real prize here is the father-daughter chemistry crated by Cage and Lohman, which is dead-on. With both of them nailing their performances, their interaction seemed completely normal and seamless.
Although the plot here may be a tad predictable, as most heist/con movies tend to be, but Scott's directing allows us to enjoy this film until the end. I have heard some people complain about the ending, saying that it should have ended before the ""One year later..."" part, but I don't know about that, because the ending allows the characters to come full-circle, showing that they are whole people in the end, and that there can be forgiveness to all their deceit and pain.
Overall, ""Matchstick Men"" is a must-see movie, because it gives us all the elements of a great film, starting with the director and the solid script and ending with the great performances by some great actors.",1077667200,4,2771,4.872881355932203
1968457,5,B00012QLB4,"Ridley Scott has never instilled confidence in me when I watch his films. Granted, his visual flair and ability to handle exceptionally grand subjects is a virtue I would not take for granted. But whilst films like Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain and Thelma and Louise remain standards of their respective genres his recent work has almost diluted into typical Hollywood fare that one could confuse with a number of different directors. For differing reasons I have found the following films, 1492, White Squall, GI Jane, Gladiator, Hannibal and Black Hawk Down, to be extremely disappointing. Now I for one am glad so many people have enjoyed these films, and I would rather be one of you than merely pass on watching them again. I won't delve into my gripes with each film, as this review is about one that I have no gripes for at all; Matchstick Men.
Something is wildly attractive when a film combines the acting talents of Cage and Rockwell, and the visionary director Ridley Scott (who seems to find the best work in Hans Zimmer and his DOP of recent choice, John Mathieson). It is a small story on scale compared to Scott's other work. Far smaller, yet for me one that packs a far greater punch.
In a nutshell the film is about a conman, one who is afflicted with an OCD that puts his partner on edge. To his surprise, his daughter of 14 years old, whom he never knew existed, crashes into his life. What follows is a combination of great comedy and drama that really refreshes your mind when lined up against recent Hollywood fare (and should have been recognised in a number of categories of recent award ceremonies).
Take my word for it when I say this film is a technical triumph. The cinematography, editing, sound, costumes and sets work beautifully to create a comedy that impresses you with its visceral beauty and often leaves you cold with some harsh realities. The music, by Hans Zimmer, augments the visuals, much alike John Williams' score in Catch Me If You Can, by providing a lurid energy that supports the eccentricities of the two lead actors. Then in Alison Lohman the audience is enraptured by a sweet young actress, reminding you of the initial promise of Natalie Portman. And finally, the main man himself, Ridley Scott. To ignore his profound understanding of visuals and mise en scene would be to deny this film of one of its greatest virtues. It really is a sight to behold at times, begging to be frozen at times just so you can see how light bounces of objects, the colour varies and the actors move around the sets. His films will always have that quality (even GI Jane) but finally here he allows the actors to simply perform a quirky, heartfelt and wonderfully zippy script. The film is not without its flaws, but a film of this nature rarely is. I enjoyed the final scenes, whereas some people found it to be a disappointing resolution. Regardless, it still entertains on a high level.
And now the DVD. Having been accustomed to these shiny discs since they made their way to England in the late 90s I have been able to form an idea of what the best DVD is. It isn't about the quantity; the numerous deleted scenes (honestly, half the time they are completely unnecessary), trailers, music videos, bloopers, EPKs. The 'Making Of' featurettes are almost always dry, either too short or too long, lacking insight and are usually press promos that you wonder why they even bothered in the first place. It's about two things; quality, and a blimming commentary track. Now a commentary track does not have to include the director (however, clearly the most important person when it comes to talking about the craft and meaning of a film). But when a film is subject to months of preparation, shooting and post, then clearly people will have a great deal to divulge. Commentaries seem to reveal the most about a film, and thankfully here we have the director, a writer and writer/producer talking over the film. Commentaries of course vary in quality, and here we have a very good one. Rarely reaching the self-congratulatory tones often trod on, the filmmakers speak about the film as mature adults should; with a balanced reverence (or pride) and objectivity that allows them to evolve as artists.
Then you have what is arguably, as the amazon reviewer states, one of the best DVD features yet made. From prep to post, 'Tricks of the Trade' is a long, detailed, off-the-wall look into the making of this film. With seemingly full co-operation with everyone on board, this documentary pretty much covers all the main factors of filmmaking (scouting locations, casting, choosing crew, safety on set, writing, adapting from original texts, acting, costumes, set design, editing, testing on audiences, writing music, and naturally, when things go wrong). Just the nature of the doc gives you a wonderful insight into the industry. The ill-conceived notion that making big budget films is a breeze, where people are over paid turning up in their limos is challenged here. Everyone works extremely hard, being as professional as can be to work to a schedule and produce work of an incomparable standard (or, you don't get hired next time). An interesting part of this films creation is during post where Hans Zimmer has to completely re-write his original score as it completely changed the film's intended tone. One criticism is the film ignores the sound editing process, which is a shame as the sound in this film greatly enhances the storyline and the characters. Ultimately 'Tricks of the Trade' shows that the director is a genius. A Ridley Scott set seems to be one of the best to work on in Hollywood at the moment, and this film and documentary shows you why.
The picture and sound transfers are excellent. Wonderful sound mix (extremely atmospheric, classic sound track, crisp dialogue) and the visuals are true to the cinematographer's achievement.
So all in all a great package. A film that has already become underrated, Scott's best work in the past ten years is in my opinion destined to become a film fan's best kept secret. Enjoy.",1077667200,2,6075,4.78116079923882
1968458,4,B00012QLB4,"Highlights: Nic Cage's performance; witty script; poignant themes; assured direction.
Lowpoints: Slight slips into sentimentality; forgettable.
Conclusion: 'Matchstick Men' is a well made con film/family drama/comedy, supplemented by an intelligent script, R. Scott's elegant direction, and a quirky protagonist. There is almost no 'ham' (apart from where the filmmakers just couldn't help pull the 'tear-strings' a little bit), which is a common expectation in a Hollywood parent/offspring relationship exploitation. The film excites, amuses, and is even touching due to the subdued ending. Despite its' effective qualities though, it still belonges to a genre of forgettable features.",1077408000,,686,6.15625
1968459,4,B00012QLB4,"Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"" is best enjoyed seen NOT as a film about a con game -- the trick the film is trying to show is too incredible for me -- but seen as ""father-daughter"" drama it becomes more engaging.  And Alison Lohman is so good (far better than in ""White Oliander) that anyway you forgive some obvious flaws of the film.
Nicolas Cage is a con man living in the sunshine-filled San Felnando Valley, where he and with his partner Sam Rockwell do their ""jobs"" getting easy money from unsuspecting people.  One unique thing about our Nick is, he is not only agoraphobia, but also obsessively urged to make everything clean -- he is a kind of a guy who keeps on vacuum-cleaning the carpet for hours.  So, he keeps a dog, the dog made of china.
Then Allison Lohman, as his 14-year-old daughter newly-found, stumbles in his life, who literally litters snacks, and doesn't care if she lies on the couch with dirty shoes.  At first he panicks (why not), but he is then persuaded by her to take her under his wing, and even to make her a protege of his con game.
As I said, the film gives us a surprising story, but it is not that story itself that really engage our attention.  It is the plausible and tenderly-depicted relations between Nick Cage and Alison Lohman, which develops in spite of (or because of) unusual situations.  Nicholas Cage's acting as caring father is very convincing, and so is Alison Lohman's slightly reckless and still lovable girl.
Strangely I found his acting labored when Nicholas Cage shows tics on his face.  Obviously he is trying to give authenticity without offending the real-life people, but it is painfully clear that he is acting.  I do not disagree if you say his acting is good, but still it is artificial, and it shows.
The greatest thing you find in ""Matchstick Men"" is Alison Lohman's delightful acting.  And she played a 14-year-old girl when she was in fact 23.  This is quite a nice touch of deceiving, too.",1077148800,,1960,4.590257879656161

1968462,5,B00012QLB4,"This cross between ""The Sting"" and ""Paper Moon"" pits master con artist Roy (Nicholas Cage) against himself.  He has the smooth moves, the grasp of the intricate game he must play, the equally smooth partner (Sam Rockwell), but he cannot master his own obsessive-compulsive urges which manifest themselves in agoraphobia, tics, and, at times, full paralysis.  When his partner Mark insists that he sees a shrink for his problems, Roy makes halting progress, leading to his discovery of his previously unknown teenage daughter Angela (Alison Lohman.)  What happens next is both hilarious and heartbreaking as Cage exposes his character's heart tic by tic during his biggest con scheme yet.
I cannot fault a single performance in this film.  No one plays comedic pathos the way Cage does, and he is at his absolute best here - even non-fans might be converted.  Supporting actress Alison Lohman's performance is bubbly, nuanced, and adorable, making Roy's instant affection for Angela completely believable.  The direction, screenplay, and other supporting performances add yet another layer of perfection to the film.
