Having finished the tutorial, I have the following COMPLAINTS:

1) The provider cares ZERO about the quality of his product.  The audio voice-over does not follow the FRANTIC onscreen cursor movements.  The provider should have recorded the audio first, and then made the visual content follow the audio. In this case, audio and video are disconnected much of the time, and it BITES!  The mouse cursor is flying around, opening windows and making numerous important changes while the narrator is talking about...something else. A minute later (if ever) the narrator describes that earlier frantic, unexplained visual content you were struggling to understand.  Like I said, IT BITES.

2) The tutorial is paced far faster than it should be (you'll have to watch it multiple times to understand much) yet there's a lot of room left on the disc.  So why are some of the program's most important features/functions never mentioned?

3) The screenshot Flash video format is way too choppy/jumpy for this type of material.  The instructor's cursor chooses menu items from drop-down lists, but the choices cannot be seen due to the video frames ""skipping"" at that crucial moment.  And the narrator almost never confirms verbally the choices that are being made.

4) Some of the example/content ACID Pro files are not included on the tutorial CD.  It took FOUR (4) exchanges of email before the so-called Customer Service rep finally admitted that the files I was seeking ARE NOT ON THE DISC.  Dishonesty BITES, too.

PRICE:  You get what you pay for (cheap)
DELIVERY:  Very quick, directly from the manufacturer.

I bought this tutorial to help me learn Sony Acid Pro *7* because there's no complete, comprehensive training to be found for Acid Pro 7.  Even Sony's own ""Seminar Series"" teaches only the *new* features of the latest version, which is okay for upgrade buyers but not helpful for we who bought the entire program.

Acid Pro 7 has a lot in common with 6, which introduced many important new features beyond version 5.  So this v6 tutorial is worthwhile, but only at the discounted $19 price.",1245024000,,2137,4.91340782122905

This tutorial is not boring. It gets you what you need as you need it. It really helped me make the transition from using Sonar 6 to Using Acid 6 pro instead. I am enjoying multi tracking again thanks to this product and Acid Pro 6",1194912000,2,337,4.365079365079365
8325116,5,B000FUUH8A,"When Acid Pro 5 came out, I bought the Sony Seminar Series DVD.  It was a good course, but at $100 it was kind of pricey.  So I thought I'd give this Digital Music Doctor course at try for Acid Pro 6.  For $35 I didn't really expect as much content as the Sony course, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a very complete course.  All the new features of Acid Pro 6--like multitrack recording, midi, and even the Kompakt sampler--are covered in quite a bit of detail.  I especially like the example projects that come with the course.  The examples are pretty simple, but they do a good job illustrating how to accomplish various tasks in Acid.  Putting things like creating loops, editing midi, and mixing in the context of an actual project is much more meaningful than just showing which button to push.",1150243200,11,807,4.517241379310345
