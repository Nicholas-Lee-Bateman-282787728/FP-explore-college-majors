Watched so many movies but nothing compares to this.
you have to watch Hoodlum after then watch American Gangster to follow.
They are all connected.",1492128000,,209,4.675675675675675

8180269,4,B000NOKAF8,This movie came out straight to DVD.  It was released in 1992. So unless you saw it back then like a lot of old movies you are not gonna really appreciate it. This was like the starting point for a few actors. Lots of violence. Over the top dialogue. Gangsters killing gangsters. Double crosses.  What more can you ask for?,1426032000,,323,4.366666666666666

8180271,2,B000NOKAF8,This DVD should not have been released for sale.  The actors are not efficient to act and the story is awful.,1313452800,,109,4.190476190476191
8180272,4,B000NOKAF8,"DVD shipped brand new and plays fine, is not a offical release but a bootleg kinda release, but hey it plays and i enjoyed it",1302566400,,125,4.04
8180273,4,B000NOKAF8,"The movie has some errors in production and direction, besides having a photography too dark sometimes. The actors are not all so good and the choice of faces to some character profiles is not very intelligent. However, the script is rich, surprising, full of brightness and high points, and the soundtrack is spectacular, reminding even the mighty GOD FATHER. Undoubtedly, despite the weaknesses, this is still a movie you have to watch.",1293580800,2,438,5.097222222222222
8180274,3,B000NOKAF8,"The film was very interesting.  It was not a picture that would sell out in the movie theaters, but it was fairly interesting.  Not historically accurate either, but the people that made the movie tried to include as many big name figures from New York at the time.  A good viewing experience for people looking for another Mob Movie to watch.",1223510400,,343,4.590163934426229
