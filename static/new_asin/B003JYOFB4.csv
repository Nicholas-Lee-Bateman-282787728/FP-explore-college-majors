4131457,5,B003JYOFB4,"The format of this film is a series of extremely thought provoking vignettes. I found premise itself quite sad, as the plot concerns a 2055 archivist in a world where the arctic ice sheet has melted, the global population has drastically shrunk, and it's clear humanity is on the verge of extinction. The archivist's children are still alive (barely), but his grandchildren have all died.

The most helpful vignettes for me were those featuring climate scientists clarifying the notion of the tipping point - the average temperature rise that will set off an unstoppable chain reaction putting further global warming beyond the control of mankind.

Average global temperature has already increased one degree since the start of the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century. Climate scientists (and most government leaders) agree there will be a tipping point if we allow temperature to rise one more degree. At an average temperature two degrees above pre-industrial levels, there will be a massive kill-off of trees (which absorb CO2) and a massive release of methane (the most damaging greenhouse gas) from the Siberian permafrost. This, in turn, will automatically send global temperatures shooting up another four degrees - making the earth to hot to sustain advanced life forms (mainly because their food sources will die out).

These scientific vignettes also helped me get my head around the time line associated with these events. It will take a minimum of thirty years for emissions from the fossil fuels we burn in 2010 to result in higher global temperatures. According to the mathematical model constructed by climate scientists, we have until 2013 to start steeply reducing CO2 emissions - by a rate that would cut the industrial world's emissions 80% by 2050.

If we continue to increase emissions past 2013 (instead of reducing them), it will probably be too late. We can expect global temperatures to achieve their two degree increase by 2043 and then rapidly shoot up (due to tree destruction and methane release) rapidly by another four degrees.

The other vignettes that really hit home for me were those showing how many of us (myself included) are very passionate about reducing carbon emissions. And yet continue to make personal choices incompatible with this goal.

Air travel for example. It makes no sense to change light bulbs and forgo car trips and to continue to use air travel for transportation. I was astonished to learn that a family of four can scrupulously reduce their carbon footprint by the requisite 80% and totally undo three years of good work with a single 2-3 hour plane trip.

The film makes no mention of purchasing carbon offsets to compensate for air trips (there are numerous schemes to allow air travelers to pay to plant trees to compensate for their CO2 emissions). However this approach does nothing to reduce demand for air travel - which is the only way to reduce total flights and the massive amount of CO2 they produce.

In fact, given we only have three years to begin drastic CO2 reduction, the time has come to challenge people who still fly frequently for business reasons. Especially with the ready availability of video conferencing facilities, they need to ask themselves the hard question every time they feel tempted to make an airline reservation:

Is getting on this plane - or even making  money - more important than ensuring the survival of my children and grandchildren?",1292284800,6,3449,5.045694200351494

4131459,5,B003JYOFB4,"The year is 2055.  All of Earth's history, as recorded by humans, has been preserved in the ""Archive.""  The Archive's Librarian (Pete Postlethwaite) is making a video recording of his thoughts regarding the global environmental catastrophes over the past 50 years.  Looks like the climate change deniers were wrong, wrong, wrong, and the Librarian reviews actions, particularly during the period 1980-2005, in the UK, Nigeria, the Middle East, and India.

Toward the end of his review, the Librarian laments, ""Why didn't we save ourselves when we had the chance?""

Some of the more powerful moments are when an English town votes to deny the permit needed for constructing a wind energy farm (""Of course there is a need for alternative energy... we'll just find it elsewhere,"" one opponent says after celebrating the defeat [my paraphrase]).  And the need to improve the ""standard of living"" for people in India, Nigeria, and elsewhere, while whittling away at the global greenhouse gas emissions.

No, this was not a documentary.  No, this was not supposed to be a fair and balanced view of the debate.

However, it will stimulate discussion.  Guaranteed.  Age of Enlightenment?  Age of Reason?  And now, an Age of Stupid.  What will our children's children say about us?

Our guide through the malaise is Oscar nominated actor Pete Postlethwaite who touch screens us back to our stupidity. Check out the Trailer:  [...]

This movie will make you feel uncomfortable - uncomfortable that we are not doing more to ween ourselves off oil. A sense of hopelessness that our Congress as a bought and paid for arm of  corporate oil industry will never make the laws to effect the changes necessary. Get this movie; get scared; do something!",1286668800,2,599,4.632075471698113
4131461,4,B003JYOFB4,"This is a British made documentary and is more about consumerism than global warming. The film is set in 2055, 50 years ahead of 2005 where most of data comes from. The big problem with global warming is that there is about a 40 year time lag before we see the effects of what we have done today which will affect our grand kids. The message of the film is that we have to act now to avoid a runaway increase in temperature of 6 deg. Some of the effects of global warming shown included; that the Sahara desert is increasing by three miles per year; a glacier near Mt Blanc that dropped by 145m since 1945 and in Alaska the average winter temperature has increased by 4 degrees since the 1960's. Global warming will increase the number of larger hurricanes like Katrina in 2005, because of higher ocean temperatures.

The future looks bleak because of consumerism; India and China are becoming consumer countries, they are hardly likely to reduce carbon emissions, China is building a new power station every three days. The example given in India is a man setting up a low cost airline, he is buying 26 planes to add to India's 200 planes, China has 800 planes, and the smallish SW airline in America has 417. Flying in a plane has a very large carbon footprint, in a transatlanic flight, you consume about your own body weight in fuel. America the biggest polluter is hardly going to reduce its emissions.

Examples of stupidity in the film were the British who did not like wind farms in their back yard. 80% of planning applications for wind farms are turned down, if they were accepted then we would have 10% of our power from wind. If we do not like wind farms how can we ask the developing world to cut down. The squandering of our oil resources, which are limited, but our consumer society relies on oil, we are nearing peak production. Near Mt Blanc there is the tunnel to Italy, the French send potatoes to Italy by truck to be made into mash, and then brought back. The French also send milk to Italy by truck and back to France as Yoghurt, this is madness. Then there are the gas flares in Nigeria which emit 70 million tons a year of CO2.

It shows how oil is worth fighting for, as in Iraq, and it covers two Iraqi children who fled to Jordan.

The film proposes carbon rationing as a solution, but this will be too late. As climate change starts to hit us and resources get low, it is obvious that wars will take place. The future looks bleak for our grand children, will we act now? I doubt it.

The DVD is worth buying; it is a bit slow, so only 4 stars. It is very thought provoking and worth getting. The packaging is in paper (rather than plastic which comes from oil) and there is a bonus DVD. It comes with hilarious stickers, saying ""Stupid"", that you should not put on cheap airline ads or on 4x4's - would be very very naughty. Don't even think about it.

4131462,5,B003JYOFB4,"Relax everyone, sit back and watch our destruction. Get into the demographics of our death by watching this great production.

It really is, awesome. And informative. It takes the viewer from the burning oil fields of somewhere to the poor children selling our used shoes somewhere else, and everything in between (China, OIL, Consumerism, WAR, consumption, Warming, The Wind-power Fight vs Scenery, etc.).

The childrens' parents are dead from the American Military (whoops!) and their unfortunate brother happened to be wearing nylon when the bombs fell (darn!) took that skin right off. The 5-year-old states very seriously, that if he ever sees an American, he will kill them. Almost want to get that bugger Before he reaches military age.

Hearing people leave vicious messages on the machine of a UK person fighting for wind-power is HYSTERICAL. ""We will blow them up! And I have a cottage in Scotland too, where I'll do the same!"" Do they have FOX news in the Empire yet? Well, whatever.

It's a great two hours. Worth every moment of your time, and in a major way, required if you want the human race to survive in any way, intact.

4131463,5,B003JYOFB4,"Although the perspective is set from the future, the story is really about *us*, about the choices we are making *now*, that won't affect ""future generations, 10.000 years from now"" - but... our children. It shows a guy in 2055 looking at what we did today, and what happened the last 10 or 20 years or so. There were plenty dramatic events going on, and apparently, nobody was taking notice...

Katrina was a huge warning of what's happening when climate goes berserk. Ocean temperatures rising produce more and more intense hurricanes.

Or take the war in Iraq. This is not about ""weapons of mass destruction"". This is not about ""democracy"". This is a ""resource war"". Even Alan Greenspan literally said it and is quoted in this movie : it is all about OIL. The US and in broader terms the whole western civilization is built on (cheap) oil. Oil provides cars and planes with fuel, it even produces ""food"" (be it full of pesticides and with few nutrients). The big problem is that oil corrupted the governments, and they do absolutely nothing to stop the way our ""civilization"" is built. We are in a position we cannot expect our ""democratic"" governments to take any action. If we want to take action, we'll have to do it ourselves. And it won't be easy.

This movie is built along several story lines. The strongest ones are built around an Indian businessman and an English wind farm developer.

The Indian businessman wants to offer cheap flying from one rupee onwards to all Indian people, and... succeeds...

The wind farm developer wants Britain to build more and more wind farms. Although he personally has his own wind turbine to supply his family, he wants to build a wind farm for 11.000 families, but this project is successfully stopped by some neighbors, who don't want a wind farm ""in their backyard"", because it would ""spoil the view"". That is an argument I really cannot relate to. Every time I see a wind turbine, I am a happy guy. I see clean energy - zero carbon emissions.

Humankind is committing suicide. We are definitively not homo ""sapiens"". The title of this movie is right. We live the age of stupid. Although 99% of the scientists say climate change is real, 60 % of the people think that if they ignore climate change enough, it won't happen...

Homo sapiens has only lived for about 200.000 years on this planet. We used to love our kids. We used to leave the planet - our families and our communities - in a better state we found them in. That was called progress. Now most people believe in consumerism, but an ever-expanding growth on just one not-expanding planet is impossible. We really face suicide.

Destruction doesn't start with a consumption ( where as I agree we do make a choice whether to support or not to support a specific supply ) but it begins with the way we treat one another : people we do and do not know , people that we like and dislike ( usually for selfish reasons ) and people who can and can't do anything for us.",1359417600,3,577,3.8983050847457625
4131466,4,B003JYOFB4,"Overall, I enjoyed this docurama.  It was filled with episodes of grievous social injustice and outrageous alarmist propaganda.  Not to mention the movie's high production value, slick production, and fine acting.

For the most part, I agree with just about everything the film states as fact, and most everything it suggests as a solution.  It seems that our troubles are due to global warming, and global warming is due to our use of oil, coal, and other hydrocarbons.  The fact that America's industrial and military might was built on cheap oil, lead to over-industrialization, which in turn lead to consumerism (to buy up all the things industry produced), and the ingrained lifestyle notion that we (Americans) are entitled to the world's resources, to be taken by force when expedient.  The same mindset is true of other industrialized countries, to a lesser extent.  But we are all running out of oil.

The movie claims that we are bringing about our own extinction, with rising sea levels, increased desertification, more severe storms, lower crop yields, and the ensuing social collapse that these forces will bring about.  2015 is projected to be the point of no return - if we can't save ourselves by then, the movie predicts that we, as a species, will perish.  Indeed, global climate change is the excuse given for drastic population reduction and the push for one world government, but it may be that these circumstances, as real as they are, are nothing but excuses for not making a better, more humane world, instead of relying on the greed and venial tendencies which have brought our world to this impending doom.

My point of disagreement with the video is the solution package presented:
1. Create carbon budgets for all
2. Change from (hydro-) carbon fuels to wind and solar
3. End the cheap, plastic (petroleum-based), disposable products industry.
4. Cut back on the aviation industry

My disagreement isn't that these are bad ideas, but that they are so limited in scope, and thus in effects.  I see little emphasis on energy conservation, curtailing nearly all frequent long-distance travel, development of sustainable lifestyles, and far greater social- and economic- justice.  Having high efficiency mass transportation in urban areas and pervasive video teleconferencing infrastructure would be a better use of investment dollars than would be adding another airline to the sky.

Having read ""The Chilling Stars"" by Henrik Svensmark and Nigel Calder, I am convinced that global temperatures are largely modulated by cloud cover, which is in turn, determined by high engery cosmic rays and solar magnetic activity.  And while green house gases do contribute to global warming, the cosmic ray - cloud cover mechanism has a greater effect.  So, it is impossible to claim that any specific date represents a tipping point.

Also, the most frequent excuse for not changing our (industrialized nations') destructive habits is economic impact.  The film belittles this aptly named ""stupidity"", but does nothing to suggest a way of overcoming this major hurtle to positive action.  Had it found and presented a means of providing benefit without the burdensome cost, others would be more environmentally inclined, and I would have awarded the fifth star.",1340409600,3,3275,5.155009451795841

8398540,1,B003JYOFB4,"The Age of Stupid (Franny Armstrong, 2008)

Somewhere in the innards of The Age of Stupid is a really, really good idea. But Franny Armstrong beat, pummelled, tortured, and scarred it until it was a twisted, unrecognizable, hateful, murderous shell of itself, the insane stepbrother of 12 Monkeys that was kept locked in the basement and fed nothing but dead rats until it was forty-five years old, then kicked out of the house and left to forage for itself. As expected, it turned to murder and cannibalism, but was too incompetent even for that, getting knocked over the head by a little old lady and turned into the police, who shot it in the temple, putting it out of its misery, rather than letting it survive. Okay, that last bit only happened in my fantasies. Instead, it turned to making movies and The Age of Stupid, a clunky, Neanderthal piece of Michael-Moore-style documentary filmmaking with all the subtlety of a homeless schizophrenic pissing on a cinema wall, was the result.

Armstrong (McLibel) posits a future in which Earth is a destroyed shell of itself. An archivist (The Usual Suspects' Pete Postlethwaite), one of the last surviving humans on the planet, is surfing through data from the year 2008 to try and figure out where it all went wrong. (Plot hole #1: if the Earth went so far downhill so fastArmstrong names, of course, the most hysterical numbers she could for the timelinewho developed all the cool technology Postlethwaite's character is using?) Yep, that's pretty much it.

Before I go any farther with the excoriation (I can't really call it a criticismwell, okay, I'm criticizing the presentation of the science, I'm excoriating the larger frame into which she dropped it, which is atrocious), and with the full knowledge that putting this here is probably worse than useless, in the interests of full disclosure: reviews are not written in a vacuum. I am not, and have never been, a simple climate-change denier, and I have favorably reviewed other works that take climate change as a given. My  record of same goes back at least to 2004 if you feel like paging through Amazon reviews, but a much more recent film made my 25-best list the same year The Age of Stupid made my 25 worst: Chasing Ice. Before dismissing the below as simple anti-climate-change propaganda, at least go read my review of that one so you have a basic idea of where I'm coming from. That said:

I alluded to the film's first, and foremost, problem above. I can't really fault Armstrong for it in one sense, because anyone who depends on forecasting statistics in order to posit a system of belief is affected by it. There are those who say America's system of Social Security is fully funded through 2075, too. Using forecasting statistics is a very tricky thing to do correctly, and the #1 thing you can do wrong when using them is to take those numbers as use them as fact. If you live in America and are old enough, you may remember the environmental PSAs that ran on MTV in the mid- to late eighties. According to those, the Brazilian rainforest was going to be gone by 1985, the ozone layer by 1990. Oddly, my wife is still as pale as ever despite occasionally going outside, and I haven't noticed a sudden shortage of wood anytime in the last twenty years. Armstrong makes the same mistake those MTV promos didshe not only takes forecast statistics and uses them as fact, but like most people who make documentaries that are focused more on marketing hysteria than they are in imparting knowledge (note: the use of the term marketing there is not casual), she cherry-picked the most hysterical numbers she could find. Now, I will admit that it is possible that the extremists are right and the moderates are wrong. It may happen at some point. It has never happened where the environment is concerned, so I'm willing to accept playing the odds and listen to the levelheaded scientists, not the wolf-criers who are more interested in publicity than actual science.

A worse problem is that, like Michael Moore, Franny Armstrong makes absolutely no effort to be in any way even-handed here, which is why I keep using documentary in quotes. Armstrong set out to make a scare film, and she amplified the scare-film effect with the framework into which she stuck her actual (and, once again, cherry-picked) documentary footage; if you were unaware that this was a scare film rather than a documentary based on the actual footage, well, the sci-fi trappings of the frame should leave you with absolutely no question. I am normally of the stance that reviews are opinion and not fact, and thus everything is a question and they can't be right or wrong, but in this, I have to assert that this is fact, not opinion, and that Armstrong telegraphed this without any ambiguity whatsoever thanks to the framework she used in this movie. She meant this to be a scare film. It's the ecodoco equivalent of Larry Fishburne, back when he was still called Larry, at the end of Spike Lee's School Daze, striding across campus with a big bell yelling WAKE UP! over and over again. The problem is, well, that's the weakest scene in an otherwise unrecognized classic. (And another thing I will admit to in this review: I might have rated it half a star higher were it not for Armstrong's kind of obvious nods to La Jete. And the offense that I took in that regard is opinion, and YMMV, and I am totally okay with that, but if you question that this is a scare film and not a straight documentary, we don't have that much to talk about here.)

I am in no way dismissing any of the underlying points that Armstrong is trying to make here, not even the seemingly-controversial wind-farm bit (I've been hearing anti-wind-farm arguments for thirty years, and personally, I find the jury still out) that has been chewed over in various net communities I'm part of for years now. But Armstrong, in this movie, posits the most extreme solutions to these problems as the only solutions to these problems, and she posits that these most extreme solutions need to be enacted right now or we are headed for inevitable planetary destruction. In this, she is no different than anyone since, oh, Constantine, and I'm sure the Neanderthals had their doomsayers, and so on back until the first quadrupeds walked out of the ocean. The problem we have now is that instead of the doomsayers being easily dismissible because the mechanisms they are positing simply do not exist, this current breed of doomsayer is perverting actual problems, and instead of giving us something we can all work from, giving us something that is guaranteed to alienate as much of the viewing audience as possible. I have seen this film called propaganda. That is incorrect. Propaganda, by definition, is aimed at convincing people who may be on the fence, or who are of another mindset and might be converted. The Age of Stupid, like the twin demons of American media, Glenn Beck on the right and Jon Stewart on the left, is simply preaching to the choir, and doing so in a way that is as inflammatory as possible. I give zero-star reviews for two reasons: either I did not finish a piece of media, or that media is patently offensive for easily-explainable reasons. I hope, in this review, I have imparted why this moviewhich I did completely watchgot a zero. Easily one of the most offensive movies I have ever encountered.

8398541,5,B003JYOFB4,"Makes a matter-of-fact case for why Mankind will continue to sit around twiddling his thumbs while Earth burns.  After all, why do anything when Jesus will soon return and rapture the ones who caused it, then take them to heaven where they can pollute it into extinction as well.  That's assuming they don't get confused and crucify their savior again before he can, well, save them.. Otherwise, the movie does not debate Man Made Global Warming and subsequent Climate Change.  For example, Robert Felix and his book ""Not by Fire But by Ice"" are pushed aside not by name but by the science of a bigger, long-settled debate that is far beyond the comprehension of Felix and his equally-hot headed, one-man cult/Moon Landing Hoaxer and Mayan Doomsdayer who has been stalking me on Amazon for about three years.",1364083200,,808,4.840579710144928
