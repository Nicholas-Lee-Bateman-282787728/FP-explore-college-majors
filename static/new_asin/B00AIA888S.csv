8551913,5,B00AIA888S,"I've been a big fan of Mark Knopfler's guitar work ever since I first heard ""Sultans of Swing"" back in the late 70's. The distinctive sound, the subtle nuances using those minor scales, and Mark's distinctive ""fingerstyle"" are all there on this instructional DVD. I even discovered that Mark uses an ""unwound"" 3rd string to help him get that sound, which I previously didn't know. I would highly recommend this to anybody wishing to emulate Mark's style of play. Mr Milligan does a great job.",1361923200,2,492,4.8
