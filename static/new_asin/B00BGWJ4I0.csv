5620890,5,B00BGWJ4I0,"I loved this DVD.  I think the way these people feel in the video is what a lot of others are thinking and feeling but just aren't able to verbalize it or feel safe doing so.  Not everybody is cut out to do the 9-5 for 40-45 years or longer.  Sounds like drudgery to me.  I am happy for the makers of this video and how they have been able to change their lives and do what they want for them and their family.,",1363737600,3,411,3.857142857142857
5620891,1,B00BGWJ4I0,"This isn't about the subjects that are interviewed.  Their stories, which are actually very short statements, are simply tools the director uses to justify his narcissistic film project.  Watch him drone on and on about himself for the first five or ten minutes of the movie and you'll see what the rest of the show is like.  Don't be fooled by the trailer.  Save your money.",1451088000,,375,4.636363636363637

5620896,5,B00BGWJ4I0,"Wow... arrived in my life at exactly the right time. Funny how that happens, right? Great stories, and a hugely inspirational film. Well done by ALL, and congratulations to everyone for waking up and making a change!",1442016000,2,216,4.864864864864865
5620897,5,B00BGWJ4I0,I happen to come across this documentary on line. Just finished watching it. Very well done and expresses what the average individual is hesitant to do. I am grateful for all the time and money these guys put into this.,1418428800,,219,4.5
5620898,2,B00BGWJ4I0,"""I always wanted to be a filmmaker so i started a kick starter project to make a documentary about how hard it is to follow your dream of making a documentary.""

"" I was bored at work so i decided to open a successful business.""

""I was unhappy with my life so I got a bunch of foster kids and became a hippy.""

"" My job was terrible so I quit, moved into a trailer, sold all my stuff and started telling other people to do the same.""

Its a documentary about how its hard to make a documentary about how life is a drag if you have to work for a living.

Next we need a documentary about how to use other peoples money to follow your dream.",1400025600,2,640,3.9302325581395348
5620899,5,B00BGWJ4I0,"I came across this documentary reading archived posts on one of my favorite blogs and the idea really struck a chord with me.  I could easily relate to 80% of what was shared.  This is not a high budget, big production documentary.  It looks amazing for what it is though.  My only complaints would be that the audio on my copy was ""hot"" which sounded distorted on my poor tv speakers, the editing in about 3 spots could have been better and the documentary felt like it dragged in a few places.  For a first time film director with a limited budget and limited time schedule they did a great job telling their stories and getting their point across.  I can't wait to share this with others and I highly recommend everyone watch it at least once.",1398297600,2,746,4.408759124087592
5620900,1,B00BGWJ4I0,"Amateurish, I was highly disappointed with the movie. Had higher expectations as the reviews seem decent.  A pity as the idea was appealing but  the execution was poor",1382054400,2,167,4.928571428571429
8568335,2,B00BGWJ4I0,All I get from this is some dude thinks he can call himself a filmmaker now. Box meet check. Idea is worth exploring.. by organized professionals. Disappointed.,1524700800,,160,4.962962962962963
8568336,2,B00BGWJ4I0,Great message but boring movie.,1493337600,,31,5.4
8568337,3,B00BGWJ4I0,"I wanted to love this movie but I felt it jumped between two movies 1. why they made a movie and 2. the purchase an American dream get in debt movie.  The interview editing seemed superficial (it must be hard for your first time interviewing and putting it all together).  It was depressing listening to all of the problems. Even the ""successes"" didn't come through (Pat Flynn) in the interviews.  Good try and a huge effort.  It is worth watching and I hope everyone is better after this movie.",1483401600,,495,4.52808988764045

8568340,4,B00BGWJ4I0,"I liked it but I felt like it never grabbed my heart like many of these sorts of movies and movements do. I caught a glimpse of Scott Dinsmore and knowing that he has since passed, I wish I knew what he had talked to them about. I also wish they had shown the interview with Joshua Becker. I was surprised that they interviewed Jonathan Fields and didn't mention in the ending how he has an amazing podcast called The Good Life Project.  It seemed like the film didn't go deep enough. I think the interviews were ok but some of the people weren't as interesting as I know Scott and Joshua would have been. Good work, though and maybe make a second movie and spend more thoughtful time doing it. Don't skim the surface so much. Dive in!",1460160000,,735,4.287769784172662
8568341,5,B00BGWJ4I0,"This movie was excellent. The individual stories felt genuine. The movie expresses the sentiment that a lot of us have...however, do we have enough audacity to change the course if given a reasonable chance? We tend to be risk adverse and settle for complacency and safety while taking a risk, being bold, might move life towards fulfillment.",1452988800,,342,5.017543859649122

8568343,3,B00BGWJ4I0,"Good message, but I'm confused. This was like a ""making of"" or a ""behind the scenes"" movie about a movie that was never made?  Or the movie they kept talking about making is the movie we were actually watching?",1451606400,3,210,4.384615384615385
8568344,4,B00BGWJ4I0,The documentary gets 4 stars but the message gets 5+ stars. We all need a dose of bravery dealing with uncertainty in our lives. This was inspirational documentary to me and a good reminder we need drop our preconceived ideas of what really makes us happy!!!,1451606400,,258,4.630434782608695
