1227590,4,B00000IPHK,The was a gift for a friend of mine and she loves it watching on dvd instead on the tv. It is clear and cuts on time commercials.,1336348800,,129,3.642857142857143
1227591,4,B00000IPHK,"This movie is okay, but it's very misleading. Without spoiling the movie, the title has nothing to do with the film. Well, it depends on how you look at it, I suppose. All I can say without saying too much is if you are a fan of mystery and suspense, you will really appreciate this movie. I thought it was going to be a ""Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" type of film, but it really isn't.
I spent the whole time envious of Keri Russell's hair!!! She is so pretty it's insane! Okay I'm off topic, but like I said if you really like murder mystery and suspense, you will like this a lot. So give it a try!

Thanks for reading. This is just my opinion. :)",1290643200,,648,4.0625
1227592,5,B00000IPHK,I would like to give this seller an excellent review.  I was very happy with the movie I received.,1279929600,,98,4.157894736842105

1227594,3,B00000IPHK,"In the made-for-TVer THE BABYSITTER'S SEDUCTION, a dead woman's husband takes up with their childcare provider.

When Sally Bartrand (Lambing) apparently commits suicide, her husband Bill (Collins) hires babysitter Michelle (Russell) to care for his kids on a fulltime basis. At first Michelle doesn't discourage the older man's romantic overtures, but when it's discovered that Sally's death may not have been suicide, Michelle grows cautious and distant. In response, Bill tries to frame his wife's death on Michelle.

The story becomes a whodunit when a second suspect is introduced. Well-worn plot devices get an OK rendering by an average cast.

1227595,5,B00000IPHK,"Anyone who bought this movie thinking it was porn, needs to go back to school and learn how to read (and probably how to put half a thought together). If I were those two losers, I'd be ashamed to admit I was stupid enough to think this cast would be involved in a porn movie. Get your minds out of the cellar, boys! Oh, I forgot, you weren't blessed with brains. For your information, this movie has already become a cult favorite for those in the know.

The Babysitter's Seduction is fun Friday night entertainment. Keri Russell is absolutely gorgeous and a darn good actress, especially considering she was only 17 or 18 when the movie was filmed.

Take off your shoes, make yourself a bowl of popcorn, curl up on the couch and prepare to lose yourself in a really good movie. I especially enjoyed the non-stop action-packed ending. This one is going to become a classic!",1127260800,13,874,4.525316455696203
1227596,5,B00000IPHK,"I think it's very unfair of some reviewers to give this movie such a bad review just because they thought they were buying porn.  I saw this movie when it first came out and then got it on DVD. I've seen it 4 times and really like it.

If you like Lifetime movies for women, you will like this. It has everything: Beautiful young girl, dashing male co-star, an old favorite - Phylicia Rashad from the Cosby Show, and a quick-moving, suspenseful plot with a very exciting final scene. It's light and entertaining and just the kind of movie to curl up in front of in your sweats with a bowl of popcorn on a cloudy day or rainy evening.

Keri Russell is really beautiful and does a good job with the material. This movie is what helped to propel her into stardom. Any true Keri Russell fan MUST own a copy of this movie!",1127260800,21,817,4.258064516129032
1227597,1,B00000IPHK,"I totally agree with the previous two reviewers.  Unfortunately, I got this DVD before they posted their reviews.  I came back here to warn people not to be misled by the title and the rating.  There is absolutely no sex or violence in this movie.  Keri is not such a great actress and the plot is not worth mentioning.  So what's left!!",977184000,14,337,4.370967741935484

1227634,5,B00000IPHK,STEPHEN COLLINS is a great actor in this fine TV movie. He seduces his beautiful babysitter all the while planning nefarious acts. No spoilers here because it's just too juicy to give too much information. Lots of fun and SC is so worthwhile to watch. Good time.,1421884800,7,262,4.595744680851064

Ironically it stars Stephen Collins, who's  been in the news lately due to his pedophile nature. This movie shows a glimpse into his life. His REAL life!! It's only my opinion that he was actually pretraining his real self!! Good movie besides all the hype around Stephen Collins.",1413763200,,383,4.7164179104477615
