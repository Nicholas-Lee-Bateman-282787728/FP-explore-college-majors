It is only 8 minutes long and will not spoil the viewing of the film itself, but will show you the training, the athleticism and the pain these actors went through to present to you this truly breathtaking film, then get your snacks,  go to the bathroom, turn off your phones, refuse to answer the door,  and enjoy one of the great action films of this or any era.  From the first punch to the last one it is literally heart stopping, and for one who is afraid of heights the extended segment of carnage on the tracks of a japanese elevated train line with the street very far below will make you appreciate the artistry of this film even more.  Love the kid, love the family, feel sadness for them in the grips of the Yakuza, but notice how the girl strives to right the wrongs and protect those around her.  She is truly unbelievable.

Premise
*An autistic girl learns martial arts through imitation, and uses her skills to collect money from some unsavory people who owe her mother, who is is need of medication (and was formerly associated with the Yakuza).  Then the Yakuza retaliates, and all heck breaks loose.

The Good Things
*Video quality is almost perfect; it's very clean, sharp, and colorful, with only a couple of grainy scenes.  The sound quality is pretty good.
*Includes a short 8-minute making-of featurette and a few trailers for other movies.
*Includes both English dubbing and the original Thai language track with optional subtitles.
*The movie has a lot of phenomenal fight scenes.  They are extremely well-choreographed and distinctive.  Judging from the outtakes, it also looks like they were made to be completely authentic, and the actors sustained some serious injuries in the process.  Even though the fighting is fantastic, it's also very real.
*The movie is also very well-filmed, with lots of good camera angles and unique colors.
*Production design is good.  Sets are interesting, costumes are good, props are good.  Look out for one or two unique motifs.
*It looks like there were one or two homages to earlier films by Prachya Pinkaew (""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"").
*The storyline is good and easy to follow.  Aside from the action, it has some drama and emotional parts, but it's nothing too sappy.  It's actually quite invoking, and seems to carry a strong message about love (believe it or not).
*The characters are excellent.  The main character, aside from performing so many amazing stunts, shows some good compassion and emotion and makes the character believable.  Other characters are great too.
*Music is good.

The Bad Things
*Not very many special features; it's especially dissapointing since the region-free British import seems to have deleted scenes and featurettes and other stuff.  Oh well...
*Not for the squeamish; contains brutal violence, some blood, and some brief sensuality.

Thailand seems to be pumping out some of the coolest martial arts films these days, and ""Chocolate"" is probably my favorite of them all so far.  Aside from boasting some incredible fight scenes and stuntwork, it is a surprisingly emotional story with strong characters.  This Blu-Ray has exceptional video quality, and would highly reccomend it to any martial arts fan.",1234483200,41,2402,5.160206718346253

I went into this movie expecting a so-so movie with a girl that can do decent fight scenes.  Well, the girl can do some awesome fight scenes.  Using no stunt doubles and no wires, the only fake stuff in this move are the baseballs she catches (you can tell that it's 3D effects there).  If she makes another movie, she could become as big of an icon as Tony Jaa.

As for the fight scenes, there are mainly around 4 really good leangthy ones, with the last one being really long and nonstop, taking place in multiple areas of a building, one inside with guns and samurai swords, another on the roof against a transvestite, a couple of women (the only women who actually fight the main character), and one other sequence that has to be seen to be believed, on the side of a building where Chocolate and the never-ending bad guys (seriously, there were too many, but that can be forgiven since it's a martial arts flick) duke it out on narrow ledges, big street signs sticking out of the walls of the building, and the side of a subway line only a couple yards away from the structure, easily connected by the street signs.  3 stories of 2D fighting goodness, and the people who fall take hits that will make you cring, including, but not limited to, a guy falling 3 stories straight down, while others hit a few obstacles on the way down (ouch).

It's also funny to see scenes from Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong (also great movies) on a television Chocolate watches, as well as hearing sound effects from Bruce Lee movies (supposedly).  It's great in the first fight scene hearing her immitate Bruce Lee's hoowaaah-ooo! voice.  That'll put a smile on your face.

Yanin ""Jeeja"" Vismistananda is good in her role, playing an autistic girl who learns from watching, fast.  She was already a taekwondo practitioner before production, but then trained extensively for 2 years before the film shooting began, and another 2 years during the shoot.  She is somewhere between the age of 21-24 during the filming of the movie.

For anyone who loves martial arts, they'll enjoy this.  Anyone who wants to see a woman who can hold her own in these types of movies, definitely watch it.  And one more thing, be ready for some bloopers at the end credits to show the real hits that the cast (including Chocolate herself) took during the shooting.",1234483200,6,2480,4.85748218527316
3681679,5,B001L67A3M,"I'm copying my review from another page, though seeing this I might have to pick up the blu-ray copy as well!

I impulsively picked up a bootleg copy of Chocolate in D.C. without having seen a trailer or any production photos, or really even knowing anything about it other than it was from the director of Ong-bak and Tom yum goong -- both of which I loved -- and having a female star.

I don't know that I want to even try describing how unexpectedly thrilling and beautiful this movie was. The lead actress looks even younger than she does in the poster above. It all starts with her conception, and she slowly gets older as you see her childhood. I kept expecting another stage but it stops with her as a teen. So I watched a movie about an autistic teen girl who teaches herself how to fight and beats the crap out of dozens of Thai gangsters. The stunt work isn't as good as the two Tony Jaa movies I mentioned above, but it's still quite strong. It also has all the story and character development -- at least for the lead character -- that those two movies were missing. This humble reviewer was really moved by the lead character.

I've already said too much. I need lots of people to see this. NOW. I've been affected by this movie. I'm going to think about it for a long time. Please tell me someone else around here has seen Chocolate.",1232409600,10,1347,4.337301587301587

In this case, the Chocolate is a sensual feast not for your taste buds, but for your eyes, ears, and love of martial arts.  Taking a most unethical approach to a beloved genre took balls, but the cast and crew really make this movie shine.  I don't want to spoil anything because part of the joy of this movie is discovering the layers of love that were lavished on this film, so suffice it to say if you like unconventional twists on somewhat worn-out tropes, or have a love for the action/martial arts genre, this film is well worth your time.

The martial arts in this is somewhat ok. they are some scenes that are awesome, but for the most part they are slow moves. In a martial arts movie, you want to get the sense of power when a movie is performed that it can cause some damage. Yanin is to slow when performing her moves. The storyline is decent, but unrealistic. You will be more annoyed at the way she talks,screams and acts more than you will enjoy the movie.

The more I think about that, I realize that the Director actually did a good job with the actual situation going on between the characters of the story. There are some things going on with the characters that really make you think; what motivated this person to do this? I believe this is good, because it helps the viewer consider relating to the situation. I'm trying hard not to say what actually happens in this film. I guess I can at least give this hint.

3681700,5,B001L67A3M,"Here is the plot: Bad guys do bad things to girl and her family, girl kicks major bad guy butt.

I almost turned this movie off because it was dubbed (Amazon video) but I kept watching and third degree black belt Yanin Vismitananda (aka JeeJa Yanin) is amazing. I was hooked with the skittles stunt. The movie is low budget but the almost non-stop action more than makes up for it. There's a cool fight scene on the side of a building with narrow ledges, and after the movie there's footage of numerous actors getting significantly injured during the filming. This movie is real-fu, not wire-fu.

Highly recommended if you like martial arts movies, highly unrecommended if you need movies to be big budget with good plot.

Update: I re-watched this movie 2 days later and loved it again. I then bought the DVD to rip to my hard drive and there are scenes I watch over and over. Jeeja is awesome!",1345161600,,895,4.512345679012346
3681701,5,B001L67A3M,"I've been watching a bit of martial arts movies as of late, and for the most part I've been conditioned to ignore storytelling flaws in favor of well choreographed kickass action. The 2008 Thai film Chocolate was no different, but all told one of the better stories of the ones I've seen lately. It was directed under the capable hands of Prachya Pinkaew famous for his Ong Bak and The Protector movies. It also featured an impressive up-and-coming martial artist Yanin JeeJa (also known as Yanin Vismitananda) making her acting debut.

Taking a page from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, two members from rival gangs fall in love with each other; Japanese yakuza Masashi and Thai gang member Zin. Thai mob boss was having none of this, in part out of jealousy, and forbade the relationship under the threat of death. Masashi was forced back to Japan to keep the peace, leaving the now pregnant and out of favor Zin to manage on her own. Zen is the autistic daughter of this union, who has an uncanny talent to learn by imitating other martial artists. Now in their teens, her adopted brother who helped raise her finds an old ledger detailing people who owe money to Zin. Well, Zen and her brother go on a dangerous and violent journey to collect the money which their mother needs for her cancer treatment.

I've always been fond of stories with kids kicking ass. Given, it requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief, but what the heck. Though the story is not all that polished, and a bit disjointed at times, I couldn't help but applaud the attempt to tell a meaningful story amid a movie that's non-stop action once it gets going. And the action is quite impressive.

Since the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (and probably even before then), it seems like there's an obsession of using ""wire-fu"" to depict the amazing and transcend the limits of the human body. Personally, not a fan of it, though can be appreciated from time to time. But when I go looking for a martial arts movie, I'm more interested in seeing the raw effort, something that looks real; and it's even more impressive.

Chocolate was just what the doctor ordered. No wires, and apparently no stunt doubles, and the result was one of the most awesome efforts of martial arts I've had the pleasure of watching on film. Violent and exciting. In the end credits it features one of the most incredible, and honestly a bit disturbing, set of bloopers I've ever seen. It makes you appreciate what the actors went through to get this movie done. I don't know how people survived this movie, and I'd be interested to know how it compares with the stunts done in other countries, like say...United States.

Yanin JeeJa, who plays the autistic Zen, was a pleasure to watch. Nothing to say about her acting, but she looked great in the action sequences. Particularly impressive as she went imitating various big shots in martial arts cinemas, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Tony Jaa who stars in various other Pinkaew films, and holding her own against bigger and older opponents.

Next time your are itching for a bit of action and martial arts, don't hesitate to grab a copy of Chocolate. Amazing choreographed fights balanced with a touching story of love and sacrifice.",1344124800,,3247,4.7178130511463845

3681707,5,B001L67A3M,"So I was over at my friend's house one weekend and we were watching a bunch of crappy movies, and on one of the DVDs [can't remember which title it was, but it was released by Magnolia Pictures and Magnet] there was this trailer that caught my attention. The basic story was about this ass-kicking Asian girl who was getting her revenge on a bunch of people who wronged her, or so I thought...I really couldn't remember because I was mesmerized by this hot little Asian girl who was kicking some major ass in the trailer. I didn't really pay much attention to the name of the movie, but I remembered thinking ""Man...I really want to see that movie"" and then I promptly forgot about it until a few weeks later. My friend and I were out at chain DVD and Blu-ray store that specializes in selling mostly used product that other people trade in [betcha can't guess which one I'm talking about...;}]. So anyway, there we we're checking out their selection of used Blus and I suddenly remembered that trailer, but as I said before, I didn't remember the name. He couldn't remember either, but not to worry, he breaks out his handy-dandy iPhone [MAC snob] and he does a Google search for recent martial arts flicks with female stars and he finds a trailer for a movie call Chocolate [not to be confused with that chick flick Chocolat starring the very popular Johnny Depp]. He shows me said trailer and asks if that was the movie I was thinking of...and it was. So we checked to see if this place has it, and not too surprisingly they don't. But another nearby BIG BOX store, whose employees wear blue Polo style shirts and khaki pants, did. So we rushed right over and bought it.

So what exactly is this movie called Chocolate about? My original interpretation of the trailer was only partially correct...she is a hot Asian chick and she kicks a ton of ass in it. However the revenge aspect was off. The actual plot is simple: real-life, human anime looking Yakuza man and hot Thai dragon lady crime lieutenant fall in love, but both of their organizations kinda hate the fact that they are together. So they split up and go their separate ways, but not before she ends up pregnant. She decides to leave her life of crime behind and raise their autistic offspring [dragon lady smoked a lot and this of course caused some defects] on her own. She gets a normal job at a restaurant and somehow adopts a homeless boy who gets picked on by all the local bullies because he's fat and has bad acne. As our heroine Zen grows up [eventually into Jeeja], she watches the young, neighbor boys practicing the deadly martial art Muay Thai in the courtyard of the housing complex her family lives in, and she starts mimicking their moves. She also loves watching old Tony Jaa movies and playing martial arts fighting games. Flash forward a few years and both she and her adopted brother Moom are in their mid teens and he's hustling for money on the streets by taking advantage of Zen's incredible speed, agility, and talent of catching balls flying at her head.

So as it turns out, all those years of smoking have caught up with the hot Thai dragon lady and she gets cancer. But alas they are very poor and cannot afford treatment. So one night while Zen is playing video games, Moom finds the dragon lady's old collections book from back when she was still a mafioso, and he opens it and sees that a whole bunch of people owe her bookoo buckage. So he and Zen go visit these people to ask if they can pay their debts to the dragon lady so they can use the money for her cancer treatment and much high jinx ensues. Basically all of those years of studying Muay Thai from afar pays off and Zen goes on a rampage to get ""Mommy Money.""

So why is the movie called Chocolate? Well the only thing I can figure is that Zen loves these little M&M type candies a whole bunch. Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine. The plot of the film may come off as pretty weak, but trust me, it is well worth your time to watch...if nothing else than to watch the lovely Jeeja Yanin kick some ass!

Okay...so some technical aspects:
Blu-ray image quality - SWEET!
Sound quality - Awesomely Loud! The Blu-ray has both the original Thai dialogue with your choice of subtitles and an English dub.
Extra Features - Maybe a trailer and some behind the scenes stuff...can't remember off the top of my head.

The only thing bad about the Blu-ray is this: If you're watching the movie with the English dub and you turn the subtitles off, they will still pop-up for some parts of the movie. It was driving us crazy...thought we had a defective disc or something. We eventually figured it out though. The subtitles only popped up when the characters in the movie were supposedly speaking in Yakuza, but if you pay close attention they are actually speaking English during those scenes because it's the only time the dubbed dialogue matches what their mouths are saying.

So in conclusion, this movie is the awesome...you should totally buy it and watch it as many times as you can until the states gets an American release of Jeeja's next movie: Raging Phoenix [also pretty damn good despite what other reviewers may have to say]

(....Except that the ending scenes totally ignored the wonderful character of Moom, Zen's friend/adopted brother, and his central, pivotal role in the plot - I wanted to see the father acknowledge him, and the final contented scene of father and daughter include her friend/brother Moom, without whose dedication and persistence, none of this would have happened).
  ...Great acting by the three lead roles (Zen, played by Yanin Vismitananda, a.k.a. ""Jeeja"" Yanin, Zin her mom(Ammara Siripong) and Moom (Taphon Phopwandee); also the too-brief parts of Zen's father Masashi(Abe Hiroshi). The bad guy roles and actors were pretty good, too.
  .....[Hm, is her father's name a take-off on the name ""Musashi"" of the over-rated  ""Book of Five Rings""? (from perspective of some who likes zen philosophy)?]
  .....Plotwise as I watched, I thought at first that the bad guy leader was going to abduct the mom and use her to force Zen to fight for crime and profit one way or  the other, but this was more about the simple theme of standing up to bullies and getting what's owed... I was also waiting for yakuza Dad to come in earlier, but that's ok, the ending fight made up for that late entrance.
  .....The [...] blog site says ""There is a version of the movie, the Malaysian one, that has good English subtitles ...[from]...[...]. I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of female martial artists.""
  .....Some  have criticized that a couple of the fight scenes borrow choreography concepts from Bruce Lee films and Jackie Chan film (this one's locker scene). Who cares - consider it a respectful nod of inspiration which was woven into good fight choreography and story.
  .....Jeeja was trained in taekwondo (good foundation for elbow and knee strikes, kicks, leaps and acrobatic grace), and was 14 when she made this movie. The movie was by the same team that did Ong Baak, and Jeeja trained hard in muay thai techniques under Panna Rittikrai, plus some coaching from Tony Jaa.
  .....The only thing in the story that bugged me was that the muay thai teacher who was running the school next door would have eventually noticed the little girl imitating them daily and perhaps have taken her under his wing... but maybe not, if he was traditional in his perceptions and sexist in his values. [Hmm, will have to look up online if there have been well-known female muay thai practitioners in thailand over the years?]
  .....Anyway, I will now look for more films with lead roles by these actors - Jeeja as well as Ammara Siripong, Taphon Phopwandee, and Hiroshe Abe.
  .....This one is a keeper. Now I have to decide between getting the region-1, dubbed blu-ray version or the uncut, english-subtitled, region-2, (is it uncut? there's at least one version that is...), malaysian version (I have region-free dvd player, will travel :)
  .....ENJOY!",1255132800,2,3076,4.953216374269005
3681713,2,B001L67A3M,"I bought this movie because it was one of the only I could find on Blu-Ray. Visually the movie is great, but after that disappointment sets in. I thought this movie was going to be similar to Ong-bak the Thai Warrior. I was wrong. The action scenes are ok if you like matrix style wire fighting.

3681720,4,B001L67A3M,"For those of you who watch your blu-rays without a reciever or tv that enhances and filters picture, you will notice artifacts in some scenes. Bitrates are healthy but the artifacts are probably from the source and cannot be helped. I don't always trust blu-ray.com reviews(especially for this) because their setups use filters and do not always show the truth of the picture. They made ALOT of  mistakes. One being ""The Universe blu-ray"" was 1080i when infact it was 1080p. It is just how the scource(mixture of old interlaced footage and new 1080p cg footage) is showned.

Having said that, you will enjoy ""Chocolate"" as it has great actions scenes and some great acting from the main lead female Jeeja. When there are no articfacts(only in very little dark scenes, not to worry), the picture holds up quite well. Big upgrade from bootleg dvds and etc. Subtitle translations are just right with unoticable mistakes. Extras aren't weak but limited.

A must have for fans!",1235001600,,972,4.914634146341464

The fight scenes were ALL AWESOME!!! Even the manner in which she ""learns"" to fight is interesting (thought I was gonna say, ""awesome,"" didn't you!!). There's supposed to be a sequel (although I'm not sure how or why the way the movie ended) coming in the future. I'm sure I'm gonna watch that too! After watching this and  Protector 2 (she plays an autistic guy. The fight between her and Tony Jaa, was, well, AWESOME!!!), I became a quick fan. I can't say you'll like everything she's in (not feeling Raging Phoenix too much, the reviews for ""This Girl Is Bad-Ass,"" aren't really good, and ""The Kick"" wasn't memorable. So, I wouldn't say pick up any movie that she's in. Then again, can one say that about any action star/actor?",1487376000,6,874,4.596153846153846
