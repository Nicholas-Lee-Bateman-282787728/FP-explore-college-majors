5369883,5,B009VYAVWI,"No, don't come to this review expecting to find any ""spoliers"". That would be unfair, and I'm hoping others don't give too much away. I will say that I loved the first season of the wonderful BBC series when I reviewed it last year. It had been a while since I saw it and I guess I expected a ""recap"" or ""Previously on..."" section at the beginning. There isn't any (and no, I don't consider THAT info a ""spoiler""). So it'll take even the fans of Season One to get acclimated - only about 10 minutes. But if you haven't seen Season One here is an alert: WATCH THAT ONE FIRST! It will set up the main characters for you and you'll enjoy the story of the BBC news show ""The Hour"" and how it breaks the big stories as it fights with the station's Board of Directors. (This is non-commercial TV so no need to fight with sponsors.)

The second season is somewhat different that the first because it's more of a mystery involving famous people who frequent a nightclub. Throughout the approximately six hours of the series (Ironically each episode of ""The Hour"" clocks in at 61 minutes!) the subjects  covered are  Nuclear War in the 50s - the period during which the show takes place - Immigration quotas , crooked politicans,  the pornography trade and gay rights. (Note that I said this takes place during President Eisenhower's second term. Yet, don't we have those problems today? No this isn't a spoiler either but look for a reference to a quote from Abraham Lincoln (a hot film in theaters as I write this).

The cast is great - every one of them.  Before The Hour 1, I only knew of Ben Whishaw (Freddy) but another name on the opening credits caught my eye too: Oona Chaplin - who, though not listed on either the front or back of the BD case, has a major role as the wife of the head news reader on the show. This is of course the great Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter (named after his wife) and the daughter of actress Geraldine Chaplin.

The BD (and I'm pretty sure the DVD - hasone bonus. It's a 12-minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette where we get to see the cast, producers, and costumer as they basically describe the plot. I warn you. Do not skip to this until you have watched the full six hours. There are way too many ""spoilers"" included there.
To my knowledge they have not started filming The Hour 3 - or maybe haven't even started to write the script but, as a few others who posted reviews here - based on the TV airing on BBC America - I will certainly be waiting when Season 3 comes out on DVD or Bluray.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5369884,4,B009VYAVWI,"Season 2 of The Hour will appeal to anybody who liked season 1, though in some respects it's quite a different program. It's much more of a thriller than a mystery (after the first two episodes, anyway). It involves the culture of celebrity and domestic corruption much more than superpower politics. Most significantly, the plot has much more to do with Hector and Marnie Madden than Freddie and Bel. Oona Chaplin steals the show almost as much as Ben Whishaw and Anna Chancellor did in season 1, and Dominic West gets some great scenes playing off of her (his final scene with her in episode 6 is striking and memorable, and his best work so far in this program).

The ending of season 2 is much more tense and scary than anything in season 1. There's nothing in this season as inexplicable as the suicide of Thomas Kish in season 1. It holds together pretty well.

I can't discuss the weak points without giving away much of the plot. Suffice it to say that I would have had some of the personal relationships between the characters play out differently.

If they make season 3, I'll watch it.",1357344000,8,1096,4.553299492385787
5369885,5,B009VYAVWI,"How can I say how much I simply adore this series! Romola Garai, Ben Whishaw and Anna Chancellor are just perfection! The episodes of the first and second season are so good, I can watch them twice with almost as much enjoyment as the first time.

Don't miss it!",1357084800,3,262,4.346938775510204
5369886,5,B009VYAVWI,"The minute I saw the preview for season one in 2011 this show was on my radar as a 'Must See', and it did not disappoint.  After the season ended, I immediately pre-ordered the DVDs and have watched them repeatedly.

This year The Hour has returned with season two, and I have to say it has only stepped up it's game (which was a TALL order to accomplish in my book seeing as how I adored season one).  In my foray through the world of tv I have found time and again that it is a rare show indeed that only gets better with season two, and this show is one of those rare gems.  There is a reason it has received critical acclaim.

The writing is done brilliantly by Abi Morgan (Shame, The Iron Lady).  It never fails to grip me and draw me into the characters and the conflicts which they face.  What impresses me the most is both the dynamic writing for all of the characters and the fact that the historical setting (this year being the Cold War) is never romanticized, but examined through the eyes of these characters for it's unflattering qualities as it interweaves with the story line.

In addition, the cast is made up of some of the most talented actors of our time, headed by Ben Whishaw (Bright Star, Skyfall), Romola Garai (Emma, Atonement), and Dominic West (The Wire).  These characters (and all the characters) are beautifully sculpted.  Through both the performances of the actors and the writing given to them, we are made to care deeply about these flawed, realistic individuals working tirelessly to bring the truth to the people in the world of journalism where honesty isn't always regarded as the best policy.

Freddie Lyon brings all the heart to the show, as Bel brings the know how and strength to steer the ship that is 'The Hour'.  I have been floored by the cast performances this year (particularly by Ben Whishaw (Freddie Lyon), Peter Capaldi (Randall Brown), and Anna Chancellor (Lix Storm) in the earth shattering finale we are left with at the end of season two.  There should be many award nominations for that episode alone.)

In short, 'The Hour' deserves praise on top of praise.  I've lauded this show time and again to my friends and I hope desperately that it will get a season three so we can be reunited with Freddie, Bel, and Hector at least one more time.  I highly recommend 'The Hour' if you love well drawn characters, brilliant writing and acting, or if you simply love EXCELLENT TELEVISION.  Just as I did last year, I've once again excitedly pre-ordered my copy and will be watching these DVDs repeatedly.",1355702400,22,2555,4.567982456140351

5369905,5,B009VYAVWI,"""Hour: Season Two""
(BBC, 2013)
. . .

Season One had me hooked, Season Two left me floored. This is a flawlessly paced, gripping series, with real dramatic heft, fabulous acting and top-notch production values. As with the first season, the ""big story"" uncovered by the journalists of The Hour seems a bit over the top, but any criticisms I can muster are really just minor quibbles in the face of what is a first-rate dramatic series. I particularly enjoyed some of the side stories, such as the exploration of the inner lives of older characters such as Lix, and the final episode was a real doozy. Without giving anything away, this season ends with one of the most wrenching cliff-hangers I've ever seen and my god, do I wish Season Three were already available!

Highly recommended.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1388361600,,827,4.769230769230769

5369922,5,B009VYAVWI,"I bought the Blu-ray DVD of Season Two of ""The Hour"" after really enjoying Season One--also on Blu-ray. I had seen Season One on television, but there were scenes missing in the broadcast, and the DVDs were much more satisfying. I didn't even try to watch Season Two on TV but went straight to the Blu-ray version. I found both seasons fascinating, so I'm really sorry there is not going to be a Season Three (at least that's what I understand). I would plan to watch one episode at a time, but then I would get so caught up in it that I would end up watching two or even three, one after the other. The detail in the Blu-ray version is excellent, and the story and acting really drew me in. If you like British drama, and I do, check this out (but start with Season One so you get to know the characters).",1370044800,,806,4.2064516129032254

5369927,5,B009VYAVWI,"Watching the first season of The Hour was a wonderful experience, and I was a little concerned that the second season wouldn't meet the same quality. It was a needless concern. Season two of The Hour is just as well thought out, well, acted, and beautifully filmed as the first. Romala Garai and Ben Whishaw are Bel and Freddie, completely bringing the characters to life with all their flaws and perfections. The addition of Peter Capaldi as Randall Brown was inspired. He added a great steadiness covering a sharp wit to the team.

The season's plotline was well done, and certainly less ""Bond"" and more gritty with the team working to uncover organized crime. There are some new surprises with the relationships among them all that are in general well developed and true to the characters. As always, I am blown away by the pure cinematography of the show. Each scene is framed, decorated, and costumed so exquisitely that I can watch the entire show with no audio and still be happy.

This is one of the best shows on television! I urge everyone to buy it, watch it, and do their part to convince the BBC to give us a third season!",1363305600,,1135,4.586206896551724

5369929,5,B009VYAVWI,"My family and I were shocked to learn, within hours of watching the end of SeasonTwo, that ""they"" are cancelling the show. The journalists of the Hour would ferret out who ""they"" really are, but of course that can't happen unless there is a Season 3.  Fans of the Hour know that this means some powerful people out there are behind this vile development. Who?  Why?  How can they be stopped?

As may be obvious, we are really going to miss this show.  The  only thing that would make improve it would be it better sound editing and/or the availability use of good subtitles along with sound.  This is  because some of the actors/characters spoke quickly in accents we don't usually hear on shows produced in the UK.  We had to backtrack frequently to pick up dialogue, sometimes to no avail.  On the bright side, our success rate was going up with every episode, but alas that too is caught up in the web of secrecy and intrigue ""they"" are spinning.",1362787200,,949,4.497076023391813

5369947,5,B009VYAVWI,"While the previous season's plot meandered this way and that, season 2 expands and strengthens the narrative to focus more closely on the political and social issues of the late 1950's. It's a blend of intriguing stories, deliciously sharp dialogue, and the music of the time.

There's defiantly a sense of looming specters to the season. From nuclear hysteria and the Cold War, to Gangland Soho and the Notting Hill race riots. The tension and paranoia spins wildy out of control, with corruption on all levels.

With season 1, the show's personal narrative was mainly presented through the eyes of Freddie Lyon. With season 2, we see more into the life of Hector Madden and the seedy repercussions of his becoming a newsroom celebrity. A particular favorite storyarc of mine was that of Marnie, the wife he's been putting aside. Oona Chaplin was quietly powerful and fascinating to watch as Marnie Madden. An excellent performance of a woman coming into her own.

And without a doubt, the greatest strength of ""The Hour"" has always been it's cast. Dominic West, Romola Garai, Ben Whishaw, Peter Capaldi, Anna Chancellor and Oona Chaplin make this show a joy to watch.

Here's hoping for a season 3!",1358812800,,1200,4.896551724137931
5369948,4,B009VYAVWI,"I looked forward eagerly to Season Two of ""The Hour"", the first season of which I found absolutely riveting, watching it from beginning to end, and then re-watching it.

Although I found series two, which explores the politics of fear in the international race for the bomb, absorbing, I didn't think that the scenario was as tightly constructed as that of series one--perhaps too many subplots suggested, but because of the constraints of a six-part series, left unexplored.

As with the first series, the characters are well developed. The acting, in fact, is is flawless, particularly Peter Capaldi, the director of programming who replaced Anton Lesser (whose character is presumably being detained at Her Majesty's pleasure) and Anna Chancellor, who plays the cynical Lix, and this series reveals one of the reasons behind her chain-smoking cynicism.

The second series explores the troubled relationship between news anchor Hector and his unhappy wife. Dominic West manages to temper Hector's overweening ego with the vulnerability of a little boy lost, eventually rediscovering his long-buried generosity of spirit. Vincent Riotta displays a subtle menace as the owner of a trendy Soho night club (the elegance of which cannot quite hide its seediness), and we discover that there is more to Westminster spin doctor (to apply a term unknown in the 50s) Angus McCain--Julian Rhind-Tutt--than he would prefer the public to know. Hannah Tointon is convincing and moving in her role as a showgirl whose aspirations to climb the social ladder seem likely to be doomed, and the ensemble cast of the 'Hour Team' gives us an impression that we are 'backstage' at a working BBC production.

Romola Garai and Ben Whishaw continue their persuasive portrayals of the brilliant-but-lonely career-driven television journalists, Bel and Freddy, but I am less convinced of the chemistry that supposedly draws them together as a couple, but perhaps that is the point. They are drawn together by their mutual devotion to pursuing the story hell-or-high water and perhaps each represents the only one who could possibly fulfil the emotional needs of the other (I also thought that the charming actress playing Freddy's wife was wasted in a thankless role, since that subplot seemed undeveloped and became quickly buried under the main issue).

Nevertheless, series two still had me wanting to know what was going to happen next, and I fervently hope that there will be a series three.",1358640000,2,2472,5.201005025125628
5369949,2,B009VYAVWI,"Bought and saw Seasons One and Two.  Impeccable acting.  Excellent editing.  End of good news.  As the story unfolds, unpleasantness expands and blossoms. Hints dropped at the early stages are elaborated upon with minimal subtlety. British ruling classes are genetically defective, grossly oppressive and much given to duplicity, childishness, treason, severe sexual problems and extreme repression of personal feelings. The Government consists of sleazy liars. The police is brutal and corrupt. Men are immature, deviants and alcoholic.  Women are strong, with sound values and routinely mistreated by men who do not deserve them.  Immigrants are good, thoroughly imbued with the pursuit of a better democracy, and marginalized by fascists.  Prostitutes are human beings which start out as seekers of a place in the artistic firmament and end up as victims of society and of heartless men.  The litany gets tiresome.  I am not buying Season Three.",1358467200,6,948,5.438356164383562
5369950,4,B009VYAVWI,"I can only add my enthusiastic views to the others expressed here.  This is a wonderful show, beautifully produced, well-written for adults (emphasis on that last), witty, engrossing, and leaves the viewer with fingers crossed for a Season 3.

The focal point of the story is ""The Hour"", the first 60-Minute type news show in Britain in the still somewhat grey, grim post-WWII years - newsreels are going out of style and the BBC is looking for an intriguing new format.  ""The Hour"" is what they come up with, and it is also notable for being the first news show produced by a woman (Bel Rowley, played by Romola Garai).  What gives the show its intellectual heft is the way actual news stories of the era (for example, the 1956 Suez and Hungarian revolt crises) are utilized to bring out different aspects of the characters and to highlight their values and attitudes.

The central characters were all introduced in Season One: the beleaguered Bel, out to prove that a woman can do it and do it well; Hector Madden, the hunky, handsome face of the show (Dominic West), struggling with terrible war memories, a difficult marriage, and his fierce attraction to Bel; and Ben Lyon, the passionate, intellectual, left-wing journalist who will stop at nothing to get a good story, also cherishing unresolved feelings toward Bel, who is equally confused about her feelings for him.

The stories also tell us a great deal about post-war Britain: the rise of immigration of people of color from Britain's former colonies uncovers blossoming racism; sexual scandals rise to the highest political levels (shades of the Profumo scandal!); MI6 appears to be involved in the cover-up of several murders, including that of the young daughter of the socially prominent Lord Elms; Downing Street exerts pressure on the network to slant or suppress stories.

Through the interrelationships of the cast to each other and through their vehemently held views on the news stories that ""The Hour"" focuses upon and how to handle them, the program brings us very vivid characterizations.  As dialogue around Britain's still rigid class system, among other issues, develops, we can begin to see some of the trends that would eventually lead Britain into its next era, the Swingin' Sixties.  The beauty of the show is that all of these themes are seamlessly woven together, the historical and the personal.

In Season Two, Peter Capaldi, one of this reviewer's very favorite British (he is Scottish) character actors, joins the cast as the new head of the unit producing the show.  He shares a past with series regular Anna Chancellor, the older, seasoned, and slightly embittered senior woman on the staff.

Season Two follows most closely the political and law enforcement scandals emanating from a seedy nightclub, the Paradis, whose owner does not take interference lightly.  Tension builds throughout the episodes as we wonder just how much the staff of ""The Hour"" is willing to risk to expose, and by doing so bring down, senior members of the Metropolitan Police Force and the government.  Season Two ends on a true cliff-hanger event, and if there is no Season 3, there are going to be very many angry and disappointed viewers.

This is really entertainment for grownups - the writing does not  (although there is no profanity) pull any punches, and as someone else has pointed out, when ""The Hour"" was aired in the US on BBC America, it had to be edited to fit in commercials.  The DVD does not have those commercials, and therefore has in it the footage that did not make it on the air here.

Very, very highly recommended!",1358294400,,3607,4.885245901639344
5369951,5,B009VYAVWI,"THE HOUR is back in another engrossing six-part one-hour mini-series from the BBC.

Written and created by Abi Morgan, and set during the 1950s, this second season finds the British news program back on the air following its brief cancellation after the controversial interview with Lord Elms.  Bel (Romola Garai) is still the producer and Hector (Dominic West) remains the show's anchor, though he has now become enamored with his own celebrity.

The show now has a new boss, Randall Brown (Peter Capaldi), and he has brought back the previously fired Freddie (Ben Whishaw) to co-anchor the program with the unreliable Hector.

Problems arise for the trio when Hector is framed and becomes involved in a scandal that can destroy both his marriage and career.  While helping to clear his name, Bel and Freddie uncover a growing vice racket in London, shrouded by backroom deals and military corruption.

The fine cast of this well-written series includes Anna Chancellor, as a veteran reporter of foreign affairs and Oona Chaplin (Charlie's granddaughter), as Hector's unhappy wife.

THE HOUR 2 (a 2-disc set) is available on DVD from BBC Video.
