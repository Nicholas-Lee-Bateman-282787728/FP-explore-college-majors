1636290,5,B00005NKSU,"If you don't, this film may change your mind. This movie was a breath of fresh air. The saying, ""it's not where you're from it's where you're at"" comes to mind when describing this movie. The movie is about two Vietnamese children who are adopted by a black couple. The movie does a wonderful job of showing how the family's present day interractions with each other came to be with a series of flashbacks, as well as the complexities of intteracial adoption. Humour is interwoven in good measure which really makes the movie very entertaining. This is definitely one for my collection.
Aside from some mild cursing, I would even say this is a good family movie (too complex for anyone under 13). All the actors/actresses in this movie should take a bow. Bravo!",1004918400,13,761,4.686567164179104
1636291,5,B00005NKSU,"Wonderful movie.  Wish everyone has a chance to see it.  The true meaning of a family movie.  The cultural significants is what really interested me.  The difference in people made no difference, the family was really all the same as if they were of the same nationality.  The characters were endearing and you wanted to stick around to enjoy the fun.  Hurray for a well written movie and a slew full of wonderful actors and actress.  All this, and it was funny too!!!",1003622400,2,468,4.566265060240964
1636292,4,B00005NKSU,"This DVD arrived in excellent condition and well within the specified time.  I would not hesitate to order another DVD thru Amazon. Catfish is a wonderful story about family ties, at times very touching and humorous, from a refreshingly different angle of Asian and African American interracial interactions.  I can relate and love it!",1208131200,2,335,5.185185185185185

1636294,4,B00005NKSU,I thought that this was a great movie.  I love Sanaa Latham.  Her love interest is an Asian male that is adopted by a black family.  He and his sister are sent from Vietnam during the war.  They aren't sure if their mother is a live ir dead.  The sister decdes to look for her and she finds her and brings her to the states.  This causes problems for the black mother that can believe that her adopted daughter is so ungrateful.  Great story.,1182211200,2,442,4.190476190476191

1636297,4,B00005NKSU,The movie is very funny and emotional.  You search for love you thought was missing and what you yearned for was in your face.  But it's never too late to reinstate what you messed up while looking when there's forgiveness in your heart.,1140652800,,237,4.488372093023256
1636298,5,B00005NKSU,"""Catfish in Black Bean Sauce"" is a truly heart-warming movie. It's a story of a vietnamese male (the protagonist) who fell inlove with a beautiful black woman. Apparently, he was brought up by a nice African-American couple. The story breaks the ""stereotype"" among Asian-Americans as well as African-Americans. Some of the characters in the story were great ,and they also play significant roles in the movie. Although, there were conflicts in the beginning,it shows that people of different cultures can live together in perfect harmony (By the way, there are also Caucasian actors in the movie, so it's not just a movie about Asians and blacks).

There are several reasons you should buy this movie:

1. It's entertaining

2. It has humor

3. The story is interesting (not common)

4. Great acting

5. and finally, it might open the minds of close-minded people.

Why can't Hollywood producers make more movies like this???",1123113600,14,925,5.046052631578948
1636299,5,B00005NKSU,Don't let independent movies turn you off.  This one was great.  It is funny and cute and the story is nice.  I enjoyed everything.  This is a must see.,1088380800,3,152,4.137931034482759
1636300,5,B00005NKSU,"i was forced into watching this movie, which is usually not necessary for an asian-american movie. but since hollywood is still doing the asian woman-white man thing (think ""Real World"" San Diego, with the token asian woman), i thought this movie might not be worth the effort, and i was getting tired of the white guy diggin the asian girl thing.
to my surprise, it was written, directed, and produced by Wago!!! (from vanishing son, another favorite of mine because it actually has an asian-american man and a white woman in a more involved relationship than being just platonic.) the story is well-written and the timing of the comedic moments are precisely delivered. it's hard to believe this was a low-budget flick, especially with the excellent cast, good character development, and that damn funny music they play when something is about to get even funnier.
to my even greater surprise, he had a relationship with a black woman! i guess chi muoi lo writing this was the only way an asian-man would get anywhere close to first base on the big screen. and he honestly opened himself up to the stereotypes and insecurities his character might feel, even choosing the foxy, but-taller-than him, sanaa lathan as his girlfriend. it's hard not to like this movie, and it's harder to not watch it again.
this reminds me a little bit of that movie with dante basco and pam grier called ""Faking The Funk"", but manages to be more well-executed in it's more mature portrayal of stereotypes, and in being a more enjoyable story by far. watch this movie without expectations and it will deliver tenfold. the funniest thing i saw was how crystal-sparkly clean the windows and windshields were during the car sequences--i've never seen windows like that on cars from LA",1082592000,4,1762,4.857142857142857
1636301,4,B00005NKSU,"I found this movie by way of ""DVD Deals,"" and what a deal, you really get you money's worth.  What a nice discovery, but sad that many people won't really know about this low budget movie.  First of all, I found it amazing that quit a few, seasoned and famous actors participated in this low budget movie, like Paul Winfield (recently deceased at a young age of 62), Alice Walker and Sanaa Latham.  This is one of the reasons why this movie suceeds because the actors are aptly able to convey a seemingly implausible storyline:  A black couple adopts a Vietnamese brother and sister who are all grown-up and searching for their identities.  The flash backs really works in explaining how these characters ended up with each other.  It is a tender love story between uncondtional parents and their children whose commitment to what family really means endures even the most challenging hurdles.  This comes in a form of a long lost Vietnamese mother and the uncertainties of falling in love.  Sometimes this movie resolves in comic one liners that seemed out of place, but if you think about it, it is a bit of a relief from the seriousness of the moment.  I like this movie a lot even though it has some awkward moments because it is very sincere in potraying its characters so keenly that even if it is not a perfect movie, you ended up caring about the characters.  And don't forget the tisse paper.",1079049600,21,1401,4.590361445783133

I have recommended it to everyone I know and they all have agreed that it's a great movie. We don't get many independent movies here in this small southern city, so I had never even heard of the film. Thank you cable T.V..

1636305,5,B00005NKSU,"The story is surprisingly interesting and touching. I saw a lot of movies about immigrants in America (I am an immigrant myself, so excuse me if my review is a little hard to understand), but this is the best movie ever. I think all actors are great, and fit their roles perfectly. I loved the most the character of a mother from Vietnam. I also liked Samantha, because she is funny, interesting, and beautiful. This is a movie I could not get tired of watching. I hope it gets all the credit it deserves.",1061769600,,505,4.382978723404255

There are a couple of funny scenes and the subplot of the roommate and girlfriend was well done.
The characters are all overplayed and the acting was amateurish and stiff but it was obvious that the attempt was sincere and that the people involved wanted to do a good job.
The movie is worth seeing but keep in mind that this was a low budget project.",1015027200,,558,4.534653465346534

7947554,5,B00005NKSU,"I'll be honest and admit that I purchased this film solely because Mary Alice was one of the featured actors. I wasn't disappointed, and not just because of her participation.

This movie has some laugh out loud scenes, an entertaining (if sometimes meandering) storyline, and - for the more part - decent acting. I won't get into the plot. Others can do that. I will give what I consider to be highlights.

The humor starts in the very first scene involving a blind cat. The dialog is masterful and it grabbed my attention immediately. The back stories, and especially the flashbacks to build the main theme of the movie, are good storytelling and entertaining as well. If ever you wanted to try your hand at script writing this is a good film to study. I am not saying that it's perfect, but there are intricacies in the story that only a gifted writer could craft.

Do be aware that this film is not deep or complex. For me that is one reason why I love it. There are time when I want to be entertained and just walk away from a film feeling good, and this film does that. It could have been made into something more complex and serious, but it would have lost a lot of its charm (not to mention making the humorous scenes incongruous.)

Overall, this is a comedy with a few dramatic spots and some underlying tensions between and among characters. It is not fast moving, so if you prefer storylines with a brisk pace you are not going to like this. Also, if you prefer humor to be sophisticated and drama to be more nuanced, this is probably not going to please you. On the other hand, if you want a feel good flick with some laughs and smiles and a few serious moments to balance it, this will probably delight you.",1446076800,2,1720,4.39937106918239

7947560,5,B00005NKSU,I saw this movie a decade ago and still have strong memories of it. I loved the humor and the unique storyline. I'm all about diversity and mixing it up in life and was raised in a semi-racist black family. It's refreshing to see black americans portrayed as such accepting people.
