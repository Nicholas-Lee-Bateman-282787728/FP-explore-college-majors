7805267,1,6300213641,"Spock's Brain is what people would call a ""golden turkey"".  This means that a movie/episode is so bad it's good.  Spock's Brain is perhaps the best example of a ""golden turkey"".  This episode will keep you laughing all 51 minutes.  It is obvious that the cast members were embarrassed acting out certain scenes.  Spock is visibly embarrassed walking around like Frankenstein and Kirk is practically laughing at the end when he asks Spock how he is doing.",1242345600,,454,4.8441558441558445
7805268,3,6300213641,"""Spock's Brain"" stops just short of being a parody of every mediocre Star Trek script ever written. You see, there are these scantily-clad priestesses who serve a machine that controls their civilization. Once every 10,000 years or so, the high priestess has to go steal a brain to help run the life-support machinery (the brain pumps liquids, recirculates air, etc., actually not a bad sci-fi idea). After searching through the universe, she decides that Spock's brain is the most perfect one she's come across, so she zaps the crew of the Enterprise and makes off with the Vulcan's grey matter.

The episode only lacks one element to complete the ST formula: Kirk doesn't get to seduce any of the priestesses. Not that he wouldn't like to. The males on the planet -- all troglydytes -- refer to the priestesses as ""the givers of pain and delight."" ""We've certainly seen the delightful aspects,"" comments Kirk, appreciating the women's mini skirts and go-go boots.

But all that being said, if you can sit back and relax, you might be able to enjoy ""Spock's Brain"" as good campy fun. The scene at the end where McCoy has to put back the brain but regrets reconnecting Spock's vocal chords, is as funny as the writer intended.

One other thing helps to redeem this episode, though it is legendary for being the worst ever of the original series. The idea of The Teacher, a device that imparts fantastic knowledge though only for a short time, is intriguing. When McCoy puts on the Teacher, the background music is dramatic, as is De Kelly's acting. ""Yes of course... a child could do it. A child could do it!""",1182211200,,1609,4.7188612099644125
7805269,5,6300213641,"This is a great Star Trek episode. If you don't think so then you either analyze star trek too deeply or have no sense of humor, possibly both. It was obviously done tongue in cheek and with a nod to 50's sci fi.
Some highlights:
1. Cool wrist bands which render the star trek crew unconsious. A writer of the Wonder Years had been impressed with this part of the episode and did an homage to it in a Wonder Years episode.
2. The facial expressions of McCoy, when he wears the helmet which temporarily emparts advanced surgical knowledge to him are priceless!
3. The fact that the crew members can converse with Spock's brain which had been previously disembodied is hilarious. In addition, the fact that Spock can move about without his brain is very amusing. Does the gadget which makes this possible look similar to the device used on Checkov to revive him in The Voyage Home?",1060992000,,879,4.534591194968553
7805270,4,6300213641,"Don't be too hard on this episode. It's definitely a throwback to an earlier type of Sci-Fi -- Forbidden Planet and its ilk,  with beautiful, brainless babes who must be rescued from themselves -- not the ground-breaking fiction of the best Star Trek. But it's still a lot of fun.
And if you've ever had a really dumb day, where you can't seem to think straight or get anything done and stuff that was clear as water the day before is now opaque as mud, well, all I can say is ""Brain and brain, what is brain?""
If you laugh at Spock's Brain, check out ""Amazon Women on the Moon.""",1057190400,,579,4.263636363636364

Nearly every fan who has watched Spock's Brain has been unable to sit through it without giggling a little, sustain genuine belly laughs or shake their heads in disbelief.  I have a love-hate relationship with this episode.  I love it for the simple reason that it contains some scenes that induce great laughter - or at least it does for me.  Surely, the creators of Star Trek mean us not to take this episode seriously.  Let's examine some of the elements:

1. On this alien planet men have lived on the surface like savages while the women shun them and have lived below for thousands of years.  How exactly are each of them procreating?  Specifically the males living alone on the surface!

2. Why are the men exiled to the surface and the women kept separately below?

3. Why is it that the women's ability to learn or retain knowledge atrophied?

4. Keeping in mind the relationship between men and women on the alien planet why would such a culture of women choose to take a man's brain to be their leader and instruct them in what to do?  Wouldn't they naturally have taken a woman's brain for this purpose?

5. Finally, why would the women choose mini-skirts and go-go boots for daily wear?

I also hate this episode for the same previously stated reasons.  The whole sequence of events as presented is illogical and absurd.  It may have seemed like a good idea in it's conception but even in 1968, when this episode first aired, the plotting used here was implausible and ludicrous.  Still, because I am a completist I find it necessary to include it as part of my collection.",1036540800,,1818,4.5184049079754605
7805272,3,6300213641,In this one an alien bimbo with a short skirt takes Spock's brain to run a planet.  It's one of those we need your vast intelligence to save our world episodes.  We get to see McCoy perform brain surgery on our favorite Vulcan.  He has to put his brain back.  That's the tricky part. That's the big hightlight of the episode. The hokey scene where McCoy is given the information to perform the surgery.  It would have been good if Mystery Science Theater 3000 got a hold of this one.,1025049600,,483,4.322222222222222
7805273,4,6300213641,"""Spock's Brain"" is probably he goofiest, campiest Star Trek episode of all time.  We've got grunting cavemen, mini-skirted, empty-headed space babes, a missing brain, a mind-booster that looks like an old-time hair dryer, and some of the corniest dialogue ever penned.  You can either groan all the way through, or learn to laugh, preferably in the company of like-minded friends.  You have to wonder what the cast thought of having to deliver howlers like these: ""Jim, his brain is gone!""  ""Why would they want his brain?  What use is it?""  ""Brain?  What is brain?""  The whole thing is an exercise in absurdity, but it's fun, Grade-B absurdity.",1019260800,,645,4.962616822429907

7805275,1,6300213641,"You know the I love lucy episode with the young guy named Arthur who has a crush on Lucy? Do you remember the Andy Griffith episode with the talking dog that fooled Goober or the Twilight Zone with Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson as members of opposing armies after a war? Yeah, even the best tv series have at least one bad episode and Star Trek has just a couple, but this is the grand stinker. An alien in a shiny mini-skirt steals Spocks brain and carts it off to her world so that is can run an underground city. It sounds bad and what really makes this episode so weak is just cut and dry everything is done, I mean this is just 1950's drive-in type science fiction.  A few years ago I was trying to tape all the episodes and when this one came on the station must have had difficulties because the picture was there, but there was no sound. I actually sat there watching for about twenty minutes thinking ""You know it is actually better this way"". There are three things that actually define the third season of Star Trek. Number one is Kirk's stomach stands out more then ever, number two is Scotty has a funny hair-do and number three is most of the writing was weaker and this is the lowest of the low. I think my favorite part of this episode was that Chekov got to be in charge of a couple of other people, that is probably the only real positve thing about this epsiode.",981676800,3,1392,4.2927756653992395
