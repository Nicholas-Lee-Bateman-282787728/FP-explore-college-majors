6242638,3,B00HXEWGOO,"I saw this movie on a whim and hoped it would be good. It was a bit disappointing, but there were some good bits. For the rating, as it is not rated in the U.S.A.:

Probably PG-13, possibly R. Here's why (spoilers):

Four f-words used non-sexually.

Lots of smoking.

Possible drug use by one guy with a pipe.

The bad guy has a very scarred face.

Lots of blood during sword fights.

One of the bad guys cuts off her finger. We don't actually see it, but she grimaces and we later see her hand bloody with a missing finger. The finger is dropped into some guy's drink.

DANGER: One iffy sex scene with a bit of gasping. Possibly Andy Lau (who plays the protagonist) doing some push-ups. Later excercising in his secret-agent base.

And the basics:

Fistfights, gunfights, car chases, explosions, some sexy bits.

Overall this was an okay movie. Not really, really bad, but it doesn't rank particularly high. The plot is kind of confusing and there is a lot of personal drama. The action, though it was good, doesn't really get started until something like halfway through the movie, kind of like M:I:2. There were a lot of awesome setpieces but more action totally would have helped. I have to admit this didn't tide me over until Bond 24 or M:I:5. It is a dumb weekend movie for sure.",1404864000,,1286,4.5
6242639,5,B00HXEWGOO,"this movie has a nice theme and the martial arts is great.  Besides, I love Andy, he is a very good actor.",1403568000,,106,3.8181818181818183
6242640,2,B00HXEWGOO,"Wrong apparently. Picked this up cheap while looking for a Chinese action film. Spotted Andy Lau and some very pretty significant others on the cover and thought yep, gonna get this one.

On the upside here the costumes are beautiful, the whole thing is beautifully shot and they make good use of some exotic locations. The entire budget seems to have gone on these things and the result is a very pretty looking film. The DVD has an easily navigable menu and the special features include a couple of trailers and a making of that is bereft of subtitles unfortunately.

The downsides are an incomprehensible plot that jumps around so much you give up very quickly on trying to follow whatever it is and just sit there enjoying the production values and pretty karate girls. And it's this latter that provides most of the entertainment here for the viewer so inclined... it also doesn't help much that the dialogue is so sparse and - for those relying on subtitles, seemingly insufficient to explain what is going on.

In summation this poorly conceived action flick fails to engage the viewer because of massive gaps in your understanding of the plot, because of the poorly explained 'switch' and due to poor dialogue that is too clever/cryptic for its own good. I'd still be happy to see the main actors of this movie in other films but this is a dud.",1402099200,2,1352,4.6722689075630255
6242641,4,B00HXEWGOO,"This is what I had hoped it would be, action, magical, with a story worth following. Yes, this is the Asian James Bond ""007"" without all the gadgets. The fight scenes had similarities to old James Bond films with updated action sequences. I guess the best thing I can say is that if they make a ""Switch 2"" I will be getting it.",1399939200,2,327,4.2063492063492065
6242642,1,B00HXEWGOO,"Style over substance, senseless plotting, sluggish pacing and overt product placement are criticisms frequently lobbed at mediocre action-thriller blockbusters, but rarely do they apply so significantly as they do to Switch, an incompetent and dull take on western spy films from freshman director Jay Sun. Andy Lau tries to guide the momentum to the best of his veteran capabilities, but there's so much jarring convolution, needlessly opulent production design, and uninspired action in the final edit that it becomes an uphill battle to salvage what's there -- and he doesn't even come close. It's amazing that such a quick-footed and visually ornate picture can also become such a slog to get through, but that's exactly the case for this tacky 007 knock-off. The good folks at FUNimation have done right to the film, though, presenting it with impressive audiovisual qualities for those who desire an evening with Andy Lau navigating one of the worst films of his career.",1398902400,6,976,5.1835443037974684

6242646,1,B00HXEWGOO,"Andy Lau is a secret agent of some sort who works for someone or another.  There's a priceless painting that was split in two over three hundred years ago--half is in Taiwan and the other in China.  They are to be re-united for an exhibition but before that can happen Andy Lau's character, a white-haired Chinese dude who is basically a 1970's James Bond villain complete with secret lair and a squad of sexy female assassins, an old Chinese woman nick-named The Empress and a British dude all try to get their hands on both halves.

From a purely visual standpoint Switch is great success filled with extravagantly staged action and comic-book colors that pop right off the screen.  But in terms of story Switch makes so little sense that it seems to be made up of scenes that were assembled entirely at random.  Imagine someone made a six hour mini-series and then cut together all of the action scenes while leaving out all of the plot in between and you'll have a pretty good sense of what it's like to sit through Switch.  I gave up trying to figure out what was going on after about half an hour and just let the pretty colors and kinetic movement go by, rarely understanding what was going on or who the various characters were or what anyone was actually doing.

I'm pretty sure I've never seen a movie as incoherent as Switch--it's hard to tell if the film was intentionally made that way or if something bad happened to it in its journey from Hong Kong to North America.  All I can say for sure is that I still feel confused and now have a terrible head-ache--not the kind of reaction I'm hoping for when I sit down to watch a movie.  Switch might be the first film that's actually bad for your health.",1419724800,3,1713,4.447284345047923

UPDATE: OK, I just got done watching about 35 minutes of this film.  My wife and I were getting confused, and what we saw thus far, was rather stupid. We will not finish this dumb movie. I'll take the two dollar trade-in that I'm likely to get for this at the used DVD store, but at least I can say that $2.00 is far more than this film is worth.",1424822400,,587,4.140350877192983
