3892685,2,B002AXQNT2,"100 Feet (Eric Red, 2008)

I get the feeling that the story of the making of 100 Feet is actually more interesting than the movie itself. You have a writer/director, Eric Red, who should have been a household name after two of the movies he wrote in the mid-1980s, the underrated thriller The Hitcher and Near Dark, one of the hundred best movies ever made. He didn't however, and he's worked only sporadically in Hollywood ever since. Red teams up with a lead actress with a similar story, Famke Janssen, whose road to stardom was derailed in the mid-nineties (after a fantastic role in Lord of Illusions, another highly underrated movie) by the curse of the Bond Girl. She's quite a good actress when she's got a real role to sink her teeth into (viz. The first X-Men flick), but she's made some choices that, shall we say, leave something to be desired. (Did you see Deep Rising? Yeah, neither did anyone else, and for good reason.) Because of that, she hasn't gotten nearly the work she deserves. Throw in a script (by Red) that's nowhere near as good as those he's best-known for and a few actors who the casting office probably could have done better (it's become a rule of thumb in the past fifteen years that any movie featuring Michael Pare is going to suck), and you have a recipe for disaster.

Despite all that, 100 Feet is not nearly as bad as I expected it to be as soon as I saw Michael Pare's name go flying across my screen.

Janssen plays Marnie Watson (and, really, does she look like a Marnie to you?), just released from prison after a two-year sentence for killing her abusive husband in self-defense. Of course she was convicted; her husband (Pare) was a cop, and the law did not look well on her, especially his partner, Shanks (Snakes on a Plane's Bobby Cannavale). She's sentenced to a year of house arrest, with an ankle bracelet tuned to a large box placed in her second-floor alcove from which she can travel no more than one hundred feet for more than three minutes without the police being summoned. Not that they'll need summoned; Shanks, just waiting for her to slip up, spends an awful lot of time in his car across the street from her house. (Maybe he took vacation time?) All well and good, until Marnie realizes that she's not alone in the house--the spirit of her dead husband is in the house, and doesn't plan on letting her get away with murder. She finds some solace in the friendship of Joey (Gossip Girl's Ed Westwick), the guy who delivers her groceries, but she may not be around to enjoy his friendship too long if the ghost has his way. Shanks, of course, is convinced there's some more rational explanation, but Marnie is convinced her husband left something in the house to which he's tied...

I have finally figured out how to make a Michael Pare movie not suck: give him a non-speaking role. (He does say one word, but it still counts in my book). This is Pare's best onscreen turn since Eddie and the Cruisers twenty-six years previous. Cannavale isn't bad as the gruff cop, and Janssen, as I said before, really is a good actress when she's got a role she can really get her head around, and this is one of those roles.

Where the movie fails, however, is in its script. The people in this movie make some intensely stupid choices, and they do so over and over again. The dialogue tries for witty and fails a few times too many, there's a painfully obvious subplot about Marnie's sister and the will of their mother, who died while Marnie was in prison, that goes nowhere (is forced to go nowhere given the climax of the film)... I'm just touching the surface here. This is not Eric Red's best screenwriting moment by a longshot, which is probably the reason this movie went straight to DVD. Still, it's got some decent acting and some workable characters, and hey, any movie where Michael Pare doesn't suck is worth your time for that fact alone. * ",1254268800,2,3903,4.521246458923513
3892686,4,B002AXQNT2,"I don't usually watch ghost stories and certainly not Halloween Freddie type.  But I like Famke and she does a great job with a not too unusual plot so I gave it a try and actually enjoyed it. The camera work is excellent and the ghost is even more of a menace dead than when alive. She is tough even when scared almost to death or being thrown against a wall or down the stairs. The love scene was tastefully done. The skeptical cop gets his ""comeuppance"". It's a film you can watch again and again and begin to enjoy the finer elements instead of wondering what's going to happen next. The fire scene at the end was scary but a little obvious as a ""Hollywood"" fire. Overall good film for someone who doesn't like horror films. Donna",1248307200,2,734,4.318840579710145
3892687,3,B002AXQNT2,"Any horror movie geek who is worth his salt knows who Eric Red is.  Back in the 80's he wrote the screenplays for two very enjoyable horror films, Near Dark and the original Rutger Hauer(and the scarier, more stylish, better acted, written, etc) starring The Hitcher.  He started his writing/directing career in the 90's with Body Parts(pretty good and weird) and the underrated Bad Moon(some visual missteps but otherwise solid werewolf flick).  Then, well, then he seemed to disappear.  Of course there were some personal reasons for this(check out his bio) and there were rumors of his return to the genre with many different projects that never came to fruition.  He even got a credit as a co-writer on the remake of The Hitcher(a credit he didn't want by the way), but that's about it.  Finally, in 2009 he is back with a new horror film that he wrote and directed, the Famke Jansen starring 100 Feet.  Unfortunately, while not being awful, this new film is less then I had hoped for.

Firstly, it's a ghost story and I don't know about the rest of you horror fans out there, but I'm really sick of these bastards.  The ghost story thing has run its course and the well is beyond dry, it doesn't even have the remnants of mud left in it.  Sure, the angle of this film's plot is fairly interesting, woman under house arrest for a year is haunted and harassed by the spirit of her dead wife beating husband, but the way the details of the plot unfold are either uninspired or obvious to the viewer long before the main character.

Famke Jansen almost performs a one man show along with some very elaborate and sometimes bloody special effects.  She does well.  She plays a woman desperate to stay out of prison, as well as someone who is still reeling on the emotinal level from the years of abuse she endured at the hands of her ex-husband.  Some other characters are thrown into the stew but they seem more there for breathers or tension fillers so we don't have to constantly watch Famke toiling around in her house or fighting the demonic spirit all by her lonesome.  Hell, the cop who is assigned to her case is her husband's old partner, how's that for contriving conflict? Jansen holds her own and is likeable and suitabely distraught and scared throughout the film.  She's so good that I wish the director had trusted the entire film's goings on with her character and her performance.

The secondary characters aren't really worth mentioning.  Michael Pare does show up in pictures as well as the model for ghost version of the dead husband.  Why?  Not sure, but I guess him and Eric Red have become good buddies since they shot Bad Moon together.  He's not bad, but then again, how could he be?

I did like how the film built.  It's a slow burn for 2/3rds and then right before the  climax is blows balls out.  We have to endure some moldy horror cliche's on the way, like surprise cats and garbage disposals that turn on at the most inopportune moments.  Though, the garbage disposal thing is handled well and done better then the film's its ripping the idea off from, so I would say it's still an effective scare and tension moment.  The big finale is loaded with FX and pyrotechnics that really add some scope but ultimately ring hollow when our main character finally discovers how to banish her dead husband from her life.

That's the biggest problem with this film.  Famke's character tries and reads up on everything to get rid of and cleanse her house of her husband's spirit and we go along for the ride.  There's a point in the film where some vital info is exposed and I was thinking exactly what she should've, but it took another forty minutes or so for her.  She is not played as a stupid character, quite resourceful actually, but the obvious needs to allude her or the movie would end earlier then intended.

The whole idea of a woman being trapped in her house due to house arrest, and the threat of being thrown back in prison if she steps a 100 feet away from her home, is great when mixed with a ghost tale.  Plus, making the ghost linked on a personal level to the main character also helps make this one a cut above the usual haunting schtick that we've seen way too much of in the last severl years, but the film's main plot hole requires us to think that the main character is an idiot, and I doubt that was the intention.

I won't ruin it for you, but I have one minor question, why would a woman who killed her abusive husband, abusive for years, in self defense keep wearing her wedding ring?",1244073600,8,4532,4.493284493284493
3892688,3,B002AXQNT2,"In 100 Feet, Famke Janssen plays Marnie - a woman who is finishing out a three year sentence (For killing her ex-husband, Mark, in self defense) by returning to her home.  Back at home, Marnie is now confined with an ankle bracelet that gives her a 100 foot radius to move about, and no further (Or the police show up).  Bobby Cannavale portrays her husband's former partner in the NYPD.  He was very attached to his partner, and holds an extreme grudge against Famke for what he feels was an unjust murder.

Soon after returning home, things get very bad, very quickly, as the apparition of Marnie's dead husband shows up to exact revenge.  Plates fly, as does Janssen, and soon, Cannavale is even more attune to the situation, assuming she's up to no good.  Where the film goes downhill is mostly due to the computer generated ghost that is Janssen's husband.  When CGI is used exclusively to create a character in a live action movie, it can really put a damper on things.

You don't feel as though characters are in danger until blood actually begins flying due to an invisible force.  The only real thing left is the fire (Something the director was quick to point out)... and if fire upstages characters in a movie, priorities aren't where they should have been.

Ultimately, this is a good ghost tale with unexpected and surprising gory moments, and it partially makes up for the recent shortage of American ghost stories on screen, but it isn't perfect.",1243209600,2,1461,4.671875

By far one of the best entries of this years ""Screamfest 08"", Eric Red's ""100 feet"" finds a young woman, Marnie Watson, is granted early release from her prison sentence for manslaughter (killing her husband - a violent NYC cop - in self defense) on condition she wear an electronic ankle bracelet and remain within her home, effectively under house arrest, for the remainder of her sentence. Her late husband's partner keeps tabs on her from a patrol car parked across the street, hoping she'll violate probation and he can send her back to prison. But the 100-foot radius her ankle bracelet allows isn't the worst of her problems. Her dead husband --now a malevolent ghost--is still in the house, where he died -- intent on savage revenge. The acting, story telling and scary moments are nothing short of outstanding. With terrific performances by Marnie Watson and Bobbie Cannavale, this ghost story is not to be missed. Intense, startling and down right scary, you will leave the theatre with renewed faith in the horror genre. reviewed for entertainmentfilmnews.com",1376352000,,1112,5.0162162162162165

3892711,4,B002AXQNT2,"I have owned this Blu-ray since it came out. I came across it at a garage sale or something. I bought it and didn't give it much thought when I was putting it away. Yesterday, I was going through my collection and found it there. I wasn't looking for anything epic, just something to kick back and relax to. It was a toss-up, but I took the bait. Man, I'm glad I did!

""100 Feet"" surprised me as to how well it was made. This B-Movie looked and felt like a theater release. Actually, it's much better than a majority of garbage horror A-films out there that received big-screen aplomb, see ""Devil Inside,"" ""Alone in the Dark,"" and ""My Soul To Take,"" just to name a few turkeys.

I'd never heard of the actress Famke Janssen, and now I don't know why. She was exceptional here. Her acting props were spot-on. The story was fairly original and the direction was excellent, occasionally even Hitchcockian. I'm sure something similar has been created in the recent past, but I can't recall any titles off-hand. So, let's break it down:

Positives

1. Exceptional acting by all involved.
2. Direction was top-notch. It did not feel amateurish or DTV-ish at all.
3. It was atmospheric, suspenseful, and nail-biting.
4. PQ was Grade-A.

Negatives

1. Should have gotten a theater release.
2. Would have loved to have some extras.
3. Subtitles are MIA.

3892713,4,B002AXQNT2,"100 Feet isn't your typical ghost movie; this one is a lot more physical and violent. A woman kills her abusive husband and ends up on house arrest. Soon, her husband returns to haunt and abuse her more. Overall, I truly enjoyed 100 Feet.

What did I like? 100 Feet is a change in pace for ghost stories. Instead of the ghost simply knocking one thing over, it launches dozens of plates in an attempt to kill. This ghost won't just open your closet door, he'll launch you with full force towards it. Aside from that, it also has some genuine scares that I actually didn't expect. Acting was good and so was the music.

What did I dislike? The ending was very out of place. Sure the movie is violent and a little faster than your average ghost movie, but it didn't have to end up as explosive as it did. You'd think Michael Bay directed the ending. Also, there are some small plot holes and some situations that don't make sense.

100 Feet is recommend for fans of horror or generally anyone interested in killing time. As of 7/1/12, it is available on Netflix Streaming if you want to save some money.

100 Feet has violence/abuse throughout (including a very violent death), and a brief sex scene (but no nudity).",1341100800,,1214,4.454954954954955
3892714,3,B002AXQNT2,"100 Feet (2008) is a supernatural thriller centered around a woman under house arrest, who is terrorized by the ghost of her husband.  Featuring the big gimmick of being a prisoner unable to flee, the story has some interesting points, but the premise also limits the story, which feels restricted and predictable.  Plot and character development is not a major point of emphasis, as special effects are often relieved on to move the story forward.  The special effects are somewhat effective, but seem to get repetitive and have less impact over time.

Marnie Watson (Famke Janssen), who killed her abusive husband Mike in self defense, has been released from prison, and is serving the remainder of her sentence in the house where she committed the crime.  Mike Watson was a policeman, and his former partner Lou Shanks (Bobby Cannavale) escorts Marnie back home, and is present when her ankle bracelet is attached.  Marnie can only go 100 feet from a detector located in the hallway before an alarm will sound, and eventually summon the police.  Marnie begins to see signs of Mike's ghost, an angry and vindictive spirit that wants to do her harm.  Threatened with being sent back to prison, Marnie attempts to stick things out, but matters only get worse, as Mike grows increasingly violent.

The screenplay features a number of supernatural incidents and jump scares to try and establish atmosphere, and keep things interesting, as Marnie is mostly alone in the house.  Breaking plates against the walls, and animals suddenly appearing are old tricks.  Another incident involves Mike's ghostly hand coming up through the kitchen sink, grabbing Marnie's hand, and attempting to pull it into the whirring disposal blades.

Shanks, who spends most of his time in a car parked on the street watching the house, isn't credible as a real policeman.  The cop undergoes a totally unconvincing transition from wanting to send Marnie back to prison, to believing her claim of self defense, and wanting to help her.  Completely predictable is Marnie's sexual encounter with Joey (Ed Westwick), the delivery boy from the grocery store.  This serves to get Mike even more agitated, and the ghost engages in some really nasty bone crunching violence.

The ghostly Mike (played by Michael Pare) doesn't speak, appears dressed in a suit, and has no eyes.  His features are obscured, and his look is kind of reminiscent of Michael Myers from the Halloween films.  A spirit capable of knocking people clear across the room, and with a mean head butt, Mike truly becomes quite fearsome when his rage is unleashed.

Like many haunted house tales, the dwelling itself features some unusual construction, that figure into the story in implausible ways, as Marnie finds an open garbage bag filled with stacks of crisp clean cash hidden bellow the floor, and then turns the cash over to a creepy clergyman.

If you like ghost stories, you could certainly do worse than this, as there are some scary moments and inventive special effects.  The conclusion is explosive and spectacular, though rather clichd and not very convincing, as 100 Feet feels like a made for TV production.  While the story isn't particularly deep, the often underappreciated Famke Janssen, carries this movie without a lot of support, and it's her performance that makes the film worth watching.",1329436800,,3349,5.028985507246377

The lovely Famke Janssen puts on a very good performance but the story has several plot holes that makes you ask why.

The title made me think it was about flying in an airplane. Boy, was I in for a suprise! A movie that's on the sci-fi channel...that's actually scary?! Granted, this wasn't a cheesy sci-fi original movie. However, the company who distributed this is The Asylum, and you all should know all about that company. Making low budge rip offs to big name blockbusters: AVH: Alien vs. Hunter, The Terminators, Transmorphers, The Day the World Stopped, The Haunting of Winchester House, etc. This movie, on the other hand, was actually very creepy with its slow burning atmosphere and the shocking gore effects.

Like I said, although the premise sounds silly, the execution of it is very well done, and the acting from the main character is definately something to take note. She's not one to coward down and run away (she's being spied on by the cops, after all). She stands her ground and makes it well known to her ghost husband that ""it's HER house and she is NOT going away"". Good kick ass attitude.

3892718,5,B002AXQNT2,"100 Feet contains a LOT of gruesome and exciting violence.  It's about a woman who's under house arrest for killing her husband, and guess what happens while she's forced to stay inside the house 24 hours a day?  Yup, you guessed it- the evil spirit of her husband comes back to, not only haunt her, but literally *torment the living heck* out of her.

Of course this means you won't exactly be treated to a realistic ghostly presence.  More like a complete exaggeration.  You see this evil spirit simply goes absolutely *berserk* by beating the woman to the point she becomes an emotional wreck, the same way he did when he was alive.  This might cause viewers to have mixed feelings because the storyline is definitely not realistic by any stretch of the imagination, but it's *exciting* at least.

The second main character is the cop assigned to keep an eye on the woman by sitting outside in his police car all day and night, and throughout the film he refuses to believe a single word she says.  ""Ghosts?  What?  No way!""  I won't spoil what happens though.  Let's just say, there's a pretty good surprise at the end.

I guess the only mild complaint is that some of the acting is a bit below average, but the storyline is so good you hardly ever notice.

Overall, no there's nothing particularly creative or complex about 100 Feet- it is what the description says.  It's exciting and gruesome enough to entertain all horror fans though, I guarantee it.",1292976000,3,1459,4.622568093385214

I liked also how the film builds and doesn't show all its cards too soon as it ropes you in to a real showdown.
Ok so this is no academy award winner to be sure and they seem to be pumping out films of this ilk every other week, what is different here however is it's not just about haunting or revenge, it's about survival, even under the most supernatural encounters.

1.  In a house where the ghost of her abusive husband is physically assaulting her, she has a lapse in intelligence and STICKS HER HAND INTO A GARBAGE DISPOSAL to retrieve a ring.

2.  In a house with the violent ghost of her husband, she sleeps with a younger man for the sole purpose of irritating the ghost, thus causing the young man to experience a horrifying death at the hands of said ghost.

They take domestic situations that bedevil us - addictions, petty grievances, damaged relationships - and add a supernatural twist.  Authors like Stephen King know that humanity is far more horrible to each other than any demon could possibly be...the presence of the supernatural just pushes people over the precipice.

Marnie Watson (gorgeous Famke Janssen, unafraid to get dirty in this role) has been released early from her prison sentence for killing her abusive cop husband Mike (Michael Pare). She returns to her home years later by Mike's partner Shanks (Bobby Cannavale) with an ankle bracelet that triggers an alarm if she strays more than one hundred feet.  But Mike isn't done with Marnie yet.  He's back from the dead, determined to keep Marnie from discovering the secret buried in their former home.  To get rid of the ghost, Marnie will have to sever the connection to the thing Mike holds most dear.

Although 100 Feet seems like it's about the ankle bracelet Marnie wears, it also sounds a lot like a restraining order.  Given that Marnie repeatedly reported domestic abuse cases to the police, which were investigated exclusively by Mike's buddies, the comparison is apt.  Marnie is an abuse survivor who has been through hell...and now hell is coming for her.

100 Feet effortlessly demonstrates how powerless a victim can feel.  Mike is always there, lurking, and Marnie is literally and figuratively trapped with him.  Before, his power as an authority figure kept her from getting help; now, his paranormal existence prevents anyone from believing her.

Mike's outbursts are visceral and ugly; when Marnie desperately clings to the one man who believes her (Ed Westwick as Joey), the response is shockingly violent. And that's how it should be.  Domestic abuse is an ugly spiral, and Marnie's desperate struggle easily mirrors that of women who abusive flesh-and-blood men beating them senseless.

When Marnie demands to know what Mike wants, he smears her head along the wall to spell one letter, ""U."" 100 Feet uses a disturbing ghost tale to send a very real message: in the end, abuse is all about control of another human being.",1287360000,8,2216,5.032876712328767

But i digress, 100 feet tells the story of a woman recently opted for house arrest from prison after the gruesome murder/ self defense act against her husband, a well known and liked police officer, whos former partner just so happens to be the officer in charge of watching after her during her sentence. While she is  free from the prison bars, she quickly learns her own home is becoming a prison itself, as neighbors whom she once chatted with now turn away from the ""murderer"" and children are told to stay away from her house altogether even on halloween during trick or treating ( a rather sad scene itself there) as well as the realization that despite the fact her husband has passed on, his angry and vengeful spirit has decided to extract his final revenge in the one place she cant leave, the place she should feel comfort in her own home. While the special effects aren't over the top for the husband, i will say they are remeniscent of the effects in Hollow man, the actress does a trully great job at portraying a broken woman trying to find peace for herself in the mortal world and justice for herself in the spirit world",1258588800,15,1586,4.450171821305842
3892730,2,B002AXQNT2,"100 Feet (Eric Red, 2008)

I get the feeling that the story of the making of 100 Feet is actually more interesting than the movie itself. You have a writer/director, Eric Red, who should have been a household name after two of the movies he wrote in the mid-1980s, the underrated thriller The Hitcher and Near Dark, one of the hundred best movies ever made. He didn't however, and he's worked only sporadically in Hollywood ever since. Red teams up with a lead actress with a similar story, Famke Janssen, whose road to stardom was derailed in the mid-nineties (after a fantastic role in Lord of Illusions, another highly underrated movie) by the curse of the Bond Girl. She's quite a good actress when she's got a real role to sink her teeth into (viz. The first X-Men flick), but she's made some choices that, shall we say, leave something to be desired. (Did you see Deep Rising? Yeah, neither did anyone else, and for good reason.) Because of that, she hasn't gotten nearly the work she deserves. Throw in a script (by Red) that's nowhere near as good as those he's best-known for and a few actors who the casting office probably could have done better (it's become a rule of thumb in the past fifteen years that any movie featuring Michael Pare is going to suck), and you have a recipe for disaster.

Despite all that, 100 Feet is not nearly as bad as I expected it to be as soon as I saw Michael Pare's name go flying across my screen.

Janssen plays Marnie Watson (and, really, does she look like a Marnie to you?), just released from prison after a two-year sentence for killing her abusive husband in self-defense. Of course she was convicted; her husband (Pare) was a cop, and the law did not look well on her, especially his partner, Shanks (Snakes on a Plane's Bobby Cannavale). She's sentenced to a year of house arrest, with an ankle bracelet tuned to a large box placed in her second-floor alcove from which she can travel no more than one hundred feet for more than three minutes without the police being summoned. Not that they'll need summoned; Shanks, just waiting for her to slip up, spends an awful lot of time in his car across the street from her house. (Maybe he took vacation time?) All well and good, until Marnie realizes that she's not alone in the house--the spirit of her dead husband is there as well, and doesn't plan on letting her get away with murder. She finds some solace in the friendship of Joey (Gossip Girl's Ed Westwick), the guy who delivers her groceries, but she may not be around to enjoy his friendship too long if the ghost has his way. Shanks, of course, is convinced there's some more rational explanation, but Marnie is convinced her husband left something in the house to which he's tied...

I have finally figured out how to make a Michael Pare movie not suck: give him a non-speaking role. (He does say one word, but it still counts in my book). This is Pare's best onscreen turn since Eddie and the Cruisers twenty-six years previous. Cannavale isn't bad as the gruff cop, and Janssen, as I said before, really is a good actress when she's got a role she can really get her head around, and this is one of those roles.

Where the movie fails, however, is in its script. The people in this movie make some intensely stupid choices, and they do so over and over again. The dialogue tries for witty and fails a few times too many, there's a painfully obvious subplot about Marnie's sister and the will of their mother, who died while Marnie was in prison, that goes nowhere (is forced to go nowhere given the climax of the film)... I'm just touching the surface here. This is not Eric Red's best screenwriting moment by a longshot, which is probably the reason this movie went straight to DVD. Still, it's got some decent acting and some workable characters, and hey, any movie where Michael Pare doesn't suck is worth your time for that fact alone. * ",1256428800,3,3904,4.522662889518414

This guy blames a character for not telling anyone one her dead husband has come back from the grave to severely beat, and haunt her.  No one would believe her at all.  His critazitsm makes no sense.  She behaves in a very rational manor.  Only two people vist her on a regular basis.  A young boy she wants to have sex with, and a police detective.  If she tells the boy, he will think she's crazy, and never come back.  If she tell the detective, he will have her thrown back in jail, or put in an institution.  Keeping her under house arrest is a very clever idea.  Eric Red is a very under rated director that should be making many more movies than he does.  So many were great little B movies that have gone unnoticed by most people, and this is no exception.  It's scary, well acted, and well directed.  I'm not sayin this is the greatest thing to happen to horror, but it's so much better than all those PG-13 affairs we get.  If your a horror fan, or you just want something scary to watch for Halloween, then see this movie!  And check out some of Eric Red's other movies as well.

For a gore fan, there is a horrific death scene, but other than that, I was just gritting my teeth wondering how someone can make so many stupid decisions.

I couldn't bring myself to give this 5 stars for a few reasons:
1) WHO are all these people? It isn't explained until a few minutes later when an argument ensues or a rather snide remark is made.
2) The characters... I LOVE Famke Jenssen! And I have to say her charater is the only reason I even concidered watching this! The cop ""ex-partner"" is rather confusing! He is one minute hating her with all his heart and snapping stupid middle school taunts and remark and the next saying that she needs to tell him whos here! He's her protecter now! AGGRAVATING!
3) WHERE DID THE CAT COME FROM AND WHY DID SHE KEEP IT?!?
4) The VERY last scene... is she smirking as she drives away in that bus or is it just me? I had to rewind it a couple of times cause I'M NOT SURE!
The movie itself is a good not great but not horrible either! It has an overdone plot with only a few jump scares. The house itself (like the movie Rose Red) becomes a charater in itself,. The cat was unusual. I was laughing as it shot out from under the bed, I was fully expecting it to be the dead husband! But not so. The ghost of the husband seems rather harsh, like a little kid throwing a tantrum and throwing things, hitting people and just pouting cause they are wanting sex. That's one of the other things that kinda bugged me. Famke said near the beging of the movie ""it's robbing the cradle"" and then 45 minutes later she's having sex with the quite obvious underage kid! The scares are good which i like the movie effects are okay. and I REALLY like that the blood stain doesn't go away either! :D.
