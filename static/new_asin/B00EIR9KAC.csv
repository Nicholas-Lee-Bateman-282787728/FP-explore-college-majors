5920603,4,B00EIR9KAC,"Good news! I bought this, and yes, its in English! Dubbed over of course. Most or all of these movies are in full screen, some color, some black n white. Im not saying these are great movies, but I, like others was wondering if they are in English, and yes they are. Ive only watched 2 so far, but Im satisfied!",1452384000,8,311,4.114754098360656

8605822,3,B00EIR9KAC,"I've only skimmed the third disc with ""Gamera vs. Monster X"" (the American International Pictures dubbing), ""Gamera vs. Zigra"" (the Sandy Frank dub), and ""Gappa the Triphibian Monster"" (the same old version of ""Monster from a Prehistoric Planet"" almost everyone else has, with different graphics over the title and outro). Picture quality on all three is very soft with washed-out colors and plenty of film scratches and debris, in addition to the low resolution and cut-for-TV framing that hacks off both sides of the video. If you can get your hands on the Shout! Factory Gamera DVDs for a reasonable price, those are currently the best transfers, superior even to Mill Creek's Blu-Ray collection.

(All three discs in this set share a single post in the DVD case, BTW)",1495411200,3,771,4.976744186046512
8605823,4,B00EIR9KAC,"Next to Godzilla, Gamera is my fav japanese monster movie character.  And this entire dvd compilation feature him!

These are the type of movies, along with the Universal monsters and other gems from the 50s-70s had to offer on many Saturday afternoons mainly in the 70s and 80s during shows like Creature Double Feature on WLVI channel 56 out of Boston.

These films were very organic in their presentation with man made rubber suits creating these monsters showing them battling themselves and causing havoc!

By today's standards they are deemed pretty chessey but the films are fun and bring you back to simpler times--films without CGI, crude dialogue and nudity--much of which saturates films of today.

If you want to see some inexpensive classic creature features, it is not a bad collection at all for the price.  So get out some pop corn and cola and enjoy classic monster movies from yesteryear.",1490400000,,906,4.927631578947368
8605824,5,B00EIR9KAC,Excellent!,1486512000,,10,10.0
8605825,3,B00EIR9KAC,"Although the price is right and I do love these old Gamera movies,the video quality of these features is lackluster at best.",1483920000,2,124,4.681818181818182
