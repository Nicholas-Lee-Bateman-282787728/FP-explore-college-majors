Capulina a cake decorator & delivery man is always late to deliver cakes to the customers which keeps Viruta mad at him throughout the whole film. (Or maybe just a natural reaction from Viruta since the comedic duo where on the brink of breaking up as a team at that point in their long careers together) From the very opening sequence when Capulina is decorating cakes and the lovely Ms. Pily Gaos is singing ""CREMA BATIDA"" a huge radio hit for Ms. Gaos in Latin America (A cover of the 60's instrumental ""WHIPPED CREAM"") YOU KNOW WHIPPED CREAM CAKES & PIES WILL FLY ACCROSS THE SCREEN IN NO TIME AS THE SILLY FLUFFY COMEDY TONE IS SET!!!!!! 3 STOOGES STYLE!!!!! I can hear myself laughging the way I did as when I was a child when I first saw this funny movie!!!! Enter the picture Pily's older sister in real life Ms. Mayte Gaos playing a bride to be that comes to order her wedding cake with her boyfriend. Mayte also a popular singer back in the 60's does a lovely rendition of one of her radio hits ""TE DIRAN"" ( They Will Tell You) and both Mayte & Pily sing a romantic song together ""EL AMOR"" (Love) on Mayte's wedding day. WHAT A FANTASTIC SINGING DUET THESE 2 LOVELY YOUNG LADIES FORM & ONE OF MY OWN FAVORITE LOVE BALLADS UP TO THIS DAY!!!!!! Mayte had previously appeared with Viruta y Capulina in the earlier film ""BUENOS DIAS ACAPULCO"" Mayte also had many radio hits such as ""VETE CON ELLA"" (A cover of the original Chapel of Love) and Pily with ""MI NOVIO ESQUIMAL"" (A cover of the original My Boy Lollipo) WATCHING THIS MOVIE AGAIN AFTER SO MANY DECADES FROM IT'S ORIGINAL RELEASE HAS MADE ME RE-DISCOVER A HIDDEN ARTISTIC TREASURE IF ONLY FOR THE ""SWEET CREMA BATIDA"" MEMORIES OF MY YOUTH!!!!! A HILARIOUS SUGARY TREAT!!!!!! A MUST HAVE FOR THOSE OF US THAT LIVED THOSE DAYS. BUYER BEWARE: The film is not in color as advertised only the pictures on the cover have been ""COLORIZED"" but an original black & white as it was actually filmed. Still very happy with my purchase.",1423180800,,2055,4.453580901856764
8197325,5,B000QTD5XO,"In La Batalla De Los Pasteles/The Battle of the Cakes, an indignant, disgruntled, would be fiance puts a time bomb in a wedding cake! A bakery owner(Viruta/Marco Antonio Campos) and a baker/delivery man(Capulina/Gaspar Henaine) face a daunting time limit as they search for the time bomb in several identical looking cakes spread over the city!
This film starts off on the right note with a Spanish cover of Herb Alpert and Tijuana Brass' 'Whipped Cream' and co stars Pilly Gaos and Mayte Gaos are ultra cute! There's also plenty of side splitting gags such as a tied up Capulina trying to dial a telephone number with his tongue and literally running over the surface of pool water! There's so many wonderful old school Mexican movies that deserve to be rediscovered!",1239926400,2,768,4.915384615384616
