4401819,4,B004LOW1U8,"This DVD has the same format as all of the Guitar Play Along series in that it you have 4 options open for each song:  The lesson, the player's view with tab, the wide view with tab and the players view with pick hand.  You can also choose play along or demo for sound.  The player's view is taken of the guitar upside down, as if it was the ""player's"" view, i.e., your view of the guitar.  While some may like this upside down view, I find it rather distracting and it doesn't really help me as much as I thought it would.  I also find the lesson part lacking in really going over the more difficult part (the leads) in depth.  I understand that there is only so much time available, but I would like to see more emphasis on the more difficult parts.  The song selection is good and I did learn a lot from this, so I rated it pretty high.  I find other companies' instructional DVD's better and easier to use than the Guitar Play Along series.  These lessons are not for beginners, but for people who already have a good mastery of the guitar (know all their chords, barre's and open, can play leads, know how to palm mute, etc.) so if you're a beginner, be forewarned.",1342828800,4,1170,4.2342342342342345

DVD - TAB

The Guitar Play Along DVD series lets you hear and see how to play songs like never before. Just watch, listen and learn! Each song starts with a lesson from a professional guitar teacher. Then, the teacher performs the complete song along with professionally recorded backing tracks. You can choose to turn the guitar off if you want to play along or leave the guitar in the mix to hear how it should sound. You can also choose from multiple viewing options; fret hand with tab, wide view with tab, pick & fret hand close-up, and others.

This DVD features 8 hits from rock supergroup Boston: Don't Look Back * Let Me Take You Home Tonight * Long Time * More Than a Feeling * Party * Peace of Mind * Rock & Roll Band * Smokin'. 2 hrs, 39 min.

A must have instructional video for anyone wanted to nail those classic rock guitar songs !",1311552000,,909,4.3352941176470585
4401821,4,B004LOW1U8,"I was sitting around, Smokin', when I got More Than a Feeling reminiscing about the Long Time ago when I was in a Rock & Roll band. I couldn't get any Peace of Mind, so I got onto Amazon, started browsing, saw this DVD and thought, ""Let me Take You Home Tonight"". Well, it didn't happen than night, but Amazon shipped it quickly which gave me some Piece of Mind. I Don't Look Back on the purchase. Like the other Hal Leonard DVDs, it is fun to play along to the tracks and if you play guitar, the songs are pretty quick to learn. Four stars because the interface could be better for learners with a feature to slow down the tracks. Other than  that, enjoy.",1303516800,6,656,4.2063492063492065

8434538,4,B004LOW1U8,"The play-along while watching the instructor was very helpful, but he plays entire sections of the solos once; it would be a bit better if he broke them down further in order for the player to learn easier. Overall, it is good and helpful.",1426032000,,239,4.454545454545454
