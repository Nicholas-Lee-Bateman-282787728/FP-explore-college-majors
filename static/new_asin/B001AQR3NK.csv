3461906,5,B001AQR3NK,"Wildfire was one of those feel good shows that always made you smile at the end.  However, it also helped with the good cry that everyone needs once and awhile.  I'm just sad that the series is over.",1236384000,5,199,4.2105263157894735

3462252,5,B001AQR3NK,"I purchased Wildfire Season 4 from Amazon.com.uk in a 3 DVD box set which was perfect. The 3 discs were of German origin and in German and English. Very easy to shift to English.  However, while the episode summaries were still in German, one can grasp the general gist (though not absolutely necessary) if you know some German. The final episodes reveal the full maturing of all the main characters and the coming to terms with all the various conflicting emotions that have haunted and tilted this series since day one.  If one were to jump directly from Season 1 to Season 4, it would be quite a revelation. A grand finale!  Any more to say would be nothing but spoilers.  Just one last comment: the viewer will NOT be disappointed in either the picture or sound quality or the storyline. Everyone involved in the Season 4 production got it right, and if there had been a Season 5 it would have seemed superfluous.",1428105600,,917,4.573170731707317

3462313,2,B001AQR3NK,"Although I love this show, I gave it a 2 star rating because it is a bootleg. Had I known at the time, I would never have bought it. Especially since this 1 season cost the same as the first 3 seasons combined. It was my own fault for not reading the description and reviews. I had no idea that Amazon would be allowed to sell pirated copies of movies. After all, it is illegal. I'm beyond disappointed and I fell completely ripped off. $27 for about $5 worth of pirated materials. Shame on you, Amazon.",1413590400,3,503,4.25

3462368,1,B001AQR3NK,"I purchase DVD's among other items from Amazon and I have never had this type of quality on a DVD. It looks as if it was done using a VHS to DVD converter, parts are missing and the cover art is lowest rate possible. If I could rate this below 1 star I would.

Not satisfied at all. Very sad that this is how I will have to view one of my favorite shows.",1394755200,5,354,3.7837837837837838
3462458,5,B001AQR3NK,I really enjoy horses and racing the most. The storyline was good as well. I couldn't stop watching the episodes.,1394409600,,113,4.7
3462459,3,B001AQR3NK,Enjoyed the movie but the quality of the movie was not so good.  First set I received had places in it where there was no sound at all and some places the voice did not match the sound.  Sent that movie back and the second set is doing the same thing.  Don't know where Amazon gets their movies from  but they need to check it out.,1393804800,2,331,3.9696969696969697
3462460,5,B001AQR3NK,"I had ordered the first three seasons as a set so once I had started watching them I knew I would have to have all four seasons. I am a big Genevieve Cortese-Padalecki fan from Supernatural and so I just had to have some of her earlier projects. This is a great storyline, especially if you are a big horse fan as I am.",1393372800,,319,4.0

3462462,1,B001AQR3NK,"I love horses and horse people, but I can't handle the lifestyles of these people. This is what has downgraded America. Drugs, alcohol, gambling and loose living. Throw the morals out the window and do what you want when you want.  It will be the undoing of America.",1392076800,,266,4.541666666666667
3462463,5,B001AQR3NK,"Wildfire is one of my all time favorite shows. I loved this season, but this was a very poor release of it. Lionsgate did NOT release this, this season was produced by AMAZON. Which is why you can only buy it on here and not in any other store or place online. Most people don't realize this and are blaming Lionsgate for poor packaging and quality. Season 3 did not sell well which is why Lionsgate did not release this season. If they would have released it i'm sure it would have had amazing packaging and bonus features.

Also I'm EXTREMELY disappointed that a key scene in Episode 5 Flames was NOT included on the DVD. The scene where Kris, Dani, Junior and Matt head over to that horrible farm to save the 12 horses. That scene is just missing and I don't understand why. This is not cool!

Overall Wildfire is an amazing show and i'm glad we finally got this released, but this was a very poor release for its final season and it deserved better.",1388793600,8,953,4.348314606741573
3462464,5,B001AQR3NK,My granddaughter age 12 and I had a sleepover one night every weekend and watched all four seasons.  I bought the whole set for her for birthday and Christmas.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the Discs and the time we shared together.,1386979200,,230,4.585365853658536
3462465,3,B001AQR3NK,Love this series; but the discs themselves were improperly manufactured. The picture frequently freezes while watching this season. It also skips repeatedly to the point of frustration.,1386720000,3,185,5.888888888888889

3462525,4,B001AQR3NK,"This show ran for 4 seasons, quite an accomplishment! Having ""found"" it 4 plus years after it ran, I think the original target audience must have gotten caught up in the conflicts and achievements of the 4 young leads as they attempted to cope with adolescence, young adulthood and family relationships. The writing was solid, the character development consistent and the plots, although certainly at points quite contrived, worked well enough to hold interest in what would happen next. It started as a horse story and ended up as a family drama.",1379116800,2,547,4.956521739130435

3462811,5,B001AQR3NK,"Wildfire is a great show that covers life in the horse racing business. I enjoyed the fourth season. There was alot of growth this year. Kris is estranged from the Ritters, she has spent some time on her own. The love of Wildfire brings her back to the scene. Dani grows up and becomes a better, nicer person. She still has her flare but its good to see a different side of her. Jean has turned Ritters farm into a Dude Ranch, western bed and breakfast. Interesting move. Matt and Junior make amends restart their friendship. Pablo stiil distrust Kris... its a good season. The wedding theme went on a bit too much but Wildfire finsihes its run with pretty good stories.

I was a part of the Fan Campaign to get the show renewed for another year went on after the show was cancelled.
We sent bales of hay, carrots, horseshoes, letters. It was worth it, we honored the show. The fanbase is still big. Its great to see this show on dvd. Its a great four year journey.",1354147200,,965,4.361111111111111

3462813,1,B001AQR3NK,"I buy lots of DVDs, both new and used, from Amazon's third party retailers.  However, this was the first time I have bought a new DVD directly from Amazon themself.  Amazon states, they produce the DVD's they sale themself, on demand.  Well let me tell you, it looked like the DVD that I got from Amazon was a copy of a copy.  The viewing quality was like a poorly copied VHS tape, and not a new DVD.  In addition, the art work on the cover and what came with the DVD looked like they printed it on a cheap printer and was lacking much of the information you would normally expect.

While I certainly enjoyed Season 4 of Wildfire, and recommend it to everyone, I would not ever recommend buying a DVD directly from Amazon.  Instead, buy this or any other DVD from one of Amazon's third party retailers.  At least when you buy from the third party retailers listed on Amazon, you are getting an original DVD (whether new or used) and not some cheaply made copy.",1353801600,11,960,4.353932584269663

I can see 4th season in subtitles on Netflix streaming.... but not on DVD?  Why is that?

I love the show because it shows about a girl struggling to fit in, get a career in jockey, choosing a guy to be with.... I love the chemistry between Kris and Junior!",1351987200,,566,4.365384615384615

We thoroughly enjoyed it however, from start to finish. It's a heartwarming saga with a great cast, great scenery, and a little something for everybody. Sure...I could nitpick things here and there. You can do that with any series. I had the final season on VHS like a lot of people, and am glad the ""powers that be"" decided to release it on dvd. There are no extras, of course, but that's o.k.

2) You can tell that LionsGate did not want to spend a lot of money to make this season. The picture you see on ""Amazon"" is the picture that is on the cover. But then when you turn it over, the only thing on the back of the case is a very small paragraph telling about the overall series and a small block with copyright information. Then, when you open it up the DVDs look cheap as well. They're a blank DVD (that looks like a ""burned DVD"") with ""Disk 1"", ""Disk 2"" etc printed on them in small, plain font. There's not even pictures on the DVDs of the cast or anything like usual. This is my favorite TV show Ever and I was so excited for the last season to finally release it on DVD, but I'm very disappointed in LionsGate, it's very obvious they didn't even want to release the season let alone put anything into it. It makes me feel as if they don't value me as a fan.

The set almost looks like a bootleg. Season 4 comes in a single DVD case with 4 discs. The cover looks as pictured; a blue piece of paper with a production image photoshopped in the middle and an abbreviated show description on the back. No other artwork. The discs are all the same; boring grey color with ""Wildfire Season 4"" as the header and the disc number. That's all. I haven't watched for quality, but I know the show is amazing.

Thank goodness I already snatched this up when it was still cheap and also that I own the episodes that my father copied to blank DVDs for me back when the season was still broadcasted on television in the 2008 year. But yes, like others have mentioned, part of the episode 404 Flames is missing from the single stand alone episode-  *NOTE* but IT IS INCLUDED when you play the entire segment of episodes as a whole. I have to say, after hating it the first go round, I really did enjoy this season- I loved Noah, who was hilarious, I thought he added a lot of comic relief during the first half of the season against all of the animosity that Jean and Pablo had against Kris for the illegal match race and really lightened up the show. Plus he and Dani were great together. I also grew to love Calvin too- I thought he and Kris could have formed a really strong friendship/bond had the show gotten a 5th season and he had returned- you never know with WildFire- characters are written off without explanation all the time on this show. This season has some of the series' best episodes (fans know exactly what I'm talking about when I'm saying this): 403 Calm, 404 Flames, 406 Friendship VS Passion, 407 Commitment Issues, 408 Life's Too Short, 411 Being Mrs Junior, 412 The Ties That Bind Us Part 1. For me personally, those were my favorite episodes of the season. I didn't include the others (401 The More Things Change Part 1, 402 The More Things Change Part 2, 405 The Friend, 409 Vows, 410 The Comeback, 413 The Ties That Bind Us Part 2) because I didn't find those a) eventful or b) rememberable. Overall, this season of WildFire was the best- there are a few things I would have changed but there are also quite a few moments that no matter how many times I watch them, they still get to me like they did the first time. Example- In 403 Calm, when Kris is talking to Dani about how she didn't think it'd be as hard as it turned out to be for her to return to RainTree or in 407 Commitment Issues when Jean finally realizes that RainTree needs to be back in racing- fans had waited all season long for that moment and the payoff is fantastic. I have tears streaming down my face, every time- no fail. Great, great season, the best out of the four that were produced. The writers went ahead and truly did save the best for last.",1316995200,,2491,4.34549356223176

Like ALL TV and movies, sometimes things aren't exactly as I would have written it to be, but then, I not only didn't offer my ideas, I wasn't asked.  In the end, I was entertained by the series!  MORE IMPORTANTLY to me now is I want to get the final season released on DVD in order to complete my collection.  I sincerely despise having to wait YEARS in order to complete my own collection of the series.  The other seasons were released on DVD almost instantaneously ... why the stall in releasing the end of this series?!?!?!?",1300233600,4,561,4.355769230769231
3463038,1,B001AQR3NK,"I seriously don't get how people brilliant enough to come up with a show like Wildfire could be so bad at wrapping it up. It started being dumb during the last episode of season three. If it was REALLY necessary for Kris to leave Raintree, which already seemed to be jumping the shark, there are a million smarter ways to do it than making Jean kick her out for trying to save the ranch. How does that even remotely make sense when in the previous episode she told Kris that she felt like a daughter to her? And Pablo saying, ""when you stole this horse you turned back the clock"" was just plain mean. And it makes no sense that Junior and Jillian didn't work out. They had tons in common, they would have been GREAT together. The worst part of all was that it ended with Kris having the most romantic wedding in the world to THE WRONG GUY. ESPECIALLY when the last few eipsodes were clearly showing that everything was against them and then they suddenly got married anyway. It makes no sense for Kris to marry Junior. Matt is so much better for her in every way. He's sweet, he's sensetive, he's hot, he's been in love with her since the beginning of season one, he's the son of the owner of the ranch that Kris is already part of (when in season two she felt bad just riding for the Davis's), did I mention he's HOT?",1298419200,3,1318,4.276

3463043,4,B001AQR3NK,"Like the last season of Ugly Betty, the first half of Wildfire's 4th season was clearly going in a different direction before it was cancelled and they hastily had to wind it up.  Unlike Betty, Wildfire put the last half of this season to use in bringing things to a close instead of dragging things out to rush the last ep.

Pablo, the ex-con, and Jean, who cheated on her accountant b/f with her gambling addict ex, were way too judgemental at Chris.  I know it's on the family channel so the moral beats story at times, but come on.  However, by costing Chris her license they really wrote themselves into a corner and deux machina fixed it.  Also the clean up of Chris' ex-agent and ex-b/f was way too easy.  You can tell they knew the show was probably a goner given that a lot of the supporting cast (agent Kerry, Matt's little brother, and Danni's drug dealing ex b/f who was shaping up) were all gone as were a lot of the side stories.  I wanted to see Danni find her mom, but Junior found his and then she vanished.  Also wanted to see Tina Sharp get hers and didn't.  Plus there was that whole Pablo working undercover thing that was dropped.  They were trying to wrap things up and I appreciated it, but it wasn't perfect.

My only real gripe is that the Matt/Chris/Junior triangle really never got the full treatment.  Chris was warned off Matt and went to Junior for 5 minutes before she was ordered to be loyal to Raintree and dump Junior.  Ok.  Then she was back on with Junior almost, until she wanted the agent.  Then she went to Matt and I still fail to see why everyone was against them.  It was a perfect fit since they were team Raintree.  Given that she lived in Matt's room, I expected more of him trying to get her back and more jealousy when she went to Junior than we got.  Heck, Matt should have gone to Danni, his original love interest, but he got no one and she went to a random vet.

It was clear they were trying to leave things open if the show got picked up while also trying to give it an ending.  I cannot believe they canceled Wildfire a show with good stories, good writing and good acting to do Secret Life which has clunky writing and even clunkier acting.  I assume the insurance premiums got too high on a show with horses, and if you don't know racing, Wildfire's career was pretty much done when he was 5 and he missed all the big races by starting at 4 as you have to be 3 to do the Triple Crown.",1277683200,32,2441,4.240259740259741

3463045,2,B001AQR3NK,"SO I love the show. But, Lionsgate put no energy whatsoever into the DVD. I don't mind that the DVD's look cheap. I don't mind the packaging. But be aware that on Disk 2, the episode Flames is missing a large segment about 10 minutes worth. That whole one where Jr comes in with money to buy Flame and the group of them take off to go get him. I tried multiple DVD players to make sure it wasn't me. It wasn't. I am beyond disappointed after waiting years to get the DVD's in the first place. I requested a replacement from Amazon and the same is true again with the new copy. If I hadn't wait so long to get it or could have bought it through anyone else I would have sent it back. I guess I'll have to pray Hulu never takes down the episodes.
