8415922,2,B004478BR4,"The delivery of my dvd was on time, however I was disappointed in the content. It was different from the tv version.  This was not the full version I saw on TV.  They left out many segments of the documentary that I thought were quite relevant.  I missed the indept discussion with the Pastor on tithing and his church's finance.  Also it did not show the town hall meeting with Bishop Jakes and Reverend Deforest Soaries.  I would like to know if there is a second part or missing DVD because this was clearly not the full version.",1319760000,,532,4.387755102040816
8415923,5,B004478BR4,"This product is of interest to me because I teach personal finance and investment classes to mostly young Generation Y African Americans, but also Boomers.  I also have presented workshops/seminars on personal finance to faith groups and others.  This video has something for most audiences interested in this topic and shows what is being done to address personal financial literacy in one community by a passionate faith/church leader.  I find it is very helpful in reinforcing discussions around debt, college and career planning, and the current financial recession's impact on African American families.",1300060800,,608,5.516129032258065
8415924,1,B004478BR4,"I think all of these issues referenced at the beginning of the amazon book synopsis are more and more becoming individual stories.  I'm not saying that this book will contain incorrect numbers, but we could take a huge bucket of people that have been adversely affected by the recession and draw many conclusions.  Rural versus Urban, blue versus red, men versus women, college educated with debt versus no college education but no school debt.....the list goes on.

My verbose point is that this book makes a tired and likely erroneous conclusion from a table of 4 or 5 statistics.  These are individual stories....someone having their house foreclosed upon, someone collecting unemployment for 18 months, someone buying a home, someone not buying a home, someone working to attain a college education, someone not targeting a college degree as a goal.....these are all just stories about americans...not african americans or asian americans or european americans or latin americans.

Moreover, it is dangerous to build a book around anybody in the pulpit nowadays.  Just like congress...an unbelievably high ratio of hate mongers, crooks, idiots and essentially people that are just self serving, have and are currently serving in that capacity.  This guy may be genuine, but so were all the ""rest"" of them.",1288915200,,1309,5.204761904761905
8415925,1,B004478BR4,"I for one am sick to death of this racial crap.  EVERYBODY is having a hard time right now regardless of color, and to single out a color is idiotic.

For all of us out here who are middle class, and perhaps a bit lower who have purchased a home, and then lost their jobs, color has little relevance.  I WISH that I could blame everything that was bad in my life as being a direct result of my skin color.  It would be much easier if I could blame others for the crappy stuff that I have to deal with financially instead of my personal spending choices.  No, this book is a sham, and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.",1288742400,5,628,4.114754098360656
