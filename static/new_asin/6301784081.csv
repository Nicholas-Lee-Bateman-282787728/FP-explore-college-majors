7814919,5,6301784081,"This video is a wonderful snapshot of Capra's tremendous contribution to the art of American filmmaking.  You'll enjoy clips from Capra's classics ""It Happened One Night,"" ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" ""You Can't Take it With You,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" among others.  Host Jimmy Stewart does a wonderful job of honoring this one-of-a-kind director with humor and humility.  Stars of Capra's films who make appearances and reminisce include Donna Reed and Claudette Colbert.  Frank Capra's acceptance speech at the end of the video has all the elements of a Capra film...humor, sincerity, and inspiration.  This video is a must-have for fans of Capra, and fans of great classic films.  It is entertaining and endearing enough to be watched and enjoyed again and again.",1009843200,6,803,5.138461538461539
