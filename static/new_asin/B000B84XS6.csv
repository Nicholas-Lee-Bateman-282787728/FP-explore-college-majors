In the last couple of years I've started to add other types of workouts, such as strength and also cardio type programs like kickboxing.

Okay, that being said let me get to the product at hand.

Power 90 Sculpt 1-2 as well as the rest of the Power 90 workouts are really very simple and straighforward circuits.

Sculpt 1-2 (like 3-4) starts with a short warm up and then moves into a series of strength exercises based on this formula: Chest,Back, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Legs.

All the chest moves are pushups, the legs are primarily lunges, squats or combinations, and the other exercises use either resistance bands or dumbells. So you really need very little equiptment (or even much floor space) for them. I recently purchased the power 90 set for one of my brothers and it included a resistance band for free.

The set is very simple, just Tony Horton who designed and leads the workouts, and a female and male exerciser.

Tony is definitely a character, who keeps things light while he works you hard!

If you commit to doing this workout (meaning the whole power 90 set, progressing to the 3-4 Sculpt and Sweat-Cardio-Ab ripper programs, AND you follow their nutrition recommendations, you will definitely get results.

This isn't a magic bullet type program, you really work your [...] off, but that's why it works! :)

I'm a fan of the Beachbody programs and have several. I actually started with P90X because I was a pretty advanced exerciser, but for most folks I recommend doing Power 90 first, then moving either directly on to P90X or even better the Power 90 Masters series (my overall favorite of the three).

The Power Half Hour Series is another very good set of programs. Even though they are only 30 minutes, they are actually very intense and pack a lot of punch.

They are also more body part specific focusing on either the Upper Body, Thighs, Buns, or Abs (which is a combination of Cardio and Ab work, VERY good) and then there's a stretch program as well.",1195948800,3,2176,4.638020833333333
