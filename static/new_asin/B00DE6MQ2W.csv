8592469,4,B00DE6MQ2W,I enjoyed this DVD.  It's just sad that the songs do not give you subtitles unlike their full movies.  I have seen many Bollywood movies but I do not understand the language so I rely on the subtitles.  I enjoyed the songs though and just try to remember what its all about.,1506643200,,274,4.230769230769231
