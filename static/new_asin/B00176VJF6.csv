3167625,4,B00176VJF6,"Ann Andrews wrote a book about her ""indigo son,"" who she firmly believes has been abducted numerous times by aliens and has tremendous psychic abilities. This DVD chronicles the story. It's a trip!",1216425600,,197,5.0
3167626,5,B00176VJF6,"The events chronicled in the entertaining and intriguing true story are difficult to dispute.  The almost alien possession that occurs at the Hawknest Farm is so scary and compelling, especially in the birthday scene.  The personal interviews with Anne really explain the detail and fear involving the abductions of Anne and Jason.  You really feel for Anne as she describes how it feels to have people/police refuse to believe what was happening.  This DVD serves almost as vindication for Anne.  This is very well done and well worth your time.  Highly recommended.",1214352000,2,567,5.108695652173913
3167627,3,B00176VJF6,"This DVD is a follow-up to the book of the same title, written by Ann Andrews about her ""indigo"" son. She asserts that he is a powerful psychic who has been abducted multiple times by aliens. The DVD provides a live interview with the players in this extraordinary story.",1213833600,,271,4.551020408163265

8265077,1,B00176VJF6,Terribly edited & not well told.,1450310400,,32,4.5
8265078,5,B00176VJF6,Excellent insight into this family's experience. Very engaging and honest.,1422921600,,74,6.5
8265079,5,B00176VJF6,"What Ann & Jason have been through & continue to face seems difficult to believe on paper--but once you see these people first hand, you can really feel that what they are saying is the truth & is PROFOUND. Their experience is a shared one, which lends credibility even further. They may be claiming extraterrestrial origins (and after watching this, that is entirely believable) but what I really felt was the humanity of their situation. How difficult it all must be! They are two brave people & I'm glad their story is being told.",1374883200,,533,4.680851063829787
8265080,5,B00176VJF6,For those not familiar with indigo children this video will be quite shocking I'm sure. I know I was stunned. I'd hate to ruin the dvd for you but I will say that it is definitely worth the time and money. I've been thinking about this dvd for days.,1374883200,,249,4.1020408163265305
8265081,1,B00176VJF6,"Ok, I am into this stuff but, I have never seen a movie so poorly put together. It was mostly the mother talking about her son.
Im not sure what her motive was except maybe to have few of her own 2 min. of fame??? I kept waiting for it to get better but, it did not. poor sound quality, poor picture quality. Very little content.",1357084800,,329,4.0
8265082,3,B00176VJF6,"It was interesting but, poorly put together. It just could have been so much better. It was hard to hear or comprehend what the mom was saying at times. Some of the footage wasn't clear as to what was going on etc. And it wasn't clear what the intent of the movie was. More like random peices thrown together.",1350345600,,309,4.254237288135593
8265083,1,B00176VJF6,"This documentary has a terrible sound track- music coupled with English dialog- hardly hear it. The story is about Jason- a supposedly ""Indigo"" child- Had little to do with it. Jason was a very interesting person and the story could have been really very good- if the interviews had been orchestrated with more than mediocre questioning and answers. For a person who has spent over 30 years in the field of Metaphysics- I found this to be one of my worst experiences!",1283126400,,467,4.7073170731707314
8265084,2,B00176VJF6,"First of all I went into this with a very open mind. I was expecting to hear some out of this world stuff but instead what I got was this lady talking about why she thinks her son is special for like 45 min and then the rest is taken up by her son saying he is not special, He did seem to be genuine but the mother has that annoying attitude many mothers display when talking about their kids. To be fair they do share some interesting info but its only like 5 min worth to me.",1274572800,9,477,3.877551020408163
8265085,2,B00176VJF6,"There are places where the quality of the recorded voice of the interview cannot easily be heard.  It sounds like the interviewer used a real cheap cassette deck that had dirty heads, and in production a decision was made to cover the poor quality with cheesy D-Flat-Minor music, fading in so loud in parts that the speech is drowned out.  As far as content, little or no substantiation is offered for their assertions.  That said, I don't regret buying it.  I'm happy to see any possible documentation of extra-dimensions, etc.  But if your going to interview a person, for goodness sake, use at least a medium quality microphone!",1269216000,,631,4.805555555555555
8265086,3,B00176VJF6,"I thought the content was fascinating.  However, all that loud noise at the beginning of each DVD produced by the company is irritating and unnecessary.  It was ""home movie"" quality and I had difficulty hearing what was said.  I recommend this just for the content.  Maybe reading the book would be a better choice though.",1228003200,5,322,4.8
