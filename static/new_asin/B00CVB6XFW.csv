5742306,4,B00CVB6XFW,"I dub this an enjoyable cavalry potboiler and might watch it again. The plot is okay, but not great. Two different girls love Guy Madison, who must chose between the colonel's daughter (who choses him over fellow officer Rory Calhoun) or the beautiful widow from the same side of the tracks he grew up on. When he choses the widow, who is tough, likeable, and much more interesting than the colonel's daughter, tragedy strikes when Madison's former friends don't understand. The Guy Madison and actress who played the widow have extremely good stage presence and chemistry.",1373673600,12,573,4.979166666666667
5742307,4,B00CVB6XFW,I liked the movie and have always liked guy madison and rory calhoun as actors. It was a good western that kept your attention.,1371513600,9,127,4.333333333333333
8586710,5,B00CVB6XFW,"Great old movie with the glorious Guy Madison and Rory Calhoun, both so incredibly good looking with their lives and careers ahead of them.  Guy was a much better actor than he got credit for.  Carole Matthews was great as the fallen and redeemed woman.  More of a cowboy love story than a western.  I wish it had been filmed in color.  Enjoyable though.",1522540800,,354,4.46875
8586711,3,B00CVB6XFW,A good western and how can you go wrong with Madison and Calhoun in the same pic.,1502582400,,81,3.823529411764706
8586712,2,B00CVB6XFW,"Always a fan of Guy Madison and Rory Calhoun. This venture was one of the first of them starting out in Westerns. It is interesting to see
when Guy leaves the Army in the middle. Notice the gun and holster set he puts on, it is the same set only with the guns reversed he wore'
while playing Wild Bill Hickok.
The movie itself was a good story but not well played out. Both got better as their careers went on. Steve Brodie the main baddie, gets killed midway through and was as mean as milktoast. His female partner had more spunk and knowledge along with being more dangerous.",1501718400,,578,4.3119266055045875
8586713,2,B00CVB6XFW,Not very good. I've always liked both of the starring actors but this was not one of their best.,1411776000,,96,4.105263157894737
8586714,3,B00CVB6XFW,not enough action as the 2 stars are to involved in their personal lives. still retains interest  and maintains your mind as to what wiil happen  regards ken,1388188800,2,157,4.571428571428571
8586715,3,B00CVB6XFW,this was a slow moving movie but it was okay Ihave watched better calvery movie s like all john waynes,1387584000,,102,4.15
8586716,2,B00CVB6XFW,"Did not like story line, and lack of action I was expecting from reviews provided.  Like Calhoun and Madison, but not in this one.",1381795200,5,130,4.416666666666667
8586717,3,B00CVB6XFW,"You would think a 1951 Allied Artists western starring Madison/Calhoun and Carole Matthews, and with a title like this would be  a rousing Cavalry vs Indians semi epic-Would you not? You will be disapointed if you do. Now I love westerns, have done for 50 years or more, and I seldom find one that I can't find anything to like. At least this has Carole Matthews as ""hostess with a heart of stone/gold"", but action it does not have until the final 10' or so (of a 77' film), and even then it is badly handled by director John Rawlins, as indeed he mishandles  most of the film. Neither Madison or Calhoun, both to become good action/western stars, seem at home here, and haven't quite found their persona. Of course it's not all bad, fine photography and an excellent b/w 4.3 print, and I guess if you are a fan and completist of Rory and Guy then you will have to get this regardless of what I say. A word of warning - Do not look closely at the photos on the back cover of the Warner Archive DVD - A bit of a Spoiler, and the plot description is misleading. I take little pleasure in writing this, but I hope it may help those in doubt.",1379289600,17,1138,4.23963133640553
8586718,5,B00CVB6XFW,This is a story about the Indians and the calvary in the west so if you enjoy these kind of movies you will enjoy this one even if it does start a little slow.,1376352000,8,159,3.7058823529411766
8586719,3,B00CVB6XFW,Guy Madison was in another western movie that I wish would be released CHARGE AT FEATHER RIVER! This was almost as good!,1374796800,2,120,4.5
