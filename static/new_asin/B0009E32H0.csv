8059307,5,B0009E32H0,"Before his death, Gutzon Borglum claimed ""I am allowing extra three inches on all the features, one inch for every one hundred thousand years, in another word the work will not be done in three hundred thousand years."" Mr. Borglum was a visionary, an artist who created an art work for centuries to come with the help of a congressman with cancer who did everything to bring his dream into reality. This is the story of America, its proud citizens and legislators. They really put today's legislators into shame who can hardly show any accomplishments. A must see documentary. Bravo.",1420329600,,583,4.84

8059312,3,B0009E32H0,"Prior to our trip to Mt. Rushmore, our family purchased this video and the History Channel video about Mt. Rushmore.  The PBS video is okay, but I believe the History Channel video to be the better fo the two.",1252108800,4,209,4.358974358974359
8059313,3,B0009E32H0,"I am always fascinated by what the American Experience series chooses to cover.  At first, I thought this would just be about a monument, but it's much more about the man behind it.

Mount Rushmore was born of historical circumstances.  South Dakotan (white only? Why are the Lakota absent from this documentary?) men needed jobs.  The Dust Bowl and the Great Depression were taking place.  Often the rock was too porous and had to be resculpted.

I love the way the AE series covers America, warts and all.  This piece said that the sculptor Borglum was xenophobic, racist, and anti-Jewish, on top of being an egomaniac.  It said he choose Theodore Roosevelt just because he was a friend.  Clearly I'm not placing this guy in my list of heroes.

I enjoyed other works in the series MUCH more than this one.  However, if you want to know a bit more about Mount Rushmore, than why not peep this documentary?",1121040000,7,906,4.635220125786163
