2873358,5,B000RPD0IM,"This a great Cowboys' Super Bowl DVD set.  I have the other Dallas Super Bowl DVD and this one is different than that one.  It does not include the official NFL Super Bowl film that everyone is used to seeing.  It covers each of the specific championship seasons (entire season and not just the Super Bowl, 45 minutes or so each) and includes player interviews and insight.  I was very happy with the DVD and it makes a great addition to my Dallas Cowboys DVD library.",1212624000,2,468,4.406976744186046
2873359,4,B000RPD0IM,"I purchased this 5 DVD set in hopes of getting lots and lots of game footage.  Unfortunately, there was far more in the way of interviews than I wanted.  It's great for what it is, but I really wanted more game footage.  The length of the program on each DVD was also shorter than I hoped, considering each DVD covers an entire season.  That's why I was left wanting more game footage.  It's hard to show much in an hour for an entire season per DVD.  They could have put the entire thing on 2 DVDs.",1209600000,7,499,4.145833333333333
2873360,5,B000RPD0IM,"I got it for my husband for Christmas, he is a hard core fan and he watched all of them on the same day! That is how much he loved it!!! I saw four of them and the quality is amazing! The interviews are great and it really gets you... I knew some things but I did learned a lot about the Cowboys with them. You won't regret this purchase!",1199404800,4,338,3.842857142857143
2873361,5,B000RPD0IM,"Great Entertainment.  My husband is a Cowboy fan since the 60's.  I can't buy enought ""Dallas Cowboy"" videos or books.",1196208000,,118,4.85
2873362,5,B000RPD0IM,"If you are a fan of ""The Boys"" then this is a must have set, it covers all 5 of their Superbowl victories (1971, 1977, 1992, 1993 and 1995) with highlites and interviews with many of the main players in each game, this 5 dvd set is excellent in it's depth and quality, i give it 5 stars!",1191974400,12,287,3.9655172413793105
2873363,5,B000RPD0IM,"absolutely awesome......  insights and interview bits make this a treat..... moments like Jimmy Johnson discussing a newsreel on the Bills practice for superbowl 28 showing him a play the Bills didn't use all year , but was attempted 3 times in SB28 , and how that affected the game......  little things like that make this series a repeat viewing pleasure",1412380800,,356,4.916666666666667
2873364,5,B000RPD0IM,"Bought this as a Christmas present to myself to relive the Glory Days of Americas Team: the Dallas Cowboys. Watched all 5 DVS and was amazed at what NFL Films did to document all of this footage and put it together for a DVD to celebrate a championship season. Each disc comes with its own NEAT, slim DVD case with the Champioship Ring image on the case and printed on the disc. The spines of the cases are also labeled and they come with a big box in which all of the DVDs fit! MUST HAVE FOR ANY COWBOYS FAN TO REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN THE COWBOYS WERE SO DOMINANT IN THE 70's AND EARLY 90's!",1369526400,,600,4.093220338983051
2873365,5,B000RPD0IM,"It's great to have the Landry years and player perspective from those two seasons, as well as the Jimmy Johnson era and how he built a dynasty in the '90s. It's equally interesting to see why Jimmy Johnson called it quits, thus entering the Barry Switzer years. I never realized the pressure put on Barry Switzer to coach the Cowboys to a ""three-peat."" The player perspective on the Jimmy Johnson / Jerry Jones bouts, along with the contrasting personality of Barry Switzer is quite interesting. This is a great package with an attractive price. Get it. You'll be glad you did.",1369440000,2,577,4.7227722772277225
2873366,5,B000RPD0IM,"You can buy each super bowl individually or in this set. This is a fans dreams come true. Each season has plenty to offer in highlights & interviews. As a fan you always want more, butt these were laid out in the same style. The only complaint is that you wish it had more, butt that's how these were all made. If this can't make a fan smile, there maybe nothing that could!",1362873600,,374,4.136986301369863
2873367,5,B000RPD0IM,"This is a great buy for any cowboys fan! If you love the cowboys like i do then you're gonna love this DVD. It goes all the way back to the 1971 SuperBowl, and goes through all the SuperBowls of the Cowboys!",1325548800,,207,3.9523809523809526
2873368,5,B000RPD0IM,"All of these ""America's Game"" series are absolutely spectacular.  I've purchased several sets (Giants, 49ers, Broncos, etc) and every single one has been simply outstanding.  NFL Network does a great job with all their stuff, but this series definitely tops the cake!",1325289600,,267,5.333333333333333
2873369,5,B000RPD0IM,"This is a great colection of all 5 Cowboy's Superbowl seasons. They are narrarated by 3 different key players from each of the championship runs. It was  very interesting to hear the background stories from the players and the highlights of each season are fantastic. It is great to relve all the action and story lines from the Cowboy's 5 Superbowl Championships. Like my Spur's Championship DVD's, I will continue to go back and enjoy them, especially during the summer when I am missing the Cowboys and am anticipating the season to come. How Bout Them Cowboys!",1268784000,2,564,4.814432989690721
2873370,5,B000RPD0IM,This is a must own for all Cowboy fans. If your a real die hard fan this is a must own piece of Cowboy greatness. [...],1254182400,,119,3.6153846153846154
2873371,5,B000RPD0IM,"Of course these videos are great, they have to do with the greatest team in the history of the NFL! On a more serisous note all the ""America's Game"" video/show no matter what team are extremely well made. We have watched quite a few on the NFL network and thought they were great so decided to buy the series for our favorite team.",1245542400,,331,4.26984126984127

8202054,3,B000RPD0IM,"This is a pretty good box set.  5 dvds one for each Super Bowl the Cowboys have won.  The 1971 season is told by Duane Thomas who could have been a Hall Of Fame running back.  But he was only in his second season and was one of the biggest headaches the Cowboys ever had.  Bob Lilly who said if the other team scored it was going to be over a bunch of dead bodies.  Compare the last 10 games that the defense played that year with the last 10 games that the '85 Bears defense played.  The Cowboys went toe to toe with them.  And are still the only team to not give up a touchdown in the Super Bowl.  And Roger Staubach talks about the offense.
The 1977 disc has Tony Dorsett, Charlie Waters, Drew Pearson and Thomas Henderson talking about the season.  The second the Cowboys drafted
Dorsett they became the favorites for the Super Bowl that year.  And dominated the Super Bowl against Denver that year.  With their defense only giving up 40 yards passing and creating eight turnovers.
Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Ken Norton Jr.  are featured in the 1992 disc.  Aikman stayed healthy for the whole year for the first time.  And the Cowboys had a star studded offense with their offensive line and Aikman, Emmitt smith, Michael Irvin and Jay Novacek.  They also had the NFLs number one defense.  And not one Pro Bowl player on defense.  Which they rallied behind.  Which created nine turnovers in the Super Bowl against Buffalo.  Aikman won the MVP but it could just as easily been Norton.
The 1993 disc has Emmitt Smith, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Bates talking about the season.  The '93 team I think is the best team the Cowboys have ever had.  Being defending Champions and easily winning another Super Bowl.  That team had 8 Pro Bowl players on offense.  And 4 on defense.  Emmitt Smith won MVP and again it could just as easily gone to James Washington who I would have voted for.  Bill Bates describes how he was so keyed up for the game he was hyperventilating.  After being hurt the year before and missing the Super Bowl.  He was on the field at the coin toss and yelled  ""We Want The Bowl"" when the Cowboys won the toss.  And you can tell the pride Jimmy Johnson has for that team.  Although he has to have mixed emotions and bitter sweet memories about that year.  And every body feels like the best was still yet to come.  And a sense of what might have been.
The 1995 disc is narrated by Larry Brown, Darren Woodson and Daryl Johnston and Rich Dalrymple who was in the front office.  Brown who won the MVP in this game with two key interceptions.  Then signed a huge free agent contract and left.  He along with Woodson and Johnston were there for all three Super Bowls.  Talk about how this team wasn't as good.
This is a must have for Cowboy fans.",1486166400,,2761,4.366141732283465
