5615940,4,B00BG4RJG2,"I met Lash in the mid 1960's when he was at the Calgary Stampede.  I got to see him in live action with his different sized bull whips and the tricks he had mastered.  His western films were fun to watch.  They were not to heavy in plot but taught excellent morals to the young people.  The producers were not of the calibre as those at Republic or Monogram studios.  These movies were well put together and Lash (Al) LaRue was a good actor.  He was a spitting image of Bogey.  A good series to have in a collectin of ""B"" westerns.",1371772800,23,531,4.147058823529412

amazon lists a release date of May 2013 for availability of this DVD set, but I bought it yesterday at Kmart for only $7.50.

It's a great collection of 12 Lash Larue westerns of varying quality and entertainment value. Any fan of old black and white grade B westerns will probably enjoy a couple of these movies, especially the ones in which Lash resorts to using his bullwhip rather than his gun to fight the bad guys.

Lash Larue wasn't the best western film actor, or the best looking western hero. Some have commented he bears a resemblance to Humphrey Bogart. Maybe, but I think Lash wins out in the looks department if you're comparing the two! And many of his films are quite entertaining. His gimmick with the bullwhip in some of the films is what set him apart from other B western heroes.

As B westerns, some of the films on this DVD set are poverty row productions, with cheap interior sets and obvious in-studio backdrops for closeups of outdoor chase scenes. A big problem I've noticed in several films is the loud, racy and annoying musical accompaniment, which sometimes doesn't even fit the action onscreen, or lack of it, and becomes a distraction.

Echo Bridge/Platinum Disc usually finds the best available film sources for their DVDs (take a look at the fantastic quality, restored Hopalong Cassidy films on DVD from this same company).  A couple years ago I bought what turned out to be a ""bootleg"" DVD set of Lash Larue films, and the quality was a lot worse than on this official release. But don't expect pristine video quality on most of the films here either, it varies from film to film from some footage that is pretty ragged, to excellent. Overall it's generally pretty good.  I sat and watched the first 4 of the films in a row last night, each clocking in at about an hour's running time. And 12 films for $7.50 (or even $14.99 if you're paying full list price) is one of the best DVD bargains in a long time.",1365811200,41,2164,4.561855670103093

5615988,3,B00BG4RJG2,"On the strength of Lash LaRue himself, this is the set to have of his, produced by Ron Ormond with much the same players as were also in the Monograms filmed in the same time frame in the 40's and 50's. Be aware that several of these films are remakes and or re-spliced to make more entries and while they lack continuity to some degree, they are watchable but confusing at times too. The musical score, itself is a gem, which sets it's self above most of the music in the genre. LaRue is great, Al St. John as ""Fuzzy"" also. Some of the notables in the cast include stunt men Bob Woodward, Sandy Sanders and actors Marshal Reed, Bob Cason and several other familiar faces. ""The Dalton's Women"" included here is a disaster and was made even worse by having a reel in the wrong order. Lash and Fuzzy can't save this one. A bomb, but a keepsake anyway.

5616018,3,B00BG4RJG2,"This is a good collection of movies in black and white, of course.  The video is probably as good as it can be considering the age of the original films.
All the films were shot  in the same location and to make it seem like different places, they used different camera angles.  If you remember the A and B double feature, or the Saturday matinee shows at the local theater, these B movies will bring back memories.  The dialog was written to fill in between the action.  And there was plenty of action: Pursuits on horseback, gunfights, fistfights and the bad guys get their comeuppance.  When you were nine years old this was exciting. So exciting in fact, kids would yell at the screen.  And oh, those oohs and ahs.
If your too young to remember, this collection will give you a glimpse of what your parents or grandparents had for entertainment at the movies and re-shown on early tv way back when (or in the newest vernacular ""back in the day"")",1454803200,6,949,4.482558139534884

5616023,3,B00BG4RJG2,"First, the picture quality is generally excellent; close to the quality of the Gene Autry sets.  The picture in THE BLACK LASH is so clear that you can even see the automobiles parked on the other side of the rodeo arena in the opening sequence......a sequence which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  Funny.  Secondly, the sound quality is usually good but a few of the movies had sound that was a bit muffled.  Generally, the soundtrack music was loud and overbearing.  Not a plus for me.

The plots, as many have written, were a mishmash of long scenes from the early films spliced into the later films.  OUTLAW COUNTRY was way too long at 72 minutes, with endless chase scenes that go on forever.  However, they solved that by cutting 17 minutes and reissuing it as FRONTIER PHANTOM with a few new scenes added to make us think it was a new movie.  Likewise, THE BLACK LASH is a reworking of FRONTIER REVENGE.  And so it goes.  My favorite of the dozen movies here was FRONTIER REVENGE which co-starred the lovely Peggy Stewart and Jim ""Red Ryder"" Bannon.

Really, the best movie of the lot was THE DALTON'S WOMEN except for the mixup in switching two reels between the 20- and 41-minute marks.  You can get around that by fast forwarding through the wrong reel to where the correct reel starts, watch it, and then reverse the film to the point where the movie went off course.  THE DALTON'S WOMEN runs 77 minutes and features Jack Holt, Tom Tyler, Ray Hatton, and Terry Frost.  There is also some better music in the saloon.  Probably unique to B-westerns is the barroom brawl between two women.  It is truly rough and tumble female wrestling match, and goes on for quite a while.  You never saw so much cleavage in any other B-western!

In summation, this set does not cost much but what do you expect?  Just get it and enjoy it for what it is.",1453161600,,1862,4.452662721893491

While it was common practice to reuse footage over and over again I don't think so much footage was ever used to make films this close to each other. Frontier Phantom for example is made up of footage from Outlaw Country three years earlier. Thundering Trail has footage from earlier films as does The Black Lash  and The Vanishing Outpost. It seems like a good 35 to 40 minutes of each 55 minute film is footage being reused.

Known as 'The Lash' he has three tracts that puts him apart from most others - he can use two six-guns, puts a bullwhip to good use, and when in a fight and ready to land the soccer punch, he jumps into the air just before the knockout blow.

Back in Lash's day all the movies were made in the same district as the scenery stays the same throughout all the movies, but who cares, the movies are great to watch and are typical westerns.

I enjoyed all the movies in the set and recommend them to western buffs and give it five stars, even though there is some copying going on.",1384041600,5,769,4.1824324324324325

5616119,3,B00BG4RJG2,"The Lash La Rue western series started at PRC, one of the more prolific B-movie distributors. It was discontinued when PRC went upscale as Eagle-Lion in 1948. Producer Ron Ormond continued the series at his bottom-of-the-barrel Western Adventures Productions until it died a pitiful death in 1952. This collection from Echo Bridge contains 12 of Lash's Western Adventures pictures from 1948 through 1952. They all follow the standard PRC western format with Lash as the tough hero and Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John as his comic sidekick. As the market for true B-westerns dried up in the late forties, the budgets for the La Rue westerns shrunk to the point that producer Ormond was shooting entries in less than a week and recycling action sequences from prior pictures. The results are fascinatingly bad movies with garbled story lines, mismatched scenes and characters apparently travelling back and forth in time. However, the bottom line is that Lash is always fun to watch (even when he can't get his lines out) and Fuzzy can be good when he is not forced to ad-lib his comedy routines. Echo Bridge assembled some good prints for this collection, but could have taken a little more care in mastering it. in ""The Daltons' Women,"" for example; an entire reel is placed out of sequence. Still, this is a welcome collection of hard-to-find late B-westerns.",1379116800,12,1348,4.942731277533039

5616133,5,B00BG4RJG2,"Lash Larue is a true cult figure in the annals of low budget western movies. Dressed in black, he could wield a bullwhip with style, and his sidekick was the former vaudeville clown Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John.
St. John is nearing 60 in his last go round as a sidekick - he died in 1963 at the age of 70 - and he still loves to show off the acrobatics he honed on stage and in silent comedies.
These movies were shot in a week. They feature canned, often hopelessly cheerful background music and limited sets - Lash and the bad guys chase each other over the same quarter mile of terrain over and over again - but Lash's bullwhip tricks and Fuzzy's physicality make them stand out.",1377475200,4,673,4.265625

Keen to see films with guy who used a whip!
Not disappointed. Stories as with all westerns fairly obvious.

5616139,5,B00BG4RJG2,"In a 1975 episode of THE ROCKFORD FILES. ""A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE,"" Rockford asks his friend Angel,""Are you trying to channel Lash Larue?"" I wonder how many people recognized the  reference.
  Alfred ""lash"" Larue was an enigma. He would not tell his age or where he was born. He looked a little like Bogart and talked out the side of his mouth like a B movie gangster, yet he became a B western cowboy star from 1947-52. He played the hero but dressed all in black, rode a black horse and carried a black whip which he used to subdue outlaws. He had trouble with the law and alcohol, but worked some with an evangelist who called himself John 3:16. Wouldn't you like to see his identification cards?
  Lash starred in 20 B westerns, the first 8 for PRC. PRC was a small studio known for its cheap production values. the remaining 12 were produced by Ron Ormond. Ormond's productions made PRC look like MGM. The collector's set here contains the 12 Ormond films. The first 6 were directed by Ray Taylor who directed the PRC films. He was an old hand at westerns, and OUTLAW COUNTRY is above average with a 70 minute running time, good cast, and decent production values. A small problem is a rough soundtrack for some of the films.
  The second 6 were all directed by Ormond. Actually cut and paste would be more accurate. He shot a few minutes of new footage supplemented by many minutes of footage from the first 6. that is  very confusing, if you see the first 6. KING OF THE BULLWHIP is probably the best, with Lash and the villain fighting with whips. One of the best things about all 20 of the films starring Lash is Al St. John as the sidekick, Fuzzy Q. Jones. He was a fine comic actor who started in silent films.
  The 12 films in the set were some of the last B westerns  produced. They are still entertaining to us who remember seeing them in the forties and fifties. And the price is reasonable.
  I first saw Lash in the early seventies when he came to Melbourne, FL As an evangelist. I went to a service. He stood, still dressed in black, quoting poetry, some scripture, and his philosophy of life. The person in charge said Lash would be at a local topless bar the next night to ask about the closing of that establishment. I had to see that. Lash came, looked at the audience and the dancers, talked to the manager for a bit and left. The bar stayed open. I was disappointed:Lash did not bring his whip. In my imagination, I Could see lash driving all of us sinners and miscreants out of the place snapping that whip behind us.
  Lash's name is still heard in popular culture. I don't know why, but i do not think a character in a TV show or movie will ever say to another ""Are you trying to channel Roy Rogers?""
