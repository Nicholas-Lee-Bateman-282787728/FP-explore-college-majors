2593253,4,B000FZEQWI,"Tetsuo: The Iron Man is not a Japanese horror movie, but a dark art film which was way ahead of it's time. Those watching it expecting a simple J-Horror flick are bound for disappointment. Those watching it for artistic merit and visionary visual experimentation will be in for a ride.

Portraying many different ideas and metaphors, it's all wrapped in a sort of stop-motion cyber-punk style of filming with a loose plot of (at it's basic element) a man whom sticks an iron rod into his leg and slowly transforms a horrid machine. However underlaying symbols and quick-cam shots riddle the film into puzzles of fear and technological nightmares. Metaphors of trials in Japanese culture (technological take-over, alienation, xenophobia, guilt, and modern isolation) plague the screen which gives a strong depth to it, making it worthy of multiple watches.

Though let me warn you, it is not pretty. The reason it's frequently upheld in the horror genre is that it IS also bloody and bone-driven with fx and violence. Many of the scenes can be downright really creepy and suspenseful. Body parts are turned into machinery, people are stabbed and beaten, and there's a Hell of alot of screaming.

Don't just take this film at face value. Like I said, when broken down it is more of an art film than horror flick. There are alot of layers to it and you need to look deep to interpret the substance of the subplots and symbolism. Not only that but the style of filming and camera work. Yes, did I mention it's absolutely insane in it's musical score, camera angles and cinematography?

Anyway if this entices you at all then definitely check this film out because it's right up there with Eraserhead, The Holy Mountain, and many other great dark surrealist-type films.",1253577600,,1764,4.850498338870432
2593254,4,B000FZEQWI,"Tetsuo is about a man that discovers bits of metal protruding from his body. They slowly start to take over his body as he transforms into a machine.

Tetsuo may be one of the most bizarre cinematic experiences of my life. It is very reminiscent of a Nine Inch Nails video, with a lot of stop motion photography, seemingly random images, and very little dialogue. It comes in at just over an hour long, but can still be difficult to follow at times. I imagine that most of the film is symbolic, at least to the Director, but often seems like an amalgam of violence and sex filmed in black and white on a shaky camera.

The entire film is rather grainy and shot in black and white. The shots used are anything but conventional, as heads are often out of center, out of focus and difficult to discern. You could look at it as poorly done or genius I guess. It is without a doubt different than anything I have ever seen before.",1201219200,4,925,4.310344827586207
2593255,3,B000FZEQWI,"Japanese employee Tetsuo is just having a normal day until he runs into a bizarre man with strange objects shoved into his body and gets into an accident. After that, strange things start to happen to Tetsuo as metal pieces start appearing on some parts of his body and becomes a bizarre semi-cyborg as the person that started the accident begins to taunt him through his horrifying transformation to the path of destruction.

Weird and mind-bending Sci-fi horror film from Japan contains surreal and disturbing imagery blended with bizarre special effects and stop motion animation. The plot is a little farfetched but this is a very gory and hyperactive movie that feels like a nightmare come true for the viewer in the tradition of David Cronenberg, H.P. Lovecraft and David Lynch. It's not for all tastes but still a fine shocking Japanese film for fans of Sci-fi, horror and gore.

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with Japanese language and English subtitles and only one extra which is a first look at the director's newest movie called ""Vital"".

8127724,1,B000FZEQWI,"Ok.  I'm all about OUT THERE kinda movies. I also fully understand the artistry, cinematography, and the use of certain camera tricks and leaving certain things up to the imagination when it comes to these kinds of movies.  I love horror.  I love Indies.  I love sci-fi. This movie....SUCKED.  For all it says it is in the description, and other reviews I read about it, I decided to give it a try.  Wish I hadn't.  I even stuck with it all the way to the end, just in case at some point it made sense or explained whether he was jyst insane and imagining half the crap in the movie, or if he was able to accomplish what I thought he set out to do.  It was dismal, didn't make sense half the time, and gave me a headache. Not the artistry it claimed to be.  Skip this one...you'll THANK yourself for it!!",1499040000,,804,4.2026143790849675

8127726,4,B000FZEQWI,Very odd movie.. keeps your interest if you can make it past the opening scene.,1408060800,,79,4.333333333333333
8127727,3,B000FZEQWI,I got this as supposedly Aronofsky got inspiration got inspiration for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM from it.  I want to get to this but haven't so far.,1402185600,,142,4.2592592592592595
8127728,5,B000FZEQWI,While this movie was one of the biggest mind trip but it was more coherent than Eraserhead. This movie is one of the greatest visual experience and has a lot of metaphors. Its a movie that has to be checked out for a visual experience.,1397520000,,235,4.2444444444444445
8127729,5,B000FZEQWI,"One of the most bizarre films I have seen...watched it several times now, and it is still somewhat disturbing....and funny...and insane. Have shown it to some friends, most of whom look at me in disbelief and wonder, shake their heads, and ask me not to bring it by again, LOL.",1386633600,3,277,4.56
8127730,4,B000FZEQWI,"It is often difficult to describe the technological powerhouse that is TETSUO: THE IRON MAN. Japanese filmmaker Shinya Tsukamoto gives the viewer very little direction when it comes to the narrative, focusing less on the dialog and characters than on the insane visuals. Although it isn't easily discernible, the plot involves a business man that drifts in and out of an industrial nightmare, where his body begins absorbing the metal object around him while turning him into a mechanical monstrosity. These horrifying visions are inter-cut with blurred memories of a terrible hit and run accident where he was left the victim, but which of these two worlds represents reality, and which is just a dream? TETSUO is filmed with a fevered pace and hyper-kinetic energy that explodes on-screen, engulfing the audience in a sea of wires and steel. The mangled bodies of metal and flesh immediately draw to mind the works of David Cronenberg (particularly VIDEODROME), while the rough black and white filming and crude but effective animation can't help but recall David Lynch's ERASERHEAD. Despite these similarities, Tsukamoto proves to be an inventor in his field, and he has created a style and energy that has gone unmatched through the TETSUO series.

8127731,5,B000FZEQWI,"The first time I watched TETSUO: THE IRON MAN, I sat wide-eyed, unable to speak! I did make sounds, mostly laughter and choking noises! Atmosphere? Well, it's a fever dream at light speed w/ hints of Lynch, Cronenberg, and a few thousand kitchen sinks tossed in! Techno-industrial freakazoidal mayhem! This is a movie to be watched many times. Each time allows the viewer to absorb a bit more of the insane scenery and ridiculously fantastic plot! Turning into metal, only to do battle w/ and eventually join forces w/ the nemesis. Together, they become one super-entity and go forth to destroy the world! Holeee s#!t!...",1279324800,2,621,4.923809523809524
8127732,5,B000FZEQWI,What can you say about this movie. I've heard this movie likened to David Lynch and Cronenberg and they weren't far off. It's an amazing movie full of gore and stop motion cinema. Highly suggested.,1255478400,,197,4.6571428571428575
8127733,4,B000FZEQWI,"While Tetsuo is a really bizarre, low budget, surrealist underground Japanese cyberpunk movie, it has a number of interesting themes running through it. On a societal level, Tetsuo explores how man's technological dash to the future has resulted in an acute fear of technology, and that its ever encroaching progress is destroying our humanity.  This is symbolically represented by a runner surrounded by scrap metal, and then later, a man in running gear who's slowly being taken over by machinery when competing with another machine man.

The clear message at the end is that by constantly competing with one another in our strive for perfection in an orderly society, we are destroying humanity at its core. Technology is our tool of choice for this destructive competition.

On a personal level, Tetsuo explores how guilt and repression can turn people into virtual ""monsters."" In this, we see an instance where an accidental car crash makes someone completely lose all sense of humanity and boundaries. This seems to fit with Asian cultures in that they are usually very reserved, but when they ""cross"" that line, the level of anger and craziness almost doesn't have a limit.

In combining this with the societal thought, Tetsuo posits that we are using technology as a crutch to cover up our own frailties, but that in doing so, we only serve to subvert our humanity. When this subversion is released, it becomes a perversion of immense proportions. In this sense, Tetsuo truly stretches the cyberpunk notion of ""no boundaries"" to its fullest.

Tetsuo is a great example of what a low-budget sci-fi film can accomplish. I thought the cinematography was absolutely brilliant. We get cool stop-motion animation, incredibly interesting shadows and film angles, and wonderful use of different shot textures. The industrial sound track furthers the bizarre mood. Truly, I can't say enough of how impressed I am by this film. Again, Tetsuo is DEFINITELY not for everyone, but it certainly belongs in the top 10 best cyberpunk films ever made!",1254182400,4,2042,5.083582089552239
