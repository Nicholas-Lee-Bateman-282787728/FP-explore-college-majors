The video that arrived when I ordered from this page is a Big Comfy Couch video--not the same video at all, and not what the other review describes.  Amazon only seems to sell the Sesame Street _1-2-3 Count with Me_ bundled with _Do the Alphabet_.",1041033600,,343,4.60655737704918
7909075,4,B00000G3LO,"My 18 month old has been watching this video for months. We both really like it.  Ernie visits the Furry Arms Hotel and teaches the managers how to count (to 15).  It is packed with new catchy songs as well as old  favorites. My favorites songs are: 1-2-3 Count With Me (sung by Ernie &  Company), 1 and 2 and 3 (sung by  counting crows), Seven (sung by Dorothy  & Gold Fish friends) and Five (rapped by M.C. Elmo)",952732800,3,414,4.177215189873418
