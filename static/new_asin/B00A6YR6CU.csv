8547304,1,B00A6YR6CU,"There are no interviews with anyone of consequence. I got it for my friend as a joke, and this biography is just that: a joke.",1392595200,,126,4.08
8547305,1,B00A6YR6CU,A dvd bout the trivial details of the world's most overrated singer. Sounds about as fun as walking into a port-a-potty that has just being used by a sweaty construction worker who had the runs.,1390780800,,194,4.571428571428571
8547306,1,B00A6YR6CU,"Very lazy movie about the star's life seems like nothing more than a quick cash-in by mentioning the baby in the title.  The movie consists of interviews of celebrity magazine writers and bloggers.  The only family member they managed to interview was an ""aunt"".  There was nothing exclusive or interesting ever mentioned.  NOTE: Beyonc is NOT in this movie.  They show clips of her but she is never once interviewed.  This movie is just gossip columnists talking about her mixed in with paparazzi clips of her getting off planes.",1379980800,,530,4.898876404494382
8547307,3,B00A6YR6CU,"I love stories about strong women and Beyonce is right on the top of that list. However, I wanted to discover a little more about Beyonce and everything in this movie I've seen before; so I didn't have any surprises.  I'll wait for the HBO story to come out on DVD.",1373846400,,265,4.196078431372549
8547308,1,B00A6YR6CU,"She's the epitomy of  self obssessed narcissistic and shallow. All she is is a pretty face and a nice booty who can carry a tune. Nothing more... There is all this inexplicable hype surrounding this chick. I cannot imagine that she isn't superficial and self obsessed and do you think she would've even have looked in Jay-z's direction if he was just an average joe? Folks, stop being so foolish, following her every mundane move like if she was superhuman. Cmon please, ""Baby and Beyond""??",1369872000,2,490,4.764705882352941
8547309,2,B00A6YR6CU,"This DVD was nothing more than her associates, family members, etc giving their unsolicited opinion about her life. Nothing at all regarding information directly from her. It was misleading and incorrectly titled in my opinion. I am just not a ""constantly returning merchandise"" person so I kept it.",1362873600,11,299,5.25
