2635925,2,B000HEVZSK,well this movie was ok but they showed alot of the same clips over and over. But the telling of the history is pretty good.,1189814400,,123,3.96
2635926,1,B000HEVZSK,I couldn't stand the excitement of waiting for this movie to come in the mail. Amazon did an awesome job of getting it to me very quickly! As soon as I received the DVD and popped it in. This movie was a total disappointment. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I'd like to call it a complete mess. I don't know what the producer/director was going for when creating this mess but they did an outstanding job marketing the movie.,1186963200,4,434,4.304878048780488
2635927,1,B000HEVZSK,"This was, simply put, the worst documentary I've ever seen, and that it currently rates four stars on Amazon tells you more about the tastes of its reviewers than it does about the DVD itself. Forty-five minutes into the film, my wife got up and walked out of the room, saying ""I can't take one more of these quick cuts or weird sound effects. When is this supposed to get scary rather than annoying?"" If you want a documentary to scare you because it is authentically scary, then do yourself a favor and skip this one. Please. I should have taken the Netflix reviewers more seriously.

Ostensibly, this documentary is about the ghosts of Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a hulking building from the 1920s that was first used as a TB hospital and then as a badly run geriatric home until it was closed in 1980. According to the filmmakers, around 63,000 people died in the building during its tenure as a sanatorium, and so there are ample opportunities for hauntings. Except for one problem---a quick search of the Internet reveals that there is no such death statistic; all I can find is the same sourceless figure repeated ad nauseum. Maybe a few hundred people died of TB in the place, at most, but 63,000 is simply unsupportable, particularly for a place with a capacity of around 400. (That number more likely refers to the total number of deaths in Kentucky!) Alas this sense of inflation characterizes much of the rest of the material in the film.

Three of the main sources of information are the new owner, his wife, and his father, all of whom obviously have an agenda trying to trump up business for tours through the big, old, spooky building. The much-hyped ""death tunnel"" was just an access corridor that allowed for the sheltered (from the elements and from onlookers) transport of materiel and deceased patients. ""Actual ghost photos"" just reveal pixelated blurs and blobs of light (""orbs"") and the ""electronic voice phenomena"" are laughable bursts of noise and static with suggestive subtitles over screenshots of oscilloscopes. We are told in one of many PowerPoint slideshows which pass for section intros that the orbs seen in some photos ""contain the spirits of multiple people""---where did they get this ""fact"" from? (That the same PPT slides are filled with typos was, sadly, unsurprising.) As for research into the stories behind the stories, we are told definitively that the ghost of room 502 hung herself in 1926. Or was it 1932? Or did she throw herself from the roof? (So much for that research, eh?) And one would have thought that, with all the friggin' video cameras being toted around, at least one person would have captured some pretty unambiguous weirdness on film, if the place was as filled with ghosts as the narrators would have us believe. Alas, this was simply not the case. The directors, aka the Booth Brothers (two British douchebags in cowboy hats and bad facial hair), tried to make this dearth of raw material scarier through the overuse of quick cuts, unsettling camera angles, spooky sound effects, annoying screams, and footage from *Death Tunnel,* their unnecessary horror flick about a sorority initiation inside Waverly. For an audience weaned on *Saw III,* these manipulations probably establish *Spooked* as a masterpiece; for those of us over 25, it just makes it an annoying waste of time. Truly, the only scary thing about this DVD is that most folks have rated it over 1 star.",1183334400,29,3430,4.841567291311755
2635928,5,B000HEVZSK,"I really enjoyed watching this dvd because it focused more on the the true facts of Waverly Hills. Some of the previous patients and employees were interviewed and actual pictures that I have never seen on any of the Waverly Hills website were also included.  Although there was some  poorly taken ghost photography and EVPs that were barely audible included which by all means proved no haunting.  I am not saying that Waverly Hills in not haunted but if you really want to believe it is see the episode of Ghost Hunters that made me more of a believer.

It is to bad that no one can make a dvd about Waverly Hills which has so much history and just leave the ghost stories out.",1181088000,10,679,4.408
2635929,3,B000HEVZSK,"I didn't HATE this movie/documentary. It was just not well thought out when filming. Editing and interviews were hodge-podge and not very interesting. No real narrator to guide you along. Didn't really ""go"" anywhere. It was just ""here's some information, here's some more, here's some more.""  It didn't suck - but it wasn't jaw dropping either. More sad, depressing, unfortunate... I wish there were more stories about hauntings and happenings, than what went on there when it was an in-use facility.

Does have some cool photos, but right when you think it's about to get interesting, it'd cut to some former patient saying ""No - I never saw that. Never knew that."" Total buzz kill..",1179360000,4,684,4.939130434782609
2635930,2,B000HEVZSK,"This has to be the most dissapointing DVD purchase of my life. I thought I was getting something genuinely scare that offered real compelling evidence of supernatural activity but instead it was the same old fuzzy orbs, evp that sounds like nothing till a suggestion is put into your head and the odd shadowy figure that again looks like nothung until cropped sharpened and a caption is inserted to suggest what it is. Unbelievable clap trap. I have no doubt that the sanitorium itself is an opressive and scary place to visit but this DVD conveys nothing of that and comes across as less scary than a bad episode of Most Haunted.

I have heard about the Waverly Hills Sanatorium by watching it in MTV's Fear, Scariest places on earth and on Ghost Hunters.  Let me tell you, this is way better than any of the other shows/documentatries I have seen.

2636014,4,B000HEVZSK,"Well, I have to say this is not one of the scariest ""ghost docs"" I have ever seen. It is fascinating to see the place that so many lived in for years while they had the disease TB. I don't go along with the point made that there were 60,000 that had died there, though. A few thousand is more believable to me over the time period that the disease had no cure. I think the program is good, but not spectacular. If you are looking for stuff to jump out at you at every turn, forget it, this is not the program for it. Waverly Hills is a BIG place and I do think there are residual hauntings as well as some that have haunted the place after dying there. The body chute or ""death chute"" as it is known more commonly would probably freak me out if I was there in the dark. It plays on your senses for one thing and knowing many people went down that way to the outside just adds to the feeling of it all.
Is it Haunted? Probably. A place that HUGE with thousands dying could have possible spirit activity.
I do believe in the afterlife, so I do believe there are spirits, good and bad.
I think the makers of this documentary did a fairly decent job for what they tried to accomplish. I liked looking at the place and it had some good pictures of the people that lived and worked there.
Information and facts were probably not accurate and that is unfortunate, because if you are making this type of film at a hospital that has notoriety to it, get the research done.
The menu is decent and gives you scene access.  The music is okay and not so loud we can't hear the people talking.
If you are interested in getting this, check around for a good price. I got mine for much less than this site is asking.",1436140800,,1700,4.13595166163142

2636016,5,B000HEVZSK,What more can I say about this DVD then awesome! I was turned on to the Booth Brothers after seeing this program on the syfy channel. Once I had seen they had it available for DVD I bought it as soon as possible. Love to just sit back and watch this either alone or with friends. Be warned that this movie even had given me the creeps. Im a huge horror buff and rarely get spooked but this program spooked me!. I love the research they did on waverly hills and the emotions portrayed really hit you hard! It even teared me up a few times knowing what the people stationed at that hospital had to go through to try to find a cure to the epidemic of TB at the time.

2636091,4,B000HEVZSK,"I had seen both Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters shows on Waverly and bought this out of curiosity and not just for the spooky aspect. My great aunt went with some friends on a lark to get free TB testing back in the 30s and didn't go home again for over 10 years. She was one of the lucky ones.

Contrary to what some say, horrible things did go on in these places. They convinced the patients and families that these experimental treatments would help them or even did them without permission and some of them had next to no worth even being thought of as 'medical treatments', Mengele would have loved them. My great aunt had some procedures done on her without permission of her or her husband as the doctors were able to get away with a lot more back then. I was feeling a little sick when I saw some of the interviews with former patients and staff and some of the pictures of the things done there. I felt so sorry for those former patients. I do think the concentration camp photos were uncalled for and unneeded. As for the ghost hunting...it could have been left out of this one, there was enough horror just in the real history of the place.",1335916800,,1154,4.342592592592593

It puts us into the scene because we now are able to experience it from the insight of those who were there, from those who lived there.

2636095,4,B000HEVZSK,"Frankly, I'm stunned by the reviews I've read here which criticize the filmmakers for, essentially, not doing their homework.  Some folks here have said that the knock on this flick is that there's little attention paid to the history of the facility, and that the film focuses too much on going for weakly-executed scares, instead.

I have to say (after seeing the treatment this location has gotten in other ghost-hunting television shows and movies) I was, on the contrary, quite impressed with just how tastefully the subject matter was handled.  The film actually goes into quite a bit of history, discussing both the building's use as a tuberculosis hospital and then, later, as a nursing home, before being shut down by the government entirely.  They speak with former patients, former employees, ghost hunters, the present-day staff, and even some cast and crew who produced a fictional movie which was set there.  Quite a bit about tuberculosis (as well as the rationales behind some of the seemingly-bizarre treatments for it at that time) is laid out and explained.  I'm not quite sure what else they could have done to convince some folks that they gave the history its due attention.

Sure, there are some (I guess some would say) hokey visual and audio effects, and (admittedly) as far as some of the ""ghostly"" pictures and recordings go, I often don't know what the heck I'm looking at, or am supposed to be hearing.  But, on the whole, I have to say that (creepy DVD case cover image aside) this film was not at all what I thought it would be.  I was, to be honest, expecting precisely what a lot of the negative reviewers here describe, but that's simply not what this was.  In fact, I even told a friend, don't watch it for the scares; the real history they discuss is much more horrifying, all by itself.

I don't know, perhaps I just watched a different movie than everyone else did, but I was pleasantly surprised.",1323302400,,1935,4.729166666666667

2636099,2,B000HEVZSK,"Some parts of this documentary on Waverly Hills were good, yes, and quite creepy. But when I see a credibility issue I cannot enjoy the rest of it. For one thing, a 15 year old is interviewed and listed as a ""historian."" I don't really care about some imagined experience of a teenager, and if they've read a few books it still doesn't make them a historian. A band named after a haunted room number is here, screeching and howling their ""music."" Again, their opinion doesn't mean much. What gave us fits though was when they were talking about the body chute, a tunnel where dead bodies were removed so patients didn't see them. A person was talking about all the bodies that passed through the chute, and footage was shown. NOT footage of the chute in it's day, but footage of concentration camp victims! This was film recognizable to any, um, actual historian, and was shot by US soldiers when they liberated the camps in Germany. That's where they lost us. Another chuckle comes from a guy with an EMF monitor who freaks as his monitor goes off. On the wall near him is a big electrical outlet or fuse box, not sure what it was. Stick to Ghost Hunters. They are more professional, no shock value or awful music, and they don't jump when they hear a noise. They try to rule out everything before labeling anything paranormal (not necessarily a haunting). They don't have silly psychics running around giving their unscientific ""feelings,"" nor do they yell like schoolgirls when a noise is heard.",1298246400,2,1498,4.635338345864661

Of course there was suffering had by the TB patients and some of them died and so did nursing home patients, but there's little evidence that the staff was all that horrific or abusive, which is what this doc consistently attempts to imply. Additionally, the actual photos of ghosts and the supposed EVP recordings of spirits were totally unconvincing.  Their interpretations of ghosts in the images are akin to laying back on the grass on a summer day and saying ""that cloud looks like a bunny rabbit"" and ""OMG this cloud looks like my dead uncle"".  As with most EVP recordings I've heard in my life, the voices are way too unintelligible and the people who recorded them just seem to be trying to fit what they want to hear with the tone and cadence of the recording, more than any objective, open-minded interpretation.

2636152,2,B000HEVZSK,"First of all, slap a cool looking ""spooky"" cover on the DVD, and you have any horror movie fans attention, even the ones who saw ""Death Tunnel"". That's how I came across this, I thought it was going to be a movie, but it's actually a documentary... however, don't believe for one second that any of the contents are based on anything that ever really happened.

This ""spook-u-mentry"" interviews supposed people who tell their little ghost stories about a hospital that really does exist in Kentucky, that was built to help patients in the early 1900's who had TB. It stayed a hospital until about 1960, and then became a retirement home until about 1980 before it was shut down. Now, these people being interviewed are claiming that the events that happened in a movie that was shot there called ""Death Tunnel"", was based on actual paranormal facts... *COUGH*BULL*COUGH*[..censored..]

In the movie, Death Tunnel, they try to claim that the abandoned hospital is now haunted, in particularly by a little girl with rubber balls, and shadows... so in this documentary they have people who claim they where security guards and what not, and claim they have seen the little girl and played a game of ball with her... oh and everyone on the Scooby Doo Mystery Tour, hosted by a fat guy who claims EMT readers actually work, claim they see Shadows... yeah, you probably will at night with a bit of talk of boogedy boogadas, especially with trees and moon light helping that generally have been known to cast moving shadows... whats that word to describe that situation? oh yeah... nature.

But wait, there is still more... not only is there a ghost of a little girl who likes to play fetch, and these shadows you are guaranteed to always see on the tour and play laser tag with, you can also take unconvincing photos of your experience, and claim that dust scratches, lens flair and good old imagination is your major breakthrough to capturing a ghost on film. Sure, most people will look at it and say, ""well, hmmmm, these twigs of this tree COULD look a little like a face... however that cloud up their kinda has a shape like Elvis roping a bull""... oh, and try not to laugh too hard, but they also dedicate a section to not just ghosts on film, or creepy noises, but ORBS!!!... of coarse, what spooky documentary isn't complete without one? Whats even cooler, if you ask the ghosts nicely, they will come back to your very own home and pose for pictures in your own living room!!!... how nice of them, tho, i suppose, they don't have much else to do these days?

Not one of the photos or images they show in this documentary taken from inside or around the hospital even looks like a ghost... it's just wild imagination, or use of photoshop... I swear, one of the attempts at an obvious photoshop job was a picture taken on the 5th floor of the hospital where a nurse was supposed to have hung herself (even tho there is no documentation of this ever happening) it looks like a ninja, or Daniel San and Mr Miagi doing their Thai Chi on the beach... the Lotus stance? something like that... kinda reminded me of a graphic from Mortal Kombat... and then, it had another picture for the head... well, at least ghosts have a sense of humor and are doing karate poses for the souvenir snapshots.

The fat guy with the working EMP's states that the worst thing that has ever happened there, to him, was he had bits of concrete fly at his head... yeah, I don't blame ghosts for throwing things at you for making money out of lying about your BS experiences to financially gain something on an abandoned building with no known stories told about it until 1994 when the new owner thought to himself, ""Why did I buy this place? What use is it to me now? I think I will just claim it's suddenly become haunted for the first time in 70-80 years after it was built!"". Apart from bad nursing and care when it became a retirement home, which is why it got shut down, no one has ever told any stories of any wrong doing in that place, and no one had ever claimed it being haunted or seen these mysterious shadows that you can play laser tag with until the movie was made, and a fat guy is now making a small profit out of a ghost-hunt tour of the building.

This entire thing is 100% pure bull doodoo, yeah i said doodoo cause Amazon tend to not allow my reviews to be published when I use realistic everyday vocabulary. Which is probably for the best, as most of my reviews would be much simpler if i was allowed to just write ""This movie was bleeping BLEEP house""... but such is life. So anyway... overall, as much as I can see through this scam that it is just one big ploy to try and either get people to see their movie ""Death Tunnel"" which flopped harder then if Bill was expecting Monica and in walked Hillary tongue wrestling with Rosie *shudder* (I claim copyright to that horror story btw) but at least they do kind of redeem themselves here... the acting is mostly pretty good, you can really tell that the thing wasn't so much written and rehearsed, as more like ideas where given to actors and told, ""Ok, throw some BLEEP at us, and lets see what sticks, 'cuz Papa lost all his money on that p.o.s (Death Tunnel) now we wanna make up our losses with this fake DVD Bonus feature, that we will be conveniently selling separability from the DVD, as to make sure someone see's the first ever fake documentary DVD bonus feature that is better then the actual DVD feature itself""

Pros.
- Great laughs (even if they are unintentional, especially the thing about midget ghosts popping out to greet people to Haunted Munchkin Land.
- Acting is decent... especially that fat guy who is convinced his EMP meter can detect ghosts, and can explode too! Must have bought some dodgey equipment off of ebay... if i was him, I'd demand a refund.
- The photographic evidence of faces seen in twigs and wall cracks, ohh and lights! Ya just can't convince a person of paranormal activity more then taking pics of lights, lens flair, rain drops, aerosol spray, sneezes, cigarette smoke and just good ole taking shots too close to a window... (go try this, it's fun)

Cons.
- Pure 100% B.S. In fact; it's so full of a B.S, it's like watching 100 pounds of B.S in a 50 pound bag being stuffed into a lunchbox!
- It's watchable from start to finish.
- Proves that with no money, and knowledge of photoshop, you too can redeem a terrible movie.
- This band apparently is haunted by the ghost that they stole the room numbers off... (I snickered, but it was too stupid to really burst out laughing at)
- They say no one else lives near by... oh yeah? Try telling that to the people who live near by and say NOTHING has ever happened there when they went for a visit to see some ghosts and came back with nothing but haunting memories that they gave this fat guy money to take them on a tour around the hospital and claim this nice old historical building is now in possession of Casper & friends.
- No Ghostbusters :( (that's what killed it for me right there)",1280534400,2,7030,4.465369649805448

However, scary it isn't.  I'm not at all disappointed in it but my heart sure goes out to all those poor souls who were institutionalized there during that horrible period.  I was quite surprised though at how, in its hayday, it seemed to be an all encompassing hospital including a movie theater.
I've seen Waverly on Ghost Hunters as well as Spooked and I just don't see the place as haunted.  Let's say none of the videos has proven anything but that it's an old place that creaks and groans.
What's the deal with the ghost girl with no eyes?  All these ghost hunters mention it, but no one has said anything about it other than that one comment that keeps cropping up.  That and the bouncing ball seem to be the only ""ghostly"" comments that come up.

But it seemed like the film makers (and I use that term loosely) just went to a scary, sad TB sanitorium and filmed themselves being scared. There was little historical research, and what was presented was repetitious and disappointing. This place would be a wonderful ""haunting opporutunity"" for someone that wanted to take the time to research the history and present it as a true documentary. Instead it comes off looking like a teenage home movie with little substance. Yes, the location is creepy, but the video is amaturist at best. Save your money.

2636159,5,B000HEVZSK,"Start reading about ghosts or watching documentaries about ghosts, and it won't take long for the subject of Waverly Hills to pop up.  Most Haunted, Ghost Hunters, Scariest Places on Earth - they've all been here because this place never disappoints (unlike the Waverly Hills-inspired horror movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Tunnel/dp/B000CQQI8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Tunnel</a>, which was filmed on location here).  And why doesn't it disappoint?  Probably because well over 60,000 people supposedly died there over the course of a relatively few years.  The immense five-story building was built as a hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis, a disease which was running rampant in that area of Kentucky during the 1920s and 1930s.  Doctors performed a number of experiments and developed several rather extreme treatments for this awful disease, but Waverly's primary purpose, one could argue, was to quarantine the sick and dying in one place, away from the healthy.  The ""death tunnel"" came to be used to transport the large numbers of corpses down the hill and out of the place where the eyes of other patients could not see them, but most people who entered those halls knew they would likely never leave there alive.

In terms of ghostly phenomena, Waverly Hills basically has it all: full-body apparitions, audible ghostly communication, shadow people, intense electromagnetic frequency spikes, dramatic temperature changes, EMP voice recordings, ghostly smells, moving objects, orbs, ectoplasm, spirit photography, etc.  We get a good sampling of all that evidence in this documentary, although some of it - especially the photographs - are open to interpretation (i.e., I personally don't see a single thing in some of the photos).  We also get to hear from a wide range of eyewitnesses.  Waverly haunted tour guide Keith Age ushers viewers through the five haunted floors, making special note of the most active areas; ghost hunters and thrill seekers talk about their personal experiences there; Death Tunnel director Christopher Saint Booth and a few of the hotties in his dreadful film talk about experiences they had in the building during filming; Waverly security guards tell their stories; a nurse who worked there in the building's later years as a geriatric home (which was finally closed in 1981 after years of patient abuse) is interviewed; a couple of elderly sanatorium workers actually return to the place to help explain what went on there; and even two tuberculosis survivors of Waverly Hills get plenty of screen time.

Unlike Death Tunnel, the horror movie filmed on location and based on the stories of Waverly Hills, this documentary is actually full of creepy goodness.  It's also educational, especially for those of us too young to have lived through anything even approaching an epidemic.  Tuberculosis was a terrible disease; with dozens of victims dying every day, you get a new understanding of the death tunnel.  It sounds rather morbid and uncaring to talk about all of these bodies being removed through this tunnel, but here you can begin to appreciate the fact that it was used out of respect for the living.  Either way, it's all kinds of spooky - but not as much as the stories of the children who seem to be the most active of the untold number of spirits still haunting the walls of this living monument to human misery.",1234051200,5,3439,5.284403669724771

I would love to have the opportunity to visit it. The dvd is well made and very interesting. Not really scary but definately creepy. I did find it kind of amusing when the producer went outside and was pointing out where little creatures, goblins or some such thing, were seen and try as I might I couldn't see a thing.

2636210,2,B000HEVZSK,"""Spooked"" really is a horrible documentary. I'm very interested in the paranormal, and the Waverly Hills sanitarium is a very creepy spot, and if you can get past the eye-rollingly awful presentation of the material, I suppose there are some interesting elements.

There are interviews with some elderly folks who worked at the hospital, as well as former patients, and what they have to say is somewhat interesting. There are some nice shots of the location. The owners of the place and some local historians seem genuine, but the ridiculous ""evidence"" presented really leaves a lot to be desired.

Authentic period photographs are juxtaposed with ""horror hospital"", dramatized segments. The music and sound effects used are jarring, with an automated computer voice annoyingly listing off the ""phenomena"". Most of the collected ""evidence"" is ridiculous. Blurred, pixelated photos of ""real ghosts"", where there ISN'T ANYTHING (they circle the ""ghosts"" for the viewer. There is NOTHING THERE). Creepy sounding EVP samples with helpful subtitles to point out what is apparently being said from the garbled, inaudible mess. ORB photos, right? Dust illuminated by the flash, moisture in the air, all of it is presented dead-seriously as paranormal orb activity. Ridiculous!

The worst part of it all is the mention of some local hard rock band. We are actually presented with the scenario of this band having one of the ""ghosts"" FOLLOW THEM TO THEIR REHEARSAL SPACE (as seen by a ""scary mist"" in a photo). The biggest slap in the face is a live concert shot, where cigarette smoke is visible in the shot and we are told it is a GHOST WHICH NOW HAUNTS THEM. Please, please get real. The ""evidence"" is ridiculous on all counts. I'm happy to report that their lousy music then becomes part of the film's already crap soundtrack here and there. Nice.

Most of the other ""witnesses"" are members of a film crew, including a few buxom, wide-eyed actresses and a pair of cowboy-hat-wearing brothers who stammer out the history of the place and their crazy experiences while filming the godawful ""Death Tunnel"". They show some of their photos on a digital camera to a group of teenagers, who shriek in horror for some reason(presumably at the orb photos?). The juxtaposition of these slurring brothers next to hat-and-tie wearing senior citizens is embarrassing. In the middle of it all is a REAL LIFE GHOST HUNTER, with all the ghost hunting fix'ns, who seems like he's trying to drum up business for his lousy guided tours of the place.

I don't even want to talk about the numerous spelling and punctuation errors present in the text segues. It makes me too unhappy.

There are some interesting interviews, local folklore, and good site shots here. That is all. There is NO evidence of the paranormal provided, and all of it is layered underneath a ludicrous, obnoxious and cheap veneer.

Avoid, avoid, avoid. I really wish someone would do a good documentary about this place. It is a very creepy building.",1219190400,3,2998,4.960159362549801

It definitely held my attention all the way through, and allowed me to see more of Waverly Hills then I ever had before. The short part about Woodhaven was interesting and the things the women, who supposedly was a nurse there, said were horribly sad. However a man who claims to have worked at Woodhavn, says the rumors of such paitent abuse were untrue. This is something I hope will be more researched in the future. I must say I was disappointed in the ghost part of the movie. I agree with who ever said this was more of a historical documentary. The Evps were pretty good but the pictures weren't that impressive. I was completely unimpressed with all the orb pictures. Most of them were obivously due to the moisture and dust in and around the building. After all many shots showed water standing in the hallways. The wet foot print's were weird but would be easy to fake. For this being called the scariest place ever I expected better footage.

I feel like a lot of the information about WHS out there is sketchy, unreliable, and questionable at best. I saw this DVD and decided to go with it.

There were some very interesting interview included, such as those with former patients, current property owners, and current and former employees. I was disappointed to find that many of the other interviewees were providing myths and speculations presented as facts. There were also some nice pieces of paranormal investigative evidence presented, like EVPs and photos that I had not seen before.

I left the video (I don't want to call it a ""documentary"" because there were many parts that were the furthest things from that) feeling underwhelmed. I was fine with watching it, but I certainly don't feel the urge to own it, or watch it again.
