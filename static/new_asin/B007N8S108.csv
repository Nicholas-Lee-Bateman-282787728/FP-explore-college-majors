8519681,3,B007N8S108,"Interesting but very amateur, just like watching somebody's home movies. I sort of liked it. I did go to sleep during the motel interview in Texas, then woke up when we were halfway across Arizona. Later I went back to hunt out the part I slept through, that part wasn't too bad. The audio could be lots better; sometimes too loud, too soft, or just too much background noise; should have used lapel microphones or handheld mics. On-board camcorder microphone was relied upon too much. But that's my feelings as a pro videographer. Otherwise the story was okay. Just needs to be polished more.",1384473600,,593,4.711538461538462
