8071843,5,B000A10P1I,"I have both seasons and I enjoyed this very much. Spetsnaz is the Russian military term for their special action and anti-terror teams. This TV series is a fictional account of their activites in the war against terror and crime and it centers around one team.

I like the actors and the stories are quite good; with a pro-Russia theme. A European reviewer (in another publication) mocked this show as being ""wishful thinking"" since Russian military forces are more known for their ineffiency and brutality but I think the reviewer missed the point.

Like any TV show in any country, the idea is to entertain and please the audience. I am sure no Russian viewer wants to see ""politics"" in their action shows, just like US viewers would not be comfortable watching a show that accuses American forces of brutality. We should leave that unpatriotic stuff to CNN and the mainstream media!",1135209600,2,885,4.815789473684211
