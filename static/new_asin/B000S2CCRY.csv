2879236,5,B000S2CCRY,The movies are all great and I would recommend them to whomever is familar with the Lone Wolf and Cub TV series.  They are nothing compare to other Japanese or Chinese Samuri movies.  I consider these Itto Ogami movies and TV series to be classic's.,1362268800,,249,4.511111111111111
2879237,5,B000S2CCRY,Like the other Movies of the series they are all outstanding. The actions and sword play is so fast and awsome. Lots of blood and fights. All I can say is you must buy this movie and the rest of this series you will not be sorry. If your a lover of Samuri Sword play you will love this movie.,1285804800,2,292,3.8833333333333333
2879238,2,B000S2CCRY,"Save yourself the Trouble and Time of watching this highlights clip show and get the real Lone Wolf and Cub series it's based on. Same Scenes, better story.

The first three anyway.",1210118400,5,181,4.65625
2879239,5,B000S2CCRY,"Masters of death, rivers of blood and lots of japanese headless bodies squirting blood like high pressure fire hoses. AWESOME!",1206835200,,126,5.35
2879240,5,B000S2CCRY,"I cannot overstate the bloodier-than-thou production of the entire Shogun Assassin series. Lone Wolf fans (like me) can delight in the retelling of the stories in English, and the fine restoration done by AnimEigo, the label releasing this series. I now own all three and totally look forward to the remainder of them coming to DVD.",1192320000,3,332,4.946428571428571
2879241,5,B000S2CCRY,"Shogun Assissin flicks are not just your average samuria flicks, these movies are violent, gory, dark, sick and bloodier then 90% of the horror films out there.

The third in this series is just as good as the previous ones and I actually think I like it more then the second Lightning Swords of death. I think it reminds me more first one with the high action and high energy. In this one Lone Wolf is hired to kill a highly skilled female assassin, and like always roams around the Japanese country side with his son brutally killing anyone who stands in his way.

I also get my comic relief from watching the Shogun Assassin films, I can't help but laugh when I see five limbs go flying across the screen, heads rolling and ninja's that can jump 20 feet high.

These movies are also known for inspiring the Kill Bill movies from Quintin Tarintino so if your a fan you should check these out. They have lots of gore and are very violent. There are decapitations, dismemberment, torture, stabbings, slashings, and rivers of blood.",1188604800,8,1031,4.562162162162162
