4392376,5,B004K4FUWU,"I bought this not knowing that it contained ""if the earth had no moon"" on it.  I had recently seen that on TV and wanted it enough to do a search on Amazon and couldn't find it.  Believe me, if you are a planetary science buff, this DVD is more than worth the price for this one episode alone.  Happy serendipity. Good stuff, great price!",1386374400,2,338,4.1692307692307695
4392377,5,B004K4FUWU,I got this after reading some of the other reviews to used in my Earth Science classroom.  This DVD is wonderful.  Such in-depth information.  I highly recommend it,1374624000,5,164,4.785714285714286
4392378,4,B004K4FUWU,"I am quite enjoying these DVDs. Sure, I've heard much of it before, but I love this kind of show. I play these when I go to bed. Listening to documentaries is like being in class, and that always made me sleepy!  That's NOT to say this is boring; far from it. The narration is calm and interesting, not frenetic.  The visuals are also enjoyable and informative.  And the price couldn't be beat.",1368921600,3,394,4.36986301369863
4392379,5,B004K4FUWU,"I teach earth science and I put this movie on in the background when the kids are working on labs/projects. This video has good information, fun facts and good cg effects so the kids are entertained by it.",1360713600,3,205,4.421052631578948
4392380,5,B004K4FUWU,"I'm a college-level earth science teacher and I find this DVD very useful. I tend to show parts of the DVD every week to help reinforce what I've talked about. Students find the DVD useful because they can 'see' the processes in action. Plus, some students find it the animations quite helpful in grasping concepts since a talking instructor or boring book cannot do those tricks the DVD can. Great resource!",1346716800,12,408,4.76056338028169

8432235,3,B004K4FUWU,got tired of looking at the same damn beach practically the whole second disk. Take a dollar off and keep the second disk.  or at least warn them to actually go to the beach instead of looking at 'the beach' at home  Bob,1397952000,,220,4.093023255813954
