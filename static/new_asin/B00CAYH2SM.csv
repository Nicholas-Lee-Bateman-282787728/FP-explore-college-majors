A company trying to help the world supposely,and the President of the company who's A real idiot and does not realize what he's about to do wrong.

5710171,2,B00CAYH2SM,Another sweet movie from back in the day. Oh wait totally different movie. Now I'm confused. I recommend checking out the real Eve of Destruction with Gregory Hines.,1373414400,,165,4.928571428571429
5710172,2,B00CAYH2SM,"SPOILER WARNING, SPOILER WARNING

""Eve of Destruction"" was originally a mini-series for television, now released as a full-length film. This ""disaster movie"" features, among others, Aleks Paunovic, Treat Williams and Steven Weber. The plot pits unscrupulous profiteers, duped scientists and nave eco-radicals against each other in a race against time to save our planet from complete destruction as an experiment with ""dark energy"" goes terribly wrong.

Despite its annoying stereotypes, ""Eve of Destruction"" is a tolerable action/drama movie...for about one hour. Then the characters just gets too stereotyped, the plot too illogical, and the tempo too slow-paced. Imagine a slow-paced film featuring the death of 500,000 people in the city of Denver...

Boooom!

Note also the subtle anti-environmentalist message. The eco-radicals are terrorists and call themselves Occupy the World. They, too, are somehow to blame for the explosion of the Mad Scientist Generator. In the end, the duped scientists and the sweet little eco-terrorist Ruby (who just wanted to save the planet and get a boyfriend) hug each other, since we are all to blame, blah blah.

Yepp, doesn't that just break your heart. As a concession to reality, the real crooks get away in the end, planning to build a new ""dark energy"" reactor somewhere in the Third World instead...

Only two stars, Mr. Covert Brownlash.",1372809600,7,1385,5.359447004608295
5710173,5,B00CAYH2SM,Could the scenario in this terrific film actually happen? Stranger things have! Another big-budget-looking film with never a dull moment. Steven Weber and Treat Williams are a pleasure to watch.,1372204800,,194,5.5
5710174,4,B00CAYH2SM,"This was originally a ""made for TV"" movie. While I watched it for Aleks Paunovic (who was awesome!), I was very impressed with the entire cast. I'm not a physicist so I can't vouch for the validity of the ""science"" but the plot was good and the movie kept up a good pace to keep my attention.",1366243200,20,292,4.140350877192983
5710175,3,B00CAYH2SM,"This is NOT a natural disaster movie. This movie is about the foolishness of mankind as a whole, cooperate greed as a side line and the dangers of lying on all levels. This is a two part mini-series where scientist delve into new areas without following the proper safeguards. When that is happening, what can the endangered members of society do to stop this disaster. The storyline is good but the acting should have been much better. This is a excellent family movie that will give parents a golden opportunity to teach there children about right and wrong and decision making.",1409270400,5,580,4.752475247524752

5710177,1,B00CAYH2SM,"Two parts for a movie that should have been 30 minutes.  I purchased Blue Ray hoping that at $12 I would enjoy the special effects.  There were some nice blue colors but the special effects are nothing great.  Perhaps if you surf the internet while you watch the movie as I am doing now, the experience will not be so painful.  So many cliches, so slow.  Please don't subject yourself to this.",1400025600,5,393,4.402777777777778

5710179,1,B00CAYH2SM,"Unlike a really good disaster film like Exploding Sun, this one bogs down in characters with little to no action. The characters become so tedious that one wants them all to perish in a disaster. No such luck.",1388620800,,209,4.526315789473684

5710181,4,B00CAYH2SM,"This movie surprised me I never heard of it before, but it was a fairly good movie for a B picture. I won't spoil the story line all I will say is science fiction fans will enjoy it and another surprise no gore thank God, give it a try people.",1387497600,,243,3.88
5710182,5,B00CAYH2SM,Arrival was right on the time it was said to arrive. Was in great condition. The movie it was was well thought out. The characters were well cast to the rolls and they played the rolls as I expected they would. Was intriguing and very exciting thru out the movie. Hope to see more of this story lines type of thinking and originality. I would recommend this movie definitely.,1387152000,,375,4.449275362318841
5710183,4,B00CAYH2SM,"this is like many disaster tv mini series you have seen before. However this one does feature very good special effects and a different twist. They attempt to use dark matter to create energy. Dark matter wasn't even known until recently. It's the invisible substance that holds the universe together and holds our galaxy in place.  without it , we'd spin off into space.  it's all around us but we can't see it. and is subatomic maybe. So this is a new twist in doctor who in 1970 , they attempt to drill to the center of the earth. And like that show it goes all wrong here , only on a huge scale.  the Acting is done is a serious manner and is lead by the excellent steven weber , in the lead place. Treat Williams is very good as the likeable but totally corrupt businessman villain, and the rest of the cast do a fine job. This was shown on reelz here and it was made in Canada. Although it takes place in Denver, Colorado. Which actually does have a radioactive sight near it! Denver also has allowed frakking nearby which has done damage to peoples lives as well. So this place being near Denver makes sense.  I saw this in Hd, so that's the way to see it. On dvd it will look good but not near as good as hd. There are many scenes that are really well done in hd and the sets are impressive. WIll they save the world? , well this is a better show than some made for tv films for sure, watch it and find out.",1377475200,9,1415,4.134545454545455

8579398,1,B00CAYH2SM,Way to slow omg!  The story seemed interesting but at halfway thru the first episode they hadn't even got to testing the device yet let alone destroying the planet.  Never made it past there.,1527206400,,191,4.588235294117647
