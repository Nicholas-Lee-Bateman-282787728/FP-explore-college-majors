7788639,2,0767011422,"This is a copy of an old A&E 'Biography' program, starring Peter Graves.  It is way too much Peter Graves and not nearly enough Jonathan Winters.  The Amazon listing and the description are misleading in that they don't tell you this.  I was hoping for  a good compilation of Jonathan Winters live, but this was very spotty; more of his life, growing up, etc. I guess that's in keeping with the 'Biography' series, but the description gives no hint of that.  The PBS program 'On the Loose' was much funnier, with more actual routines.",972777600,14,534,4.638297872340425
