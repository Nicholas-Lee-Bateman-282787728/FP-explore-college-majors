8264238,5,B0016XR5QC,"If you want a no nonsense and extreme metal video this is it. The stage show and members let you know this is going to be killer. The collecters tin rocks. Wait till you hear the vocals and poundung music, you will then realize that to supress them is to deny freedom of religion!",1220054400,3,280,4.203703703703703
8264239,5,B0016XR5QC,"If you're a fan of Gorgoroth, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this DVD.  The production quality is spot-on.  Everything looks and sounds great.  Hell, even for a live production, the production value on this disc outshines a lot of black metal studio productions.  With a setlist that covers most Gorgoroth releases, fans of older and newer Gorgoroth should all be pleased.  Sure, the status quo decries this show for including 40 or so real severed sheep heads, 80 liters of blood, as well as hooded people on crosses...but you know what?  If you're reading this because you like black metal and you like Gorgoroth, you honestly couldn't care less about what the status quo thinks.  Some OK special features...two older live performance clips, band bios (though it doesn't include any info about the recent divisions in the Gorgoroth camp...but all of that may've happened after the info was compiled for the DVD), discography, and multiple photo galleries.  Great DVD, great band, and probably one of the most gleefully evil concerts I've ever watched...severed heads, blood, fire, naked people on crosses...what more do you need?!?",1218672000,10,1141,5.064171122994653
