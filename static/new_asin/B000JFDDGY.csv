8150156,4,B000JFDDGY,i buy tango discs all the time.  i've got most of them.  some times you get what you pay for.  some times you are disappointed.  i paid a reasonable price for this.  less than a tango class.  and i got a couple of moves out of this disc and i have been dancing tango for 16 years now.  if you are adv beginner/ int then this is worth the money. of course it pays to shop.  i wasn't disappointed with the disc and as the owner of over forty tango dvds i would recommend to a friend.,1424649600,,481,3.88659793814433
