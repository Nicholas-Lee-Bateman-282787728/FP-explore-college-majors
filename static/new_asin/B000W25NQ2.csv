8221028,4,B000W25NQ2,"Aside from the First Strike DVD, these DVDs that came with the toys are all the fans of this show might get as far as having episodes released on DVD. Luckily, they went with one of the better ones for this DVD. ""Honor"" has lots of ninja action from both Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow plus the apprentices who usually don't get to see as much action as the other characters. The writing for some of the episode is also a little better than 4Kids usually comes up with (in an attempt to not spoil it, the finally scene actually impressed me a bit). However, not only is there just one episode, that's all you get. No extras of any kind, which I love in DVDs. Still worth a shot just for the episode.",1234569600,2,696,4.201492537313433
