3047887,5,B00105308I,"I am greatly gratified to see ""Imaginationland"" on DVD as a stand-alone feature. This originally aired as a three-part episode of South Park, and I felt at the time that it could easily have been the second threatrical release movie based on the series. The three episodes comprised my favorite television program of all 2007, and along with ""Team America,"" stands as Matt and Trey's best work.

""Imaginationland"" shares its basic premise with Clifford D. Simak's 1970 science fiction novel ""Out of Their Minds."" It's based on the concept that imaginary characters and beings from myth, legend, folklore, and fiction all exist in literal reality, co-existing together in some alternate dimension, owing to the power of the mental energy focused on them by the collective human imagination. South Park started out as simple shock-jock type humor and matured into genuinely brilliant social satire. With ""Imaginationland,"" it offers some genuinely touching and moving moments and at times achieves an epic sweep and grandeur, all without sacrificing its characteristic laugh-out-loud raunchy humor. ""Imaginationland"" may not by South Park's funniest episode, but it is arguably its finest.

[SPOILER ALERT: I found ""Imaginationland"" thought-provoking enough to critique at some length, but this does entail a brief synopsis of the main plot points.]

The story begins as Eric Cartman, the world's most malevolent 8-year-old, has enlisted the other boys to capture a leprechaun he has seen. Cartman has made a bet with Kyle that Kyle will such Cartman's balls if Cartman can prove leprechauns exist. The leprechaun does appear, to the amazement of all, and gives a warning about terrorists before vanishing. Cartman spends the rest of the story attempting to coerce Kyle into fulfilling the terms of the bet.

Later, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Jimmy, and Butters meet the Mayor of Imaginationland who is seeking the leprechaun. He takes the boys on a trip to Imaginationland. [Check out the Wikipedia entries for Imaginationland for a complete tally of the imaginary beings who appear in the saga.] Soon after they arrive, terrorists invade to sow death and destruction. The boys escape, but Butters is left behind. The terrorists wreck the wall that keeps out all the most evil beings ever imagined by humans, and these now threaten to overrun the good part of Imaginationland. Back in the real world, the US military has learned that ""terrorists have seized control of our imagination"" and contemplate attacking Imaginationland through a Stargate.

They are forestalled by Kyle, who makes a moving speech about how imaginary characters are ""real"" in the sense that they touch all our lives. Yet the real hero of the story is Butters. My favorite South Park character, Butters is the antithesis of Cartman; he is a sweet, good-natured little kid who is, sadly, not appreciated by his idiot parents. As a real human being in Imaginationland, Butters is a ""creator,"" able to alter things in that world by using his imagination. Butters is able to raise Santa Claus from the dead and is soon bolstering the forces of good imaginary beings in their battle against the evil forces.

Which brings me to an important point: ""Imaginationland"" illustrates one of the key advantages Good enjoys over Evil. Cartman enters Imaginationland only at the end of the story. He is instantly able to use his imagination to create doppelgangers of himself and Kyle, so as to see Kyle fulfill the terms of the bet. Butters, on the other hand, had to slowly learn to use his power. Also, Cartman was the first of the boys to see an imaginary being (the leprechaun). The satanic Woodland Critters from Cartman's Christmas story in a previous episode are among the most formidable beings in the evil part of Imaginationland. Yet the Critters were created by Cartman, and known only to himself and his fourth grade class--whereas the other evil beings --Frankenstein, Alien, et al-- are part of the imaginary lives of millions. ALL THIS INDICATES THAT CARTMAN IS MORE POWERFUL THAN BUTTERS! Possessed of an extemely forceful personality, Cartman has swayed entire mobs of adults in past episodes. HAD THE EVIL FORCES OF IMAGINATIONLAND BEEN ABLE TO RECRUIT CARTMAN, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TRIUMPHANT. However, Cartman remains totally fixated on his silly bet with Kyle and is unable to see beyond it, taking no notice of the momentous events that whirl about him. One of the weaknesses of evil is pettiness, and it is pettiness that nullifies Cartman's power full evil.

I posit that it is Butters, not Kyle, who is Cartman's true nemesis. Cartman is moved to attempt to humiliate Butters in many episodes because he subconsciously feels threatened by Butters' goodness. Butters is so nice that he can only express anger by creating a seperate persona, Professor Chaos. But that's another topic. Interestingly, Butters sometimes appears almost in the capacity of Cartman's sidekick. He is the only one of the boys to call Cartman ""Eric."" Perhaps Butters can, Christlike, steer Cartman onto a better path. Cartman has been shown to be effective when using his powers for good, as when he pulls Kyle back from the brink of death following an attack by ManBearPig.

Gripping, moving, and thoughtprovoking as it is funny, ""Imaginationland"" is epic in its scope. It's great to see it on DVD, packaged as a stand alone feature, and I honestly feel that it rated a theatrical release.",1205193600,3,5440,5.083986562150056

3047891,5,B00105308I,"If anyone has ever had any doubt whatsoever of the sheer, underrated brilliance of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, then they must see the Imaginationland Trilogy.  It all begins with a bet between Cartman and Kyle over the existance of leprechauns, and soon enough, all the boys find themselves transported to the mysterious land of Imaginationland; an alternate dimension where all the made-up characters from TV, cartoons, movies, video games, and comic books live.  Everything goes well, until Imaginationland is attacked by terrorists, which leads to Butters being imprisoned, Stan racing against time, and Cartman going to great lengths to get Kyle to...well, you'll just have to see it if you didn't catch it when it originally aired.  Possibly some of the funniest stuff you'll ever see on South Park, the Imaginationland Trilogy is shockingly brilliant to the point of almost being a satire.  Other elements, such as the return of the demonic Woodland Christmas Critters and a Stargate spoof with a faux-Kurt Russell, will leave you rolling around on the floor laughing.  Whether or not purchasing this DVD, or waiting for the entire season set, is entirely up to you, but make no mistake; the Imaginationland Trilogy is the most inspired, hysterical, and smart episodes to come from South Park in quite some time.",1199750400,20,1338,5.1192660550458715
3047892,5,B00105308I,"""The Imaginationland Trilogy"" is a series of 3 eps from Season Eleven. These eps (especially the first) were a huge hit for Comedy Central & ""South Park"" which saw it's highest ratings ever.

These are the three shows that this DVD includes:

Imaginationland, 10/17/2007
The boys find out that it's not always fun in Imaginationland when some terrorists pop up.

Imaginationland: Episode II, 10/24/2007
Kyle and Stan are at the Pentagon. Carton will stop at nothing to get Kyle to ""pay up"" and give his balls a lick-job.

Imaginationland: Episode III, 10/31/2007
Stan and Butters fight against the evils of some of the most devious Imaginationland characters.

""The Imaginationland Trilogy"" had some of my favorite eps from Season Eleven. Although my favorite ""South Park"" ep ever has to be ""D-Yikes!"" (aka ""Les' Bos,"") which is also from Season Eleven. Do you remember this one? Mrs. Garrison learned the fine art of scissoring.

Anway, I really liked these three eps because the stories were so detailed and varied. It wasn't a typical ""to be continued"" trilogy. But as you already know, there isn't anything typical about ""South Park.""",1198972800,14,1138,5.0588235294117645

3047926,5,B00105308I,"Long term fans thought this two-part special was a contrived and overly redundant way of making a point about organized religions--that they can all coexist because they all imaginational.  In other words, it was an extended comment that religion was a bunch of BS.  That's the surface level.  They've made this statement many times, with equanimity, poking fun of Mormonism, Scientology and Catholocism alike.

On a deeper more symbolic level--which may or may not have been their intention (which would make them accidental geniuses, but given TP and MS's studiousness regarding the musical Book of Mormon, I don't think so.. )--they are making a statement about the occult and the people who involve themselves in it.  Without giving spoilers just a synopsis, the kids discover that singing a song in an exact type of way opens a door to another dimension...essentially its not a song, but steps to follow, a recipe to do something unlikely.  What they are doing is ritual magic, or they think they are.  This gets them entry into a world of both angels and demons, the world of imagination where rules are bent and anything is possible.  Then of course the military gets involved.

SP is making a statement about the occult and the connection to the occult in intelligence agencies specifically.  This is their way of shining a light on past, alleged military research projects such as the montauk chair in project looking glass (which some say was the basis of the movie contact), in which it is said we opened a doorway through which demons came into our world (the very basis of imaginationland).

In the same way that SP creators kind of poke fun in an anti-conpiracism way, they also bring it up.  Given that 'what you resist you persist', it's almost as if they want us to take a look at this again, when we the scientism fanpeople of America pretty much thought that chapter was closed.  I wonder what they are trying to say?

My opinion is they want us to expand our consciousness by playing with the idea that 'imaginationland' may be just as real as 'realityland', or to make us aware that there are people who do believe that statement to be so.

The fact that there is this polarity of concept makes TP and MS true alchemists in their storytelling.  They aren't necessarily telling you that religion is flat out BS, but they are telling you that all truths are half-truths and every truth is half false.  That imagination land is both imaginary and real is a paradox, but given the last statment could possibly also be true.",1421625600,2,2540,4.736363636363636

Imagination Land is the second film produced in this series, and this one was direct-to-video. The story was very clever, drawing on passed episodes and parodying just about everything you can imagine, but the supporting story really brought down the film. For the entire movie, Cartman is obsessed with a side bet he and Kyle have. The joke wasn't that funny to begin with and they just won't let it go! They carry on and on and on about it, getting to the point where you're really just sick of it.

3047947,5,B00105308I,"Done in 2007, this DVD combines the three Imaginationland episodes to form a motion picture called ""South Park Imaginationland"", whose length and animation quality is even more impressive to what ""South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" did in 1999. In ImaginationLand, the South Park kids ironically find themselves at the center of a war between the forces of good and evil that live in our imagination, though the kid that stands out of the lot is Butters, who becomes the ""Key"" in the battle that awaits. Then again, Cartman and Kyle's conflict really creates in parallel a tension as I was wondering whether or not Kyle would do what Cartman wrote in his contract. Would Kyle do it, would he not, it was just funny!

As the story happens in our imagination, the movie offers cameos from characters coming from our pop culture, such as Predator, Alien, Freddy, Astro Boy, Harry Potter, Wonder Woman, Gandalf, Care Bear, Obelix, Popeye, Gandalf, and even Aslan. Personally, I was amazed at the number of characters Trey Parker and Matt Stone were allowed to show, though some must not have had the chance of saying dialogues due to Copyright reasons. Anyway, the movie also offers the return of the Critter Christmas, very popular characters in the South Park series whose appearance in the episode ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" astonished the fans.

Speaking of those characters, it is nice to see that the creators put, as bonus features, some episodes with characters that were involved in the movie's plot line, but whose presence could be confusing to viewers who maybe did not saw the episodes related to them. As such, we have both Woodland Critter Christmas and Manbearpig episodes. Not only that, the creators offer their commentary and some storyboards for scenes that they used for ImaginationLand.

For the commentary, it is important to know that right at the start, Trey Parker and Matt Stone explain that the makers of the DVD censor their commentaries, either because what they said is illegal/offensive or because Paramount and Comedy Central could get sued. So as they say at the start of the commentary, a music track from the show covers all the censored comments. Personally, it would have been nice to have had a little memo identifying at which minute of the movie the commentary would be censored. But then again it is funny to hear the creators provoke their TV channel and Paramount with their comments about Tom Cruise and Scientology that get censored ironically in an uncensored cut of the movie, which is hypocritical for Comedy Central and Paramount.

Technically, the animation quality is excellent and the 3D visual effects are very good for the short time span the creators had to do their episodes since they produce all their episodes in just a week, though they can have ideas formed weeks or months earlier, or just days before the episodes are to be shot. Still, I wonder if we will ever get the same movie, but in Blu-Ray.

In the end, this movie is another reason that proves South Park deserves its success, but also shows how Comedy Central and Paramount put obstacles in the work of some of their most popular shows.",1355184000,,3161,4.857142857142857
3047948,1,B00105308I,"Is this only for region 4 Australia?  Or am I the only person to notice.  Compared to the Season 11 DVD, the 4:3 picture has been cropped.  They cut off the top and bottom of the picture.  How is that widescreen?  It's the way DVDs were done in 1999 but in 2008?  I wish the DVD producers would explain what they were thinking.  I wondered if the 16:9 version would be a crop of the original 4:3, but I cannot believe it is still 4:3 but cropped!  On a 16:9 TV with an upconverting to 1080 DVD player, it plays with letterboxing and pillarboxing.  Pressing zoom just cuts more of the picture off.  Why wasn't it anamorphic?  Are people supposed to prefer this?  I compared directly on a computer screen the Season 11 version and the DVD standalone one, and the cropping was obvious.  To watch this properly, I would have to reset my player to output 576p for SDTV, then zoom to 14:9.  The same as for the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine.  I can't bother about the slight cropping that still occurs of the picture.  This might be an 'old' copy, but it would be from 2008, because I got it from a mail DVD service like Netflix.  I discovered contradictory information searching on the web.  Many saying it is anamorphic, while the copy I have clearly is not.  Some saying it is 4:3 cropped.",1353542400,2,1289,4.362869198312236

3047952,4,B00105308I,"At the end of South Park season 11, viewers were watching in suspense as an epic trilogy unfolded-that trilogy was Imaginationland. Starting off with Cartman and Kyle's bet involving Kyle gently sucking on Cartman's pubicle sack and culminating in a battle worth of Two Towers, it's just as awesome as it was months ago.

The ""feature"" (it's called a feature, but it's blatantly obvious it's still three episodes) begins with Cartman betting Kyle that leprachauns do exist, and if they do, Kyle has to finally suck Cartman's balls. Against all odds, the boys spy a leprachaun, who warns them of an ominous terrorist attack. The next day at school a strangely dressed man approaches the boys, and tells them to come with him on his balloon to Imaginationland. It seems the leprachaun was right, as Imaginationland is quickly attacked by terrorists. The US government works to stop the terrorists, while Cartman works at getting Kyle to honor his ball-sucking bet. The two stories intertwine, and thus the epic trilogy is born.

In recent years, South Park had begun to be less about comedy, and more about on-the-ball social and cultural commentary. Where earlier seasons featured a few episodes of true meaning mixed in among ones purely for entertainment, since about season 7 or so, things began to shift. Imaginationland goes right back to the classic South Park formula, as there's really nothing in terms of social lessons and satire outside of their classic pop-culture pokes.

From making fun of Michael Bay to poking fun at Jesus, Trey and Matt (and special guest writer Brad Neely, best known for Wizard People, Dear Reader; The Professor Brothers; and the George Washington Rap) are on top of their game.

If you're a fan of South Park or grew up on 80s and 90s cartoons and comics, Imaginationland has it all. You'll spend lots of time pausing the DVD on the scenes filled with characters in Imaginationland, trying to figure out who you spy. (That also makes a great party game if you can find a way to make it more entertaining, I suspect.) While there are some slow periods-and some outright awkward ones where Cartman pulls a Stewie Griffin and comes off as extremely gay-in the end the arc is an entirely joyous watch, and one that any fan of South Park-past or present-will enjoy thoroughly.

As a standalone DVD, it's a little hard to justify purchase for diehard fans, as you'll probably pick up the season once it's available in stores. It's a great buy for casual likers of South Park as it provides five brilliant episodes on one disc, but if you're a fanatic like me, I'd recommend just waiting for the entire season rather than buying the same things twice.

CONTENT - 4.5/5

Three of the more memorable South Park's in recent memory, and the three greatest-period--in terms of pop-culture references. You'll be singing ""Imaginayyyyy-tion!"" for days and days, pissing your neighbors off so much that they may wish for an actual terrorist attack on Imaginationland. If you've ever seen a South Park and thought ""That was funny!"" you'll love this.

VIDEO - 4/5

It's a DVD release of a TV show, so there's nothing too remarkable here. A few lines here and there, but nothing too noticeable. All of the cameos are one of the highlights, so keep an eye out for that off-color Optimus Prime, or that guy that looks suspiciously like Mario.

AUDIO - 3/5

It's uncensored, meaning no bleeping. Much like with other South Parks, though, the uncensoring takes away from a lot of the humor. It's just not as funny when Cartman goes on a rant without the constant bleeping obscuring every other word. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer my South Park censored; it's part of the charm and humor.

EXTRAS - 4/5

The audio commentary from Matt and Trey on here is by far the most I've ever heard them do for any episodes; we're talking about 50 minutes of commentary. They talk about inspirations for the arc to what made them do it to just general observations as we watch, and it's got their usual Matt and Trey wit. In addition, the DVD also comes packaged with the Woodland Critters Christmas episode and Manbearpig. The two play a central role in the story, so that's for those of you who might not have seen them the first time around. It's only two episodes, but they're two of the best.

REPLAY - 5/5

I've watched this at least five times now. You always notice something new, and like every good episode of South Park, the humor stands up to multiple viewings quite well.

OVERALL - 4/5

Imaginationland is easily the greatest thing to come out of Matt and Trey's mind in years, and the DVD shows that. If there's one downside to the entire thing, it's that if you're going to buy season 11 anyway, it almost seems like a waste of money to get it. For casual watchers and friends who don't want to own every episode on DVD, Imaginationland is a must-buy. For the regular viewers, rent it to check it out as a feature, listen to the commentary, then just grab season 11.",1249689600,,4986,4.68649885583524

3047966,5,B00105308I,"In its DVD form it's presented as a feature length movie but within season 11 it's simply 3 epic South Park episodes. The story begins with Cartman trying to prove to Kyle that he saw a leprechaun, and he made a bet that if he can prove they exist Kyle has to suck Cartmans balls. After setting a number of traps Cartman does manage to catch his leprechaun and prove to Kyle their existence, but it's at a cost and that cost is our imagination. The Leprechaun that they caught was on his way to warn the Imaginationland residents about a planned terrorist attack on our imagination. The gang are picked up by an eccentric character who takes them to imaginationland; after a wonderful and annoying song which is the key to our Imagination, the boys are taken into this world with all characters ever created by our imagination including Popeye, Luke Skywalker & Jesus.

In my opinion these episodes were easily the best that South Park has to offer and they gave us some of the more witty one liners that we've ever heard from South Park. The imagery is brilliant as the imaginary characters have you roaring with laughter with the situations that they find themselves in. A Care Bear being shot in the head and decapitated & Jason from the Friday the 13th movies saying he wouldn't want to meet the guy who thought of the woodland critters (Cartman)

These were truly a hysterical set of episodes and I would have loved to have seen them put this on the big screen as a genuine sequel to their first movie. Whether this was a movie or just 3 great episodes, either way I would recommend this product as it will have you roaring with laughter from the very first minute.",1208476800,3,1670,4.508250825082508
3047967,5,B00105308I,"I have been watching South Park ever since the pilot episode came out on the Internet when I was in the 6th grade, and I think I have seen every episode since.  Needless to say, I'm a big fan.  When the Imaginationland trilogy first aired, I thought to myself, ""wow, they could easily just combine it all into a movie and sell it on DVD, I'd buy it"".  My thinking was on par with Matt Stone and Trey Parker, because sure enough a month or two later I saw the ad for the Imaginationland DVD, and bought it instantly. This movie has all the great elements of a South Park episode: Cartman going out of his way to get what he wants (Kyle as always being the culprit), countless allusions to current events (which is why the show has been so successful for so long), and of course any character you can think of that's ever been created as part of Imaginationland.  The Woodland critters are back, which is incredible.  To keep this short, if you like South Park, buy this...if you saw even one episode on the trilogy, buy this, if you've never heard of South Park, buy this..it's that good.",1208304000,2,1087,4.361386138613861
3047968,3,B00105308I,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone reportedly became fascinated with the narrative arcs of shows like ""24"" and ""Lost"" and, so, with ""Imaginationland,"" attempted to create three connected episodes of ""South Park."" It works better than it sounds.

The South Park kids discovered a land where imaginary creatures intermingle  -- survey the landscape and you'll see the Peanuts gang, Strawberry Shortcake, Snarf from Thundercats, Tron warriors among countless others, all bouncing around happily. No sooner have they arrived than terrorists attack and open the floodgates for the darker, more violent characters.

Meanwhile, the B-plot involves Kyle losing a bet with Cartman and, to fulfill the wager, he's required to perform an act that probably won't pass amazon standards (it rhymes with ""fleabag"" but the boys use far more direct terms).

Parker and Stone jump through all the storytelling hoops, ably ape and satirize ""24,"" present a valid though somewhat on-the-nose argument (""the terrorists have hijacked our imagination""), pull off one hilarious ""Saving Private Ryan"" gag and deliver some of the meanest fuzzy critters ever captured on film. What they do to Raggedy Ann is ... unspeakable ... and extremely funny.

I'm not a huge South Park fan -- I usually enjoy it but don't really go out of my way to see it -- but this was a solid, inventive, beautifully brutal trilogy of comedy.

But my favorite part of the disk is the commentary with Stone and Parker, which describes (in their chatty, profane, occasionally censored style) how they pulled the story threads together on deadline, how they dodged legal issues and -- after eviscerating him post-""Passion"" -- tell us that they really do kind of like Mel Gibson and think ""Apocalypto"" is better than all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, save ""The Sixth Sense.""

They're right. And they're funny. And it's highly listenable. But this may be the first commentary I've ever heard where the commentators simply get tired of talking and turn off the microphone ten minutes before the story ends. Which is, of course, kind of funny, too.",1208217600,3,2084,5.093841642228739

This DVD is a perfect example of what happens when original, creative, inventive people start to run out of ideas. I was disappointed in the first episode, puzzled why they made a second episode out of it, and amazed that they stretched it to three. This is not good work.

There are still good ideas and inspired moments to be found on South Park, but they're becoming fewer and farther between as time goes on. Parker and Stone are far more original and creative than I'll ever be and I think their work has been wonderful for many years; as evidence I have a nice collection of South Park on my shelf. But it's hard to excel forever, faced with the need to be fresh and inventive every single week. They've been so good for so long that I hate to see them go out with a whimper. Imaginationland is a whimper.",1207785600,5,985,4.324324324324325
3047970,5,B00105308I,"SOUTH PARK has only been seen on the big screen once.  Despite topically relevant humor and episodes that are large in scope, the series rarely even does two-part shows.  In October 2007, the series gave fans the closest thing they are probably ever going to get to another SOUTH PARK movie with the three-part series originally titles as ""Kyle Sucks Cartman's Balls"" but is now being marketed as the ""Imaginationland"" trilogy.

This three-part series begins with Cartman and most of the rest of the crew hunting in the forest for a leprechaun.  Cartman swears he saw a leprechaun and vows to catch it. Kyle doesn't believe him and signed a note that if a leprechaun actually existed, he would suck Cartman's balls.  Sure enough a leprechaun is spotted and Cartman's crew attempts to capture it.  However, leprechauns have magic powers and it escapes. It tells the boys that it was on a mission to warn them about a terrorist attack.  Well, one thing lead to another and Stan, Kyle, Butters, Kenny, and Jimmy find themselves on a floating balloon with a strange man who takes them to Imaginationland.  The boys are asked what the leprechaun told them, but just as they are about to speak, Imaginationland is attack by terrorists.  The boys escape on a talking dragon, but Butters is left behind.  They waken in the morning and when talking to each other realize they all had the same dream. Not only that, but Butters is missing.  It's then that the boys realize that it couldn't have all just been a dream and that terrorists have actually attacked our imagination. What follows is an epic tale as the terrorist blow apart the wall that separates the good part of Imaginationland from the bad part.  A massive war begins, the government captures Stan and Kyle to find out why Butters was talking about them, and Cartman sues to force Kyle to suck his balls.

The story is massive in scope and one of the more entertaining things to do is watch the scenes that take place in Imaginationland and try to spot the different characters.  South Park does a lot of parodies and is often satirical so the show can get away with a lot more than many others.  The show includes characters from television, films, comic books, and even advertising.  I did notice that there were no Disney characters, Warner Brothers (such as Bugs Bunny), DC (Superman, Batman, etc.) or Marvel (X-Men, Spider-man, etc.) that I could see.  I guess even Matt Stone and Trey Parker have certain legal boundaries that even they can't cross. Overall, the Imaginationland story-arc is one of the best SOUTH PARK episodes in the past three seasons.

The DVD includes a commentary with Matt and Trey.  If you have any of the recent season releases of SOUTH PARK or the special episode DVDs, you're familiar with the mini-commentaries that the duo usually provides.  With most episodes they talk for 3-8 minutes and that's it.  On SOUTH PARK IMAGINATIONLAND the duo talks for almost forty minutes.  The DVD also includes a few storyboards as well as two extra episodes ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" from season eight and ""Manbearpig"" from season ten.  In the Imaginationland story, the Woodland Critters return to torture creatures in Imaginationland and Manbearpig escapes through a portal into the ""real"" world, causing Al Gore to go hysterical.

Overall, if you're a casual fan of SOUTH PARK or if you really, really, really liked the story arc, you may want to pick up IMAGINATIONLAND. If not, I'd wait until the Season 11 SOUTH PARK DVD set is released.",1207440000,8,3521,4.800995024875622
3047971,4,B00105308I,"Despite the fact that South Park has maintained a level of consistency in its humor for years (as opposed to Simpsons and Family Guy which confuses pedestrian humor and shock value without comedy or wit, respectively), I haven't really watched the show in their original broadcasts with my lack of Comedy Central on my TV. I'd usually just watch an episode whenever it was on or if I got into a ""mood"" for the show so upon seeing this at the store, I thought I'd give it a shot. While this isn't exactly South Park the movie 2, the scope, animation and length is certainly ambitious and it's just as hilarious and even satirical as the show's best episodes.

Cartman has started a bet with Kyle: if he can prove leprechauns exist, Kyle has to suck Cartman's balls, if not, Kyle gets 10$. Well much to their surprise, a leprechaun does show up only to warn them of an impending terrorist attack. The group, sans Cartman, is whisked away to Imaginationland where magical and popular characters reside. But the attack happens and everyone but Butters escapes so they have to save Imaginationland from the US Government while Kyle tries to avoid giving in on his bet to suck Cartman's balls.

A lot of what made South Park's humor work so well was getting you to laugh at things you wouldn't normally laugh at yet still maintain a sense of irony or satire that made it go beyond a simple joke. So a line like ""the terrorists are attacking our imagination"" works simply as a good line but also noting the US's tendency to have anti-terrorism/pro-America statements everywhere they could. Then of course there's my favorite line: ""wow, that is incredible, and totally ****ed up at the same time"" which can also describe the show's humor oddly enough. From references to films like Saving Private Ryan, the Abyss, as well as familiar film and TV characters, there's a lot to the episodes that makes it fun.

Bear in mind though there's a reason the show is so controversial and thanks to this DVD, it's as gory and profanity-laced as Bigger, Longer and Uncut was though there's not as much toe-tapping songs, just one...""unimaginative"" one. As far as extras you get the episodes ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" and ""Manbearpig"" which get featured in the main film, as well as a longer-than-usual commentary (not full length, sadly) with the creators.

For South Park fans, this is a good tiding over until the next season comes out and it's fun to have it on one package.",1206403200,,2461,4.703016241299304

3282384,5,B00105308I,"I am greatly gratified to see ""Imaginationland"" on DVD as a stand-alone feature. This originally aired as a three-part episode of South Park, and I felt at the time that it could easily have been the second threatrical release movie based on the series. The three episodes comprised my favorite television program of all 2007, and along with ""Team America,"" stands as Matt and Trey's best work.

""Imaginationland"" shares its basic premise with Clifford D. Simak's 1970 science fiction novel ""Out of Their Minds."" It's based on the concept that imaginary characters and beings from myth, legend, folklore, and fiction all exist in literal reality, co-existing together in some alternate dimension, owing to the power of the mental energy focused on them by the collective human imagination. South Park started out as simple shock-jock type humor and matured into genuinely brilliant social satire. With ""Imaginationland,"" it offers some genuinely touching and moving moments and at times achieves an epic sweep and grandeur, all without sacrificing its characteristic laugh-out-loud raunchy humor. ""Imaginationland"" may not by South Park's funniest episode, but it is arguably its finest.

[SPOILER ALERT: I found ""Imaginationland"" thought-provoking enough to critique at some length, but this does entail a brief synopsis of the main plot points.]

The story begins as Eric Cartman, the world's most malevolent 8-year-old, has enlisted the other boys to capture a leprechaun he has seen. Cartman has made a bet with Kyle that Kyle will such Cartman's balls if Cartman can prove leprechauns exist. The leprechaun does appear, to the amazement of all, and gives a warning about terrorists before vanishing. Cartman spends the rest of the story attempting to coerce Kyle into fulfilling the terms of the bet.

Later, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Jimmy, and Butters meet the Mayor of Imaginationland who is seeking the leprechaun. He takes the boys on a trip to Imaginationland. [Check out the Wikipedia entries for Imaginationland for a complete tally of the imaginary beings who appear in the saga.] Soon after they arrive, terrorists invade to sow death and destruction. The boys escape, but Butters is left behind. The terrorists wreck the wall that keeps out all the most evil beings ever imagined by humans, and these now threaten to overrun the good part of Imaginationland. Back in the real world, the US military has learned that ""terrorists have seized control of our imagination"" and contemplate attacking Imaginationland through a Stargate.

They are forestalled by Kyle, who makes a moving speech about how imaginary characters are ""real"" in the sense that they touch all our lives. Yet the real hero of the story is Butters. My favorite South Park character, Butters is the antithesis of Cartman; he is a sweet, good-natured little kid who is, sadly, not appreciated by his idiot parents. As a real human being in Imaginationland, Butters is a ""creator,"" able to alter things in that world by using his imagination. Butters is able to raise Santa Claus from the dead and is soon bolstering the forces of good imaginary beings in their battle against the evil forces.

Which brings me to an important point: ""Imaginationland"" illustrates one of the key advantages Good enjoys over Evil. Cartman enters Imaginationland only at the end of the story. He is instantly able to use his imagination to create doppelgangers of himself and Kyle, so as to see Kyle fulfill the terms of the bet. Butters, on the other hand, had to slowly learn to use his power. Also, Cartman was the first of the boys to see an imaginary being (the leprechaun). The satanic Woodland Critters from Cartman's Christmas story in a previous episode are among the most formidable beings in the evil part of Imaginationland. Yet the Critters were created by Cartman, and known only to himself and his fourth grade class--whereas the other evil beings --Frankenstein, Alien, et al-- are part of the imaginary lives of millions. ALL THIS INDICATES THAT CARTMAN IS MORE POWERFUL THAN BUTTERS! Possessed of an extemely forceful personality, Cartman has swayed entire mobs of adults in past episodes. HAD THE EVIL FORCES OF IMAGINATIONLAND BEEN ABLE TO RECRUIT CARTMAN, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TRIUMPHANT. However, Cartman remains totally fixated on his silly bet with Kyle and is unable to see beyond it, taking no notice of the momentous events that whirl about him. One of the weaknesses of evil is pettiness, and it is pettiness that nullifies Cartman's power full evil.

I posit that it is Butters, not Kyle, who is Cartman's true nemesis. Cartman is moved to attempt to humiliate Butters in many episodes because he subconsciously feels threatened by Butters' goodness. Butters is so nice that he can only express anger by creating a seperate persona, Professor Chaos. But that's another topic. Interestingly, Butters sometimes appears almost in the capacity of Cartman's sidekick. He is the only one of the boys to call Cartman ""Eric."" Perhaps Butters can, Christlike, steer Cartman onto a better path. Cartman has been shown to be effective when using his powers for good, as when he pulls Kyle back from the brink of death following an attack by ManBearPig.

Gripping, moving, and thoughtprovoking as it is funny, ""Imaginationland"" is epic in its scope. It's great to see it on DVD, packaged as a stand alone feature, and I honestly feel that it rated a theatrical release.",1205193600,3,5440,5.083986562150056

Everything goes well, until Imaginationland is attacked by terrorists, which leads to Butters being imprisoned, Stan racing against time, and Cartman going to great lengths to get Kyle to...well, you'll just have to see it if you didn't catch it when it originally aired.  Possibly some of the funniest stuff you'll ever see on South Park, the Imaginationland Trilogy is shockingly brilliant to the point of almost being a satire.

3282423,5,B00105308I,"Long term fans thought this two-part special was a contrived and overly redundant way of making a point about organized religions--that they can all coexist because they all imaginational.  In other words, it was an extended comment that religion was a bunch of BS.  That's the surface level.  They've made this statement many times, with equanimity, poking fun of Mormonism, Scientology and Catholocism alike.

On a deeper more symbolic level--which may or may not have been their intention (which would make them accidental geniuses, but given TP and MS's studiousness regarding the musical Book of Mormon, I don't think so.. )--they are making a statement about the occult and the people who involve themselves in it.  Without giving spoilers just a synopsis, the kids discover that singing a song in an exact type of way opens a door to another dimension...essentially its not a song, but steps to follow, a recipe to do something unlikely.  What they are doing is ritual magic, or they think they are.  This gets them entry into a world of both angels and demons, the world of imagination where rules are bent and anything is possible.  Then of course the military gets involved.

SP is making a statement about the occult and the connection to the occult in intelligence agencies specifically.  This is their way of shining a light on past, alleged military research projects such as the montauk chair in project looking glass (which some say was the basis of the movie contact), in which it is said we opened a doorway through which demons came into our world (the very basis of imaginationland).

In the same way that SP creators kind of poke fun in an anti-conpiracism way, they also bring it up.  Given that 'what you resist you persist', it's almost as if they want us to take a look at this again, when we the scientism fanpeople of America pretty much thought that chapter was closed.  I wonder what they are trying to say?

My opinion is they want us to expand our consciousness by playing with the idea that 'imaginationland' may be just as real as 'realityland', or to make us aware that there are people who do believe that statement to be so.

The fact that there is this polarity of concept makes TP and MS true alchemists in their storytelling.  They aren't necessarily telling you that religion is flat out BS, but they are telling you that all truths are half-truths and every truth is half false.  That imagination land is both imaginary and real is a paradox, but given the last statment could possibly also be true.",1421625600,2,2540,4.736363636363636

3282444,5,B00105308I,"Done in 2007, this DVD combines the three Imaginationland episodes to form a motion picture called ""South Park Imaginationland"", whose length and animation quality is even more impressive to what ""South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" did in 1999. In ImaginationLand, the South Park kids ironically find themselves at the center of a war between the forces of good and evil that live in our imagination, though the kid that stands out of the lot is Butters, who becomes the ""Key"" in the battle that awaits. Then again, Cartman and Kyle's conflict really creates in parallel a tension as I was wondering whether or not Kyle would do what Cartman wrote in his contract. Would Kyle do it, would he not, it was just funny!

As the story happens in our imagination, the movie offers cameos from characters coming from our pop culture, such as Predator, Alien, Freddy, Astro Boy, Harry Potter, Wonder Woman, Gandalf, Care Bear, Obelix, Popeye, Gandalf, and even Aslan. Personally, I was amazed at the number of characters Trey Parker and Matt Stone were allowed to show, though some must not have had the chance of saying dialogues due to Copyright reasons. Anyway, the movie also offers the return of the Critter Christmas, very popular characters in the South Park series whose appearance in the episode ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" astonished the fans.

Speaking of those characters, it is nice to see that the creators put, as bonus features, some episodes with characters that were involved in the movie's plot line, but whose presence could be confusing to viewers who maybe did not saw the episodes related to them. As such, we have both Woodland Critter Christmas and Manbearpig episodes. Not only that, the creators offer their commentary and some storyboards for scenes that they used for ImaginationLand.

For the commentary, it is important to know that right at the start, Trey Parker and Matt Stone explain that the makers of the DVD censor their commentaries, either because what they said is illegal/offensive or because Paramount and Comedy Central could get sued. So as they say at the start of the commentary, a music track from the show covers all the censored comments. Personally, it would have been nice to have had a little memo identifying at which minute of the movie the commentary would be censored. But then again it is funny to hear the creators provoke their TV channel and Paramount with their comments about Tom Cruise and Scientology that get censored ironically in an uncensored cut of the movie, which is hypocritical for Comedy Central and Paramount.

Technically, the animation quality is excellent and the 3D visual effects are very good for the short time span the creators had to do their episodes since they produce all their episodes in just a week, though they can have ideas formed weeks or months earlier, or just days before the episodes are to be shot. Still, I wonder if we will ever get the same movie, but in Blu-Ray.

In the end, this movie is another reason that proves South Park deserves its success, but also shows how Comedy Central and Paramount put obstacles in the work of some of their most popular shows.",1355184000,,3161,4.857142857142857
3282445,1,B00105308I,"Is this only for region 4 Australia?  Or am I the only person to notice.  Compared to the Season 11 DVD, the 4:3 picture has been cropped.  They cut off the top and bottom of the picture.  How is that widescreen?  It's the way DVDs were done in 1999 but in 2008?  I wish the DVD producers would explain what they were thinking.  I wondered if the 16:9 version would be a crop of the original 4:3, but I cannot believe it is still 4:3 but cropped!  On a 16:9 TV with an upconverting to 1080 DVD player, it plays with letterboxing and pillarboxing.  Pressing zoom just cuts more of the picture off.  Why wasn't it anamorphic?  Are people supposed to prefer this?  I compared directly on a computer screen the Season 11 version and the DVD standalone one, and the cropping was obvious.  To watch this properly, I would have to reset my player to output 576p for SDTV, then zoom to 14:9.  The same as for the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine.  I can't bother about the slight cropping that still occurs of the picture.  This might be an 'old' copy, but it would be from 2008, because I got it from a mail DVD service like Netflix.  I discovered contradictory information searching on the web.  Many saying it is anamorphic, while the copy I have clearly is not.  Some saying it is 4:3 cropped.",1353542400,2,1289,4.362869198312236

3282449,4,B00105308I,"At the end of South Park season 11, viewers were watching in suspense as an epic trilogy unfolded-that trilogy was Imaginationland. Starting off with Cartman and Kyle's bet involving Kyle gently sucking on Cartman's pubicle sack and culminating in a battle worth of Two Towers, it's just as awesome as it was months ago.

The ""feature"" (it's called a feature, but it's blatantly obvious it's still three episodes) begins with Cartman betting Kyle that leprachauns do exist, and if they do, Kyle has to finally suck Cartman's balls. Against all odds, the boys spy a leprachaun, who warns them of an ominous terrorist attack. The next day at school a strangely dressed man approaches the boys, and tells them to come with him on his balloon to Imaginationland. It seems the leprachaun was right, as Imaginationland is quickly attacked by terrorists. The US government works to stop the terrorists, while Cartman works at getting Kyle to honor his ball-sucking bet. The two stories intertwine, and thus the epic trilogy is born.

In recent years, South Park had begun to be less about comedy, and more about on-the-ball social and cultural commentary. Where earlier seasons featured a few episodes of true meaning mixed in among ones purely for entertainment, since about season 7 or so, things began to shift. Imaginationland goes right back to the classic South Park formula, as there's really nothing in terms of social lessons and satire outside of their classic pop-culture pokes.

From making fun of Michael Bay to poking fun at Jesus, Trey and Matt (and special guest writer Brad Neely, best known for Wizard People, Dear Reader; The Professor Brothers; and the George Washington Rap) are on top of their game.

If you're a fan of South Park or grew up on 80s and 90s cartoons and comics, Imaginationland has it all. You'll spend lots of time pausing the DVD on the scenes filled with characters in Imaginationland, trying to figure out who you spy. (That also makes a great party game if you can find a way to make it more entertaining, I suspect.) While there are some slow periods-and some outright awkward ones where Cartman pulls a Stewie Griffin and comes off as extremely gay-in the end the arc is an entirely joyous watch, and one that any fan of South Park-past or present-will enjoy thoroughly.

As a standalone DVD, it's a little hard to justify purchase for diehard fans, as you'll probably pick up the season once it's available in stores. It's a great buy for casual likers of South Park as it provides five brilliant episodes on one disc, but if you're a fanatic like me, I'd recommend just waiting for the entire season rather than buying the same things twice.

CONTENT - 4.5/5

Three of the more memorable South Park's in recent memory, and the three greatest-period--in terms of pop-culture references. You'll be singing ""Imaginayyyyy-tion!"" for days and days, pissing your neighbors off so much that they may wish for an actual terrorist attack on Imaginationland. If you've ever seen a South Park and thought ""That was funny!"" you'll love this.

VIDEO - 4/5

It's a DVD release of a TV show, so there's nothing too remarkable here. A few lines here and there, but nothing too noticeable. All of the cameos are one of the highlights, so keep an eye out for that off-color Optimus Prime, or that guy that looks suspiciously like Mario.

AUDIO - 3/5

It's uncensored, meaning no bleeping. Much like with other South Parks, though, the uncensoring takes away from a lot of the humor. It's just not as funny when Cartman goes on a rant without the constant bleeping obscuring every other word. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer my South Park censored; it's part of the charm and humor.

EXTRAS - 4/5

The audio commentary from Matt and Trey on here is by far the most I've ever heard them do for any episodes; we're talking about 50 minutes of commentary. They talk about inspirations for the arc to what made them do it to just general observations as we watch, and it's got their usual Matt and Trey wit. In addition, the DVD also comes packaged with the Woodland Critters Christmas episode and Manbearpig. The two play a central role in the story, so that's for those of you who might not have seen them the first time around. It's only two episodes, but they're two of the best.

REPLAY - 5/5

I've watched this at least five times now. You always notice something new, and like every good episode of South Park, the humor stands up to multiple viewings quite well.

OVERALL - 4/5

Imaginationland is easily the greatest thing to come out of Matt and Trey's mind in years, and the DVD shows that. If there's one downside to the entire thing, it's that if you're going to buy season 11 anyway, it almost seems like a waste of money to get it. For casual watchers and friends who don't want to own every episode on DVD, Imaginationland is a must-buy. For the regular viewers, rent it to check it out as a feature, listen to the commentary, then just grab season 11.",1249689600,,4986,4.68649885583524

3282463,5,B00105308I,"In its DVD form it's presented as a feature length movie but within season 11 it's simply 3 epic South Park episodes. The story begins with Cartman trying to prove to Kyle that he saw a leprechaun, and he made a bet that if he can prove they exist Kyle has to suck Cartmans balls. After setting a number of traps Cartman does manage to catch his leprechaun and prove to Kyle their existence, but it's at a cost and that cost is our imagination. The Leprechaun that they caught was on his way to warn the Imaginationland residents about a planned terrorist attack on our imagination. The gang are picked up by an eccentric character who takes them to imaginationland; after a wonderful and annoying song which is the key to our Imagination, the boys are taken into this world with all characters ever created by our imagination including Popeye, Luke Skywalker & Jesus.

In my opinion these episodes were easily the best that South Park has to offer and they gave us some of the more witty one liners that we've ever heard from South Park. The imagery is brilliant as the imaginary characters have you roaring with laughter with the situations that they find themselves in. A Care Bear being shot in the head and decapitated & Jason from the Friday the 13th movies saying he wouldn't want to meet the guy who thought of the woodland critters (Cartman)

These were truly a hysterical set of episodes and I would have loved to have seen them put this on the big screen as a genuine sequel to their first movie.

Needless to say, I'm a big fan.  When the Imaginationland trilogy first aired, I thought to myself, ""wow, they could easily just combine it all into a movie and sell it on DVD, I'd buy it"".  My thinking was on par with Matt Stone and Trey Parker, because sure enough a month or two later I saw the ad for the Imaginationland DVD, and bought it instantly. This movie has all the great elements of a South Park episode: Cartman going out of his way to get what he wants (Kyle as always being the culprit), countless allusions to current events (which is why the show has been so successful for so long), and of course any character you can think of that's ever been created as part of Imaginationland.  The Woodland critters are back, which is incredible.  To keep this short, if you like South Park, buy this...if you saw even one episode on the trilogy, buy this, if you've never heard of South Park, buy this..it's that good.",1208304000,2,1087,4.361386138613861
3282465,3,B00105308I,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone reportedly became fascinated with the narrative arcs of shows like ""24"" and ""Lost"" and, so, with ""Imaginationland,"" attempted to create three connected episodes of ""South Park."" It works better than it sounds.

The South Park kids discovered a land where imaginary creatures intermingle  -- survey the landscape and you'll see the Peanuts gang, Strawberry Shortcake, Snarf from Thundercats, Tron warriors among countless others, all bouncing around happily. No sooner have they arrived than terrorists attack and open the floodgates for the darker, more violent characters.

Meanwhile, the B-plot involves Kyle losing a bet with Cartman and, to fulfill the wager, he's required to perform an act that probably won't pass amazon standards (it rhymes with ""fleabag"" but the boys use far more direct terms).

Parker and Stone jump through all the storytelling hoops, ably ape and satirize ""24,"" present a valid though somewhat on-the-nose argument (""the terrorists have hijacked our imagination""), pull off one hilarious ""Saving Private Ryan"" gag and deliver some of the meanest fuzzy critters ever captured on film. What they do to Raggedy Ann is ... unspeakable ... and extremely funny.

I'm not a huge South Park fan -- I usually enjoy it but don't really go out of my way to see it -- but this was a solid, inventive, beautifully brutal trilogy of comedy.

But my favorite part of the disk is the commentary with Stone and Parker, which describes (in their chatty, profane, occasionally censored style) how they pulled the story threads together on deadline, how they dodged legal issues and -- after eviscerating him post-""Passion"" -- tell us that they really do kind of like Mel Gibson and think ""Apocalypto"" is better than all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, save ""The Sixth Sense.""

They're right. And they're funny. And it's highly listenable. But this may be the first commentary I've ever heard where the commentators simply get tired of talking and turn off the microphone ten minutes before the story ends. Which is, of course, kind of funny, too.",1208217600,3,2084,5.093841642228739

This DVD is a perfect example of what happens when original, creative, inventive people start to run out of ideas. I was disappointed in the first episode, puzzled why they made a second episode out of it, and amazed that they stretched it to three. This is not good work.

There are still good ideas and inspired moments to be found on South Park, but they're becoming fewer and farther between as time goes on. Parker and Stone are far more original and creative than I'll ever be and I think their work has been wonderful for many years; as evidence I have a nice collection of South Park on my shelf. But it's hard to excel forever, faced with the need to be fresh and inventive every single week. They've been so good for so long that I hate to see them go out with a whimper.

3282467,5,B00105308I,"SOUTH PARK has only been seen on the big screen once.  Despite topically relevant humor and episodes that are large in scope, the series rarely even does two-part shows.  In October 2007, the series gave fans the closest thing they are probably ever going to get to another SOUTH PARK movie with the three-part series originally titles as ""Kyle Sucks Cartman's Balls"" but is now being marketed as the ""Imaginationland"" trilogy.

This three-part series begins with Cartman and most of the rest of the crew hunting in the forest for a leprechaun.  Cartman swears he saw a leprechaun and vows to catch it. Kyle doesn't believe him and signed a note that if a leprechaun actually existed, he would suck Cartman's balls.  Sure enough a leprechaun is spotted and Cartman's crew attempts to capture it.  However, leprechauns have magic powers and it escapes. It tells the boys that it was on a mission to warn them about a terrorist attack.  Well, one thing lead to another and Stan, Kyle, Butters, Kenny, and Jimmy find themselves on a floating balloon with a strange man who takes them to Imaginationland.  The boys are asked what the leprechaun told them, but just as they are about to speak, Imaginationland is attack by terrorists.  The boys escape on a talking dragon, but Butters is left behind.  They waken in the morning and when talking to each other realize they all had the same dream. Not only that, but Butters is missing.  It's then that the boys realize that it couldn't have all just been a dream and that terrorists have actually attacked our imagination. What follows is an epic tale as the terrorist blow apart the wall that separates the good part of Imaginationland from the bad part.  A massive war begins, the government captures Stan and Kyle to find out why Butters was talking about them, and Cartman sues to force Kyle to suck his balls.

The story is massive in scope and one of the more entertaining things to do is watch the scenes that take place in Imaginationland and try to spot the different characters.  South Park does a lot of parodies and is often satirical so the show can get away with a lot more than many others.  The show includes characters from television, films, comic books, and even advertising.  I did notice that there were no Disney characters, Warner Brothers (such as Bugs Bunny), DC (Superman, Batman, etc.) or Marvel (X-Men, Spider-man, etc.) that I could see.  I guess even Matt Stone and Trey Parker have certain legal boundaries that even they can't cross. Overall, the Imaginationland story-arc is one of the best SOUTH PARK episodes in the past three seasons.

The DVD includes a commentary with Matt and Trey.  If you have any of the recent season releases of SOUTH PARK or the special episode DVDs, you're familiar with the mini-commentaries that the duo usually provides.  With most episodes they talk for 3-8 minutes and that's it.  On SOUTH PARK IMAGINATIONLAND the duo talks for almost forty minutes.  The DVD also includes a few storyboards as well as two extra episodes ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" from season eight and ""Manbearpig"" from season ten.  In the Imaginationland story, the Woodland Critters return to torture creatures in Imaginationland and Manbearpig escapes through a portal into the ""real"" world, causing Al Gore to go hysterical.

Overall, if you're a casual fan of SOUTH PARK or if you really, really, really liked the story arc, you may want to pick up IMAGINATIONLAND. If not, I'd wait until the Season 11 SOUTH PARK DVD set is released.",1207440000,8,3521,4.800995024875622
3282468,4,B00105308I,"Despite the fact that South Park has maintained a level of consistency in its humor for years (as opposed to Simpsons and Family Guy which confuses pedestrian humor and shock value without comedy or wit, respectively), I haven't really watched the show in their original broadcasts with my lack of Comedy Central on my TV. I'd usually just watch an episode whenever it was on or if I got into a ""mood"" for the show so upon seeing this at the store, I thought I'd give it a shot. While this isn't exactly South Park the movie 2, the scope, animation and length is certainly ambitious and it's just as hilarious and even satirical as the show's best episodes.

Cartman has started a bet with Kyle: if he can prove leprechauns exist, Kyle has to suck Cartman's balls, if not, Kyle gets 10$. Well much to their surprise, a leprechaun does show up only to warn them of an impending terrorist attack. The group, sans Cartman, is whisked away to Imaginationland where magical and popular characters reside. But the attack happens and everyone but Butters escapes so they have to save Imaginationland from the US Government while Kyle tries to avoid giving in on his bet to suck Cartman's balls.

A lot of what made South Park's humor work so well was getting you to laugh at things you wouldn't normally laugh at yet still maintain a sense of irony or satire that made it go beyond a simple joke. So a line like ""the terrorists are attacking our imagination"" works simply as a good line but also noting the US's tendency to have anti-terrorism/pro-America statements everywhere they could. Then of course there's my favorite line: ""wow, that is incredible, and totally ****ed up at the same time"" which can also describe the show's humor oddly enough. From references to films like Saving Private Ryan, the Abyss, as well as familiar film and TV characters, there's a lot to the episodes that makes it fun.

Bear in mind though there's a reason the show is so controversial and thanks to this DVD, it's as gory and profanity-laced as Bigger, Longer and Uncut was though there's not as much toe-tapping songs, just one...""unimaginative"" one. As far as extras you get the episodes ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" and ""Manbearpig"" which get featured in the main film, as well as a longer-than-usual commentary (not full length, sadly) with the creators.
