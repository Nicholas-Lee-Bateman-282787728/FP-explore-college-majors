8695258,1,B00REL1F6Q,I was expecting a DVD not a CD with PDF files.  I was very upset over this.  Nothing in the online description told me it was PDF files or I would not have purchased it.,1479168000,3,169,3.8

8695260,3,B00REL1F6Q,"This is a computer disk with pdf files, not a video dvd.  It states so on the description and on the back cover.  Shame on us for not reading carefully.  The information is ok but if we wanted to read we would have purchased a book.",1468627200,2,232,4.0

8695262,1,B00REL1F6Q,Total crap. This is nothing but pdf's of a book on a DVD. I was looking for an instructional DVD. Shame on me for not reading the description better before I ordered.,1438128000,2,166,4.21875
8695263,5,B00REL1F6Q,Very good directions. Simple and easy to follow! Can't wait for summer to do some more canning ! Good value and good information !,1422316800,,130,4.458333333333333
8695264,5,B00REL1F6Q,"I was looking for something just like this!  There are tons of old and new files, documents, and manuscripts out there on home canning and preserving food that it is overwhelming to look through it all and weed out the good from the bad.  Thankfully this data dvd did the bulk of the work for me and compiled it all in one location.  I really love the wealth of information that is stored on this dvd.  AS a newbie to preserving food, I was concerned about the cost to get started as well as the complexity of the process.  The information contained in these files is informative, easy to read, easy to follow, and set up to get you started right away.  I am so glad I found this!",1421712000,,680,4.232558139534884
