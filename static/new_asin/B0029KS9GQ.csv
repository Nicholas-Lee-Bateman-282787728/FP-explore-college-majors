Personally, I'm a sucker for any and all shows with nerdy characters involved, so when I read about this show's premise I figured it was worth a shot. I watched all 12 episodes and what do you know, it was a pretty fun ride. Before you start to make judgements about the brevity of the series, just realize that this series isn't really supposed to be a grandiose journey with incredible twists and turns... it's just a fun ride that lets you rekindle your faith in love and friendship (as corny as that sounds).

The premise is simple: Narue (pronounced Narr-oo-ae) is a young girl who is, incidentally, half-alien. Her alien father was sent to investigate our planet many years ago and married a human woman. I don't want to really spoil anything, but the reasons behind their coming together weren't exactly under the best of circumstances. From time to time, the Galaxy Federation checks in on Narue and her father to make sure they aren't revealing any confidential information to mankind.

The second biggest character is Kazuto, or ""Kazu"", as Narue refers to him. As an otaku (anime-lover, for those uninclined to such terms), Kazu isn't exactly the most impressive, striking guy in middle school. He's caring and sensitive, so naturally, he falls for the mysterious pretty girl named Narue. The two begin to go out together, and Kazuto learns he's not just dating any girl; he's dating a half-alien hybrid!

Other characters show up, like Yagi, the alien-obsessed purple-haired girl; Maruo, the bald-headed, flamboyant pal of Kazuto; and Kanaka, the older-yet-younger sister of Narue (it's a bit complicated; I understood it instantly, since I have read about it, but some people might not get it at first). Some other minor characters appear, but they don't really have much of an effect on the series overall.

In terms of plots, it's all really basic stuff. A few dating episodes, a beach and a pool episode, and a few episodes involving androids. In a way, you could argue that it's a weak point, but sometimes you just want a plain and simple story to follow. Narue and Kazuto are great together, and all the other members of the cast offer some pretty funny moments to keep you from drowning in the romance. As for how the alien stuff is incorporated, it's rather shoddy. I will admit, I enjoy watching this anime, but some things are just total PIS (plot-induced stupidity). The Galaxy Federation supposedly is a rather grandiose organization, but for the most part they just end up sitting on the sidelines telling Narue and Kanaka not to spill any information. Two times in the story, ""space ninja"" show up, but we never find out what they even want with Narue and her father. And I won't even begin to tell you how weird it is that the alien race Kanaka and her father are of are nearly IDENTICAL to normal humans. Ignoring it is probably your best bet.

Sadly, the story ends abruptly with Kazuto saying that he'll never leave Narue just because of the danger it presents. As a result, the really heartwarming love story of two middle school students is kind of left to your imagination.

I highly recommend this show, because even without a lot of intricate plots or groundbreaking new ideas, it works. The characters are fun, loveable, and bring their own unique personalities to the table. I am in no way an anime know-it-all, so I can only speak for the English dub. If you're into the original Japanese audio and the unaltered subtitles, you'll have to consult a different review.

Just for your information, there are actually a good number of special features included on the two discs, much more than what I was expecting to get out of a two-disc anime set from a show that didn't get enough backing to make it past twelve episodes. It's a shame, really, because after watching the things Narue and Kazuto go through, you really want to see more.

I highly recommend this!",1398297600,,3955,4.736918604651163

8357911,5,B0029KS9GQ,"The World of Narue has an alien girl trying to fit Earth society.  The trouble is that the story really does not focus that much on the alien part, allowing Narue to truly overcome all barriers with ease.  Well, they had to move fast with only 12 episodes.  That, and maybe a tad too much fan services, is the only real complains I can say about the anime.
The artwork is great, the development of the characters is touching and brings real warmth to the events, and they have cute combat scenes.  Well, they do.  Combat bunny girl robots!
The story touches on everything from the first date, cosplay, bikinis, the science behind traveling at light speed.  you name it!  A real gem.
I don't think I know any of the voice actors, which is good but sad.  Good because now I have more people to look up and see what other work they have done.  Sad because many people, not knowing them, may not end up picking up this series.",1279670400,2,922,4.345029239766082
