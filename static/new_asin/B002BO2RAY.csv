3895146,5,B002BO2RAY,"Great DVR.  Saw him live at Mt. Pleasant casino several years ago & this rivaled his performance there.  His songs are deep, personal, and touch just the right feeling button.  He really relates to his audience, live or on DVD.  Love Chris Isaak!",1269648000,4,246,4.651162790697675
3895147,5,B002BO2RAY,"After recently seeing Chris Isaak live, I was looking for a DVD. This performance is excellent, since it is a television show, the picture and sound quality is top notch. Chris and most of the band have been together over twenty years, their interaction is fun to watch and they know how to put on a show. I would like to see a DVD of a complete live show, as this was only a one hour TV show. This is a show I will be watching again and again.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Chris-Isaak/dp/B000F8OIAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Chris Isaak</a>",1266019200,,598,5.3052631578947365
3895148,5,B002BO2RAY,"I go see Chris Isaak every time he comes to town (twice if he's playing both local venues).  He is an amazing and very entertaining performer.  This DVD is just like the real thing... nothing beats seeing him live and his meet-an-greets afterwards, of course, but this DVD is just as good and entertaining as his live concerts because it actually IS a live concert.

The camera angles and quality allow you to experience the performance the way it was meant to be seen and heard.  The quality of the video & sound recording is excellent.

I highly recommend this one if you are looking for a great live DVD!",1255737600,2,607,4.4818181818181815
3895149,3,B002BO2RAY,"I like Chris -- I've seen him a number of times, first time in a dump South of Market in San Francisco about twenty-two years ago, and most recently about a month ago.  I own plenty of his music.  My negative comments aren't about the performer, but the production.

This show feels flat and contrived to me, and it looks to me like Chris feels the same way.  It's sanitized and homogenized, ""made for TV"", and it lacks the loose, humourous punch that I've always found at his live shows.  Pity.  It's just ... flat.",1253577600,16,516,4.378947368421053
3895150,4,B002BO2RAY,Better then the 2005 Soundstage. Most of the tracks covered in 2005 are on this DVD as well. I wish I'd have saved my money and bought this one instead of the 2005 Soundstage.,1252713600,2,175,4.176470588235294
3895151,4,B002BO2RAY,"I am a long time fan of Chris, and have been very excited for this DVD to be released.  The last Soundstage DVD left me a bit flat.  Having seen him many times in concert, this one was much more vibrant and fun.  He did his acoustic set, which I really love.  I had never heard him sing Western Stars live before, it was really beautiful.  My only complaint is with Soundstage.  The filming itself jumped around way too much,  I would have liked to have some wider shots of the whole band, but it it was just bouncing from shot to shot, some sideways, some at an up angle,  and never left you there long enough to really appreciate what each musician was doing.  Plus it made me a little nauseous.

And the way the bonus tracks are formatted is seriously messed up.  From the main menu,  you don't have the option to see all the footage they had cut.  You have to choose each song separately, which seriously messes up the flow.  I'm happy to see them, but they could have just put them all together.

But Chris was perfect.  From his sequins to his pretty voice.  He loves what he does, and he sure is good at it.

8361664,5,B002BO2RAY,"I have not had the opportunity to see Chris and his band live yet, but this DVD gave me a great preview.  I have watched many videos of Chris and his band and his interviews, not only does he have a beautiful voice, but his personality makes the performance even better.  The rapport between him and his band makes it more enjoyable. What a talented group of singers and musicians.  It proves that you do not need to have a large number of band members to give an excellent performance.  The quality of the video and audio was good on the first show, but was better on the second show. This purchase was worth every penny.  Until I can attend one his live performances,this DVD will be my concert.",1326067200,,697,4.372093023255814
8361665,4,B002BO2RAY,"If you want to watch Chris Isaak, and want to watch Chris Isaak and his latest girlfriend, and Chris Isaak and the sky, and Chris Isaak and the beach, and Chris Isaak and the ocean, and Chris Isaak's mouth in close up, and Chris Isaak's eyes in close up, and Chris Isaak's face in close up, and Chris Isaak with guitar in hand, and Chris Isaak's hair, .... , then this is for you.

If you want to watch the band play and perform, WAS THERE A BAND,  or was it all Chris Isaak.

The music is wonderful.
The music quality is exquisite.
The video quality is excellent.

But I had hoped to watch the band perform.  Very little of that.

Just Chris, and Chris and Chris and Chris and Chris and Chris and Chris ... , with this girl friend and that girl friend, and Chris Chris Chris Chris ...",1294963200,3,785,4.1655629139072845
