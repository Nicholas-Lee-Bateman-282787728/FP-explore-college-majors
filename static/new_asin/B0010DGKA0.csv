8237652,3,B0010DGKA0,So far my son has not shown much interest in this video. He is drawn to other learning videos we have.,1404777600,,102,3.9047619047619047
8237653,5,B0010DGKA0,"My toddler absolutely loves all of the Brainy Baby IQ DVD series. Although there are not any words being spoken, the classical music and high quality images are great. The Baby IQ series encourages my toddler son to talk more. He says a lot of words when he's watching like colors, numbers, shapes, or just plain words. I also talk about on screen images when watching the DVD too. The DVDs encourages curiosity from my son and he's constantly asking ""What is that?"" while watching. Often times he's giggling and pointing to the TV while entranced with this DVD. This is such a great educational buy and I wish that I'd found it during his infancy. Excellent buy and I highly recommend this to those who have babies and toddlers!",1358121600,,729,4.615384615384615
8237654,5,B0010DGKA0,"This is a very good DVD for my toddler son.  A little different than the typical Brainy Baby DVDs but worth it.  I would say that this DVD is more along the lines of Baby Einstein DVDs (with classical music, some puppetry) but better in my opinion.  It has counting, animals, colors, seasons, shapes, and patterns as topics.  This is a very engaging DVD for my 19 month old son who enjoys watching and repeating what he can..and me teaching him also!  Love it!",1355184000,2,460,4.428571428571429
8237655,5,B0010DGKA0,"My 4 and 1/2 month old daughter, has become completely captivated by these DVDs. She has been listening to classical music for some time now. We even purchased the belly audio system, when she was in the womb. Over the past weeks, she does not wake up crying. It took about 2 or 3 weeks of rotation, now she is hooked, while rocking in her Zen swing or jumperoo. We rotate between calling out the colors, animals,numbers [in swahili and english], but it seems she much calmer now and is just taking it all in.",1311724800,2,509,4.368421052631579
8237656,4,B0010DGKA0,"My child  responds well to the music only DVD.  The characters keep her engaged as well as educate her.  This is a DVD to watch with your child as you have to verbalize the topics (colors, movement.etc.).",1294963200,,204,4.45945945945946
