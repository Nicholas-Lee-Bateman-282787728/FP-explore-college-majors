8290389,1,B001CXYKHS,"Went to Vista House at Crown Point and saw this DVD, no preview of content was available. I thought it would give a tour of the Columbia River Gorge. Not so. There is very little about the Columbia River Gorge and way too much about the communities that line the Gorge. It is basically a chamber of commerce video to promote those communities.

I had bought it to send to my sister. I am always telling her about how beautiful the Gorge is and thought this would be a good way of showing it to her. Fortunately, I previewed it before sending it to her. Now it will just be dropped off at a thrift shop for resale. Didn't even finish it.",1377129600,,636,4.213114754098361
8290390,5,B001CXYKHS,"I am a native Oregonian who lives in Pennsylvania.  I go out to Oregon in the summer, and this year, I spent time at the Columbia River Gorge.  I wish I had had this video before my last trip.  It gives a great overview of the culture in each small community along the river, and this is not only a good guide for somebody thinking of relocating, but for any tourist, interested in seeing specific parts of the Gorge, and understanding the differences among the communities.  No, it is not too long.  It is very comprehensive.  As tourists, we have only so much time to spend on holiday.  This is an excellent guide so that you can make an educated decision as to where you want to visit, before the trip.  This is a much better travel guide than anything in print, and if you can find a copy, get it!  Kudos to the film-maker!!!!",1376092800,,830,4.303225806451613
8290391,2,B001CXYKHS,"I was looking for a video that would give a good view of the Gorge.
In the beginning of the video there is a cool time lasps section of one area, which was very innovative.  The remainder of the video is for those who are looking to move to the area.
They go over everthing from schools to employment even the boring old family stuff.
I that it lasted too long for what the content.",1258934400,,382,4.093333333333334
