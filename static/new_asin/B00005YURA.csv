8165389,5,B00005YURA,"I attended the HB Studio for about a year.  I was very lucky to have Stephen Strimpell as my acting coach.  He was wonderful and gave me many useful suggestions after I performed my scenes.  It was Stephen who told me, ""you need to go out and audition, you'll get parts.  The way to become a real actor is to go out and ACT.""  He left my class to do a TV series called ""Mr. Terrific"" and his class was taken over by William Hickey (""Prizzi's Honor"" ""A Hatful of Rain""), but I didn't find him to be as helpful as Strimpbell.  I always used Uta Hagen's book, ""Respect For Acting"" as a ""bible"" throughout the years that I was in the theatre.

Stephen was correct -- I got parts and gained a lot of experience.  I even tried out for Dustin Hoffman's directing debut for Broadway, ""All Over Town"" starring Cleavon Little.  I didn't get the part because I was too young, too thin and too tall.  I wasn't hurt, really.  They were looking for someone short, bald and fat.  But, I was told that it was a ""great audition.""

I anxiously read the chapter on Auditions in ""Respect...""  right before I went to tryout and it helped me ""give a performance,"" as she suggested.

Even though I'm not acting now, I intend to purchase these Hagen sessions.",1110931200,,1235,4.331877729257642
