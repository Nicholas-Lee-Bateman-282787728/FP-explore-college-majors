3445666,4,B001A5ES7A,"I was going to hold out on buying these LSH DVDs until they release them in whole seasons... but then, with the disappointing early cancellation of the show after Season 2, I realized it might never happen. So I am glad I finally bought them... even though there are no extras, it is great to have these on DVD, commercial-free.

Legion of Super-Heroes Vol. 3 contains the final five episodes of the first season... which were pretty good, especially for longtime Legion fans. They are:
- ""The Substitutes"" (the Legion of Substitute Heroes makes it to the animated world!)
- ""Child's Play""
- ""Chain of Command"" (Cosmic Boy returns, hooray!  He was sorely missing, as one of the original 3)
- ""Sundown, Part 1""
- ""Sundown, Part 2"" (the fate of Ferro Lad, animated style)

Happy 50th Anniversary, LSH -- Long Live the Legion!",1222732800,9,823,4.701388888888889
3445667,1,B001A5ES7A,I'm not wasting my money. 4 episodes per volume is just annoying! I'll wait for them to release the entire season.,1222128000,5,114,4.476190476190476
8276088,5,B001A5ES7A,"I picked up the three volumes of Legion of Super-Heroes and frankly found the first two a bit mediocre.  The Legion is a great science fiction-super hero mash-up with tons of crazy ideas and 50 years of history.  But all too often the stories came down to Superboy punching robots.

But this disk redeemed it all!

One episode covers some Legion trademarks, membership tryouts with would-bes, wanna-bes, and won't-bes from across the galaxy and the Legion of Substute Heroes - rejected 2nd stringers still out to do the right thing!

Later episodes include a leader election (in the comics it was traditionally done by fans letters) and a retelling of the classic Fatal Five story.

Like many fans I'm irked this show never got a proper DVD release and that the 2nd season was never released at all.  But then episodes on this disk are really a lot of fun and great representation of what made the Legion a great comic.  I would say if you're on the fence this is the disk to start with.",1473120000,,987,4.568181818181818

8276094,5,B001A5ES7A,I enjoyed the art for this series. The humor and wit is very much like most anima but less serious than the old comic series. It was nice to see the same characters come to life.,1296172800,,178,3.9722222222222223
8276095,5,B001A5ES7A,"I got hooked on the Legion of Super Heroes at age 11. I wanted, and eventually got, all Adventure Comics where the Legion appeared. I memorized everything about them while reading them over and over. I was quite happy to see that a tv series was made about them and I watched every episode. What a disappointment when they were canceled. Now, if only I could get the second season of the two that were aired. WHERE IS IT, WB? How hard can it be to release a few cartoons?",1268524800,,471,4.2444444444444445
8276096,5,B001A5ES7A,"Unlike some of the other cartoon series that have been released, Legion of Super-Heroes comes full circle and has a real and imaginative ending.  It's sad to see such a cool cartoon end, but it ended the best way possible.",1252713600,,222,4.55
8276097,3,B001A5ES7A,"I loved watching these cartoons on Saturday mornings.  Unfortunately these DVD's vol. 1, 2, & 3 had very few episodes per DVD and I'm pretty sure I saw more episodes on TV.",1234656000,,172,4.375
