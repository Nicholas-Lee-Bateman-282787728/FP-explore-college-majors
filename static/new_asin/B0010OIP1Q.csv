8238087,5,B0010OIP1Q,"A PAIR of HALLMARK ENTERTAINMENT in 1 case. EXCELLENT! 2 family friendly, drama tales with suspense and mystery. Star performances from seasoned actors & actresses. Wholesome footage with nothing to shelter from the kids. Although there is danger, heartache and bad judgment in the beginning for some characters, right wins out in most instances. There are lessons to be learned as well as entertaining dialogue and footage to watch. Done in the Hallmark perfection way, and ""Thicker Than Water"" even has a Dove endorsement. this is a bargain, since two full-length features are included in separate DVDs inside the case.

THICKER THAN WATER is a young female lawyer who goes on a search for added information when she discovers at the closing of her father's estate that he had an earlier undisclosed marriage, not Natalie's (Melissa Gilbert-Little House) mother. Finding clues, leads her to another lady, Jess (Lindsay Wagner) who is in the process of trying to save a wild horse ranch in the memory of her mother (who appears to be the lady Natalie's father had been once married with). Saving horses, hearts, kids, relationships, and so much more becomes a tangle of plots worthy of being called powerful Hallmark drama. Horse lovers will adore this film.
THICKER THAN WATER runs for 87 minutes, unrated, but family fine.

ORDINARY MIRACLES is a tale of a female judge (Jaclyn Smith-Charlie's Angels & more) who ends up foster-caring for a wayward child , Sally (Lyndsy Fonseca-the Young and the Restless) of the court as a stop-gap situation till another, 6th in 5 years, foster family can be obtained. In the meantime the Judge's interest in the troubles of the child, who displays such ability and intelligence, leads her to look for clues to Sally's past. Information found is perhaps more than Judge Kay Woodbury bargains for. Again, it is a mystery, struggle, and yet a heartwarming dramatic ending for which Hallmark is noted. ORDINARY MIRACLES runs 85 min. with a bit of violence but good for all but the very, very young.

2 delightful films worth watching over and over. My wife and I have watched them each twice already. Morally top drawer good.",1269216000,2,2161,4.9476584022038566
