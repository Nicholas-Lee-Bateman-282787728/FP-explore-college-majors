2056476,1,B00022LICK,"This review applies only to the Good Times Video DVD and its VHS counterpart in the ""Happy Trails Theatre"" series. The rating applies to the DVD, not the movie itself.

OUT CALIFORNIA WAY (Republic Pictures, 1946) is a singing cowboy western starring Monte Hale in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans make a brief cameo appearance. It was filmed in TruColor, a primitive color process that today has a certain antique-looking charm. It is the first of 19 TruColor pictures that Roy and Dale appeared in. The film is preceded by the statement ""This vintage material has been preserved on DVD in its original form, using the best available elements."" That statement is false. The evidence is the transfer itself. Although the DVD is in TruColor and boasts one of Good Times Video's better transfers, the picture quality is dim, muddy, blurry, and appears to be sourced from a dirty, damaged and heavily-used 16mm dupe.

According to the cover art, the film runs 65 minutes. Another false statement. The AFI database and imdb list the correct length at 67 minutes. The actual length of the film on this DVD is 53 minutes, meaning 14 minutes are hacked out of the film, causing distracting jumps in sound and picture, and rendering the continuity senseless. Republic routinely cut their singing cowboy films to 53 minutes for sale to television in the mid-1950s, supplying the networks with hastily developed 16mm dupes shortened to fill an hour-long time slot that also had 7 minutes of commercials. Obviously, Good Times Video transferred the inferior television version to DVD and its VHS counterpart. Hardly ""preserved in its original form from the best available elements"" while clean, sharp 35mm elements remain carefully preserved in Republic Pictures' vaults. The fact that this was done with the approval and participation of the Roy Rogers Family Trust (his heirs) makes it all the more sad for the fans.

There is no option on the DVD menu to watch ""Happy Trails Theatre"" apart from the film. This nostalgic chat between Roy, Dale and Iron Eyes Cody, videotaped in the late 1980s starts automatically when you push ""play movie."" It is used to pad out the running time of the film and to give the misleading impression that Roy Rogers endorses the inferior transfer.

The entire ""Happy Trails Theatre"" series on Good Times Video consists of cut films and hideous transfers. The series is not up to professional standards. Roy Rogers deserves better, and so do his fans who shell out their hard-earned money. Nothing can destroy the enduring legacy of a star and a role model more effectively than disseminating a product that undermines the quality of his work and makes him look like a cheat.",1292284800,4,2695,4.916483516483517
2056477,5,B00022LICK,"Roy Rogers and Dale Evans make a brief cameo appearance in one scene, and sing a song. However, the star of this film is their friend, Monte Hale, who is is just as personable, and a good singer too. He runs into a little boy, Bobby Blake, and his horse that does tricks. The little boy wants to get his trick horse into the movies. Monte Hale is trying to get his first break too. There are bad-guys and the pretty girl, and some action. However, the appeal of this film is that it is different and charming with a creative script. Cameo appearances by other cowboys of the old pictures who team up to help their pal Monte.",1254614400,,624,4.2521008403361344

8020629,3,B00022LICK,"I found a new/sealed copy of this DVD at the local Goodwill store yesterday for $2.00 and was happy to buy it. And I was pretty happy watching Roy and Dale talking shop with Iron Eyes Cody before the film presentation, from ""Happy Trails Theatre"".

Then the film began and it was obvious despite the claim on the cover that this film is ""Digitally Restored"" that it's not. ""Transferred to digital format from an old color print"" would have been more accurate. The video image is grainy and the color is faded. Also the impression is that you are buying a Roy Rogers film, not a Monte Hale film that Roy made a brief appearance in. There's not even a picture of Monte Hale on the cover!

Despite that, it was great to see Monte Hale, Bobby Blake, and John Dehner, along with Roy and Dale and the other cowboy actors make token appearances in the film. Monte Hale presents a good cowboy image in the film, which is enjoyable from what we see.

The movie itself is good, from what I can make of it, but the film has been chopped to pieces and I think about 15-20 minutes of the actual movie is missing. There are a lot of quick cuts from one scene to another when something has happened in between that we never see!

Unfortunately, this looks to be the only film of Monte Hale's that is currently available on DVD. I hope someone comes along and puts out a few more, that are complete too. But it's hard to tell if that will ever happen because the market for B western films from 60 years ago is small.",1368921600,,1501,4.293286219081272
8020630,4,B00022LICK,Although Roy Rogers does not have top billing in this movie you must add it to your Roy Rogers collection to make it complete.  I have one hundred of Roy's one hundred & sixteen movie collection & it took awhile before I was able to find Out California Way to add it to my collection. Monte Hale does a good part in this movie & go on to be a top western movie star. There is a lot of action & the story plot is very good making it a good movie to watch plus Roy & Dale in Happy Trails Theater with a very interesting guest. I would give this a number 9 out of 10.,1298073600,,564,3.8205128205128207
