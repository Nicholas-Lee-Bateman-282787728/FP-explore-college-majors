1083804,2,6305810125,"One of the great ironies of this botched adaptation is that when it originally aired on TV, ""Cellular One"" was among the sponsors. Not to belittle the extraordinary talents of Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Azaria, but  the filmmakers really blew it. Using flashbacks to illustrate as Morrie  (Lemmon) talks about his childhood will seem pointless to anyone who has  seen the film ""Short Cuts""--in which Mr. Lemmon delivers an  entire terrific monologue without visual aids. Another problem is the whole  relationship subplot (not in the book), not to mention Mitch's  sportswriting ""adventures"". An interesting aspect of the book,  only briefly touched on here, is America's obsession with the O.J. trial,  which was in full swing at the time of the real Morrie's demise. I thought  the book was great. I read it in a single morning, and it made me change  the way I looked at some things. The movie only made me want to change the  channel. Too bad!",962064000,11,939,4.80625

For all you people who said it was boring, you must not have been watching the right movie. because this one is sad, sweet and it will put a smile on your face in some parts. or you don't know what its like to live with a disease that eats at you day by day. not knowing what function of your body you will lose next. well. i hope you guys have some kind of heart or maybe you should go find one because you apparently don't have one and can't find the one god gave you.",1440892800,,691,3.839160839160839

Many people prefer to not think about the end - but doing so is a great guide for living each season of life.

1084129,5,6305810125,I haven't watched this movie in a long time and was looking forward to seeing it again.  It's a very touching movie about a student reconnecting with an old teacher who has developed ALS.  He makes it  a point to go see Morrie every Tuesday.  Morrie teaches him quite a few life lessons  and enables him to change enough to convince his ex-girlfriend to give him another try.  They end up getting engaged by the end of the movie.

Although this true story is sad as it's about a dying man reminising and reviewing the meaning of his life by exploring the importance of friendship, family, love and support, it also has many amusing lines which shows there can be humour and dignity while facing your own mortality. This film is moving, touching, funny, humbling and sad but it is also very inspiring.

While each person with ALS goes through a similar process, how each deals with it and the affect is has on him/her varies greatly.

1084401,3,6305810125,"""Tuesdays With Morrie"" is a film about death and dying and what is important in life.  It is hard to watch as Morrie Schwartz (Jack Lemon) is dying of Lou Gehrig's Disease and slowly but surely loses use of his body.  His spirit is strong and he has decided to learn something from each moment left.  Mitch Albom (Hank Azaria)  sees his old professor on TV by chance.  He is giving an interview to Ted Kopple of ABC's Nightline.  Mitch is a busy man, but feels a tug to visit Morrie before he dies.  Despite his job as high powered sports reporter, Mitch decides to take a few hours and reconnect with his mentor.  Morrie is ecstatic that he came to see him, he reminded Mitch he promised to keep in touch but is just glad he came.

The meeting turns into a scheduled time to talk to Morrie on Tuesdays, and record his dying words.  His inspirational thoughts on life transform Mitch's view on what is important.

So, two stories emerge, 1) facing and understanding the steady progression of  disease and dying  and 2) how to savor every minute of life as if every day is your last day.  Mitch learns from Morrie all over again.  He learns not to be afraid of marriage, aging, family, touching and caring.  The human spirit is based on simple truths that all humans face in life.  Mitch might be a successful sports columnist and television  host, but he has lost how to enjoy life and who is important.

Morrie embraces each day and although he has become as dependent as a baby, he frames his final days as full of love and being taken care of like a small child.  The movie is bittersweet and has a thoughtful message.",1286064000,,1621,4.393939393939394

1084425,5,6305810125,"You may think that a movie about the death of a man with ALS is going to be hard going but Morrie is no ordinary man. Played to perfection by Jack Lemmon, poignantly in his last screen role, Morrie is a retired University professor who wants to use his death to teach others how to live. Reunited with his fast-living former student, Mitch Albom, we see how his words and aphorisms turn Mitch from a nice but career-driven guy into someone more rounded and at peace with himself. Since the film is based on a true story - Mitch and Morrie are both real - it gives an added import to Morrie's words. The movie works due to its subtlety and its refusal to play-down the devastating effects of ALS. It also doesn't put Morrie on a pedestal; he has his dark moments and this makes his words more convincing. To know that he battles the same demons that we all do makes him less like a guru and more human. Although the film does carry a lot of wisdom, it never tries to preach. Mitch finds the lessons difficult and provides the sort of questions we might all have when faced with such statements as `We must love one another or die'. Ultimately, you feel Morrie succeeded in his wish to make his death a lesson in living and we must thank Mitch Albrom and the makers of this film, for bringing his words to us all.",1268179200,,1311,4.290322580645161

Much younger than Mitch was at the time of the story, but I too have my own Morrie.  We all need a Morrie in our life.
Morrie is Mitch's college professor, by title.  In actuality, Morrie is Mitch's mentor, friend... and life.
One evening, by chance, Mitch sees his old ""Coach"" on TV.  He finds out that Morrie is dieing from Lou Gehrig's disease.  He then remembers his promise to Morrie to keep in touch.  Well, he decides to make good on that promise, 16 years later.  That was the start of the renewal of their relationship.
Mitch starts to visit Morrie every Tuesday.  In their time together Morrie starts to help Mitch live.  He discusses all the frightening things about life, including fear itself.  Morrie takes his ""Buddy"" and turns him into a man.

It shows us we need to slow down, enjoy the simple things in life and show people we love them on a regular basis, not just when it's convenient.

1084552,4,6305810125,"This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that.

I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry.

My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other. This scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film. Although it's the last time that Mitch ever sees Morrie alive, it's still very sweet and poignant. The ending is pretty sad, but it's also happy at the same time. Morrie is gone, yet his legacy lives on.

My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film. Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, ""Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie.""In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting. To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely. The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr. Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves. It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.

He did much to teach his former student about life, often quoting W.H. Auden's poem ""September 1st, 1939""

Mitch feels awful because he said he would keep in touch with Morrie after college, but never did. Mitch decides to keep his promise and to finally go see his dying teacher. Morrie recommends that the two start to see each other every tuesday. Mitch records their visits to get Morrie's view of things on tape. This is a very good movie. What makes this movie is that it's real. This is true. The two stars give incredible performances.

Hank Azaria is very good too. The end scene with the two was priceless. You need to see this. If you like these movies, then Morrie is for you. Very good.",1001721600,34,1052,4.513089005235602
1084631,5,6305810125,"I think this movie was superbly written and the actors did a fantistic job of telling this tragic story as it really is in true life. I lost my wife of 29 years to this horrible disease. At times it was extremly difficult to watch. Unlike Morrie, my wife gave up on life when she recieved her diagnosis on Nov 17 of last year. I was her only caregiver and I could relate to everything in this movie. The main difference was that my wife was unable to speak and her memory was going by the wayside. I would recommend this movie to everyone.",996278400,11,539,4.1923076923076925

1084633,5,6305810125,"I give this movie high marks - beautiful story (especially good because it is true), great cast, and a wonderful message.  I had read an excerpt of the book in Reader's Digest some months back, so I decided to watch the movie when it was replayed after Jack Lemmon's death.  I cried for two hours.  I think this movie affected me so deeply because I have watched my mother, who has a personality very similar to Morrie's, deteriorate much the same way due to multiple sclerosis.  While I don't relish crying, this movie was an enjoyable catharsis.",994118400,,547,4.608247422680412
