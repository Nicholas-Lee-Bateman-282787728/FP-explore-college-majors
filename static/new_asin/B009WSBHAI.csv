5370367,5,B009WSBHAI,"This is a fantastic, heart pumping 30 minute workout.  If you have ever wanted a group fitness class at home - this is the workout for you.  Brit has designed a full body workout that will burn tons of calories, increase your fitness level and tone your body from head to toe.

I highly recommend this video for all fitness levels - every level will be challenged and feel the burn.  Awesome addition to your fitness routine - can't wait for Brit to produce more videos!",1353283200,,470,4.430232558139535
5370368,5,B009WSBHAI,"Britt, you'll be so proud of me, i'm working out to your dvd!!! I want to thank you for inspiring me to stop making excuses and start exercising. It was so hard for me to include this as a part of my everyday living. Thank God you didn't give up on me and you kept pushing me. It's what i needed!!!  I'm over 50 and feeling fabulous but no where near being fine and fit...until now! Because of all your helpful workout plans, menu tips and encourageing words i'm looking and feeling so much better. Other people are noticing it too, yeah! Grit by Brit got me started and now i'm hooked!!! I also do Zumba 3 times a week and I'm loving it. The lbs are coming off and I'm finally starting to like the way i look again. Thanks Brit-Brit for helping me to be a happier/healthier me. Love you!!!",1353283200,,790,4.197368421052632
5370369,4,B009WSBHAI,I tried the video last week - I was really surprised to see how much I sweated in just 30 minutes.  Sign of a good workout for me! I liked the timer and the side menu to help me keep track of where I was in the workout / how much I had left to do. I think I'm going to use this as my go-to for the days I can't get to the gym. Highly recommend.,1353196800,,344,3.4675324675324677
5370370,5,B009WSBHAI,"I have attended Brit's classes at a gym and they are always packed. She brings so much energy to the classes at the gym so I was excited to learn about her fitness dvd.
The dvd is simple to learn the moves and also find your fitness level. With 3 different levels to workout on, you can sweat and tone at your own level without changing the dvds.

What I love about the dvd is the how Brit is working out in real time with you. She is sweating just as hard as I was during the dvd, which means I am really working out!

This is a great beginner dvd and I love the story behind it. It's very affordable and easy to do especially while traveling. Just pop in the dvd, press play and sweat. I enjoyed the dvd and also the site. She has a lot to offer and I am already ready to see the second volume.

Note: I was able to purchase mine before the public and test it. I have not been compensated financially for this post.",1352678400,,917,4.0
8544725,2,B009WSBHAI,"I am sort of disappointed in this DVD. I am not sure what I was expecting but I am sure it is not what I got. The basic quality of this DVD is substandard. The audio doesn't match up with the speaker. The graphics are poorly done, the room they workout in is tiny and the moves are VERY Fast and hard to keep up with. I am sure if I stuck with it I would be able to get it down, but the visual of the DVD is uninspiring and ugly to watch. I spend $25 on this and not happy. I have purchased many other workout DVDs that were much less expensive in the past and been much happier with those. All in all, I would not recommend this DVD.",1444089600,,634,3.8106060606060606
8544726,1,B009WSBHAI,I ordered this workout video thinking that it would be a great short workout for home.  I previewed it the other night and I just don't care for it.  I don't feel that the movements are accentuated and wouldn't be very beneficial to my body toning.,1395878400,,248,4.369565217391305
8544727,5,B009WSBHAI,"What a GREAT workout! I love the full body movements, ""agenda"" on the side, and the variety of levels Brit or her friends provide. The length of time and variety make it easy for me to use traveling (hotel room) or on busy workdays.",1394064000,,232,4.295454545454546
8544728,5,B009WSBHAI,"Wow, this was a great, tough workout! I had 5lb hand weights and had to set them down pretty quickly during the arms section. Think I need lighter weights (or to workout more!)

This video is high energy and fun. Brittani has a great energy and keeps you going, even through some intense cardio sections. Whoever invented burpees should probably be shot, but Brittani helped me get through two separate rounds of burpees.

My favorite part of the video came at the end - and not just because I was done working out! - Brittani reminds us to be thankful for our heart, lungs and healthy body. It put a smile of my face and made me happy that I pushed through til the end.",1358294400,,670,4.352
8544729,5,B009WSBHAI,I don't always have time for the gym between work and school. This was an intense 30 minute workout. It worked all my muscle groups and my core.  A great dvd to have on hand especially if you have a crazy schedule. Well worth the purchase.,1358294400,,239,4.195652173913044
8544730,5,B009WSBHAI,"This DVD is tough!  You get everything you need in 30 minutes - great for getting your workout in if you have little time to spare.  Brit's energy is amazing and you see everyone sweating so you know its working.  The pushups at the end are killer and so are the abs.  Great job, Brit!  Can't wait for Volume 2!",1353715200,2,311,4.116666666666666
8544731,5,B009WSBHAI,"I love the GRIT by Brit blog. So, I was delighted to hear about this DVD. And, the workout did not disappoint! Unlike some of the other workout DVDs I have tried, GRIT by Brit's is totally accessible for all fitness levels. I also loved Brit's upbeat tone and encouragement throughout the DVD. Lastly, I learned new moves that I had not tried before.

If you're looking to add more variety to your workout routine, definitely try this DVD. It's also great for anyone who travels or has a hectic schedule that makes fitting in set aerobic classes or gym time difficult.",1353456000,,568,4.568627450980392
8544732,5,B009WSBHAI,"I definitely recommend this video.  GRIT by Brit is a like a newer, younger, more athletic version of Turbo Jam. (I'm Turbo Jam fan btw)  I like that I can dance with moves and have fun but also do some intensity drills and feel super strong.  This is a great pick to get you through the holidays!",1353456000,3,297,4.175438596491228
8544733,5,B009WSBHAI,"I'm an avid gym rat and enjoy working out. But my work schedule has included a lot of traveling lately so I've been missing a lot of my regular workouts. I carry the GRIT DVD with me whenever I travel. Pop in my computer and burn the calories for 30mins each morning when I'm traveling. The workout is challenging for all levels and gives you a full body workout in 30mins! I love it, definitely on my gift giving list.",1353369600,,419,4.25
8544734,5,B009WSBHAI,If you are just beginning or an advanced pro you will love the fast paced kickboxing DVD.  There are all levels of members on her team so you can relate to high intensity or just getting that burn! It is a lot of fun and Brit has such great energy.  You will love the leg portion and the abs at the end. Try something new and get your grit on!,1353283200,,343,3.8857142857142857
