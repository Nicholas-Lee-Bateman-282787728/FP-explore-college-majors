5734876,4,B00CQ9JYIC,"not really a movie, more of a documentary about winemaking in Argentina. Interesting for someone in the wine business.",1438819200,,118,5.2631578947368425
5734877,5,B00CQ9JYIC,"Funny how a grape named for it's utterly awful word-of-mouth reputation (Mal-bec = ""Bad-Mouthed"") has developed into a go-to varietal that ranges from easy everyday drinking to the most special occasions, with a masterful Argentine offering in each class.  We've cellared about forty or fifty different Malbecs over the years and each one has been a delight in its class.",1438387200,2,371,5.183333333333334
5734878,4,B00CQ9JYIC,interesting and enjoyable to watch.  Gives the history of Malbec and the various perspectives that people have of this wine.,1386720000,,124,5.2
5734879,5,B00CQ9JYIC,"Lovely wine documentary!!  An in-depth look at the personalities behind Argentina's wonderful Malbec wines.  Coming in at just over an hour in length, the film is well focused.  The cinematography quality is above and beyond any other wine documentary I've watched (and I've watched most all of them).",1381881600,,301,5.229166666666667
5734880,5,B00CQ9JYIC,"I saw this movie after purchasing the DVD in a wine shop. Wow, I had no idea of the rich history of Argentina's wine industry. Such beautiful scenery and such interesting subject matter. I watched the movie with my wife and a bottle of Malbec. Such a great thing to do on a cold evening when we didn't really feel like going out. The movie shows all the struggles Malbec producers go through, from dealing with tough economic conditions, weather and then the hard to please gate keepers in the USA that pressure the producer on price. I gained a new understanding of Argentina's rich land of Malbec. Highly recommended.",1381795200,4,619,4.636363636363637
5734881,4,B00CQ9JYIC,"Niche-area documentaries can be a tricky proposition for audiences.  Not only do the filmmakers rely on the audience's presumed interest (or ability to be interested) in a niche topic, but the film itself needs to be sufficiently entertaining or informative.  I came to BOOM VARIETAL, a film about the recent popularity of a red wine from Argentina, a mostly naive viewer: I don't know much about wine and even less about wine culture.  Perhaps then, it is a testament to filmmakers of BOOM VARIETAL that I found the movie interesting and fun.

BOOM VARIETAL follows the strange history of the Argentine Malbec, one of wine's underdog stories.  What is Malbec?  Malbec is a fruity red wine originally created in Europe.  After several years, someone discovered that the dry Argentinian climate would be an ideal environment for growing the grapes that are used in Malbec.  With the increased production and export of Argentine Malbec, the wine has become widely successful and popular internationally (particularly in North America).  BOOM VARIETAL follows the story of this wine's rise from it's early inception to today's popularity.  The movie makes use of a relatively wide variety of people involved with the wine: distributors, sellers, farmers, authors, consumers, store owners, and wine connoisseurs.  This technique gives the audience a broad overview of the wine's success, and it's quite fun to see how the success of Malbec has affected all of these people (most who are very enthusiastic about it).  I particularly enjoyed some of the interviews with the Argentinian farmers who have been working the land for years -- not only does it expand the scope of the film, but it provides a nice human element to an otherwise esoteric subject.

Clocking in at just over an hour long, BOOM VARIETAL feels just a little too brief.  I would have loved to see more footage about how Malbec is created, but alas, that's just not what this documentary is about.  Instead, it's about the success of the wine and its new place in food culture.  The dialog in BOOM VARIETAL is mostly English, but there are sections composed of mostly Spanish.  I bring this point up because the font of the subtitles are aesthetically pleasing -- plenty of movies go with a blocky font, but the filmmakers' attention to detail includes the typography of these Spanish subtitles.  The love of Argentine Malbec is clear throughout this movie, and it's interest is quite infection.  The film isn't a blatant advertisement of Malbec either, and some time is spent with Malbec naysayers who believe wine culture is in a bubble of sorts.

BOOM VARIETAL is a nice, brief snapshot of a wine that has found recent, international popularity.  The film is fun and playful; I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys Malbec wine these days.  However, if you are NOT a wine drinker at all, you might not get much out of this documentary.  But if you're like me and enjoy wine every now and then, there's enough universality here that you'll enjoy your time spent here.",1374796800,2,3048,4.921722113502935
