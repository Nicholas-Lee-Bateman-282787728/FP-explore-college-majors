Seem to have all or almost all of the same special features as the regular individual movie sets. Still is a great box set, who ever is in charge should continue making box sets for these movies. I know WB came out with the first 3 movies in an okay box set, then Miramax with these movies (4-7), I saw a crappy version that you can buy from places such as Wal-Mart and Target for about $5, doesn't compare to how awesome this box set is. Viz now should release at least 4 movie box sets or 3 movie box sets for the rest of the series since they own the rights now.
Now if only they would release Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions, Advanced Challenge, and Advanced Battle on dvd box sets!

So if you are a fan of the series, I recommend getting this box set.",1336953600,,859,4.206060606060606
