7425387,5,B0151SDLL0,"My grandfather was one of the many orphans who were placed. While he had been born in Geneva, NY in 1904, his parents later went to NYC where they relinquished my grandfather and his older half-sister to the Children's Aid Society in late 1908. His parents then returned home where they later divorced and remarried. So, it is incorrect to assume that all of these children were the children of newly-arrived immigrants and that they were all orphans. The documents state that the children were both quite sick and in fact, his sister died due to complications that developed after a tonsillectomy.

A few months later, my grandfather who had just turned five was taken to Iowa along with some other children by H.D. Clarke who kept up correspondence with him through the years. My grandfather was fortunate in that he was placed with a woman who really wanted a son rather than ""free help"". Though she was single and in her early 40's at the time, she had a good farm in central Iowa adjacent to the farms of her brother as well as her sister and brother-in-law. After the initial trial period, she adopted my grandfather.",1493164800,34,1123,4.671717171717172

7425390,4,B0151SDLL0,"Very good documentary regarding a little known event in history. My book club read a book regarding orphan trains which sparked my interest to learn more, as no one in the club had previously heard of it. Most information only shows the outcome in a positive light, and it was for many children. But for others it was an opportunity for abuse and rejection. This is an unbiased view of both sides.",1467676800,5,397,4.527777777777778

7425396,5,B0151SDLL0,"Excellent documentary with some fine re-enactments.  Filled with actual survivors testimony.  Keeps one alert for what happened to the girl, girls, and boys.  I think I would not have survived such treatment and loss of parents.  OUCH!",1447459200,5,235,5.27027027027027
7425397,5,B0151SDLL0,"It is easy in this day and age to view what happened with the orphan train as an atrocity.  However after viewing this documentary I've came to realize that taking the children west was clearly for their best interest and not cruel at all.  Yes, no doubt some had horrific stories but the fate awaiting them in New York was seldom better.  I watched this documentary with a lump in my throat yet with admiration for the work H.D,. Clarke did for so many children.",1525305600,3,463,4.423529411764706

7425400,5,B0151SDLL0,"Through many tears I gained so much about children who were given another opportunity to have a good life.  So sad that our government makes it so difficult for orphan children to be adopted these days.  My nephew and his wife are not able to have children of their own, but because of the expense, they are unable to provide a child with a loving home.  I thank God that He gave so many people the love and compassion to help the children in this documentation.",1524441600,,462,4.348837209302325

7425405,4,B0151SDLL0,"Wow.  Good documentary .  It shows the resilience of children and the corruption or meanness of some adults.  Children are gifts, no one is perfect.  I cannot fathom treating a child as if they were not the most valued member of my family, at any age.

UI hope to foster and adopt at least three children one-day, not babies, kids.  Every child deserves love so parts of this was hard to watch.",1523491200,,394,4.402777777777778

7425407,5,B0151SDLL0,"4/7/2018 - OMG, I used 4 Kleenex watching this.  It is a wonderful film, sharing the stories of these children who were shuffled off to strangers.  Very touching.  Through my tears, I was in awe at the courage of these orphans and especially Emily, the title orphan, and the way they just kept moving forward in life.  Not all of the train orphans ended up happily but neither do birth children.  Not a fancy film, but it is told by people who know what they are talking about and it had me riveted to my seat.",1523059200,,510,4.270833333333333
7425408,5,B0151SDLL0,Very heartbreaking to know that children went through this. Life is so fragile be thankful we live in a time with stricter rules,1522886400,,128,4.608695652173913
7425409,4,B0151SDLL0,"I thought that ""Annie"" and ""Oliver"" were exaggerated to be made into musicals. I learned from this and appreciate some of the changes USA made to protect children. We've come a long way and still have far to go.",1522627200,,211,4.435897435897436

7425413,5,B0151SDLL0,"This was an excellent documentary and tells the forgotten story of the ""Orphan Train"".  I didn't know anything about an ""Orphan Train"" until my next door neighbor told me that his father was one of these children.  Unfortunately, good records were not kept during this time so it is very difficult to get information on the children as most names were changed when they were sent to their new ""families"".  But it was an excellent documentary and sheds more light on this part of our history.",1522281600,2,491,4.686046511627907

8732272,4,B0151SDLL0,"I liked the historical significance of this short documentry, and the commentary from decendents of orphan train riders.  It is mind boggling that this is how children were corrallled on trains like cattle to be shipped off to strangers.  Separated from their siblings, and expected to forget their past so that they could start a new life is heartbreaking.  I wouldve liked to have seen how these children functioned as adults, but as they discussed in the movie, there were less than 100 living at the time of production.
