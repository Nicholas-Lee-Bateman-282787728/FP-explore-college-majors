8323761,5,6303553419,"While working for The Scientific Revolution at

The Universal City Walk many moons ago, I

must have watched all 5 of the Mind's Eye

Video line-ups at least a hundred times or

more, as it's music became as noticeable as the

individual beats of my own heart. Even as I

write this, I can not help smiling, as my

memories swell ripe with color craziness, set to

music that has been given it's freedom to

enhance the whole experience in any way it

can. It was a very special time for me,  when the

duties of my job description, for which I was

being paid ( and quite well as I remember it) to

enthusiastically as possible, demonstrate a

plethora of different scientific gizmos, and toys

that were cutting edge quantum physics

experiments, and principles that have been

shown to be relatively safe in the practiced

hands of a highly skilled professional lab-rat. I

think I am smarter years ago, because I made

sure every choice I made,  was directly

resulting in pure  FUN...ALL DAY....EVERYDAY,

especially while I was on the clock, at the job

of my dreams...playing with all the latest

grown-up toys.  But it was a fact that,  nothing

could bodyslam my obviously happy

demeanor, faster than when I notice that all my

youthful displays with my latest gadget that

was required of me to master and promote

during my shift in the ""Lab"" that particular day,

has gone completely un-recognized as the life

changing gizmo that it most certainly is.  That

is usually the time when THE Regional District

Supervisor for all The America's Discovery

Stores. Speaking I am, of The Top, Bottom, &

Central  America's, of course.  Quickly

realizing the gravity of this once in a lifetime

opportunity to demonstrate, why I love my job,

that is so well matched to my boyish

enthusiasm, augmented by my extensive

working knowledge of all things-- ""FUN"" ---

found anywhere within those 4 walls.  Soon I

would have droves of 'em comin' over to  ask

me if they could learn about & play with them

too. My efforts are not ignored,  and the

following week, I get promoted to Assistant

Manager.......YES!!!!! With a big fat raise, but it

comes at a severe price, because we all learn of

the Scientific Revolution's new Fate.......it is to

be ""absorbed"" by the ""Parent"" Company--The

Discovery Channel Store.  Doors close in 2

months, to my childhood dream job, and life as

I knew it will never be as fun again. As the

times they are a changin, With or. Without my

participation.  I'm positive however, that my

store would not have had the mind blowing

sales that I witnessed daily, while The Mind's

Eye Trilogy Box Set played everyday on those

flat screen TVs that were all part of my fond

collective memories of that time in my life.  All

these emotions, and walk down memory lane,

that I shared with you, is because I just found

in my spare room yesterday, an un-opened VHS

Box Set of 3 ""Mind's Eye"" video tapes in

perfect condition, on a closet shelf.  I just can't

wait for some special person or a nice family to

decide to buy it, and take the time to

experience this ""feel happy"" animated rarity in

this day and age. Enjoy this vintage video.....I

know I'll be remembering scenes from it for

decades to come, about some of the material

that's way over a decade old.",1388361600,,3308,4.595486111111111

To emotion inflicting music and thought provoking animation, both beautiful and amusing. McDonald's at Navy Pier in Chicago used to play the tape on multiple TV screens in the 90's and I asked them what it was and purchased it myself. It's a beautiful experience.",1050019200,,424,4.666666666666667
