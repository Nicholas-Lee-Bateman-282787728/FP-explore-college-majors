5322250,3,B009E7DVNS,"Let me preface my review by apologizing for lobbying for what I would like to see improved, more than critiqueing this release on its own merits.  This BD release of Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth really is welcome, particularly because it is the only one to date that plays on NTSC for the North American Region, whereas the German and Spanish BDs are PAL or Other Region and require alternate equipment to play in the US.

That said, I find the Mexican restored BD to have a crisp, clean picture quality.  Still I must quibble about the color saturation.  Perhaps nothing can be done about it, in which case the Mexican BD is as good as it can get.  It seems that all the DVD versions I've seem have a slightly blanched quality, i.e., lacking a deeper golden sunlit saturation even in scenes without a cloud in the sky.  It's as though someone made a negative from a negative.  However, if and when Lionsgate produces a US BD edition of the miniseries, I hope that they can do whatever they can to correct this.

Then there is the matter of content and/or length.  In 2009-2010, a 5 DVD Director's Edition of Zeffirelli's Gesu di Nazereth was released at 377 minutes.  It was in that release that the 2 scenes concerning Judas' betrayal were cut from the feature.  I can only speculate why, whether it was Zeffirelli's own decision or not, that, the European versions of the complete TV miniseries  exclude them, even though they are availalble and greatly facilitate the continuity of the action.  This Mexican blue ray edition was apparently made from the 377 minute European DVD version.  I don't know about the German and Spanish blue ray editions.

The problem is that the Mexican BD claims to be 382 minutes, as though it included the 2 scenes.  And, while the 5 DVD Director's Edition cut the 2 scenes from the feature, it did include them as ""Deleted Scenes"" elsewhere in the package.  The Mexican BD does not include them even as ""Deleted Scenes"".  Again, I sincerely hope that, when and if Lionsgate produces a US BD edition, they will do so using all the materials that constitute their 382 minute DVD, with the excluded scenes reintegrated into the feature.

One thing that I found interesting.  The Mexican BD divides the miniseries into 4 parts, each part prefaced by a trailer and titles, much the way it used to be presented in a TV airing over 4 consecutive nights.  Others may disagree, but I find that format both satisfying and nostalgic.  The 5 DVD Edition contains what appears to be the original British TV trailers as extras.  If and when Lionsgate produces a US BD edition, it would be a welcome surprise if they would divide the miniseries into 4 parts and use the original American (or British) TV trailers to frame the parts.  If they put the trailers on separate tracks, those who do not wish to see them can simply skip the track.

I would also like to see a Lionsgate US BD edition that uses the extras to be found in the 5 DVD Director's Edition.  Aside from the fact that the 5 DVD Edition is in PAL format, the Italian interviews have neither English dubbing nor English subtitles.  A US edition can make good on that.

Finally, I have to make one last pitch for someone to find the elusive deleted scene of Jesus' Temptation in the Wilderness.  It followed immediately upon the scene of Jesus' Baptism, and was not cut from the final edition until the last minute before broadcast.  Zeffirelli himself says as much in his book about the making of the Jesus miniseries.  And proof of that, if further proof were needed, is the fact that there are still photos from the scene included in William Barclay's book that accompanied the TV broadcast as well as on the cover of the Soundtrack recording.  I trust that Zeffirelli exercised good judgment in cutting the scene.  But I would, all the same like to view it as a ""Deleted Scene"" if it can be found.

So there is more to be hoped for should a US BD edition ever be produced. But meanwhule the Mexican BD has its merits.",1393200000,8,4007,4.565826330532213
5322251,5,B009E7DVNS,"YES, I AGREE WITH ALL HERE. IT IS WELL PAST TIME THAT THIS TITLE WAS PAID THE RESPECT IT IS DUE BY A PROPER FRAME BY FRAME RESTORATION INTO A HIGH QUALITY BLU RAY VERSION - WITH LOADS OF EXTRAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALTHOUGH OVERTLY OIRISH CATLIC IN NATURE; (MANY UNBIBLICAL SCENES, TOO MANY TO POINT OUT - AFTER ALL, THE MAN WYT' THE FUNNY HAT IN ROME DOESN'T GIVE HIS APPROVAL TO EVANGELICAL PRODUCTIONS, NOW DOES HE), THIS IS STILL A PRETTY SOLID DEPICTION OF THE LIFE OF JESUS, (THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF THE ONE TRUE LIVING GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC & JACOB; MESSIAH OF ISRAEL AND SAVIOUR OF WHOMSOEVER WILL BELIEVE).
THE ACTING IS PRETTY GOOD, (FOR A 70'S TV GIG); THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS QUITE DAZZLING IN PLACES; AND THE 6 PLUS HOURS IS ACTUALLY WARRANTED, GIVEN THE IMMENSE SCOPE OF THE NARRATIVE.
ALTHOUGH CAREFUL WHEN WATCHING HUMAN DEPICTIONS OF THE ANOINTED ONE; I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS ONE RANKS AS PERHAPS ONE OF THE VERY BEST SO FAR ACHIEVED; BOTH REVERENT AND VERY, VERY HUMAN IN ITS PORTRAYAL. AN ALL-STAR CAST THAT MOSTLY SHINE IS ALSO A HIGHLIGHT HERE.
THE REASON I REMAIN CAREFUL CONCERNING MOVIE PORTRAYALS IS BECAUSE THE BIBLE ACTUALLY COMMANDS US NOT TO MAKE PHYSICAL DEPICTIONS OF THE LORD; THE REASON SO MANY CATHOLIC DEPICTIONS ARE IN PRINT, (THE PASSION; THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST; KING OF KINGS; THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, ETC. ETC.); IS BECAUSE THE WRITERS OF THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM HAVE SEEN FIT TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE SECOND COMMANDMENT WHICH IS ALL ABOUT NOT MAKING GRAVEN IMAGES OF ANYTHING IN HEAVEN ETC.; AND SINCE JESUS IS NOW ACTUALLY IN HEAVEN STANDING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER IN INTERCESSION ON BEHALF OF BELIEVERS; THAT MEANS MAKING NO GRAVEN IMAGES OF HIM EITHER; WHETHER THEY ARE STATUES; STILLS, OR MOVING PICTURES; WE ARE WARNED AGAINST DOING SO.
SO HOW DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH COVER UP THIS REMOVAL OF THE 2ND COMMANDMENT AND STILL GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEIR FLOCK IS STILL FOLLOWING TEN INSTEAD OF NINE?
SIMPLE; KEEP THE 10 AS IS IN THEIR VERSION OF THE BIBLE AND CHOP UP THE LAST COMMANDMENT CONCERNING COVETING INTO TWO IN THE CATECHISM; NOW YOU HAVE `DO NOT COVET ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE' AND `DO NOT COVET ANOTHER MAN'S ASS, (DONKEY)'. WHERE THE BIBLE, (THE REAL BIBLE MAKES THESE TWO ACTUALLY ONE COMMANDMENT; THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM BREAKS THEM INTO TWO. AND SINCE WHEN ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT THE CATECHISM ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN SO INDOCTRINATED AS TO NOT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE 10TH COMMANDMENT, (ONE OF THE FEW THINGS GOD HIMSELF ACTUALLY WROTE WITH HIS OWN FINGER), BEING MESSED AROUND WITH; IT WON'T MUCH MATTER IF THEY LEAVE IT AS IS IN THEIR PER-VERSION OF THE BIBLE. (NOW WE CAN ALL BOW DOWN TO STATUES OF WHOEVER HAS A HALO ON THIS CENTURY AND GET AWAY WITH SELLING ALL THOSE GLOW IN THE DARK EVER-VIRGIN MARY'S TO PROMOTE SUPERSTITIONS GALORE AND STILL GIVE THE MASSES, (EXCUSE THE PUN), THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE CHRIST OF THE BIBLE INSTEAD OF THE MANY CHRISTS OF THEIR IMAGINATION; YOU KNOW, THE STAIN GLASS BRAD PIT LONG HAIRED EX-HIPPY LOOKALIKE WHO IS SOFT ON SIN, RATHER THAN THE ONE DESCRIBED BY ISAIAH AS BEING OF NO COMELY APPEARANCE THAT WE SHOULD DESIRE HIM...)
ANY-WHO...
ALL THAT ASIDE; I STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE AND DO BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE GIVEN THE PROPER BLU RAY TREATMENT BY LIONSGATE.
LONG OVERDUE.
HOPE IT HAPPENS SOON.
IT IS A 5 STAR FILM AND SHOULD BE GIVEN THE 5 STAR TREATMENT.
WOULD IT MAKE IT'S MONEY BACK?
IS THE JESUIT WITH THE FUNNY FISH-HAT CATLIC!
THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH OF HIS FOLLOWERS HANGING OUT TO SEE THIS MOVIE AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN.
THESE PEOPLE AT LIONSGATE WILL BE SNIGGERING ALL THE WAY TO THE ATM!
AND THAT...
IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT!!!

5322252,4,B009E7DVNS,"I have DVD release and it's horrid! However, I was scared to risk buying the Mexican Blu-Ray release, but I am glad I did except for the 2 missing scenes everyone has already mentioned the picture quality while not perfect has far exceeded my expectations for a TV miniseries, and puts the prior DVD version I own to shame. The picture has been restored it's clear and sharp and even the audio is much better than the DVD it would be nice if it was remastered in 5.1, but the Dolby Digital 2.0 is clear and has greater depth than the DVD.

Overall, I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase and it's my favorite and the best movie on Jesus in my opinion. Of course there are things I would have done differently and would have added or changed, but it's still a great classic and masterpiece. Bob",1388188800,,801,4.34
5322253,4,B009E7DVNS,"FIRST, THE GOOD PART: Jesus Of Nazareth has been restored and looks great. They removed MOST of the scratches, flickers, etc. It's even split into four episodes with separate opening and closing credits. Episodes 3 and 4 have different opening credit sequences from the camera pan across the desert with pictures of the stars superimposed over it.

SECOND, THE BAD PART: The fourth episode is missing two scenes. The scene where it Zerah talks Judas into betraying Jesus. And the one after that where Jesus predicts Judas will do so. My thinking is they mistakenly remastered the wrong version of that episode or couldn't find a version of it to restore. I understand that the German version has the same two scenes missing, which likely means a US version would too.

BOTTOM LINE: Love the movie. Slightly disappointed in the missing scenes.",1349568000,10,842,4.922535211267606

8540524,5,B009E7DVNS,"Finally we have here a fine HD transfer of the original 35 mm film to Blu-Ray.  There is sometimes a pink-green tint to something that should be white-blue, but afterall the source is a film print from way back in 1977.  The packaging and on-screen menus are in Spanish in this Blu-Ray set meant for Mexico, but default mode is English audio w/o subtitles, so that is good for us here in North America.  As to story line, it is magnificent.  Best film version ever of the Gospel.  While it is not always accurate to the exact words and places, it does a great job of capturing the spirit of Jesus' message.

8540525,4,B009E7DVNS,"This Blu Ray version is much ""cleaner"" than the original version that's available in the United States. The colors are much more vivid, and I noticed details that I didn't on the original. I only gave it four stars because every once in a while I still see a trace of a line here or there. However, i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a fan of the mini-series. I love the transfer, it's close to perfect!",1396310400,2,423,4.3
8540526,3,B009E7DVNS,"I am posting this in case it helps others, as buying this has gotten quite expensive and I wish I'd had this info when I bought mine.

I give the movie 5-stars but the disc deserves one star, so that averages out to three. Here's why:

This Mexican release has been remastered and is much better quality than the DVD or the German bluray release. So I was hopeful and spent big money for it.

BUT Jesus's eyes look green in most of the scenes. I understand many folks don't believe Jesus really had blue eyes, but Robert Powell was chosen for this role because of his blue eyes. The director chose to have many long closeups with his eyes, had Powell try to not blink, and blue eye liner was even added at times. So his eyes are an important part of the film and the experience of watching this film. So seeing green eyes isn't what was intended or what was seen in the original. I have read that in Passion, Jim Cavaziel's eye color was altered digitally because they didn't want his eyes to be blue, so I wonder if the same decision was made in the Mexican release of Jesus Of Nazareth. If so, I think it was a bad decision.
  If not, then this means blue colors are off and it makes me wonder if other blues are off in other parts of the movie.

The other issue with this bluray, as most folks know, is that two scenes were cut out when this bluray was made. The first missing scene, a Judas scene, is not a big loss. However a good segment of the Last Supper is missing is that really is a huge flaw. The scene where Jesus tells Judas he will betray him is cut, then the scene where Jesus tells Peter that he will deny him thrice is cut. Not only are those compelling scenes, but this version of the film jumps to Judas leaving the room of the last supper and you don't know why or have any context because you just see him standing outside a door and walking away. Then the film takes you into the Last Supper. Who is this man, what room is on the other side of that door, and why is he leaving this room??? It's a bad edit as well as a bad decision to cut those scenes.

For me, the problem with the blue coloring AND these cut scenes are fatal flaws. The DVD may be lessor quality for sure but it is complete and the colors match what the director intended them to be.

The choice is yours now.",1395360000,3,2301,4.120535714285714
