7888060,5,6305311404,"Catdog needs to be released on DVD sometime soon, in 2009 perhaps.  Old School Nichelodeon fans want shows like Catdog to add to their DVD Collection.  Please Catdog on DVD in 2009 or 2010!  At least take a break from SpongeBob SquarePants and put Catdog on DVD Release Schedule!  Please again, release Catdog in the next few years!",1213488000,,332,4.672413793103448
