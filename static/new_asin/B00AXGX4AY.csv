5525772,3,B00AXGX4AY,"I suppose it was the reference to ""cannibals"" in the title that made me think that this would be purely exploitative trash.  But there's a real movie hiding under the surface.

My favorite part of the film is the scenery.  The settings are beautiful and varied, and there were several occasions in which I was surprised to see the main characters interact with live exotic animals.  Yes, some nudity and a couple of sex scenes make it into the film, but the movie overall is surprisingly chaste.  The camera lingers on the beautiful bodies, especially in the early going, but it comes off as more artistic than lascivious.  For a movie that is marketed on the idea of Adam and Eve running away from cannibals, the first half is surprisingly sedate.  The writers did a strong job of adapting the familiar origin story, and also deftly tied in a romantic angle.  As for the acting, the leads are both solid, if unspectacular.  I honestly think they did fine jobs in some pretty physical roles.  There are moments of humor, and the music was better than I could have expected.

There are a few negatives.  The special effects are generally fine, but there are a couple of sequences (ones involving fights with a bear and a bird, and an early scene with Adam and Eve are being expelled from Paradise) when the effects dial down to Mystery Science Theater-worthy images.  For those of you who are annoyed by subtitles, you should know that the film is completely in Italian.  With that said, you could probably watch this film with the sound off completely.  The storyline is easy to follow, and there aren't that many lines to begin with.  The titular cannibals are only really active for about 40% of the runtime, but that's actually the worst part of the movie.  If you're looking for gruesome, gory deaths, you'll probably go away disappointed.  Finally, the film ends rather abruptly after a fairly graphic birthing sequence for Eve.

I should note that this is a barebones DVD -- don't expect any director's commentary or fancy loading screens.  But I recommend giving this movie a try.  It's a lot better than the cover would have you believe.",1421366400,7,2145,4.697050938337801
5525773,3,B00AXGX4AY,"This review is for the newly released (so-called ""Collectors Edition"") DVD-R version of the film.  I've had a (previously purchased) copy of this film that I got from 'Video Source of Miami' some years ago, and the quality of THAT 'transfer' was pretty horrible - so I was a little nervous (but hopeful) in checking out this new pressing.

I'm happy to report that THIS edition of ""Adam and Eve VS The Cannibals"" provides a much improved visual quality over all the other versions previously available!  The picture is presented in widescreen format and is reasonably sharp. The film is in Italian language with English sub-titles - but there is relatively little dialog throughout this primordial tale so the subs are not too annoying

As per the actual film itself - it plays a bit like: ""Blue Lagoon"" meets ""Quest For Fire"".  Initially following the classical Biblical scenario - the tale chronicles the creation of 'man' (Adam) and 'woman' (Eve) - through the 'eating of the forbidden fruit' and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden - THEN - goes off into more of a ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" style direction - suddenly introducing numerous other neolithic humanoids into the mix. The synopsis on the DVD box speaks of Adam and Eve contending with dinosaurs AND flesh eating prehistoric tribes.  In reality - there is only one short 'dino' segment where they fight off a Pterodactyl - but there ARE cave people aplenty and some of them are depicted as cannibalistic in their dining customs. However, despite the 'title' of the film, it should be noted that the 'cannibal' aspect is not really emphasized. Adam and Eve are (rather amusingly) portrayed as a bickering couple (Adam is PO'd that Eve blew it for them by 'eating the apple'!) and at one point they have a spat and become separated - whence Eve gets scooped up by a green guy and assimilated into his tribe for a while. Ultimately (of course) she is re-united with Adam and the whole show culminates in a, fairly graphic, birthing scene as Eve delivers their first child - in the ocean!

Throughout the film there are some pretty clever ideas and attractive images portrayed that are, unfortunately, juxtaposed with some totally cheesy and ridiculous elements - rendering the over-all viewing experience a little uneven.  Altho it looks like there could/should be a fair amount of 'topless' nudity in the film there is relatively little skin on display.  Eve's long blond tresses are kept artfully draped over her breasts throughout (tho there are numerous naked butt shots) - but Adam (who is nearly as 'gorgeous' as Eve) has a set of 'pecs' on him that almost makes up for it! Numerous 'cave women' are shown 'topless' but they are usually 'hairy' or 'painted green' - depending upon the 'tribe' - and relegated to the level of background scenery.

All in all - I found this to be a fun watch - with a refreshingly decent print quality.  Recommended for some light weight prehistoric viewing.  No extras on disc.",1421193600,14,2978,4.783625730994152

5525775,1,B00AXGX4AY,This DVD-R is in Italian language with English subtitles. I tried to change audio but there is no Option for English.,1400284800,,117,4.619047619047619
8558827,4,B00AXGX4AY,"I used to go to a VHS rental store on Telegraph in Michigan that had rare movies.  Like all the rental stores it was free.
Except
If you paid a yearly fee you had access to the side and back rooms.  They even had a book you could go through that listed actors/movie titles.  And, no, they were not pornographic.  (Unless you count that some movies, like Zeffirellis Romeo and Juliet from 1967 was rated X and I had to go to an actual art studio (porn theater) to see it.  This movie might have been a hard R in 1983.)
I found the store exciting because I could find movies and TV episodes with my favorite overseas actors.
Under Mark Gregory there was a listing for Blue Paradise.  Well, I was excited!  I rented it several times.
I, finally, got cable and Showtime ran Blue Paradise.  (I paid extra for Showtime to watch Robin Hood, now known as Robin of Sherwood.  Think, Michael Praed.  Worth the cost)
Move forward from the 1980s to the 2000s and DVD.
No Blue Paradise.
Finally discovered, under Mark Gregory on IMDb, an Adamo ed Eva, la prima storia damore.  It was Italian.  I thought that if it had subtitles, I might have found Blue Paradise.
So, here is a list of what is available online:  Adam and Eve; Adamo ed Eva, la prima storia damore (org. title); Adan Y Eve; Adam and Eve Meet the Cannibals; Adam & Eve vs the Cannibals.
Anyway, I did get this movie in English, it is Blue Paradise and Mark Gregory is still hot.
I just don't get the cannibals title and packaging.  Yes, in this movie they do run into cannibals for about 5 minutes, somewhere in the middle of the movie.
If you are into cannibals, this is not the movie for you.
However, if you are interested in an Italian version of how the earth, man and woman were created, this is a goodie.
Adventures in discovering sex, finding out there are other people already on the earth as you travel on foot searching to return to water, love triangles with Eve and a lot of the men she meets while Adam keeps pushing forward, nice scenery, and some decent laughs, outside of cannibalism.
This may just be the movie for you.
There are some gory scenes not appropriate for youngsters and nudity.
However, for meit is Mark Gregory in more skin that Bronx and Thunder, which is fine with me, a little old leftover hippie lady who usually specializes in cheesy disaster films.  And hot guys with long hair!  What more can I say?",1509235200,,2389,4.383219954648526
