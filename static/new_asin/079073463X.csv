106574,5,079073463X,"Ladyhawke has been, for me, the ultimate love story since it was created nearly 14 years ago.  I was 13 years old when it first hit the theatres and it continues to be my ""hands-down, no competition"" favorite  movie.  Some people are trekkies, some loved M.A.S.H., I love Ladyhawke! I  purchased the soundtrack, bought the poster, wore out my first video  cassette of the film from viewing it so often.  But the culmination of my  obsession (!) happened when I made a ""pilgrimage"" to Aquila,  Italy and visited the cathedral and the castle. If you like Medieval  history and enjoy the legends and myths that illustrate that time so  magically, this movie is for you.  The special effects probably aren't as  special by today's standards, but it is part of the charm of the movie.  Broderick has adorable wit, Pfeiffer has incredible beauty, and the leather  clad Hauer on his stunning black horse is quite the ""captain of the  guard"".",913075200,2,934,4.75
106575,4,079073463X,"Ladyhawke is a fine love story set against spectacular scenery.  There's plenty of action and excitement, and magnificent horses.  The battle scene in the cathedral is a classic, a great climax to a great movie. Broderick's  running conversations with God are entertaining, and the supporting  characters add texture to the tale.  The movie's only fault is its length,  though it's still worth the watch.
P.S. A bit of movie trivia for horse  buffs: Navarre's awesome mount is a Friesian horse.  Friesians are a Dutch  breed renowned for their high-stepping gaits which make them popular as  carriage horses, usually driven in pairs or fours.  They are always black,  and therefore are often desired to draw a hearse in funeral processions.",912124800,,740,5.126050420168068

106688,2,079073463X,"This is a classic movie that we enjoyed from the 1980's, however the video and sound quality are very poor.  It seems that someone recorded a digital version from an old VHS tape.  It certainly is not anywhere near the sound and picture quality that you would you expect for a $2.99 ""SD"" movie rental.",1519344000,,301,4.454545454545454

When I looked closely at the DVD packaging, it states that this DVD will only play on ""play only "" devices and will not play on other DVD devices including recorders.  This was not made clear anywhere on the product description.  I have a fairly standard SONY DVD RW player.  All my other DVDs play on this device.  I've never had this problem with a DVD before.

106692,5,079073463X,A fantastic story set in a time long ago ... my favorite Matthew Broadrick film I first saw in 1985 and it still holds its own today. Michelle Pfeiffer and Ruger Hauer star as lovers divided by magic.,1518393600,,200,4.2894736842105265

106716,3,079073463X,"The movie is fine, but the Amazon prime digital version has awful quality, even for an SD (much worse than VCR), to the point where it's not really fun to watch anymore. In the scene at the end (SPOILER) where Ladyhawke walks into the church, you couldn't even make out her face. In many of the scenes with people talking, their lips were doubled. It appears to be just awful encoding, so I recommend buying the DVD instead.",1516924800,,424,4.448717948717949
106717,5,079073463X,Watched this movie growing up as a kid! Still one of the greatest classic 80s movie. No CGI extra effects! Great music/score and who doesn't love these iconic actors. Great story! It's hard not to quote out loud some memorable movie quotes when watching this movie.,1516752000,,265,4.782608695652174
106718,5,079073463X,I fell in love with Rutgers Hauer the first time I saw this movie years ago! It's still a favorite of mine. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazingly beautiful and so talented and together it makes for the perfect romance. And Matthew Broderick provides comic relief. I love that it's not computer generated and set in France.,1516320000,,315,4.745454545454545
106719,3,079073463X,The movie itself is good but the quality of the image is terrible. Its looks like this was copied from and old VCR. Amazon should not be charging any fees for this movie,1516060800,,169,4.151515151515151

106750,5,079073463X,"Best 80s action movie ever, with a so-bad-its-awesomely-unforgettable soundtrack. Rutger Hauer is fantastica truly under appreciated actor, and Matthew Broderick is a dark ages Ferris Bueller.",1513296000,,192,6.423076923076923
106751,3,079073463X,"I am a fan of the movie. I saw it in the theater when I was much younger. However, I would caution you that the Amazon Video version is not the best conversion, and I am not only referring to the resolution and bit rate. There is significant artifacting and drop-outs throughout the movie. As other reviewers have noted, the video is so blurry as to be unwatchable in some scenes, only to clear up to approximately 480p / DVD quality. I'd like to say get this for the story (cheese aside), but the poor video transfer makes this version impossible to recommend. I still like the story though, and Matthew Broderick steals nearly every scene he's in.",1512864000,2,649,4.508474576271187

106753,5,079073463X,The only medieval fantasy that I know of that has synthesized music... but that adds to the charm I suppose... this very 80's movie will entertain anyone who is a fan of the genre...  The plot is quite good... a very fitting curse to spite  a couples love,1512864000,,255,4.291666666666667

106777,3,079073463X,"Poor film quality. Too blurry to enjoy. We stopped watching after 10 minutes and rented the movie on You Tube which had better visual quality.
As for the film itself it was a mix of good and bad.
Pros: Good story, well done sets (this was before CGI) and some good acting.
Cons: Soundtrack was horribly mismatched - should have been used for an urban Superfly detective thriller or something, cheap costumes, ridiculously fake fight scenes and some dorky dialogue.
Overall a watchable movie but with different director and a better budget it could have been an epic tale.",1510358400,,571,4.777777777777778

This was my favorite movie when I was a pre-teen back in the mid 80's - I had a serious crush on Navarre played by Rutger Hauer - I decided to show it to my hubs for the first time recently, but he ruined it for me - throughout the entire movie he kept laughing at the music, because it's 1980's synthesizer at it's finest, and sure it doesn't really go with the time frame this movie is set in, but it never stood out to me until hubs laughed his head off at it. I still love the movie.",1509062400,3,598,4.254385964912281

106809,5,079073463X,"Classic forever. I will NEVER EVER EVER grow tired of this! Lovely, anachronistic music that somehow still works, actors at the peak of their just-make-me-sigh talent, on location in Spain, scenery, beloved Mouse aka Phillipe Gaston whose dialog is a constant inspiration to me both in my writing and my life.

I realize it is only SD, but this is worse than a 20-year-old VHS tape! The continuous jumping of the screen literally made it impossible to watch. I would guess that anyone would have trouble standing it, but for epileptics, like myself, things like this cause stress, and therefore, most likely, seizures.

While Matt Broderick got top billing and did a creditable job, Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeifer were the real hero and heroine in this adventure.",1500163200,,326,4.45
106889,1,079073463X,"The story is simplistic, the script poorly written, and the acting very ordinary (to be fair, difficult not to be ordinary given the script). The plot has plenty of holes, like all the guards present standing by to let the hero fight them one by one and all the other guards nowhere to be seen. etc. etc.

Make me wonder why all the positive reviews? Nostalgia?",1498780800,,361,4.46969696969697
106890,2,079073463X,"I like all of the major creative personalities in this, but it's a mediocre movie. Anytime it's on I can't make it all the way through. If just a bit more care had been placed on the preparations for it, it might have turned out well. There's such a good humor in spots and the action sequences are precocious with a good sense of energy.  It's strange, the static shots are lovely, but the action begs for better camera movement. The soundtrack only underlines this and makes the entire thing so unfortunate. Richard Donner has made some very entertaining movies, but this movie is mediocre window dressing. It's a waste of talent even if some of the good shows through.",1498608000,,671,4.591666666666667

106892,4,079073463X,"I remember watching this at the theater when it was a new release and thinking it was a great movie. Watching it decades later, it's a Rutger Hauer movie that isn't Blade Runner. Sure, it also stars a young Michelle Pfeiffer and a baby-faced Matthew Broderick. And it's directed by the same guy that brought us The Omen, The Goonies, and most Mel Gibson movies. But, it's still a Rutger Hauer movie that isn't Blade Runner. And that, ultimately, will determine whether you like it or not.",1498176000,3,488,4.620689655172414

107063,5,079073463X,"I realize I am biased. I love this film. I see its faults and I still adore it. I know a lot of people really hate the score. Loathe it, even. I love it. The story is melodramatic, the acting is uneven (except from Rutger Hauer, who crackles throughout) and I don't care. I'm willing to overlook it for the sheer entertainment and watching the beautiful animals (the horses in this film are glorious). Plus there's a young Alfred Molina as Cezar, the Wolf Trapper. Matthew Broderick is, well, Matthew Broderick and he's a medieval Ferris Beuller in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful and ethereal as usual. Leo McKern is adorably gruff and appropriately repentant as a drunken former priest. I think he's sweet in this role. John Wood is creepily awful as the monotone bishop. The cinematography is stunning, from the opening credits on.
Yeah. It's awful, but I love it so much.",1483833600,,885,4.716129032258064
107064,4,079073463X,Great story but is dated by its music score! Very eighties!,1483747200,,59,4.454545454545454
107095,3,079073463X,"I know what you're thinking. This looks like the medieval version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off (chicka-chickaaaa). Well that's exactly what I thought. And I could not have been more spot on. Ladyhawke follows Bueller on another wild adventure. This time, instead of escaping school in the 80s, Bueller gets out of jail in the late 1400s. And what's more, the hot girl turns into a hawk! Not only did they take your standard high school flick and adapt it, the capitalized on it!

Now, as much as I loved this movie, I did not quite understand the soundtrack. Produced by Alan Parsons, I expected something cutting edge. Instead, I found myself lost in wondering how the dark, orchestral tones interacted with the greater religious elements that ultimately played out in one particular scene - yep, (spoiler) it's the one where the man-dog almost dies in the ice water.

With everything that happens in this movie, it warrants a simple 3 stars. That may seem low to some, but having rated Must Love Dogs (starring John Cusack and Diane Lane) 4 stars, I think I know what I'm talking about. The thing that ultimately lost me was the idea of amnesia post-transformation. Each time Ladyhawke and man-dog turn from animal to human, they experience a brief period of amnesia, particularly in the aftermath of traumatic events. The problem is that consciousness does not cease simply because of a transformation in physical state, especially since Ladyhawke and man-dog maintain vivid memory and love for one another throughout the film.

Truthfully, if you find yourself watching this movie, it will likely be on a snow day or holiday. But imagine if the world knew the wonder that is Bueller 2. Imagine if people chose this movie on a Friday night, primetime slot! Will you join me, in gifting this movie to friends and family at every celebratory occasion?",1483660800,,1851,4.85126582278481
107096,5,079073463X,"One of the finest fantasy movies around.  The story is simple (yet very deep).  The special effects are nearly non-existent.  What carries this movie is the characters and they are wonderful characters indeed.  Broderick's Phillipe the Mouse, in particular, makes the show.  His regular talks to God and bravado is balanced very nicely by Hauer's Navarre, a stoic and angry man.  Pfieffer's Isabaeu is so beautiful that you can understand how easily everyone falls in love with her (in their own way).  Richard Donner, as director, knew that the one thing that was needed was for the audiences to believe the characters and the story and be swept away by it.  He didn't do that with a lot of flash but with scenes that made the characters come alive and seem true.  That is what makes this one of the finest fantasy movies of all time.",1483401600,6,835,4.664383561643835

The movie has been brightened to the point of ruining it on a number of levels.  Maybe those who did this thought it would be better if viewers could see details better, but it was brightened so much that it looks grainy and like my photos look if I try to brighten them too much in PhotoShop.

107256,3,079073463X,"Rather silly, comic-book story. Michelle Pfeiffer is Michelle Pfeiffer -  pretty with short hair in this movie, and all she does is make a few sighs and slight smiles - nothing that shows her great acting ability or her monumental sexiness. The other actors I forget the names - they are not names one would remember. Plot is silly, has you wondering if there is a plot. But you figure out the mystery of the cursed laid on Pfeiffer and on the knight in time, and you  figure what is meant by the great the profound wisdom of the old priest ""A night without a day and a day without a night,"" sort of. And it fits, sort of, considering the fighting scenes are childish and the great dramatic buildup to the climax, after the heart-wrenching tragedy of of the hawk being downed by a stray arrow, but of course she is saved by the magical healing ability of the old priest, and in between there is the inconvenience of the snow and ice and - where the hell did this wintery weather come from anyway ? - but I won't tell you how it ends b/c I don't want to spoil it for you.
A fun movie if you don't want your intellect challenged.
Kind of reminds me of another movie in which Jack Nicholson plays opposite Michelle  - as a werewolf. That movie was more believable, with better plot and showcased more fo the acting talents of those actors.",1470787200,,1336,4.314741035856573

It was as if they just took a bargain-rate old VHS tape and digitized it.  The dialogue was also difficult to make out at many times, and I would turn the volume up just to hear the words, only to get blasted in the next scene by the 80s-synth-modern music score at the high end of the volume range.  This movie was fairly well known in it's time and I would expect a far better print is available, but it doesn't seem like anyone bothered to source the digital from that.  It was far from HD quality, and even below the SD option quality of more recent films.  I feel they should have charged me less for this viewing.",1469318400,2,780,4.173333333333333

I've never seen it in the theatre. Now I own a 49"" flat screen and a Blu-ray player and I am finally able to see the movie for the first time. Yes, it is brighter, which often seems to erase the differences between night and day, however, if you've viewed the story as many times as I have that is not an issue. Most of the night scenes tend to be shot in blue light; a clear indication in my mind. I know the story. Now I get to see it! What a difference! This edition is clear and crisp, showing details that I've missed over the years. I played it with the subtitles on because I have a friend who has to do that. They are also crisp and do not, in my opinion, detract from the movie. (If you use subtitles often you learn how to read them and watch the show.) I did not find that lightening up the dark corners overlit the bright ones. It seems like a perfect balance to me.

107467,5,079073463X,"I love this movie and it's soundtrack.  I know not everyone was pleased with director Richard Donner's decision to go with such an unconventional music score.  But I applaud his choice;  in my opinion the music, composed by Andrew Powell and produced by Alan Parsons, distinguished LADYHAWKE from other medieval fantasies.  Films in the genre hadn't performed well at the box office (a notable example had been EXCALIBUR), and it was hoped the more modern music score would give the movie an edge in theaters.  And in general, I feel the music enhanced the feel and mood of the movie.  I love this soundtrack.",1459209600,2,609,4.8076923076923075
107468,5,079073463X,This is my favorite live action fantasy movie. Rutger Hauer is superb as the fallen from grace Captain of the Guard. Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a nuanced performance with the climactic scene conveying such incredible levels of emotion without a word being said. Matthew Broderick provides both the comic relief and the motivating force to resolve a curse cast by a Bishop in a fit of jealousy. A must see for any fan of fantasy movies.,1458950400,,435,4.8133333333333335

107862,5,079073463X,"Recently I saw a review of Ladyhawke and how it looked more like a Ridley Scott film(Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of heaven, and Prometheus) and less of a Richard Donner film (superman, goonies, and lethal weapon) besides his 2000's film Timeline. I honestly think after the original superman and goonies this is his greatest film. Cinematography in this film is amazing especially on this 2015 bluray release which now is the only version of it you should watch. The soundtrack is a hit or a miss and you will need to at least understand 80's soundtracks (Blade Runner, Legend, Michael Mann's The Keep, and 1492 conquest of paradise) to understand why Donner picked the composer. Personally I love the soundtrack. I love this film and this Blu-ray version. Only downfall of it is there is no special feature besides the trailer. Great buy!",1433808000,4,887,4.92

107924,1,079073463X,"Ugh! I hated this movie when I saw it more than 30 years ago. This Richard Donner film came out during the wave of science fiction and fantasy films kicked off by Star Wars' success.  There were certainly more bad films like Krull than good films during this time. I had high hopes for this film because Donner was coming off the success of Superman and the disappointment of seeing Superman II taken away and chopped up as well as failures Inside Moves and The Toy.  And I have to admit that technically, this is a fine film.  I still remember the gorgeous cinematography. But I was totally turned off by the premise that the Bishop somehow had supernatural powers to turn people into hawks and wolves. How did he get these powers? You don't get them by becoming a bishop. A bishop isn't a warlock! You need some major mojo to be able to turn people into animals!  It was never adequately explained.  Also the film tries to hide what exactly is going on, which is always a sign that the movie would fall apart if it told the viewers what was happening, It's a perfect example of Roger Ebert's theory of the ""idiot plot."" I just found this film a huge disappointment. You might too.",1431648000,,1182,4.428571428571429

107941,5,079073463X,"This was the first move my wife (then a friend) and I saw in 1985 so it always held precious memories for us.  I've been hoping for years (almost beyond hope) that it would eventually come out in BD.  Well, while the wait has been long, it has been well worth it - by a long shot!  When I saw that it had finally come out in BD I decided to get a new BD player and Ladyhawke would be the maiden voyage, as it were, for the player.  I knew exactly what that player would be and it is the Oppo 103D.  Both products seemed destined for each other in my HT room.  But this is a review of the movie and not the BD player (but I will say that the reviews of the Oppo players prove true.  It is, by far, the best BD player I have ever owned - bar none.)  I had not watched any versions of Ladyhawke after the first dvd and since the dvd was poorly transferred I decided to wait and hope for the BD.  For those who are fans of this movie it is a staggering achievement in cinematic beauty.  On my Panasonic plasma, Oppo 103D, and Pioneer Elite receiver I would, without question, rate the transfer as reference quality.  The colors bounce off the screen and each frame appears lovingly restored to its' original quality.  It is truly something special.  Now, a word about the music.  Even when I first saw it in the theater I thought the music was a little 'catchy' and appeared not to lend enough quality to the otherwise beautiful movie.  The music seems to get in the way at times. It just seems bothersome. This movie begs for someone like a John Williams or Hans Zimmer (to name a few) composing music on an epic scale.  To be honest if there was a way to view this movie without the soundtrack I'd love to see that.  Further, this movie is so wonderful it could probably stand on its own without music.  But, music or not, this is a priceless gem.",1431129600,9,1845,4.149295774647888
107942,5,079073463X,"My all time favorite film, and that of it's director, Richard Donner. A more romantic film, you will not find. It's about trials and setbacks and perseverance, with one of the best endings for a film ever.

The transfer on the Blu-Ray makes it look like it was shot last year, not 1985. After years of watching the film despite it's transfer, we can see it pristine and beautiful, with vibrant color and sharp details. It was shot in the Italian countryside, and we get wonderful vistas and beautiful cinematography.

We watch the story unfold, and the plot is so wonderfully explained by Leo Kern over a campfire in the film, I will not repeat it here. It's worth it for the performances by Leo Kern, John Wood, Alfred Molina, Matthew Broderick and Rutger Hauer. This isn't an effects movie, it's a story, and Richard Donner (who also made Superman: The Movie) was at the top of his game here. The dangerous parts feel dangerous, the comedy is natural. And, it takes place in a Christian context. No proselytizing, no sermons, just a wonderful throwback to when Christian beliefs were common, and everyone understood them.

I'll take a stab at explaining the soundtrack, produced by Alan Parsons. It's perfectly okay for a soundtrack to sound like the time it came from. So, for those who don't know, here's some context: Alan Parsons produced Al Stewart's ""Year of the Cat"" and made significant contributions to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. In 1982, The Alan Parsons Project made Eye in the Sky, a platinum selling album. I can promise you that you have heard the opening track, Sirius. It was the Chicago Bull's theme during the Michael Jordan era. Somewhere between the tracks ""Children of the Moon,"" ""Silence and I"" and ""Mammagamma,"" you can hear the precursor to the movie's soundtrack.

The scores were written by Andrew Powell, who is most notable for being the music arranger for the debut albums by Kate Bush. There are Gregorian chants, piccolo music and authentic sounding medieval themes in there as well, all written for the film. It was a mix. The full soundtrack was released by GNP Crescendo (ASIN: B000001P1O), where it's rated at 4 and 1/2 stars from 33 reviews.",1431043200,,2188,4.7651715039577835

108034,3,079073463X,"I liked the total package, but was not thrilled with it.  This is definitely a good fantasy movie plot with an unrequited love overstory.  The acting was serviceable, but not compelling.  The resolution worked well and there was a happy ending, which I like.  Others have said that the music is oddly out of place.  I think if there had been a more Medieval/Symphonic soundtrack, I would have liked it a lot more and rated it higher.  As it is, with the Alan Parsons Project music, it is more like 1980's rock.  It just didn't fit well.  I don't mind rock music per se, as in ""A Knight's Tale"" with Heath Ledger.  The story carries that one.  But the Alan Parsons music was just too much for the story in Ladyhawke to overcome.",1424390400,,727,4.398496240601504
108075,5,079073463X,"Great Flick! They don't make movies like this anymore. Matthew Broderick is terrific! I like him better in this movie than his most know role in Ferris Bueller's..... I also like him alot in Max Dugan Returns. As for Ladyhawke, this kind of fantasy also has a lot of believable parts. Two lovers are cursed by a jealous bishop. ""Night without a day, day without a night."" And little Matthew Broderick, a common thief, somehow crosses paths with the wolf and hawk and then things get even more interesting. Rutger Hauer is actually a good guy, haha, and gives an excellent performance. Michelle Phiefer gives a great performance as well!  Don't want to give it away for those that haven't seen it. Much, much better than the Twilight movies. I used that as a comparison cause it's the closest thing to this kind of fantasy. I think the younger generation of today who grew up watching the Twilight and Harry Potter movies should check this 80's classic out. I do like the first Twilight but all the sequels can't hang with it. And Ladyhawke is better, in my opinion anyway. Take care.",1423872000,,1083,4.640625

108078,5,079073463X,"This is a great movie but they only had it in Standard quality format.  Thankfully it was filmed in widescreen.

Overall, this is a gem of a film from the 80s and I would say that it's the best Matthew Broderick, Michelle Pfeifer and Rutger Hauer film made. Directed by Richard Donner, the film is just beautiful.

I love the Alan Parsons music in this film but I will say that the movie goes from very quiet scenes to very loud music so if you have a good soundsystem with a wide dynamic range just be aware.  Alan Parsons did do a great job with the music and the Philharmonic Orchestra gave a great performance.  That said - the music has many 80s and late 70s elements to it so be forewarned.

It's a beautiful love story and I wish they made more movies like that.",1422144000,,769,4.232876712328767

Ladyhawke! My wife agreed: ""That's perfect...you'll really like this one."" (said to our daughter)
It's still a good story. Surprisingly, I found Matthew Broderick to be stilted and not at all natural in the role. The other two leads (Pfeiffer and Hauer) are good in the parts they play.
What killed it for me was the score, done by Alan Parsons. Does anyone remember how simplistic and boring his pop music was? Well, that's what the score is like. The music sounds like that and you can hardly tell the ""fight-scene"" music from the ""love-scene"" music.

108371,3,079073463X,"Ladyhawke is a medieval fantasy movie set in a twelfth century Italian province - one that has dark magic. The movie centers around Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer as star-crossed lovers struggling with a curse. Young thief Matthew Broderick helps them in their quest to undo it.

This should be exactly the kind of movie I adore. It is set precisely in the medieval era I adore. It features sword fights - something I've studied and practiced for years. Broderick's character has delightful humor. I enjoy the fantasy element. So why do I have issues with this movie, and explicitly Richard Donner's directorial decisions, even though I've seen it a number of times?

First, clearly, is the music. I've seen nearly every medievally set movie on the market, and most fantasy movies as well. This is a genre I adore. Parson's music here has to be some of the worst matched music that exists. Sure, part of it is that Alan Parsons created a soundtrack far more thematically matched to Blade Runner (another Rutger Hauer classic) than to this era. But even with that aside, the soundtrack is just BAD. It's heavy handed and in some situations the mood doesn't match at all. You get the over-the-top cliche Jaws music. You get inappropriate music. It's simply not done by someone who understands movie scoring. And it's not just a ""product of its era"", either. Ladyhawke came out in 1985. Conan the Barbarian came out in 1982 and its soundtrack was STUNNING. Basil Poledouris created a tour de force which not only shines as a perfect moment-by-moment emotional echo of the scenes on the screen, but also is a powerhouse as a standalone work of art. So we go from Conan to THIS? Also from 1981 was Excalibur, with its rich, incredible soundtrack by Trevor Jones. Again, both movies were fantasies, set in medieval / past environments. These soundtracks were just perfect in so many ways. The sound that accompanies Ladyhawke greatly detracts from its message.

If there was any way for me to acquire a version of this movie WITHOUT any soundtrack at all, and play my own music instead in the background, I would absolutely do it. I've even considered watching it with subtitles, and no sound at all from the movie, to minimize the harm it causes. Donner has taken full ""credit"" for the musical choice because he was listening to Alan Parsons quite a lot while filming the movie and he loved the music. It's fine for him to love a style of music. It's not fine for him to then force that music into a movie environment where it just doesn't fit.

Next comes the costumes. Again, yes, I understand that sometimes costumes in movies are clearly MEANT to be costumes and not actual outfits. Look at the original Errol Flynn ""Robin Hood"" or the Richard Harris version of ""Camelot"". These were presented more as filmed plays than as action-adventure movies. You took one look at those costumes and realized they were meant to portray a ""shiny clean"" version of the scene, as if it was on a set. And that was all right. That way their style.

But in Ladyhawke, the style is one of gritty reality. Take a look at the scene where the poor peasants agree to let Rutger and his little group stay overnight. They are dirty and rough. Look at how the sword-fighting is styled to be harsh and challenging, rather than play-style combat. So with all of that, the costumes should have been authentic, hand-sewn, and ""lived in"" looking. Take a look at the Russell Crowe version of Robin Hood or Ironclad for a sense of what I mean. Outfits that seem like real people wore them. Instead, here we get shiny, almost polyester looking outfits that came right off a trailer's rack. Pressed. Dry-cleaned. Made of bizarre materials! Yes, I realize this is a fantasy, but it's set like Conan to be a fantasy in a ""real world"" that lives and breathes. Here we're in 12th century Italy. We're not on a polished-wood play set in a high school auditorium. The costume choices continually draw us out of that environment, rather than immerse us into it. And, beyond that, they aren't even proper to the chosen setting. This clearly was Donner's stylistic decision, and it just doesn't fit.

Next, bizarrely to me, comes the swordfighting. The swordmaster in Ladyhawke was William Hobbes, who I adored in Excalibur, and he also handled several other movies including Willow, Rob Roy, the Bergin Robin Hood, Hamlet, and more. I love many of his other swordfights. Hobbes clearly knows his stuff. So I squarely place the blame (again) in Donner's lap. He must have said ""I want them to be clumsy and rough, to give us a raw feel."" But the result is that it looks incredibly silly. It's as if this Captain of the Guard, a man at the top of his form, a man who could hold off entire groups of talented soldiers on his own, could be exhausted in just a few blows. And even there, the fight isn't done well. It's like they're randomly hacking at each other. This man wouldn't have lasted five minutes in a battle with the characters from many of Hobbes' other films.

Also, very strangely, Rutger Hauer is wielding a sword extremely similar to a Zweih&auml;nder - a German longsword used by mercenaries in the 1400s - 1500s. I say strangely, because this is the exact sword Rutger wielded in Flesh and Blood, the film he was in from earlier in 1985. Of course, in Flesh and Blood Hauer WAS a mercenary in that time frame, so his use of the sword made perfect sense. Here, in Italy in the 1100s, it makes zero sense. Again, the director just picked and chose things he wanted and stuck them in.

The plot is a fantasy, and I do like the wolf-by-night, hawk-by-day aspect of it. I like the interplay of the characters and the progression. But there are moments where a twist in the plot feels incredibly contrived and forced there for ""need to move the story in this direction"" reasons rather than actual storyline reasons. Moment 1 - when the hawk is wounded and Hauer hands his near-death true love over to a known-to-be-inconsistent thief to get her to safety. Yes, you could say that Hauer was going to turn into a wolf later on and a wolf carrying a hawk probably results in hawk dinner. However, Hauer knows where the monastery is, and he knows how far it is. He is a FAR better horseman than Broderick is. And even at Broderick's lackadaisical pace, he makes it to the monastery well in advance of nightfall! The monk has time to meander around and find some herbs before he can even begin to work. So absolutely Hauer COULD have raced his true love there, helped with the preparations, and then waited outside the walls as a wolf while the work was done on her. He could have ensured she safely got to her destination. Instead, he just hands her away to someone he can't really trust. Not the action of a hero, in my mind. They could have come up with a far more realistic plot reason that he couldn't go.

Second, which is far worse in my mind, is near the end where Hauer finally decides to do something. I say ""finally"" because apparently he's spent the past two years doing nothing at all. He could have been pressuring the Bishop to remove the curse. He could have been researching ways to end the curse. Heck, he could have been studying how to read and write so he and his lady love could write each other letters every day and communicate that way. But no, he simply wanders around for two years and then at the very end decides to kill the Bishop out of revenge. Now, this isn't the bad part. I could at least accept revenge as a silly but understandable action. No, what bothers me is that Hauer decides that, should he fail, that his TRUE LOVE SHOULD BE SLAUGHTERED because of course she wouldn't want to live a day without him. What??? He doesn't ask her. He just assumes that she'd rather be dead than live in a world without him in it. Maybe she'd be happy in a nunnery, writing songs! Maybe she'd be happy healing the sick. There are a myriad of things she might prefer to having her neck snapped without being asked. And what makes this even worse in my mind is apparently lots of viewers find this ""sweet and romantic"". What?? And I suppose it was sweet and romantic when, in Hauer's previous film, Flesh and Blood, he did the exact same thing. When Hauer's character in Flesh and Blood thinks a rescuer might come in and save his blonde girlfriend, he decides to suffocate her to death rather than have her live with another guy. Romantic? Sweet? How about psychopathic? Is this the kind of male ""hero"" we want to idolize? And why do so many viewers watch it and cheer him along?

So, lots of issues here. Again I point the blame squarely at the director. The musical team is phenomenal - just not suited at all for this task. The swordmaster is amazing - but he was instructed in a bizarre fashion. The costume designers made gorgeous costumes - they're just ridiculous in this setting. The plot has enormous issues.

Even if you said ""this is a cool movie for kids"" - do we want to be teaching kids that a hero plans on snapping the neck of his heroine if he runs into a problem, and this is great? That he abandons her to a random stranger if he runs into trouble? That, when faced with a challenge, he just rides randomly around for two years and then decides on slaughtering someone out of revenge rather than seeking a solution?

There was so much which could have been amazing about this film. I greatly wanted it to succeed. But the director made a series of poor choices, and the entire project suffered as a result.

Rating: 3/5.",1393804800,2,9525,4.540477577169482
108372,3,079073463X,"I remember seeing this as a child and enjoying it immensely.
Seeing it now though... its not as enjoyable as I remember.

From the miscast Broderick to the sappy music which overwhelms everything and kills all sense of awe and power.
Why the film makers decided not to hire a good film composer... I don't know.
Why they cast Ferris Bueller, I don't know that either.

I hope someday... if and when someone decides to remake this. They address those issues.

The film could work in a purely fantastical setting without tying it to some past era, much like a classic Disney fairytale.

In the roles;

I could see Michael Fassbender as Navarre. He could be menacing as the wolf and deeply romantic where he needs to be.

As for the role of Isabeau; I see Kate Bracken or Claire Foy in the role. Someone with a fresh face... not familiar or well known to the world right now. Although, Bracken's accent might be a bit hard to hide.

The role of ""Mouse"" Phillipe Gaston would be right up Russel Tovey's alley although he might be a tad bit too old or playing too familiar a part.

As for Aquila: They could go with Ian McShane or cast a female actor to the role like Helen Mirren.

108386,4,079073463X,"If fairy tales are to be believed love can overcome all obstacles.  In the case of Richard Donnors 1985 fantasy Ladyhawke a tale of love overcomes an unfocused script and incredibly dated 80s synthesizer score to create one of Hollywoods best fairy tale romances outside of Walt Disneys animated features.  This films principle story of love is told without irony and reminds me that sometimes a simple tale of love is all a fantasy needs to capture its audiences hearts.

The film stars Matthew Broderick as Phillipe, a young thief who has just escaped the dungeons of the Bishop (played by John Wood).  He is an opportunistic pickpocket who wisecracks and manipulates his way through every situation.  Fate brings him to meet Navarre (Rutger Hauer), a black clad knight always accompanied by a red-tailed hawk.  Through their travels each night Navarre disappears and a young woman named Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) takes his place.  It turns out that Navarre and Isabeau are lovers cursed by the evil Bishop to never truly be together with Isabeau becoming a hawk by day and Navarre turning into a wolf by night.

If you cant already tell a problem with this description let me make it clear: Phillipe is not the star of this story.  The wisecracking thief has a few good lines (one about talking with God is particularly memorable) but he doesnt undergo much of a journey in this film.  Rutger Hauers Navarre is clearly the real hero of this story, and the one who undergoes the most development as a character.  This result in many scenes of Matthew Broderick rambling (clearly intended to entertain young audiences in the 1980s) that now only seems to distract from Navarre and Isabeaus story.

Another thing that cant be ignored is Andrew Powell and Alan Parsons score.  It is unabashedly a producer of the 80s, and when it came in the opening credits I couldn't contain a burst of laughter.  Unlike Labyrinth and other 80s fantasy films which employed such soundtracks Ladyhawke takes place in a fairly realistic world, with the lovers curse being the only fantasy element to the story.  This makes the more contemporary score stand out like a sore thumb.  Now, to be fair, about 30 minutes in the theme did grow on me (even if only in a campy, 1980s sort of way).  There are some appropriately tender moments to this score where it works, especially during some of the quiet scenes between Navarre and Isabeau, but I don't think anyone will deny that a traditional orchestral score would have fit the film far better.

At the end of the day it is the romance between Navarre and Isabeau and Richard Donnors stellar direction that saves Ladyhawke from being an awkward 80s fantasy flick.  Hauer and Pfeiffers performances are so sincere, and in just a few simple facial expressions and words they successfully convey these twos feelings for each other.  It is such a basic story, yet I couldn't help but be sucked into these two characters situation, and found myself actively rooting for them from start to finish.  If you don't feel a sense of euphoria at the films end than surely your heart is made of stone, because this is fairy tale romance at its best.

Some people will write the film off for the musical score, and fairly predictable plot (it is a fairy tale, after all), but when you cut it down to the love story Ladyhawke is fantasy-romance at its very best.  Richard Donnor captures a sense of innocence, and overwhelming hope in this tale, and for that I am giving Ladyhawke a full recommendation for any fantasy fans and viewers who just want a good romance.",1392508800,,3582,4.741935483870968

Vittorio Storaro, the cinematographer, was point on and Richard Donner had an excellent screenplay to work his magic as director.  I saw this with my children when it was released and they were fascinated with the story, which would lead me to believe that Disney should look into producing this as one of their animated tales.",1391731200,,620,4.951923076923077

108416,5,079073463X,"BLU-RAY REVIEW: I will split this review into 3 sections - seller, actual movie and (most importantly) this version / transfer of the Blu-Ray:

1) Seller - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Shipped from Honk Kong for only $3.99 and it arrived in 5 days. I purchased this from ""Far East Flea Market"" -  that becomes very relevant when you get to the ""version / transfer"" section. I will definitely be looking for other items from this seller. In fact - I've already ordered a second copy of Ladyhawke from them.

2) I won't spend a lot of time here as I figure if you are looking for / at the movie you are already a fan. Suffice it to say I saw it 6 times when it was released and I bought the VHS, then the Laserdisc and then the DVD as soon as they were released and have hunted forever for the Blu-Ray. This is one of my all-time favourite movies and I consider it to me Michelle Pfeiffer's best role. (Right up there with Batman Returns and Grease 2....ok, so I've had odd tastes.) If you haven't seen it - buy it or rent it now! (And I forget that Rutger Hauer can actually be handsome and charming. Matthew Broderick's accent is a bit weird - but he still brings such life and wit to his character you end of forgetting about the accent.)

3) Now the important part: Version / Transfer. This is where Far East Flea Market comes in. There are many versions of this movie listed for Blu-Ray in various formats and regions by various sellers. The version from Far East Flea Market is NTSC and non-region coded (technically the packaging lists regions A, B & C). That's the one you need in the US. Nothing in the description or on the packaging says anything regarding it being ""Digitally Remastered"" but after watching it on a 70"" Mitsubishi DLP HD TV and a  50"" plasma I'd say this is as good, if not better, than all the movies from that era being released and touted as ""Digitally Remastered"". The picture is sharp and the sound is great. Now - I am by NO means an audiophile expert - but these are the VERY nit-picky things I noticed. I'd have to go back and watch my DVD or Laserdisc to see if the same holds true there. A few of the outdoor daytime scenes seem ever so slightly washed out. However, that may be because so much of the movie (both daytime and nighttime and especially dusk) pop like they were recorded originally in HD in the last couple of years. Some of the outdoor vistas even rival some of the National Geographic and Discovery Channel HD recordings. Keep in mind - this was filmed in 1985. I was amazed and pleasantly surprised by the sharpness, crispness and colour of the transfer. The soldiers' red capes and the landscapes and Michele's blue eyes POP!. And I had forgotten just how rich and majestic Goliath is. His blackness gleams and the details of his main and tail really stand out. The sound has incredible stereo separation. It's one of my all-time favourite scores - plus I'm a huge fan of Alan Parsons. The more melodic pieces with the dialogue are just breathtaking. The action sequences with the more upbeat score seems a little muddled at times as it seems the majority of everything is sent to the center channel for some reason. Same thing with the kick drum - it seems to only go to the center channel and also seems a little flat. I didn't notice the deep subwoofer rumble as much as on a ""modern"" movie. I thought maybe it was just me and kept telling myself that this was a movie from 1985 - but the 30 second clip at the end where the eclipse occurs is mixed PERFECTLY and the entire room resonated like a modern movie theater. Again - let me reinforce that I am NOT saying there are any problems whatsoever with this transfer. And I state again that in my opinion this is as good as if not better than nearly every 70's / 80's movie I've purchased on Blu-Ray that touts being ""Digitally Remastered."" If you are a fan od this movie - in my humble opinion this is the version you want to add to your collection. HUGE THANKS to Far East Flea Market for making this available and for having the correct description!

If you are a fan of this move - or even curious - rush out and buy it from them IMMEDIATELY and don't get stuck with one of the Italian or poor transfer versions I've read about in other reviews.

Thanks!",1390780800,,4256,4.345911949685535

I found Matthew Broderick's character to be very entertaining. He narrates the movie through his ongoing conversation with God, which is quite delightful.
Rutger Hauer plays the handsome exhiled night who transforms into a wolf when the sun goes down, and Michelle Pfifer play his beautiful lover who transforms into a hawk when the sun rises. Pfifer's beauty far outshines any modern actress, plus she can actually act.
They are aided by and exhiled monk in their quest to break the curse they have been living under.
The special affects are not spectaculat but this is an old movies, and seems a bit low budget as well. The country side where it was filmed is beautiful and the acting is very good.

108623,5,079073463X,"Though I wish the video quality was higher, I cannot wish for a finer story of love. Set in medieval Europe, the story follows young Phillipe, the ""Mouse"", an intrepid thief who speaks to God every time he needs His help (which is a lot). Escaping from the dungeons of Aquila, The Mouse flees from the Bishop's guards into the country side. There, he is saved from the Bishop's men by a mysterious knight named Navarre, a man clad in black armor and a deep melancholy. Navarre is the former Captain of Aquila's Guard, where he fell in love with a young maiden named Isabeau, who came to love him in return, secret from all but the monk they shared. Coveted by the bishop, Isabeau is the unlucky focus of his lust and envy. Unfortunately, their priest had a weakness for wine, and in a drunken confession to the Bishop, unwittingly informed him of the lovers' secret vows to each other. Navarre and Isabeau were then cursed fleeing from the Bishop's jealous rage. Two years before Phillipe is saved by Navarre, the Bishop, with the Devil's aid, cast a curse upon the lovers to keep them separated forever. She, a hawk by day and a maiden by moonlight; he, a knight bent on revenge by day and a protective wolf by night. Only catching a glimpse of each other in the seconds between day and night, the two are condemned to live this way for as long as they both shall live.

Navarre seeks Phillipe's aid in returning to Aquila to exact revenge upon  the Bishop, and along the way Phillipe befriends both Isabeau and Navarre. Struggling with his faith and sanity, Phillipe manages to both aid the lovers in getting revenge and destroying the curse. While the story is kept simple and filmed in beautiful landscapes, the movie suffers only when the video quality and the musical score detract from the plot. I have loved this film since I was a child, and with adult eyes I am able to notice small plot details I missed way back then. It makes me cry every time I watch it, and nothing is more enjoyable then watching love triumph in situations of hopeless despair.

108685,5,079073463X,"This is one of my favorite fantasy movies of all time and to be honest, in my opinion, perhaps the second best of the two best fantasy movies of the Eighties. The other one being Dragonslayer. The rest of course were pretty awful to forgettable, but this one really stands out.

In escaping from the dungeons of Aquila - an unprecedented feat, apparently - Phillipe ""The Mouse"" Gaston sets into motion a chain of events that will either result in the saving of a pair of cursed lovers or lead them all to their doom. Along the way he encounters the lovers themselves: The dark and brooding Captain Etienne Navarre (Rutger Hauer in one of his best roles, I think) and Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer). He finds himself eventually encountering the repentant Monk Imperious (played by Leo McKern). The acting in this movie is excellent from beginning to end. Hauer is slightly campy, Pfeiffer has been called 'ethereal' and her line ""I am sorrow"" I think is perfectly delivered. Leo McKern as the repentant Monk is by turns grumpy, querulous, wise and funny. Finally Matthew Broderick is entertaining as always.

The villains are dark and full of nasty. They may seem a little bit two-dimensional but I think that John Wood (The Bishop of Aquila) and Ken Hutchinson (Marquet) both did very good jobs.

The movie is a little slow moving, to be honest and it is very romantic but it should have enough action to hold most peoples attention and much of the scenery is very beautiful.

I will not say much about the soundtrack to this wonderful movie: It has been called everything from 'dated' to 'inappropriate' for a medieval fantasy to 'the worst soundtrack ever composed for a movie"". In the end why it was decided to use Allan Parsons to compose the soundtrack is likely only known to the crew involved in the decision. What I want to say about it is simple: Allan Parsons Project is one of my favorite composer/performer/bands of all time and without this movie I may never have heard of him.

Rousing adventure, a bit of magic, a great villian, lots of manly derring do and a spot on sense of humor thanks to Matthew Broderick who is a great stand in for the audience.

Only criticism is the music which dates the film and makes it of its time (the 80's.) My wife and I wondered how a redux of the soundtrack with all the wonderful Celtic music of the past 30 years might up-date the film.",1355961600,2,600,4.300884955752212

We were lucky enough to find a copy at the local library.  Well worth requesting a copy.

The basic movie is about  a fairytale like curse placed on a couple.  One turns into a wolf at night
and one into a hawk during the the day.  You don't get a fuller understanding of the curse and who
placed it on them until about 1/3 to half the way through the movie.

The movie includes several very well known actors and starts out with Matthew Broderick (just before his Ferris Bueller fame<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ferris-Bueller-s-Day-Off/dp/B001D0DQUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>)
as a prisoner escaping the evil Bishop of Aquila (John wood)
Soon we get to meet Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer as the fairytale couple with the cure.
From there is the adventure to remove the cure and get revenge.

What is so good about this film?  Well for one it is clean compared to some period type films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Name-Of-The-Rose/dp/B005IAVJB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Name Of The Rose</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart-Sapphire-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000NQRE0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray</a>], etc.
The story is one of good verses evil, light and dark, and true love.
Full of knights in shining armor, beautiful horses and plenty of people in distress.
The music at times is very eighties, and the costumes a bit over the top.
There is some fighting.  And the sword play is a little cheesy.  The swords don't seem very legit at one point in the film.
Overall the locations, castles, and towns are as good as any film.

Interestingly, the bad guys are all dressed in white and the good guy is in black.  Draw your own conclusions about that.

You feel good at the end of the movie as things get resolved, the cure is broken and the thief mends his ways.  You begin to really pull for the main characters.

This is definitely a film you can see with your children.  Not super young ones but, 8 years and up though it does have a PG-13 rating.  You might have some explaining to do since traditionally good authority figures are the bad guys in this movie.

If you like or have any of the following films you will like this one.  Truly a film for the whole family with clean fun had all around.

There was the flaw that the moon shown the evening before the eclipse was the wrong lunar phase, and then there was the music!  This romantic, mystical story with cinematography reflecting this mood, had peculiarly loud ""fight scene"" music that blasted forth destroying the overall feel.  Ah well, it probably worked for 13 year old boys who watched to lust over Michelle Pfeiffer.",1347148800,,496,4.951807228915663
108793,5,079073463X,"I loved this film! Ladyhawke is probably one of my favorite movies. I think I first watched this on TV during the 1990's but not sure.

Several critics mention that the film score by Alan Parsons is a bit misplaced in this film set in the middle ages. I suspect the background music may be the very reason I liked the film so much. As any young man of the time, I'm a Pink Floyd and Alan Parson's fan. Maybe that's one reason I liked the film so much. Ladyhawke was nominated for an Oscar in the category of sound effects. Those horses clomping around sounded so real. I bet they were!

I suspect this film may be based on a true story. . . I held a friendship once with someone who was living in the Philippines - and just as I would wake up in the morning they were going to bed. We were two souls who couldn't meet. The feeling reminded me of this film. I suspect the author, Edward Khmara, may have ties to India or Malaysia and may have been writing about what he knew. A true story, so to speak.

I gotta admit (spoiler alert) I didn't really like the ending much. Or rather the ending after the ending. It seemed kinda unnecessary, having the Bishop try and stab the beautiful maiden at the very end of the film, to try and keep the lovers apart, apparently. You think the Bishop would be used to the idea of not getting the girl after that much time had passed.",1346803200,,1369,4.178030303030303

108797,5,079073463X,"After reading the excellent reviews from buyers of David Ho (boyoyo) from Hong Kong, I purchased the region-free Bluray. My order was processed quickly and I received an email with shipping info and a link to their web site, which made me feel better about purchasing from overseas. The Bluray arrived sooner than the approximate arrival date (yay!) and I had to sign for it, something I didn't request so the seller must have - another plus for his attention to detail.

As for the Bluray itself: fantastic. I had to ask myself if the picture was this clear in the theater (where I saw it three times)! Having since watched the movie on VHS for almost 3 decades, the picture quality is simply phenomenal, crisp and bright - so good that you can see the detail and texture and true color of the costumes even better. You can even see split-second shots which don't show up on the VHS version.

My only complaint is that in two night scenes, some shadows appear like grainy dark red blots, like the movie is being watched on an old TV set where the color/contrast/hue needs adjusting. I assume when the movie was being formatted for Bluray that this was a technical problem which couldn't be fixed without affecting the quality of the rest of the shot. Or maybe it has something to do with the disc being region free?

Nevertheless, I recommend any Ladyhawke fan to purchase this Bluray. IT'S WORTH THE PRICE.",1343174400,,1408,4.601593625498008

108799,5,079073463X,"Phillipe Gaston ""The Mouse"" (Matthew Broderick) a thief who has escaped the dungeons of Aquila, is a young man trying to come to terms with what is the right path to take in the world and become a better person. He talks to himself and God throughout the film - which makes the humor all the more endearing.  While trying to battle his conscious in the most trying situations, he stumbles across two star-crossed lovers in the midst of an evil Bishop's curse who sold his soul in order to curse the lovers because he could not have Isabeau for himself. Forever together yet eternally apart, Navarre (Rutger Hauer) and Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) have watched over each other since the curse was cast. By day, Isabeau is a beautiful hawk, and at night, a beautiful woman - alone except for Navarre the wolf by night who loves her. As the tale unfolds, Navarre is taking the trio back to Aquila to avenge their honor, when the hawk is injured and only Father Imperius (Leo McKern) the Monk who betrayed them can save the hawk. Together all four are on the quest of a lifetime to set their world to right. The most touching scene in the movie is when they almost touch at daybreak, and the curse moves in just in time to keep the two from even being able to touch.
I rate this movie in one of my top 10 as I love this era - with all the chivalry and honor it entailed.  It contained humor, love, and intrigue, all the makings of a well rounded movie. You will no regret giving this movie a chance to enchant you, as it did me.",1338076800,2,1523,4.321678321678322
108810,5,079073463X,I read in an earlier review that the music was disco medieval. I wouldn't actually call it that but it is definitely different.

Rutger Hauer plays a great knight and he wields the sword like a master. I would recommend this movie for fans of sword fighting and sorcery.,1336608000,,397,4.4520547945205475

108812,5,079073463X,"This review is for the Hong Kong import Blu-ray of LADYHAWKE.  Although I procured my copy from a source other than Amazon, I thought I'd still chime in with my opinion here.  Bottom line -- if you are a fan of this film, it is absolutely worth the cost, and the wait for your import copy to arrive from overseas, to get this disc.  LADYHAWKE looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the best I've ever seen it since I missed it on its original theatrical release.  I think I must have discovered it in college on home video after I became a Michelle Pfeiffer fan.

The colors on this disc are rich and detailed and the picture is about as sharp as you could ask for, even on my 720p display (I imagine it would look even better in 1080p).  A huge THANK YOU to 20th Century Fox for making this an all-region disc, even though I had to import it.  The only downside is a lack of special features.  To Warner Bros., holder of the North American rights, NOW will you get off your collective duffs and make a proper special edition?!?

The fantasy and romance aspects were, I thought, well done. In the end, the curse is undone, the bad guy gets his dues, and the lovers are reunited!

I thought the acting of the male lead (Rutger Hauer) was a little understated. But then, it was SO refreshing to see a movie like this that wasn't full of arguing, yelling, and stupid, overdone special effects.

The only irritating aspect is the character of Phillipe. Early in the movie, he talks too much, far more than a man on the run would. But his character improves as the story goes on.

Good entertainment, especially if you like medieval-style fantasy.",1319500800,,767,4.543478260869565
108844,5,079073463X,"Ladyhawke is a darling fantasy adventure that shows off the striking features of Michelle Pfeiffer, the humor of Matthew Broderick, and Rutger Hauer's penchant for playing stoic and vengeful characters. Not to mention some incredible scenery and animals.

But let's face it. The Region 1 (United States/Canada) DVD stinks. It's on a tiny screen even if you happen to have a big screen (they call THAT ""letterbox""?!) and the quality isn't much better than on a VHS tape. Those aforementioned striking features and incredible scenery? They're not striking and incredible any more. However, the company that made this DVD (Warner Home Video) didn't make the non-US versions, thankfully, so if you want to see this movie as it should be seen--in anamorphic widescreen with the same aspect ratio as shown in the theaters--get another version. You have several choices:
* Buy the Region 2 DVD. 20th Century Fox did a great job on the transfer. The guards' uniforms are really red again, and the sunrises and sunsets are phenomenal! The down side is that you have to either have a region-free player or a way to make DVD and player play nicely together.
* Buy the region-free Blu-ray. I haven't seen this and so can't compare. It appears that Fox produced this one also, so there's hope that it's been done well. It may become the best and easiest choice for North Americans . . . once it's available for sale more widely.
* Watch on Amazon Instant Video. I compared this to the Region 2 version, and it appears to be the same aspect ratio, using the full width of the screen, so it's a definite improvement over the Region 1 DVD. However, the colors aren't nearly as vivid as the Region 2, and the night scenes are harder to see. It's also blurrier, which makes sense since it would be hard for a streaming version to have the same resolution.

Warner Home Video did such a lousy job on this DVD that it was hard for my family to watch and enjoy. I'm so glad that viewers have other, better options.",1318377600,2,1993,4.643059490084986

108848,2,079073463X,"As medieval fantasy adventure goes, Ladyhawke is passable. The conceit of the lady being a hawk by day and her sweetiepie a wolf by night is clever. And it's decently executed here by director Donner, and stars Broderick, Hauer, Pfeiffer and McKern. But the music score? Who, even in the 80s, thought that something like this was a good idea for a medieval story? This awful score would barely do justice to a Starsky & Hutch or Magnum PI--where it actually might kind of properly belong.

108870,4,079073463X,"The musical score which later approaches perfection in its subtle support of action, dialogue and scenery is at first an equally glaring, overstated distraction that mars the opening credits of ""Ladyhawke"" and for bad measure rears up again during the end credits. Setting this point aside for the moment, to watch Goliath's strut and hear Gaston's humorous asides to God are both well worth the research time involved in and price of finding this beautiful but now-disappearing movie. While cementing Rutger Hauer's royal stature in science fiction circles, the film includes additional performances of conviction from Matthew Broderick, Leo McKern, Alfred Molina (yes, he of much later ""Spider Man 2"" infamy), Michelle Pfeiffer and John Wood. It is Wood - and to an extent lessened only by his minor role, Molina - that reminds us how to best play a villain: strike fear in the best intentioned heart not by brute posturing or aimless rants, but with steady movements, even steadier gazes and a powerful voice delivering crisp words adrip with sinister intent. (Other great examples: Darth Vader and The Emperor throughout the ""Star Wars"" saga, & Jacob Kell in ""Highlander: Endgame."") Consider how differently the male characters each utter just the name ""Isabeau"" at various points in this story to see, hear and best of all feel what they mean by so doing. The problems keeping ""Ladyhawke"" from five-star territory (a grainy DVD transfer, lack of audio commentaries and interviews, and the aforementioned score) beg to be resolved by a deluxe treatment similar to that given its equally excellent and similarly soundtrack-challenged 1985 sibling-in-fantasy, Ridley Scott's ""Legend.""

Actors are all outstanding including Michelle Pfeiffer, Rutger Hauer,Leo McKern and John Wood.  But, Broderick is a real winner as the ""mouse.""  He is a thief who talks to God and becomes drawn in to the tragic love story.  But like all good fairy tales, there is a happy ending.

108872,5,079073463X,"This is an adventure story of medieval times, just after a crusade, when pious bishops were political leaders, thought nothing of using black magic, and considered the hanging of a thief the epitome of piety. It is filled with sword fights and love. It concerns a young lying pickpocket, who adds humor to the tale, who escapes the bishop's dungeon and is perused by his armed forces, for ""no one can escape my prison."" It is about a brooding knight, who is the hero of the film, and his hawk, and a beautiful woman and her wolf. The knight disappears during the night and the woman during the day. It involves an agonizing priest who sinned and is seeking how to repair his offense against God and man.

 The boy is found by the bishop's forces and is saved by the knight and his hawk. He joins the knight because he knows how to get into the bishop's walled city and the knight wants to enter it secretly. Later, during the night, the boy is attacked by an avaricious thief with a hatchet and is saved by the wolf who comes with the beautiful lady who disappear. The soldiers tell the bishop that the knight has returned and the bishop is troubled. He is afraid that the knight will kill him, for the knight tells the boy that his quest is to kill the bishop. But there is a problem. The agonizing priest explains that if the knight kills the bishop what he wants to accomplish will fail.

 Viewers will enjoy finding out who are these people, what happened to them in the past that made the knight want to kill the bishop, why is the knight brooding, what sin did the priest commit, why is the hawk always with the knight and the wolf always with the woman, how will the film end?",1299628800,,1683,4.350318471337579

Michelle Pfeiffer is absolutely stunning, as alway, if only her character had some more depth.  Mathew Broderick plays it a little, well actually a lot too Ferris Bueller.  Ferris Bueller in the Court of the Evil Medieval Bishop just doesn't work.  Rutger Hauer is wooden and  Leo McKern and Rutger Hauer's horse both overact their parts.  When the horse prances in to the Chapel it's just silly.

In today's movies we have so come to expect a good score that we don't notice how it moves the film along and fills it out.  The score in this film, by Alan Parsons is abysmal.  Rather than carry the film along it makes us pull up short.  Whenever they went riding in the countryside I cringed, having to listen to more of that dreadful music. Ths film makes it very clear, by its noticeable absence, just how much a good score does for a film. This film needed a great score to work - it didn't get one. Music helps make the magic - it helps you suspend disbelief. Here it was a sharp tug on the reins.

The storyline,simply put: star crossed lovers doomed to never meet again because of the jealousy of a wicked Bishop.
Well, they do meet, albeit ever so momentarily at dawn, before the sun rises and touches their eyes and Rutger is once again human but Michelle becomes a Hawk. Their desire is to break the curse and continue their lives. Thus the story continues.
Of course Rutger and Michelle are the lovers and poor Matthew is the child caught in the middle. Well, he's more of a soul that gets caught up in the power of love.

108884,5,079073463X,"This past weekend I watched Ladyhawke, a 1985 flick, again. I was drawn into the fantasy world of Etienne Navarre and Isabeau d'Anjou, two lovers cursed by the Cardinal whose love Isabeau had scorned. The only drawback to this wonderful film is the soundtrack. I'd love to see them re-score this film. I'd be in line to get a copy of it.

This emotion-drenched story is so compelling, so well-acted by the young and beautiful Rutger Hauer as Navarre and Michelle Pfeiffer as Isabeau, but the soundtrack is so jarring and inappropriate for a love story that sweeps you away to medieval times. You don't just suspend disbelief at the fantasy story so much as you fling it into oblivion. The desperation and despair of the two ill-fated lovers is wrenchingly believable.

Directed by Richard Donner, 7 years after he did the original Superman movie and 2 years before he directed the first Lethal Weapon film, the set of Ladyhawk was where Donner met Lauren Shuler who produced Ladyhawke. The couple subsequently married and remain married today. They were both honored with a double star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in October 2008. he shows why he's such an amazing director. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and for several science fiction awards.

Edward Khmara wrote the story and the screenplay. (Writers, you can learn from Mr. Khmara's screenplay because it works on so many levels.) The Warner Brothers marketing department said the movie was based on a true medieval legend. Of course, Mr. Khmara, who created the story from his writer's imagination, took issue with that claim. He took his complaint to the Writers Guild Association and was awarded a cash settlement from Warners. However, the medieval legend claim had a life of its own by then.

Because of Ladyhawke, I decided to forgive Mr. Khmara for his other 1985 work, the horrendous Enemy Mine starring Dennis Quaid and Lou Gossett as a pregnant male alien. Mr. Khmara went on to write Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story, 1993, another of my favorite movies.

Ladyhawke has the tagline: Cursed for eternity. No force in Heaven will release them. No power on Earth can save them. The movie starred Matthew Broderick, fresh from his War Games star turn, as Philipe Gastone, a thief who escapes from the dungeon at Aquila. He's nearly captured, but Captain Navarre rescues and befriends him. Navarre has been hunted by the evil Bishop's men for two years, ever since he escaped with Isabeau, the object of the Bishop's lust. Since the Bishop couldn't have Isabeau, he cursed her and Navarre. By night, Navarre is a wolf; by day Isabeau is a hawk. They are always together, yet always separated. Navarre wants Philipe help him re-enter the city so he can kill the Bishop.

Broderick's character is am amusing distraction, but the real acting heavy hitters are Hauer and Pfeiffer. Rutger Hauer is so completely believable as the tortured knight in love with a woman he can only see when he's in the shape shifting form of a wolf. Pfeiffer is electric as the Isabeau who loves her knight. Wolves and hawks mate for life, just as these two cursed lovers.

Hauer's role was three years after his mortality-conscious android in Blade Runner, another favorite of mine. Michelle Pfeiffer played Isabeau after paying her dues through years of television performances and 3 previous movies: Grease 2, Into The Night, and the infamous Scarface. John Wood, also in War Games with Broderick, was the evil Bishop of Aquila. He's so good that you instantly hate him. Leo McKern, the late Australian actor who some always thought was English, played Father Imperius the Monk. He set the whole story in motion by betraying a confession to the Bishop who then cursed the lovers. Naturally, he's the one who knows how to break the curse.

Some movies transcend their flaws. The epic love story Ladyhawke is such a movie, and it possesses the power to win a new generation of viewers.",1280707200,,3936,4.829376854599406

108916,2,079073463X,"""Ladyhawke"" is one of those water cooler conversation movies.  It is always brought up as the film everyone has heard of, but rarely has been seen - and those that have seen it, worship the ground it steps on.  Recently, ""Ladyhawke"" came across my player, and the opportunity to view this romantic fantasy was presented.  Being an enormous fan of both ""The Princess Bride"", ""Willow"", and any of the reincarnations of ""Robin Hood"", I was eager to add another title to the cannon.  I wanted to be that guy that stood around the water cooler mentioning ""Ladyhawke"" to the utter confusion of my coworkers.  Alas, my dreams were not that of Navarre or Isabeau, instead they were shattered as soon as the 2+ hours were completed.  One can argue that this is a creative film; one could argue that the attraction between Hauer and Pfiffer was pure uncut chemistry, and one could argue that this is one of those forgotten classics that needs to be remembered.  Disappointingly, that is not my reaction to this Richard Donner helmed behemoth.  From a disastrous score (yep, jumping on that bandwagon) to cardboard acting to a underdeveloped plot, ""Ladyhawke"" failed to be anything more than just your average fantasy film.

As the anticipation of angry faces on this review is realized, let me stress my points.  ""Ladyhawke"" had quite a bit of potential.  The idea was in place, the actors may have been able to handle their respective roles (at least Broderick could), and the director was the director of ""Superman"".  How could this project fail?  At the beginning, there are no problems.  Our introduction to Phillipe aka ""the Mouse"" felt genuine and unique.  His escape from prison gave us a deeper insight to his character, his abilities, and his child-like motives.  The opening scene felt like it was going to set the tone for the remainder of the film, and for the brief 15-minutes of Phillipe's escape, the level of enjoyment was up.  Then, we are full-throttled into the world of Navarre, and our dynamic changes.  This becomes less of a film about Phillipe, whom I was rooting for, but instead a substandard story about two star-crossed lovers that by magic cannot be together.  Not only does our dynamic change (less Phillipe more quiet stares and gruff Hauer), but our story devolves into whatever Donner feels like throwing in on that day of shooting.  Never are we introduced to magic within the world, but suddenly we are to believe that this mutation is plausible.  There is realization that we are focusing on these two particular individuals, but we have no control group to experience the day-to-day of this world.  Then, more intermediate characters are brought forward to build excitement, when honestly, the just build confusion.  Question arise like was Cezar (Alfred Molina!) necessary, was John Wood as evil as predicted as the Bishop (need more!), and where does Imperius fit within everything.  ""Ladyhawke"" felt like Donner wanted sweeping landscapes, star-crossed lovers, and an epic church battle, but cared nothing for what fell in between.

With a lacking structure, we are forced to plop ourselves down and watch Hauer and Pfiffer carry this film - which is the bigger tragedy of this film because neither understand their roles not provide us with any definition.  Isabeau, the less developed of the two, begins with mere stares, being more mysterious then passionate, and then, as we get closer to the finale, Donner makes us question her love for Hauer - which undermines this entire film.  It makes us think that this is not eternal love, but merely a difficult circumstance.  Hauer, more muscle than mind, fights his way through every battle using a sword the size of Phillipe.  He is the most grounded of our group, and seems to be fighting more for their love than Pfiffer, but one needs to question when this epic battle didn't happen earlier.  Why was Phillipe needed to spark this journey?  If the love was that powerful, wouldn't Hauer have tried to meet with Imperius prior, fought the Bishop himself, and perhaps won his love himself?  This piece just didn't fit - their characters wanted it, but why couldn't they do it?

Finally, the music is horrible.  Yes, the 80s were a time of synthesizers and imagination, but it just didn't fit with this genre of film.  No matter how you put it, the music ruins the scenes in which we feel like the guards are going to break out in dance or have huge sunglasses.  Donner failed in the world of sound for this film, and merely for that - I can see why ""Ladyhawke"" hasn't taken off further.

FILM:  This film was flimsy.  The story wasn't structurally sound, the support (aka the actors) didn't know who their characters were, and the only shine in this darkened tunnel was Matthew Broderick, who charmed his way out of every predicament possible.  This is tough film to rewatch and even a tougher challenge to enjoy.

VISUAL:  The special effects were pure 80s, one cannot fault highly for that.  Yet this transfer was horrible.  It was like a VHS copy onto DVD.  Warner has not updated this disc since DVDs were first introduced, and that is sad.

SOUND:  One must applaud the genius who decided that synthesizers were a key element to period fantasy films.  I have never heard anything quite like this before, and I don't think I will again.  ""Ladyhawke"" is ruined, no matter what you say, due to the sound chosen to be our ""Hero's March"".

EXTRAS:  Staying true to the idea that nothing has changed since DVDs were first introduced, the extras contained are bios of the actors (done in page format - not video), a diary of some of the key scenes (again page format), suggestions of other films, and finally, the quintessential trailer.  Nothing else.  I am not an audio commentary snob, but Donner's words - even Hauer's gruff voice would have added to this disc immensely.

Overall, not impressed.  I began this film with hopes to discover a new fantasy to introduce to friends and be that guy around the water cooler.  ""Ladyhawke"" is not that film.  I believe it has been unjustly pushed into a cult category due to the popularity of its actors and possibly director.  The acting is below par, the soundtrack is hilarious, and the story is as ramshackled as this disc.  It is not a film to talk about, not a film to watch, nor a film to enjoy.  This was a disappointment - I can applaud Matthew Broderick for not forcing me to throw the disc out after the first hour, but other than that it failed.  ""Ladyhawke"" should be left in the darkened backlist of the local video store for years to come, only to be seen by some unsuspecting person hoping for the same quest I envisioned, but being disgusted again and again and again.

Why is this movie being IGNORED by the studios?  Just about every other movie - including the truly horrendous that don't deserve it - have gotten a remastered special edition of some sort by now.  LadyHawke truly DOES deserve better treatment.  People have requested it.  And I think we're getting to the point of demanding it.  Remastered picture and sound, please.  At the very least a new music score to replace the godawful original APP one (and yes, I thought it horrible back in the day, too, with the exception of the love theme).  The movie Legend has been released with an alternate music score, so it CAN be done.  Why are the fans being ignored?  Just the sheer number of people I see online using the screen name ""LadyHawke"" is evidence of this film's tremendous following.  So I'm completely baffled as to why this movie is being left to fall into obscurity.  It deserves better, and so do we.",1242604800,3,1181,4.535545023696683

I, and everyone I saw the film with when it was first released, thought the soundtrack was horrible back then as well (not cutting-edge, but something that should have been cut (silence would have been preferable to this lousy A.P.P. refuse)).

One of my favorite things about this film is that it is a good 'family film' in that it is enjoyable for everyone, not too scary for the kiddies, and doesn't require that adults remove their brain for viewing or adopt an 'Adam Sandler' or 'Three Stooges' level of humor (as most 'family films' seem to do)

Is there any chance this gem will receive a 25th anniversary special treatment? I, and a lot of others would line up for it. Warner? Are you listening? Even 'Legend' got an 'Ultimate Edition' and it isn't half the film this is.",1239580800,3,890,4.698717948717949
108939,4,079073463X,"Ladyhawke, a classic and one of my all time favorites, was quite a disappointment after seeing it again recently. A young thief escapes from the dungeons of a city only to be saved from the clutches of the city guard by a mysterious warrior accompanied by a hawk. At night, however, he finds himself in the company of a beautiful lady and a mysterious wolf... The story, coincidently, unfolds in Aquila (where the earthquake recently struck) during the Middle Ages.
In short, this is not the movie I remember from my childhood. Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeifer, and Matthew Broderick brought back memories, though it might have been better to avoid viewing the film again and instead holding on to those cherished childhood memories.
The music is simply awful, the acting is horrid, and the dialogues are terrible (a B-movie by all standards), though the story is very good and it makes up, to a certain extent, for the film's setbacks. 3.5 Stars",1239235200,,944,4.833333333333333
108940,4,079073463X,"As a kid in the 1980s I watched this film on TV. I remember loving the movie because it had an awesome battle with knights at the end and the Bishop was the bad guy (which at the time blew my mind because I was a by the book Catholic schoolboy).

I'll be honest, after Peter Jackson and others have re-invented the look and scale of the fantasy genre on film over the past ten years, Ladyhawke doesn't hold up as well as it did through my rose-colored glasses of nostalgia. If you've never seen the film before, you'll likely be sorely disappointed by the film's faults.

However, any fan of the 80s and/or fantasy films will likely overlook those same faults and should get a kick out of the awesomely cheesy 80s score by The Alan Parson's Project, Matthew Broderick's performance as basically Ferris Bueller in medieval France, Rutger Hauer as a lovelorn black knight out for revenge, and the unbelievably gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer as the titular character.

Also, anyone with younger children into fantasy or castles and knights can feel safe sharing this film with their seven-year-old as the violence is minimal and not at all graphic.

As for the DVD itself--the disc is double sided (always a minus in my book) with both full & widescreen versions. The special features are minimal and a bit misleading. There are no deleted scenes or commentaries or making of featurettes. There are, however, TEXT descriptions of several aspects of the film, but who wants to read a DVD? If you buy LADYHAWKE, buy it for the memories or to make new memories with the young fantasy fan in your life.",1238371200,,1591,4.671428571428572
108941,5,079073463X,"First of all, Rutger Hauer automatically makes any movie gain a star, so I guess that makes this a six star review? At any rate, this a film from the 80's that lots of people liked to call mediocre because it has Matthew Broderick being his usual self, it's directed by the director of Superman and The Goonies, and it has a rockin' 80's soundtrack that's hecka catchy.

I liked ""liked"" because I think like me, plenty of people are starting to realize (at long last) that this is probably the best film that Richard Donner ever made, and as a FILM, it is rather glorious. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

First of all, there's wonderful casting. Michelle Pfeiffer's role is rather understated, but that perhaps works to the film's strangely realistic style. Rutger Hauer is absolutely amazing as always, and yeah you believe this guy is a super-heroic, and yet very human knight, with everything that implies (honor, strength, courage, and a bit of a superior attitude and self-righteous tint that is very grounded as well). On the supporting side you've got a priest played by the guy who was the con man in Candleshoe (who plays a wonderful character here) and the guy who was Prof. Falken in War Games. Yeah, he's the Big Bad, but he's more off-kilter and driven to darkness than outright evil or maniacal (again, making the film a lot more realistic). And of course Matthew Broderick fights an urge to steal the show with his charm, and makes an extremely likable thief caught up in supernatural events.

The music is actually really great. It's a break from the super-realistic mood music in most films of this type, and does well to remind us this is ultimately an adventure story/fairy tale and not to be taken TOO seriously. You'll hate it the first time, and the second, and the third. And years later you'll start to really like after you've succumbed to it's catchiness. Oh and the real 80's rock music in the film is really good, if (again) understated.

To me the real star of the film though, is the AMAZING cinematography from the man who made The Last Emperor and Apocalypse Now epic. The countryside in this film is like a character unto itself and needs to be seen widescree on a huge screen to be fully appreciated. I think in the end this film is actually an unappreciated epic that just somehow didn't connect as well as it should have because the 80's had a bit too much awesome for everyone to appreciate (other awesome unappreciated family friendly epics include The Neverending Story and The Black Stallion Returns).

If you like fantasy films, Rutger Hauer, the 80's, great cinematography, and rock soundtracks that play while knights fight, this movie is one to own.",1237161600,,2695,4.689217758985201
108942,5,079073463X,"I found this to be one of more likable medieval (13th century) fantasy movies I've ever seen. It works because of the great mixture of action, beautiful photography, likable lead characters, humor, touching romance, suspense and no offensive language. Yes, here is an adult film that everyone can watch, and that' no clich.

Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer are handsome leads but Matthew Broderick, as ""Phillipe Gaston,"" is the star of the show. He provides the humor and is involved in almost every scene.

There is a lot of ""religion"" in here, both shown positively and negatively. Broderick's character acknowledges God and constantly talks to Him. Hauer refers to Him, too, but Broderick is the talker. However, here is yet another case of a French Catholic clergyman being the evil ""bad guy."" (Is one ever shown in a positive light?) John Wood effectively plays the nasty "" Bishop of Aqulia.""

This is a ""curse"" story about two humans who turn into hawk (Pfeiffer) and wolf (Hauer) by day/night never seeming to be human at the same time so they can be lovers and live happily ever after.

Overall, even though it's about 15 minutes too long, it is a solid film and one that has been enjoyed by everyone I know who has seen it. Now, if a sharp Blu-Ray could be made of this, I'd buy it all over again.",1236124800,,1309,4.653679653679654

108944,4,079073463X,"I wouldn't quite classify this one as a taut and rousing sword and sorcery adventure. Oh, but it does have sword fights and frantic chases and mad dashes and all the other tropes of action fantasy, but LADYHAWKE is more of a methodical action fantasy. It's got too much of a deliberate tone and pace for it to just grab you by your throat and get your juices going, nor will it inspire anyone to play sword fight with his homie. But it doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually entertaining, on a low adrenaline drip kind of way. Where it scores highly, of course, is on the romantic, heart-palpatatin' theme and on Matthew Broderick's performance.

LADYHAWKE's story has its base origins in the 13th century (or so indicates the DVD bonus feature), and who are we to argue? It just goes to show that, back in the Middle Ages, they weren't effing around when it came to unrequited love. The movie opens in the dank dungeons of Aquila, soon to be vacated by Phillipe Gaston a.k.a. the Mouse, a young lowly pickpocket who engages in one-way, tongue-in-cheeked conversations with God and who doesn't care to keep his appointment at the gallows.

Out in the woods, the Mouse scampers and skedaddles but still would've been quickly enough recaptured by Aquilan soldiers but for the intervention of the grim, black-clad knight Etienne Navarre. But the Mouse finds himself trading one captivity for another as he's now pressed into service playing squire and servant to Navarre and his horse Goliath and his hawk. For Mouse, things become even more strange. Night falls and the knight vanishes. But a beautiful woman, awkwardly named Isabeau, mysteriously appears. And somewhere in the distance a wolf gets to howlin'. This sets off Mouse's ""What's Up With That?"" radar.

Mouse, wanting no part of all this oddity, in time finds out that the moody Navarre and his lady love Isabeau near two years ago were cursed magically by the despicable Bishop of Aquila, who had desired Isabeau for his own and, upon learning that he couldn't have her, made a deal with the dark forces. By day, the knight is accompanied by his lady love but in the shape of a hawk. When the sun sets, the hawk reverts to its human form - but the knight then transforms into a black wolf. Etienne Navarre has waited and waited for that one day in which he may gain revenge, having given up hope that the curse may be lifted. And yet, with the clever Mouse at his side, that hope may yet quicken to reality. Oh, and there's also some sloppy-looking priest guy who helps out...

With all the Gregorian chanting and quite a few scenes taking place in a cathedral and the Bishop being the episcopal Big Bad, there's a decidedly churchy feel to this fantasy adventure. Doesn't make it good or bad, it's just there (okay, maybe it is a bit of a downer). The mood is consistently pensive and brooding, and maybe it's partly because the film wasn't shot in gloriously green New Zealand but rather in the crumbling castle landscapes of Italy under muted skies. It's almost as gritty-looking and low-key as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragonslayer/dp/B0000AUHOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragonslayer</a>&nbsp;(which, by the way, is also a good movie). For the romance freaks, LADYHAWKE comes with a pretty tragic love story. It's interesting to me that Rutger Hauer actually does a better job of pining than Michelle Pfeiffer. But Michelle Pfeiffer is so pretty that she can just sit there looking as she does, and she'll get the job done. I feel like I should swoon or catch the vapors or something.

There are some lighter moments, mostly brought about by Matthew Broderick, button-eyed and earnest sounding even though one can sense that playful, disingenuous tone lurking just underneath. Broderick has made a career out of this tone. The story is told thru the point-of-view of the very personable Mouse, and thru his eyes, the forlorn lovers achieve this detached, near-mythical aura. Mouse, scamp that he is, still knows better than to try to mess around with Isabeau. He knows he's way out of his league, caught like driftwood in the torrent of this towering, tragic love story. But is it wrong of me that I care more about Mouse than Navarre or Isabeau?

A few things that are wick-wick-wack: Firstly, it's not a big thing but I never could figure out whether Broderick was trying for a British accent or an American one from a 1930s screwball comedy. Second, I guess Navarre and Isabeau are both illiterates, else you'd think they'd be passing notes to each other, right? This next one bugs me quite a bit: After having politely addressed Isabeau as ""Milady"" all this time, Mouse picks a fine time to call her by her first name, right where the Bishop's hunter can conveniently hear it. And, lastly (and this is a gynormous beef for me), that hateful film score. Because I guess nothing says medieval adventure like electric guitars, keyboards, and synth. Can you say cheesy 1980s TV show theme songs?

The dvd offers the full screen version on one side and the widescreen presentation on the reverse side. The special features consist of a series of text commentaries on the following: cast & crew biographies, the story's source, Creating Aquila, Brother Imperius's Abbey, some ""fun facts"" about the animals involved, and on why Donner decided to clothe the good guy in black and the villain in white. And the theatrical trailer. If you're not disappointed about the paltry special features, then I won't be either (except that I'm disappointed).

I wouldn't say that LADYHAWKE is a stirring fantasy adventure; it's more a gritty, contemplative sort of medieval happily ever after. It's not up to the CG-backed standards of today's stuff, but the action is decent. Rutger Hauer has got that grim demeanor down pat, so he pulls off his fight scenes and then even has time to gaze wistfully at a bird and spout lovey-dovey stuff like: ""Did you know that hawks and wolves mate for life? The Bishop didn't even leave us that..."" But, more than anything, the film is carried by a very young, pre-Ferris Bueller Matthew Broderick who hams it up in a good way. And, of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is there, looking awfully pretty cloaked in her tragic love story.",1235520000,2,6269,4.857811038353601

108962,4,079073463X,"In every way but one this movie is superlative.  There are the stunning visuals of the setting.  Three medieval castles were used to create the town of Aquila where the evil Bishop rules. I used to wonder how the filmmakers got that magical lighting, but the special feature on the DVD advised that the filming was done in Italy...of course.

In this beautiful landscape, a pair of lovers struggle against the curse of the evil Bishop who lusted after the woman, aided by a petty thief and a drunken priest.  The action, the drama, the way the story unfolds grips the viewer as much on the tenth viewing as on the first.  Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful, angelic and fierce as the lady; Rutgar Hauer is dashing, noble and savage as the knight.

Only Matthew Broderick could be cute enough in the role of Phillippe the Mouse, a pickpocket who escapes from the dungeons of Aquila.  His constant chatter forms an irritating, mundane counterpoint to the magical reality in which the story plays out.  I take a star off for this part of the script--the screenplay uses Mouse as a way to ""tell but not show"" parts of the story.

The costumes and props are not designed to accurately portray any part of the Dark Ages but in every detail they contribute to this medieval story brought to life for the modern era. One of the most enduring visuals of this film is the knight on his beautiful black stallion Goliath. This horse, jet black with powerful floating gaits, was a real Friesian stallion named Othello.  I was disappointed that the special features of the DVD did not make any mention of him. As an enthusiast for the sport of dressage, I confess that one reason I bought this DVD is to be able to see this gorgeous horse perform.",1222560000,6,1729,4.566343042071197

Teen idol Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer (in a rare appearance as a good guy) and the always lovely Michelle Pfeiffer star in this expertly written fantasy from a story by Edward Khmara (who also co-wrote the script with Michael Thomas and Tom Mankewicz, who also served as consultant on this film and
""Superman: The Movie""). The music in the opening credits is amazing. I've always been a huge fan of period/fantasy films, plus the all-star cast (which includes Tony winner John Wood) and director (Donner) intrigued me to see it. Made in the same decade as the so-so ""Labyrinth"" (the story needed more work) and the even better fantasy-adventure-romance-comedy
""The Princess Bride,"" the film uses synthesized musical pieces which clash with the period setting, but it is no matter. In fact, the music makes the film even more enjoyable. Great job from everyone involved. My only minor complaint is that the climactic sword fight could have been better choreographed. Minor, but worth noting.

Ladyhawke has been a favorite movie of mine for many, many years. A friend and I caught it by chance in 1985 at a theatre where we had seen everything else before and I was hooked immediately!! Through the years since then, I found myself continually trying to get other people to see it, but it was only in 2004 that I was able to make a copy of it on VHS to show to friends that also came to enjoy the film.

When I first saw the rave comments listed in this review column, I finally felt vindicated for calling it one of my favorite movies all these years.

109030,3,079073463X,"Though I am not a great lover of fantasy films, I watched this movie after not seeing it in several years recently.  I try to watch movies that I have not seen in many years, thinking that maturity and experience since the last time I had seen it will change my perspective.  All in all, it was a good movie without being too overtly cheesy and hoaky like some modern fantasy movies are.  It was also in an age before special effects and animation had completely taken over, giving it a unique and somewhat antiquated charm.

A young Matthew Broderick plays a theif named Phillipe, who gets by on his wits and comic timing as a somewhat happy bumbling fool.  He escapes from the dungeons and certain death from Aquilla, a harsh town ruled by the iron fist of the Bishop.  Staggering through the world, homeless and desperate, Phillipe comes into the service of a lone warrior named Navarre, played to perfection by Rutger Hauer.  Cloaked in black astride a black horse, he has a hawk with him as his companion and guardian.  As night falls, Phillipe meets a mysterious woman named Isabeau whose protector is a black wolf.  The two are living under a curse cast by the Bishop.  Jealous of their love, he cursed the two to never assume human form together.  Isabeau lives as a hawk by day, Navarre as a wolf by night, the two never together.  With his help and the bumbling antics of a priest who betrayed him, Imperious, Phillipe helps Navarre break the curse and distroy the Bishop.

The love story is quite nice, actually, if not original.  Phillipe acts as their go between, as he tells each in human form of how the others longs for each other when they are living as poor dumb creatures.  He is the lover and poet for the both of them, living under the chaste, obsessive medevil love famous for the Middle Ages.  The religious aspect is also interesting, in that the Bishop did not overcome his human foibles enough to lead a truly asthetic life.  He is the evil force, drunk with power, making others bow before him as his word is absolute.

Critical words?  The music score.  I am not always looking to observe the music score in movies, but this wasn't appropriate.  Disco?  Probably the worst choice possible and underminded a lot of effort for effect.",1185235200,7,2260,4.555831265508685

music is wonderful, the actors/cast are great and well, you have to get

past the fact that Mathew Broderick was Ferris Beuler...but he has some

of the very best lines in the moview. I think when you consider this was

a very early period of Mathew's career, it was oustanding in this role.

When the movie became available to the public, it was on VHS and I had

to have a copy...it was $75.00. Easily the most I've ever spent on a

109056,4,079073463X,"Certain movies are instantly classics. Back when I first saw this movie at the theater I was fairly impressed but I thought Matthew Broderick was not cast right for it and the music was techy. Since then I honestly think the reason I thought that about Broderick was I associated him with Ferris Bueller to much, and I have learned to accept the music too. Even though Broderick is to well spoken for his part and sounds a bit like Ferris, the music is a bit techno-new age, and Pfeiffer makes a couple non-period language slips, it still is just beautiful. The camera work was exceptional and the director must have done a fine job with this wonderful story because along with the beauty of the camera work the acting, sets, and scenery are great.

I have probably seen every fantasy movie made in the last 40 years and this is one of the best. If you are a fan of well crafted fantasy movies like ""Princess Bride"" and ""Ever After"" I suggest you see this one. It has slipped by many since it was made so long ago. Typically most people that did not originally see this at the theater or on TV catch it by word of mouth. I highly recommend it. If you haven't seen this in awhile I think you will enjoy seeing it again and you first time viewers are in for a treat from a young Matthew Broderick, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Rutger Hauer.

The plot is basicly a knight and a lady are banished because of their love for each other when the bishop had designs on the lady himself. The good news is the two lovers are together. The bad news is one is always an animal thanks to a curse by the bishop. One is a hawk by day and the other a wolf by night. In walks a petty thief played by Broderick that wiles them, and then is actually touched by their trajedy. He comes up with a plan to make things right. Only one disappointment, this DVD is your normal cheap cardboard box with no extras on the DVD.

109057,4,079073463X,"I have this movie on DVD and watch it periodically.

It is a compelling question; why does this 1980's movie make you want to watch it over and over?

There is no doubt that the story is compelling and convincing.  I like Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick alot.  Michelle Pfeiffer isn't bad, isn't great.  Leo Kern and John Wood complete the central cast and are all very believable.

Others have commented on the movie music as just wrong.

One reviewer commented on the anachronistic phrasing.

I believe it is the plot and the way it is played by Hauer and Pfeiffer of non-consummated love that keeps watchers coming back.  It is a compelling story.  There are several factors that keep this story from being a great movie.  There is the use of the film technique that made it dark and grainy at times.  Probably the music.  But what jars me the most is the anachronistic language.  Phillippe is simply too well spoken to have been a street urchin all his life.  I also recall Michelle Pfeiffer's ""Oh, damn!"" when she is distracted by The Mouse as she feverishly--as a human--tries to catch a rabbit and fails.  Her ""Oh, damn"" had more the intonation of '80's girl who cannot find hairbrush than medievel damsel in starvation distress.  Hauer really stayed in character and period the best here.

Bottom line--watch it.  With all of it's imperfections, this is a movie that moves you to care about the characters and you will be taken up in to their fantasy dilemma.",1151366400,3,1470,4.6498054474708175

While from sundown to sunrise, her beloved Navarre (Rutger Hauer) is a wolf.  Into their lives comes Philippe ""the Mouse"" Gaston (Matthew Broderick), a petty thief and escape artist.  Philippe has just escaped from prison and is being chased by the guard.  The same guard who Navarre used to be the Captain of the Guard.

Navarre has returned to France to kill the Bishop (John Woods) who cursed Isabeau and himself.  But first he must get through is old command.  In the process, both he and hawk Isabeau are shot with arrows.  Philippe takes Isabeau to the priest Imperius (Leo McKern).  Imperius is the priest that betrayed the couple to the Bishop.  Imerius has been guilt ridden for this and has found a way for the couple to break the curse but Navarre is blinded by his rage and will not listen.

Everything comes to a head at the Bishop's abbey.  Navarre confronts the Bishop but cannot kill him because of his love for Isabeau.  Then something fantastic happens, a day with night and a night without day or as we know it, an eclipse.  This allows both to appear in human form and confront the bishop.

This was an early film in each of the stars careers.  Each had their breakthrough film and were looking for the next big film.  They achieved this with three great performances.  This film did not rely on a special effects but use simple dissolves and lighting.

The only negative that I have with the DVD is that the musical score blares out and if you have the sound right for the music, you can't hear the actor.  If you have the sound right to hear the actors, the music will blast you out of your seat.  But this is more a warning and not a complaint.

The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue.  Show 'em how it's done, Leo.

Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited.  Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief.  Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then.  Rutger Hauer is just plain bad.

In defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations.

109071,5,079073463X,"LadyHawke is a simply beautiful, enchanting and most romantic medievil tale of two lovers doomed by the darkened curse of an evil and jealous bishop. By day, the delicately exquisite Lady Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) is transformed into a graceful Hawke, while her beloved and heroic Captain Ettienne Navarre(Rutger Hauer), takes on the form of a black Wolf through the night. Never the twain shall meet in human form, destined to never consummate their love. The devoted lovers can do nought but roam hopelessly, though never parted, waiting for a miracle and divine sign that the curse may somehow be broken. It comes in the form of a recently escaped prisoner, the quick and crafty theif, Phillipe 'The Mouse' Gaston(Matthew Broderick). Who, saved by Navarre and later assisted by a rougly eccentric and exiled Monk (played by veteran actor Leo Mckern), guides them to the key which will undo the curse and re-unite them, helping to ward off their attackers and enemies along the way.
LadyHawke handles the medievil genre with class and wit. Artfully directed and photogaphed, it is fast paced with plenty of action and thrills, whilst always maintaining the mystical and mythical poetry of the story beautifully. The script balances both modern comical elements with classic romance and imagery in a way which keeps the viewer both entertained and enchanted. Whilst the tragic dilemma of Navarre and Isabeau, along with their profound love for each other, is captured and presented in a way which is heartfelt and sublimely moving.
The actors are most suitably cast for this film. Pfeiffer; with her delicate, stunning classic beauty and refined grace, is perfect as Isabeau. And the lessor known 'Hauer', makes a most dashing and teutonically hansome Captain Navarre. Indeed an impressive and imposing, almost futuristic figure, all in black aloft his majestic, powerfull horse, 'Golaith'. But the film would not have been as successful or enjoyable without the delightful performance of Broderick as 'Phillipe'; who's character provides a comic lightness and suitable contrast within the story, that is cleverly subtle and droll. Added to this is an impressive supporting cast of very high class and calibre; including 'John Wood', who is just wonderful as the unsettlingly sinister and powerful Bishop.
The film, with its magical premise of the lovers' spirits being trapped within that of a beautiful bird of prey and majestic wild beast, has a very mystical feel and is quite visually stunning. The romantic and metaphorical imagery of this period and genre has always captivated me, I must admit. Part fairy tale/fantasy and romantic legend and part action packed adventure, it has all the ingredients to make it an enduring favourite and classic piece of cinema. My only criticism is that of the quite '80's' musical score which doesn't really capture the mood or emotion of the film. It is not one I would have chosen and does seem quite out of place. I realize that they chose it in order to give the story a more modern 'Hollywood action' kind of feel and undertone, but it didn't really work for me. I would have prefered some haunting celtish pipes and drums or suitable classical style. Apart from that, LadyHawke is a very well crafted, visually beautiful and riveting movie, perfect for watching on a rainy sunday.",1146268800,4,3332,5.0710382513661205

- Rutger Hauer (the knight, of course),
- Michelle Pfeiffer (the other half of the cursed couple),
- Matthew Broderick (knave with a heart of gold), and
- Leo Kern (aging hermit, in on the terrible secret).

Saying much more would mean saying too much, but it has the fairy tale ending you'd hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs.

One thing about this movie (or maybe the DVD transfer) truly annoys me, however. Someone messed with the colors, like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters, and hasn't learned how garish they can be. To whoever did it: please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time.

Outside of that, it's a safe, entertaining movie. Enjoy!

The theme of star-crossed lovers is as old as story telling, but it never goes away because it just keeps on working.  The device used by this story to tell the tale is mystically enchanting.  The drama of the rising and setting sun becomes a powerful metaphor.

These days there are too many movies that fall flat because underlying the superficialities of special effects, there is: Nothing.  These films are quickly and readily assigned to the dust bin of your consciousness.

Enter Leo Mckern as the drunken priest Father Imperious who needs to atone for his past sins, and a boy Phillipe Gaston, the Mouse, acted to perfection by a young Mathew Broderick in one of his earlier roles.
The plot is simple and exciting; Navarre wants revenge on the Bishop for the curse he has laid upon him and his one true love, but the only way to get to the Bishop is by attacking his fortress and that is a suicide mission.
Enter the Mouse who is the only person to get out of the Dungeon's of Aquila alive and it is through the Mouse that Navarre can extract his revenge.
There is a lot of action, good acting overall, a lot of humour, and some wonderfully touching scenes that don't get over cheesy which is saying something.
Look out for Alfred Molina as the Wolf Hunter Cezar, it's one of his earlier roles.

I really love this film.  It's one of my top favorite fantasy films of all time.  It's also a childhood favorite; they used to show it on the ol' family channel right after Neverending Story.  Nostalgia aside, this is a wonderfully made film.  You have a traditional medieval story about starcrossed lovers, epic battles, beautiful locales, and humor along the way.  I especially liked The Mouse's misconceptions about God and towards the end of the film, he finally has an idea of what's going on.  The acting is quite good, especially considering the main three stars were up-and-coming; Broderick just got off of doing WarGames and Ferris Fueller before taking the role.  Hard to believe that Rutger Hauer wasn't the original choice for Navarre (it was reported that Kurt Russell was originally selected to play the part) because he makes the role all his own.  It's also nice to see him play a hero role, too; for a long time I thought of him as the psychotic replicant from Blade Runner.  Of course, Pfeiffer is excellent as she is beautiful, too.
Richard Donner, best known for helming the Lethal Weapon series, directed and co-produced.  His wife, Lauren Shuler, produced the film.  His directing style here is actually different from most of his films, allowing the beauty of the old landscapes and the fight scenes to be portrayed properly.  The screenplay is top-notch, which is no surprise since one of the writers wrote Enemy Mine and the other contributed to the Superman series.
Probably the only quarrel I have with it is the music score by Andrew Powell (one of the members of the Alan Parsons Project).  I actually liked the score, especially with its jaunting theme, but one critic described it as ""disco-medieval.""  I can't agree more.  It screams the 80s so well that a contemporary score set to a medieval picture seems very inappropriate.  Still, a good score despite what people say.

Ladyhawke follows Phillipe Gaston (Matthew Broderick), a petty thief in Medieval Europe known as ""the Mouse.""  Soon after escape the dungeons of Aquila and the hangman's noose, he accidentally becomes entwined with the quest a pair of star-crossed lovers Attiene Navarre and Lady Isabeau (Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfiefer) to break themselves of a curse put on them by the corrupt and evil bishop of Aquila (John Wood).
About the Movie
Ladyhawke stands as one of my favorite movies. I tend to go towards fantasy as a matter of course, but this movie has strong 'chick-flick' elements in it.
But I don't care. Matthew Broderick is delightful and a little silly as 'the Mouse,' showing in this film, exactly why he's endured as an actor for all these years. Rutger Hauer, an actor I've always liked, did a great job as well. His portrayal of the cursed and grieving Navarre is believable in its intensity.  And of course, Michelle Pfiefer, while not a scene stealer, certainly is nice to watch.
The story itself is the classic tale of star-crossed lovers (right down to the enchantment that keeps them apart), but unlike Shakespeare's classic play, the lovers get to have each other in the end. This is a true epic fantasy, with a good many original elements.
The first thing most people mention when they see this movie is that the musical score is out of place. I have to admit that that analysis is right on. The musical scoring for this movie was done by 80's band ""The Alan Parsons Project."" While generally, I have liked their music, the disco-pop electronica that runs through a good portion of the movie and many of the action scenes is out of place and poorly chosen. In 1985, this was cutting edge stuff, but now nearly 20 years later, it is hopelessly dated and out of place for a pure medieval fantasy film. Fantasy movies should have a fantasy score.
It would be wonderful if a director's cut were released with a revamped musical score. Such a project would turn what is at this point a very fine movie (with hokey music) into a stronger and better lasting film.
But for all the downsides of the musical score, it's the story itself that steals the show. There's something attractive and heartwarming about it and its characters. As a result, they hold your attention easily and through them, the grand finale truly manages to make the viewer grin with satisfaction.
About the DVD:
This DVD release of Ladyhawke is nothing special as far as DVD releases go.  It comes on a double sided DVD in both Letterbox and Fullscreen versions in a cardboard snap case.  The movie is translated into French and Spanish, and comes with English, French, and Spanish subtitles. There are a few bonus features as well, but all of the textual variety. More on that below.
The video quality of this DVD is not much better than you'd find on a video cassette; something that's somewhat disappointing given the DVD format's high capacity for quality images.  The heavy film grain that showed up in some scenes is not something I like to see on DVD. It's a real shame, because the lack of quality really shows on a high resolution screens. Likewise, the sound is about average as well.
This DVD does have a few bonus features that come in the format of a few screens of trivia about the making of the film and various aspects of the cast and production.  All are interesting reading but aren't anything more than interesting trivia.  The only actual video portion of the bonus features is the orginal theatrical trailer for the movie.
Bottom line here is that this is a mediocre DVD release.  The bad film transfer really is noticable on high-res screens, and there really isn't much in terms of extra features and material. I give it 4 stars.  A fine movie that worth seeing, on a mediocre and disappointing DVD release.",1071100800,214,3823,4.6855439642324885

The romance at the heart of the story is that of 2 lovers upon whom a curse has been put, the girl becomes a hawk with every sunrise, and her lover turns into a wolf as the sun sets, so they're never humans at the same time.

109171,5,079073463X,"This is one of those ""guilty pleasures"" people talk about. Despite its many flaws, it still stands out as one of my favorite movies -- I watch it more often than I will admit. Yes, the story can get stilted. Yes, it's more full of authenticity errors than your average LARP. Yes, the soundtrack's electric guitars and synth sound ridiculous. Yes, the script forces the actors to say really stupid things. But you know what? It's still a great movie, in the tradition of the greatest medieval romances.
It borrows shamelessly from many sources, ending up with a nearly archetypical story of a lady in love with a knight and a dreadful, awe-inspiringly-unpleasant curse preventing them from being together. Rutger Hauer makes his knight, Nevarre, brim with barely-controlled fury, tension, violence, and desire the entire movie. Michelle Pfeiffer's Isabeau is delicate and airy, but capable and somewhat irritated with (and resigned to) Nevarre's impulsiveness and violence, a welcome change from standard damsels-in-distress. Broderick's ""Mouse"" is a false note -- it's like Ferris Bueller got set down in 13th-century France. The whole ""talking to yourself to illustrate motive"" thing is annoying. But he does provide some welcome humor (the ""she flew away, Your Honor!"" line is one of the best in the movie). The sets are excellent, the scenery is incredible, the costumes are all right (with the exception of Isabeau's hair, which looks just flat-out WRONG the whole way through the movie, and Nevarre, whose black leather is totally cool, even makes squeaky leather noises when he walks), and I just love the horse, who is a character in his own right.
There are very few goodies on the DVD, but the few there are, and the widescreening, make it worthwhile as a purchase. I'm definitely glad I got mine. Incidentally, while it has no real sex or graphic violence, I don't think it'd be great for little kids to see due to some pretty mature ideas in it, including very naughty priests.",1023321600,2,1988,4.972972972972973

The music is a bit different than some might expect and thus it might throw you off. But this movie has a great tragic storyline and a great message about the power of Good. Suffice it to say, the movie ends with a happy note. This turned out to be somewhat of a chick flick that my wife liked because the basic premise of the movie is one big love story. Thus, men and women alike should enjoy this one.

Update:
> I'm okay with the 70's style soundtrack, though it does throw a person off a bit

+ Matthew Brodrick is a bumbling criminal, where his physical humor and expressions remind me of the old Jerry Lewis (accidental physical comedy) with Jackie Chan (intentional physical comedy)

+ Michelle Pfieffer = It's Michelle and I first watched this when I was in high school. Hubba-hubba! Nuff said.

+ Rutger Hauer = the brooding tragic hero...

I can still go back to this movie and it's a love story that pulls you in. Since it takes place in medieval times, it feels like a fantasy story...and there are supernatural elements that make it so. Totally worth watching. . .some will want to own it.",1013817600,,1131,4.4396135265700485
109185,5,079073463X,"Unlike Lord of the Rings' tediously disjointed and noisy action sequences written solely for the sake of action, Ladyhawke tells a story that is both a captivating and poignant romance as well as an action adventure. The other reviews are excellent and accurate, except that I rather liked the music. I rarely like even a good movie well enough to want to see it twice, but Ladyhawke is is one of those exceptions. I ordered a DVD after viewing the VHS version to avoid the deterioration problem. I would advise viewing the movie with the brightness turned up because it is somewhat too dark in places. Also, I enjoyed it more with the written dialog, as I found the softer passages a bit difficult to hear.

The story is a creative and unique work of cinematic art and will hold your interest from beginning to end. I'm probably not as sophisticated as some of the more astute viewers because it is one of my favorite movies. To me the casting, filming, script, and acting are first rate.  The story is an adaptation of an actual old medieval legend. This movie is good when viewed alone, but it is even better when shared with a loved one.

109187,5,079073463X,"Love, jealousy and magic-- a potent combination in anybody's book; and when you weave these elements together into a story of two medieval lovers (the likes of which Shakespeare could not have penned better), destined to be forever together yet ever apart, cursed by a jealous and powerful man, the result is a romance/adventure that evokes a sense of chivalry and passion, delivered here in the transporting drama ""Ladyhawke,"" directed by Richard Donner.  Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer star as the lovers, Etienne Navarre and Isabeau Dante, victims of the wanton desires of a Bishop (John Wood), who covets Isabeau for himself.  And if he cannot have her, the Bishop decrees that no man shall, and casts a spell upon them which transforms them at every sunrise and sunset, Navarre destined to be a man by day, but a wolf by night; Isabeau, by night a woman, but during the daylight taking the form of a hawk.  Unable to break the curse, they are able to glimpse one another as they really are only during the fleeting moments of their transition, and so they live-- traveling the countryside always together yet apart, searching for a way to lift the spell and become whole again.
 Hopeless as it all seems, they go on; and one day a young man enters their lives, a petty thief named Phillipe Gaston (Matthew Broderick), also known as ""The Mouse,"" who through a twist of fate just may become their salvation.  Joining them on their journey, Phillipe is able to bring Navarre and Isabeau, if not comfort, at least hope.  Hope for a better tomorrow, when at last they may truly be together.
 Romantic to the max and in every sense of the word, Donner presents this fanciful tale beautifully, and in a way that makes it engaging and timeless.  This story is a vision realized, one that will surely touch the romantic in even the most jaded of individuals, because everyone has known this kind of love and longing, if not in reality, then at least in the realm of the imagination.  And those who have ever suffered loss or have known sorrow will be especially moved by it.  Drawing upon his own artistic wherewithal, Donner has crafted a film with universal appeal, tempering the romance with just enough humor to offset the drama, while blending it with a dash of action, mystery and suspense that keeps a thread of tension alive from beginning to end.  It helps, of course, that beyond Donner's consummate skill as a storyteller he had a terrific cast with which to work, and with whom he was able to conjure and cast a spell of his own.
 There is but one word to describe Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Isabeau, and that is ""Exquisite.""  Of beauty, grace, poise and charm; all of the above.  She embodies all of these qualities and more in Isabeau, giving a sensuous and alluring performance that should have earned her resounding acclaim.  Why it did not is anyone's guess.  One possibility is that it had to do with the decade in which this film was made (it was released in 1985), born as it was in the middle of an era dominated by action movies and teen angst.  Given the sensibilities of today's audiences, however, who seem to be embracing the more imaginative offerings like ""Harry Potter,"" ""Lord of the Rings"" and the off-beat fairy tale, ""Shrek,"" and in light of the unprecedented success of ""Titanic,"" I feel an argument could be made that this film was some fifteen years or so ahead of it's time.  If released today, chances are it would enjoy a significantly greater success.  Indeed, it may yet find new life on video/DVD, conducive as it is to the tastes of viewers today.
 This is certainly one of Rutger Hauer's most memorable roles, and he is perfectly cast as the dashing soldier, Navarre.  Heroic and romantic, this is a character not unlike others he's done (he did a variation of Navarre this same year in ""Flesh and Blood""), but this is the definitive portrayal.  It's refreshing to see him in a role like this, as he tends to gravitate toward characters with a darker side, villains like John in ""The Hitcher,"" or the anti-hero, Roy, in ""Blade Runner.""  Here, astride his horse and wielding a sword apparently wrought from the same steel as Excalibur, he cuts quite a bold figure, enhanced by the depth of his eyes and a determined attitude, especially in the final scene in which he at last confronts his nemesis.  And there's a definite chemistry between Hauer and Pfeiffer that makes this story all the more enticing.
 As Phillipe, Matthew Broderick gives an agreeable performance, creating a character who is not only ingratiating, but who serves as a sort of conduit, moving the story along while offering some fresh perspectives on the situation at hand along the way.  Broderick lends something of a contemporary sensibility to The Mouse, who is reminiscent of C-3PO in ""Star Wars,"" as he adopts a rather wry and amusingly stoic attitude that makes his bemused soliloquies especially engaging.  It's a solid performance, but one for which Broderick-- like Pfeiffer and Hauer-- has never received proper acknowledgement.
 The supporting cast includes Leo McKern (Imperius), Ken Hutchison (Marquet), Alfred Molina (Cezar) and Giancarlo Prete (Fornac).  Encompassing a number of genres, from romance to fantasy/drama to action/adventure, ""Ladyhawke"" is an ambitious, entertaining film that has yet to find it's audience-- or perhaps it's the other way around; because it's available and just waiting to be spirited away into living rooms and video/DVD players everywhere.  Which is exactly what it will do to those lucky enough to connect with it, because this is one that will sweep you away to another time and another place, beyond the threshold of the here and now and into that land of enchantment, wherever it may be.  It's the magic of the movies.",1007942400,4,5790,4.79476861167002

Really it just adds to the charm, cause they don't do movies like this anymore in the new century. So it's kind of an escape back to childhood for me.",1004745600,,480,4.285714285714286
109189,4,079073463X,"Ladyhawke stands as one of my favorite movies.  I tend to go towards fantasy as a matter of course, but this movie has strong 'chick-flick' elements in it.
But I don't care.  Matthew Broderick is delightful as 'the mouse' and Rutger Howard outdid himself in this one.  The story itself is the classic tale of Star-crossed lovers (right down to the enchantment that keeps them apart), but unlike Shakespeare, the lovers get to have each other in the end. This is a true epic fantasy, with a good many original elements.
The first thing most people mention when they see this movie is that the musical score is out of place.  I have to admit that that analysis is right on.  The musical scoring for this movie was done by 80's band ""The Alan Parsons Project.""  While generally, I have liked their music, the disco-pop electronica that runs through the first third of the movie and many of the action scenes is out of place and poorly chosen.
That said, there are points when the music is subtle and well placed.  It would be wonderful if a director's cut would be made of this movie and the music replaced.  Such a project would turn what is at this point a very fine movie (with hokey music) into a classic.
I give it a 4. Though I've watched this movie about 10 times, the music really gets on my nerves.  But that's just me.  Give it a look, it's definately worth it.",1004054400,3,1368,4.414342629482071

If there's a complaint to be made about this film, it's the music.  The Alan Parsons Project were a fine band, but the electronic 80's pop soundtrack detracts too much from the film and dates it as well.

Because of a curse by the evil Bishop of Aquila (John Wood), by day Isabeau is a hawk, by night Navarre is a wolf. Navarre vows to break the curse by getting into the Bishop's stronghold, by using the help of Philippe. A truly touching story which is my family's all time favorite. The acting is perfect, the director did a wonderful job, and Alan Parson's music in it is terrific! This is a must see!

The story, based upon a Medieval legend of a pair of cursed lovers-a knight who is a wolf by night, and a lady who is a hawk by day-is gorgeous to watch, not just for the fine acting, but for the wonderful Italian countryside. Rutger Hauer is a starwart as Etienne of Navarre, a man who can fight off battlions of the Bishop's Guards one moment, just ache so heartbreakingly for his lost love the next. Michelle Pfieffer, as Isabeau of Anjou, comports herself with touching vunerability, yet with a strength which sometimes takes ones breath away. And then, as now, hers is an etherial beauty for which men would go to war. Even Matthew Broderick, as the comedy relief thief Phillipe the Mouse, can bring a smile or a tear with equal ease. His charector oftentimes seems on the edge of madness as he slowly realizes what he had gotten himself into by escaping the dungeons of Aquiela. And the last scenes, with the battle in the Church, and the final confrontation with the evil bishop (and gentlemen, upon getting married, how would you like to see Michelle Pfieffer down the aisle?) is the big payoff. I wish this one had a sequal, if only so that I could see what happened next to these wonderful charectors.

109212,4,079073463X,"My favorite love story/scifi/fantasy movie. Pfeiffer and Hauer respectively play Isabeau and Navarre convincingly as lovers who suffer the anguish of cursed separation.
Watch Hauer's face as he listens to Gaston(Broderick) speak of Isabeau---you will be captivated by his expressions of powerful disdain and bitterness changing to expressions of delight and longing.
Feel the gravity of tragedy when Gaston asks Isabeau who she is and she answers ""I am Sorrow."" Pfeiffer is perfect as Isabeau and Rutger Hauer as Navarre. I still swoom when I see his riding scenes on that magnificent black stallion...in those black nobleman's riding clothes on a lean and muscular body. Whew! Someone let some air in, please! (And I don't usually like the blonde and tan type.)
The scene at dawn---for that fleeting moment when they are both human and they achingly reach out to touch hands...I could almost feel the ache too. Hauer's roar of frustration---whoah.
 And yes, the music can get strong and corny at times, but there are other moments when the disco medieval works out just fine.
 The fighting scenes are good, and Broderick sets off an element of humour well. The scene when the lovers confront the evil bishop are satisfying for an ending. And, honestly, the only thing that I DID NOT like about the movie was the very last scene---it could have been a little different. Here's why: Navarre holds Isabeau up in the air and twirls her around in the church hall while sunshine streams over them...Pfeiffer lifts her arms up like she's flying...Okay I could stomach that part, but the part where she cries out ""I love you"" over and over again. Puhleeeze! For me, this is the one lame scene and week cinematic treatment of the story.
Otherwise, aside from the last few seconds of that ending scene, the rest of the movie is strong and I just can't resist the whole effect it has on me. It's a special hybrid of fairytale/fantasy and romance.",985996800,,1936,4.863636363636363

You can hear horse galloping, draw bridge, and jungle sound from your surround channel. The only drawback is not enough bass. But the Dolby Digital sound is wonderful. No problem with the picture as well. Bright and clear. This movie is certainly the best movie for Richard Donner (as director), Michelle Pfeiffer (as the leading actress) and Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick(as the leading actors).

109233,4,079073463X,"An excellent telling of the classic tale of star-crossed love.  Rutger Hauer is excellent in his very subtle performance as Etienne Navarre, the once and future Captain of the Guard.  He is a man haunted and driven, but stoic beyond words.  Mathew Broderick is delightful as Phillip Gaston, 'The Mouse' who finds himself caught up in the web of mystery that surrounds Navarre.  Personally, I always found Michelle Pfeiffer's performance a little flat and unbelievable, but it may just be my preference.
The downside of this movie is that the soundtrack is horrid, there is no attention to any type of historical context (Where are they?  When are they?  Where did they get that horrid armor?) but it doesn't seem to matter much.
The upside is it is a wonderful tale, and has some of the best sword fighting ever.  As a professional stunt performer, swordfight choreographer, and a fencing coach, I must say that the battle between Navarre and Marquet in the cathedral at the end of the film is about the best I have ever seen, in terms of realism, as well as appropriateness to the characters and plot.  These two -hate- each other, and they fight tooth, fang, and claw knowing only one will survive.  This is not the `pretty' sword fighting of Princess Bride, but the gritty reality of edged combat.  Add in the element of them battling on horseback on the stone floor of the cathedral, and this is truly an amazing fight.
If you like films such as Highlander or Excalibur, you will like this film.  If you are really into this movie, check out the book, as the ending is different, and far more poignant...",973209600,5,1608,4.666666666666667

I won't write a summary of the plot, because several people have done so already, but if you like medieval romances, watch this movie. You will probably want to buy it.

While there has been criticism about the soundtrack, I can only say that your reaction to it will depend on your taste and how much a movie's soundtrack affects your feeling about the movie. While in some movies the soundtrack is very integral, I think in Ladyhawke the soundtrack is really not that important. I personally enjoy the music very much and I hadn't ever really thought about it--I think it fits an 80s movie and it's kind of interesting and different--however, I recently watched the movie with a friend who said the soundtrack was ""cheesy.""  Whether you like the soundtrack or not, the story is so compelling that it is doubtful the music will keep you from enjoying the film.  The story is based on an old legend about two lovers who have been cursed by an evil bishop so that the man, Navarre, is a wolf at night and the woman, Isabeau, is a hawk by day. The lovers' path crosses with that of a thief named Philippe ""the mouse"", played by Matthew Broderick.  Romance, action, adventure, and a little comedy ensues to bring you to a dramatic and heartwarming ending. The story itself is at once beautiful, dark, sad and uplifting, and it's definitely the kind of movie that captivates you in a way that will stay with you for a long time, perhaps forever! If you're particularly empathetic you will probably be brought to tears at some of the more poignant scenes.

109236,5,079073463X,"This is probably, of all my favorite 80s fantasy movies, the best of them all. This movie has everything: adventure, romance, tragedy, comedy, true love, evil, and redemption. This is a masterpiece. A true masterpiece.
A young thief named Phillipe Gaston ""the Mouse"" escapes from Aquila, the fortress-like city belonging to its corrupt Bishop. He roams along the countryside, until he runs into some of the men sent out to hunt for him. But a mysterious man, Captain Etienne Navarre, appears and rescues him. Navarre is a mysterious, lonely man whose only companion is a lovely hawk he has with him always, and who needs Phillipe's help.
That night, as they stay in a farmer's barn, Phillipe sees a wolf and a beautiful young woman outside--but the woman vanishes during the day, as Navarre vanishes during the night. Phillipe soon discovers the tragic reason why the two cannot be together: they are cursed--he is a wolf at night and she a hawk by day. As animals, neither is sentient, so they don't remember anything that the other says or does. Their only glimpses of each other are as they transform at the end and beginning of days.
This could have been very depressing, but Matthew Broderick's unusualy humor makes it funny at time. As a seemingly honorless young thief, Phillipe talks to God frequently and, as he learns to help others, becomes a better person. The big-brother-little-brother relationship that seems to form between him and Navarre is particularly endearing.
I fell in love with Rutger Hauer in this movie, as the stalwart, tragic knight Etienne Navarre. Hauer's rugged good looks are only a small part of his appeal--extremely expressive eyes and his quiet voice add to it. He's the knight every women dreams of. The part where he watches the wounded Isabeau plummet to the ground and murmurs, ""No..."", the part where he tenderly holds one of her dresses, and the scene where he and Isabeau have a brief glimpse of each other as humans are his finest moments.
Michelle Pfeiffer, whom I had only seen in ""Age of Innocence"" before, is perfect as the lovely lady Isabeau. Though she plays an innocent and sweet person, Pfeiffer shows that Isabeau is also a strong and brave one. Together, she and Hauer are so convincing that you'll find yourself with tears in your eyes.
Leo McKern is a very rough jewel in this movie. Playing the tormented old priest, Imperius, who committed a mortal sin by betraying the lovers, he is alternately amusing, haunted, and grim. Though definitely not as handsome as Hauer or Broderick, he is no less convincing and just as good an actor.
There's no nudity or gratuitous violence in this movie, although there IS violence. There is a bit of swearing (nothing worse than ""damn you to hell,"" meant literally) and references to a ""dark side"" bishop who is in love with Isabeau.
Although I do wonder: Evidently clothes vanish if Isabeau or Navarre transform while wearing them. Then how did Navarre manage to dress himself, scamper up a rock ledge, and fire his crossbow only seconds after sunset, if he woke up nude the day after? (Never mind me, I'm just nitpicking)
The characters are set in a land of lush fields, beautiful mountains, fortresses and ruined castles, forests and midnight thunderstorms. The costumes are beautiful and simple, from Imperius's rags to Navarre's black armor to the bishop's stark white robes.
Anyhow, this movie is a must see--it has something for everyone. You'll come away from it feeling a little richer in spirit.",970358400,4,3500,4.864321608040201
109257,5,079073463X,"It's hard to imagine a romantic adventure of this caliber being made today. In fact, it was somewhat anachronistic when it was made in the mid 1980s. But I wish that there were more movies this good being made today. I don't know how many times I've seen Ladyhawke but it's been quite a few, and I never seem to tire of it. In fact, although I already had it on videocassette, I bought the DVD version even before I had a DVD player because I din't want to take a chance that it would become unavailable. This movie is that good.
The title, LadyHawke, comes from the fact that the lady (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a hawk by day and a woman only at night as the result of a curse placed by a jealous bishop. Because of the curse, her lover (Rutger Hauer) is a wolf at night and a man by day. Thus, although the lover's are always together, they are also always apart. An old priest (Leo Kern) comes up with a plan to break the curse and enlists the help of a young thief (Matthew Broderick) in implementing it.

The high points in the film  include the quest to break the curse the bishop puts on Navarre and  Isabeau, and the fight scene with Navarre and the new captain of the guard  near the end of the film. Overall, the film has a great storyline that  should appeal to any sword and sorcery fan.
However, I did have a couple  of problems with the film. Matthew Broderick's character is slightly  annoying. I understand that he is suppossed to be comic relief, but do we  really need him talking to God every five minutes. Second, the soundtrack  just doesn't fit the style of the movie. I believe the movie should've had  a soundtrack similar in style that was used in the original  ""Highlander."" At least it would've brought a more serious tone to  the movie.
Lastly, for any Rutger Hauer fan out there, check out the  movie ""The Hitcher."" You just can't imagine how frightening this  movie is.",966556800,6,1077,4.541666666666667

I  always eager to learn some more from my fave films. Unfortunately the  "" extras "" are unplayable on my DVD player, only the movie  itself. ( the problem could be mine ? ) I enjoy the Medieval Knight-  Heroine Legend. Melancholic love  divided by jealousy and dark spell.  Somehow they connect through the help from a mischievous young thief and a  remorse priest.  The story might be drag, slow and predicable, very few  special effect has done in this film. It doesn't matter. As many other  viewers ever mentioned, the awful music just about ruined all the great  effort that cast and production crew try to provide,  so stupid and  unbearable. Even some TV score composers can do better job in this case.  Celtic Ballads could be perfect match, even enhance this film to a  masterpiece, worth memorable.

Additionally, watch  for some well-crafted portrayals of evil by both John Wood as the truly  despicable Bishop, and by Ken Hutchison as Hauer's ""replacement""  among the home troops, and as the Bishop's personal right-hand man.  Wood's  use of the perfect facial expressions and his acid tongue really shape the  character of the Bishop into a true force of evil to be reckoned with.  And, Hutchison in particular is an excellent villain here, combining the  physical fierceness required along with a menacing attitude that's a wonder  to behold!  The final fight scene between he and Hauer is believably  realistic, physically fierce and brutal, and draining to watch!  Also,  enough cannot be said about Leo McKern's turn as Imperius, whose portrayal  of the self-exiled priest with a haunted past is a pure cinematic delight.  McKern has the uncanny ability to slowly steal every scene in which he  appears, while at the same time raising the level of the acting ability of  all of his fellow performers.  He is an absolute gem!  Additionally, watch  for a truly remarkable scene that takes places between Rutger Hauer's  character Etienne Navarre and Matthew Broderick's Phillipe: Navarre, in a  fit of anger and exasperation, throws his sword at a tree beside Phillipe.  Watch for the absolutely startled and shocked look in Broderick's eyes as  he turns around after the sword comes within about a half-inch of him!  The  sword comes much closer to him in the final take of this scene than it did  in rehearsal, and it's a wonder Broderick was able to intelligently recite  his lines!  Excellent acting in the face of near-disaster!
Yes, the  music may seem slightly inappropriate at certain times, and the use of  modern languange at times can be a little distracting, but these are minor  things.  Excellent portrayals, perfect casting, great fantasy storyline,  and absolutely stunning use of physical locals, both inside and out, make  this a highly entertaining and enjoyable bit of escapism.

Broderick is saved from recapture by Rutger Hauer who  plays ""Navar"", the former captain of the Bishop's guard.  Michelle Pfeifer plays the hauntingly beautiful ""Isabo"" who loves  Navar.  Here's the catch -- the Bishop also desires Isabo.  When the Bishop  learned that Isabo was already in love with Navar, he fell from grace and  made a pact with the evil one to place a curse on the lovers -- during the  day Navar is a man, but Isabo is a hawk.  At night Navar transforms into a  large black wolf and Isabo reverts to her human form.  They are together  forever, eternally apart.  That's the situation Broderick falls  into.
This movie includes love and loyalty, deceit and repentance (on the  part of the lovers' former priest), drama, a good sword fight or two, a  touch of magical mystery, and, dare I say it? -- True love.
The  soundtrack was developed by Alan Parsons (of the Alan Parsons Project).  It  therefore has a a somewhat modern sound to it, but Parsons works his  musical magic to make it work with the medieval time frame.  I think it's a  wonderful touch to the movie.

Michelle Pfieffer, the beautiful Isabeau, is the  other half of the doomed and cursed lovers who are forced to suffer as a  result of the curse from the Bishop.

There  are many scenes that touch me, but my fave is where the doomed lovers are  in the ground and see each other for one brief second.  I cannot get  through that scene without crying.  When you watch it, you will know what I  mean.  This is a movie for everyone, and one that will certainly not  disappoint!",952819200,20,977,4.365168539325842
109284,5,079073463X,"A trully enjoyable movie. The selection of stars is unique and it works. Aided by an excellent supporting cast Pfeiffer, Hauer and Broderick really put the magic on the screen. I don't understand people griping about  Brodericks monologues. If anything, they don't belong with Woody Allen so  much as with Shakespeare. It is a classical case of comic relieve. The  action is fast-paced and the fights, coordinated by the same man who worked  for Lester in the Three Musketeers are particularly thrilling.",950140800,2,504,5.109756097560975
109285,5,079073463X,"This movie is about two lovers who are put under a spell. Captain Navarre becomes a wolf by night and his lover Isabeau is a beautiful hawk by day. Phillipe, a thief, escapes the the Dungons of Aquilla. He is saved by  Navarre and joins him on his quest to kill the Bishop. Phillipe tries to  escape once but Navarre finds him, again. Imperious the priest that betryed  them, tells Navarre ""Three days hence, there will be a day without a  night, and a night without a day."" But Narvarre doesn't believe him.  So all four of them venture back to Aquilla. I won't give away the ending,  but I can tell you this is an unbelieveable story of two lovers that are  ""together forever, eternaly apart"" and still love each other as  much they did before the curse. And, if you are a Matthew Broderick Fan, he  is diffently hot in this one!  It's a must see movie!",946512000,,855,4.320754716981132
109286,4,079073463X,"It's amazing how many people have seen this film even though it was never a critcal success at the box office.  Ladyhawke boasts an outstanding cast (I believe this to be Rutger Hauer's 2nd best film next to Blade Runner)  and an excellent script with an original storyline that many should find  quite engaging.  The costumes are first rate and the sword fights are the  most effective I have seen in film to date (neither Excalibur nor the  insulting First Knight were ever as effective with their fight sequences;  it should never look like you're swinging tooth picks around; swords are  heavy and fighting with them is exhausting; the director obviously realized  this fact and utilized it effectively in the finale--excellent).  Yes, the  music score for this film makes you scratch your head.  Nevertheless, there  are a handful of effective emotional tracks that tug you in the right  direction (and a couple that make you cringe).
Overall, a beautifully  shot film, high production quality, and an original story.  This is a  first-rate film that should please most.  This film never fails to impress  me.",946080000,37,1114,4.956521739130435
109287,5,079073463X,Ladyhawke was a wonderful tale of love and loyalty. I have never seen such a film before or since. It was very romantic to see how far people will go  to be with the ones they love. I highly recommend thi one.,941068800,,209,3.9761904761904763
109288,5,079073463X,"This movie is my favorite in this line of films.  No one is quite as luminous or lovely as Michelle Pfeiffer is in this role.  Rutger Hauer is great as her knight.  Matthew Broderick is a fantastic ""Mouse"".
""Ladyhawke"" has it all-adventure,love, mystery,action-you name  it.
It is truly a love story for the ages, and I would take my young  child to see it.  I cannot recommend it any more highly than that.",940377600,4,407,4.506849315068493
109289,5,079073463X,"I really like the tragic love story.  Wolves and hawks mate for life, and Isabeau and Navarre were even denied the same form.",937526400,,125,4.434782608695652
109290,5,079073463X,"Ladyhawke was one of the best movies ever ignored by the general populace when it was first released in theaters.  The storyline is right out of Grimm's Fairy Tales: Two lovers kept apart by the spell of an evil man  sworn to kill them if he cannot have the woman for himself.  ""Always  together, eternally apart.""  The score is indeed agressive, but  powerful music accentuates powerful scenes, and in my opinion is entirely  appropriate.  This movie has romance and action and I would recommend it to  anyone who loves medieval scene.  The animal work involved is also  excellently choreographed.",931132800,2,598,4.9393939393939394
109291,3,079073463X,"I was surprised that I liked this movie because, generally, I do not care for this genre.  I think having Michelle Pfeiffer staring in it helped quite a bit.  I was also surprised to find Rutger Hauer effective in his  roll (normally he is subject to `B' material at best).  All in all, an  interesting romantic fantasy that was handled quite effectively, although  it did drag in areas and seemed to go on much too long.
As far as the  controversial musical score, like anything in art, it's subjective.  I  happen to be an Alan Parson Project fan (Alan engineered the music), and  Andrew Powell often plays the orchestration for the Project.  Of course I  really liked the music, but do have to admit, however, I felt some of the  music seemed out of place for this type of motion picture.  Maybe if they  would have asked Pink Floyd....
Between 1 and 10, I give ""LadyHawke"" a  solid 6 (and the somewhat misplaced musical score a 7--yeah, I liked the  music a little more than I liked the film).",925948800,2,997,4.4804469273743015
