7854378,5,6303908160,"No one can plan anything and be able to carry it out exactly as anticipated; there is no exception. Whether the plan is war, politics, marriage, love, or deception, as it is in this psychological thriller. One always overlooks something or, in, most instances, fate causes something unexpected to happen that disrupts the plan. It might be something simple, like rain, lightning, a fall over an item left on the ground, or the appearance of someone from the past. Fate shows itself in this film.

Kate Vernon is excellent as the woman who begins her deception by taking the uniform of a female sergeant after a night of lesbian love. She travels to the home of a woman, Margot Kidder, her husband, adult son, and teen-age daughter claiming that she was the girl friend of their son who was just killed in action overseas. She says that the two were so much in love they were about to marry. Margot Kidder, the mother, believes her and accepts her into her home. Margot overacts her emotions, but this does not destroy the plot or suspense. Kate seduces the dead soldier's brother and alienates his girl friend who becomes jealous and determined to find out who Kate really is. Kate also seduces Kidder's husband, but does not have sex with him.

Viewers will be intrigued to find out what Kate is up to and who she is.",1306454400,3,1318,4.604255319148936
