Why is it that everyone here reviews the actual movie on the MST3k episode page, and then reviews the MST3k episode on the movie page? Murphy's Law really got into its element here. Everything you could possibly think of to make a movie worse is here. I don't care if Cisse Cameron really is Cameron Mitchell's daughter, she looks like his mother! Many times, the spaceship looks like a factory/boiler room, and sometimes you can even see light coming through the windows! To top it all off, the crew must have had not nearly enough material to make a feature film, so they added the bellarians, who do absolutely nothing yet take up more than half the screen time. This movie was not a total waste though, it was one of the best MST3k episodes of the Sci-fi era.",991785600,2,836,4.470588235294118

Half the movie takes place in a big basement, there is  the world's oldest daughter, commander Santa Claus, the woman that died and  mysteriously reappeared later in the movie, the 3 mph. enforcer races, our  big beefy hero (smash lampjaw), etc. And what the hell is with those  Bellarians? They did nothing throughout the entire move except dance around  with their lightning balls (which you can buy at Spencer's gifts) and  mumble things that just don't make any sense. They had absolutely nothing  to do with anything in the movie! I could go on forever and say all the  things that made me laugh hysterically, but that would take up more than  1,000 words. The thing that made me laugh the most is when Mike and the  bots make fun of Calgan when he laughs and makes those hilarious facial  expressions.

Well, I left the stunt business a loooong time back and even though I worked on numerous productions, I've never gotten around to watching most of them...until just recently when my cousin found and gave me the MSTK3 version of Space Mutiny.

During production the working title was ""Southern Sun"", and I remember it being freezing! Partly because of the time of year and also because I ran around in light cotton pants and a MX chest protector!

I knew most of the crew from previous productions, it was the late '80's in South Africa, and they knew me as a stuntman with some aspiration to also do some acting...I had 1 line to deliver...I remember clearly my mouth drying up and totally blue screening! Eventually the crew stopped laughing and the AC came over with a glass of water. Needless to say I was smart enough to recognize I wasn't cut out to be an actor. In fact I quite enjoyed doing the ""railing kills""/ ""slamming a stack of Pringles"" hehe!

I'm now in the process of collecting all the other works of ""art""! Enjoy - Lobster Man",1326844800,7,1100,4.45771144278607
534076,5,6302999472,"Earlier during the week Sid stumbled upon some 90's commercial clips leaving us in a nice nostalgic state thinking of some of the best years we've had. During this trip down memory lane we also happened to see a clip of a Thanksgiving Day Marathon of Mystery Science Theater 3000 presented by Adam West and thought wow would that be a nice treat. Unfortunately the current world suffers from a great lack of B appreciation and would never run a MST3K marathon so we decided to improvise. Since football kickoff was still a couple hours out we signed ourselves up for some pre-Thanksgiving Day festivities by watching one of the greatest nightmares of all time known as Space Mutiny. It's one of those fine films that leaves you in a state of disbelief that it actually exists.

Space Mutiny plot goes a little something like this; A giant meathead in a spandex spacesuit called Dave Ryder aka Lance Uppercut is placed in charge of saving a spaceship from space pirates. We're dead serious...stay with us here. See the ships security crew has grown tired of it's commander that looks like a space Santa Claus and has decided to turn the ship of to these space pirates to turn the crew into slavery. Well Dave Ryder isn't having any of this and fixes himself a vanilla marshmellow protein revolution with a scoop of peanut butter and half a banana to ensure muscle protection while snapping some necks. As he dismantles the heavily mulleted pirates one by one the tears we flow from non stop laughter. Obviously the MST3K crew bring the pain with a surplus of meathead jokes that hit Sid on so many levels

Space Mutiny is an absolute Pathmark 3.99 special and should be seen by every U.S citizen to show our thanks to the B community for all it's hard work. After doing a little IMDB research we learned the main character Lance Uppercut performed in quite a few horrible B movies outside of this one up until 1998 where he simple disappeared off the face of the earth to never be heard from again. What becomes quite apparent is the fact that Lance knew (much like Sid) that 90's B was where it's at a felt the industry falling away from the foundation B was built on. After that painful realization he hung up his spandex spacesuit and never looked back. He currently resides in Pine Bluff Arkansas and has been said to be operating under the name Art Vandeley....you know that actually sounds very familiar.",1290729600,,2409,4.613053613053613
534077,4,6302999472,"This is one of those movies that's so bad it's funny.  Space Mutiny takes place on a spaceship colony (which looks more like a factory) where stereotypical villian Kalgon (complete with maniacal laugh) is trying to take it over and land it on a pirate planet.  Out to stop him is our brave hero Ryder (who inexplicably wears only a tank top and khakis during laser battles).

Pretty dull plot, but what really sells it here is the cheap wardrobe, sets and ""special effects.""  These combined with the B-movie acting, plot holes and ridiculously bad action scenes make it a worthwhile viewing.",1267660800,,591,4.764705882352941

534079,1,6302999472,"I can see why Mystery Science Theater 3000 used this as one of its featured films; the acting is just over the top. I couldn't tell if they were all trying to be that bad or if they thought they were really doing a good job, I guess we will never know. All the space footage was stolen straight from battle star galactica, the bridge personnel were dressed in swim suits, jump suits and sleeveless costumes, nothing matched. Now for the interior of the ship it was nothing more than the inside of a factory which they didn't even try to make to look like a ship, I'm surprised they took the time to cover the windows.

I don't want to ruin the surprise ending but I was wondering if they were fool enough to think a sequel was in the offing.

534081,2,6302999472,"Take a deep breath...SPACE MUTINY finally arrives on DVD!!!  Since the artwork on the DVD mocks this movie mercilessly (without giving a plot summary), I'll quote from the 1989 VHS tape release from A.I.P. Home Video: FRONT COVER: ""There Is Nowhere To Hide From The Enemy Within!""  BACK COVER: ""Breathtaking Special Effects from the Team That Brought You 'STAR WARS'.  Starring Reb Brown (""Uncommon Valor""), James Ryan (""Rage to Kill""), John Phillip Law (""Barbarella"") and Cameron Mitchell (""My Favorite Year""), The enormous Southern Sun spacecraft faces destruction from within when the evil Kalgan (John Phillip Law) and his men take control through a violent and explosive mutiny.  Kalgan's plan: scrap the ship and sell the passengers into slavery.  Only one man, Reb Brown, has the strength and courage to lead the fight against Kalgan's rebels.  Armed with laser cannons and neutron grenades, he leads the Commander's daughter and a handful of soldiers into a blasting battle against Kalgan and his powerful forces.""--END QUOTE.  THIS IS A VERY BAD MOVIE, very possibly the worst space/adventure movie ever filmed--yet it does have an oddball charm to it.  Much has been made that this film uses special effects from the BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA TV series (1978-79).  In a way, the overall plot of SPACE MUTINY--an earth space-ark on a centuries long voyage who are led by a Moses-like commander--almost seems like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: The Next Generation.  The one man attack craft flown by Reb Brown is even called a ""Viper""--exactly like on ""Battlestar Galactica""!  If you look closely--watch for a cameo appearance by Lorne Greene in a scene featuring ""Battlestar Galactica"" stock footage F/X--the scene where the Bridge is attacked, Greene can be seen on the Bridge with his back to the camera in a distance shot.  I found the picture and sound quality of the DVD to be relatively clear--roughly the equal of any other low-budget movie made in the 1980's.  Since this WAS an incredibly low-budget film, I'm convinced that it was filmed in Full Frame with an eye towards the home video market--I doubt that this was made in Widescreen (but I could be wrong--who knows?).  One oddity though--the VHS release runs 91 minutes and 30 seconds, while the DVD runs 87 minutes--does anyone know what footage was cut for the DVD release?  If you're a fan of the Original ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series, the camp-classic movie ""Dark Star"" or space-adventure films and TV shows in general, SPACE MUTINY is well-worth adding to your collection.  I rate it a generous 2 Stars.  BTW--To my surprise, I LOVED the SONG/MUSIC--""The Edge of a Dream"" that is heard during the End Credits!",1227312000,,2679,5.066059225512529
534082,1,6302999472,"""Space Mutiny"" is a classic of bad cinema.  This movie gained fame as the basis of one of the best episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and you would think someone would have released the movie on its own long before now.  Well, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment has rushed out this DVD and it is nothing more than the VHS version burned onto a DVD.  The audio quality is poor: there are no audio options and I actually had a hard time getting the sound chanelled through my set!  The video quality is awful: grainy and washed out...it looks like what it is: a cheap bootleg. In short, don't be seduced by the small pricetag and buy this garbage.  I have many bootleg DVDs that are of much better quality than this.  ""Space Mutiny"" deserves to finally be released in a Widescreen format, hopefully with the deleted scenes that are present on the cover of the VHS version.  Until then, there is the VHS version and, of course, the MST3K version for you to purchase.  Stay away from this poor quality DVD.  It is just junk and Amazon should be ashamed of itself for continuing to stock it.",1199491200,17,1089,4.459595959595959
534083,3,6302999472,"In the same context that Plan 9 from Outer Space is bad and should be watched, Space Mutiny is a lesson of things NOT to do.

Rule Number 1
Do NOT cast your grandmother as the female romantic lead.  It's just plain creepy.

Rule Number 2
Continuity is important.  Do NOT show dead crew members on the bridge after you kill them off.

Rule Number 3
Should you feel that your man brute leading character has a need to yell, do NOT let him scream like a little girl.  It just ruins the image.

Rule Number 4
If you want to show dance clubs in outer space. Do NOT use hula hoops and do NOT let your grandmother use one.  She could dislocate her hip.

Rule Number 5
When people get shot, it is NOT necessary that they jump to their deaths over a railing.  After the first 60 times, people start to expect it.

This movie is just awful.  My guess is that they filmed half of it in an empty warehouse and the other half in a brewery.  This film should not be viewed without chemical supplements.  Should you find yourself lost in the plot of this flop, you could lose your mind.

This is best viewed with the commentary of the MST3k crew.  You can watch it without it, but, like running with scissors, I recommend you don't.",1198713600,7,1217,4.203463203463204

Mystery Science Theater skewered this cinematic offal to uproarious effect.  There's so many elements that leave you speechless; The space ship interior that looks suspiciously like a commercial warehouse and the exterior shots ripped off from the 70's Battlestar Galactica series.  The crewmember that is killed and magically appears in the very next scene unharmed.

  The story is some mess about the title event and it has some of the worst chase scenes (on floor sweepers and tricked out golf carts) ever put on screen. If you enjoy poor film making this piece of rotten mess can be great fun.",1174953600,2,591,4.258928571428571
534126,5,6302999472,"While the quote of my title comes from the MST3K guys describing the hula-disco scene (which really is startling), this is actually the original, non-MST3K version of this hilarious monstrosity. Like most viewers, I had first seen this film on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" but I wanted to see the pre-riffed version. This is it, and it is much more painful than the version with MST3K treatment.

By now just about everyone knows the general plot: evil over-actor Kalgan (John Phillip Law) starts a mutiny on a spaceship ran by Santa Claus, an Australian guy, and a bodybuilding nitwit who yells ""Move!"" a lot (Reb Brown.) There is a fabulously grotesque subplot about the Captain's daughter who appears in spandex despite seeming to be old enough to be Slab Bulkhead's (or whatever his name is) mother. The best scene in the movie has got to be her dancing in the nightclub with a hula hoop, an act so disgraceful that not only did it lead the MST3K guys to quip ""So, in the future there's absolutely no shame,"" but also ""She's presenting like a mandrill,"" both of which were spot on the money; unfortunately with this version you just have to think the commentary silently. Truly this scene will be etched into your brain for life, so be prepared.

It became evident very quickly that MST3K had edited the film down for time quite a bit, but they did so quite well, as all the extra film here is as boring as can be: it is mostly more of chasing around in the golf carts, more railing kills (where stuntmen fall off railings to their death), and a bit more exposition in which we learn that Kalgan's first name is Elijah. In other words: it is better to watch the MST3K version for yet another reason, namely brevity.

This movie became one of my favorite MST3K episodes, and it is fun to see this, the original, with it's silly sets (the inside of the spaceship looks like an old smelting facility, while the exteriors are all clearly old ""Battlestar Galactica"" retreads) and ridiculous bogus technical talk. My favorite piece of techno-babble is when they talk about the ""gas expulsion sump,"" which makes Leah (the hula hoop queen) ask ""What's that smell?"" Despite having just opened the valve on a tank of (clearly labeled) methane, I still think that the answer would have to be ""This movie.""

I give this movie five stars for being like a really old cheese: stinky, yet good at the same time. ""Space Mutiny"" is a deliciously bad piece of gouda.",1102204800,9,2454,4.63448275862069

THIRLL as a Woman dies, and then is miraculiously ressurected only minutes later as a scene shot before her death comes AFTER it, MARVEL at ""Slab Bulkhead"" Dave Ryder defends the Battlestar Gaalctica...I mean, the Southern Sun from the evil forces of the evil Kalgon and Robbie Robertson, annd SCREAM as you watch the forces of good and evil fall from UNBELVIABLE HEIGHTS from railings that infest the ship.

534128,4,6302999472,"Released in 1988, Space Mutiny, much like the 80's, is cheesy and cheap yet unbelievably entertaining and funny. This film was featured in Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which still airs in the Sci Fi channel. On video alone, the movie tries to take itself seriously. This may not be to everyone's liking since the film is so campy it's more suited for comedy as presented in Mystery Science Theatre 3000, with all the hilarious ad libs. Stars Reb Brown (Captain America, Yor Hunter From The Future) a buffed up hunk action star from the 80's) formerly respected serious actor Cameron Mitchell and John Phillip Law from Barbarella 1968. The lead actress, Cissi something or other, is married to Reb Brown. They met and fell in love with each other during the production of this Battle Star Galactica rip off.
The scenes of outer space and starships are taken directly from Battle Star Galactica, a series which was itself a rip off of Star Wars. The starship run by Captain Kalgan and his daugther, who looks 40-ish and does not convince as a girl in her 20's which she is trying to play, soon falls under mutiny. It's up to the heroic Dave Ryder (Reb Brown) to save the day. There are many camp classic elements. The ship is swarming with scantily clad women, the lead actress looks old though she is the love interest of the much younger Ryder. The scene of their first meeting in the dance club is hilarious and the love scene in the greenhouse is so hard to look at because of the age difference. Did anyone notice how one of the ladies on board who was part of the commanding unit died and then re-appeared as if nothing had happened ? John Phillip Law is older in this film and is not the sexy angel he was in Barbarella. Cameron Mitchell, the captain, looks like Santa Claus or God. The music is 80's and the closing theme song souds like ""She's A Maniac"" at one point.
The Berellian ladies with their strange religious ritual dancing can get annoying. The chase in the golf cart type vehicles is also pretty funny. The movie is a cult classic and if you like the 80's and low budget films then this is one for you. I give it 4 stars. I think you ought to stick with the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version as everyone suggests. Hilarious adventure in outer space. There are a few things that make this movie adult though, such as nudity, a sex scene, violence and the use of the b- word. Not for the whole family but entertaining to some, especially if you remember the 80's.",1088208000,3,2483,4.483443708609271
534129,5,6302999472,"I have to disagree with most of the other reviewers (especially those that can't spell) and unreservedly recommend Space Mutiny for everyone that loves Sci-Fi, or unintentional comedy.

  The movie is supposed to take place in the bowels of a ""Mother Ship"" (footage stolen from ""Battlestar.."") filled with the third generation of refugees from a dead planet.  One of the refugees, ELIJAH (snicker) KALGAN (John Philip Law) by name, decides he's sick of living on the spaceship and wants to live on a ""real planet.""  He hatches a plot to take over the ship, sell the other occupants of the ship into slavery to ""Space Pirates"" and then live in luxury on a ""real planet.""  Hence the name, ""Space Mutiny.""  Doesn't sound too bad so far, right?  Well, that's when Space Pilot DAVE RYDER (Reb Brown) enters the picture, silver lame' pants and all, and the movie starts to turn on the stink.

  Space Mutiny is a rock 'em, sock 'em, sci-fi shoot 'em up filmed in an abandoned warehouse that is supposed to be the environs of the previously mentioned spaceship.  Did I mention you can clearly see the windows at the top of the warehouse?  Other highlights include: characters that die only to reappear later in the movie with no explanation, characters chasing each other in pimped-out floor waxers called ""eliminators,"" Kalgan looks evil with increasingly less enthusiasm, our hero Dave Ryder routinely emits high-pitched ""battle screams,"" unintentional nudity (don't ask), and a guest appearance by the Band's Robbie Robertson as the evil and crippled turncoat officer.

  You don't have to be a ""Best Brains"" member to be able to make fun of this movie, and that's why it stands on its own.  It's so bad it's good...DARN good!

MST3K!!  Whether you're a fan of the show or if you have never watched Mystery Science Theatre, THIS is the one episode to find.  I was lucky enough to find it on one of the original DVD releases.  It is the TREASURE of my MST3K library!  Hilarious is not even close to being an appropriate adjective to describe Mike Nelson and the bots' treatment of this Sci-Fi disaster.  As fans of MST3K know, most episodes are not laughs all the way through.  There can be many moments of hilarity, true, but to have a steady stream of hysterical one-liners and smart-ass remarks such as in this episode is a rarity!  I recommend wearing an adult diaper and not drinking anything as it's sure to come out of your nose.  My stomach muscles hurt for two days after my first viewing!
""Beef Chestrock"" and the Captain's ""grandma-daughter"" trying to have any sort of on-screen chemistry is a riot with or without the MST3K treatment, but with it?  It's priceless.  When the daughter shimmies down a rope, she is greeted by the heckling of ""Spider Skank!"" to the tune of Spiderman.

534133,1,6302999472,"I have to admit that I would never have seen this movie had it not appeared on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I expect that NO ONE would have seen it had it not appeared there in fact.
Sometime, somewhere probably in the future, there's a big colony ship called strangely enough ""the Southern Sun"", it's actually the BattleStar Galactica, but we're not supposed to notice. Some elderly teenagers in disturbingly ill-fitted spandex man the ship. They're all lead by bloated Captain Alex Jansen (think Santa Claus), the captain's daughter Leah (or is it Leia), Evil security chief Kalgon and a big chunk of beef named Dave Ryder, our ""hero"". The plot revolves around a scheme by Kalgon's security enforcers to take over the ship and land it somewhere so that they can be free, which doesn't seem all that bad to me. But it's up to Bag-of-Hammers, I mean Ryder to stop their foul plot to be free. Anyway, not much happens, a Stevie Nicks cult shows up via a BattleStar Galactica shuttle (again don't notice that), our ""hero"" bails out on, thereby killing, a famous scientist in his BattleStar Galactica-style fighter ship (shhhh!), we visit the ship's Buck Rodgers style disco, then the morgue/dentist office. There's an epic golf cart chase, some people fall over the many handrails placed all around this futuristic starship and our ""hero"" deliberately sets fire to an unarmed crippled bad guy, HURRAY!
Aside from the atrocious writing, ridiculous plot and stilted acting, this movie has other certain flaws. For example it features very poor editing which allows a murdered crewman to return to bridge duty in the very next scene after her body is discovered outside the ship`s disco. It's also painfully obvious that the bulk of this movie was filmed in a warehouse, The handrails, cement floors and foldout windows are a dead giveaway. There's also the brick lined trench in which our ""hero"" incinerates a bad guy. Bricks and cement just don't seem line real good starship raw material to me.
The movie stars Cameron Mitchell as Captain Santa Claus, Cisse Cameron (no relation) as his elderly young daughter and Reb Brown a.k.a. Big McLarge Huge as Ryder, also starring John Phillip Law as Kalgon, who never once takes anyone away. If you must see ""Space Mutiny"", get your hands on the MST3K version of it; I can't imagine watching it any other way.",1005264000,4,2350,4.848258706467662
534134,5,6302999472,"5 stars based on an MST rating scale!  This movie was MADE for Mike and the bots... and is so far the funniest MST movie I've seen. It is super ridiculous and you must NOT watch it unless it is the MST version.  So, this must have been  direct to video.  Yeah, Calgon, take me away?  Big McLarge Huge?  A bunch of porn stars in space wearing aluminum foil arobics wear? I LOVE the 2 mile an hour Enforcer chase - my  grandma coulda walked that in less time!  Spencer gift static balls?  whatever.  I could go on and on... but what an awful movie!  However, all you MST fans have to admit that if it wasn't for such wonderful ""crap"" we wouldn't get to laugh so hard.  So thank YOU Mr. Mitchell Cameron or Cameron Mitchell - whatever - for such incredible yuk!  But my deepest thanks go out to Mike, Servo and Crow.  Thank you!  Thank you SO much for making this movie worth seeing!",996451200,3,880,4.18562874251497

If you are looking at one of the most funny, stupid, lame, idiotic and silly films of all time this is it.
Space Mutiny is legendary to those of us who have seen it on MST3K.
With stock footage from the original Battlestar Galacitca on the outside and massive basement sets on the inside this movie is filled to the boilers with silly characters and a plotline pulled directly from someones nether regions.
If you want a movie about go karts fighting each other in a basement with loads of people dying from railing kills well you are in the right place.
Featuring Reb Brown as Slab Bulkhead... I mean David Ryder
Cisse Cameron as the elderly looking Lea Jansen
And John Phillip Law as Commander Kalgan (blow me away!)

It was one of my favorite episodes of MST3K during its years on the SCI-Fi Channel.  A great movie to buy where you can learn about ancient dentistry and also see a laser the sounds like a drill.  Also, the great resolution on formica monitors.  Have some laughs with Slab bulkhead and watch as he fights Kalgan on a ship that looks a lot like the Battlestar Galactica but it isn't, but it is.",1520640000,,491,4.293478260869565

Too many fires on a spacecraft will use up all the oxygen, no engineer would build an flamethrower. How does a pilot with a pistol outshoot six guys with rifles. Why no uniform code of dress? Why so many directors? This might have made an interesting tv series, no worse than battle star galactica was.",1515196800,,418,4.586666666666667

7834320,5,6302999472,"SPACE MUTINY (aka: MUTINY IN SPACE- 1988) is set in the far distant future, where a titanic space station floats through the galaxy, carrying the remnants of mankind. Led by their benevolent leader, Alex Jansen (Cameron Mitchell), who resembles an alien Santa Claus, men in huge-shouldered uniforms work alongside women in 80's-style Jazzercise outfits. Oh no! Saboteurs have set off explosives, causing big trouble on Jansen-Claus' ship! Beautiful, psychic female visitors, known as the Valerians have arrived on board, apparently to do their yoga and modern dance routines, accompanied by their orbs of mystery (aka: storm balls). The title mutiny starts out small, when a miscreant stirs up dissent. This is quite easy to do, as he just stares wide-eyed and cackles a lot. Enter musclebound, space-fighter pilot, Dave Ryder (Reb Brown), who is basically a mountainside w/ teeth. Yeah! Check out the space station disco club! Whew! It's great to see that hula hoops will still be the rage in the future, along w/ towering hair and spandex! Look out! Here comes the bump-em car chase sequence! In spaaaaace! Can these clown cars possibly go any slower? Can Ryder get to the bottom of things before this movie gets anywhere near interesting? You haven't lived until you've seen Ryder in silver pants, being pursued by men in balaclavas and face masks (available at any paintball supply shop)! This, while Space Commander Santa sits in his chair in various robes, dispensing wisdom. It's time now for the obligatory love scene. In spaaaace! With its space battle scenes, shamelessly lifted from the original BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, its space station interiors looking more like the inside of a sewage treatment facility, and the laughable characters, we've got the essential ingredients for a hyper-schlock spectacular! EXTRA POINTS: For the shoosh-shoosh sound the doors make when they open and close! EXTRA EXTRA POINTS: For those Valerians, who just! Keep!! Dancing!!! EXTRA MEGA POINTS: For the hilarious shrieks made by anyone hit by those awesome ray guns! Oh yes, there will be cheeeze!... P.S.- Be sure to allow nothing to deter you from witnessing the final clown car fight! It's what the chariot race scene from BEN HUR would have looked like, if that film had been directed by a hard-boiled egg w/ a face painted on it!...",1511222400,3,2330,5.102094240837697

Camera angles could have been better thought out, and as others have pointed out, too much falling from the cat walks. The golf cart chase was..., well, different.

However, the story really is pretty good, and once you get past the cheesy stunts and start watching, you start ruting for the main characters which always makes for good sci-fi, no matter how cheesy it is.",1445904000,,510,4.302083333333333
