8166360,4,B000M5AL8Y,"If you already have the earlier series, ""TANKS! Barbarossa and Kursk"" you may want to wait until the price is lower then $15. The movies are around 50 minutes.  The army group north, south, and center series are a good way to view the Russian front but I was expecting more.  Many of the speakers are used from the TANKS! series and repeated word for word on many an occasion.  I would recommend these over the hell on earth scorched earth film of the russian front.",1177718400,5,466,4.395348837209302
8166361,5,B000M5AL8Y,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  The analysis was outstanding and insightful.  Another pleasant surprise was how the archive film footage in most cases was appropriate to the time and location that it represented - an unusual event.  I bought this one disc as a trial and if the others are as good as this, the investment will be a bargain.",1173657600,6,362,4.538461538461538
