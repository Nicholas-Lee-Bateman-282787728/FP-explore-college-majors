3620735,5,B001GUYAZY,Amazing!! is incredible this movie is so old none of the scenes or even behavior of the characters feels dated at all- is so much fun to watch it is just incredible.

3620736,5,B001GUYAZY,"WONDERFUL FILM. Clark really should have done more of this type of films- light, breezy yet full of zest. The plot, setting, dialougues and the rest you name it - are all so well put that it is hard to believe this movie was filmed more than 80 yrs ago!!!",1519257600,,255,4.12
3620737,5,B001GUYAZY,"1934, Frank Capra director, 5 Oscars, lots of fun. a little cheesy in places, ie when group of people are singing on the bus.

Seems a little out of place. blu ray quality very good. several interesting extras as well",1518652800,,304,4.648148148148148

3620750,5,B001GUYAZY,"The only reason to buy a movie is because you already know you like it. I don't see people buying movies they haven't watched already. However that might be different with these classics. If someone told you about it and you can't find it anywhere else you might buy it. Or maybe you like a particular actor or actress. Whatever the reason you're planning on buying this movie, there's no review that can depict your personal taste. Either you like a movie or you don't. I can't decide that for you.

I like this movie. The product Packaging was nice. I hate digital copies they're always glitchy a DVD or Blu-ray is always the way to go. And you could watch them without the internet which is a big plus when it goes out.",1510358400,,722,4.388059701492537

3620755,5,B001GUYAZY,Really enjoyable old movie.,1508976000,,27,6.0
3620756,4,B001GUYAZY,"I enjoyed this film, as I also enjoy pretty Claudette Corbet and 1930s icon Clark Gable who shined up the 1930s silver screens with numerous films including the fabulous ""Gone with the wind"".
Here, Gable is an arrogant New York newspaper reporter on the verge of losing his job. Claudette is a rich tycoon's daughter sick of being controlled, which she was to quite intense extremes here. What kind of father would send law enforcement officers to track her grown up adult daughter down for moving across country to get married? Even if the dad disapproves, I seriously doubt that even in the 1930s a father would do that. She was acting kind of bitchy towards the start of the movie with her dad, but under the circumstances I'd explained, I sort of understand. And what was up with the servants on their yaht acting so afraid of Claudette where they were scared to even bring dinner into the room just because Claudette was angry? I didn't think that any self respecting grown man in the 1930s would act scared like that.

Now the rest of the film was great. The first paragraph above was the reason I subtracted a star, but the other 4 stars are for the greatness of the rest of the film with Claudette and Gable, every moment between those two on their journey was wonderful and funny. Claudette meets Clark on the bus from Florida to New York. It was sort of a 1930s road movie with the terrific humor, wit, and dialogue. Just to name a few of my favorite scenes;  the wit between Clark and the ornery bus driver (Driver: ""oh yeh?""  Clark: "" now why didn't I thinka that? Our argument woulda been over"" Driver: ""oh yeh?"" Clark: ""you keep that up, we ain't gonna get anywhere"" Driver: ""oh yeh?"" Clark: "" Ya got me. Yeh."" Hilarious), the part with Clark first finding out about Claudette in the paper running to King Wesley (Clark seeing Claudette as the perfect story to patch things up with his embittered boss) , the part at the cabin during their stopover night discussing ""the walls of Jericho"" and Clark explaining how a man undresses, the part where Clark lies about being a gangster to the smarmy ""believe you me"" Shapely since Shapely already has annoyed Clark for talking Claudette's ear off against her will and is now blackmailing Clark to take some of the reward money from Claudette's father for her return to him, then some great dialogue during the outdoor nighttime scene with them camping out,  Clark and Claudette hitchhiking (Claudette lifting her dress to expose her calf to stop a car successfully, when Clark and his 'expertise' on all the different thumb signals couldn't stop one car. Then; Clark: ""why didn't you take off all your clothes, you coulda stopped 40 cars?"" Claudette: "" I'll remener that next time we need 40 cars"". Funny), .and then there's Clark and the carrots (which allegedly inspired Bugs Bunny). And then there's more, there's just not enough room to write it all. It was very enjoyable",1506816000,,2934,4.6473988439306355
3620757,5,B001GUYAZY,A Wonderful old movie. Thanks.,1506643200,,30,5.2

3620759,5,B001GUYAZY,Excellent movie with an excellent cast. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes quality movies with excellent actors. It did not win the Academy Award for nothing!,1505606400,,171,5.142857142857143
3620760,5,B001GUYAZY,"This movie is a classic....and classics are the best. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are quite a couple too. This is an ""oldie but goodie"" movie,and we love it.",1505088000,,163,4.655172413793103
3620761,5,B001GUYAZY,"This is my favorite movie of all time! It was my grandfather's favorite too. I have a love for the classics and also a love for Clark Gable. I believe that this is his best performance, because it is so true to his own personality. I showed it to my husband who does not really care for older movies. He really liked it and laughed the whole time. The chemistry between the two is comical and very believable. I truly believe that romance isn't always flowers and walks on the beach. This paints a picture of romance in a way that isn't always represented in Hollywood. Sometimes love is rough around the edges with a little bit of hate. This movie brings me joy every time I watch it, and it is one that I can watch over and over again.",1504742400,,737,4.23404255319149
3620762,4,B001GUYAZY,A solid 4. I have to admit that I was made to watch this film for a class I'm taking and was pleasantly surprised. I think the only ding was the constant screaming and complaining that the main male character did throughout the film. I do understand that this was a different time and era but even taking out the male chauvinist parts there was way too much screaming by him. The female lead was just a wonderful actress. It was so pleasant to hear her voice and to watch her act. I would say the best actor/actress in the whole movie was the female. Just my two cents.,1504569600,,569,4.229357798165138
3620763,5,B001GUYAZY,Outstanding story and wonderful performances. A complete delight!,1503532800,,65,7.25
3620764,5,B001GUYAZY,"The granddaddy of all screwball comedies is one that escaped me until recently. I ordered the DVD and watched it. When they say they don't make this kind of movie anymore, I believe it. It was one enchanting film, it left me with a warm fuzzy feeling. The dialogue was witty, the chemistry between the leads was marvelous, and I even paid attention to the supporting characters. I saw a plot that was reminiscent of ""Roman Holiday"" which this film proceeded by over 20 years. The ""walls of Jericho"" and the ""coffee dunking"" scenes were just plain funny but it was the hitchhiking scene that had me in stitches. This film won and deserved the Oscars it was nominated for. A winner all the way !!",1501891200,,694,4.515873015873016

3620766,5,B001GUYAZY,Great DVD and very well acted.  This is one picture that deserved the best picture Oscar and actually got it!

3620771,5,B001GUYAZY,This is one of my top 5 Favorites from the 1930's Movies,1496620800,,56,3.75
3620772,5,B001GUYAZY,"I can't say anything negative about this eternally fresh, funny, sweet, happy, romantic, witty, well-paced film. Gable and Colbert shine in their roles. Many classics in this one, such as the hitchhiking roadside scene, the titular photo carrot scene, and a bus load of fascinating, distinctly individual characters. I judge a film by the secondary players. If the character acting is worthy the film for me is gold.

This one is gold.

Our protagonists are taken through a series of mishaps and adventures, a white-knuckle moment or two, then we're treated to a stand-up-and-cheer ending.

What more could you ask of an evening's entertainment?",1496534400,,645,5.1826923076923075

3620782,3,B001GUYAZY,"This is a 4k restoration? From Criterion?

Long story short - the transfer may be as good as you're going to get as far as resolution (not the best film quality and in that frustrating aspect ratio with black bars down the sides)... but the exposure was better on the DVD, especially in certain scenes.  The first ""Walls of Jericho"" scene for instance, on the DVD you can clearly enjoy that lovely slip Claudette is wearing, while on this Blu-ray it is so dark that there is no detail at all.  Just look at that utterly crisp, perfectly exposed frame from that scene which they used on the cover - to me that's kind of misleading since the actual Blu-ray doesn't look nearly that good... for me, it was certainly a BIG letdown.

Of course it's also disappointing that some special features from the DVD didn't get included in the Blu-ray, so now I have to keep both in my collection instead of ""trading up"" like I prefer to do to keep things streamlined.

If this had been a regular release at a more reasonable price, I wouldn't have minded so much... but this is definitely below par for Criterion, so the premium you pay is hard to justify.",1491264000,,1143,4.44976076555024

3620785,5,B001GUYAZY,"the original romantic comedy. hilarious movie with wonderful acting and great chemistry between Colbert and Gable. in my senior year of college I took cinematic appreciation as an elective. I sat amongst a sea of freshmen who groaned when the professor began this film. I turned to the girl next to me and said ""wait for it"" (I had seen and fallen in love with it on Turner Classic Movies when I was young). by the end of the class, the entire auditorium was laughing and chatting and couldn't wait to write their paper on the movie.",1489449600,,533,4.505154639175258
3620786,5,B001GUYAZY,Clark Gables' only Oscar. Colbert is fantastic. Very well written.,1489017600,,66,5.7
3620787,5,B001GUYAZY,"This may be but a wish-fulfillment farce, but well-crafted all the same. It is never dull, and the story keeps you off-balance so the viewer never can really be sure how things will turn out.

A spoiled daughter of a very rich father, tiring of his gilded cage, finally runs off to elope with a daredevil aviator, who is in New York. The father hires a slew of detectives to locate her, but she manages to get on a bus with a reporter who has heard about her situation and wants a big story to boost his career. With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way. And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.

Great character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies.",1488758400,,1056,4.523560209424084

3620811,1,B001GUYAZY,"I love this movie it gets a 5 plus Star Rating, but the HD version I rented, which looks as if it were all filmed during a very, very dark night... gets a minus 1 star rating. The very short opening scene of the boat on water looks normal, but the immediate scene following is so dark one can barely see the characters or the surrounds. Yes, the bus and nighttime cabin scenes are filmed at night, but I have seen this film any number of times before in various venues and the characters and scenery were able to be clearly seen here. And the daylight scenes appear as if it is night also. By this point I finished watching it because the version I rented gave me 48 hours from opening and no recourse was given after opening. This was a waste of my time and the rental fee of $3.99. The only recourse given was to stop transaction prior to opening...a catch-22 for me. I rented the exact HD version shown in the Title above, which could have been a mistake since this was not filmed in HD. Due to a broken hip, I also viewed this on my laptop. What did I do wrong? Has no one else had this problem?  Please let me know. I love Amazon Prime and this is the first viewing or procedure disappointment I have had.

  This is the first movie to ever win ALL five major Oscars (i.e. Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress). Those of you that have seen it know why. And, those of you that have never seen this movie should do yourself a HUGE favor and buy it  trust me, if you like old movies, you will not regret the purchase of this one. This movie is considered by many (myself included) to be amongst the very best romantic comedies that has ever been made! In fact, many cinephiles and film historians consider it to be the archetype of the modern romantic comedy in film. Further, it is a fine example of the kind of witty, well-crafted and highly entertaining early 1930's Hollywood movies that they (regretfully) don't make any more. Highly recommended. See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 1.33:1  B&W  1080p  MPEG-4 (25.3 Mbps)

  While this transfer, at first blush, appears to be rather soft and lacking in detail (which is characteristic of MOST of the movies on disc from this same period), upon closer inspection, one finds that it actually exhibits excellent picture quality (considering the source)  as there are absolutely NO artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines or dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a film from this era) are frequently VERY good  with textures of most clothing and many faces and hair-styles being readily apparent and finely defined. Also, contrast and gray scale are VERY good overall, and in many scenes, even excellent. This is probably the best that this movie has EVER looked  even when it was first released.

AUDIO: LPCM 1.0 (48KHz / 24 bit)

  The artisans at the Criterion Collection have obviously done extensive clean-up work on the film's soundtrack, because there are no pops, bumps or hiss in evidence. Also, the dialog is very clear and fairly natural sounding, with all voices being clearly defined and easily understood. However, the transfer's dynamic range is fairly limited, and there isn't any deep bass nor any top-end to speak of (though, what is there sounds MUCH better than one would expect under the circumstances). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic dialog-driven movie, this film's soundtrack has very good sound quality.

3620838,5,B001GUYAZY,"One of my great all time favorites, this movie is a must for Clark Gable fans. He essentially plays the same type of character, but perfected it in this classic Capra movie. And he and Colbert play off each other beautifully. These movie is even more compelling because none of the people involved thought this would do well at the box office. In fact, none of the leading cast even wanted to do the movie. Gable did it to fulfill a contract with MGM. And Colbert was talked into it. Neither was particularly interested in starring with the other. But as filming progressed and the cast became comfortable with each other, Gable, Colbert, Walter Connelly, etc., seemed to truly enjoy the give and take involved in the scenes. The singing of ""The Man On the Flying Trapeze"" during the bus trip is not to be missed. Carla told the first man to start singing and just kept the camera roll as the rest of the actors played out the scene. You can see how much fun they were having. And that is how I feel about the whole movie. Give it a chance-I promise that you won't be disappointed.",1461888000,,1081,4.437185929648241

3620858,3,B001GUYAZY,"Quick Story recap:  A wealthy woman is on the run from her father. who wishes her marriage annulled,  to reunite with her wealthy husband. She meets Peter Warne, fired reporter, who is trying to help her to get to New York for the reunion, while getting the big story out of it.

Acting of course is good from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.  They had great chemistry together.  Despite all of Gable's insults, he still somehow manages to have some tenderness in there.  Claudette nicely managed coming off as a spoiled heiress and then evolving into a more charming woman too.

I thought it was a good movie.  It had some great dialogue, witty stuff you don't hear today.  It had some comedy bits perfectly sprinkled in - as in not too much to be hokey and not too little to be too serious.  It is good throughout and the story does have good movement. The ending also has an endearing old world feel.  I don't have anything critical to say about the movie as a whole. It was a different time then so the very sexist controlling actions and dialogue from Gable,  can't be graded by today's standards.  I watched it because it was an Oscar winner. I don't think it's something everyone needs to rush out and see.  I liked it but kinda wish I wouldn't have bought it as I don't think I really want to watch it again - I don't know just too dated for me to really want to jump into that world again.",1453680000,,1400,4.334615384615384

3620864,3,B001GUYAZY,"A great movie in its day, it isn't as good as Capra's 'Mr. Deeds goes to town' or some of his others.  I am not sure why Colbert won the academy award. Some of the other actresses of the day would have been more engaging.  She looks bored.",1451088000,,239,3.9583333333333335
3620865,5,B001GUYAZY,"I suppose I've seen this movie close to a dozen times over the years, and although I know it inside and out, scene-by-scene, I never get tired of watching it. On average, I go 3 years, or so, between viewings, and that way it stays fresh. The chemistry between Colbert and Gable is just terrific-one of the best pairings in the history of movie making, in my opinion. It's right up there with Hepburn and Tracey, Bacall and Bogart, Wayne and O'Hara, Loy and Powell and Cary Grant with Irene Dunne (Cary was great opposite almost any leading lady, though).

It Happened One Night might be the very first Screwball Comedy, a genre I especially enjoy. Colbert is just perfect as spoiled heiress Ellen Andrews, a poor little rich girl used to having everything she wants. That is until her tycoon father puts his foot down on her marriage to ne'er-do-well pilot and fortune-hunter ""King"" Westley, demanding she get an immediate annulment. Naturally, she protests loudly, throwing a tantrum while on board her Daddy's yacht, then ultimately jumping overboard. Daddy puts out an all points bulletin that she be found and offers a reward for her safe return to his custody. Enter Peter Warne, a freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter, perfectly played by the one and only (and very young) Clark Gable. All manner of hijinks and hilarity ensue, with the two of them in one treasured scene after another. Colbert is adorably petulant, Gable is rakishly sweet, and together they are matchless perfection.

One of Hollywood's best ever, of that there is no doubt! Directed by the master himself, Frank Capra, this one won Oscars in all five major categories, a feat unmatched until One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest over four decades later. You can't go wrong with It Happened One Night.",1451001600,,1774,4.851485148514851

This movie was awesome! The banter between these two was fantastic! I don't think there was a single second that I didn't enjoy. I recommend 100%, two thumbs up, .

Wikipedia Fun Fact: This was the first film to win all 5 major Academy Awards! Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. It took 41 years for another film to do the same. In 1993 the Library of Congress preserved this film in the the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. It also has a few interesting parallels with"" Bugs Bunny! Thats pretty cool! Film Daily praised it as ""a lively yarn, fast-moving, plenty humorous, racy enough to be tantalizing, and yet perfectly decorous.",1448496000,,1052,4.801104972375691

People had talent back then.  I was disappointed in Claudette Colbert.  She could be so vicious - even though she was just acting, it bothered me.

Together they take viewers through a series of hilarious romps as they try to evade her father's detectives who are trying to find her and prevent her from reaching her playboy husband to whom she was married in a rushed civil ceremony.  Gable is an unemployed reporter who meets her on a bus and is fascinated and irritated by her imperious attitude without knowing who she is, but is somehow instinctively and understandingly drawn to her.  There are a continuous series of mishaps and missteps which they encounter as he tries to help her get to New York after learning her identity and getting her agreement to her exclusive story upon her successful arrival in N.Y.

Look for Ward Bond as the bus driver. He would appear in many classic movies like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with Jimmy Stewart and ""Gone With The Wind"" with his friend Clark Gable.

But I appreciate the story - the acting and really liked seeing the world as it was then - that old bus was  a riot.  Read about the back story on this and interesting the $ that the lead actress was paid (outrageous in those days) and the circumstances that Clark Gable had and was on loan to this studio to make the movie.  Turned out to be big award winner.,1442361600,,519,3.9615384615384617

3620972,5,B001GUYAZY,"What else can anyone say?  It's a classic for a reason.  Frank Capra deserved to become the superstar director who was elected president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in addition to winning the Oscar with this great romantic comedy.  The tension between Gable and Lombard keeps us enthralled and the eventual growth of their romantic feelings for one another are handled with gentle loving care.  The plot twists toward the end allow for depth of character, for a clash of personalities and the eventual admission that these two characters belong together.  The Capra style is well fortified, and perfected here and he'll go on to make more great films such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's a Wonderful Life.  Even his war time documentaries are entertaining.",1441152000,,788,4.931818181818182

Well, besides everything you'd expect from a classic film this is also a (Hollywood glazed) window with a view into Depression Era America, an America still working on embracing motorized transportation and motor lodges. There are also stereotypes and a typical nod to wealth at a time when many didn't possess a job, but there are also glimpses into real people. What was classic has now become classic and historical. It's also still a lot of fun. This is Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert at their best.",1435968000,,544,4.7368421052631575

3621031,5,B001GUYAZY,I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times. Still enjoy it. It is a bit dated but in the best of ways. All of the characters are painted with broad strokes but that is the charm. I still think Claudette is a hottie and I'm betting Mr. Gable still can thrum a few heart strings as well.  I love the helicopter plane (autogyro?) at the end too. I can't believe anyone ever went to the trouble to build something like that! Looks like it would fair better as a high volume guillotine. :),1434585600,,490,4.157894736842105

3621101,5,B001GUYAZY,"It Happened One Night might be the best of the old black and white studio classics. If you like the genre and have somehow missed this movie, you should definitely check this one out.

Starting with a fantastic, funny, fast moving script and great chemistry between the leads, the movie also has wonderful, hilarious set pieces (Clark Gable narrating as he takes off his clothes in front of Claudette Colbert, Gable carrying her across a stream, and many more). Without feeling tacked on, the movie also deals deftly with issues of class and poverty. At several points, it is so clear that this is a movie set in Depression Era America, and that makes it deeper and richer. Some reviewers have criticized now old-fashioned attitudes. If you are troubled by sexism (even in older movies) or hints at violence (nothing on screen), this may not be for you, but if you can accept flawed characters who are very much of their time, watch this movie!",1430092800,,944,4.721212121212122

I guess you treat all the rest as build-up to that conclusion.  Characterizations could be deeper.  I did like the father.  At first he seemed snobbish and domineering then as things progress he looks more capable and reasonable.  By the end he even shows touches of humor, wisdom and generosity.  I wish I could say the same about Colbert's and Gable's characters.  Still, the movie is entertaining.  Throughout it provides a view (real or imagined) into the time period with interesting contrasts to today.

Great pairing for these two hollywood ""Greats"" Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable.  Doesn't get any better.

The plot is quaint by today's standards but it's a hoot to see them ride the bus all night to get from Miami to Gainesville :) Funny, it just occurred to me that Clark Gable and Sean Connery share that same quality of dopey masculinity.

3621301,5,B001GUYAZY,It's so hard to believe that this movie is over eighty years old. I still find it as entertaining as any modern day romantic comedy.

3621368,1,B001GUYAZY,"Are you kidding me?  This was a ridiculous story of a weak girl getting pushed around by her father, husband and suitor!  Father slaps her, she runs away, throws herself at another man although she's already married and gets threatened by the violent jerk the whole movie!  He puts her down the whole time for who she is - but of course, she's going to fall for the bad guy.  I am a HUGE movie buff and I LOVE old movies especially Harvey, The Women (original), Casablanca and many others but I am just FLOORED that this is what people think is a ""cute"" love story???  OMG, highly disappointed.  I write very few reviews but was so surprised by the reviews and ratings of this movie that I almost think I must have seen a different movie than all these people....sorry, but I had to put my 2 cents in for what it's worth....probably not much because it looks like I am HUGELY in the minority here.",1424131200,,897,4.341317365269461

3621370,5,B001GUYAZY,"It was by far the sweetest love story I've ever seen, and it's mainly because I can relate to Peter in a way most people probably can't. Right after watching the movie, I went ahead and changed my avatar and cover photo on a anonymous social media to pictures of the memorable moments that happened in the movie. It's crazy because I never thought I'd enjoy a black&white movie this much, but now I'd probably watch a lot more earlier classics after this one. I CANNOT stretch this enough - how much I loved this movie. The culture back then amuses me, it made me think that I was born in the wrong era. The curtain Peter puts up shows enormous respect for the girl. Fast forward to the present world, where twerking is endorsed & worshiped, having a relationship that is pure and innocent at its core is just THAT much harder.",1423440000,,827,4.411764705882353

3621395,5,B001GUYAZY,"I finally watched IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT after seeing the iconic scene a number of times that featured Claudette Colbert hitch-hiking with Clark Gable and using her leg to get a car to stop. Now I see why this is considered a classic and why it swept the Oscars.

If you haven't seen the film, Colbert plays a spoiled heiress who is on the run --rebelling from her father-- and she crosses path with Gable portraying a reporter; they meet on a night bus to NYC and one thing leads to another and suddenly they fall for one another.

The beauty in this story is the fun that audiences get to share in as the characters go along the journey from being indifferent and almost hostile toward one another to falling in love and that's what makes it a classic. Supposedly IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT was the film that started the genre of the ""romantic/screwball comedy"" and the chemistry between Colbert and Gable is spot on.

This new CRITERION BLURAY edition of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT also comes with a bunch of extras that should keep fans happy and has been digitally restored. I was reading another review that said the Blu-ray's picture quality was on par with the DVD release and since I haven't seen that version I can't comment on it, but the image on BR looks good to me considering that this movie is from 1934.

The blacks are black, the image is sharp and clear, and there aren't any visible dust/hair/scratches that I can see.

*****  EXTRAS  *****

""Frank Capra, Jr. Remembers"" -- featurette (11:16-min/ 1999)
Son of director Frank Capra discuses how the movie came about (it was based on a short story called ""Night Bus"") and was filmed in four weeks.

""Screwball Comedy?"" -- featurette (38:36-min/ 2014)
Film critics Molly Haskell and Phillip Lopate talk about the film and how it came to signify the genre of the ""screwball comedy"" and they also discuss Capra's filming techniques.

""Fulta Fisher's Boarding House"" -- silent short film (12:03-min/ 1921)
Capra's first movie that was based on a story/ballad by Rudyard Kipling.

""Frank Capra's American Dream"" -- documentary (01:36:02-min/ 1997)
Hosted and narrated by director Ron Howard this full length documentary shows Capra from his humble beginnings to becoming a  powerful director/story teller. And it shows the ugly side of America's past as Capra was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy witch hunts. It also talks about Frank's last movie he directed (which was a remake of his own ""Lady For a Day"" and that was ""Pocketful Of Miracles"") and it's ironic for me because this remake starring Bette Davis was the movie that introduced me to Frank Capra. He became disillusioned with Hollywood and making films because the studios no longer trusted the director and all movies were now being star driven -- in this case it was Glenn Ford who was calling the shots, I don't know why since I never saw Ford as that big of a star or money maker -- and the ""star"" was basically telling the director how to make the movie. Another interesting note is that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was not a commercial success when it was released, only to be rediscovered years after, which  would then become the great Christmas classic we all know now.

""AFI - American Film Institute - Tribute To Capra"" --  special (59:11-min/ 1982)
From its 10th anniversary, the AFI salutes Frank Capra and features many of the Hollywood greats that starred in his movies including Bette Davis, Jimmy Stewart, Claudette Colbert, and Peter Falk. There are also many other celebrity cameos as they reminisce and talk about Capra who was present with his wife and children and grand kids. I must say that I was impressed with Colbert's speech: she went up on the stage and gave a touching recollection of working with Frank and Gable and IHON and she did so without cue cards and no teleprompter (most of the other celebs on stage including Davis and Stewart used cards which is why I noticed).

3621402,4,B001GUYAZY,"This is one of my favorite movies.  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled heiress trying to get from Florida to New York without being stopped by her father, and Clark Gable is the wise-cracking newspaper man who decides to help her get to New York so he can sell her story.  This is one of the first romantic comedies, and is arguably the first time the leading man also provided the comic relief.  It's very watchable, very funny, and its influence can be seen in nearly every romantic comedy made since 1935.

Having recently watched the Criterion Collection DVD of Gold Rush (1925) (which looks amazing), I had high hopes for It Happened One Night's transfer to blu ray.  The first several minutes are a vast improvement to the DVD.  The water looked amazing, for example.  Unfortunately, there are still a lot of sound issues and fuzzy images.  For example when Clark Gable yells, ""Quit bawling!"" the audio has the same feedback as my DVD copy.  And there are several scenes that seem out of focus/fuzzy, or the picture gets a bit washed out or a little too dark, and I swear I could still hear a hiss in a couple of the late night scenes.  I know there's only so much they can do to restore these old negatives, but it seemed like they only attempted to restore the first fifteen minutes or so and gave up.

The blu ray is also missing a handful of special features that are on my DVD (the vintage ads, the live radio re-broadcast, talent files, and Frank Capra, Jr's commentary track).  There are new special features on the blu ray, but I'll be keeping my old DVD copy in order to retain the old special features.

All in all, I'm happy that I bought the Criterion Collection blu ray, but only because I adore this movie so much.  I would recommend people with a casual interest in this film to simply get the DVD since the picture and sound are nearly identical (to me).",1420502400,,1872,4.451612903225806

The quality is not in the same league as Casablanca or  The Man Who Knew Too Much, which even with the Criterion's DVD is excellent.

3621434,5,B001GUYAZY,"""I just finished the worst picture in the world!"" Claudette Colbert told a friend while preparing for her vacation. She was talking about ""It Happened One Night""(1934) and although she didn't think much of the picture or it's director(Frank Capra), of all the films she made during her career it's the one she is most associated with. Her role as the spoiled heiress Ellen Andrews won her the Best Actress Oscar in 1934 and the film itself is now considered a classic. Just in time for it's 80th Anniversary, Criterion has now brought this romantic comedy to Blu-ray for the first time and it has never looked better. According to the liner notes: """"This new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution from a 35 mm safety composite fine-grain made from the original nitrate negative and a 35 mm nitrate print."" Those who own the standard DVD from the ""Frank Capra Collection"" from 2006 will notice a  difference in the picture quality as it is much brighter with a pleasing contrast throughout. Despite an extensive restoration by Sony(who owns the Columbia catalog) in 2013, there are still some scenes and frames where the elements show some fading with visible grain present. This is understandable for a film that's 80 years old. However, there are no vertical lines, dirt, white specks or torn frames and the majority of the film looks excellent and nearly pristine. Criterion has given ""It Happened One Night"" a bitrate of 24.11 and the cinematography by Joseph Walker is really highlighted now in Blu-ray. This is very noticeable in the daylight scenes. The newspaper headlines that appear throughout the film are very easy to read and you can easily see the costumes, sets and other props compared to the standard DVD. The audio(LMCM English Mono) has been improved also. Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original nitrate optical soundtrack and a 35 mm nitrate print.""  Almost everyone who's seen the film knows the story so I won't go over it except to say that although both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert didn't think much of it at the time they have a great chemistry whenever they're on screen together(Opposites attract). Even though it's a romantic comedy, Capra and writer Robert Riskin do make some comments on the Depression and it's affect on people in the scene in which a mother faints from malnutrition having spent all her money on the bus fare for her and her son. Even after 80 years, this is a powerful scene. ""It Happened One Night"" is 105 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Criterion has added a lot of special features. There is a documentary on Frank Capra from 1997 about the director's life and career as well as the American Film Institute tribute from 1982. Also included is a new digital transfer of Capra's first film, the 1921 silent short ""Fultah Fisher's Broarding House."" Also included are commentaries from film critics Molly Haskell and Phillip Lopate as well as an interview with Frank Capra Jr. ""It Happened One Night"" is a classic American film from one of the great directors in cinema. Now that it's been given the Criterion treatment it should be essential to any film collector's library and comes very highly recommended.",1416268800,,3290,4.904847396768402
3621435,5,B001GUYAZY,"Wonderful old classic movie made during a time when we had real actors and actresses that knew how to act and give an entertaining performance without bareing their T&A, using foul language or humping throughout the movie.

3621439,5,B001GUYAZY,Not only is this film a great movie it is also the archetype for all romantic comedies.  The first of only three films ever to win all five of the major Oscars at the Academy Awards this Frank Capra film is highly entertaining and timeless. Clark Gable and Colette Colbert shine as a miss-matched pair of travelers each with their own agenda yet find their different destinations completely intertwined.

In that sense it is very, very well done.  It reminds me of a marshmallow toasted to perfection over a campfire:  easy to enjoy, easy to praise, and not very nourishing.

3621475,5,B001GUYAZY,Best romantic movie ever. Rich girl always gets what she want and goes through great lengths to get it. The guy thinks she is a spoiled brat but winds up falling for her.

3621477,5,B001GUYAZY,"I purchased this to rent on Amazon Prime. All I can say is that I watched it 3 times during the 24 hour span I had for the rental. They definitely don't make movies like this anymore. ""It Happened One Night"" was just superb and one of my most favorite ""romantic comedies"" of all time. It is smart and charming from beginning to end. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert have this amazing chemistry throughout the film that draws you into the story and connects you to the characters. Frank Capra is a master in bringing this story to the screen. I love his movies. I laughed, cried and just couldn't tear myself away until I finished watching it. It's amazing how this 1930s film can still capture my heart every time I see it.",1402272000,,724,4.41044776119403
3621478,5,B001GUYAZY,"This is a little movie, but so sweet, and back in the day it surprised Colbert + Gable when it won awards.  No one expected it to be so popular.  It's interesting to look back on the post-Depression years and see how normal it was for regular folks to be taking the bus.  Going to live with relatives, migrating North to look for work. Nowadays the interior of a Greyhound is pretty intimidating.  Also interesting that the U.S. was still so very green.  Need a bed for the night?  A big, clean haystack will do nicely.  Going to a motel?  This one is draped with vines and edged by huge trees.  In fact, fields and huge trees figure largely in the landscape of ""One Night"".  The story is great, as are the actors, and I particularly liked the editor of Gable's paper.  Especially the scene where they have a quick heart-to-heart, and Gable wonders ""Where am I?"" as he heads off for a little drunkathon, funded by his boss.",1401580800,,923,4.402366863905326

This is my favorite Clark Gable performance:  tough and smart on the outside, but a difficult-to-reach tender side, even though he wears his integrity and honesty on his sleeve.  The character is a lot like Rhett Butler.  I get the feeling that this is who Gable really was.  Colbert is perfect as the classy ""ditz"" who's actually witty and intelligent, but she just hasn't gotten out much due to her over-privileged and overprotected background.  Watch this!  These endearing and unforgettable characters will win you over.  You'll love it!",1398816000,,714,5.184210526315789
3621485,5,B001GUYAZY,"A true best picture.  Interesting enough Claudette Colbert did not wish to be in it and thought it not good when completed. But sShe got best actress and the film won best picture. Clark Gable had a great time making it.  He also won an Oscar.  It is a fun movie from  start to finish with a most pleasing ending.  And it set some trends from Bugs Bunny eating a carrot in a fashion similar to the Gable figure in the film to men shying away from undershirts as Clark does not wear one.
Shared the movie with a young friend who likes classic film (does not mind B & W) and he also liked it a lot.  Thus, it appeals to some, at least, of a new generation.

It is simply wonderful entertainment. I confess to liking old films very much. One of the many reasons for doing so is that so many of them were character driven and dialogue rich and had human actors playing parts and reacting with each other. I don't mind the occasional computer generated and special effects heavy piece of nonsense, but I really do love films about people. Whatever one may say about the old Hollywood and its contract players and ""star"" system it certainly produced some commanding screen presences. None more so than Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. Both are great and Claudette is my absolute favourite Cleopatra in Cecil B DeMille's film of that name. I wrote that up too. The interaction here between Clark and Claudette is wonderfully watchable. This may be an old film but the quality is superb and the story is engaging and the two of them are a treat. Get it I say.",1391385600,,1064,4.634920634920635

3621514,4,B001GUYAZY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Road trip escapism at it's best despite a crowded long haul bus, Go Greyhound! Still trying to assess who is who in this early debut of the RomCom. Going with Clark on the ""Thelma"" role who shows his weakness for drink in the opening scene, and his desperate pursuit of adventure to leave his dismal, unappreciated career life far behind and makes it happen. ""Louise"" is definitely all about Colbert because she finally decides to take supreme measures to leave her insipid, mundane life for anywhere but here attitude. However, her scheme falls apart by end scene as she succumbs to predictable married life. Or perhaps it's the other way around?? Either way, no canyon crossing here!

The Walls of Jericho analogy is probably lost more so on current viewers which dilutes much of the sweet and delightful truimphant notes. Colbert's system of hitchhiking was the highlight of the production. The Haye's Code, most likely in force, was compromised to see a skirt hitched thigh high with that perfect gam and ensuing end result, hilarious!

I kept seeing Julia Roberts in ""Runaway Bride"" in the final scene with her wedding train flowing through the meadows to an escape vehicle. So many other films to mention based on these characterizations, plot lines, and script devices that lead credence to the viability of Capra's vision and use of erratic, crazy, convoluted elements. Great PR for romance on the road, Clark's attempt to be theee MAN in charge (LOL) and an actual AeroGyro demo. Delicious entertainment!",1389657600,,1555,4.973076923076923

Gable is great (as always?) but Colbert may be one of the all time greats. She has a range of emotions second to none (watch her in Drums Along the Mohawk). This genre gave Cary Grant a new direction, Bringing Up Baby, Holiday. Another great, Willam Powell in Her Man Godfrey and The Thin Man series with another great Myrna Loy. There is no best, just all these films are great.",1389139200,,501,4.397849462365591

3621520,5,B001GUYAZY,"When spoiled millionaire heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) jumps off her father's yacht, reporters are on the trail for the hottest newspaper story!  She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down-on-his luck reporter Peter Warren, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other.  Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and ""Westley,"" the weasel husband she married in haste who is only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with a  fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards!  The scene in which they are stranded off the road and Peter teaches ""Brat"" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking is funny as he fails miserably, until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Freleng and Chuck jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny!  ""It happened one Night"" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best.  This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated so many famous scenes from ""It Happened One Night.""  With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds.  This is a classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellies' father closes in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear.  ""It Happened One Night"" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture.  It should be part of everyone's movie collection.  It was released on January 1st, 1934 and after 80 years, ""It Happened One Night"" is still fresh, funny and a classic screwball comedy!",1388793600,,2501,4.73963133640553

3621522,5,B001GUYAZY,"THE STORY: Spoiled rotten heiress runs away from home to avoid marriage to a man she doesn't really love. A down on his luck newspaper reporter smells a story, tracks the girl down and sticks with her. In the process, the two find hatred turning to begruding respect and finally deep love. Will the snooty little rich girl follow her heart and stay with this rough & tumble guy... or will she go where the money is in order to make her family happy?

THOUGHTS: Not much to say about this wonderful old romantic screwball comedy that hasn't been said many times before. It's just about perfect. Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert are absolutely splendid in their roles, as are the solid cast of supporting players. It's just a joy to watch this delightful film play out. It just never gets old. Surprisingly enough, the excellent ""Making of"" featurette on the DVD paints a murky, troubling story about the clash of personalities and conflicts behind the scenes. The movie almost seemed destined to never get made. Thank goodness everything that went on in front of the lens was pure gold! 5 Academy Awards proves its excellence and a good old fashioned romance never really goes out of style. Even though so much has changed from the time period in which this gem was filmed, romance and men & women have actually changed very little. Treat yourself and buy this movie! Watch it alone or, even better, with the one you love. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT belongs in every true movie fan's collection.

THE DVD: Good transfer. Solid blacks & mid-tones and minimal print damage here. Sound mix is level and solid. Extras include the above-mentioned behind-the-scenes featurette. Well worth watching if you enjoy the film and movies in general. There are at least three DVD versions. I don't have the Criterion Blu-ray... yet. A 5 STAR film, regardless of format.",1387756800,,1848,4.771875

3621528,5,B001GUYAZY,"I have been on something of a tear recently attempting to delve into the 1930s and 1940s section of the American Songbook, you know, the Benny Goodman, Peggy Lee, Bing, Frank, Andrews Sisters, Billie Holiday, Dorsey Brothers, Harry James, Doris Day, Mills Brothers, Inkspots music that guided the generation that survived the Great Depression (1930s variety, not today's close cousin) and World War II. What now is essentially roots music. The purpose of that exercise was to put together an idea of how those then youngsters survived the great wants of 1930s, the hunger wants, and how they sloshed through the war, rifle on a shoulder or waiting by the fireside for Johnny's return through the music they heard. The music that would help make them forget the hungers for a minute, would make them not worrying about the dark war days ahead in some unknown land, or fret waiting by some lonely fireside. In short music to make them sing, laugh, jitter-bug to ease the pressure of existence.

Of course music in the mid- 20th century, or now, is not the only way to alleviate those kinds of pressures as the film under review, Frank Capra's It Happened One Night makes clear. Film, as those elegant filled matinee theaters of the 1930s testified to, could help as well. Especially comedies, better yet romantic comedies, screwball or otherwise, since that genre was what drew the young women in, and in their trail the young men. And the kings of this goldmine were one Preston Sturgis and the director here, Frank Capra. This one had all the bells and whistles back in the day.

The plotline here is pretty conventional. Spoiled brat over-indulged daughter (played by Claudette Colbert) decides to make a jail-break from her pampered life and marry a guy her father does not like. She makes that point clear by jumping off her father's yacht in Florida determined to get to her man in New York come hell or high water. And so she is off, off by bus of all things, heading north. Needless to say that over-indulgent father is beside himself to get his daughter back on the straight and narrow and will move heaven and earth (with much dough thrown in) to do so. So our gal is a marked woman.

On that plebeian bus though said daughter runs into a rogue news reporter, a guy who has seen it all and has survived, oh yeah, and is handsome and sexy too, 1930s handsome and sexy, and maybe by today's standard's too (played by Clark Gable). So our trusty reporter is going grease the skids for our brat so she can get back to the big city and her man. All he wants is an exclusive story. But you do not put a sexy guy like Clark Gable, rogue reporter or not, and a fetching gal like Claudette Colbert, brat or not, together just to ease her way to some wastrel gold-digger, male version. So you know, you know if you know Hollywood, 1930s Hollywood, and today too come to think of it, that they are destined by the stars above to fall for each other. Simple plot, no question, but the play by play of how they get to that falling in love part is why this one ran the table, won five major Academy awards, back in the day. And made people forget for a couple of hours those hungers out on the streets. Enough said.",1384041600,,3209,4.510309278350515

Clark Gable gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a loveable newspaper reporter who helps a runaway heiress(Claudette Colbert) who is trying to escape from an unhappy home life.

3621537,4,B001GUYAZY,"This is the grandparent of all romantic comedies, and it was the movie that established Frank Capra as a major director, Columbia Pictures as a major studio, and Clark Gable as a top box-office draw. An enormous crowd-pleaser, it became the runaway hit of 1934 and swept all four major Oscar categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress - an achievement unmatched for over 40 years. It also won for Best Adapted Screenplay, taken as it was from a short story called ""Night Bus to New York."" Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert), a spoiled and unhappy heiress, escapes the lavish imprisonment of her father's yacht to reunite with the husband she married just to spite her domineering father (Walter Connolly). She is helped in a cross-country chase by Peter Warne (Gable), a wily reporter who has fallen on hard times and needs a blockbuster story to save his career. It Happened One Night has been imitated many times, but none of the remakes has ever approached its wit and appeal. Two scenes remain classics: one where Gable proposes to sleep in the same room with Colbert separated only by a blanket folded across a clothesline, and the other where Colbert demonstrates her very effective method of hitchhiking. The sly Connolly is terrific as Ellen's father, and watch for Ward Bond, who played Bert the cop in It's a Wonderful Life, and Alan Hale, Sr., whose son played the Skipper on the ""Gilligan's Island"" TV series, in minor roles.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1377475200,,1713,5.541984732824427

She, in turn, runs away and catches a bus to New York City to be reunited with the man she married.  The frantic father offers a huge money reward to the person who can find her.

Colbert feels stuck in her life with a domineering father who does not approve of her marriage, and so she runs off to get away. While on a bus she meets the recently fired Peter (Gable) and there is immediate friction between them. However, realizing she is inexperienced, Peter watches out for her and they travel together. Finding out who she is, he is even more driven to get a story and stay with her. Along the way Colbert begins to fall in love but he does not immediately react. When he finally realizes his true feelings, the situation becomes complicated when Colbert returns to her father and fiancee. In the midst of the wedding she hears of Peter's true love and runs off to him. By that evening they are married and the ""walls of Jericho"" come tumbling down.

It swept the Oscars in 1935 -- Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for acting and Frank Capra for directing, and all were richly deserved. as was Robert Riskin's for adapting a short story by Samuel Hopkins Adams (whoever he may be) into a script crackling with wit and intelligence.  If you're like me, you want to know as little as possible about a movie before you see it (I just want to know whether it's worth seeing or not!).  However, if you've read any reviews of this movie you know it begins with a runaway heiress running into a recently fired reporter.  And that's all I'll reveal here.  You'll just have to take my word for it: the plot moves along swiftly, the dialogue is inventive and at times wildly funny, and the performances are first-rate, including those of the second-tier and even third-tier characters.  The chemistry between Gable and Colbert reminds me of that between Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in ""The African Queen"".  Even the basic premises of these two films are in fact similar: two ""completely different"" sorts of characters are thrown together by fate and, well, they're romantic comedies, so you pretty much know how they're going to end.

3621581,4,B001GUYAZY,"It Happened One Night (Frank Capra, 1934, 105')

This movie set the pace for the ""screwball"" comedy, the witty and romantic clash of temperaments between a man and a woman mismatched in both personality and social position, a type of movie often associated with Katherine Hepburn in such classics as Bringing Up Baby (1938) and The Philadelphia Story (1940), among others. (Paul Brenner, Rovi)

In It Happened One Night, a pampered socialite (Claudette Colbert) tries to get out from under her father's (Walter Connolly) thumb, and falls in love with a roguish reporter (Clark Gable). The plot was based on the August 1933 short story Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams, which provided the shooting title. It Happened One Night was one of the last romantic comedies created before the MPAA began enforcing the 1930 production code in 1934.

Neither Gable nor Colbert were the first choices to play the lead roles. Miriam Hopkins first rejected the part of Ellie. Robert Montgomery and Myrna Loy were then offered the roles, but each turned the script down, though Loy later noted that the final story as filmed bore little resemblance to the script that she and Montgomery had been offered for their perusal.

It Happened One Night made an immediate impact on the public. In one scene, Gable undresses for bed, taking off his shirt to reveal that he is bare-chested. An urban legend claims that, as a result, sales of men's undershirts declined noticeably. The movie also prominently features a Greyhound bus in the story, spurring interest in bus travel nationwide.

Joseph Stalin was a fan of the film, as was Adolf Hitler. Whatever that may mean today.

In this movie they have buses and motor lodges (motels), but not the type most people would recognize. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert do an excellent job in this movie and this movie is well worth seeing!! Buy it today!!",1344988800,,349,4.46875
3621584,4,B001GUYAZY,"Clark Gable plays reporter Peter Warne. Claudette Colbert plays spoiled rich girl Ellie Andrews. She married playboy aviator King Westley on a whim, but her father interrupted the ceremony before the marriage was consummated and had it annulled. Ellie was being held captive on her father's yacht so she could not go to Westley, but she jumped overboard and swam away. She made it to a bus terminal (somewhere in the south; I don't remember where) and onto a bus on which was Peter Warne, reporter tracking her for the story he needs to get back in the good graces of his editor.

Peter agrees to help her get to New York while evading the detectives her father has set on her trail, figuring he has a great exclusive story on his hands. When they are forced by the weather and washed-out roads to stay in a motel, he registers them as Mr. & Mrs. Warne to save money, and they hang a blanket between the twin beds in the room. This blanket routine, actually used several times in the course of the trip, is referred to as the ""Walls of Jericho.""

This is a Frank Capra film, so of course Ellie and Peter fall in love. They do their best to deny it, fighting like they hated each other, but the audience is not fooled, and eventually, neither is Ellie's father. And since it's a Capra film, you know that eventually Ellie and Peter end up married to each other. How that comes about is one of the all-time classic romantic comedies.

I saw it long ago on late-night TV, but I think it must have been bowdlerized. There are some very cute slightly sexy humor here, and I don't think I appreciated it. I must have been very young indeed, or as I say, perhaps it had been censored for TV.",1336780800,,1684,4.373801916932908

3621593,5,B001GUYAZY,"Of course, it was inevitable that once there was such a thing as the Academy Awards, that sooner or later,  one film would come along that would capture all five major awards (Best Picture,  Best Director,  Best Actor,  Best Actress and Best Screenplay).  In point of fact,  the Awards had only been existence for five years (the first ceremonies being held in May of 1929) before IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT happened along and scarfed all five of the ""Big Five"" awards in 1934.  It was a feat that would not be duplicated until 1975 (with ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST)--and not ""triplicated"" until 1992 (with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS).

It may say something the state of cinematic art--to say nothing of critical standards-- in 1934 that a much beloved comedy would take home all five major awards.  The two subsequent films to achieve ""five for five"" status  were much darker--although CUCKOO'S NEST certainly had its comic moments.

Movie buffs of the present day will find much to love in this classic Frank Capra comedy,  but they may have to find themselves readjusting their own critical standards and expectations.  By contemporary standards,  IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT looks and sounds ""lo-tech"" and low budget.  And perhaps even more foreign to our 21st century sensibilities is the film's noticeably leisurely pace.  Consider the famous scene in which several passengers on an all-night bus sing the then popular novelty number ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" in full,  with different singers alternating verses and the entire bus joining in on the chorus.  No filmmaker today would take up that much screentime  in  non-musical film to devote to the performance of a single ditty.  More likely--if the song were included in full at all--we'd cut away ASAP to some oh-so-important dialogue or some visually compelling action,  whatever it takes to move the plot along.

Clark and Claudette make for a rare comedic team.  As with most film classics, it's hard to imagine anyone else in those roles.  So it's fascinating to learn that Claudette Cobert was, by most counts, the sixth actress considered for the role of the spoiled, runaway heiress, and SHE turned it down at first.  She had worked with Capra before, and the two hadn't gotten along: but after winning the Oscar, she publicly expressed her gratitude to the director for seeing the project through.  And Robert Montgomery was considered for the role of the savvy but principled reporter who pursues a hot story, reluctantly puts up with his subject's bratty behavior--and just as reluctantly winds up falling for her.

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is one of the classic ""screwball comedies,""  a genre which occasionally revived in contemporary cinema (usually in a very self-conscious--and often quite clumsy--way).  The name ""screwball comedy"" suggests sheer zaniness (with at least one character who is an obvious screwball).  That interpretation, while logical enough, is actually quite limited.  The screwball films of the Depression era were characterized by class differences (with snooty upper class characters getting something of a ""comedownance"" and learning a thing or two about how real folk live and survive.  It never quite amounts to actual ""class warfare"":  call it more ""class bickering.""",1319500800,,3264,5.084745762711864

Directed by Frank Capra

Rebellious socialite Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) marries King Wesley (Jameson Thomas) but her wealthy father has it annulled. Tired of her father's (Walter Connolly) control, she runs away by diving off the family yacht in Miami and heading for New York. On the bus she meets street-smart reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). They end up traveling together as Warne hopes to get a great story, and Ellie needs his worldly help. Nearing New York, with their many adventures coming to an end, they find that they are reluctantly in love and afraid to admit it to each other.

After she mistakenly thinks that Warne has run out on her Ellie returns to King Wesley, but for how long?
Claudette Colbert only accepted because Capra promised he would double her salary and she would be done in four weeks. She disliked the film so much she didn't even attend the Oscars; when she won for Best Actress she was found about to leave on a trip and was rushed to the ceremony, where she made her acceptance speech in a traveling suit.

Oscar Winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Clark Gable), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Claudette Colbert), Best Director
(Frank Capra), Best Picture (Columbia Pictures), Best Writing, Adaptation (Robert Riskin)

* Special Footnote: -- In 1996, Steven Spielberg anonymously purchased Clark Gable's Oscar to protect it from further commercial exploitation, gave it back to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, commenting that he could think of ""no better sanctuary for Gable's only Oscar than the Motion Picture Academy"".  ** Claudette Colbert was so convinced that she would lose the Oscar to write-in nominee Bette Davis that she didn't attended the ceremony originally. She was summoned from a train station to pick up her Academy Award.

** Another Special Footnote: -- Robert Montgomery turned down the male lead, saying the script was the worst thing he had ever read.  ** Myrna Loy turned down the role of Ellie Andrews because a recent film set on a bus had failed, and she didn't think that this one would succeed.

3621597,5,B001GUYAZY,"A very enjoyable romantic comedy with an unusual role for Clark Gable, who normally had played great romantic leading man, here plays a drunk, cigar-smoking, wisecracking newsreporter.  Claudette Colburn as the sassy, spoiled rich brat who runs away from her father to see her eloped husband, ""King,"" himself a spoiled rich kid whom her father despises.

The story starts right off with Ellie Andrews jumping off a ship and eventually ending up on a night bus to New York to see ""King.""  In fact ""Night Bus"" was the original title.  Despite the movie title, this story happens over several nights.  Clark Gable's character just got laid off and is drunk.

He plays up to Ellie on the bus and it's quite funny how each does not know the other and they end up in a hotel room together, pretending to be husband and wife.

I won't write out the entire plot, but just a few of my favorite scenes:  When they're hitchhiking, Peter brags about how he can stop any car with his thumb.  Several cars later, Ellie tries by flashing her leg.  Stop!

Peter struggles with his emotions, and when she tells him that she loves him, he tells her callously to go back to bed.  Wow!

Another scene near the end, when each thought the other betrayed, she becomes the runaway bride!  The train trailing off as she runs to the escape car with hundreds of guests and reporters following her is amazing.

Bottom Line:  Funny and at times heartbreaking, the story is a bit dated but at the same time great to see two actors with such chemistry and quick wit.  This film took five Academy Awards which was never done again until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in the 60s.  A must-see film.

This film is now one of my favorite Capra films, along with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's a Wonderful Life.

DVD specials including a radio broadcast of the film (as a radio play of course), several ads and trailers, and an interview with Frank Capra, Jr. on the production and what his father thought of the show.

3621602,5,B001GUYAZY,"Sometimes described as a ""screwball comedy,"" I think that this may be more than that. The chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable on screen in undeniable.

The plot is rather thin. Colbert is running away to join her neer do well husband (her father wants the marriage annulled). Clark Gable is a reporter whose newspaper is, to be charitable, unhappy with him. He recognizes that Colbert is a wealthy man's daughter and sees a story-in-the-making that can assist his career.

Then, the odyssey. . . .  Train, bus, and automobile (not to say hitchhiking). The ""walls of Jericho"" keep them separated when they stay overnight (a blanket between them, to keep them apart--and chaste).

Of course, the two begin to have feelings for one another. Colbert begins to wonder about her husband.

The movie rushes ahead. The ending is preposterous but quite satisfying!

A classic movie that holds up reasonably well so many years later.",1291420800,,939,4.987179487179487
3621603,5,B001GUYAZY,"There is something about the classic acting styles of the actors in the older films that bring to life the stories and unfolding dramas. This is no exception. You will be riveted to the screen, sharing in the intense emotions and laughs.",1287360000,,237,4.666666666666667
3621604,5,B001GUYAZY,"75 years after its initial release, this film is still a pleasure to watch.  It's as funny and charming today as it was back in 1934, when it won Best Picture and several other Academy Awards.  This is probably the first really great romantic comedy ever made, just a few years after the silent picture era.  What makes this film stand out (like most great films) is the writing brought to life with great performances.  The screenplay is excellent- funny, real, briskly paced, authentic.  And the leading actors- Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert- both turned in the best performances of their careers in this movie.  The result is a first-rate romantic comedy loaded with funny and memorable scenes.  Some stand outs:

- Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in their motor-camp room arguing when the detectives arrive to throw them off.
- The hitch-hiking scene with Colbert 'showing' Gable how it's done.
- The first scene with Gable getting fired on the phone but showing off to his buddies.
- Gable the gangster and 'Shapely'
- Gable telling Colbert about being a good piggy-backer.

But most of all the on-going dialogue between Gable and Colbert really entertains all the way through the movie. Funny, authentic, and entertaining from beginning to end.  Beyond that, there are period moments that really stand out and make the movie authentic without being dated.  The scene where the mother collapses on the bus next to her son is very touching without being over-the-top and reminds us that this is the depression; and the scene with Colbert walking through the motor-camp to the shower also gives a glimpse of real life at the time while being funny too.

The only negative I would add regarding this movie is the picture/audio quality on the DVD, which is not as good as some others of this era.  Generally, there is a bit of a drop-off in quality for movies in the early to mid-30s compared to late-30s.  In that regard, you can tell this is a 1934 film.  The DVD is a significant improvement over the VHS, particularly the video improvement.  If you like movies from this era, however, the quality issues are not a huge distraction by any means.  But, the soundtrack is a little scratchy and the video a little more grainy than some other DVDs of this era.

The general plot-line from this film has been imitated frequently over the years, equalled once perhaps (Roman Holiday) but never bested.  I am looking forward to the Blu-ray edition of this film, which I imagine will greatly improve both audio and video quality of what I consider one of the top 5 or so romantic comedies ever made (along with The Philadelphia Story, Roman Holiday, When Harry Met Sally, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill) and one of the best movies of all time.",1285027200,,2756,4.740041928721174
3621605,5,B001GUYAZY,"This is Claudette Colbert's signature comedy movie, in fact she won an Academy award for it.  It is actually sometimes while watching it hard to believe how old the movie is because it is still extremely fresh and entertaining.",1280275200,,227,4.82051282051282
3621606,5,B001GUYAZY,The combination of Clark Gables' charm and Claudette Colberts' comedy genius is a thing of greatness. Never has a bus ride been so fun their chemistry was magnetic and is perhaps one of the best romantic comedies of all time. This legendary film was a mix of serious comedy about two people on a train one a reporter looking for the next big story and the other a priveliged daughter of a wealthy bank who is trying to escape to live her own life. What starts out as a stern conversation leads to a whirlwind romance with comedy from beginning to end. A must see,1279670400,,562,4.3619047619047615

3621608,5,B001GUYAZY,"In another review I called ""Pillow Talk"" one of the seminal films in the development of romantic comedies as we know, understand, and love them.

""It Happened one Night"" is its predecessor and partner.

Although this film virtually swept the Oscars, it was made virtually by accident. No one liked the project. Clark Gable was banished to the film as a punishment, and I'm quite sure that in 1934 Frank Capra was not looked upon with the high regard his films enjoy today.

Yet everything came together in this ""bus movie"", as it was derisively called pre-production, and a charming, funny, and moving story unfolded.

Only a few years into ""talkies"", the film set the tone and stage for the antithetical courtship that would become virtually ubiquitous for romantic comedies. Don't believe me? How do you decide who is going to get together at the end of a romantic comedy? Its the two people that early on hate each others' guts, right? Right. Every one of those movies is in some way derivative of ""It Happened One Night"".

Unless you just hate ""old movies"", watch and enjoy. Or if you've already seen it, renew your relationship with the film. It is absolutely worth it.",1277510400,,1174,4.735294117647059

3621614,4,B001GUYAZY,"It Happened One Night is one of those timeless classic comedies you can go back to after watching. It is fitting that this film took home many Academy Awards, being that it has memorable scenes, two major stars who deliver (Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable), well-timed comedy and witty dialog, and, of course, a romantic edge between a mismatched couple. Being a Depression era movie, moviegoers could just sit back and enjoy a film with heart and laughs, and take a break from the economic problems of the day (it's too bad we can't do the same).

The story involves a runaway heiress Ellen Andrews(Colbert) who has designs on marrying King Westley, and has literally jumped ship and taken off in hopes of getting to New York. Clark Gable plays a tough-minded, gruff newspaper reporter who has recently been fired, and happens to be on the same bus as Andrews. Both meet--seemingly on the wrong foot--when they squabble over who gets the last seat in the back of the bus. After exchanging jab after verbal jab at each other during the trip, Peter (Gable) gets word from a newspaper that he is, in fact, sitting next to Andrews. He has his own agenda--being the first one to break the story, and maybe stick it to his former boss--and he wants to take advantage of this. However, there is a sense that, as the two experience conflict after conflict, that they are falling for each other, even though they are as different as can be, and won't admit this.

There are several scenes that stand out as memorable. First, the scene where Peter confronts Ellen, saying he had her ""pegged as a brat"" and ""snob"" from the start is important to the changing of Ellen's character. He is direct with her and lays into what he thinks of ""her kind."" Second, the famous ""hitchhiking"" scene is classic. One of the most memorable scenes in all film, this moment really displays Peter's cockiness. However, Peter is humbled, as nothing he does works to get a car, and this allows Colbert to do her famous ""leg"" scene with the car hitting the brakes. The scene with Ellen gloating-- and Peter sulking-- in the back of the car--all the while the driver singing boisterously loud--is great comedy. It pretty much defines the difference of personality between the two characters.

If there is one blemish in the film, it is that the ending and last part gets a little illogical and silly. Ellen has a chance to change her mind, and seems to be a little bit too lackadaisical about it until the very end. I thought the road trip part of the film was the best (the first hour or so), but that maybe the film lost a little luster towards the end.

Still, for what it's worth, this is a wonderful film, one of those that you can watch if you are in the mood of romantic comedy. It really displays the talents of Clark and Colbert, who have fantastic chemistry, and the exceptional direction from Frank Capra. Not surprisingly, this film took home the five major awards from the Academy Awards, and has been pegged as the standard for ""screwball comedy"", although I think it fits ""romantic comedy"" to a tee.",1268784000,,3079,4.613138686131387

3621616,5,B001GUYAZY,"I must be the only person who likes movies in the wide, wide world who had never seen this screw-ball comedy that was released in 1934 at the height of the Great Depression. Its stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, won Oscars for Best Actress and Best Actor. Its director Frank Capra took home Best Director. Colbert as Ellie Anderson, the spoiled rich girl with the pencil eyebrows, is perfect, as is Clark Gable, the gruff newspaper man Peter Warne with the pencil-thin moustache certainly. These two meet on a cross-country bus trip; and for the possible one other soul who has not seen this film, you suspect what happens. The love bug bites. There is one funny scene after another. In the 1930's if you have to share a bedroom with a stranger, you build the ""Wall of Jerico,"" consisting of a rope with a blanket hanging on it, to provide privacy between the two single beds of course. And if you are Clark Gable, you undress, showing the world that real men do not wear undershirts. Supposedly the fact that the world saw Gable's bare chest set the undershirt manfucturers back big time since it was at least 20 years before Mr. Brando showed the world his famous wife-beater underwear. Of course Colbert showed the world how to hitch a ride-- as she tells Gable, she is tired of hiking and would like to hitch. And everybody loves a wedding even if we have a runaway bride, something that would be done again and again in future films-- think ""The Graduate"" for example.

There are plenty of people hurting in this film, the women lined up to use the bathroom, for instance, when Ellie tries to go to the head of the line. She also finds out what it means to be hungry ahd sleep out under the open sky although she is as fresh and unblemished upon awaking as she was when she bedded down. But you can do that in old movies.

""It Happened One Night"" may have been a pleasant diversion in the difficult year it was released. It still has that same effect in these times when much of the world appears to be going to hell in a wheelbarrow.",1266105600,,2047,4.441489361702128

3621618,5,B001GUYAZY,"It Happened One Night (1934) is a screwball comedy filmed during the depression; it stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable.  The film was directed by the (soon-to-be) infamous Frank Capra in black and white.  Initially looked down upon by its two stars as a sure-flop, both would be surprised when the film swept the Academy Awards.

  The film centers on two characters.  Ellen ""Ellie"" Andrews (Colbert) tries to marry ""King"" Wesley against the wishes of her father before going on the run.  On the way she meets Peter Warne (Gable), a newspaper journalist who without a story is on the verge of being jobless.  Seeing it as the story of his career Warne pursues, but watching her proves difficult given how out of place she is in the depression gripped United States, since she comes from a wealthy family.  Naturally hilarity ensues.

  Contrary to its title, the film takes place over a series of days and nights as this would be couple make their way towards New York City in whatever way they can manage: be it by bus, hitchhiking, or stolen automobile.  Perhaps a better title would have been more along the lines of `On The Run'.  The original short story title of `Night Bus' (written by Samuel Hopkins Adams) could have worked as well, but in the end It Happened One Night was the title that (for whatever reason) stuck.

  It Happened One Night is clearly the inspiration to many future romantic comedies.  The situation of having a man and woman from two separate backgrounds is one of the most beloved norms for comedy, and this is certainly one of the best entries in a seemingly never ending collection of screwball comedies (which vary greatly in quality).  Having good actors like Gable and Colbert as your leads certainly improves the situation of what could otherwise have been (as Gable and Colbert feared) a major flop.  Instead of a career ending flop, It Happened One Night would be the first film to get ""The Big Five"" at the Academy Awards (Best Writing, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Picture).",1264032000,,2040,4.7414772727272725
3621619,5,B001GUYAZY,"This is the original Screwball Comedy.  I learned from the commentary that the reason the dialog was so quick was because Claudette Colbert was promised that the film would be made in 4 weeks and it was a picture that should have taken 6-8 weeks.  There was a rush to do the picture and sets weren't built so everything was filmed on location.  What a fluke that the rush would have created the first screwball comedy!

The first of three films to win the Big 5 Oscars (in addition to One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Silence of the Lambs), It Happened One Night is a quick and charming romantic comedy with an assured Clark Gable and a sweet Claudette Colbert in the leads; it may be a black and white movie made 75 years ago but it'll make you smile today.

3621622,4,B001GUYAZY,"A delightful little comedy, it's easy to see why `It Happened One Night' is still loved, even today.  I can't say that I for one agree with its landing on AFI's `Top 100 Films of All Time', but I can agree with the fact that this sweetly charming (if not standard and clich&eacute;d) tale of love found in all the wrong places is easy to swallow, easy to enjoy and very easy to recommend.

The film tells the story of defiant Ellie, daughter of a very wealthy man who has forbade her recent marriage.  In an act of sheer rebellion, Ellie runs away, traveling to New York to be with her new husband but her father is hot on her tale, trying to force her into an annulment.  On her journey she meets down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter Peter who sees a prime opportunity for a story, and some money.  He offers to accompany Ellie to New York if she gives him exclusive rights to her story, and since she is incapable of really handling the situation alone, she agrees.

Neither of them expected to fall in love, but of course we expect them to.

What is really nice about this film is the undeniable chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.  I am a huge fan of both these faces (especially Colbert, who is stunningly superb in everything I've seen her in) and this film truly showcases their undeniable charm and screen presence.  They play stereotypes (Gable the too-wise-for-his-own-good `macho-man' and Colbert the stubborn yet helpless `damsel'), but they play them to perfection.  This makes their transition from opposites to equals rather effortless and completely believable.

Director Frank Capra really was a masterful director in his day, snapping out masterpiece after masterpiece; and while this is not one of my favorite `Capra Classics' (reserved for his teaming with James Stewart) it certainly is an entertaining and memorable ride.

For me, the faults lie in the initial setup for the film, which is not as sharp as the second half.  Once Ellie hooks up with Peter, and Gable and Colbert establish their relationship, the film picks up quite a bit and actually soars, but it gets off to a slow start for me.

In other words; I wasn't immediately sucked in.

The film ends on a great note though, with Gable and Colbert realizing their character's full potential and creating the formula that would be used and abused in romantic comedies to follow.  It feels fresh here, despite it's overexposure in recent cinema, because of the actors take on the film.  Gable and Colbert (as well as Capra) picked up Oscar's for this film (the film won everything it was nominated for, which included Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor and Actress) and I am delighted since comedies very rarely get recognition from Oscar.  Gable is beyond brilliant here and would most likely be my personal preference for the Oscar as well, but without seeing many films from this year I can't say that I'd go with this particular film in every category.

It's not perfect, but it is very likable and I recommend this one without hesitation.",1253577600,,3042,4.770992366412214

I'd seen IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT on TV a dozen times before I saw the DVD for sale.  It's why I wanted the DVD as soon as I saw it.  But I like to know what kind of value I'm getting for my money.

It deserves better treatment, and will no doubt get it eventually.  Having said this, I recommend buying this DVD anyway and here's why.  The current copyright date on the package is 2008, which means we shouldn't expect the one we really want, with the ""all-new digitally remastered picture"" and ""all-new digital transfer,"" to be available anytime soon.

Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes,  the story gets very stupid.

Here is yet another trivialization of marriage, another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line, mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy, but what the heck, might as well get married, what's the difference?

Huh?

If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the ""road"" part of this film going longer - with Gable and Colbert trading barbs - it would have been super. Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own. She looks really pixie-ish and cute, although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens, another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars.

One of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie: the hitch-hiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a ride....and gets nowhere while Colbert, on her first try, gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.

3621629,4,B001GUYAZY,"Even though it gets lumped in with the other screwball classics of the period, Frank Capra's seminal 1934 comedy seems to have more in mind in studying Depression-era values at the same time it follows the antics of incognito runaway heiress Ellie Andrews and ambitious reporter Peter Warne, who smells a good story in her escape. Written by Robert Riskin, the plot begins with Ellie trapped aboard her wealthy father's yacht in South Florida. With the idea of meeting up with her errant fianc, King Westley, in New York, she makes a run for it by taking a bus where she meets Peter. Unlike other comedies of this ilk (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roman-Holiday/dp/B001EXE2ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roman Holiday</a>), the two lead characters know each other's identity early on, and the rest of the story is about how they forego their prejudices about each other and fall in love.

The early awareness of the characters signals the greater context of the story, which resides in a country awash in economic desperation, whether it's shown through Ellie's aversion to eating raw carrots or at an auto-camp where dozens queue up to take a morning shower. In fact, the class distinction between the pampered Ellie and the world-wise Peter is what makes up most of the laughs, for instance, the memorable hitchhiking and doughnut-dunking lessons and of course, the legendary ""Walls of Jericho"" scene. Considering how the two stars were forced to make the film, both show themselves in top form. As Peter, Clark Gable shows the lighter side of his macho-driven image without upending it, while Claudette Colbert brings her particularly effervescent style to Ellie.

An unforced sexiness permeates the scenes between Gable and Colbert which makes some of the more preposterous story turns more bearable, starting with why Ellie's marital predicament is front-page news. Walter Connolly is in his standard blowhard mode as Ellie's demanding father. A few scenes go on a bit long in typical Capra-corn fashion like the bus sing-along of ""The Daring Young Man in His Flying Trapeze"". However, it's still very worthwhile to see. Kudos to Joseph Walker's luminescent cinematography, especially during the moonlit haystack scene, and to costume designer Robert Kalloch for Ellie's knockout diaphanous wedding gown in the finale. Westley's wedding arrival by ""auto-gyro"", a hybrid between a helicopter and a glider, must have been quite a sight in 1934. The remastered 2008 DVD offers an interesting commentary track by Frank Capra Jr. and a short, ""Frank Capra Jr. Remembers...'It Happened One Night'"".

3621632,5,B001GUYAZY,"Times were hard in 1934 and this light hearted piece of nut cake hit the spot.  It is one of the very few films even nominated and one of only two that won have won all five of the big Oscars: Best Pictures, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay).  All films follow certain standard storylines, but the best ones draw you into their story enough that you stop looking at how it fulfills the requirements of its plot.  This one combines the duck out of water with a road picture and provides a nice touch of confused romance along the way.  Claudette Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, the sheltered, spoiled, and impetuous daughter of a very wealthy and very powerful father who has plans for her life.  As the film opens he is upset with her and trying to make sure she cannot follow through on her plans to marry King Westly (Jameson Thomas) because he does not approve of the man or the match.  She barely knows her fianc, but because her father forbids it she wants it all the more and jumps off the yacht to begin her journey to find Westly and marry him.

Clark Gable plays a barely-ever-was newspaper reporter who likes to drink too much and was just fired from his job.  But he recognizes Ellie Andrews and decides to travel with her and see what kind of a story he can get from her journey to seek her ""true love"".  Of course they start out antagonizing each other and never really admit their growing affection for each other until it all seems too late.  There are many adventures along the way that set up opportunities for gags, for the rich girl to get her comeuppance and realize that the world is full of wonderful people outside her social class.  And Peter Warne (Clark Gable) learns there is more to life than a story and that his cynicism has probably gone too far.

This is a delightful movie and holds up well more than 70 years later.  I think the whole family can enjoy it quite nicely.  Frank Capra pulled it off on a tiny budget in an impossible time frame.  No one thought the picture had a chance, but after it did well and won all those awards, it suddenly found many prophets who had predicted in its success and a large host of people who had contributed to its success.  You know, just like the failure is an orphan adage says.

The DVD has a nice piece with Frank Capra's son telling us what making the film was really like and what it meant to his father.

Enjoy!

3621633,5,B001GUYAZY,"I had only ever seen ""It Happened One Night"" once before, and that was about 20 years ago, in film class at junior college. But I totally loved it. ""It Happened One Night"" is an immortal film classic because *everything* about this 1934 screwball comedy (about a beautiful heiress on the run, and the handsome reporter who follows her) works perfectly: the wonderful lead performances of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert (whose chemistry and comic sensibilitites are a joy to watch), great performances too from the whole supporting cast (no matter how small the roles), Frank Capra's very-assured direction, and Robert Riskin's hilarious, clever script. So many classic, crowd-pleasing moments throughout this film: the ""Walls Of Jericho"", the ""hitchhiking"" scene, the sing-along on the bus, Gable instructing Colbert on how to dunk a donut, Gable wading across the water with Colbert on his back (then spanking her!), the scene in the hay, and so many more. And the fact that ""It Happened One Night"" was shot in just four weeks flat....that's quite an accomplishment. ""It Happened One Night"" proved to be a box-office smash, and it swept all the top Oscar categories in 1935, and deservedly so: Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay (a feat that would not be matched for 40 years until ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" came along in 1975). I had always wanted to buy ""It Happened One Night,"" but the film had never been at an affordable price for me before, not even when it was originally out on videocassette---it was usually $24.99 or higher. But now with this 2008 DVD re-release, ""It Happened One Night"" is finally available at a VERY affordable price---and I have finally bought it at last! Nice extras on the DVD too, including commentary and insights from Frank Capra Jr. But the bonus feature I appreciate the most is the 1939 *radio play* broadcast of ""It Happened One Night,"" in which Gable and Colbert happily returned to their roles of Peter and Ellie. Adapted for radio, certain modifications were made to the script, and the story was trimmed down to just under an hour, but it's still great fun, and it's wonderful to hear Gable & Colbert whooping it up as this classic comedy couple once more. Reportedly, Colbert, displeased with the original film script, wasn't happy with the film at the time that she made it, thinking that ""It Happened One Night"" was the worst film she had ever done, and would regularly complain on-set on a daily basis. It was only when the film was finally released, became adored by audiences all over, and they put that Best Actress Oscar in Colbert's hand, that she finally realised how wrong she had been. ""It Happened One Night"" is truly one of the great comedy classics of cinema history, a genuine crowd-pleaser that anyone can enjoy. EVERY home should have a copy of ""It Happened One Night,"" and now, with this new low-priced DVD, every home can. So buy it, and watch those Walls Of Jericho topple!",1229212800,,2968,4.833005893909626
3621634,5,B001GUYAZY,"""I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband."" -- Colbert

So many wonderful film classics over the decades have imitated this one that some of the bloom has worn off this groundbreaking Capra masterwork. It remains a wildly charming and entertaining film, however, and one of the best romantic comedies in the history of film. Robert Riskin's screenplay offers a blend of humor and romance buoyed by the performances of Clark Gable and the incomparable Claudette Colbert.

Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is a rich socialite who runs away from her father (Walter Connolly) when he tries to have her recent marriage to an unworthy suitor annulled. She hops onboard a bus to evade the press and detectives her father has hired and heads for her husband. She has no experience in the real world, however, and her ill conceived plan did not include Peter Warren (Clark Gable).

Gable's Warren has just been fired from a major paper and his brash ways set none too well with Ellie at first either. But once he figures out who she really is, he has her over a barrel, and uses his leverage to travel with her and get a story that will put him right back on top. What follows has become sort of a formula for films in this genre, but as with most things, the original holds the most charm.

As they pretend to be a married couple, nature begins to take its course. Gable is hilarious giving a play by play lecture on how he undresses, and another on how to dunk a donut. His one on hitching a ride backfires, however, when it's Colbert's shapely legs which stops traffic. The ongoing Walls of Jericho is justly famous but, for my money, the piggy-backer arguement that climaxes with Gable giving Colbert a spank as her carries her across the water is the best moment between them.

As they get closer to their destination, Ellie crosses the walls and confesses her love for Peter. Leaving her during the night to sell a story about taking her to an island and marrying her himself, she thinks he has abandoned her and likewise. A bill for 39.60 and a father who knows what's best for his daughter culminates in an audience pleasing ending.

Few films have been as influential as Frank Capra's It Happened One Night. This is a marvelous piece of celluloid whose luster has only changed from glossy to satin with the passage of time. Sony is putting out this newly remastered edition which has audio commentary, a featurette, and the trailer. The cover art looks the same but is in color this time, making an attractive display for film buffs.

I still have an analog TV and really saw nothing wrong with the previous editions of this wonderful classic, not being that picky, so will leave this area to those more qualified in regards to the technical aspects. A must see film for anyone who loves the movies.",1228694400,,2836,4.615079365079365
3621635,5,B001GUYAZY,"What to say about a movie like this?  Claudette Colbert is adorable.  Clark Gable is at his alpha-male finest.  Frank Capra used his tried and true formula with humor to make one of the best romantic comedies of the 1930's.

A rebellious rich girl, Ellie Andrews (Colbert), runs away from her rich father because of his opposition to her marriage to King Westley, not a monarch but an upper class snob that her father loathes.  Who should she run into on a bus while fleeing than none other than a brash just-fired reporter named Peter Warne, played by Gable.  Let the war games begin as Colbert and Gable engage in the sophisticated and very funny running banter that makes the movie so appealing.

Her flight via the bus, and other forms of travel, is the vehicle for moving the couple and the plot along as their relationship develops.  He is using her for a story, ostensibly. She is using him as her protector, ostensibly.  What follows are a number of classic comic scenes which, of course, ineluctably lead to true love.

Colbert's successful skirt-lifting hitchhike has become the stuff of Hollywood legend, shown repeatedly for every conceivable purpose.  What is usually missing from that clip is the whole hilarious build up, brilliantly done by Gable as he demonstrates the tried and true ways of thumbing a ride. He does a wonderful job of setting his large male thumb, and ego, up for the big take-down that Colbert's lovely leg produces.

The blanket scenes in various cabins as they make their way across country together were considered extremely risqu in their day. The request for the toy horn is a fittingly excellent double entendre for the dnouement. After all adversities that King Westley and her father pose are overcome by true love the newly-eloped Warnes fittingly turn off the lights in  their honeymoon cabin, blow their ""Jericho"" toy horn, and let the blanket, and the curtain, fall.

This is a Frank Capra movie so you can expect the assumptions of privileged wealth (Colbert) to be challenged and scorned by a defender of the little guy like reporter Gable.  He refers to Colbert as ""brat"" in both angry and affectionate ways depending upon the situation.  Capra was nothing if not a true-believer in the American ideal that riches didn't make you better than the less-fortunate person seated next to you, in life or on a bus.

The movie contains scenes of harmony in the shared hard times of the Great Depression, like everyone singing together on the bus, Gable's aid to a poor boy, and his ""you're as good as me"" wave to hobos riding on a train. They are the predictable types of scenes which a viewer can find in every Capra movie; corny but no less heartwarming.  This is the stuff of good film-making. Throughout his career Capra truly evinced an idealism in his movies that is hard to picture in our time. It is amazing that he was able to preserve that idealism right through to his last movie in 1961, fittingly titled ""A Pocketful of Miracles.""",1226188800,,2987,4.7335907335907335
3621636,4,B001GUYAZY,"It is a very rare thing when a light-hearted comedy, something that is quintessentially the stuff of a `good movie,' breaches into that territory where the term `good film' can also be applied, but Frank Capra's 1934 film It Happened One Night may be an exception. Today, most people know Capra solely for his rediscovered classic It's A Wonderful Life, made a dozen years later, but this film was his first stab at what most critics would label greatness. This is all the more interesting because the 1930s, with their still newly developed sound technology, were still a transition period, of sorts, with the over the top hammy expressionistic acting of the silent films still dominating more than the more subtle naturalism of later film eras.
  As a comedy, this is all the more striking, since there was not the manifest symbolism of some of the great silent film comedians, nor was there the social satire of the 1960s madcap comedies, nor those of Woody Allen's intellectualized Golden Era. Yet, Capra's film, aside from its fame as having lifted Columbia Pictures from the bottom of the film studio heap, and being the first film to win the Big Five Oscars in a single year- Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Lead Actor, and Best Lead Actress, is credited with being the first `screwball comedy,' a subgenre of the romantic comedy, that flourished during the Great Depression and World War Two years. The films that this film kicked off all were romantic comedies, but the main focus of the films was on the frustrations the protagonists went through before inevitably ending up together in the end, rather than the stuff of pulp novels. Another aspect of this film, which makes it relevant today, is the brisk pace at which it was filmed, acted, and even edited. It is not as noticeable today, in Hollywood's caffeinated era, but compare it to any of a few dozen other films from that era and the difference is startling.... there are a few cringe-inducing moments when the era is shown at its worst- with a portrayal of a Stepin Fetchit like black railroad character, but that's a minor cavil in an otherwise great comedy, and possibly great film. After all, greatness includes- it does not preclude, humanity, and Capra was as infected by the worst of his times as anyone. But what makes a man great, especially an artist, is the degree to which those times claw at him, and the percentage of times a man of his time becomes a man for all times. The same is true for his art, and this artist and his film pass both of those bars. It Happened One Night is still as funny as it ever was, and the fact that you will get a bit more is the type of bonus feature DVDs alone cannot provide.",1221177600,,2738,4.643298969072165

The plot is simplistic; no need to embellish a theme repeated hundreds of times. But, just imagine even one short sex scene in a 2008 remake completely ruining the movie. No, the chemistry between the budding lovers is just fine, thank you; even an idiot can tell where this duet is heading. One story, perhaps apochryphal, has Colbert showing up late for the Oscar ceremony, leaving a cabbie waiting outside the theater, running down the aisle, accepting the award , and running back outside jumping into the cab. As Gable had  said in the movie: ""All you dames are so darned dizzy"".",1202169600,,1157,4.616504854368932
3621645,5,B001GUYAZY,One of three GREAT movies to sweep all 5 major Academy Awards.  Just watched the movie again recently with the kids.  Pure classic entertainment for the whole family.,1194134400,,166,4.892857142857143
3621646,2,B001GUYAZY,"Content-wise, this is a good movie except that when you consider that this was up against ""The Thin Man"" in the same categories save Best Actress, I find it hard to believe that this movie is the better screwball romance of the two.  Firstly, the jokes are more frequent and are less dated sounding and I found myself laughing at them although I was born more than 3 decades later and overall ""The Thin Man"" moves along at a good pace making it for me the true Best Picture of 1934.  Woody Van Dyke was also the better director although I can see how the screenplay award could go down to the wire.

As the second best movie of 1934, this movie has a few good things going for it although to call it the best ever screwball romantic comedy would be ridiculous as there are many better ones such as ""My Girl Friday"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"" just to name a couple let alone ""The Thin Man"", as it does have a pretty good screenplay and both Gable and Claudette have a good on-screen chemistry.  I thought the film dragged on a little though and was not as smooth flowing as say ""The Thin Man"" and the ""logic"" of going on foot instead of continuing on the bus and in not telling Ellie why he had to go and get gas in the middle of the night escapes me but what made this film great is the great acting of both Gable and Claudette who both deserved their Oscars although I can see why Bette Davis would feel aggrieved after her great performance in ""Of Human Bondage"".

The problem with this DVD though is the very poor sound and visual quality of the transfer when compared with ""The Thin Man"".  Perhaps the original masters were better preserved for the latter film but the difference in quality is night and day if you can get a copy of the DVDs to compare them you'll see what I mean.  A little known fact about this movie though is that the scene on the cover is what inspired the creation of Bugs Bunny as creator Chuck Jones stated that he saw Gable as a ""big rabbit"" and if you watch early Bugs Bunny cartoons, you'll see more than a slight resemblance to Peter Warne as portrayed in the movie.

To conclude, good movie but poor DVD transfer and certainly NOT the best picture of 1934.",1189468800,,2192,4.290556900726393

3621655,5,B001GUYAZY,"""It Happened One Night"" was the first film to win all 5 major Academy Awards in 1934 and holds a spot on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#35), yet remains unseen by many. You hardly hear it mentioned as being a great movie by film critics. For a movie I had little faith in when I began watching it, I realized that this is a film that deserves being in the top 100 and is a film that is really hard not to enjoy. The movie stars Claudette Colbert as Ellie Andrews, a spoiled young woman, who has married a playboy, that is being kept ""hostage"" on her father's boat until he can arrange to have their marriage annulled. In response to this, she jumps off the boat and swims to shore to get on a bus and head to New York. Then there's Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who has just been fired from his job as a newspaperman but sees his chance to get his job back by getting a story on Ellie. After all, she's a hot item with the press. Her father has sent private detectives looking for her and she frequently makes front-page news. It's easy to travel with her, she has little money, and needs Peter's help. The only problem is, they can't stand each other. The movie is predictable, they (and this isn't a spoiler) fall in love of course, and it's a story that has been copied thousands of times. You can see hints of this film in movies like ""Overboard"" or even older movies like ""The African Queen."" Despite being 73 years old, this movie has not lost its charm or wit. It actually is a pretty funny movie. It's directed by Frank Capra, one of the most acclaimed director's of all time, and I like this film better than his ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" which places higher on A.F.I.'S Top 100. Gable and Colbert have great screen chemistry and look like they enjoyed making the film together (although movie lore says Colbert hated every second of it). The movie's ending is perfect (if you've been paying attention to the film) and is the only ending I can imagine that would've worked for it. In today's romantic comedies, the main characters finally fall for each other and have sex. Nothing really that new. Here, it's just a very funny moment. As for the DVD quality; Picture, sound, and subtitles are all perfect. Even if you're not sure you'll enjoy this movie (like I was), you should check it out. You won't be wasting your time.

3621659,4,B001GUYAZY,"Even though it gets lumped in with the other screwball classics of the period, Frank Capra's seminal 1934 comedy seems to have more in mind in studying Depression-era values at the same time it follows the antics of incognito runaway heiress Ellie Andrews and ambitious reporter Peter Warne, who smells a good story in her escape. Written by Robert Riskin, the plot begins with Ellie trapped aboard her wealthy father's yacht in South Florida. With the idea of meeting up with her errant fianc, King Westley, in New York, she makes a run for it by taking a bus where she meets Peter. Unlike other comedies of this ilk (e.g., ""Roman Holiday""), the two lead characters know each other's identity early on, and the rest of the story is about how they forego their prejudices about each other and fall in love.

The early awareness of the characters signals the greater context of the story, which resides in a country awash in economic desperation, whether it's shown through Ellie's aversion to eating raw carrots or at an auto-camp where dozens queue up to take a morning shower. In fact, the class distinction between the pampered Ellie and the world-wise Peter is what makes up most of the laughs, for instance, the memorable hitchhiking and doughnut-dunking lessons and of course, the legendary ""Walls of Jericho"" scene. Considering how the two stars were forced to make the film, both show themselves in top form. As Peter, Clark Gable shows the lighter side of his macho-driven image without upending it, while Claudette Colbert brings her particularly effervescent style to Ellie.

An unforced sexiness permeates the scenes between Gable and Colbert which makes some of the more preposterous story turns more bearable, starting with why Ellie's marital predicament is front-page news. Walter Connolly is in his standard blowhard mode as Ellie's demanding father. A few scenes go on a bit long in typical Capra-corn fashion like the bus sing-along of ""The Daring Young Man in His Flying Trapeze"". However, it's still very worthwhile to see. Kudos to Joseph Walker's luminescent cinematography, especially during the moonlit haystack scene, and to costume designer Robert Kalloch for Ellie's knockout diaphanous wedding gown in the finale. Westley's wedding arrival by ""auto-gyro"", a hybrid between a helicopter and a glider, must have been quite a sight in 1934. The 1999 DVD has no extras.",1162166400,,2394,5.058227848101266

3621668,5,B001GUYAZY,"Consider this, ""It Happened One Night"" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant.

The main reason ""It Happened One Night"" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: ""That French broad likes money"" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.

The film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father's private detectives she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.

While the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: ""Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It's also clever, funny and a bit risqu (for 1934)"" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.

After the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.

3621670,5,B001GUYAZY,"Frank Capra made so many immortal and Oscar-winning screen classics in the 1930s-and classics that really hold up well today even as they speak to Depression America's unemployed working class-that is it hard to select only one for you to watch on home video.  As good a place to start as any is the incomparable screwball romantic comedy, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934, Columbia).  For starters, it swept the Academy Awards in 1934-Picture, Capra as Director, Clark Gable as Actor, Claudette Colbert as Actress, and Robert Riskin for Screenplay.

Colbert plays spoiled and independent heiress Ellie Andrews.  The film opens with her fleeing incognito from a detestable pre-arranged wedding by her father (Walter Connolly).  She hops a night bus from Miami to New York.  At the same time, Gable's Peter Warne is an unemployed and wise-cracking newspaper reporter.  He gets on the same bus, then conveniently wants exclusive rights to her story when he learns who she is.  As in all great 1930's screwball romantic comedies, the dialogue is fast paced and the two leads will fall in love.  But what will father say when Ellie eventually tells him that it is Peter she loves and not her drippy fiance King Westley?  What will King say to no marriage to him?

It seems that no one wanted to do IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, which was originally called NIGHT BUS after the magazine story it is based on.  Capra made the movie because Columbia studio boss Harry Cohn ordered him to; Capra hated the script.  Gable was on punishment loan-out from MGM, and Colbert was on punishment loan-out from Paramount.  Columbia at that time was contemptuously called ""Poverty Row.""  Yet, despite all of the hatred-or maybe because of it-a masterpiece of a screwball comedy was created in only a few shooting weeks.  I have heard that halfway through filming, Gable and Colbert were having a great time, and Capra thought maybe the script wasn't half bad.  Imagine the 1934 Academy Awards when EVERYONE won an Oscar!

There are so many great scenes here-Peter undressing in a tourist cabin and revealing no undershirt, after he has cut the room in half with a rope and a blanket.  ""Perhaps you'd like to see how a man undresses.  You know, no two men do it alike.""  She runs to her side of the room, and he laughs good-naturedly.  Then he gives her a dunking donuts lesson in the morning.

After Peter realizes who he ""slept"" with via a newspaper story, he gets his job back and wants an exclusive on the story; the boss says yes, if he is on the level.  A bus accident forces Peter and Ellie to hike through a gorgeously photographed B&W moonlit forest and stream.  On a day road, we have the famous carrot eating and hitchhiking scene.  It remains funny and memorable after seventy years, as does the whole film.

We are into the homestretch-the hitchhiking scene takes place about an hour into a 105 minute film.  Peter, who first viewed Ellie as just a story, has grown very fond of her romantically.  Both characters are defiantly independent, so IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT really seems fresh and alive as its principal duo fall in love.  But, again, what will dad Connelly and fiance King Westley say when Ellie returns with the news that she wants to marry a working class reporter and not an upper class snob?

You know this has a happy ending.  Films of this type always did, which is why they are still so much fun.  How it happens here will remain a secret by me, except to say that director Capra and writer Riskin make some profound-and still timely--statements about the hardworking common man and the superficial upper class.

In the end, after a major misunderstanding, Colbert decides not to go through with the marriage, and, to her father's delight, runs off with Gable.

It's also one of the few films I've ever seen that is literally without a single dull moment in it --surely a rarity, even in the most expensive films (and this one cost all of $375,000 to make in 1934).

The spoiled runaway heiress who finds true love with the down-to-earth newspaper reporter isn't the most original idea in movies -- but what Capra, Riskin (the writer), Gable & Colbert do with it is beyond priceless. Among other highlights in this thoroughly delightful film are the scene where Gable singlehandedly destroyed the men's undershirt industry by revealing a bare chest while undressing; Gable's argument with a bus driver; the scene already mentioned by other reviewers of Colbert's unique method of stopping a car after Gable, who claims to be a hitchhiking expert, has failed miserably; the breakfast scene in which Gable teaches Colbert how to dunk a doughnut properly; the falling-over funny scene of Gable & Colbert impersonating a brawling married couple to outwit her father's detectives; and the scene where he lectures her about piggyback riding and the virtues of the common man while carrying her across a stream. (But I must confess my favorite scene is probably Gable's argument with Colbert's father at the end of the film. When her father finally nails him down and says, ""Do you love her?"", Gable, after evading the question, finally answers, ""Yes! But don't hold that against me, I'm a little screwy myself!"")

Gable's performance here is simply his very best after GONE WITH THE WIND. There couldn't have been any close contenders for the Best-Actor Oscar that year; Gable simply walks off with the movie, in rollicking fashion, and it is abundantly clear while watching him exactly why women found him the Sexiest Man Alive (at that time, and for many years afterward). Even seventy years later, and more than 40 years after his death, he's still a heartbreaker here. He's funny and playful and tender and strong ... whew! It's a tragedy that current generations know so little about him and his remarkable career -- but they will get more than their fill of his very potent charm in this picture.

Colbert plays a fairly thankless part with great elegance and sophistication. While acting spoiled and bored and rebellious, she's also charming, funny and perfectly unimpressed with Gable's antics -- right up to the moment when she realizes she's in love with him.

All the supporting players (all studio actors) are wonderful, too, even in this essentially two-person movie. The guy playing Oscar Shapeley, the conceited suburban bore, was a Best Supporting Actor shoo-in -- wonder why HE didn't win that year, too? And the roles of Colbert's father and Gable's editor were beautifully filled. No one phoned in their work on this movie; every performance and nuance is a gem.

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, after seventy years, is as fresh and funny as though it were made yesterday -- my nine-year-old and six-year-old sons both adore it, too.

Classic doesn't always mean boring. Sometimes -- as in this case -- classic means timeless. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT will be funny in this century and the next century and every century where men and women meet and fall in love.",1094860800,,3422,4.871134020618556
3621680,5,B001GUYAZY,"70 years later, this movie still holds up beautifully.  It's funny, smart, and, man! those sexy, charming leads!  I'd ride a bus with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert anywhere ...
This ones recommended for everyone -- old people, young people ...  It hasn't aged, and it'll always be a good time.",1089158400,,297,4.784313725490196
3621681,5,B001GUYAZY,"A spoiled socialite (Claudette Colbert) flees her wealthy father (Walter Connolly) and heads for New York to marry a rich playboy (Jameson Thomas) against her father's will.  The whereabouts of Ellie Andrews and the reward for her return become the stuff of national headlines, so when recently fired reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) recognizes her, he decides to stick close so he can write the story.  Naturally, romance follows, but it's a bumpy and hugely entertaining road to get there.
This is an absolutely wonderful film.  It's such a shame that so many people are not interested in watching an old black-and-white movie.  Good work is timeless.  Gable and Colbert have wonderful chemistry and are both hilarious and touching.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  Even though the story is set during the Great Depression, it doesn't seem dated at all.  The wisecracking between characters is sharp and well-written (by screenwriter Robert Riskin); there are lots of laugh-out-loud moments during this film.  It's also pretty racy and suggestive for its time, with a genuinely affecting climax.  Another level of interest is added by the careful attention that director Frank Capra pays to the depression-era milieu; Colbert's character really doesn't understand the plight of the common man, but Gable's hard-bitten reporter is all too aware of the hard times that people are going through.  This adds a fascinating sociological dimension.",1087084800,,1457,5.237068965517241
3621682,5,B001GUYAZY,"When IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT was released in 1934, the movie was not a hit either with the fans or the critics.  The producers were ready to relegate director Frank Capra's film to the dustbins of the filmshelf.  But then a strange thing happened.  Word of mouth spread the news that this was a film of import and fun.  In just a few short months, the lines around the few theaters that were still showing it were long enough to convince the producers that they should redistribute it, and so they did. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has been in more or less continuous showing since then. It garnered a slew of Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor for Clark Gable and Best Actress for Claudette Colbert.
Critics of IHON justly call it a magnificent early example of a screwball comedy, and it is surely that, but repeated viewings imbue it with a series of social and economic subtexts that the contemporary audience could relate to.  Clark Gable is Peter Warne, a huckstering newpaperman who has the great bad fortune to hook up with Ellen Andrews (Colbert), a spoiled socialite who is running away from her overbearing magnate father who wants to annul her marriage to a foppish goldhunter King Westlake.  The majority of the film is an early version of a comedic but stark version of Kerouac's ON THE ROAD, with Gable and Colbert trying to travel from Florida to New York, all the while pursued by detectives hired by her father to catch them.  When fans think of reasons why they love IHON, they usually point to the famous hitchhiking scene where Colbert's raised skirt gets a ride when Gable's thumb proves inadequate.  Then, these fans mention the blanket between the lovers scene in which the symbolic Walls of Jericho slowly come tumbling down as each reaches out to the other to reveal their growing attraction.  The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is so strong that one wonders why they never paired up again.  Yet,IHON is more than a screwball comedy that permits the lovers to dash in and out of improbable situations.  As they travel the dusty roads of backwoods America, a depression oriented America that was all too well versed in such meanderings could travel right along with them.  The communal singing on the bus scene is not simply a musical interlude between scenes; it temporarily places Gable and Colbert into the background and propels the image of lonely travelers on the road reaching out to one another in a fashion that must have resonated with many viewers.  From bus to hitchhiking to tramping dusty roads, Gable and Colbert proved yet again that the magic of chemistry when allied with the right social subtext could produce a film that even today can place the video audience right there in the same creaky car driven by that suitcase thief.  If director Capra proves anything it is that true magic does not vary to fit changing economic or social climates. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is truly one of the all time great moments in film history.",1077926400,,2972,4.723404255319149
3621683,5,B001GUYAZY,"I orginially watched this film when I was 15-years-old. At the time I didn't like black-and-white films. I thought they were boring and slow; had no action and no entertainment value. Boy was I wrong! My views and appreciation of Golden Age films, (espeically black-and-white), changed forever after watching this classic romantic comedy.

""IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT"", originally titled ""NIGHT BUS"", was a low budget movie panned early on by film critics, but embraced by moviegoers all over America. The critics (who had snubbed the film at first) were undoubtedly curious about its fast-growing popularity. They reviewed it again, but under closer inspection. During the following year (in 1935), the film was nominated and had swept the top five major Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay.

The movie is a true classic, endeared by generations of filmgoers and influencing much of what we see in today's romantic comedies. It's responsible for a specific formula: The common scenario being boy meets girl, boy and girl despise each other, boy and girl fall in love with each other, boy loses girl, boy eventually wins girl back. You've seen it. So many times in fact that the stories and characters generally seem jaded and contrived. Many of these films fail to duplicate the magic of this 1934 classic. The acting, too, usually isn't up to par to a Gable or Colbert--both of whom deliver stellar performances in this film. The sparring between these two legendary actors is priceless!

Overall, it's a highly recommended film. Frank Capra's directing is superb, the cast is terrific, and the crisp, witty dialogue certainly makes this one of the best films ever! Watch it and enjoy. 5 stars!!!

**Note: Gable and Colbert collaborated again in a film called ""BOOM TOWN"", which was released in 1940. The movie was a huge disappointment, however. Pretty dismal and lacked the same fine quality and spark that was so evident in ""IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT"".**",1076803200,,2005,5.066666666666666
3621684,5,B001GUYAZY,"""It Happened One Night"" is an excellent comedy released in 1934.  It garnered five Oscars, including Best Picture.  Its unique laughter attracting style remains entertaining, regardless how many viewings.  Its love story theme remains funny and serious in the perfect scenes.  Its many twists and turns keeps audiences interested in what will happen next, from Ellie's escape from her father and fiance to Ellie meeting Peter to the two slowly falling in love.  There is no dull moment.  Such writing quality is only one movie detail that makes it classic-worthy.  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert earned an Oscar for their lead roles.  Both brilliant actors offer their own comedy and serious theme, which adds more flavor.  Regardless if they express greed, love, rejection, happiness, or anger, their every moment is flawless.  ""It Happened One Night"" is a great classic film for those looking for unique humor.  This will surely continue pleasing audiences for many more years.",1075766400,,982,5.230769230769231
3621685,5,B001GUYAZY,"I have loved this movie forever.  It is the simple story of a poor little rich girl (Colbert)who runs away from her tycoon father in hopes of making it to New York to wed her playboy fiance.  A newspaper reporter (Gable) is on her trail and hopes to get the scoop of the season by cozying up to her and getting the inside story of her surprise wedding. When their night bus breaks down, the bickering couple hitchike to New York.  Of course, sparks fly between the two of them as they fall in love.
This is a terrifically funny movie that tells a great story.  Along the way, the movie offers up a snapshot of 1934 American life that is true and vanished.
Everyone loves this movie.  People who hate black and white movies love this movie.  Even cool 19 year old boys who only relate to the Sopranos love this movie. I have never known anyone who watched this movie who didn't also love it.",1065830400,,890,4.299401197604791

You've probably read the story from other reviewers, so I won't remind you, but I just thought the plot was very clever and the humor just has to make you laugh.  I really didn't like Clark Gable before I saw this movie, but my opinion of him improved after seeing this movie.  I even got my mom to see this and she loved it as well!  The DVD is great and the VHS is great.  either way, you can't lose!:)",1062806400,,463,4.043956043956044
3621687,5,B001GUYAZY,"I feel like a kid in the candy store. Having finally purchased the DVD of this wonderful film there's a sense that I did something right. This film has no heavy moral ambiguity but it still has a wonderful portrayal of the human condition in America. Clark Gable as Peter Warne is a lovable cad of a newsman. He's not terrible but he is manipulative. He's also sincere. I never know just when he actually falls in love with the swanky material girl, Ellen Andrews, played by the spunky Claudette Colbert, but you know it's happening along every step of their reluctant road trip. Her change of heart is forced upon her when the reality of how she will miss Peter when the trip is over. She learns a little humility and he learns that even the rich and spoiled can be sincere as well as fall in love with a regular Joe. This is such a delightful pairing that it's amazing that I've never seen them paired again in other movies. Marvelous chemestry exists between them and they are the perfect foil for each other's hard-headed assuptions about the other. This movie is also a wonderful slice of director Frank Capra's gift for revealing genuine scenes of Americans and Americana. Our strengths and our faults ride side by side throughout the odyssey from Miami to New York. The strengths win out with a few personal compromises leading to revelations along the way. I caught myself smiling by the movie's end. No surprise there. The picture on this DVD is full screen and not widescreen. Having never seen the film is a theater I have no idea if any cropping occurred. However, the picture is surprisingly clean and clear. All around, this is some of the best money I've spent on a DVD.",1059436800,,1685,4.564356435643564

The two stars are great in their Oscar-winning performances. I just can't get enough of either of them! The only complaint I have is when Gable goes off in search of food w/out telling Colbert, and she COMPLETELY freaks out. Not funny. Annoying.
I'm too lazy to look up the names of the dudes who played Colbert's father and fiance, King Westley. Let's just say this, though: the dad is really funny and entertaining!!! Westley is, to put it politely, a major FREAK OF NATURE!!!
I totally recommend this movie to anyone!!!",1057622400,,742,4.8046875
3621689,2,B001GUYAZY,"""It Happened One Night"" is the story of Peter Warren (Clark Gable), the happy go lucky newspaper hound who discovers that missing heiress, Ellie McPherson (Claudette Colbert) is actually traveling with him on the cross country night bus. Determined to expose Ellie, Peter finds himself falling for her instead. Director Frank Capra's original road trip movie gives us some real gems, not the least of which is watching Ellie hoist her skirt up to passer-bys on the open road in order to secure suitable transportation.
Colbert, not always the most congenial of stars, absolutely refused to make this picture and had to be strong armed by Columbia chief, Harry Cohn. While working, Colbert reportedly didn?t try very hard at playing her part, was constantly in conflict with Capra and, after principle photography was completed, stormed off the set declaring that this was the worst picture she had ever made. Small irony that the role Colbert liked the least is the one which garnered her only Best Actress Oscar. Gable, who had been loaned out by MGM as punishment for refusing to do a part in one of their pictures, took home the Best Actor statuette. So much for punishing ?the king?!
Unfortunately, Columbia Home Video's presentation of this Academy Award winning masterwork is punishment enough. While the film has had extensive restoration, thanks to the Library of Congress, the DVD exhibits a generally soft picture with slightly out of focus images. Some scenes are so blurry that they suggest a dupe negative was cut into the first generation camera negative. There is some aliasing and shimmering, as well as an almost total loss of fine details during many of the scenes taking place at night.. The soundtrack has been restored as well but continues to exhibit a scratchy background hiss and distracting pops with varying degrees of audibility. The one extra worth mentioning is ""Frank Capra Jr. Remembers..."" a snippet in which the son of the director talks about his father and the movie. It's too short but interesting nevertheless.",1050624000,,2047,5.023529411764706
3621690,5,B001GUYAZY,"Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is a hilarious battle of the sexes that has lost little of its charm, despite the passage of almost seventy years. Clark Gable is at his best, and funniest, as the wise-talking, street-smart New York journalist who stumbles upon the spoiled and precocious Claudette Colbert, a rich kid on the run from her millionnaire father and an unwanted bridegroom. Together, Gable and Colbert have the chemistry to make this witty comedy triumph.
Sexuality is dealt with humorously, though never in a contrived or censorious manner. On the contrary, every moment breathes raw sexuality, and eyebrows will be raised more than once, despite the lack of explicit sexual content. In an age of cinema when sexual humour is often nothing more than sheer crudity, It Happened One Night is an inspiredly hilarious, masterfully executed and supremely adult sex comedy that knows the difference between humour and vulgarity.",1048636800,,939,5.184210526315789
3621691,5,B001GUYAZY,"Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable make a wonderfully romantic couple.  They are sweet one moment and fightin gin the next.  It has comedy, drama, romance, and a good storyline.  Claudette's father kidnaps her on his boat to stop her from going back to a husband that he forbad her to nmarry and Clark ends up helping her find her way back to him.  Really good, classic, and funny.",1045526400,,380,4.544117647058823
3621692,5,B001GUYAZY,"From the time the subtly sexy Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) falls into the witty Peter Warne's (Clark Gable) lap on the bus you know this is going to be just an adorable romantic classic. Especially when Clark Gable says: ""Next time you drop in, bring your folks.""

A reporter needs a story and an heiress is running away from her controlling father. She is not even used to being alone in the same room with a man, let alone sleeping in his pajamas. (so cute)

If you can make it through the ""flying trapeze"" song you will be well rewarded. The singing in this movie probably seems a bit cheesy even to those of us who are not jaded and love old movies. There are many laugh-out-loud moments that catch you completely unawares. Like the time Peter gives Ellie a good smack. Don't know why, but it is quite funny.

I mean, he is carrying her across a river in a precarious position, hands her the suitcase, then gives her a smack on the butt and then continues on as if nothing happened. Another reviewer made this sound like abuse, but it really is just funny. These days the woman would hit back as in ""Buffy"" or be offended in some way.

It is difficult not to watch the entire movie with a silly grin on your face because the characters are just so endearing. You have to love how Colbert stops a car and how Peter protects her from his prying eyes by putting up a blanket between them in the hotel room. Where else was she going to sleep? She was broke and hiding out from her millionaire father (Walter Connolly).

I love the scene where she tells Peter he can leave if he wants and then is terrified when she finds him gone. Fortunately, he just went to look for carrots because she was hungry.

A movie I could watch over and over again, but would forward through the singing!

Cute sassy innocence with an undercurrent of desire.

If you doubt that this movie is better than most modern romantic comedies, be ready for a real surprise. It will really capture your attention.

I liked the way he portrays a drunkin' news reporter, yelling at his boss over the telephone while his drunkin friends cheered him on. I also liked what he said when claudette colbert was standing up over him on the bus as it started to leave the station. The bus moved and jerked her back; down on his lap. He told her, ""Next time you drop in bring your folks."" That was pretty funny. It's a comedy, and a romance that everyone in the family could enjoy. I recommend it.",1032048000,,523,4.24
3621698,5,B001GUYAZY,"Made in 1934 by Frank Capra, It Happened One Night was the first romantic comedy that would later be put into the genre of ""screwball comedy."" It is also one of the best screwball comedies ever made (actually, I think it is one of the best comedies ever made, in general)!
Anyhow, It Happened One Night is basically the story of a willfull heiress named Ellie Andrews, played by Claudette Colbert, who escapes her father's protection to find and marry the man she loves. Along the way, however, she meets a reporter named Peter, played by Clark Gable, who sticks with her in order to eventually write a story on her adventures. Both Colbert and Gable give excellent performances, and the dialogue between the two characters is really sweet and funny.
So, if you haven't seen this - what are you waiting for? It Happened One Night is a perfect example of the kind of movies that have pretty much disappeared today: movies with captivating and original plots, good dialogue, and great acting - and without obscene language or inappropriate scenes.

3621700,5,B001GUYAZY,"Without any question, this is one of the classic comedies of film history. It signaled the beginning of Frank Capra's career as a marquee director. Although he had made a bevy of films before this one, from IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT on, Capra was a directing star. Unlike most of his later films, this film does not have the social or political overtones of many of those films. The performances in this film are among the finest comic roles in the history of film. Most of Clark Gable's fame rests on his many hard hitting dramas and action films, but he was amazingly as effective here in a pure comedy as in any of his other films. Cladette Colbert specialized in comedy (though she also managed some top flight dramatic roles), and managed several star turns as excellent as she was here (THE PALM BEACH STORY and MIDNIGHT), but even if she had not made the other films, we would remember her today because of this film. The film is graced with several superb turns by character actors like Roscoe Kerns (as the oily and opportunistic Oscar Shapeley), Walter Connolly, and Alan Hale.
There are as many classic scenes in this film as any you can think of. Bugs Bunny's carrot chewing habit was supposedly borrowed by his creators from Clark Gable in the famous hitchhiking scene. The Walls of Jericho scene has been mimicked in several other films. We remember these scenes because they are funny, well-written, and superbly acted. Without any question, one of the great films. The fact that the movie won the four most important Oscars--Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director--merely confirms what any viewer can see for themselves.
Nonetheless, there are somethings that I find disturbing in the film. Part of the reason is the fact that the movie embodies some very disturbing attitudes towards women. These attitudes don't have to be teased out or discovered by a microscopic examination of key scenes. The attitudes are blatant and in-your-face. If anyone doubts me, just watch the movie again with an eye for how Claudette Colbert is treated, and imagine oneself in that position. For instance, at once point Peter Warren (Gable) tells the father of Ellie Andrews (Colbert) that what she needs is a husband who will belt her everyday, whether she deserves it or not (her father seems to agree with him). Today, the notion of any man ""belting"" his wife under any conditions is offensive. Throughout the movie, Cable pushes, shoves, picks up, and bosses Colbert around. He pretty much treats her as if she were a doll. By today's standards, he frequently invades her personal space. He tells her to shut up, and she shuts up. In one scene, Gable is carrying Colbert on his shoulder across a creek (itself a fairly demeaning position), when he smacks her on the butt for arguing with him. It is impossible to imagine any of Barbara Stanwyck's characters putting up this kind of treatment. Quite apart from all this, Cable's machismo is really, really hard to take in the early part of the 21st century. Unfortunately, this is a feature of most of his characters, and is, I believe, one of the reasons that his popularity has fared so badly in comparison with so many of his more important contemporaries like Bogart, Jimmy Stewart, or Cary Grant. There are just too many scenes in this film that you have to watch with blinders on. In other words, the films reflects social ideas that are part of a world that no longer exists.
The film feels dated in other ways as well. Technologically, the sound is not quite as good as we would find in films only a year or two later, often sounding boxy. Like in many of Capra's films, many of the characters, especially characters who make only brief appearances, seem cardboardish, unbelievable, and simplistic. They reflect ways of speaking and attitudes that many viewers will find difficult to understand. These characters just strike us as wrong and unconvincing, and for that reason, remote. This is not true of many other films of the thirties and forties, though it is frequently true of the films of Capra. Compare Ward Bond's bus driver with nearly any minor character in THE AWFUL TRUTH or BRINGING UP BABY or THE LADY EVE or TO BE OR NOT TO BE or THE PALM BEACH STORY, and my point is understood. I don't know if the fault is Capra (which I suspect, since he had a number of simplistic and naively optimistic characters in a number of his films--one of the factors figuring into what is known as Capra-corn) or the fact that the film is one of the older talking pictures that we actually still watch. It doesn't keep the film from being a classic of the first rank, but it does supply a disturbing undertone.",1010534400,,4680,4.701583434835566
3621701,5,B001GUYAZY,"This thourghly entertaining film set the vogue for the many screw-ball comedies of the thirties and forties. It was the first of it's kind and possibly the best. And much of it's success was due I think to the performance of Clark Gable, playing a alcoholic reporter with an eye for a good story. How I wish he had done more light-comedy instead of allowing himself to be steered into the tough, macho, Rhett Butler type roles.
This very enjoyable film gets off to a good start with it's opening scene in which we are shown Gable, as Peter Warne, standing in a phone-booth, drunk, arguing with his belligerent editor who has just sacked him, while outside wait a gang of his admiring cronies. When the exasperated editor rings off, Gable unwilling to admit defeat, continues an imaginary conversation which he brings to an apparently triumphant conclusion. This so delights his cronies that they carry him away shoulder-high chanting, ""Make way for the king."" thus, presumably, originating his tag as ""The King of Hollywood.""
This too must have been the first ""Road"" film. He meets on a crowded bus,
Ellie Andrews, beautifully played by Claudet Colbert, a recalcitrant, snobbish and spoilt wealthy heiress who is on the run from her domineering father who has sent two detectives in pursuit and put out a reward for her ""recapture"". She is suspicious of everyone and initially treats Peter Warne with disdain. But through a whole series of misadventures during which he consistently demonstrates he is on her side, he eventually wins her over and she agrees to give him the story he needs. But will she give him anything more? To find out we are kept in suspense until the very last minute.
There are many memorable scenes in this film and here are a few of my favourites: his sublimely ridiculous altercation with a monosyllabic bus-driver, played by Ward Bond, who's repartee seems limited to two words, ""Oh yeah?"": the entertaining rendition by all the bus passengers of ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze."" with individuals poping up to do their own thing: the ride they hitch from a boisterous and deceptively friendly car-driver, played by Alan Hale: and the scene in which when two of her dad's detectives knock on the door of their chalet in an ""Auto-Park"" they instantly transform themselves into a long-time married couple who are not getting on too well - she a cowed and miserable wife and he a loud-mouthed and bullying husband. Marvellous stuff.",1004572800,,2455,4.847619047619047
3621702,5,B001GUYAZY,"o.k. both, Casablanca and Gone with the Wind are great movies, but this one tops both as a classic, Frank Capra's first acknowledged masterpiece which won all of the important Academy Awards (5) for the first time. The acting and the scenario is so natural and believable, especially the relationship that develops between the characters played by Gable and Colbert. It's a pity these two great stars didn't act opposite each other in another comedy again (imagine them in a film by Preston Sturges or Mitchell Leisen! Gable would have been excellent in Don Ameche's role in Leisen's ""Midnight""). Sadly, the only other movie which starred both, was a so-so adenture-drama yarn called ""Boom Town"", at Metro. You must watch the crystal clear copy of the DVD version, it's a must for all of us who had to watch for years those bad copies they showed in TV.",999648000,,853,4.77027027027027
3621703,5,B001GUYAZY,"This is one of my favorite all time movies and to see it on DVD makes it much more special in the next viewing and another viewing later on with commentary from Frank Capra, Jr.
The movie deserves every Academy Award it has won and also to be recognized as one of the top 100 movies of all time by the American Film Institute.
The movie's video and audio has been digitally remastered and the special features was very nice to see.  Especially the ""Frank Capra Jr. Remembers"" segment, the trailers, vintage advertising and the original live radio broadcast is an even added bonus.  As well as the commentary by Frank Capra's son.
What I found quite interesting is to learn the behavior by our two main thespians behind-the-scenes especially with Claudette Colbert.
Otherwise it's a great movie classic that people should see!",994118400,,825,4.7622377622377625
3621704,5,B001GUYAZY,"What a great film ! The chemistry and dialogue that exists between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is amazingly BRILLIANT and FUNNY!  This is the type of black and white film that can be watched forever and ever and never seem ""dated"" and out of touch w/recent times: after all, its been almost 7O years since this movie was made and it still ranks up there w/ some of the best comedies of today!  I wasn't even born when the movie was made but I enjoyed it so much, I wanted to watch it again and again!  If that doesn't convince you, this video won 5 Oscars: Best Actor (GABLE), Best Actress (COLBERT), Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay!!
Here's a little summary for those who don't know what its about. Claudette Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, a rich, spoiled heiress running away from her family. During the trip, on a bus, she meets street-smart reporter Peter Warne, played by the handsome Clark Gable.  Ellie is definitely NOT street-smart, and she's having a few problems, so Peter agrees to help her out and travel w/ her in exchange for an exclusive story.  They go through many adventures together, despising each other along the way, until they find that they are reluctantly falling in love and afraid to admit it to each other...besides its a little bit more complicated since she's a married woman. AN EXCELLENT FILM, WITH A PERFECT ENDING-ONE OF GABLE'S BEST!! I GIVE IT A PERFECT 5 STARS!! AAA+++++",989366400,,1430,4.681274900398407
3621705,5,B001GUYAZY,"In ""It Happened One Night,"" Frank Capra invented the screen romantic comedy as we know it. Every boy-and-girl story from the mid-1930s on owes a debt to this graceful, witty, pleasing story of a runaway heiress and a wisecracking reporter who uncovers her secret. All of Capra's major themes are here--his celebration of spontaneity, charity and common friendliness; his depiction of how too much money can warp the human spirit--without the heavy-handedness or sentimentality that overwhelmed some of his later work. Clark Gable's blustery, smooth-talking masculinity and Claudette Colbert's sassy yet wistful delicacy are utterly perfect for this movie, and add immeasurably to its enchanting spell. This was the first movie to make a clean sweep of the Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress Oscars, and it was eminently deserving of that honor. Even today the movie seems modern and freshly minted, and it connects better with audiences than any other film of its era.",989280000,,975,5.296774193548387
3621706,4,B001GUYAZY,"To say that this light-hearted comedy doesn't ""age a bit"" is overstating the matter, but the overwhelming influence wrought by the success of the film makes it worth noting. Still, the age of the film is both part of its charm and part of its burden. The images of Depression-era travel and mores are fascinating, but I cringed at the multiple references to light violence as the cure to one character's spoiled nature. Also worth noting, though, is that none of this occurs on screen.
Clark Gable, sporting some sort of ""Snideley Whiplash"" moustache, puts in a very compelling performance as the rebellious reporter. Claudette Colbert hits several different notes, sometimes seemingly at random, as the spoiled banker's daughter who is trying to find a way to live with herself. She gets away with it because she manages to give full weight to the character. Both actors are fascinating to watch.
Everybody has their favorite scenes. For stark contrast, I like to think of the intensity which Gable and Colbert throw into their act when attempting to fool the detectives looking for them. Following that with the sweet gloating on Colbert's face after she's managed to hitch a ride for them.
I'm no fan of Capra, but he acquits himself okay here, staging some scenes rather cleverly, and, I think. It is a testament to his abilities that so many of the sketches placed throughout the movie have become ingrained in popular culture. In casting extras, every face is magnificent, every small role has the potential to leap out and be as startling as Smooth-Talkin' Shapeley, or the mad singing driver who picks up the hitchhikers.
Finally, the DVD transfer is pretty good, with sound better than you'll probably get anywhere else. The menu interface is very irritating if navigating by mouse on your computer.",987379200,,1808,4.9311475409836065
3621707,5,B001GUYAZY,"""It Happen One Night"" won the top 5 Oscars of 1934.  Best Picture, Best Director - Frank Capra, Best Actor - Clark Gable, Best Actress - Claudette Colbert & Screen Play.  This is one of the best ""screwball comedies"" ever.  (Screwball (Black) comedy was a type of comedy introduced during the Depression years (1930's) depicting strange scenarios, characters with twists and bazaar (screwball) plots).
In summary;  Rich, spoiled,runaway heiress Ellie (Colbert) & a newspaper reporter, Peter (Gable) have a chance meeting on a bus & end up together on a crazy romantic journey.  They are totally mismatched and in an adversarial relationship.  Their trek takes them through the Depression countryside of America where Ellie gets a strong dose of reality.  As events unfurl & situations occur they become involved & the rest is cinematic history.
This DVD is one of the best ever.  The picture & sound quality rival being at the original showing.  Probally because it is digitalized better!!!.  The extras, including a radio broadcast show with Gable and Colbert & one of the best movie commentaries by Frank Capra Jr. (Frank Sr's, son)are added treats to enjoy.  A great value DVD.
This is a great way to enjoy the Hollywood of the 30's and the stellar cast performing perfectly.",985910400,,1277,5.004739336492891
3621708,5,B001GUYAZY,"*It Happened One Night*  is the archetype of the romantic comedy form.  It's the story of a pretty heiress  (Claudette Colbert)  who runs away from her rather arranged wedding.  She's pursued by an unapologetically grouchy young newspaperman played marvelously by Clark Gable.  Really, what else can be said?  A masterpiece on every level, this old movie could teach its current imitators a thing or two about characterization, plot, real romance, and intelligent dialogue  (the script by Robert Riskin rises at times to near-Shakespearean comic levels).  It gets better:  director Frank Capra paints a broad canvas of American life in the Depression.  Location shots abound.  It's rare that an old studio picture like this, especially a romantic comedy, gets so much FRESH AIR.  The cinematography is matches the bold conception.  (Watch for the scene where Gable carries Colbert across the river at night.  Verrry nice.)
Colbert learns a lot about life during her exile with Gable, away from her castle in the air and on the road.  (Oh, it's also an archetypal ROAD movie, as well.)  Most importantly, she learns what it takes to be in Real Love, and finds, to her surprise and our delight, that she HAS what it takes.  Say much the same for the movie itself.  Add  *It Happened One Night*  to your collection.",984009600,,1312,4.953917050691245
3621709,5,B001GUYAZY,"When you hear the phrase uttered ""they don't make'em like they used to,"" films like It Happened One Night come immediately to mind.  This 1934 classic has it all:  great writing, direction, stars, character actors, cinematography, you name it.  If Clark Gable hadn't made Gone With The Wind five years later, this may have been the performance he'd be most remembered by.  As down-on-his-luck newspaperman Peter Warren, Gable is at his best.  As the spoiled, rich heiress Ellie Andrews, Claudette Colbert is his equal.  Her character is tough, yet vulnerable, spoiled, but lovable, sexy and innocent, and incredibly appealing.  Filled with classics scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny, this film is balanced by many poignant (Capraesque) scenes as well.  The dialogue, direction, and pacing are first-rate (there's never a dull moment), and the chemistry between the two leads is wonderful.  Both Gable and Colbert appear to be having the time of their lives.  The most famous scene is probably where Colbert stops a car with her beautiful legs when Gable's thumb doesn't get the job done, but there are many more to savor.  When Gable and Colbert pretend to be a feuding married couple, it's hard to keep a straight face and admire the ease at which they pull off this ruse.  Other memorable scenes include Alan Hale singing ""young people in love are very seldom hungry,"" Colbert's fiancee arriving at the wedding in the ""Autogyro,"" and Gable pretending to be a gangster to scare away an amorous traveling salesman (trying to snag Colbert).  And who can forget the Walls of Jericho?  But my favorite has to be the bus ride sing-a-long where everyone joins in to sing ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze""; it's an absolute gem.  There isn't enough to say about this wonderful picture.  After almost 70 years, It Happened One Night is as fresh as ever.  Of all the screwball comedies to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s, this one is in a league of its own.  And how many of today's movies have women's roles the equal of Colbert's?  She is more than set decoration; she's an essential part of the film.  Without her cool, sophisticated performance, Gable's everyman would seem less than it is.  A film that truly deserved every Academy Award it received, It Happened One Night is a movie that will live on forever.",976579200,,2311,4.844387755102041
3621710,5,B001GUYAZY,"It Happened One Night has aged very well, and it remains as funny and sexy as when it first premiered in 1934.  Claudette Colbert stars as an heiress  on the run, trying to get away from her controlling father who does not  approve of the man she has quickly married.  While on a bus to New York to  return to her new husband, she becomes entangled with news reporter Clark  Gable, a man who feels only contempt for her (at first), but who won't pass  up a good story.  Colbert and especially Gable are in top form, displaying  a terrific chemistry in Frank Capra's comedy.  The scenes I enjoyed are the  same as everyone else - the walls of Jericho and Colbert's method for  hitch-hiking.  But my favourite scene is in the cabin when they pretend to  be a bickering married couple to throw off investigators looking for her.  Their ""improv"" is hysterical.  I can't believe that after almost  seventy years, this film has not dated.  Give credit to Capra, writer  Robert Riskin, and of course, the star combination.  Watch this video when  you get a chance!",967161600,,1057,4.545454545454546
3621711,5,B001GUYAZY,"One of Capra's best. Still as fresh and delightful as ever. One of the funniest of the screwball comedies and the ultimate battle of the sexes  (and of the classes) comedy. Less capraesque than his other classics,  namely `Mr. Smith Goes To Washington', `Mr. Deeds Goes to Town' and `It's a  Wonderful Life'. And Capra's usual Capra corn is toned down but still the  working middle class every man (Gable) is portrayed as the righteous hero  and rich and stuffy Colbert is portrayed as confused and stubborn. A  priceless comedy that hasn't aged one bit, it also features two of the  silver screen's greatest stars; Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. Filled  with lots of memorable scenes with Colbert and Gable's amusing verbal riffs  in between. The most memorable are the 'walls of Jericho'. Also with  memorable routines such as Gable showing Colbert how to 'dunk right',  teaching her 'how a man undresses', how to 'piggy back ride' and of course  their hitch-hiking travails that ends with the unforgettable image of  Colbert using her legs to get a ride proving once and for all that 'the  limb is mightier than the thumb'. Colbert and Gable were in peak form and  have rarely been better or funnier than here. Claudette Colbert has always  had and innocent sexiness to her personality and it is never more evident  than here, she is one of the 'cutest' of all the female screen legends.  Clark Gable is also excellent and his strong cinematic presence is greatly  appreciated, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Maybe it's  because Gable wasn't 'playing' the part of Peter Warren, Peter Warren 'was'  Gable. Probably the first great romantic comedy and still one of the best.  Along with Wilder's 'Some Like It Hot' this is as close as a comedy has  come to being called 'perfect'. Also famous for being the first picture to  win 'the top 5' Oscars which are best picture, director, actor, actress and  screenplay. This didn't happen again until 40 years later with 'One Flew  over the Cuckoo's Nest' and then 15 years later with 'The Silence Of The  Lambs'.

The picture quality is as good as you will find anywhere and the sound is  superb too. The DVD is also jam-packed with extra features. The film's  commentary is provided by Frank Capra Jr. He has a wonderfully relaxed  style and doesn't just sound as if he's reading from a prepared script.  Along with Ron Howard's commentary for Apollo 13, this is the best DVD  commentary I have heard to date. A special feature unique amongst DVDs must  be the radio version of 'It Happened One Night', first broadcast in 1939,  again starring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable.

3621716,5,B001GUYAZY,"More than any movie from the 1930s, this Frank Capra film has not dated at all. In spite of 60 plus years of ""romantic comedies"" which have followed ""It Happened One Night,"" it remains fresh and  laugh-out-loud funny. Clark  Gable is at his most charming as the scheming newspaper reporter who hopes  to get the inside scoop on the ""brat,"" played beautifully by Claudette  Colbert, who is on the run from her millionaire father. This Frank Capra  films still makes us laugh because he so humorously shows us that while men  and women are different, for some reason they can't live without one  another even though they can, as here, drive each other crazy. The  hitchhiking scene and the scene where Gable and Colbert pretend they are  married are timeless classics.  Columbia Classics has done a wonderful job  of presenting the best print we can probably expect 60 years on.  The disc  also contains a commentary from Capra's son, Frank Capra, Jr. and a  ""remembrance"" of the film. I cannot recommend this movie enough.",951782400,,1021,4.793103448275862

Clark Gable is just  right as the tough--and volnerable--reporter.

3621718,5,B001GUYAZY,"More than six decades after its original release, ""It Happened One Night"" still sparkles like a newly minted coin.  It's romantic, witty,  sophisticated ... and certain key scenes (especially Clark Gable's  gangster impression and Claudette Colbert's hitch-hiking lesson) remain  laugh-out-loud funny.  A near perfect blend of script, direction, and  performance, it deservedly swept the top five 1934 Academy Awards.  One  statue that it wasn't even nominated for, and  should have won, was for  Joseph Walker's Cinematography; his masterful camerawork makes this movie  glisten and shine.
The DVD transfer is amazingly beautiful.  There are a  few shots that appear to be slightly grainy and one or two jumps in the  soundtrack, but those are minor quibbles.  I've watched this film several  times over the past twenty years -- in a revival theatre, on satellite, and  on VHS -- and it's never looked as good as it does here. The DVD extras are  icing on the cake: trailers for this film and ""Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington""; the teaser for ""Lost Horizon""; a filmed  commentary by Frank Capra, Jr.; and the 1939 Lux Theatre radio broadcast of  the story.  I especially enjoyed the advertising archive section, which  included color reproductions of the original one-sheet posters and lobby  cards.  Overall, this disc is a great example of the DVD format at its  finest, and a most worthy presentation of a genuine Hollywood classic.",947894400,,1434,5.126086956521739
3621719,5,B001GUYAZY,"A thoroughly entertaining and beautifully acted battle of the sexes comedy classic. When Claudette Colbert finished making this film, she told her friends: ""I've just finished the worst picture in the world!"" She was nominated for an academy award and at the ceremonies,she was dressed in a traveling suit,ready to catch a train. Later in the evening, the French-born Colbert (31) was presented the academy award for the best actress of 1934 (six-year old Shirley Temple handed it to her). Gable, who was on suspension from Metro won for best actor. It was also the best picture, and Capra won as best director. The movie is actually noted for the fact that men's undershirt sales dwindled considerably when Gable revealed his bare chest! Although the film has a rather faded, dated air, it remains highly entertaining and strangely magical. I have high hopes for the yet-to-be released DVD print; CLARITY is just what this movie needs! I always get a kick out of Roscoe Karns who plays Oscar Shapely (Believe you me!) He says that remark to Ellie once to often and she replies heatedly ""Believe you me!-you bore me to distraction!"" Gable is usual terrific self as Pete Warne to which Ellie says ""Your ego is colassal"" to which Pete replies good naturedly ""Yeah....not bad.....How's yours?"" I felt Claudette could have been photographed in a more flattering way during the scene in which she tells Pete that she loves him - she looked almost unappealing. The mock fight scene is terrific as is the classic hitchhiking bit. Nobody could forgive Ellie for marrying that worm King Wesley - they REALLY made him something mealy and nasty.",944006400,,1634,4.902527075812275
