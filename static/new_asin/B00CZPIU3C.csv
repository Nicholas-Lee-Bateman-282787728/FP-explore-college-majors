It might help if you've seen Dorkness Rising to get an introduction to the characters.",1425859200,,259,4.777777777777778

8588034,5,B00CZPIU3C,"Join your favorite group of gamers as they quest for the legendary Vorpal Blender of Mordor, will they find it?  Will they fail?  And will Leo actually get through a session without dying 5 times (you all know the answer to that).

I was there at GEN CON 2012 during this and I had a blast.  I loved the audience interaction as well as the use of everything from fantasy, to Sci - Fi (yes there is a borg). Also was part of the filming of the ending scene for the new movie HANDS OF FATE that took place afterwards.  It is short, but fun to watch.  Pick it up and hope that this years Gen Con will have the release of the movie.",1397433600,,628,4.024193548387097
8588035,4,B00CZPIU3C,"Improv can be iffy stuff, but this has audience participation and some quirky delights. Of course, knowing something about this sort of gaming helps, but isn't necessary. A case in point - I know only something from the early Dungeons and Dragons days, but wasn't 'lost' when different character-types were suggested by the audience. A rollicking good type obviously was had by all, and that was fun to witness.",1396828800,,411,4.971014492753623
8588036,5,B00CZPIU3C,"I haven't been to a gamers' convention, but it sure looked like everyone was having a great time!  I love that they had lots of audience participation and the giant gaming dice.",1391558400,,177,4.53125
8588037,4,B00CZPIU3C,"Gotta love the ""Dead Gentlemen"". If you're a gamer, it's game on for this sorta cheaply done back room hotel conference center video. Production is ""cheap"", but the content is ""great"". So don't let it get ya down! Get on and watch as the guys improvise through a portion of a campaign, using parts of the audience in the process.

Good stuff!

(More movies though, please! ;) )",1382486400,,377,4.529411764705882
8588038,4,B00CZPIU3C,"I enjoyed this skit quite a bit, though I hadn't realized it was such an impromptu bit as it was.  I will admit however, my wife and I laughed a LOT while we watched it.",1380326400,2,169,3.8285714285714287
