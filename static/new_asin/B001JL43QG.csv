8313114,1,B001JL43QG,"I LOVE Mexican Movies with a twist of humor and everyday life. Yet, this film begs for quality story plots with a much more sophisticated touch of editing. I found this storyline vulgar, tasteless, and inappropriate for well-educated viewers. In other words, if a person was raised in a whore house, this film will fit his style perfectly. This MEXICAN film, although well-intended, is certainly NOT for me! Not for quality film seekers. Try: Tired of Kissing Frogs, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mama Tambien, El Estudiante, Rata de Dos Patas, 7 Dias, Ladron que roba a ladron, etc. Now, THESE movies deserve positive acknowledgement!!!!",1298678400,,628,5.048076923076923
