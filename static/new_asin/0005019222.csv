And what a great way to start! Patricia Neal gives a powerful performance as Olivia Walton, the head of the very large Walton clan.

This entire cast, in fact, seems ideally suited for his/her role in this film. The true feeling and spirit of the holiday shines through in every single scene of ""The Homecoming"", with the producers re-creating a very realistic feeling that it is indeed Christmas 1933, during the height of The Great Depression. The writing, acting, and the atmosphere are all first-rate.

This is one of those programs that begs to be watched every Christmas Eve, just like clockwork.

Who could forget the great scene at the end of the movie, when John (Daddy Walton, played by Andrew Duggan) tells the family of his encounter with Santa Claus. Watching him tell the kids of how Santa's sleigh ""...went flying across the sky and landed right on top of this house!!"", to me, is one of the best scenes in television history.

When viewing that realistic scene, you'd swear those children were not actors at all -- but just wide-eyed excited kids hanging on their father's every word.

In addition to the ""Santa's Sleigh"" scene I just mentioned, there are so many other memorable moments in this made-for-TV movie as well. Such as:

>> The kids hearing the sleigh bells when they're supposed to be asleep...thinking it's Santa Claus.

>> ""We've got to have some gas."" :)

>> The sleigh ride through the woods late on Christmas Eve, with the ""Baldwin Ladies"", John-Boy, and Hawthorne Dooley.

>> The tree decorating scene, punctuated by Mary Ellen calling her siblings ""a bunch of piss ants"". (I was always a little surprised that ""piss ants"" got past the CBS censors.) ;)

>> ""Are you smoking cigarettes up here, John-Boy??"" ~LOL~

>> Mary Ellen and John-Boy's private talk in the barn while John-Boy is milking the cow. ... ""They'll grow."" :)

>> John-Boy telling a Christmas story to his brothers and sisters on the stairs just before their daddy returns home.

>> When John-Boy finally confides in his mother, and reveals to her what his secret ambition is.

Every moment in this movie is to be treasured. Always.

---------------------------

""The Homecoming -- A Christmas Story"" will forever be one of the very best Christmas movies ever made, in my opinion.

Thank you, Earl Hamner Jr., for this timeless holiday staple.",1175817600,2,2644,5.19811320754717
