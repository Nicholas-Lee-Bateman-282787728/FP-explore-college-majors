This is obviously a British show, if it came only in the form that would play in Britain and NOT here, then the provider should have known that right away.  It was not stated anywhere.  I am disappointed that I could not see this video.
Shame on the provider for not giving out that information.  I definitely want my money back and I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from this place, as I don't feel i can trust them.",1377734400,,574,4.229357798165138
