6788859,5,B00P7ZD578,"Since this series first arrived on DVD, it has been presented in a ""cropped"" widescreen, manufactured for the DVD release. The series was filmed and telecast in full screen format, so anyone seeing this series on DVD has watched episodes that had the tops and bottoms of every shot (except the opening credits) made to appear to be in widescreen by actually covering parts of the picture with black bars on a standard television, and cropping those elements of each frame out to fill the screen of widescreen TV's. This release, the first to place the series on 4, instead of 3, discs, uses the fullscreen, 4:3 aspect ratio of the original telecasts - no cropping or fake widescreen! For those who may be surfing amazon, searching for a way to view this first remake of the classic soap opera series, THIS is the way to see it. For those who have been long-time fans, take the time to collect this edition, released by TGG DIRECT, LLC.",1422316800,15,935,4.604790419161676
8686670,4,B00P7ZD578,"This is the correct aspect ratio from the previous MGM release that had parts cropped out. The problem with this series in all its DVD forms is that it's not been completely released as it was on VHS. The VHS had extra footage on the pilot and finale as well as a lengthy documentary featuring interviews, behind the scenes footage, rare promos and other goodies. These should come to blu ray and DVD! As well as new interviews and retrospectives.",1506470400,2,447,4.6
8686671,5,B00P7ZD578,"I am a fan from way back of the original series and didn't think I would like it, but I felt lost after I watched all the originals and bought this on a whim. Once I got into a couple episodes I enjoyed the slightly different twist on the old stories and really enjoyed it. I was sad there wasn't more.",1504828800,,302,3.9672131147540983
8686672,4,B00P7ZD578,"This set is an Excellent Vampire Series.  Old legends stile.

Barnabas Collins sleeps deeply in the Daytime, completely helpless until sunset.  He can't deny the blood lust, it's overwhelming.  To him vampirism is a curse.  He's cursed to eternal isolation.  Eternal self loathing.  Eternally feared and hunted. Eternally forced to attack others and commit other acts that sicken, repulse, and terrify him.  His existence is one he can't live with, yet he's denied death.

Barnabas had been turned during the late 1700's.  Shortly afterwards he'd been entombed.  Sealed in a stone coffin strong enough to withstand Vampire Strength.  Once released he feeds several times, then proceeds to make a life for himself.  The Collins family still prospered in the area.  All were descendants of Barnabas's little brother.  Claiming to be his own descendant Barnabas fits himself into the family and reclaims the original Collins Manor.

As the saga continues Barnabas falls for a Doppelganger of His Long Lost Fiance Josette.  Victoria, the doppelganger, may very well have been Josette's reincarnation.

The following adventures have Barnabas spawning some Vamps, and them being slain.  An evil witch surfaces and so do a some ghosts.  A few seances are performed, with disastrous results.  Finally this has Victoria travelling into the past, and eventually returning to her present.",1496361600,,1377,5.341121495327103

8686675,3,B00P7ZD578,"The series was ok, not great, but not terrible, either.  I know with ratings down they had to cancel the series, but I do wish they had done maybe one more episode to tie up the story and not just drop it.  Very irritating.",1456099200,,223,4.045454545454546

8686677,5,B00P7ZD578,"It's been a long wait (10 years!) but at long last, ""DARK SHADOWS '91"" is available in the proper FULL SCREEN aspect ratio!  THIS is the version to buy - AVOID the 2005 MGM edition (which was inexplicably released in cropped / fake Widescreen).  This 4 disc DVD released by TGG Direct, LLC  and MGM is the real deal - FULL SCREEN!  This DVD set is NOT a bootleg - this is NOT a MOD (made-on-demand) - this is a legit DVD release.  This set comes in a slightly over-sized Box with two ordinary sized DVD cases inside, labeled ""Dark Shadows"" Volume 1 and ""Dark Shadows"" Volume 2.  Each Volume features two DVD's.  The artwork on each Volume (as well on as the DVD's themselves) is the same as the outer box (pictured in Amazon's product listing).

The picture and sound quality of this DVD set is absolutely AMAZING!  I have no idea if any restoration work was done, but ""DARK SHADOWS '91"" has never looked or sounded better!

I think this DVD release slipped past almost everyone...just a hunch, but I have a feeling that this will go OOP (out of print) fairly quickly.  Don't hesitate to BUY this exceptional DVD release from Amazon today!  5 Stars all the way for TGG Direct and MGM!",1447113600,5,1184,4.430555555555555

8686679,1,B00P7ZD578,I ordered this at Christmas.  When I unwrapped it on Christmas morning I found that it was irreparably damaged - all 4 discs were scratched.  I had to return it.  I'm a little gun-shy about ordering it again.,1427328000,,208,4.421052631578948
