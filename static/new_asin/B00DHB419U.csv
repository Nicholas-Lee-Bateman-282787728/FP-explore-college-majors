5798876,5,B00DHB419U,"This movie rocks with action! It had interpersonal conflicts that Percy resolves by saving the day once again. He even gives credit to someone else and lets them take the bow, so to speak.
I understand that this is a younger person book series and that is just the kind of lighter movie theme that I wanted to see. Well Done!",1376265600,,325,4.344262295081967
5798877,5,B00DHB419U,"As a real fan of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series of books, I was somewhat disappointed with the first Percy Jackson movie because it strayed too much from the storyline and didn't have the right group dynamic between the characters.  This second movie is much better, in my opinion, because it really draws you in by following the storyline from the book that made me want to read all seven books (multiple times!).  This movie is great fun, and very exciting, with lots of twists and turns and special effects - I especially like the cab ride!

All in all, this movie is extremely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it for the whole family.",1376092800,173,644,4.631578947368421
5798878,5,B00DHB419U,"I am a big fan of Logan Lerman (Percy) and I am pleased to say that, just like every other movie he's in, Logan failed miserably to disappoint.  His acting was phenomenal as usual. He is a brilliant actor that can play any type of roll perfectly. AS was the rest for the cast, very well done.  I was a little disappointed that they re-cast Pierce Brosnan's role.  But maybe they needed the money for effects.  Which by the way where breathtaking.  The story was very personal and oriented toward loyalty and the importance of family. The baddies where satisfyingly scary and very well rendered in CGI (you couldn't do these kinds of creatures with live action models)  and they had a wicked sense of humor.  I like that Percy was not seen as everyone's idol, more as a normal person. He wasn't held up on a pedestal or anything.  Overall I think this was a worthy sequel to another brilliant movie.  A+!",1375920000,34,903,4.49079754601227
5798879,1,B00DHB419U,"As far as the film genre of sci-fi fantasy goes, it might be time to say enough is enough - for the time being, at least.  Between Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, The Host, Beautiful Creatures, and any other franchise with a bunch of teen drama and whacky creatures running amuck, it's pretty safe to say the films of this particular genre are growing increasingly stale.  This genre of film has gotten so ridiculously predictable that if you've seen Harry Potter, you've essentially already seen the Twilight films and so on and so forth.  Seriously, how many different stories can possibly be told about the ""chosen one?""  Each and every one of these films, including a beloved franchise like Star Wars, recycles the same old story about prophecy and destiny to the point that you'd think these authors and filmmakers would be tired of making stories about the same old thing.  Come to think of it, it's no wonder authors, like J.K. Rowling, Stephanie Meyer, and Rick Riordan, have all been named in plagiarism lawsuits in recent years.  When everyone's stories look alike, sound alike, and end alike - what did they expect to happen?  And, speaking of recycled stories - Percy Jackson is back with the film series' second installment, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.

Based on the novel of the same name (by Rick Riordan), Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is directed by Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and stars Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson - the demigod son of Poseidon.  An attack penetrates the walls of Camp Half-Blood, forcing Percy, his newfound Cyclops half-brother, Tyson (Douglas Smith), and his friends, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), to leave the camp on a mission to retrieve the Golden Fleece to restore the mystical barrier.  Meanwhile, Percy's former friend and current nemesis, Luke (Jake Abel), has his own plans as he and his followers are also on a mission to secure the fleece.  Leven Rambin, Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion, and Anthony Head also star in supporting roles.

In all honesty, Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief provided a great deal of entertainment - incorporating the gods of Greek mythology into present day.  While the first Percy Jackson film greatly resembled the events of the early Harry Potter films, the Percy Jackson character still had a great deal to offer regardless of the easy comparisons.  Like Potter, Jackson struggled with the idea that the world was full of mythical beings, along with the weight of being the ""chosen one.""  Also like Potter, he relied heavily on his friends to help guide him through his journey and to help him become this potentially great leader of ""destiny.""  Unfortunately, the main problems with Percy Jackson is he's not as popular as Harry Potter, doesn't have the drive or ambition of Frodo, and his sword isn't as cool as a lightsaber.  And frankly, his sidekicks - Grover and Annabeth - are not nearly as loveable as Ron and Hermione.

On paper, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters provides a solid, well thought out storyline.  The idea of Percy Jackson being challenged again after the showdown in New York is an inevitable occurrence, but the problem with the sequel is that he was challenged too much in the first film and not challenged enough in the sequel.  In the first film, there's a massively threatening potential from the Greek gods to go to war with one another.  Let's be honest, the second film's plot relies solely on the journey to acquire a blanket.  That's right - the majority of this film follows these powerful characters as they travel across the United States to find a blanket, which happens to be resting on the shoulder of a giant, grumpy Cyclops - who lives in an amusement park.  The last film had lightning, gods, and a trip to Hades, while this sequel has absurd, blind taxi drivers, followed by an eventual trip to the oceanic version of the Pit of Sarlacc (from Return of the Jedi for those that don't know).  Sadly, there's no Boba Fett - or Amelia Earhart, in the belly of this water-based beast.

Most (not all) bad movies at least have a few positives to admire.  Although admiration probably isn't the right word to use, but in any event, this film does have an early visit from a pretty sweet Transformer-like bull that shoots fire and does some major damage to Camp Half-Blood.  When Michael Bay gets a look at this thing, he'll probably wish he would have thought of it first - possibly having it transform from a Red Bull delivery truck (after all, product placement and transformers go hand-in-hand).  Aside from the bull, this sequel is also paid a visit from not one, but two Buffy: The Vampire Slayer alums.  Anthony Head takes over for the inexplicably absent Pierce Brosnan in the role of Chiron and Nathan Fillion plays the role of Hermes, the messenger of the gods who poses amusingly as a glorified UPS clerk.  Regardless, it would appear someone in the casting department has some deep admiration for Joss Whedon.

It's clear the Percy Jackson novels have a substantial fan base, and 99 percent of the time, a film is unable to fully grasp the emotion of a novel.  The knock on this film has nothing to do with the novels, which have attained their own praise and devotion.  Still, it's painfully obvious this film sequel bumbles around from beginning to end, feeling unorganized and at times - just downright fake.  The CGI in the film is nothing to write home about, and while the cast is moderately entertaining (due largely to the addition of the mean-spirited character work of Leven Rambin), they still cannot make up for the poorly adapted script and bad direction.  Thor Freudenthal takes over for the Harry Potter alum, Chris Columbus - and it shows.

Unfortunately for the Percy Jackson film franchise, this sequel loses any kind of ""mojo"" that was built in the first film, inevitably leading to this this dreadful and at times unbearable sequel.  The addition of a female lead, a bunch of zombies, and a golden blanket are simply not enough to maintain the average level of entertainment provided in the series' predecessor.  Still, the readers of Percy Jackson are ages 10 and up, so kids will easily find more entertainment in this film than adults.  The absence of the gods, Hollywood star power - not to mention an actual sea of monsters, is detrimental to the outcome of this film.  If you haven't yet invested in this film franchise, do yourself a favor and keep it that way.  But, if you're looking to acquaint yourself with Percy Jackson - hit the books.

5798880,5,B00DHB419U,"Here we go with the second chapter of this popular series, based on the book by Rick Riordan, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Sea of Monsters. This time directed by Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") whose main job here seems to be producing Computer Generated Images... A movie based on a book this fantastical HAS to include CGI, so I'm not complaining...this time. Plus I appreciate the fact that kids are referred back to Greek mythology to read about the Golden Fleece.

The invisible shield that protects the half-bloods' safe haven has evaporated because the tree that created it is dying. Their only hope is the Golden Fleece because of its restorative powers.

Here they are again:
  * Logan Lerman (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") is Percy, our dauntless half-blood (his father is Poseidon, God of the Sea). He can (sometimes) control the seas...
  * Alexandra Daddario (""Percy Jackson: Lightening Thief""), Annabeth is determined to retrieve the Golden Fleece. She is sort of a Hogwarts Hermione: she READS!
  * Nathan Fillian (""Much Ado About Nothing"") surprises us as a UPS guy/Hermes. His son Luke is mad at him... But he gives our hero some terrific packing tape!
  * Stanley Tucci (""Hunger Games"") is Dionysus. Zeus is still mad, so he turns his wine into water. He has heard Christians have a god who can do the reverse...""Now THERE is a God!""
  * Brandon T. Jackson (""Tropic Thunder"") is cloven-hoofed Grover, another half-blood and a loyal pal.
  * Jake Abel (""I Am Number Four"") is Hermes' son Luke; he looks like a young Kevin Bacon! He has serious daddy issues and goes to the Dark Side.

This has a PG rating, so expect no nudity, no profanity, a bit of vehicular mayhem in a taxi (three hags driving it share one eyeball), lots of swordplay and fisticuffs but no blowie uppie stuff. There is a great storm at sea, though.

I've asked Amazon to notify me when the DVD is available.",1375401600,129,1918,4.697604790419161

5799035,1,B00DHB419U,"The sequel isn't as good - and it's not ""just"" the curse of sequels. The characters struggle with things they were more than capable of dealing with in the first movie. The effects are far inferior to the first movie.
The female characters in particular have come down significantly in value. The main female lead (Annabeth) has gone from a capable warrior to shrieking sidekick with a prejudice and contributes very little this time around with strategy, skill or knowledge. She's regularly physically overcome despite the precedents set in the first movie. The new female semi-lead (Clarice) is demonstrated as out-doing the guys, but is portrayed as a ball-buster in the process.

The number of outrageous and ridiculous characters has ballooned. It's not the fantasy aspect - I don't mind fantasy and enjoy it in some movies. It's the outright slapstick humor. The little asides about the new guardian character introduced contribute little or nothing to the movie and should have stayed in the book. The strong Chiron character from the first movie has evolved into a shuffling Brit instead of staying somewhat similar if the other actor was unavailable or uninterested.

I'm incredibly happy that we only rented this one, and didn't buy it.
Usually we watch movies a couple of times pretty quickly together, picking up on extra details or just for the enjoyment. This one was easy to walk away from for a drink or the dogs instead of pausing, and we only got about a third of the way through a second viewing before just shutting it off and letting the rental expire.
It's a shame, because after the first, the potential was there for a series we'd really like, and we adore a lot of the actors in this film.",1492732800,2,1714,4.806779661016949

Pros: Action, some humorous parts, familial bonding. Kids may like it, which means you can start mythological dialogue.

Cons: Still with the mommy/daddy issues. Some continuity errors. The part with Hermes was little weird (kinda funny too). The parts with Clarisse get a little annoying.

Advice: See if it's on cable/satellite tv and watch it there first.",1474156800,,626,4.831775700934579

5799257,3,B00DHB419U,"The first movie was meh, it lacked heart.  This one shows some heart and that heart is centered around the goodly-natured Tyson, the cyclopean half-brother to Percy.  He lends humanity to their task and his undaunted spirit makes their treacherous sojourn bearable.  Otherwise this would just be another group of demi-gods who have parent issues and have to go on some quest spfx movie with no real heart, like the first one.  Though that mechanical bull that rampaged through their training ground was kinda cool.  3.5 stars",1466726400,,525,4.988505747126437

5799259,3,B00DHB419U,The book is always better.  In the movie things happen that don't happen until like 3 books later.  I am not a huge fan of that but the movie was okay I suppose.,1466467200,,161,3.8484848484848486

5799275,4,B00DHB419U,"It was a fun movie, but a little confusing, unless you are steeped in Greek mythology.  A great followup to the previous movie, the Lightning Thief.",1465776000,,148,4.6923076923076925
5799276,3,B00DHB419U,"Basically, if you don't like movies that deviate completely from the books, then this movie is not for you. I am fan of the original books, and was tempted to give the movie one star simply for how they butcher the story of the original books, just like in the first movie. However, this is a movie review, not a how well they followed the book review. And in truth, they did do a better job at following the story than they did in the first movie (It would've been hard not to). Overall the movie is realitively good. The acting is above average, the effects are very good. There are a decent number of plot holes and things that plain didn't make sense in this altered story which bothered me, but overall it was an okay plot. I would recommend renting this movie if you are fan of the books before buying it, if you love it great, if not, you'll most likely spend 2 hours of your life in a pulse pounding, face reddening, on the verge of trying to kill anyone involved with the creation of this movie, fury, but hey, that's fun too.",1465689600,,1035,4.258883248730965
5799277,1,B00DHB419U,"These movies are so far from the books, the only thing that relates are the names of the characters. Personalities are different, story lines changed. Do not be fooled into thinking it aligns with the books such as Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter - though they have their differences from the books as well, they still captured the essence. Sean of Monsters fails.",1465689600,,366,4.6461538461538465

This movie was better than the first one. Percy is back with his friends and a new brother. He is once again on a quest but this time without permission which means he could be in big trouble if he is caught. Introducing more characters from the series and more monsters and gods as well it makes this movie a lot of fun especially if you love mythology it's a lot of fun seeing modern versions of the ancient gods.

I purchased this movie as a gift for my son. He has read all of the books and absolutely LOVES them and has wanted to see the movie for quite a while. We all sat and watched the movie Christmas evening after all of our holiday festivities were done. I am not usually impressed by movies based on literature. The movies usually miss important aspects and details from the written story. We were all impressed with this movie and how much of the book was included. All of us, those who have already read the book and those of us who haven't, were impressed by the movie, it's story, and it's special effects. This movie is worth taking the time to watch. I also love that my children are learning some of te basic aspects of Greek mythology and don't even know it.",1452470400,,859,4.477707006369426

5799434,5,B00DHB419U,"The first book in the series was made into a terrible film, but the producers learned their lesson and made a second film closer to the spirit of the book that inspired it. Annabeth and Clarisse are  better characters and Grover is toned down, and the entire set is created with more care ( and expense)  As in most films it is the details that create a believable world and some of the details that deserve special praise are the Oracle's animation of the Titan War, Annabeth's Book, the snakes of Hermes staff, and the beautiful Hippocampi.  Readers want films that bring their beloved books to life, and this film does just that.  Let's hope that further installments in the series will continue to do the same,",1451260800,,714,4.5984251968503935

5799550,5,B00DHB419U,"It's been three years since Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman), one of the new Half-Bloods--children of the old Greek gods (his father is Poseidon, the god of the sea)--saved Olympus and perhaps the world, and he's beginning to wonder if it was all just a flash in the pan, or at best a one-shot wonder.  Certainly he's still living at Camp Half-Blood, where young demigods like himself learn to use their powers and fight the creatures that threaten the gods' good order--including the Cyclopes that haunt the surrounding forest.  All that keeps them off is a powerful magical field generated by Thalia's Tree, the miraculous oak created when one of the monsters mortally wounded Zeus's young daughter Thalia and he ""found another way for her to live.""  But now, suddenly, the field is beginning to fail, letting in a fantastic (and very Steampunkish) brass bull that's half magical and half mechanical.  Percy and his fellow-pupils manage to destroy it, but it soon becomes clear that Thalia-the-tree is dying.  Only one thing can save her: the Golden Fleece--which is hidden somewhere in the Sea of Monsters, known to ordinary mortals as the Bermuda Triangle.  Chiron (Anthony Head), the centaur, and Mr. D., aka Dionysus (Stanley Tucci), decide that Percy's great rival, Clarisse (Leven Rambin), a daughter of Ares, must go in search of it.  But Percy has discovered that someone else is looking for it too--Luke (Jake Abel), a son of Hermes (Nathan Fillion), whose anger at his father's neglect of him has turned him against all the gods.  Then he meets an oracle (Shoreh Aghdashloo) who tells him why: Luke plans to resurrect Kronos (Robert Knepper), the father of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, whom the trio, thousands of years ago, defeated and killed (as much as an immortal being can be killed) and locked in a chest that bears a sneaking resemblance to the Ark of the Covenant.  If he succeeds, not only will Olympus fall, but the world itself may end.  And only a child of one of Kronos's original conquerors can forestall him.  Percy is the only such that anyone knows about--except his newly discovered half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith), a Cyclops of a new order.  So the two boys, accompanied by Percy's friend Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), a daughter of Athena, set out to find the Fleece before Luke can--with a little help from Hermes and, offstage, Poseidon himself.

Viewers of the previous movie in the franchise will figure out (although it's not specified) that Zeus has rescinded his decree barring contact between the gods and their demi-mortal offspring, since Clarisse is able to petition Ares to equip her for her search (which he does).  Despite a somewhat derivative nature (I could discern elements similar to Narnia, Harry Potter, and LOTR), the movie succeeds splendidly on its own.  Percy, Tyson, and Annabeth are sympathetic but not perfect, and even Luke and Clarisse are somehow understandable.  The special effects, of course, are splendid, especially the brass bull, the hippocampus Tyson summons to get the trio out to Luke's yacht, Clarisse's Civil-War-vintage submarine (with a crew of zombie Confederate seamen!), Charbydis, and the climactic battle with Kronos.  The score isn't bad either.  This is another of those movies that prove a sequel doesn't always have to suffer by comparison with the original.",1437004800,,3343,5.047272727272727

I really thought that I wasn't going to enjoy it, but both my husband and I enjoyed watching it so much with our 6 and 8 year old grandchildren that we rented Sea of Monsters, the second in the series.  Having never read the books, I have no idea how the stories differ, they always do when a book is made into a movie.  The only thing I can say is that we all enjoyed watching a bit of Greek Mythology come to life on the screen.  I have to laugh because by the end of the movie, the children were asleep (they've seen it before) and my husband and I were engrossed until the very end!

5799582,4,B00DHB419U,"Its been several years since I read the second book in the Percy Jackson series.  In fact, I read it not too long after the first movie came out.  And considering how close the original book and movie were (not very), I didn't bother rereading the book before seeing Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.  Im sure that was a wise decision.

Now, if you are new to the franchise completely, you would actually be okay to jump in here.  There are really two prologs to the movie, one that gives the back story and one that sets up some of the action in this movie.  Briefly, Percy is a demigod, specifically the son of Poseidon.  He lives in modern day New York State, but there are plans afoot to over throw the gods of Mount Olympus.

Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is settling into his new life at Camp Half-Blood, the only safe place for demigods.  Or so they think.  One night at dinner, the camp is attacked by a mechanical bull, and the campers discover that the tree that protects the camp has been poisoned.

Percys friend Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) is certain that only one thing can save the tree and their camp  the mythical Golden Fleece.  Even though their nemesis in the camp, Clarisse (Leven Rambin), is sent out on the quest to find it, Percy, Annabeth, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson), and Percys half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith) sneak out and attempt to find it on their own.  The last known location was in the Sea of Monsters, better known to us mortals as the Bermuda Triangle.  But when their paths cross with an old foe, the quest takes on an even more urgent tone.  Can they find the fleece in time?

I remember enough of the book that I can already hear fans of the series screaming out about the inconsistencies.  The only one that really annoyed me was Tyson.  Hes a Cyclops, and the book makes it clear that, while not full grown, he is bigger than Percy and the others.  Here, hes the same size.  They also changed a certain prophecy since the gap between movies being released in real life has made the original timing from the books impossible.

Basically, just know this.  If you watch this movie, pretend the book never existed and youll be fine.  Otherwise, youll just be nitpicking apart the film from start to finish.  The book is not fresh enough in my mind to do that, which I think is probably a huge blessing.

But if you are able to watch this as a film itself, youll certainly enjoy it.  After a bit of a slow start, things quickly pick up.  The moment our heroes leave on the quest, the story really gets interesting, and it held my attention until the end.  There are several good action sequences and twists to keep anyone entertained.

I do wonder, however, how they will handle the climax of this movie and the plot of the next book if the movie franchise goes forward.  In attempts to wrap some things up in case the movie series doesn't continue, they might also be writing themselves into a corner.

I found it interesting that most of the adult actors changed between movies.  That meant we get to see the likes of Nathan Fillion and Anthony Stewart Head in roles others played last time.  I didn't mind; in fact, I enjoyed seeing them in the movie.  The main cast (Percy and his friends) are the same.  Everyone does a good job with the acting.

However, lets talk special effects.  As you might imagine, the monsters make the film rather effects heavy.  Some work, but for the most part you can tell that the characters are interacting with something fake.  The opening scene, in fact, looks so fake even the actors looked CGI to me.  On the other hand, Tysons one eye face was spectacular.  Revolting but spectacular.  And some other sequences in the film were just as much fun because of good effects.

In the end, yes I recommend Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.  It is a fun pop corn flick that kids and their parents can enjoy together.  Just don't expect much faithfulness to the book and youll be just fine.",1434240000,,3958,4.480392156862745

With Sea of Monsters this new director turns things around and brings us a sequel that improves upon the original in almost every possible way.

*What I liked:*
Most of the things fans complained about in the original (merging Clarisse and Annabeth for one) have been fixed. Annabeth is back to being a rather snarky, bookish girl who can hold her own in a fight without emulating an Amazon and Clarisse appears.

The score is not memorable but is definitely riveting while watching the film and is beautiful at times.

They actually manage to bring together important elements from the books that were neglected in the first, such as Annabeth, Grover, Luke and Thalia and Dionysus.

Everything seems put together this time, as if the director and screenwriter actually cared.

*What I didn't like:*
Many elements have been changed from the book, mostly for the sake of pacing (the fight in ""Circeland"" was by far the biggest departure, as well as Tyson's appearance. He's not ugly, he's a regular looking young man with one eye, where in the book he's pretty much Quasimodo without the hump). They did add in a motion comic to fill in a new back story for Tyson, so that was nice. Also, the prophecy is about a 20 year old, not a 16 year old like in the books.

They still left out any mention of Pan or Grover's quest.

It ends on a huge reveal (book fans know what it is) but there is no sequel in sight.

I'm hoping a sequel gets announced soon.",1428192000,,1682,4.543046357615894

5799668,5,B00DHB419U,"I am a historical buff of ancient folklore, especially Greek & Roman mythology.  This and the first Percy was an extremely entertaining entry
into these types of tales of ancient heroes, gods and demi-gods and such fantasies.  These films are wonderfully produced, terrific special effects
and beautiful photography.  A good cast, good acting and very cute girls (good!) though I miss  the beauty from the first film.  This one ends with
a suggestion of a third movie but I guess that is not  going to happen.  I did buy the book set but have yet to read them.  I am told the first movie
changed the story a bit, but I liked it well.  The only error as far as the gods go is the name of Heracles.  In Greek it is Heracles, not Hercules, the
Roman name.  A minor point but if you have read any of my other reviews, I like to be right on accurate.  But all the kids are charming, the young
Cyclops very likeable and added to it a Iron Clad left over from the Civil War (neat!).  The Sea Monsters are only in the film for a rather limited time
but it was well done.  Kronos as you might know was the  father of the Gods, but decided to devour them.  But they were gods and could not die;
and later extracted revenge.  This is the second movie recently that told a story about evil trying to revive Kronos.  Good luck, that!  Anyhow, for
fantasy and myth lovers this should found very entertaining.  FIVE STARS; good fun without the vulgarity that is present in most movies today.
I got my DVDs from Amazon as ususal.  Recommend this highly.  Enjoy!",1425513600,,1545,4.347368421052631

5799707,3,B00DHB419U,"Just finished watching ""Percy Jackson - Sea Of Monsters"" released by 20th Century Fox.
I can't help but thinking that ""Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters"" is another example of why some books are best left unmade into movies.
Percy Jackson is having issues with Poseidon - he wants to have some quality time with his absent father - who resolves the issue by sending Percy his unexpected half-brother to Camp Halfblood.  Doesn't help the issue that Percy's newly acquired half-brother is a cyclops.  Oh that Poseidon.
If family matters weren't enough, Percy is starting to doubt himself and there seems to be a prophecy that suggests he's going to be responsible for death and destruction on a widespread scale.
Into this mix throw Luke, who is out to overthrow Zeus and the rest of the Olympians and restore the Titans to power.
So when someone else is chosen to go off on a quest to recover the Golden Fleece, Percy and his friends go off on their own to recover it.
The magice of the books are not in this movie, which is sad.  But I don't think the books translate well into movies.  Just my opinion.
Recommended only for fans for the series.

5799725,2,B00DHB419U,"I read the books. So inaccurate. Luke wasn't on the island with them,the Hydra appeared in the 2nd book, not the first.  Chiron was supposed to be banished because the gods thought he did it. Grover was looking for Pan, the lost god of the wild and got trapped with Polyphemus or how ever it's spelled. Circe trapped herself. Them in her theme park that wasn't built on  Polyphemus's island. I love the books, and I could name so many more flaws with this movie. Like this: Luke's boat was called The Princess Andromeda, it held monsters, and mortals, and the mortals were in a trance. Clarisse had rescued them from their battle with the Hydra, and it was only a baby. Annabeth's hair was blonde in the first book. Oh, and where's Ares, he didn't make an appearance in the first movie like he was supposed to! Hermes visited Percy on the beach in camp. Tyson met Percy at school during the year, he was homeless and the school payed for his tuition as a community project. I guess Ares was more forgotten than I thought in the first movie, Clarisse didn't make an appearance at all! And I heard Zendaya is the actress for Bianca in the next movie? Wow.

5799805,3,B00DHB419U,"I remember hating The Lightning Thief movie as an adaptation, because it was so unfaithful to the book. To quote myself I don't honestly know how it got away with it because not only did they miss out loads but changed the remainder so that it barely resembled the book and this meant that I reluctantly watched this movie anticipating them to slaughter it. However I was pleasantly surprised

It was no award-winning movie and will never be one of my favourites, but anything could have been better than my poorer than dirt expectations. Following a little more faithfully to Rick Riordans book it was enjoyable, but I would say that if you detested the first with a passion keep away from the movie franchise. I don't even know if they got enough profit to warrant its continuation. Nevertheless this movie was a way for the producers and directors to redeem themselves in the eyes of the books fans, which they did in a way.

It was still filled with cheesy one-liners and countless faults, including little things like Clarise and Percy not constantly at each others throats; as well as more significant things like Grovers mission to find Pan and the scene at Siren Bay. This wasn't just an important bonding moment for Annabeth and Percy but for the viewer, and also leads on to the questioning of our heroes fatal flaws.

Overall though it wasn't a complete flop, so long as you don't take it too seriously and go in with quite low expectations, but I will always love the books no matter what the movie producers come out with and Im glad they cant change that.

5799917,3,B00DHB419U,"As a fan of the book series, I have to say that I have been disappointed in both movie installments- but Sea of Monsters was even worse than The Lightning Thief. I took a chance on this second movie adaptation because I had read that the screenplay writers had taken feedback from the first movie seriously, and had decided to stick more closely to the story line in the book as a result. So I actually looked forward to this movie quite a bit. Maybe the anticipation made the disappointment worse, I'm not sure.
I liked the first movie, even though it really did not follow the book very faithfully, It came much closer than SoM in my opinion. There were several problems with SoM-. Too many added scenes, not enough of the actual story, and poor character development were just a few of the things that made this movie just an okay way to spend a couple of hours. If you are looking for something that mirrors Rick RIordan's amazing story, my advice is stick to reading and leave the movie alone. If you just like teen action/fantasy and haven't read the books, this movie may be for you.",1406246400,5,1090,4.455

Tyson is there, and they made his character out to be fairly smart, no rocket scientist or anything, but not as dumb as a stump or anything. I liked that about the movie.

You have to give credit to the creative license the screen writers had to take to make the book in to a movie. I think they did an fantastic job. I still think you should read the book even if you watch the movie. Books just give you so much more back story.

This movie is well worth watching and buying. Great for a large age range, you pre-teens and young teens will probably enjoy this movie, and as an adult I liked it too.",1401667200,,777,4.071895424836601

One can't take it seriously, of course, but then it isn't meant as a ""serious"" movie; it's just a fun take on the old myths.

Suffice it to say that that your money is better spent elsewhere; if you love your child, then buy them the boxed set of 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians', or any of Rick Riordan's books for that matter, and help them to enjoy reading. That would be a much greater value for the money, as the books are far superior to these badly made movies.

The whole movie followed the plot line to the 2nd book---ish.. but when is came time for the conclusion of the movie they wrapped book 3,4 and 5 into the last 20 mins as well...

I literally remember laughing and sitting there thinking to myself what the hell is going on. They screwed up with the movie, including the first one, when they tried to change too many things from the book. I always give so much respect to Rowling because she told WB, its my way or the highway when we make these movies.

5800023,3,B00DHB419U,"I thought this movie might be a good demo disc for my tweaked home theater system and indeed it was.  More on that later.  As far as the movie, I have fading memory of the first film in this series (""The Lightning Thief) of a few years ago.  I liked the premise of Greek gods coupling with humans, and in one case here with a nymph cyclops.  The offspring are known as half-bloods.

Returning to the series is Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson, Brandon T. Jackson as satyr Grover and Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth.  The half-bloods live in a village protected by an invisible barrier.  The barrier is penetrated by a mechanical bull under the control of a once friend, Luke (Jake Abel) who has some idea of resurrecting the late, great god, Kronos (Robert Knepper).  In order to repair the barrier, our trio and Peter's new half-brother cyclops Tyson (Douglas Smith) and queen bee in training, Clarisse (Leven Rambin) head off in search for the Golden Fleece.

A series of monsters, not to mention Luke and his gang get in their way of course.  It's been a couple days since I've seen this movie and much of the detail is beginning to fade.  So, while this is an entertaining film, it will probably be most appreciated for the younger crowd.  The thing I remember most is seeing Ms. Daddario for the first time since her role on HBO's ""True Detective"" as the no-holds-barred paramour of Woody Harrelson's character.

As noted earlier, the Blu ray disc is a visual and audio delight.  With a 1080p transfer and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film is quite bold with the use of color.  The CGI aspects, of which there are plenty, are a tad soft, but certainly not offensive.  The audio is where the film really shines.  The disc has a DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  It provides a thunderous LFE channel and an aggressive surround mix.  Terrific stuff.  Audio tracks are available in French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Estonian, Hindi, Latvian, Lithuanian, Mandarin, Russian and Ukrainian.  Four short information pieces are included (Tyson Motion Comic, Deconstructing a Demigod, Back to Camp Half-Blood, It's All in the Eye) as well as a couple of trailers.",1399334400,,2259,4.782945736434108

The actors are still good, and some of the special effects are thrilling. 3-D is an added bonus. Logan Lerman appears a little more mature than in the first movie.

5800069,3,B00DHB419U,"Maybe I need to pick up Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson stories again, give 'em another shot. When I first started reading the series years ago, in my eyes, it suffered from the ""Well, it's no Harry Potter"" syndrome. Annabeth Chase seemed like a straight-up clone of Hermione Granger. But this movie - Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters - won't be the decider for me. It's fairly blas&eacute; about some of its departures from the source material.

In this surprising sequel - surprising, because I didn't think there'd be a sequel - Percy (Logan Lerman) is in the midst of a funk, second-guessing his demigod street cred as a hero, wondering if he was only good for one quest. Doesn't help that his dad, the Greek god Poseidon, seems to have abandoned him and that his chief rival at Camp Half-Blood, Ares's boastful offspring Clarisse (Leven Rambin), is on his case 24/7. But when the enchanted tree that safeguards Camp Half-Blood is poisoned, a quest is proposed to obtain the one remedy, the fabled Golden Fleece, a quest that can only be undertaken by Camp Half-Blood's finest heroes. So off goes Perc- wait... what?... Oh, bummer. Okay, so off goes Clarisse on her monumental mission, making her way to the terrifying Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle, to you and me).

Good for Percy, he doesn't spend too much time sulking. Concern for Clarisse and her mission compels him to embark on his own expedition for the Golden Fleece, and, of course, Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) is with him and their cautious satyr pal Grover (Brandon T. Jackson). They're unexpectedly joined by Percy's newly discovered, hobo-like half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith). Tyson is a cyclops, a sweet oaf, and is probably my favorite character here. He exudes this appealing childlike sense of wonder, and I like the refreshing twist of Tyson's not having any emotional baggage against Percy. He genuinely appreciates having him for a brother. Conversely, it takes Percy a minute longer to appreciate Tyson.

One character who doesn't give a fig about family drama is the treacherous Luke Castellan (Jake Abel). He's back and he nurses his own plans for the Golden Fleece. Note that Luke is no tree hugger.

This is a 3 out of 5 star flick for me. It's enjoyable on a surface level. Seems to me that the narrative is there mostly to service the special effects. The CG stuff is mostly solid and, in spots, even imaginative. I said ""mostly"" because I did find the mechanical Colchis Bull at the start not so convincing, the Kronos rendering pretty laughable, and the goofy Chariot of Damnation - resembling a slovenly New York taxi cab - recalls the Knight Bus from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The young cast turns in dedicated performances; I don't really blame them (Okay, Grover is pretty grating). It's too bad they're given crap dialogue to read:

- Annabeth, held captive: ""You used to be one of us!""
- Luke: ""And then I woke up.""

Pros:

- awesome Nathan Fillion cameo
- the mythical tape and the thermos of wind (Greek mythology's answer to those 007 spy gadgets)
- zombie sailors
- no tired sibling rivalry between Percy and Tyson
- and, as always, Percy's pen that transforms into a magic sword

Cons:

- contrived character beats
- by-the-numbers plot
- done-to-death themes (the quest, the prophesy, the hero of destiny, etc.)
- Annabeth and Grover are pretty useless in this one
- I mentioned Tyson's sense of wonder, but the film itself eschews a sense of wonder and instead oozes this sense of commercialism
- lack of continuity in that Anthony Stewart Head has replaced Pierce Brosnan as Chiron and Stanley Tucci has replaced Luke Camilleri as the hedonistic Dionysus
- the running gag of Dionysus' futile attempts to down the wine before it turns to water got old really fast
- uber-lame climax
- ""Thor Freudenthal"" should've been the name of a berserker character in the film; instead, it's the name of the director

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Back to Camp Half-Blood - cast speaks about reuniting for the sequel (00:02:40 minutes)
- It's All in the Eye - creating Tyson, Percy's cyclops half-brother (00:05:00 minutes)
- 2 theatrical trailers",1396483200,,4153,4.818820224719101

Even the main characters mother didn't even show up. I was disappointed with this movie but at least I was able to finish it. In my opinion this movie was a poor attempt to make a sequel and it focused on action not the development of the charterers like the first.

5800106,2,B00DHB419U,"I liked the first Percy Jackson movie.  It was inventive in the way it used the mythological source material, and I enjoyed it without feeling like I was far outside its target demographic.  I can't imagine anyone past their teens really liking the sequel, and even then, I doubt it will ever be anybody's favorite.

A big problem here is that the franchise's best ideas all seem to be tied up with explaining how the whole demigod thing works, and they already did that in the last movie.  It should be that once the origin story is out of the way, you can focus on exciting adventures, but even the quest plot in this one seems way less interesting than the first movie's.  The protagonists have to find the golden fleece, and they already know pretty much where it is, so they go there and find it.  They have to fight a few people and monsters along the way, but none of it feels very dangerous.  When a problem comes up that can't be solved with punching, the movie just gives Percy a new magic power or a convenient item to deal with it.  Even the villain seems bored with the proceedings.  It's the same guy as the last movie, and the closest we get to an explanation of his plot or motivation is basically, I'm gonna try to blow up Olympus again, for... whatever reason I said last time.

The major novel element in this movie is a new character, whose personality throughout boils down to very enthusiastic and also dumb.  Not, like, comically so  just higher-than-average enthusiasm and lower-than-average intelligence.  I began to feel sorry for the actor playing him, because most of the stuff they gave him to do is like watching someone's vacation videos: I'm really glad I'm on this trip with you guys.  This is fun!  Whoops, I dropped that thing I was supposed to hold onto!

On the whole, this movie felt like it was trying too hard to appeal to angsty teenagers without offending their parents.  Percy whinges constantly about being worried that he's not good enough, and the big epiphany at the end is some claptrap about making your own destiny (which barely even makes sense, because Percy just did one out of the two options he was prophesied to fulfill).  The villains are teasingly sympathetic because they've concluded that parents and teachers don't have all the answers, but the right path turns out to be for the heroes to do what they've been told and trust in the value of teamwork.  If you're 11, this all may work just fine for you.  If you're an adult, you've seen it many times before, often with greater nuance or just a better story to back it up.",1395446400,5,2583,4.525862068965517

5800144,4,B00DHB419U,I thought the first Percy Jackson kept you more on the edge of your seat and kept moving faster. But again the characters kept true to the first movie. I was looking for more special effects and action though.,1394236800,,209,4.384615384615385

5800151,5,B00DHB419U,I love all of the books and the movies. Even the Heroes of Olympus books are better than these. The Heroes of Olympus books if you don't know continue the story of the prophecy with different characters and they are really good books. I just don't get how they will be able to make all of the movies in the Percy Jackson series. The Percy Jackson actor is getting older and stuff and he's just the right actor I think for these movies. They might be able to make the 3rd movie but not the other ones. They'll have to bring in a new actor or quit making the movies. They should have started making these movies when the actor was the same age as in the books. They started making them when he was like 15 or 16 which is like the age he is in the Heroes of Olympus books.,1394064000,2,769,4.065789473684211

I decided that my daughter who at the time would not pick up a book if her life depended on it, that the three of them would benefit from me reading out loud to them. I started with the first in the series and trust me they were not happy, but about half way into the book they were hooked. Not only did I read to them whole traveling to games but they also put down the game controller, yes I said they put down the game controllers and came and got in my bed with me and I spent an hour or two reading to them. My husband does not read that often but he heard little snip its of what I was reading them and when we were done with the first book he asked for it and read it. that was our pattern until we caught up with Rick. Right now two of my kids have checked out his new series from the library. My husband put Percy right up there with Harry Potter. Now we wait for each of the movies to come out.

These seem to be a very good book series and so far the movies are doing a really good job of holding up their end of the bargain and staying interesting and full of action.

any way not impressed at all.  I think these directors and producers are way to into their dope and have no clue as to how to produce a decent movie and more.

5800196,1,B00DHB419U,"I refused to watch the Lighting Thief when it came out in theaters because I knew they had changed so much stuff from the book.  It was the same with Sea of Monsters.  However, my father, who has never read the books, wanted to see both of them and so I ended up renting them for him to watch.  I get the fact that due to time constraints, things may need to be cut or slightly altered when making a book into a movie.  But, and this is a really big but, you don't rewrite 3000 years of Greek mythology just because you don't feel like properly following the plot of the book that you are making into a movie.  And that is just the beginning of the atrocities.

When the author of the highly popular, best selling, series offers to assist you on the script for the movie based on his book (as Riordan did with the Lighting Thief, he learned his lesson and did not offer again), you don't blow him off thinking that you know better.  These books have a built in fan base and altering the stories so much so you can sex things up (ahem, yes, I'm talking about Percy and Annabeth) and Hollywoodize the crap out of them to try and turn a profit, things are going to back fire.  Fans aren't stupid.  They know when things have been changed for the sake of earning a buck and it's a pretty poor buck you're trying to get them to spend.

If you haven't read the books, maybe you'll be fooled into liking this.  Even my father thought this one was a bit too over the top so I doubt I'll have to succumb to renting the next one (if this even did well enough overseas to warrant a third one) and I can save myself the torture of watching Hollywood rip apart one of my favorite series.

All I can say is the cursed blade isn't Percy's sword as Hollywood would have you believe.  The cused blade is the freaking pen that was used to sign off on this pile of crap.  *Climbs down off soap box in a huff*",1393200000,4,1889,4.1256830601092895

Jackson,Alexandra Daddario,  Douglas Smith, Leven Rambin, Jake Abel, Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion. I was very pleased to see the entire production,after the first one,on a much better footing as it ended up being far better.
The story finds us pretty much starting where the last one left off. If you recall, three out of four 1/2 Gods made it into the training camp alive. The one who died saving the rest was the daughter of Zeus,Thalia. What we didn't see is Thalia morphing into a living tree which in turn produced a barrier around the camp which no ordinary  enemy could penetrate. One day a young cyclops arrives to join the camp,and it turns out to be Percy's half brother(a cyclops)Tyson. Percy's girlfriend isn't too thrilled as her close friend Thalia died by a cyclops' hand.
A huge brass,mechanical bull arrives to wreak havoc in the camp,penetrating the supposedly impenetrable barrier. After taking it down Luke,Hermes half son,arrives. Luke has poisoned the tree,which explains the bulls arrival. Luke tries to persuade Percy to come to his side,and mentions a quest,before he is rebuked and disappears. Percy afterwards confronts the camp leader about the quest,who sends him to the office attic. There Percy learns that it will be he that leads a group on a special quest. Back outside the camp learns the only thing that will save Thalia is the Golden Fleece. It resides on an island in the Sea of Monsters,located in the Bermuda Triangle,ruled over by the cyclops that killed Thalia,Polyphemus.
To get them to Florida fast,Percy's girlfriend hails the Chariot of Damnation,piloted by the three Stygian Witches. When they profess to having not enough Drachmas to pay the ever increasing cab fare,the witches drop them off in Washington,DC. While there they look up Hermes,who is running a delivery  service,OPS(Olympus Parcel Service).He gives them a couple of items that later come in handy to them on their journey. He also asks Percy to ask his son Luke to not be so angry with the world.
Leaving here they make their way to the ocean and hail a Hippocampus,a brightly coloured animal who is a cross between a sea horse and a luck dragon. The creature takes them to the yacht Luke and his posse are using to get to the island. The all get briefly captured, but thanks to  the tools Hermes gave Percy,they escape. However,the group get captured in Charybdis's whirlpool(in mythology sometimes just a whirlpool,but here a living creature)along the way,and end up in its huge stomach. While there, the group come upon the daughter of Ares,Clarisse,who was also was trying to get to the fleece,but now leads a motley crew of zombies,piloting a Vietnam era gun ship. They hop aboard and with Percy's help ,manage to free themselves from the monsters stomach. They sail away and find the island with the fleece. They enter caves there and find the fleece,guarded by the cyclops Polyphemus. They manage to wrestle the fleece away and trap the cyclops at the same time. Above ground Luke arrives and fires an arrow at Percy,which is taken by Tyson,who falls away into the water far below. While the despondent group assesses their loss,Luke uses the fleece to revive the bones of Kronos,the father of Poseidan,Ares and Zeus. Luke hopes to control Kronos,but Luke,it turns out,is the first to be eaten by Kronos. The group now must not only deal with Luke's men,but Kronos also. It is a pitched battle but in the end Percy and his friends prevail. Tyson even has come back from the""dead"",having been healed by the waters below. The only glitch is Percy's girlfriend,who was struck down and had to be brought back by the power of the fleece.
Back at the camp they cover some of the roots of Thalia's tree with the fleece. Next day the camp is astonished to see that the fleece has not only cured the tree,but brought Thalia herself back from the dead. The film ends as we see Kronos's remains glowing inside the sarcophagus they came in.
This film moves along extremely well and its special effects work for the film brilliantly. There are some wonderful moments,but two humourous ones stand out. First is the cab ride with the Stygian Witches. It's a New York yellow cab,and when it first arrives I thought Buster Poindexter from ""Scrooged"" was going to stick his face out of the window. Between the three of them,they argue and nit pick while driving with alarming speed on their journey, scaring the bejeesus out of their passengers;all the while either looking with one eye or no eye. The second instance is Nathan Fillion's portrayal as Hermes. His time on screen isn't terribly long but it is very memorable. One of the items he gives the group to assist them in their quest he says is from a favourite show of his that was""cancelled"".An obvious in-joke referring to his own classic ""Firefly"".This film is obviously geared towards a teen demographic,but I found this time around,compared to the first,it doesn't shut out the older crowd as much. It can be enjoyed on many levels by a larger demo.
Technically speaking the movie is in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras on this disc. Another example of the indiscriminate ""push"" to buy Blu Ray over  plain DVD.Reminding one of the change over from VHS to DVD.Do you feel like you have a ring in your nose,and you're being led around a ring by the entertainment industry?
All in all this latest installment in the Percy Jackson franchise(there WILL be more),is a winner from beginning to the end. The script is well written and the  acting is top notch. It is far and away a big improvement over the first one,and one can only hope the producers are able to keep up this momentum with the next one. Recommended.",1393113600,,5814,4.820641282565131
5800205,3,B00DHB419U,I am a fan of these books and the movies overall. The acting and directing could have a a little bit better. Overall a good watch.,1393113600,,130,4.038461538461538

I didn't care for the Lightning Thief and was hoping that this one was better--it wasn't:(  The special effects for the cyclops eye is laughable.  Overall, the movie was very disappointing.",1393113600,,310,4.685185185185185

5800210,5,B00DHB419U,"this is a great addition to the Percy Jackson series; while not an Oscar contender it is good clean comfortable watching for the whole family.  It is hard to find movies that appeal to all ages in the family, it needs to have action, good dialogue, and needs to not have to many, if any, squeamish moments (ie sex scenes, excessive gore). I will have to admit that absolutely any, any movie that has Nathan Fillion; goes into our family movie collection.",1393027200,,454,4.536585365853658

5800212,3,B00DHB419U,"Sea of Monsters just didn't deliver-they should have followed the book. It seems like its going to be a perpetual contest between Percy an this one guy-shows a lack of imagination The plot was full of holes with things going on all over the place. I reached the point I just wanted the movie over with. They just needed a better screen play and creative director.
I hope they get things right in Pt. 3.",1393027200,4,402,4.373333333333333
5800213,4,B00DHB419U,This movie was not as good as the first installment but never the less I still liked it for the fantasy and action. Its a good enough movie that I would watch it again.,1392940800,,168,3.9705882352941178
5800214,1,B00DHB419U,"Washed up, hokey, and downright cheap. The books were not done justice in this viewer's opinion. I was truly hoping for the next Harry Potter. What audiences were given was a hastily thrown together cocktail of low-budget cinema. I may be wrong about the budget, but if I'm not... You might want to fire your director or check to see if he embezzled funds. The level of acting is immature and the flow of the movie feels stinted. If you enjoy this movie then you should give A Clockwork Orange a shot as well.",1392854400,3,509,4.425531914893617

5800229,1,B00DHB419U,Nothing like the book. Characters were caricatures. Completely different vibe than the first movie. How sad they ruined the series with this poor attempt.,1392681600,,154,5.458333333333333

5800234,4,B00DHB419U,Fun to watch. This series isn't as guilt ridden or weirdly pretentious as some other juvenile series (I'm looking at you Mr Potter). Not particularly deep but with a basic understanding of Greek lore it is a fun ride.,1392595200,,217,4.589743589743589
5800235,5,B00DHB419U,This is such an awesome and really great movie! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a watch.,1392595200,,98,3.95
5800236,5,B00DHB419U,"This movie was very action packed and followed the book pretty well.  Special effects were great and we decided it was ok for the kids as well (our kids are 7 and older).  Some parts can be pretty scary for the kids, but there is enough comic relief in the scary parts that it wasn't too bad.  Some younger kids would probably not like it though.",1392595200,,346,4.212121212121212
5800237,1,B00DHB419U,It's easy to see that this movie was just a money grab by the movie studio.  None of the adults from the first movie are back.  Their salaries are probably too high.  The CGI is terrible in the one.  It's pretty clear that the studio made this movie as cheap as possible in an attempt to make a small profit from fans of the first movie.,1392595200,,337,4.0606060606060606

5800240,1,B00DHB419U,"This is like Eragon all over again. How can they make such a horrible movie from such a great book?! Maybe it's just me, but this movie is exactly how I didn't imagine the world of Percy Jackson.",1392508800,5,195,4.157894736842105
5800241,2,B00DHB419U,"What a horrible letdown. The acting was wooden, the interpretation of the story was horrible, and things were changed that had no reason to be changed. All in all, the movie reminded me of a mediocre fanfiction retelling of the book.

So why two stars instead of one? Because there were moments that captured the essence of the story, and they were great. But don't bother wading through an hour and a half or more of meh for the few moments sprinkled here and there.",1392508800,,467,4.4941176470588236

Helping, saving their dying safe location for all 1/2 gods, you will follow this tale with the son of Poseidon and his friends as they embark on a quest.

5800255,4,B00DHB419U,Remembering a little something about Mythology helps to understand this movie even better. Even if you know nothing of Mythology it can still be entertaining.

So I got this with birthday money as a little treat for myself but... I put the disk in, it played the dumb trailers perfectly and got to the menu. I was so stoked to be able to finally watch this (because I never get to go to the movies..) but after I hit play it just took me to the DVD player's home screen. I was so confused and tried it again. It's not the player either because it played my other movies just fine afterwards.

Maybe it is a result of having read the books and obsessed over them since they first came out, but if that is the case with you, I advise against seeing this movie. I enjoyed the first ten minutes, then spent the rest of it making comparisons.

In an attempt to be fair, I think this movie is one you either love or hate.
On the bright side, it fixed up several things from the first movie... And then proceeded to get nearly everything else categorically wrong.

So, good and bad.
I LOVED how they did Clarisse, Hermes and Chiron. Clarisse was the tough, take-no-prisoners perfect Daughter of Ares, Nathen wasn't quite how I envisioned Hermes physically, but pulled the character off Perfectly. Same with Stanley as Dionysus. Anthony Stewart Head is the wise old centaur I had envisioned ever since I read the first book.
I imagined Luke as being taller and more muscular, but otherwise Jake was the best I can think of for the role, and played the angry, angst-y, collage-age villain to perfection.
The Oracle was pretty good, and I would have enjoyed the stain-glass-storytelling if they hadn't managed to completely screw up the myth.

Unfortunately, that's about it.

The main trio are, at this point, supposed to be 13 - 14 years old, but are all played by adult actors. They fixed the fact that all children of Athena are blonde and grey-eyed, but removed any trace of Annabeth's personality to compensate for it.
Selina was a spy who communicated with Luke via a magic charm, and Ethan didn't even meet Luke until the fourth book! WHAT THE #%*?} ARE THEY DOING WITH LUKE NOW? And why is a character described as African-American being played by an Asian-looking actor?
Why are the Demigods carting around iPads and cell-phones, when it is clearly stated that electronics are like sending up a flare for monsters to show up and try to eat you? What is with all the pop-culture and product-placement jokes? For the record, Demigods use Nectar as a medicine that can turn you to ashes if you ingest too much, not as a casual drink.
Why is Tyson the dumb comic relief who makes it sound like Poseidon held his hand the entire way to camp, rather than the child-like but loyal and occasionally wise cyclops who shares a deep friendship and protective brotherly bond with Percy, despite being the first real conflict between Percy and Annabeth?
Where is Circe, and the Sirens? The bonding moments between Percy and Annabeth as she starts really opening up to him? Hands up anyone who thinks that Polyphemus would live in an abandoned theme park, or that a powerful sorceress like Circe would allow him within ten leagues of her home?

Honestly, I wonder if the director didn't just google the Wikipedia summary of the series, and make things up from there.

And no, finding an actor with a strong physical likeness to the author, calling him ""Reardon"" and turning him into a zombie was not a funny joke. Those of us who even caught it in the first place were cringing in our seats.",1391817600,31,3031,4.62453531598513

I had enjoyed the first film altho it was no masterpiece, I've watched it a few times. but the cover of this one was so beautiful, gilded hologram that even though I had passed it up in the theaters, I was intrigued. I did a quick Google check and read that the film was decided to be developed with 3D projection in mind after the 3rd week of planning. The same conversion company was used that converted Titanic. That was enough to persuade me to buy and MAN am I glad I did. Definitely some of the best 3D conversion to date, along the lines of Avengers. Just stunning. I can see how others seeing this in 2D might think it was just okay, but on my plasma 3D screen, it is freaking heaven. The ending scenes with the Ark and Kronos ... wow.

The character seemed annoyed with having to do anything, and the actor's delivery almost seemed like he was just trying to get through his lines without yawning. The first film really allowed all 3 of the main characters to be independent and shine in their own respective talents. This time round it seemed like the director was making Percy the Brain that told his limbs (his companions) what to do. Without him directing they just seemed to stand there and wait. Not the actors' fault, but there was some good talent being wasted. It was still entertaining, just as the first one was, but if they decide to do a third, they need to have Percy's character get over his whining of ""why me?"" attitude, and bring back the sense of fellowship and dependence on each other that made the first movie enjoyable.  Oh, and the fake skeleton as the ""oracle"" in the attic, just about had me stopping the movie and asking for a refund.

The highlights are the special effects which I think are very good. This movie I think is meant more for the teenage type audience I think though and I found it less entertaining than other fantasy style action movies.

Monsters had the same issue as Thief where the main character is incompetent, as in having to be told remember now you can use your super powers, and while that may have gotten slightly better Monsters added other characters being overly annoying trying to show they are selfish that is overdone. There are obvious influences of other movies. If I had not seen so many trailers showing main scenes (as is the case with many movie trailers these days) it would have been better.

Logan Lerman is first rate in the part of Percy. His support cast are all a great bunch of young actors and the appearance of Nathan Filion is wonderful. The chemistry between all these exceptional young actors is great but I have to say the chemistry between Percy and his Cyclops brother is heart warming.

I still think it's worth watching though especially if you loved the 1st one which I def. did...even if just watching for the cool effects and the story (if unfamiliar) alone.  I also think the 2nd story they chose to make into a movie was just a much harder-to-make-into-a-movie vs. the Lightning Thief...
One thing I would definitely recommend regardless, read the book series (& yes, I mean regardless of age esp. if you like the genre).  I was in my 30s and read the Harry Potter series and I loved it.  Maybe I'm just strange though?

5800374,1,B00DHB419U,"Why is it, in the 21st century, we are still teaching boys and girls these unhealthy lessons about themselves?  Apparently the author of the books from which the films are adapted wrote the characters as 2-dimensional stereotypes worthy of cartoons for children, if that.  Same old messages that have been around forever.  Why is the ""good"" girl shown as weak, physically and emotionally, needing to be rescued by a boy over and over again.  She falls down and cries out to Percy for help, so he turns around and helps her up.  She wasn't injured, so why couldn't she just stand up, for heaven's sake?!  She acts as his emotional rescuer by constantly acting as his personal cheerleader.  Is this how we want our young girls to grow up: to believe they have to take care of some man's emotions and otherwise be dependent upon him for meeting their physical needs?  And the ""bad"" girl is shown as less likable because she demonstrates characteristics that would be totally acceptable in a male: she's confident, capable, and success oriented.  But instead of being shown as a strong young woman, she's masculinized, displaying the unlikable traits of a man: a swaggering, conceited jock.  When is Hollywood going to adapt anything for young adults that portrays them as multi-layered, complex individuals?  The only reason I gave this film one star is because of the special effects, which were very good and frankly the only bright moments in the film.  PASS ON THIS ONE.

I thought a reasonably bad start would get their act together and make them turn out a decent movie, so I went ahead and bought it. I probably should have looked at some reviews first.

Only at the barest minimum did it have anything in common with the books. Right out of the gate, the whole situation surrounding Percy's brother and their introduction had me groaning. The hits kept coming after that. Overall, I hated it for how much they butchered it.

But was it a good movie for those who know nothing about the books? Sure. I watched it with my parents and younger brother. They seemed to like it. It's reasonably flashy with good action and acting. It stands on its own two feet with strangers to the series just fine.

That said, it was still a visually pleasing movie, and I thought the Cyclops in particular was really cool, but yeah, outside of that, pretty underwhelming. I'd still recommend watching this, especially if you have a tween in your home, since the movie is definitely more geared towards a YA audience, but for me, it was just meh.",1390089600,,664,4.533333333333333

5800445,4,B00DHB419U,"Directed by Thor Freudenthal, Produced by Michael Barnathan/Karen Rosenfelt, Starring Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson), Brandon Jackson (Grover), Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth), Douglas Smith (Tyson) and Jake Abel (Luke). Music by Andrew Lockington, Cinematography by Shelly Johnson.

Storyline: Camp Half-Blood is a little township where the children of Gods live in peace and harmony. This is where Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon-Greek God of the Sea) and his friends Annabeth, Grover, Luke and Tyson (Percys half brother) live. Long ago, a girl called Thalia, daughter of the eldest God, Zeus, sacrifices her life to protect Annabeth, Luke and Grover against a monster attack. Her death leaves her to be transformed into a pine tree and form a protection layer to the Camp. One day Luke, the great grandson of the evil Titan God Kronos, tries to revive him from his coffin through the Golden Fleece, and seeks Percys help, since he believes that Percy is the only living child of the eldest Gods, as per a legend of the Oracle. Percy turns down Lukes proposal. Luke in protest, poisons Thalias tree and disappears. The Camp elders now know that the tree can be saved only through the Golden Fleece, which has magical powers to heal and raise the dead. Percy and his friends set out to obtain the Fleece from Polyphemus Lair in an island in the middle of the Sea of Monsters. Percy adventures to get the Fleece from the monster man and while returning is confronted by Luke. The Golden Fleece is used to raise the Kronos from his coffin, by Luke. But Percy valiantly kills the Kronos with his Riptide, a cursed blade gifted by his father. Percy and his team bring back the Golden Fleece to the Camp Half-Blood and revive the dying Thalia tree and restores the protection layer. In the process, Thalia also comes back to life due to the magical power of the Golden Fleece only to reveal her true identity and surprise everyone.

Positives: An visual treat for all age groups. Though the story line is a little confusing for those who haven't seen the first part in Percy Jackson series, one gets to enjoy the extensive graphics used and great screenplay assisted by beautiful cinematography. The visual effects are so rich and colourful that the audience is virtually carried into a different world, when watched on big screen.

Negatives: The story line is confusing for those who haven't watched the previous Percy Jackson movie The Lightning Thief.

5800466,1,B00DHB419U,This movie was the most shallow one I have  watched in a long time. I think that the characters were  very undeveloped and the  whole film seems  rushed.

Since viewing the second movie in the Percy Jackson series, however, it's impossible to imagine that he had any input into the two movie scripts.

5800505,5,B00DHB419U,I have been using meaningful beauty for 3 months now. I LOVE IT!!!! I saw changes in my skin after the first 2 weeks. I'm not one that has bad skin from the start ad I don't have break outs. But I do have oily skin and I've been over washing with all types of products in the past. This product has changed the way my skin produces oils and I'm even smoother than I was before. I have very sensitive skin and some products have given me rashes on my neck and cheeks but not meaningful beauty. I'm only 31 and I'm hoping to stay looking 31 as long as possible. Everyone's skin is different so all I can say is don't go off of everyone else's bad experiences do try for yourself. If you don't like it then don't buy it again. I used to spend $500 on Chanel face product but never again. I have become a definite believer and meaningful beauty is for me! BEST PRODUCT EVER IN MY OPINION.,1389484800,,884,4.086206896551724

5800517,3,B00DHB419U,"I have the unique perspective of having NEVER read any of the books. With that disclaimer well-in-place, I shall resist the urge to digress further. PJ: SoM is an enjoyable romp, in its own right (and aside from the previous iteration); but, there is going to be a serious  disconnect if you haven't read/viewed the Lightning Thief first. Some of its predictable - atonement for previous sin, reconciliation with the half-brother he never knew he had, but of particular twisted interest is Dionysus - clearly in torment (usually from his previously offending Zeus) during the film adds to the few moments of comic relief.

5800599,4,B00DHB419U,"Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of Hunger Games because it is essentially a young adolescent's fantasy story. In many ways I prefer Percy Jackson because it is less pretentious and has a lot more action. Do make sure you catch the first Percy Jackson film before seeing this one! I haven't read the books, but I presume we are seeing Percy growing towards becoming a true hero and leader; so this is a story of personal development. As such I applaud the good intentions but it was just slightly over-played. In the end I found Percy just a bit too self-effacing for his own good. The plot line is okay, the special effects excellent, and the acting all it was required to be. A good film leaves you thinking and emotionally involved in the characters. Unfortunately I wasn't. So although it is pleasant eye candy with almost non-stop action, I can't say this is a memorable film.",1389139200,3,881,4.582278481012659

The storyline is decent, and there are a couple of interesting characters, particularly the special effects used to transform one of the young actors into a cyclops.

Without putting in too many spoilers, Annabeth was a very competitive character in the first one.  She had been reduced to lost little puppy status for this one and that was very disappointing.  Though Stanley Tucci reprised his role, Pierce Brosnan had made an exit, along with the other big names.

5800641,1,B00DHB419U,"To put this into perspective, I'm a 39 year old that has read the entire series and loved them. I even mildly like the first movie The Lightning Thief. I never expect the movies to match the book but I haven't seen such a repugnant screen adaptation since Clan of the Cavebear.  The sea of monsters has One monster. For some bizarre reason the cyclops lives in a roller coaster, and the cruise ship that was full of evil badness is now a yacht with one monster and 4 bad guys.  The entire story in the book was thrashed. The only thing they kept were the character names.

There were a few things I liked.
 Nathan Fillion as Hermes.
Rainbow the hippocampus.
and the taxi ride.

Paid for this on blueray so I got gyped.

5800648,4,B00DHB419U,"First off let me say that I liked this movie. Now for the review, You would think that a movie with the title of ""Sea of Monsters"" would have a lot of action sequences in the sea with monsters, well there is not but one action scene with a sea monster and it is not the best scene in the movie by far, There are several action scenes with monsters and they are cool scenes, I won't go into detail so I don't spoil the movie for anyone reading this. I gave this movie 4 of 5 stars because there are some scenes where Percy is ""I'm not good enough"" and at camp half blood Percy is regulated to a janitor instead of being heralded as the only living child of one of the big 3 as they put it and even go as far ass the head of camp half blood not even knowing his name or that Percy was the one who saved Olympus and mankind,

5800668,4,B00DHB419U,"First of all the should hire me to help write the 3rd movie adaption from the book!

What was lacking in sea of monsters from the lightning theif? Character development! They spend a long time developing the relationship between Percy and his new half brother cyclops and totally forgot about everyone else! In the first movie Annabeth was his rival just as Clarisse is in this movie, but what about Percy and Annabeth? He was hot to trot for her in the first movie, and now they seem to be boyfriend and girlfriend and not a single kiss? He hugs her like 4-5 times and she turns her cheek and hugs him! Wtf? His mother is nowhere to be found all the gods are nowhere to be found except Hermes, but who cares about him. In the beginning of this movie Thalia saves young Annabeth, Grover and Luke, but when she awakens doesn't recognize anyone. And Annabeth is right there, wouldn't she hug her fallen now risen friend instantly? Where's the feelings and the relationships? Now don't scrap this movie it's a great series! But in the next few movies instead of rushing though the stories develop the characters! Which is probably the difference between epics like Harry potter and lotr and why those movies work so well at 3hrs runtime vs Percy's not quite 2hrs!",1388793600,,1260,4.575221238938053
5800669,4,B00DHB419U,This story was pretty good. The characters are more fleshed out. The prophecy piece was left a little unresolved. There were some storylines that didn't really make sense but there was a requirement for a quest that could have been resolved by Grover pretty easily.

Well.....if you can't find anything else then this is one of those movies that was ok to see one time but not more than that.  It's ok at best and I'd only see it if there's nothing else to see.  Remember how the first Percy Jackson movie was?  This isn't that good - so that's saying quite a bit since that wasn't exactly the best movie of that season either.  I'd say only see it if you don't have anything else to see.  Other than that it was pretty mediocre.,1388707200,,561,4.054545454545455

  This movie messed up Anabeth so much. Why is it whenever she on the ground she needs Percy to help her up. In the books most of the time . Anabeth was saving Percy when did it switch sides like that. Why is it so changed that Percy is doughting himself, I don't get the whole Kronos thing. Like why was it that he came to life then went back into his scarphoics, soon he gonna rise again. I don't really get that.  The movie had lots of comedy I loved it. I liked the way how it was simuliar to  the book but not completely like the book. I would hate that if I read the book, then go see the movie. Sit there for 1hr 22 min and know whats going to happen and every line. The twist were good the movie was good. Just Annabeth she way cooler then this.

5800704,1,B00DHB419U,"Let me get this straight, I am not giving this one star because a copy from this person came scratched or anything like that. I am simply saying that this movie has no right to put Percy Jackson's name on the front of it and add sea of monsters at the end. If you haven't read the books, you might think it is a good movie, but first of all, it will mislead you as to the characters and story line of pure gold that is the book, and second of all it will get you completely wrong on the 3 THOUSAND YEAR OLD STORIES that are collectively Greek Mythology. If you are not the kind of person who likes to read books, fine. Just do me a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. There are so many other family friendly action and adventure movies out there and if you are going to show this to your kids they will come away from it with an incorrect understanding of Greek Mythology. ""So what,"" you say, ""where will they need knowledge of that anymore?"" Well, for starters, in school. This may come as a surprise to you, but schools now days teach Greek mythology as part of history curriculum, at least they do at mine and it really helped to have a basic understanding of these stories coming into it. That is one of the wonderful things about the book. Rick Riordan really sticks to mythology and makes it entertaining to a young audience. In this regard,a reader learns about Greek Mythology as they read. on the other hand, the movie gets it wrong. Poseidon did not kill Kronos, and certainly not with a sword. Zeus killed Kronos by cutting him into thousands of pieces with his own scythe. That is maybe one of the most important stories in Greek Mythology and this movie got it wrong. OK, so you don't care about that. Well, the characters are cardboard. In the books, the characters are actually funny, witty, wonderful young people. They aren't reckless and they battle with things like their place in society and who they are. They know that the fate of the world is resting on their shoulders and they won't let it down. How is Annabeth, who in the books is strong, independent, and smart, thinks Percy is a 'Seaweedbrain' and does not forget to tell him so, shallow and needy? She never would ask Percy what to do because he would be asking her. She saves Percy ten times for every one time he saves her and they are a seamless team. In the movie, they are simply a shallow two people you know will fall for each other in the end, and the fact that they aren't yet simply makes it more painful to watch. in simple terms: the books are amazing. I hate the movies. everytime you watch this movie without reading the books fist, it crushes the soul of every fan in the entire fandom. if that cant stop you from foolishly wasting your money, I do not know what will.",1388620800,9,2762,4.323699421965318

5800732,2,B00DHB419U,"I hate to disagree with all the others here but I thought this was a poorly done sequel to the first movie which wasn't all that great either.  I am a great fan of the Percy Jackson series due to the exciting and often amusing writing and also due to the mythological aspects of the stories.  I also like Logan Lerman a lot (who is really much too old for Percy).
I was prepared to go see 'Sea of Monsters' several times, but after the first 45 minutes, I was sorry to sit through the rest of it.  The movie storyline departed from the book significantly in favor of a slam-bang ending that made no sense.  Moreover, Percy is supposed to be a HERO.  Here he was a wimp moaning about his failures - give me a break!  In addition, Logan Lerman seemed to phone his acting in - and based on his interviews which showed that he spent little time working on this film, that's exactly what he did.
Lastly the production values weren't particularly good.  If they would spend even half the amount they've spent on the Potter or Hunger Games films, they might have had a hit on their hands.

Fine, we're being sensitive to ""special"" needs children, by changing the movie in such a fashion you robbed a crucial lesson Percy learned and that I exploited to no end with my children about it. How truly special these children can be and that they just as much heart and soul as they rest of us.
Anyway-
The rest of the movie: atrocious performance by the cast, it was bland and just thrown together. The look and feel of the movie seemed to have taken on aspects from HUNGER GAMES (that was terrible) which destroyed the crisp fresh and hip originality of the first movie. It was painful to watch, I felt like Polyphemus, I wanted to eat those demigods and the director.

Granted, there were still quite a few liberties taken, but that's Hollywood for you. I think they are heading in a better direction than the first movie. The writing could still use a little bit of work, though. Most of it wasn't terrible, but there were some extremely corny lines that just didn't work...not because of the actors either.

I mean I was expecting it to follow the story a lot better. It did spark my interest in the books though  so I decided to give the sequel a try. Boy was I glad I did! It was a great film. After getting over there fact that this wasn't going to be an exact match up with  the books, the movie was enjoyable. Bringing in Dionysus, the cab ride scene, and the great effects used to create the bronze bull and the hippocampuses (hippocampi?, whatever) were great! Atlthough there were scenes I wished they could have added (I really wanted to Percy as a guinea pig on Circe's island) and the whole ""Kronos rising early, Percy's sword  being the cursed blade"" thing made me wanna pull out my hair, every other part exceeded my expectations. Okay, so it might not be the film  for those who want their favorite series copied and pasted onto the big screen. It's still a great film with awesome characters.",1388188800,,1053,4.276381909547739

What a laugh that would be!
The hubby liked it more than I did though. He watched the whole thing where I couldn't. Here's what he had to say about it;
 'The movie was exciting but more geared to teens.'
So there ya have it. It's a good movie for people 12-19. My son is gonna be bummed we watched it without him. At least he can watch it anytime, which I'm sure he will repeatedly.",1388188800,,671,4.083333333333333

We were a little less disappointed in the second movie which did at least try to stay a bit closer to the story but still didn't really follow it.  Personally I wish that they had stayed closer to the books like they did with Harry Potter.  Mainly they should have started with younger actors (Percy was only supposed to be about 11 or 12 not 16) and followed what the author wrote instead of just adding things in however they felt.  The books are entertaining enough to be a movie without being changed.

We just watched this DVD and he liked it but he was also disappointed. The storyline of the film did not follow the story in the book and we all wondered why. It seems that directors think they have to remake a great story to get in all of their Computer Graphics to jazz up the action of a film. That may be great on a fresh storyline but on a movie that is made from a popular book all of the fans get disappointed that the plot lines and action has changed.

We rated the film as a 4 Star item but we wish it have been truer to the book. The CGI and special effects were very good and there is a lot of action to entertain you. It is a good family movie to sit around and eat some popcorn and enjoy but it may be too intense for little ones. It is rated PG.

I was looking forward to this film, and while maybe they kept to the book's plotline (erm, and had to deal with all the important things they left out of the first book), where it fell flat for me was the humor. There wasn't ANY! I know Percy's feeling bad about his dad sort of ignoring him and all, but heartfelt things generally work better when balanced with a bit of humor. There wasn't ANY. There also wasn't any tension with Annabeth (another possibly source of humor they missed, as well as romantic tension). And when it came time for the Themes of the film, they all felt very heavy-handed as a result.

Hopefully these movies will keep coming.",1387756800,2,348,4.208955223880597
5800871,4,B00DHB419U,"My son, 10, was a huge fan of the Lightning Thief and since then they have started reading the books in class.  The result, as you may expect, is that he's devouring Percy Jackson content like crazy.  My daughter, almost 3, has a crush on Percy Jackson as well so for better or worse I'm usually stuck watching one of these movies at least a few times a week.  We cut the cord with cable/satellite so it's streaming movies only for our household, but that's another story.

Back to the film.  While the first movie was good the second has improved on that formula and put out a sequel that is even more entertaining.  The biggest strike against this film is the re-casting of Pierce Bronson's character.  No idea why that happened (availability, cost, creative differences), but all things being equal, a single character re-cast as a gripe isn't that bad I suppose.  Lots of action in this sequel and the special effects are very good.

I've not read the books, but it seems that anyone who is a huge fan of any written series may well be disappointed by a film adaptation.  It's just not possible to incorporate EVERY aspect of the book into a movie.  If you divorce the two, and view them as separate entities you are better off.  My understanding is that this movie is much truer to the book, but my son hasn't complained about either, but if you are a purist you will probably enjoy this more than the first.

It's a good teenage romp following a group of demi-gods on their quest to find the golden fleece and stop the impending resurrection of the original titan, Kronos.  If you enjoy greek mythology, action/adventure, and have children this is hard to go wrong on.",1387756800,,1674,4.536666666666667

I would like to have seen a little more special effects but it still told a good story.  I didn't care much for the cyclops effect for Tyson.  If his eye is in the middle then maybe they should have had sunglasses that were a little larger in the middle and the glasses would not have sat on his nose as well as they did because when he had one eye the bridge of his nose was a lot lower than when the glasses were on.  So the point is enjoy the story line and over look the sunglasses.,1387670400,,663,3.917910447761194

Much better than the first movie and I'm glad they introduced the Kronos plot, but in the future, they need to follow the actual books rather than straying so far from them.

Thor Freudenthal did a much better job directing this one than Columbus did on the first and it shows. He had a crap movie to follow and did the best he could.

They need to develop more of the plot lines more and not make it one action scene after another. There needs to be more character development. Other than that, it was a decent movie; not the best I've seen but far from the worst",1387584000,,750,4.267605633802817

This second movie in the series just seemed to flounder a bit as it tried to find the same kind of spark that the first movie had. The plot, while interesting enough, never truly found its legs and seemed to fizzle out towards the end. The acting was fairly well done as well, but some actors were horribly stilted to the point of being cringe-worthy. Lastly, it veered quite a ways away from the book, so if you are a fan of the book you might not like the broad and sweeping changes the screenwriters have made to the book original timeline/events.",1387584000,,678,4.388888888888889
5800908,2,B00DHB419U,"I love the Percy Jackson series.  I have read every one, plus several others by the same author.  ""Percy Jackson"" had the chance to be close to a Harry Potter series, moviewise.  For those who read the books, they have a great broad theme (the saving of the West as personified by Ancient Greek Ideals)  the idea of the noble hero, and the same theme as the Potter books in that true friendship can overcome impossible odds in saving that which is really important.  With creative writing and a love of Greek mythology Riordan created intricate, fascinating books.  So what did the film makers do?  Jettison every good concept, storyline and character to create a Disneyfied, shallow movie that kept none of these concepts.  I could get it if they had improved some things, but no, it's a train wreck.  How could they have destroyed the character of Tyson?  ""Hey, we'll change Tyson from a homeless slow of speech fine artisan who is taken in by Percy's Mom, to a cool, goodlooking guy who's really clumsy!  And what is all this, ""Make your own destiny!"" garbage?  Annabeth would NEVER say that.  They whole idea of ancient Greek stories is that everyone has a destiny they are bound to, like the ""Fates""! (Oops, they left out all that too!)

They lost all the charm of the books, in order to create just another action/kids movie.  They could have made an entire series of all five books, and they could have been epic, like the Harry Potter ones, with heart and inspiration.  But instead they hacked and slashed their way through an great story and destroyed it, leaving out what intrigued so many people.  It's more than leaving out this scene or that.  It's losing every interesting concept that made the books special and unique.  I was so disappointed after seeing this.  Didn't they learn anything with the Narnia movies?  When you have a book with a cult following,  don't rewrite it.  Because the book is wonderful as it is and the fans just get mad.  They won't come to see any sequel.  I won't.  I guess I just have to reread all the books I bought and keep my money away from butchery like this.",1387497600,2,2107,4.566844919786096

Every line of dialogue was badly delivered with the same wooden tone. I saw the first one and don't remember the bad acting being this noticable.

It was like all the actors had signed on to do more than the first movie and were being forced to do this one. The acting was SUPER bad even though I know they can all act very well in other projects. It felt like they were just filming this because they had to and not because they wanted to. It was depressing to watch them all lower themselves to this extent. Not to mention that I do not see ANY chemistry between Percy or Annabeth. I am not sure where it went but it was lacking in this movie. I am upset that I wasted my time and money on this.,1387411200,,626,3.8984375
5800917,5,B00DHB419U,"I loved the first Percy Jackson movie, and when I heard I was reviewing
the sequel I already knew what it would be an epic and thrilling
adventure with a perfect mix of suspense and comedy! And I was right.
""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is a fun and mythical adventure
everyone would love!

I still did not expect so many surprises in this movie and greatly
enjoyed it! The story continues as if it was a day or a week after the
first movie which was a good perk as well. Something else that's very
cool is the fact that movie is super close to the actual book! The
adventure begins when Percy (Logan Lerman) is still at camp with his
friends, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario).
Everything is more or less the same. There is a new girl whose name is
Clarisse. (Leven Rambin) She is the daughter of a human and the god of
war. This girl is beating the heck out of Percy and she's very mean as
well. One day there's a bionic monster outside of the camp, thanks to
one of the gods though, there is a shield reflecting the bionic
nightmare, when the shield is broken they destroy the machine and Percy
discovers that Luke, a villain that tried to over throw the gods, is
alive! Annabeth discovers that the tree producing the shield is dying
and appears to be poisoned. Annabeth, Percy, and not a very happy
Grover all go on a quest to receive an artifact that can bring anything
dying to life  Golden Flees! Do you believe they can restore the
shield and save their camp? You would have to watch the movie!

There is so much to love about this film and maybe only one or two
things to dislike. It has comedy, action, adventure, mythical places
and items, and so much more! The maybe one thing I thought was
interesting is that Annabeth turns into a blonde in this movie. What is
interesting than in both books Annabeth is a blond, but in the first
movie she's not a blond, but a brunet! That was really the only thing
that confused me. The director, Thor Freudenthal did a fantastic job
and so did the cast. I would have to say my favorite moment in this
film is when the gang calls a ""taxi"" to get them to Florida. The gang
is extremely scared of the three drivers wicked driving, and it turns
out that the kids don't have enough money to get to Florida! Uh oh!

I would have to recommend this film to ages 10 to 18. There is very
little language or any adult material at all. It may be a little scary
for younger ages though. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars because it
was simply brilliant. You can find it in theaters near you on August
7th.

A little disappointed Pierce Brosnan did not return as Chiron but that's okay, and surprised to see Nathan Fillion (as Hermes). The movie has action and special effects, and some laughs. We are given some background information, and we have some new characters. I certainly hope they come out with additional movies (of course they left it open for sequels).

The first movie was ok, but I have to say that this movie surpassed my expectations and was far better than the first movie! This movie is compelling and truly draws the viewer in and holds you from beginning to end. The movie was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The best part is how well they bring the book alive. While the book is still more in-depth, the writers and director did a great job at connecting you to the book which not all novel-based movies can purport. All-in-all this is a great movie that I highly recommend to all!

This is a decent movie if you've never read the books and don't ever plan on it..

Having said that..
If you're a fan of the books.. don't watch the movies.. because they are never even close.. They did much better this time for sure but it still wasn't even close to what the books are.. I'm quite disappointed actually because i preferred my own mental pictures when reading.. hopefully when i re read the books i will still enjoy them but the movies are just too off..

5800935,2,B00DHB419U,"After having watched the first movie I thought to give this one a go, wanting to see where the story would take me.  I have not read the books.

I was very disappointed with this movie. The first movie was about his discovery that he was the son of Poseidon, and was all about his character development where predictably at the end of the movie he came into his full power to defeat the anti-hero and save the day.  Predictable, yet somewhat original with great special effects and likable characters.

This movie however, contained many elements torn directly from the Illiad (The Odessy). The four winds contained in a thermos instead of a wine-bladder, yet used for the exact same purpose, to propel a ship (which would not have been necessary since there were not 1 but 2 sons of Poseidon on said boat, both with power over water).  This movie was riddled with face-palm moments where I think ""What's his problem, he's surrounded by water!!!"".  And when he does use the water to his advantage, it seems he uses it in the most ineffective, pointless manner possible.

I felt like this movie had taken all of the character development back to even before the first movie. It was all about his insecurity, where by the end of the first movie he had developed a total self-confidence and self-control. Annabel also seemed to take a backseat from the over-confident, dominant, stubborn warrior princess to Hermione from Hogwarts. The new character additions were so annoying with the bullying of the now down-and-out Percy that I thought he was going to contemplate suicide.

As such, I give it thumbs up for special effects and fight sequences (although in spots the fighting was  awkward and stiff). Zombies added another star. Just for showing up. The rest was so/so.",1386892800,,1769,4.773770491803279

There were many problems with Lightning thief, that I felt it was made in a way that they were not expecting to make any other films. They never referenced the bigger threat, and the real reason behind his quest.
This film attempts to fix that problem, and I say it did a very good job, while still managing to tell the story that the Sea of Monsters had to tell.
Kronos is the real threat through out the entire series, and I'm glad that we got to a representation of him, and a glimpse of what is to come.

5800954,3,B00DHB419U,"First off, I must confess that I haven't read any of the original series written by Rick Riordan. My review of Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, sequel to a 2010 fantasy adventure film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" is strictly that of an avid filmgoer.

As a film Sea of Monsters is not really that bad. The sequel has a good amount of action sequences and first-rate special effects (Colchis Bulls is pretty impressive). The film is about the new adventure of young demigod students of Camp Half-Blood, who are forced to find the legendary Golden Fleece, to revitalize the dying Thalia's tree.

Logan Lerman comes back as a demigod Percy Jackson, a slightly laid-back hero with a sense of humor, who takes us through the story at a brisk pace. Brandon T. Jackson and Alexandra Daddario are okay as his friends Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase, although I think the film could have given them more to do in the story. The same can be said about the fiercely competitive character Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), demigod daughter of Ares, who could have been more interesting with a well-written backstory. Perhaps I should have read the books.

Adult supporting actors include Stanley Tucci as Mr. D or Dionysus, and Nathan Fillion as Hermes. They are very effective comic relief, but even these talents can do little in a story that may be predictable for the fans of the genre. Director Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs Diary of a Wimpy Kid), who replaced Chris Columbus (who served as a producer here), did a serviceable job in continuing Percy Jacksons story that somewhat starts to look familiar, but still entertaining.

After all the sequel is fairly good, even though it has little to add to the popular genre of fantasy movies.",1385164800,2,1759,4.795379537953796

** Spoilers below**
Percy has quite a few challenges in this film, chief of which is an identity crisis. Having completed a quest successfully in the first film (Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief) he is finding himself inadequate in competing with other half-bloods, particularly Clarisse, who enjoys taunting him. Along with Percy's self-doubt, he discovers he has a half-brother named Tyson, who is a Cyclops.  Annabeth also has a loathing of Cyclopes', in general, because one killed a half-blood named Thalia, a daughter of Zeus no less. Zeus transformed his daughter into a tree that provides a barrier for Camp Halfblood. However, the tree is poisoned, so a quest is proposed to take the Golden Fleece as it alone can cure Thalia. Percy is not chosen to join the quest (Clarisse wins again) and so sets out with Annabeth, Grover and Tyson (who is reluctantly accepted) to prove that he is not a flash-in-the-plan hero. The quest has many pitfalls and ultimately Percy proves himself, discovers his true abilities and learns much about accepting people for themselves, faults and all.

**End Spoilers**

There are some very funny moments in the film with mythological characters. The cab ride with the Stygian Witches behind the wheel was great fun as was seeing Stanley Tucci playing Dionysus, who is being punished by Zeus by turning his wine into water. Hermes (played by Nathan Fillion) has his own package delivery business.  The one bizarre element in the film was a group of Confederate soldier zombies that are helping Clarisse. The scene where Percy consults the Oracle of Apollo was effectively spooky. The film is a great adventure for the family, appealing to both adults and children. The special effects are very good and the acting by Logan Lerman (Percy), Alexandra Dadarrio (Annabeth), Brandon T Jackson (Grover) and Douglas Smith (Tyson) is perfect for their characters.",1379894400,3,2262,4.89556135770235

5800962,5,B00DHB419U,"This is a story about special children growing up with absentee fathers who attempt to win their children's love with gifts while being worshiped as gods. In this installment Percy (Logan Lerman) and his friends go after an old sheep skin in order to save a tree. Meanwhile, bad guy Luke (Jake Abel) wants the fleece so he can revive his ancestor, Cronus known for eating his own young. Guess how that works out.

The film opens with a slight monologue to reintroduce the characters. Like the Potter series, the main character's acting in the low point. This film also has that hidden world within our own world aspect. The scenes boasts wonderful special effects. The individual scenes are more overpowering than the general plot designed to appeal to the pop culture youth. Leven Rambin was made up to look like Jennifer Lawrence running around with a bow. One can't help but draw to mind the block buster films of ""Hunger Games"" and ""Potter.""

This series seems designed for those slightly younger than the Potter crowd. The characters and plot lack the complexity and certainly less occult darkness.

A great film for the family to see, especially the older kids who aren't prone to nightmares. Contains a family message as Percy must learn to live with a half brother who is a cyclops.",1378080000,2,1290,4.7757847533632285

5800964,3,B00DHB419U,"I like the first movie of this series, ""Percy Jackson, The Lightning Thief"",  so much that I asked my friend to watch this movie in the theatre with me. Below is what I think about it.

- What make me like the most about the first film are the jokes. This one has less funny scenes.

- The special effects yield mixed result. The fire bull in the beginning scene looks lively and ferocious. The ""sea horse"" that acts as a ferry looks beautiful and life-like. However, the giant, fiery god in the last scene is disappointing. He looks fake. Clash of The Titans (2010) has the same special effect of the same character but it looks more convincing.

- The acting is acceptable.

- It contains no foul languages, no sex. So, it's suitable for a family movie.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:

UPDATED Sep. 24, 2013
Release Date: August 7, 2013
Production Budget: $90 million
Domestic:  $66,975,828
+ Foreign: $124,232,992
= Worldwide:  $191,208,820

So, it's a big flop in North America. However, people overseas love it. Globally, It took in 101 millions more than its production cost. That's a huge amount of money. I'm sure we'll see the next sequel by the end of 2016.

In short, it's worth watching once. It deserves 3 stars.",1377993600,,1280,4.644444444444445
5800965,3,B00DHB419U,"Great effects - the satyr and centaur look real (or pretty near), and other effects meet the best of the very high standards we've come to expect. Outside of that, the teen date-movie plot doesn't offer a lot. There's the friendly rivalry, set aside for the unfriendly rivalry. They also tucked in a nice message about accepting people who look a bit different, and a cyclops certainly looks differently. And don't forget the blatant bit of sequel-bait at the end, promising new conflicts in the inevitable follow-on project.

Barely worth the popcorn, but watchable.

5800968,4,B00DHB419U,"Thor Freudenthal (Diary of A Wimpy Kid, Hotel For Dogs) directed this sequel to the boy who was born to a human mother and one of the original Greek Gods, Poseidon. Marc Guggenheim (Green Lantern, Arrow) took the original novel from the very popular book series and written by Rick Riordan and did very a nice job at capturing the spirit and the heart of the story that is ""Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters"".

Logan Lerman (Stuck In Love, The Three Musketeers) reprises his role as Percy and this time his adventure is far more personal than he could have ever imagined. Percy finds out that he also has a half-brother named Tyson who happens to be a Cyclops and is wonderfully portrayed by Douglas Smith (Antiviral, The Boy Who Smells Like Fish). The two seem at odds, but Tyson innocence and sincerity really warm the hearts of everyone in the team and the audience.

The team is back and it consists of the other half-humans/half-Gods like Alexandra Daddario (Texas Chainsaw 3D, Parenthood) as feisty Annabeth, Brandon T. Jackson (Thunderstruck, Raising Hope) as Grover who is a real Satyr himself and Leven Rambim (The Hunger Games, One Tree Hill) as Clarisse the over-the-top female bully of the bunch.

One of the most interesting performances comes from Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, The Devil Wears Prada) playing Mr. D. who is the somewhat despondent caretaker of the fortress where all the Half-Gods are protected by a special tree that was made at the cost of the life of one of their own.

One of the best and funniest performances comes from Nathan Fillion (Castle, Firefly) who plays Hermes, one of the original three God's first created by the Titans - the Messenger of the bunch. Nathan is obviously having way too much fun with his character in speaking about himself and his abilities and the fact that he himself has a now estranged and wayward son named Luke, another Half-God.

Luke is basically the bad guy in this film, trying to assemble the original Titan who created all Gods and is played quite nasty by Jake Abel (The Host, I Am Number 4). All the kids are back with a few new ones added in the mix too.  The entire plot centers around saving the dying tree that protects the fort and stopping Luke from assembling the original Titan named Polyphemus (who is voiced by Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beats, Hellboy)) who is pure evil and wants to destroy all the Half-Gods and the entire world and every human on it. How? He east them. Yum!

There are wonderful effects including riding a wave on the ocean, a gigantic digestive system of a sea Monster as well as the creation and destruction of Polyphemus. They absolutely leave the ending open for a sequel but this film franchise has a smart heart, big story and wonderfully cast all the way around. Fun for the whole family!",1377129600,2,2805,4.643145161290323
5800969,3,B00DHB419U,"and it's the fault of that demigod-d*mn cast!

Here we go: a great movie with lots of fun, a great score, gorgeous over-the-top gimmicks such as misty taxis, talking serpents, cute cyclop half-brothers, marvellous fairy-tale creatures... you feel like being back in 2002, when the second Harry Potter film was released... the adventure is just to begin...

But what are these twenty-something-year-olds doing in our movie? Don't get me wrong. Logan Lerman is a gorgeous actor... in a young-adult coming-of-age story like ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower"" involving sex, drugs and rock'n'roll...Alex Daddario is great as a horror scream-queen as in ""Texas Chainsaw""...and Brandon T. Jackson is a great comedian. But NONE of them belong in this film series.

I know, it's the fault of the first movie, but they could have recast the kids and retconed the series instead of screwing up the entire series for good. We all know what made The Neverending Story, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia into great movies... they stayed true to its source material, getting the age of the characters right! Even adults love good children's films, but not at all such travesties that try to be both at the same time: children's fairy-tales disguised as young-adult comedy - Twilight-aged actors playing Harry Potter and the Golden Fleece...

It simply couldn't work out and this time, the box office numbers show the true scale of Chris Columbus' lack of foresight back in 2010... Why on Mount Olympus did he do that? He who gave us Harry P., Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire? He was the chosen one to turn this great book series into the next Harry Potter... Instead he destroyed not only these films but also the original books series for those actors will always haunt our mental projections of these characters...

Most changes are subtle and not noticed for most part. For example: In the book, they group went to the Sea of Monsters to get the fleece but also to rescue Grover who was taken by a cyclops. In the movie, only one of Grover's kind can lead heroes to the fleece. So, Grover goes with Percy, Annabeth and Tyson and he is then, kidnapped by Luke's men = Percy and company have to save him. A change but really, who cares? Point is, Grover is with the fleece and needs to be saved.

Other small changes would include

The trio taking the gray sisters's taxi from camp, not to camp like in the book.

The trio going to Hermes at the UPS store unlike him coming to camp. (book)

Hermes gives them the thermos and a tape dispenser. In the book, he gave them the thermos and a bottle of vitamens.

Luke, Thalia, Annabeth and Grover are chased by two Cyclopses in the movie. in the book, the furies are listed as those that chase them among other monsters.

The prophecy says a child of 20, in the book the age is 16.

Tyson already knew his father when he go to camp in the movie. in the book, he did not know.

Tyson and Percy are strangers in the movie but are friends in the book.

If you can live with these changes, then you will be ok with the movie.case closed.

The only slap to the face is the last 10 minutes of the movie. Spoiler.
 Kronos rises in the last 10 minutes of the movie and is sent back to his box by Percy, due to Kronos still being very weak. WTF! He rises and poof, he's safely back in the box. I wanted to scream and shout profanity at the writers.

They claim to have done it so it would show impending doom to follow (aka, the next 3 books).They also added monsters early like the Manicore. fine. more action= more money. ok, I can live with that.

All in all, I loved the movie. From the opening credits all the way to Kronos rising where I hated it. After that section of 10 minutes, when they get back to camp. the movie remains true to the book. Word for Word.

I'm happy for how far they have come compared to the first movie. Just, don't expect it to mirror the book. No movie ever does unless the author wrote the script like The Hunger Games.",1376352000,99,2455,4.128151260504202
