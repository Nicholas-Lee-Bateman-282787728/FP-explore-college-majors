8649662,3,B00JBR2R7M,"As a fan of Jack Benny, I have long sought to expand my episode collection, a deceptively complicated endeavor. Often, the same episodes will be released repeatedly on different disks. Sometimes a disk will turn up with all new material, sometimes with one or two episodes you can't get anywhere else. On other occasions, discs composed entirely of episodes you can get elsewhere for a better deal will appear. These disks frequently have no available episode guide, so telling these apart can often be hazardous. Even more confusing are customer reviews meant for one collection that have somehow ended up under another. I, the Jack Benny Trailblazer, through an extended period of careful research, mostly through purchasing the disk on a hunch and seeing what I got, am here to simplify matters.  Below are live links to each Jack Benny collection which I find most advisable to purchase found here on Amazon (although you may want an episode guide, I recommend the one on Wikipedia.org):

Best of Jack Benny (39 Episodes)
The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes (18 episodes)
Jack Benny - Comedy Pack (7 episodes)
The Best of Jack Benny (8 episodes)
The Best of the Jack Benny Show, Vol. 1 and 2 (17 episodes)
Jack At the Races Ed Sullivan/Genieve Show DVD (2 episodes) (Volume 3 of The Jack Benny Collection)

This portion of The Jack Benny Collection presents the only known source of an episode where Jack Goes to the Race Track (9 February 1958, episode 90) and meets Sheldon Leonard.  It also claims to have an earlier version of the Ed Sullivan episode (5 April 1959, episode 110) but it's actually the later one (5 November 1963, episode 211) which you can get for less trouble in the Jack Benny - Comedy Pack. From time to time, someone seems to purchase the complete parent box set, break up the collection, and sells the disks back to Amazon. However, this also means that this disk is frequently on the ""Currently Unavailable"" list. Unless you have an overwhelming pull to see the Benny movie The Medicine Man along with these episodes no matter what the cost, my recommendation is to put Volume 3 on a Wish List and hope.

You will find reviews like this one for each of the collections listed above.  May it be a useful tool to navigating the murky waters of Jack Benny DVD's. Also, be sure to watch for Jack Benny on Antenna TV.

Good Hunting!
