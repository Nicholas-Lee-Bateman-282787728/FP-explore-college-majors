8215566,5,B000UXSA5Y,"This dvd has alot of information, and is well done. It leaves nothing out on harnessing and driving mule teams. Most of the information is on driving. The two men that are breaking the mules are professionals. They explain everything that they are doing, and tell you why. They get alot accomplished ,and they are driving the mules the very first day. My husband and I really enjoyed watching their dvd. Nice guys. I would recommend this dvd.",1422230400,,442,4.67948717948718
8215567,5,B000UXSA5Y,This video actually shows green Mules being broke and trained unlike a lot of training videos that show already trained animals going through their paces. I haven't been able to use the method yet but have talked to others that have and they were very satisfied.,1411257600,2,262,4.717391304347826
8215568,5,B000UXSA5Y,"We have known about this method for 5 years and now are using it for the first mule in my four-up team with three to go.  Although they go a little overboard in working their mule students, the process allows a mule to become a valuable team member and working partner, not a pampered pet.  Mules handled in this manner are working partners valued by their partner owners.  The mules know they have a job and learn to do it well.  It is similar to a Marine boot camp experience.  You go to boot camp to become a hardened veteran, not a pampered spoiled brat.  Mules have a strong work ethic and want to be respected and valued for their work.  Once you change your perspective of how to look at working mules you will enjoy your mules for a lifetime.  I do think they go a little overboard in how hard they work their mules and I don't agree with the one scene where they whip the mules to teach them they must work even when sore.  There are other ways to do this.  But the mules learn as do Marines they have a job, pride, honor, and loyalty for life.  Mules were once the backbone of this country and again are gaining popularity.  If not completely broken and trained they are dangerous.  As valued and loyal partners they are inseparable from their owners for life.",1339286400,2,1270,4.30801687763713
