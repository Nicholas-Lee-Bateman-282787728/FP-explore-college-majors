Special Footnote, actor Allan Lane looked to better roles, he signed with Republic in 1940 ... after struggling a bit in his initial films, hit pay dirt after teaming with Linda Stirling in the popular serial ""The Tiger Woman"" (1944) --- his own serials with ""Daredevils of the West"" (1943) and ""King of the Royal Mounted"" (1940), Mountie Dave King proved popular and, around this time, he started gaining added attention as a photogenic and very personable cowboy star, with his trusty steed ""Blackjack,"" ... Lane managed to churn out a bucketful of oaters every year beginning with ""Silver City Kid"" (1944)), for nearly a decade, trading blows with the bad guy Roy Barcroft and seeing justice prevail ... best remembered these days for his dashing good looks and saddle appeal on film ... it's no small wonder that Allan Rocky Lane's name was at the top of the list, working with the top directors of the day Howard P. Bretherton, Spencer Gordon Bennett, Joseph Kane, Wallace A. Grissell, Leslie Selander and R.G. Springsteen all under Republic Pictures banner.

Second Special Footnote, Linda Stirling was the most popular action star of serials in the 1940s, she was spotted in an advertisement by executives of Republic Studios, who were looking for a beautiful but athletic woman to star in their upcoming serial, ""The Tiger Woman"" (1944). Despite having no experience in the kind of stunts and athletics that would be required, Stirling was able to convince not only the executives but ace stuntman Yakima Canutt of her capability. She won the role and a contract from Republic, and played hard-riding and -fighting heroines in numerous serials, Westerns, and low-budget adventure films over the next three or four years ... Stirling appeared in three other notable serials ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (1944), ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945) and ""Crimson Ghost"" (1946) ... where she rapidly earned the title ""Queen of the Serials."" ... She married Republic screenwriter Sloan Nibley in 1946, then retired from films the following year, had a family and once her children were grown Stirling enrolled at UCLA, eventually earning an MA, a BFA and--at age 50--a PhD ... dring 1960s, she began a whole new career as a teacher of college English and Drama.

7812578,4,6301216326,"Linda Stirling got to play the title role in two great Republic serials,  ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (yes, under that mask was the petite Ms.  Stirling) and this one, her first. She was doubled by a stuntwoman who made  her fighting and vine-swinging look quite good; she later confessed to not  knowing how to ride a horse or swing on vines. But this is a fun serial, in  which she gets support from Allan Lane (a popular serial star himself  before going on to make three, count 'em, three, well-received western  series) and Duncan Renaldo (another serial regular who gained fame at movie  and TV ""Cisco Kid"").
