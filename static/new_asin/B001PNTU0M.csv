8333977,3,B001PNTU0M,"I bought this one expecting it to be as amusing as ""Regular guys"" or ""Balls"". Unfortunately, it's not.
Don't read the comments on the cover cause they have barely something to do with the film.
I laughed maybe once or twice. Of course there are more funny moments, but they'd rather make you smile than laugh along loud.
Acting is good, but the action is rather slow, at least during the first half of the film.
To sum up: not bad, but Germans can do better :)",1309132800,,460,4.2988505747126435
8333978,3,B001PNTU0M,"""Fashion Victims"" (Reine Geschmacksache) is a 2007 film from Germany that tells the story of a comically dysfunctional family, led by an egotistical, controlling father who puts his family second to his success as one of the top salespeople for a women's clothing line. His wife and inching-out-of-the-closet gay teen son, Karsten, make allowances for dear old Dad, but draw the line when his risky financial decisions result in a tax lien on their home and the loss of the money meant for Karsten's college.  What's worse for Karsten is that he is denied the vacation in Spain he had planned with friends for the summer before starting college, and instead gets stuck driving around his father, Wolfgang, who lost his license for not taking care of a ticket.

Most of all, Wolfgang is nervous about Steven, a new, younger salesman who has been infringing on his regular customers, and stealing away sales he desperately needs.  While waiting for his father, Karsten runs into Steven, and the two of them immediately hit it off, and start dating.  It isn't until the comical whirlwind of events in the final 15 minutes of the film, that Karsten learns his ""dream man"" is his father's nightmare, making for a rather difficult coming-out for the young man, and a time for the father to reconsider his priorities.

A pleasant, light comedy with adequate acting and direction, though a bit drawn-out at 94 minutes. DVD has no extras except trailers and chapter stops. I give the film three stars out of five.",1240444800,2,1504,4.836575875486381
8333979,4,B001PNTU0M,"FASHION VICTIMS (Reine Geschmacksache) is an entertaining little film that seems to have its roots in the French farce genre: characters running topsy turvy into situations that include hidden identities, well paced plans that go awry for odd reasons, and in general a healthy look at human foibles.  Writers Tom Streuber and Ingo Rasper (who also directs) have dished up this confection with just the right amount of social comment, interpersonal relationship challenges, business antics, and family disasters to keep the comedy moving.  And fortunately they have a fine cast of excellent actors to assure its success.

Grumpy egocentric Wolfgang Zenker (Edgar Selge) is first a clothing line salesman in the fashion industry and second an abusive husband to Erika (Franziska Walser) and his closeted son Karsten (Florian Bartholomi), a young lad who yearns to go off to university to study Spanish but is shamed into being a driver for his father when the police reveal that Wolfgang has a suspended license.  One of Wolfgang's business competitors Steven Brookmller (Roman Knizka), a handsome young man with an eye for Karsten, parts company with Wolfgang - a fact that begins a chase of boutique visits and competition that alienates Wolfgang even further from his son and wife.  When Wolfgang's true financial picture is as bleak as possible, both Erika (encouraged by her single girlfriend Brigitta (Traute Hss) and Karsten elect to indulge in their own futures, and in a series of hilarious accidents the lives of all the characters collide and change.

Fast paced, well photographed, and warmly acted, FASHION VICTIMS is a fun film that though it is listed as a gay movie, there is little in the story other than some momentary suggestions to deserve that label.  This is a fun farce that should find a wide audience seeking a little escape from reality!  Grady Harp, March 09",1237680000,2,1884,5.074433656957929
8333980,1,B001PNTU0M,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I tried to like it, but it's just awful. Maybe I just don't get German humor, but to me this was a frenetic 96-minute barrage of (almost) universally unbelievable, completely obnoxious, cartoonish characters, stupider ""comic"" situations than you'd ever see on even the very worst TV sit-com, and ridiculous, extremely heavy-handed slapstick. The only even slightly redeeming feature is Florian Bartholomi in the lead role as Karsten. He's cute, sweet and charming, and he comes light years closer than anybody else to acting something like a real human being. I can't believe he'd ever have looked twice at a shallow jerk like Steven if he hadn't been the first man who ever paid attention to him. I'd like very much to see Bartholomi in a good movie, but unfortunately this is not it. This is a real lemon.",1235779200,2,862,4.831081081081081
8333981,4,B001PNTU0M,"(Alternate title for this review:  ""Thank god for espresso machines that make you take your clothes off."")---(Wait; how about one more alternate:  ""And when you pick up a guy, how do YOU get the conversation started?  Why, ask him his astrological sign, of course.  Works every time---don't believe me; just check with Steven and Karsten!).

((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

Not to be outdone in the year, 2007, of some quite good gay films (the Yank's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>"" and the Brit's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oh-Happy-Day-dvd/dp/B001B1T77E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oh Happy Day [dvd</a>]""), now comes along Germany's funnily enjoyable ""Fashion Victims.""  Featuring the Germanic version of Trevor Wright (a wonderfully ingratiating Florian Bartholomai as the late-teens to 20 year old, virginal Karsten), and a Teutonic Brad Rowe (a fun loving, but caring, Roman Knizka as the gay-experienced, 30-something Steven), here's a marvelous little movie I truly believe you're gonna love.  Why?  Because I so think you're going to like this guy, Steven, with his light-hearted and devilish approach to life.......and to getting our oh-so-innocent Karsten into bed for his very first time.  And I just know you're going to fall in love with relative newcomer Bartholomai in the role of the doesn't-know-what-to-do, young innocent in need of a ""guiding hand"" (no, no.....not a hand for ""that"" purpose; well, maybe there WILL come a time for that).  Karsten is played as just about the most lovable gay youth you're going to come across---he's so sweetly shy it almost pours off the screen. (I'll bet you thought ""Shelter's"" Zach was that person; I do have to admit:  it's a hard call).  And as for the fun-to-be-with Steven, let's just say that he's more than eager to give our little Karsten the guidance he's in need of.  And if you closely watch, you will see that ""K's"" presence always seems to put a grin on the devilish Steven's face.  Gotta say that ""S"" does have great eyes---just watch them closely anytime he's with Karsten......they practically devour the kid throughout the film.

If there's any bad news for those of you looking ONLY for gay romance, it's that you'll have to wade through a lot of ""family stuff"" first.  In this regard, Karsten's parents can't be left out of consideration here; actually much of this movie involves them.  In fact, it's not really a ""gay film,"" per se; it's more of a ""family affair kind of thing"".......with Papa being front and center for most of the film, and Mama having her little bits from time to time. Papa Wolfgang pretty much comes across as a know-it-all S.O.B., which throughout the film poses a big question for us:  Is he going to wind up being redeemable in our eyes (and Karsten's......and Mama's)?  As for Mama Erika (who knows more than a certain someone thinks she does), she turns out to be her sweet boy's loving and supportive fallback person.......and, most wonderfully, she takes no crap from anyone.  What we really have with these two older characters, then, are parents playing at their own little war.

Speaking of ""war,"" perhaps this is the best point to mention that ""Fashion Wars"" might have been a far better title for this film, inasmuch as it certainly does have its share of skirmishes (well, admittedly, its share of ""victims,"" too).  Of course, who knows how ""twisted"" words become when translating German to English for subtitling purposes (in that regard, I can say there were certainly some noticeable ""rough spots"" in this film).

Just a few wrap-up thoughts for you here:

 - Not to be forgotten, there's that brilliantly done home bedroom segment in which Karsten receives both an unexpected visitor and his first kiss. It's one of ""those"" scenes in which the viewer finds him/herself almost physically holding their breath in anticipation (and Steven really, really does outdo himself here).

 - When the film's long-a-coming ""showdown"" finally does arrive, it's pretty much a doozie. Yes, indeed, you are going to love this film's final ""action"" scene (NO, not ""that"" kind of action---keep a clean mind why dont'cha).  All I'll say is that it involves a vehicle......and a shotgun......and some sidesplitting moments.

 - The film-end denouement between father and son is near pitchperfect.  It is a memorably happy moment, even topping Mama's wonderful final scene with ""K"" (""I know---I understand---I accept"").  What more could any gay boy ask for?

 - And, other than the preceding, all I have to say is:  I am so mad at you, Mr. Director!  Why?  Well, it seems to me that a little see-you-later kiss through a vehicle window, at film's end, would certainly have been a great way to wind up the guys' final scene (must I do all the thinking for you guys?).  Nevertheless, thanks for an otherwise wonderful little ending scene between the two; your gay audiences always appreciate being left with a feeling of hope.

PS--Oh yes, oh yes........you're gonna have fun with this one.
