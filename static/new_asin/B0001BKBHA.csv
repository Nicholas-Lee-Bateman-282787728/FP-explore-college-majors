8009818,5,B0001BKBHA,"This video really helped explain to me what exactly Dianetics is and how it works. The book is very long, and can be tough to get through - I'm in the middle of reading it now. But the video clarifies some of the basic concepts, so I fully understand the goals and basic theory behind it.

After watching the video, I felt competent to take my sister in session - and she really enjoyed the sessions and felt she made some progress in dealing with a terrible loss she experienced early in life. I felt great knowing I'd actually helped her!

I have watched the video a few times, and once I've finished the book, I'll watch it again.",1121817600,6,633,4.310924369747899
8009819,3,B0001BKBHA,"Dianetics is a kind of psychotherapy, using memory flash back rehearsal to clear unpleasant experiences that subconsciously lead to negative impacts. For details, you may want to read the 600 pages best seller book Dianetics by the same author Ron Hubbard, but this DVD is able to give you a quick sample and taste of Dianetics in half hour.
The DVD contains no extra features but you can select a langauge from a variety of choices, no subtitles but english close captioned. The total run time is about 40 minutes not the 100 minutes stayed in the technical information page at amazon.com. The film shows you how Dianetics works in three parts: (1) Understanding our mind, sensors, & memory, (2) Dianetics What/Why/How, (3) Demonstration on how you & your friends can conduct a Dianetics auditing session.
Overall, I find it's interesting, easy to understand, and the concept is very close to some Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques. Especially the last part about conducting a Dianetics auditing session, it's very detailed and shows you in step-by-step way of what the auditor should say and do. The DVD also includes a pamphlet that states all the steps and procedures for running a Dianetics session. It's very helpful. It will be much appreciated if the DVD provides more different auditing scenarios and detail concepts.",1083715200,18,1338,5.0588235294117645
8009820,5,B0001BKBHA,"This DVD is a must for everyone who is doing well in life and anyone who is not. It answers questions previously unknown for centuries.
In the opening words of this book hubbard says - you are begining an adventure, treat it as an adventure and may you never be the same again.",1083369600,13,277,4.245283018867925
8009821,5,B0001BKBHA,"If you are interested in helping people, and interesting in knowing the fastest, most effective way of doing that, then I highly recommend this video!
I wish I had this information when I was a rape crisis counselor - it would have made my job a whole lot easier. There IS a method that works to relieve people of the weight of the past. Past losses, past failures, past painful experiences, do not have to follow a person for the rest of their lives. People CAN overcome the negative effects of these experiences, and this video will show you how.
If you know ANYONE who has suffered in the past, who is still carrying around shadows of these harmful experiences, then I highly recommend that you get this video, and sit down with them and watch it.",984441600,18,750,4.481751824817518
