8565479,4,0964144700,"This video is simply a taped recording of the construction of two dollhouses from start to finish. It looks like a home movie in its simplicity, and demonstrates clearly how easy it is to begin making dollhouses without the need for expensive tools or a lot of woodworking skills.
The first segment demonstrates the construction of a simple starter dollhouse, and the second segement the construction of a larger, more complex dollhouse. This video is a great place to start for those considering building a dollhouse and those who are beginning their first one.",1010102400,,562,4.98936170212766
