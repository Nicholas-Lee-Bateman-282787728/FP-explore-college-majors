8588534,5,B00D2CS4LK,"Someone gave me a copy of this DVD (maybe the giver knew I needed to start doing Qi gong again) and though normally I'm not that great at following videos, this one I really like.  Edna's movements are clear, unambiguous, and flow like water. It's obvious she's a master at Qi gong, and from what I've read elsewhere, many other styles of internal exercises as well.  Her concentration and focus are communicated well to the viewer and have inspired me to re-start my own practice, after many years.  I also love the sound track.  A good sound track can enhance these kinds of videos and a poor one can wreck them!  The music is lovely and just fits.  I look forward to more Qi gong instruction from her.  I would highly recommend this video to those who are already familiar with Qi gong and beginners.

Her teaching style reminded me of when I first learned Tai Chi many years ago from an old Chinese man in a Honolulu park.  He didn't speak a word, just did the sequences over and over again, for us to follow.  I actually learned very quickly, much more than from teachers who just go bit by bit and do a lot of talking.",1377216000,2,1124,4.360576923076923

I've been practicing it for quite a while now.  It helps me with a lot of health issues in my body, i had pain in my back and disappeared after doing Qi-kung for a few days.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Qi-Gong-For-Everyone-Part-1/dp/B00D2CS4LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Qi-Gong For Everyone Part 1</a>",1371081600,,523,5.842105263157895
