7936140,1,B00005AX7B,"This show was utter crap. This cartoons proves that not all cartoons from the old days were very good. The cartoon had tons of unbearable gross humor (Ren and Stimpy and Cow and Chicken had done much better) with no logical plots whatsoever. It's a 90s cartoon that I don't recommend your kids (or young cousins, nephews, nieces or friends) to see.",1367625600,,348,4.629032258064516
