2941473,1,B000VHY8UK,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!  This is the worst presentation I have ever watched-

Its more like a power point presentation witha  a lava lamp used for special effects and some funky music that played in the back ground. Only someone on LSD trippin out would understand this DVD.

There was no speaking, no acting, no explainations about any of the topic this DVD was supposed to present. I have never askked for my money but this time I am, only because this DVD was that bad.

Plus the information was rediculas. I am ashamed I even bought this-
BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY",1190160000,14,567,4.3619047619047615
2941480,3,B000VHY8UK,"While the ""film"" part of this DVD isn't the most interesting, the information in it is priceless.  I simply played it while I did some chores and tending to some other things around the house.  Who doesn't like hearing about life after death and alternate realities?!  Surely, we must exist in some form when our bodies have died.  To think that we simply exist no more seems like an absolute waste of time in being alive at all.  Why have thoughts and feelings and logic if we're nothing more than ants?  That's the main reason I enjoyed Gateways to the Otherworld.  It delves deep into the mysteries of the pyramids, the fact that our ancestors may have had a way to tap into other realms, and healing methods that are ancient but could prove helpful to this day.  For an interesting blend of mysticism and science, I'd recommend this film.",1274486400,,842,4.566666666666666
2941481,3,B000VHY8UK,"Philip Gardiner suggests a ""gateway"" to the afterlife and offers as evidence a variety of beliefs from a vast array of cultures.  It's all interesting, but making the leap to the conclusion ""therefore there is another world"" is still a leap of faith and not science, I think.  Since all sorts of people throughout the ages believed in another world, that doesn't necessarily make it true, despite all the connections, coincidences and circumstantial evidence Gardiner presents in this DVD.

More convincing is Gardiner's attempt to reconcile Quantum Physics with religious belief.  The possibility of amazing dark and fantastic occurrences is truly intriguing and really sparks the imagination.",1273017600,,694,5.457943925233645
2941482,3,B000VHY8UK,"I have seen nearly all of his DVDs and read most of his books.  I admire his ability to gather information.  Some of his books are real gems.  Other times, I get the impression he has rushed some material together for the sake of publishing something new.  I think this one falls in to the ""rushed"" category.

There are some good points in the movie, but I think this is better rented than bought.",1257120000,,397,4.3108108108108105
2941483,5,B000VHY8UK,I just learned that the earth and human DNA have the same frequency and that frequency is F# (sharp). F# (sharp) frequency can transfer energy and information. So if we use our super conscious or unconscious mind to tune into that frequency we can go to another world after this life.  I am speechless; this film has blown my mind.,1236124800,,331,4.516666666666667
2941484,1,B000VHY8UK,"What are you expecting when you buy a DVD? I was expecting to have a narrator take me places and discuss what we were looking at. I expected to see moving pictures with people in them talking to me or showing me things. I was expecting that the DVD version would provide me with something a book would not. From the intro, where they play an entire folk song while you watch still images of little interest dissolve into each other, to the film itself which only adds narration to the same intro format, this DVD is unbearable and I will not watch it again...EVER.

This is nothing more than a series of processed images set to annoying songs that alternate between vaguely medieval sounding OOh-ahh music and loud ear spliting fiddle music. Worse yet, the images seldom have anything to do with the narration and are low resolution. That means they are twice as annoying on your big screen TV.

Cheesy dissolves of the universe fade into stained glass church windows and then its on to shots of the same boat sailing past a city in different colors. Halfway through this hour long film, you begin to notice that most of the images are being reused continuously. It is as if someone said I'll make a slide show while you read passages from your book and we will sell it for lots of money. There are tons of ugly polarized images and they repeatedly show a shot of the horizon and a bad model of earth which appears to be made of Paper Mache. When the images do match the discussion, you don't get much. An example is the roughly drawn still of the interior layout of the great pyramind. Is the one you have seen often enough to draw yourself and he ""animates"" it by changing its color several times.

The information is interesting but hard to listen to because the music is so loud. If you want to know about this subject by this author, buy the book. Believe me you'll be begging for it by the end of this pseudo-film. This is an annoying waste of time. It is by far the worst DVD I have ever bought and I teach film. I also bought the the one on the Thoth Cross. It has a wailing guitar in the background of what could have been an interesting narration...and yes...constant interludes of folk singing set to computer images of the Thoth cross dissolving in different colors. You couldn't pay me to own another film by this company, Reality films. I would suspect that this entire series has similar production values and should probably be avoided.

You may notice that even the reviewers linked to magazines that make their money hawking films like this give relatively low marks to some of the DVD's in this series. Read the low reviews first and if any echo what I've said here, heed their advice. You may also notice as I did (too late) that with one or two exceptions ALL OF THE 4 and 5 star reviewers of Gardiners films appear on ALL of Gardiner's films and for the most part are given low marks by other reviewers. They also don't seem to have much of a review history beyond his films. What does that suggest to you??

UPDATE:  I made the mistake of using the fast forward on my new Sony Blu-ray player to advance through the film. It stalled my player so badly that I could not even turn it off and had to unplug it and then restore power to eject the DVD. I tried to again fast forward to the picture I wanted and the same thing happened. This product is seriously flawed.",1227139200,15,3386,4.392344497607655
2941485,4,B000VHY8UK,"Looking at the possibilities of varying realities within us sounds like something out of a science fiction movie or book but in this film, Gardiner addresses it as a reality.  This second installment to Quantum Mind of God is just as interesting and thought provoking.",1206576000,,268,4.955555555555556
2941486,3,B000VHY8UK,"Philip Gardiner has already proved himself well-equipped to handle the philosophical implications of his theories in several books on esoteric topics, and this latest DVD is no exception. Exploring versions of the great beyond, from multiple cultures and perspectives--and linking them together with the intangible threads of quantum theory--Gardiner concludes that neither is as remote as we once imagined, nor as fearful.
''The DVD's five-minute opening seems a bit incongruous with its bluesy background music and sepia-toned scenes inside a blurry cave, but eventually it settles down into something more coherent, following images of stars and galaxies trickling down to the smallest, least definable particles of matter, a macrocosmos spewing out the essence of life in miniature and recycling its contents in an endless dance. From these images, Gardiner delves into the concept of the ""gateway,"" the underworld where the heroes of Celtic legend rest, or a passage to another consciousness, or even the parallel universes predicted in a quantum-ruled universe.
''As divergent as these all might seem, they all offer hope, a bolster against the uncertainty of life and the possibilities of a better existence in the hereafter. Gardiner sees this universal trait as the origin of consciousness and of all religion. Moreover, throughout history, certain symbols and harmonies have woven their way through our consciousness, and their universality testifies to their ability to transport our minds and spirits.
''A fascinating reassessment of history in light of one of science's most pondered and least-understood fields, Gateways to the Otherworld makes for compelling viewing.

2941487,3,B000VHY8UK,"This is the second film in the 2-part ""Quantum Mind of God"" series.  Gardner combines ancient spiritual teachings with modern quantum physics to explore the ideas surrounding life after death.  He connects all of this to ancestral ""truths"" dealing with health and healing, universal harmony, and time/realm travel.
To be honest, the production quality of the film could be a bit better, but this doesn't detract too much from the fascinating content.",1205020800,,450,5.236111111111111
2941488,3,B000VHY8UK,"In this interesting sequel to The Quantum Mind of God, Philip Gardiner brings the science of quantum physics and his knowledge of ancient cultures together to answer the question: is there life after death?

Fascinating subject to listen to, and the idea that ancient man had knowledge of and put into practice these things that we are just now rediscovering is amazing.",1199923200,,370,4.967741935483871
2941489,3,B000VHY8UK,"This is a continuation of the subject matter in Quantum Mind of God with Philip Gardiner. This installment discusses the significance of ""the void,"" or the part of atoms and the universe that cannot be seen, rather than what we can see, also that we are all balanced genetically with the resonance of the earth (the chord F#) and should be able to understand information that way. While the computer graphic and other visual effects make it easy to watch, the information is somewhat esoteric and it is helpful to know about the subject matter.",1199318400,,544,4.7368421052631575
8218656,1,B000VHY8UK,"Not put together well at all.

It was more of a promotion to buy his book.

His accent was hard to understand, and there are no subtitles available.

8218657,1,B000VHY8UK,Very amateurish with little substantial facts. Loud annoying music drowns out the video.,1434931200,,88,5.846153846153846

8218660,4,B000VHY8UK,"four stars, because the trailer seemed a bit inconsistent with the content of the documentary. I was not expecting a summary of every religions interpretation of gateway and and void, etc, although it is a well-represented mater. I knew most of this information beforehand, and when I saw the trailer I expected a documentary that would discuss how to experience the other realms in a more practical manner, rather than the summary of what it meant in other religions etc. But overall good movie. Also, the accent was hard to understand, and there are no subtitles at all available. In addition, I would raise the volume every time narrator would talk, but as soon as he stopped, music would blast in super loud ruining my concentration... A little technical aspect to keep in mind for improvement of future productions.",1386115200,,820,4.906474820143885
8218661,5,B000VHY8UK,Phil Gardiner is a favorite of mine. There is lots of high quality info here for the discerning individual. Thumbs up!,1355875200,,118,4.666666666666667

8218663,1,B000VHY8UK,...the music wasn't louder than the man giving the lecture and the abstract backgrounds weren't annoying and confusing.  Some of what I was able to hear was interesting. Domenica A. Amore',1314921600,2,188,5.064516129032258
8218664,2,B000VHY8UK,"I was excited to see this and ordered it.  BUT the narrator talks so fast with a heavy British accent, and the music is too loud in nearly every segment and competes with the already too-speedy words.

I have the ability to adjust my TV for audio, but nothing I did helped.  The music just drowned everything out, so I rarely caught even a phrase; I was stressing out trying to watch this thing becaues the product development was so off.

I wanted to contact Gardiner, but there is no easy way to do it.  The product needs to be reconfigured as to be usable.  Visually, it is stunning, throughout.  But I feel so cheated.  I had to give up on it.  What a waste of something that could have been so wonderful.",1309478400,2,709,4.2706766917293235
8218665,1,B000VHY8UK,"I usually prefer not to dump on someone's work, but this is so badly done, I don't know where to begin. The video production itself is horrible - audio is very badly mixed - voices too soft one minute and music blasting you out of your seat the next. The first 4 minutes or so are essentially a music video with no introduction, explanation or connection to the program material.

The video and images which should be reinforcing the narration are totally disconnected and have virtually no connection whatsoever. It is like the worst 80s music video you can possibly imagine.

The music also has absolutely no relation to the images or the narration. This is a completely disjointed production, and very badly done.

Bad production could be partially forgiven if the content were compelling. It isn't even close. The narration is a mishmash of poorly thought out and misunderstood concepts thrown together in a rambling, nearly incoherent manner. There is a complete lack of focus and progression of information, no introduction, no discernible plan or line of reasoning to follow.

The narration is basically a series of headline-like statements with no clear train of thought or reasoning to develop ideas and back them up. It ""invokes"" concepts rather than explains them, and throws diverse terminology around like an out-of-control lawn sprinkler, usually incorrectly.

The concepts and ideas as stated display an amazing lack of knowledge of science and metaphysics which is all too common these days in New Age circles. Lots of flowery dialog, no real substance. For example,  a statement is made to the effect that ""space is here to keep the planets apart."" It is also stated that 7.83 hz is ""exactly between alpha and theta brainwaves, but that is not true - the boundaries between those states are not fixed, but somewhat arbitrary and certainly not exact.

At one point, it is stated that the Schumann frequency is 1.855 hz, then later that it is 7.83 hz (which is more accurate). Also, the terms ""note,"" key,"" and ""frequency"" are used interchangeably, despite the fact that they are very different things. The narrator talks about the frequency of the Earth and human DNA being F sharp, but never does give the exact frequency in hz (Hertz, or cycles per second). F Sharp is the name of a musical note which can have many different frequencies, depending on octave and tuning system used. At one point, he also uses the term ""key of F sharp,"" which is yet another thing altogether.

Also, the term ""limelight"" comes from the use of calcium carbonate as stage lighting and involved heating it with a flame, not rubbing it as stated in this video.

In short, this is a badly produced video with no information worth wasting time and money to try and ferret out through all the noise. Pass it by quickly. I rented it and wasted an hour of my life.

Oh, I did like the narrator's Scottish accent.",1296000000,3,2904,4.801603206412826
