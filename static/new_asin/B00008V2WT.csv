1862770,4,B00008V2WT,"I love this video because it brings alive historical events by showing my students that those who saved the world from tyranny looked a lot like them.  Historical documentories are usually in Black and White so that the people look like relics from history.  Color changes everything.  I think this is a rather good collection of clips that tells a great story.  It does not gloss over racism and bigotry that existed in America and the in the Military, it shows our triumph in spite of those things.

The fact that Martin Sheen narrates enhances the experience for me rather than detracts.  He is a good actor, who knows how to tell a good story.  This is America, after all, and one is entitled to make a living regardless of his or her politics.  Isn't that what WWII was about?

This film gives an interesting and sometimes painful view of our country's greatest effort--the defeat of Facism.  It is well worth the time it takes to watch, no matter who narrates.",1093305600,15,966,4.5964912280701755
1862771,1,B00008V2WT,"Martin Sheen narrating a military documentary? That's like saying Apocalypse Now was an accurate portrayal of the Vietnam War (Vietnam; the sole template liberals use when discussing any military action). My father is a veteran on WW2, and I will not insult him by purchasing a product narrated by make believe president Martin Sheen.",1073260800,6,334,5.203703703703703

7987224,5,B00008V2WT,"The color film really adds a new dimension to yet another retelling of the dramatic WWII story. The footage showing wartime USA is very interesting. People look real here because they were. The battle scenes come alive unlike in b&w footage which always looks like something from ancient history. The narration focuses on letters sent home by American GIs, many of whom didn't make it. Watching is a very emotional experience. Bravo!",1238889600,,433,5.027777777777778
7987225,5,B00008V2WT,"From original color film footage comes this new 4 part video, narrated by Martin Sheen, and re-telling the stories of many actual participants in the war, especially from the American point-of-view. I don't care if Martin Sheen may be opposed to war in general. think,,, Most americans at the time were opposed to war! Until we got attacked ourselves... Then we entered and fought hard, to defend the world. Make no mistakes about it WW2 times were not psycologically confused or ambigous times for the americans, we knew exactly who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. This was no vietnam or iraq. Hitler's evil forces killed thousands in death camps and attacked us on the battlefields... This film shows these stories and tells them in such a way that is understanding, respectful, and done with honor to the allies. The Perilous fight is the one world war two documentary to have in your collection that you can show in school, that you can watch with a loved one, and to watch to truly remember the sacrifice that the allies made against an axis of evil in the 1940's... This film is done with reverence, and with great tidbits of factual details showing the changing times and civil rights battles that also occured during the era. I love the perilous fight, and Martin Sheen is a great narrator for this film, I could not think of a better narrator at all. Thank you.",1185667200,6,1384,4.630081300813008
7987226,5,B00008V2WT,"I enjoyed all four hours of this video. I lived through that period in time and remember it vividly. The color and video quality were excellent. This video is as good as any other I have seen. The film ""is what it is"" a collection of color clips taken by people who never heard of Martin Sheen.

 A few reviewers describe it as being innacurate and biased and berrating Martin Sheen while calling him un-American etc. I don't believe that they saw the video at all only because Martin Sheen narrated it. Apparently, these people are fans of Ann Coulter. If anyone is biased it is they. Martin Sheen only narrated (which I thought he did very well), he didn't write the script. Don't let a few Extreme Right Wing Radicals deprive you of an enjoyable video.  Biased??? Oh, give me a brake.",1153526400,7,787,4.489510489510489
7987227,1,B00008V2WT,"Perilous fight is a thinly veiled re-edited version of World War II.  Having read dozens and dozens of books on World War II and viewed numerous histories, as well as having visited historical sights related to WWII, both in Asia and Europe, the information here was so politically biased as to be ludicrous in its anti-war stance.  It is no surprise then that the well known actor and anti-war activist Martin Sheen is its narrator.  Insulting to the intelligence of the average person.  Reading or viewing personal narratives of American soldiers and American prisoners of war in the Pacific arena would be far more enlightening as to what the U.S. was truly fighting for, not this poor re-write of history that is blatantly anti-American, Anti-war and Anti-truth.  One of the least accurate ""histories"" I have come across.  The only saving grace of this DVD is the color footage from the time period. Not recommended.",1148601600,3,920,4.941558441558442
7987228,5,B00008V2WT,"Over the decades, I have watched hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours of documentary film on W.W.II.  Most all of these films have been in b&w, but I have not seen a feature length documentary of this quality devoted solely to color film.

I was skeptical as to the merits of the film since only a small percentage of W.W.II film was in color.  However, the PBS producers out did themselves in achieving a superb documentary.  The main fault with the film was the occasional disjointed telling of the story so that the film could continue with only color footage.  However, the overall effect was compelling enough to forgive these infrequent intrusions.

What makes this documentary unique from the very few other color-documentaries is the producers finding so many home made films by soldiers' families.  This brought the story to a more intimate level than many other such films.  Also, I became emotional in listening to many of the letters written by soldiers and their loved ones.  In one particular case, a marine officer writes eloquently to his very young children to speak about himself in case he should not return to them.  All the while, the viewer watches home movies of this marine with his infants and his wife.  We then learn that the marine died in action.  If that scene alone is not worth supporting the viewing of this film, then you've got very cold blood in your veins.

The World at War series (filmed in b&w) is still the best overall documentary of this subject (especially the dvd version with the extra features).  However, Perilous Fight is a must have dvd and it would go far to better educate our children about the war, and the troubled period of this nations history when the war was fought.  That is not to degrade the b&w films, but I really noticed things in Perilous Fight footage that I can't always say were as obvious in b&w versions.  For example, the sometimes beauty of the scenery in which some of the bloody battles were fought.

Finally, for those who oppose this film because of the narrator, I guess the overused phrase ""Get over it"" comes to mind.  My father was a W.W.II vet and I'm sure that he would have loved to have seen this film.  Can you imagine not watching the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston, or The Searchers with John Wayne just because you didn't like their political views?  That kind of criticism is beyond odd, it's just plain childish logic.  Besides, if one were to attribute politics to the narrator of this documentary, then one could only conclude that the narrator is highly patriotic and holds great empathy for the W.W.II vet since that is the message from this film.

P.s., there is much footage of dead, severely wounded, and dismembered bodies including Americans.  The viewer should exercise careful judgment about allowing pre-teens to see the whole of this film.",1115683200,13,2851,4.75
