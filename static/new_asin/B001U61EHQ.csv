8342928,5,B001U61EHQ,"Wow, this DVD may have just saved my marriage! Sounds a bit dramatic but I didn't understand at all what my wife was going through with this menopause stuff. It's not like I thought she was faking it, I just thought she had changed and it was like she was a different person. As a sportscaster, I used to love to go on the road just to get a break.

I got a lot of helpful information from this DVD and I was entertained and had a few laughs along the way. I learned from professionals that these menopause symptoms are very real and can be sometimes devastating for my wife and myself as well. I got some great tips on how to have empathy and compassion as she's going through this and this video has given us a lot of hope. I highly recommend this.

8342929,2,B001U61EHQ,"I purchased this DVD for my husband who is dealing with my many different issues at present.  He was hoping for some humor relief that he could identify with.  I am a nurse and can and have given him all the literature regarding menopause.  I think it was good that information was integrated into this video but it certainly lacked what he was hoping for......A chance to feel like other men going through the same thing.  A chance to sit back and laugh....more ""mens"" views on how they feel....a chance for him to release his stress through laughing because he could identify with the very things others like him are going through.  I thought for what we got it was very expensive as well the shipping cost me just as much as the video....$40 was way too much to spend.  It would have been nice to have ""men gossiping"" about what they are going through so when one of our mood swings hit he can go watch and identify with the countless others going through the same thing.  I wouldn't recommend for guys who are looking for a stress relief from their moody wives.  Not worth it.",1256515200,,1080,4.446700507614213
8342930,5,B001U61EHQ,"All of this dvd had something important to offer husbands, boyfriends and significant others.  It made a difference for my husband and myself and he said he wished that it had been available for his father back when his mom was experiencing menopause.  All through it I kept saying ""see! see!  that's me!!"" and it gave him a great new perspective with no man bashing.  The couple therapy section was terrific and all the skits were paced so as not to make it all too serious.  The doctor, Tori Hudson, was SO informative.  The whole thing gave us hope we might survive the next fun menopausal years and helped him so much.  Which, obviously, helps me.  And the handbook's great for reinforcing the info and having something handy to refer too.",1247616000,,743,4.6183206106870225
