It's got it all in a 3 hour original presentation unlike any motion picture you've ever seen from Cullen Films International.",1332115200,5,265,5.463414634146342
8498458,1,B006HH5ZPK,"this has to be one of if not the worst piece of cinematic trash I has ever been my mispleasure to view, who do I sue to get the hour and a half of my life back that I lost(wasted) watching this monumental stinking pile of ****. DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES back away from this page as fast as possible. Acting non-exsistant untrained pigs could have given better performances, this movie makes heavens gate seem like gone with the wind. If there is a just and merciful god every copy and negative of this film will be distroyed beyond recognition and re-use.",1331683200,3,564,4.4326923076923075
