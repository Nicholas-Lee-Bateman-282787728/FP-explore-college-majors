8308977,5,B001HMFCRQ,These G rated movies were a breath of spring.  Each one was well presented and acted.  They had the verissimilatude and tenderness that made me feel that the characters were real and feeling people.  I think the story was meant to touch my heart and it did.  I intend to send them to my children so they can enjoy them too.,1281225600,2,323,4.245901639344262
8308978,3,B001HMFCRQ,"Finding good, clean entertainment these days is a hard thing to do, so having 3 boys ages 16 to 12, I was very excited to find this adventure pack from Hallmark.  Hallmark has a reputation for clean movies with a positive message so I felt pretty safe getting movies I knew nothing about.  I read the reviews, looked at all the information provided and didn't find anything that seemed objectionable.  I was very disappointed when I actually got them because there were several of the six movies that were listed as having profanity and violence in them.  I expected some violence because they were adventure movies, but not profanity. I haven't actually had a chance to watch the movies, yet, but I wanted to make other conscientious buyers to be informed.",1261958400,21,757,4.755725190839694
8308979,4,B001HMFCRQ,"We purchased this set without knowing what was in it.  While not every movie is a blockbuster, most of them are good.  My wife uses them on the exercise machine.  Overall a pleasing package.",1237507200,5,190,4.529411764705882
8308980,4,B001HMFCRQ,"This set includes the titles:

SUPERNOVA

THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE

MYSTERIOUS ISLAND

MERLIN'S APPRENTICE

ICON

THE CASE OF THE WHITECHAPEL VAMPIRE

You can find out details on each by looking at reviews here on Amazon or checking out the Hallmark.com site. I was only familiar with ""Mysterious Island"" and ""Merlin's Apprentice"" when I bought this set, but I enjoy most Hallmark movies and the price was great. Seriously less than eighteen dollars for six movies, probably at least three of which you will thoroughly enjoy. I especially enjoyed ""Icon"" with Patrick Swayze along with the other two I mentioned above and the other three aren't bad. A pretty decent set and great for family entertainment. The Amazon descriptions above will give you a pretty good idea of what the movies in this set are about. Good quality DVDS with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch Hallmark Collector Set V.1 (6-Movies).

8308981,2,B001HMFCRQ,The description only says 6 movies is in this set...but it fails to say what those six movies is...leaving me with questions about it.,1230249600,6,134,4.625
