2468851,5,B000CPSPYG,"This is a retro film series from the 70's and early 80's. I am a retro buff, so I may be a bit prejudice, but I thoroughly enjoyed all of them! Great retro Left Behind series!",1352160000,,175,3.888888888888889
2468852,5,B000CPSPYG,"I saw the 1st one in college & it really affected me, but later when I tried to recall the name I had forgotten; so doing a search now took me a long time to find it - but the moment I saw the title I remembered & now want to watch the whole series. Thank you to listmania.",1334966400,,273,3.6440677966101696
2468853,5,B000CPSPYG,I saw this as a teenager. It was more than I remembered. I would watch it again and have anyone I care about watch it. It will really make you think about what is really important.,1333756800,3,180,4.027777777777778
2468854,3,B000CPSPYG,"I saw these movies years ago-- at the behest of friends. I was a rather conservative Christian at the time, but even then I thought these were hilariously bad movies. I probably seriously warped the kids by allowing them to watch them (they were teenagers, but I'm sure it still scared them, and not in a good way). I understand that some Christian groups still use these in their ministry, which makes me roll my eyes. But hey, if you can't use reason to turn the unrepentant, then maybe these movies will do the job.",1282089600,5,518,4.463157894736842
2468855,5,B000CPSPYG,This series would be great for evangelizing and teaching.  Not everyone is taught on the subject of the Rapture or the Tribulation.  A lot of churches steer away from it and/or not have been taught themselves.  A must see.,1266537600,11,222,4.641025641025641
2468856,5,B000CPSPYG,"I saw this the first time when I was a teenager at a youthgroup function.  Yes it is scary, but the truth sometimes is.  There is another review on here that says the ""rapture"" is not biblical.  You should read your bible more closely, because it most certainly is in there.  We shall be caught up in the air after the dead in Christ are taken.  Christians will be removed from the hell on earth that is coming.  Great depiction of how christians will be persecuted and murdered for His name's sake.",1250208000,4,499,4.369565217391305
2468857,4,B000CPSPYG,"Without conducting a ""Bible Lesson"",1 Thes 4:16-18 states, For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage each other with these words. Why would Paul say encourage each other if it was not Good News..?

How did this come to be called the Rapture anyway? The answer lies in the word translated ""shall be caught up"" (Greek). In Latin, the word is rapere, from which we get ""rapture"". Simply put it means ""to be caught up,"" ""snatched,"" or ""seized.""

As far as the movie, yep, it is old, and there are some parts that are not ""right on"". However, the whole point of the movie is to get your attention. Whether or not you believe, well that's up to you. As far as the movie, I liked it. Go ahead, watch it, and make your own decision..

""It's OK to agree.. to disagree.."" :)",1245369600,21,1087,4.241545893719807
2468858,1,B000CPSPYG,"over the years these movies have been ignorantly used over and over as a tool of evil. there, i said it.

and YES, i absolutely am a christian.

fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.

the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman->
most importantly, THE RAPTURE IS NOT BIBLICAL !!!!!!

this is a weird fear based agenda that has no place in the kingdom.",1236816000,6,443,4.057471264367816
2468859,5,B000CPSPYG,"A must see for people that are too busy loving their life to think about Jesus.

In this movie, one minute they are loving their great life, the next...millions of people have vanished and life has changed in a bad controlling way for the remaining.

Here's a clip: [...]",1205193600,14,271,4.510204081632653
2468860,5,B000CPSPYG,"I watched these on VHS back in the day, and they are my all-time favorite depiciton of the end times as set forth in the book of Revelation. Of course, like most church communities, the makers of this series has the ""rapture"" (a word not used in the Bible) occurring before the tribulation begins, while the book of Revelation says it happens after most of the tribulation and immediately before God's wrath is poured out on the earth. Either way, the things shown going on in the world in this series are quite true to the Bible.

I would recommend these for churches and families alike.",1386633600,2,588,4.547169811320755
2468861,5,B000CPSPYG,"As one viewer on here states yes I am a christian then goes on to slam these prophetic films as falsehoods has got to be one of those christians the Holy Bible describes as ""having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof. You just can not be a christian and the twist the words in the bible to make it appear to mean something else. What you have to do is study to show thy self knowledgable in the word of God and by living as Jesus Christ showed us how. All 4 movies are done very well for the time in which they were conceived from the holy bible. They were designed as a thought provoking tool. They tend to make you stop and take stock of your life and what you can do to improve upon yourself making sure you are not left behind. THE RAPTURE IS VERY REAL it comes from being snatched or carried away, this will happened when GOD has had enough of the foolishness mankind gets into or does not care about humanity. The end times you shall here of wars and rumors of wars but the end shall not yet be. Friends get yourselves ready.",1383523200,,1047,4.137254901960785
2468862,5,B000CPSPYG,"I like how gave you bases of what's to come.

2468863,5,B000CPSPYG,I remember watching this series at church as a youth.  It's even better as an adult and love sharing it with my kids.,1377561600,,117,4.086956521739131
2468864,5,B000CPSPYG,returns us to the simpler message of the gospel and the dangers of rejecting or stalling our decisions. although we know it may not play out exactly like shown it does show the costs one way and the rewards another,1370822400,,214,4.375
2468865,5,B000CPSPYG,"These 4 movies were made back in the 70's and are very real. The information is very close to God's word and are wonderful teaching tools for young and older adults alike. Prophesy and end time predictions are not always favorite subjects to teach but for many who are looking for some enlightment, they will marvel at the accuracy of these and discuss them for a long time.",1362009600,2,374,4.514705882352941

2468869,5,B000CPSPYG,I watched these movies years ago and used them in my Church for young Christians. I love these movies because it most certainly prepares us for the worse that can happen.,1352246400,,170,4.516129032258065
8100203,5,B000CPSPYG,"An excellent prophetic drama series. I watched this as a teenager back in the 1980s and still love it today. It was made in the '70s so the actors are dressed accordingly, but is a good set of movies based on Bible prophesy.",1520726400,,224,4.232558139534884
8100204,5,B000CPSPYG,If you don't have time to read your Bible and find out what is going to happen in the end times these are great movies to watch to help you understand the Rapture and tribulation.

8100206,4,B000CPSPYG,"Every Christian, and members of other faiths, should watch this quatrain of films.  Created over a 12-year time span, there will be some changes in the cast; but the message and themes running through all four - of eternal salvation through Christ vs eternal damnation without Him - are clear.

I personally felt the first two films to be the strongest and best made, but all four should be watched.",1437523200,,399,4.685714285714286

8100209,5,B000CPSPYG,Thank you so much for sending them to me in a timely manner!  We enjoyed this version of the 70's of the rapture.  Got the point across and brought back memeories of the song! :),1403740800,,178,4.057142857142857
8100210,4,B000CPSPYG,I grew up in the time when these were produced and was glad to get copies of the series @ this time in my life to share with others. They were all good dubs. No gliches.,1394755200,,169,3.7222222222222223
8100211,5,B000CPSPYG,"I watched these as a kid and they were a great compliment to having heard the Word preached. Now that I'm 45 and I am a preacher, they're a great tool for ministry.  Their clothes and style are dated, but the message is timeless!",1393632000,,229,4.204545454545454
8100212,5,B000CPSPYG,"I have owned this series for years now, and there is supposed to be a 5th movie that deals with the Battle Of Armageddon.  This series is older, of course, for wasn't it made sometime in the 60s?  Bear in mind of the time of production, and watch this series.  IT IS A MUST SEE SERIES...

Anyone wanting to get a really good idea of what the book of Revelations talks about, this as good as any to watch to find out.  Once you watch this series, maybe go into the Bible, the book of Revelations, and find out for yourself...what it says....

Who ever is interested in getting them to make the last movie, look at the cover of the DVD case, or at the end of a movie, and find out who to write to them, and ask about the new one:  Battle For/Of Armageddon...or a title similar.  I am impatiently waiting for it to come out.

If you are totally non-believer, you will probably not enjoy this movie, nor believe it either, but watch it anyway.

Of course, the end result is:  it is your choice to believe or not, to buy this series or not.  The decision is always up to you.",1391299200,,1070,4.140776699029126
