6729723,5,B00O9ZSJBO,"Ordinarily I enjoy these tales that allow us to get to know our animal friends a bit better. The only problem I had was mine-the timeline used to introduce us to Velcro, his friends and the scientists studying him was....a little slow.  It is imperative for you to know, that the most important truth to be imparted to the viewer, is that Sloth-like is not pejorative  in any way shape or form.
Sloths are not stupid, lazy, dumb, messy or slobs.  On the contrary, their attributes far exceed this of many humans.  The photography was great!",1427846400,5,540,4.59375
6729724,5,B00O9ZSJBO,"Adorable documentary, and much more educational than expected. It goes into scientific details about these wonderful and bizarre creatures. As an avid sloth lover with every other sloth documentary made, this was a wonderful addition to my video library.",1427068800,9,254,5.538461538461538
6729725,5,B00O9ZSJBO,I ordered this as a gift to my daughter because I loved it so much on TV.  It's a very poignant story about a sloth!!,1426982400,,117,3.68
6729726,3,B00O9ZSJBO,"This was a good nature movie about sloths, very informative.  If you're into sloths, you'll especially enjoy it.  If not, you'll learn more about them.",1422144000,4,151,5.0
6729727,5,B00O9ZSJBO,"Sloths are the only mammal that can turn their heads around completely like an owl. Sloth's digestive track is more like a cow, it takes them a month to digest their food. Sloths are move like primate, their body temperature changes more like a reptile not a mammal. This is a well made documentary. I really had to hold back some tears watching Tinka release Hope into the wild. I hope this documentary will help human species to appreciate planet earth and allow sloths to thrive happily in the wild not as a toy or a pet. Sloths can make an irresistible impression and you can get hooked so the hunger for seeing sloths should be in their natural habitat not in a cage or a structure built by human species. Wish Anna and Tinka a very happy and healthy life. Thanks for all that you do in the wild. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1415318400,16,822,4.379084967320262

8682819,5,B00O9ZSJBO,"I would like to give this 5 stars (yes, I know I did.) but someone stole it out of the mailbox between the time it was delivered and my son got home from work.
It twas a present for out grandson to go along with the plush stuffed sloth we brought him from Costa Rica.",1515196800,,267,3.8727272727272726
