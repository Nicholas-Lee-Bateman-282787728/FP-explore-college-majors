5768350,5,B00D2UMHVA,"this was one of the best shows of all time. should have lasted as long as mash, had same caliber of talent. the story was that powerful.
dana Delaney, today she is drop dead gorgeous, then she was unbelievable. incredible actress

This show made you cry, laugh, think, remember. thank you to all the men and women who served and protected us through the years, we forgot for so long. so many unsung heroes.",1382140800,3,406,4.486486486486487
5768351,5,B00D2UMHVA,"If you have a DVD player with region 2, you too can buy the DVD set from the UK that's not chopped up and redone with ""Crap- Generic"" music. WKRP was also redone with ""elevator"" music and that destroyed that show. I'm glad I read the reviews for WKRP and CHINA BEACH before I wasted my money on cheap knock off's. Sony and Time Life always seem to ask for more money for their products, yet cheapen them up to squeeze every last penny for their big bosses. BUYER BEWARE. it tricks and not treats these days. My question is this : Why can the British people get the good stuff and we get trash?",1382054400,2,593,4.165217391304348
5768352,5,B00D2UMHVA,The series was well moved to DVD.  Pricing was appripoiate for the 3 DVD series.  Video and audio quality are good especially considering the age of the series.  I can recommend.,1382054400,3,178,4.67741935483871
5768353,5,B00D2UMHVA,"I believe China beach is one of the best, if not the best television series on Vietnam ever made. For someone who never were ""in country"" or for any nurses who want a glimpse into what it is like being a nurse so close to the front lines, I think it does a great job.

For someone who was ""in country"" during their tour of duty and wants to see a good program to share with others who were not, this program is done well.

For those of you who were in country and have no desire to dredge up those things you want to forget or have ""adapted"" since then, you may not want to see this series. It is your call.",1381795200,,607,3.926829268292683
5768354,5,B00D2UMHVA,I had not seen this show before and it was just wonderful.  I hope they bring out more seasons soon.,1381449600,2,100,4.0
5768355,5,B00D2UMHVA,"In my humble but accurate opinion, China Beach is the best TV drama of all time.  The stories and acting are packed with emotion.  While never glorifying war (far from it!), China Beach always showed great respect for the men and women who served in Vietnam.  My favorite episode is ""Vets"" where real Vietnam veterans shared their personal experiences -- many of which formed the plot lines for China Beach episodes.  The ""Vets"" episode won an Emmy.

I used to tape the episodes and watch them again several times.  I've waited a long time for the series to finally appear on DVD.

For those of you who have never seen China Beach, you owe it to yourself to at least watch Season 1.  I'll be amazed if you down't get hooked.",1381363200,,724,4.473282442748092
5768356,1,B00D2UMHVA,"My wife and I are hearing impaired and we were both shocked to discover this product has NO captions and NO subtitles whatsoever!!!  How can something be released in today's world without some type of captioning???  Federal laws were passed that specifically require all video releases to have captioning for the hearing impaired and Time Life has bascially thumbed their noses at the laws and deaf people.  My wife has been dreaming about China Beach being realeased on DVD for YEARS, only to find out the release is worthless to her because there is no captioning.
Time Life should be ashamed for ignoring deaf people!",1381276800,23,620,4.885714285714286

5768359,4,B00D2UMHVA,"I didn't start watching ""China Beach"" regularly until Season Two (the 1988-89 season) so over the years, I've never seen all the episodes of Season One. The pilot is stunning.  The photography, the story, the clothes and that tear jerking climax - it sets up the show perfectly and introduces each characters.  The first three episodes of Season One, while enjoyable, are at times a little weak.  Yes, the show is set during the VietNam War but instead of the war being the backdrop, at times it feels like an afterthought.  Instead, we get a lot of intrigue with Cherry's mission to find her brother, KC's black market ventures and McMurphy being wooed by a ""zoomie,"" complete with a really unconvincing jet ride through the clouds. We also get stories about air conditioners, laryngitis and a rather painful scene where the woman are all in a bunker together during an air raid and discuss their first times. (I didn't know they had segregated bunkers when everybody was scrambling for their lives.) Watching these early episodes, (save the pilot) I can see why some of the real-life nurses who served in VietNam were wary of the show.

But luckily, the show gels with the episode ""Waiting for Beckett."" From then on, Season One closes out with some good episodes and the actors really get to know their characters (if you  watch closely, you'll see that Lila never refers to herself as military in Season One; she was retrofitted as brass in Season Two and suddenly her character makes a lot more sense.) It's a great setup for Season Two when John Wells joined the producing team and the show grew much darker- and better.",1378598400,32,1626,4.72791519434629

5768409,5,B00D2UMHVA,"China beach was an amazing tour de force. The Vietnam war brought to life again for  those who fought it and fought against it. Who the heros were , the horror of war and lives  destroyed . Stories of young people dying for what most of the country did not believe in. The soldiers and medical staff trying to save lives while being bombarded with enemy fire . The women who were ignored during those years finally get a voice .

5768539,5,B00D2UMHVA,"I loved this series and watched it all on TV. It aired from 1988-1991. Was pleased to see it had been released on DVD. The shows were excellent  good characters, good writing, and good acting, and a deft mix of drama, action, and quirky humor. The horrors of war and the emotional damage of PTS are relevant today. This is NOT a rehash of Mash. It stands on its own and is unique in that the Vietnam War is primarily seen from the  point of view of the women  nurse, journalist, soldier, officer, and prostitute  doing their best to manage the Army's 510th Evac. Center near the front lines of the war. The base provides triage and emergency surgery for wounded American soldiers flown in from the field, with a parallel operation to entertain soldiers recovering or taking R&R. Both Dana Delany and Marg Helgenberger won Emmys for their roles. My only complaint was that during the last two seasons, the mix of current action with flashbacks or flash forwards, while fleshing out the characters, sometimes became confusing and may have been part of the reason the shows ratings never reflected its quality.",1437264000,4,1107,4.72020725388601

5768675,4,B00D2UMHVA,"I was completely smitten by Dana Delany when I first saw China Beach back in 1988, twenty years after I got wounded in Vietnam. The series played true. Because the scrips were honest and the actors played it straight, which is more than we could ever say about Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon. My experience was mostly with young Navy nurses, who seemed just as angelic as Delany's character. They were the sort of young women we should have married, if we had felt good enough about ourselves to ask.  Missed opportunities.

To say that young soldiers or Marines in Vietnam all became drunks or potheads is not true. We had a pot problem in the Marine Corps, but the Army won that contest mostly thanks to an undisciplined officer corps. It was ludicrous. But we all had our problems and somehow I think most of us believed that the love of a good woman -- like Nurse Colleen McMurphy -- could really cure us, could get us over this s***y war and the s***y wounded and the s***y dying and the truly dead.

McMurphy was the all-American girl were dreamed about. For awhile anyhow.

I went through three marriages and finally got sober at 44.  Slow Irishman.  By then, McMurphy had moved on to Desperate Housewives  and was no longer the girl we wanted to marry, but the one, or more, we did marry.

For a long time, I wanted to get a videotape or DVD of this series, and finally, after 25 years, they are there on Amazon. So I clicked without reading the blurb, which did not say the discs had closed captions, because they don't. Bottom line: if you've lost as much of your hearing as I have, they might as well be dubbed in Mongolian. Hence the 4 stars.  What a shame.",1417651200,3,1670,4.413680781758957

With stories of the ugly extremities of the Vietnam War interspersed with the survival tool of humor, this series is at the top of my all-time favorite TV shows.  Superb acting and story lines that often cause a range of emotions from anger to humorous.  There is a beautiful Vietnam Women's Memorial bronze statue in Washington, DC and whenever I visit there and see it, I think of China Beach.  Likewise, when I watch China Beach, I am reminded of that statue and who it honors.

5768748,5,B00D2UMHVA,"A POWERFUL SERIES. CHINA BEACH is all about Hearts and Minds. The TRAGEDY OF WAR and how each person copes with it is the principle theme. DANA DELANEY is the HEART OF THE SHOW and will steal YOUR heart as the GORGEOUS and CHARMING lead character nurse Lt Colleen McMurphy. THE NAM gives you a lot to think about. Marg Helgenberger is young and a far cry from Catherine Willows. She's the camp's Recreational Equipment. A cold hard businesswoman, but if you dig deep enough you just might find she has a heart. There's also a young girl named CHERRY, just out of high school from IOWA who volunteers as a Donut-Dolly, helping the wounded by taking their minds off their pain. She's a natural breath of fresh air to everyone in that terrible place. She's mainly looking for her brother who's somewhere IN THE BUSH. Then there's the Graves Registration guy played by Michael Boatman. He barely looks 18 but he shows commendable respect and care in processing the dead. GI's pass through, each leaving his own story. The staff at the China Beach Medivac Hospital are a family to these brave men and to each other. A POWERFUL, MOVING SHOW. I first saw all this TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO and I have NEVER FORGOTTEN IT. I don't want to be a Spoiler but there are some moments that stay with you forever. This isn't MASH. It's SERIOUS.

This was a very well done series with memorable characters and probably the best musical score of any TV show from that era because the show featured the popular music of that era in every episode.

5768801,5,B00D2UMHVA,"I was beginning to wonder if this series would ever be released on DVD. I've never been a dedicated television watcher, so back in the day I caught the occasional episode when I happened to be at home when it was on, but it made an impression on me. I still don't watch television, but I do watch great television on DVD--Nero Wolfe, Firefly, Inspector Morse--so I was delighted when China Beach Season 1 was finally released on DVD. I was also nervous--would it be as good as I remembered?

The good news is, tt's better than I remember, and my husband thought it was great too.. I can't afford to cough up the astronomical price for the entire collection in one go, so I am getting one season at a time. We have just finished Season 2 and have pre-ordered Season 3, due for release on May 7. We haven't watched any of the extras yet--we want to avoid spoilers.

The writing, the acting, and the character development are all first-rate. And the music...well, as much as I hated waiting this long, it was worth it for the music licensing to get worked out.

This series is just excellent in every way. Highly recommended.",1395100800,,1122,4.463414634146342

5768817,5,B00D2UMHVA,"This was one of our favorite TV shows when it first ran.  We have enjoyed watching it again!

Season One has the two hour pilot as well as the original Season One programs... and all the original music is on the DVDs.  Without the music, it would not have been nearly as enjoyable to watch the programs again.",1394064000,,309,4.293103448275862

I have friends who were Vietnam nurses. I decided to watch this series on DVD, and I am pretty impressed by this series. It brought back a lot of memories for me. I loved the characters, and the stories are very well written. I can also relate to it as a nurse working trauma in a big city. This isn't a one dimensional portrayal of war or what it is like to be a nurse or work in extreme and terrible situations. It's got a lot of layers to it. It's the best medical show I've seen so far. I plowed through each episode one after another, and I found it to be very engaging and very entertaining.",1394064000,4,758,4.06

5768820,5,B00D2UMHVA,I did not see the original show on tv so was excited that it came out on dvd.  I am a babyboomer and lived in the times of the Vietnam War so this show brought alot of memories back as well as different view of the war.  I simply could not stop watching it and highly recommend it!,1393459200,,281,3.8275862068965516
5768821,3,B00D2UMHVA,"Wow, It's been over twenty five years since the pilot of this intelligent, beautiful moving series was shot. It's been a long wait for a DVD release of this superb series. I give the series four stars and this release two and a half stars, which Amazon does not  allow so i went up to three stars as two stars would have been overly harsh.

Unfortunately, while this DVD release is packed with very welcome extras included cast and crew interviews and commentaries. The audio and video presentation leaves a lot to be desired, especially when comparing this release to Shout Factory's recent release of another great late eighties series, Thirtysomething.
The picture quality in the Thirtysomething release is revelatory. Which is to be expected when the release producers went back and scanned the original 35mm film elements at 2K (2048x1080) HD. If it is not obvious in viewing the pilot that the masters used for this release of China beach are in fact the old NTSC broadcast masters, the video overlay stating that the programme is presented in stereo (Ironically, this DVD is a dual mono release) that appears on subsequent episodes gives the game away. Muddy images with shifting contrast between shots and a surprising amount of scratching is an unusual thing to see with a U.S, series. Particularly when the show is not that old. Check  out the excellent  DVD and Blu-ray release of The Twilight Zone, a programme thirty years older then China Beach. U.S. commercial film and television is usually technically brilliant. Regardless of a programme's other qualities the audio and video presentation is rarely anything less then superb.

China Beach was produced at Warner Brothers and I assume they still retain the show's original elements. I realise that a video release has a budget that it must work within. I would like to have my cake and eat it to, but I would gladly do without the extras if it meant we got new 2K scans of every episode and touch wood all the original songs intact. I can see that a lot of work has gone into this release, over 250 songs cleared, only 17 tracks over four seasons had to be replaced  Considering That I paid less then twenty dollars each for this and the second season I do not mean to be a grouch and I am grateful that the series has gotten a home video release. Given the diappointing quality, I cannot recommend the overpriced box set.  I hope seasons three and four get a separate release.",1393286400,14,2444,4.709601873536299

5768833,5,B00D2UMHVA,"Enjoyed Season 1.  I didn't see it when it was on TV because I had just returned from Vietnam.  I can believe some of the show, having seen a helo come in with wounded soldiers for medical care.  In the support areas, there was at time some light-hearted fun and some of the entertainment, provided with a simple stage was true to life.  One thing that is clear - the nurses in particular were true heros and sure didn't get much credit for what they went through.  I have read several books on what nurses experienced in Vietnam and it brought me to tears.  May God truly give them comfort as they provided comfort to so many soldiers in Vietnam.",1392681600,,647,4.35
5768834,5,B00D2UMHVA,"I always loved the series.  After signing online petitions to get it on DVD, you can imagine my surprise and delight to FINALLY find it released! I long suspected that it was a music licensing issue that kept it locked in the vaults, but I  happy that the original Motown, etc. songs are intact, even showcased in the nice booklet that accompanies the set.
The story is so well presented and superbly acted that I practically time travel reliving the episodes! My only wish would be that it was released on bluray as well.",1392422400,,522,4.542553191489362

5768836,5,B00D2UMHVA,"This is mostly a show about the women and medical staff in Vietnam. Each show is an accurate account of the nurses, red cross girls, doctors and USO performers who were there. Its their stories put on the tube. There will be blood, alcoholism, racial strife, poor living and working conditions these people had to deal with every day and is based on the R&R and medical center at Da Nang AFB in Vietnam.
Nearly every show will make you cry and every show will have some incredible performance turned in by one or more of the actors,
its the best overall acting by a cast I have ever seen.
If you have seen enough fire fight documentaries and want to see what not so normal everyday life was really like for these people this is a very accurate account of how things really were.",1391904000,,778,4.372413793103449

5768843,5,B00D2UMHVA,"China Beach was a ground breaking series.  It depicted a truthful picture of the Vietnam experience without concentrating solely on the carnage and it told the story largely from the perspective of the nurses who probably saw far more blood and gore than those of us who ""humped the bush"".  It is a wonderfully done show that focuses more on the bond that people of diverse backgrounds develop under the harsh conditions of war.  For myself.....I identified heavily with the character Dodger.  That was me forty odd years ago so.....for me.....the show is therapeutic as well as entertaining.  You can't go wrong adding this to your collection.",1391040000,,644,4.981308411214953

Last week he went to put in the last disk and discovered it was cracked and unplayable. Now when I try to exchange it, they say it is beyond the return date. This was bought in October as a Christmas gift for my husband, a veteran, hence his love of the show, so of course it was past two months, I purchased it on October 26!

its particular look at the  women who participated in that war and the attitudes and values of that time, and the great acting by all
of the cast members. This was a show that has long deserved to be issued on DVD. Was it worth the wait? Yes, for all the reasons
mentioned. Then why only three stars?. Well, after so many years of waiting for the DVD release, fans of the
show deserved better. The picture quality is so-so, with some scenes so dark they're hard to watch. And the lack of captions is
a real drawback for a show that depends on literate, somber, soft-spoken dialogue. For all the years this show's followers have
anticipated the DVD release, a better job could have been done. Don't miss this show by any means, but be prepared for the
drawbacks of the DVD set.",1390176000,29,905,4.4787878787878785

Unique ,because it is Vietnam seen through the eyes of the women who went and served there. I watched the show when it was on TV,and I am going to buy the DVDS and watch it again. Why? Because from the opening song to the end credits,you are instantly transported back in time, to a place that a lot of people don't understand,and a lot of people are forgetting about. If you are one of those folks, or you just want to watch a very good TV show, I highly recommend this, Why am I so sure of all this? I served there. .",1387929600,,662,4.1796875

5768881,5,B00D2UMHVA,"When I first arrived at Desert, a friend and I looked at the showers and exclaimed ""China Beach!""  When I came back, the show had been canceled and was in rerun.  I devoured the reruns, because there wasn't anything at all for women veterans, and the show really spoke to me in ways I didn't understand.

In watching in on DVD now, the first thing that strikes me is that the producers respected and honored the women characters.  I sat through the opening credits and counted the number of women in the cast.  Most TV series today seem to add a woman character to please the network, and it feels like that in how the character is treated.  But China Beach made each character important, no matter the gender.  I think one of the things that I didn't understand at the time was that it did show how the war changed these characters, and sometimes in not so good ways, which was my war, too.  But it didn't make statements about it; it let the characters show it, and sometimes in very subtle ways.  Good cast, and good writers who wanted to do good things.",1385510400,5,1057,4.37948717948718

5768916,5,B00D2UMHVA,"I used to watch this series when it premiered on ABC years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed the stories that were told and the actors did a good job of portraying them.  This is the first thing that I ever saw Dana Delaney in, and I have liked her ever since.",1383782400,,253,4.04
5768917,5,B00D2UMHVA,Brought back good memories of the series. I enjoyed the actors & their roles again. It was also fun to see some actors I forgot about too.,1383696000,,138,4.148148148148148
5768918,4,B00D2UMHVA,"China Beach was a Critically acclaimed series that ran from April 1988 to July 1991. Finally after a 25 years wait and hundreds of requests from fans, it's available on DVD in 2013!

China Beach was one of my most favorite shows back in the day. It has been so long that I didn't realize that Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, was the same actress as the very Hot Redhead, Karen Charlene ""K.C."" Koloski, a heroin-addicted prostitute and later black-marketeer that I had a crush on as a teen. Also didn't realize that Dana Delany who played Katherine Mayfair on the Desperate Housewives and played Megan Hunt on the ABC drama series Body of Proof was the same actress as China Beach's Nurse Colleen McMurphy. They both looked different with red hair in China Beach (Nowadays Blond). Also surprised to see Robert Picardo,  the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH), ""The Doctor"", on Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and some Star Trek movies and played Richard Woolsey in the Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe was the same actor as Dr. Dick Richards on China Beach (who had hair back than).

Only complaint, as someone mentioned earlier, with No Sub-Titles nor Closed-Captions which my wife needs (she's not deaf) just unable to comprehend actors talking in an accent whether it's a Texas, Southern, Mid-Western, Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Boston, Scottish, Cockney, Irish, Aussie, Hispanic, Hip-Hop/Ghetto Talk, Cajun nor French-Canadian. She really needs English Subs (so do I sometimes) which especially should be available since we're paying up the yin-yang on these DVD sets. Seems like the more expensive the DVD and BD Sets are missing Subs and CC whereas the cheap TV DVD sets have Subs or CC..",1383696000,19,1780,5.006756756756757

5768920,5,B00D2UMHVA,"After waiting for so long I was thrilled to see McMurphy, Dodger, Boonie and all the others again.  China Beach was one of the best ensemble casts on television.  I do wish the full set was not ridiculously expensive.",1383696000,,217,4.538461538461538
5768921,5,B00D2UMHVA,"It was always a wonderful series.  I've wanted to see it again for a long time.  The episodes are just as I remember them.  They are very interesting.  They are emotional and heart-wrenching.  My husband was in Viet Nam for 13 months.  He never watched the series the first time around.  He watched all these episodes for the first season with me.  He talked about the feelings that were renewed in him. He spoke of the truthfulness of the shows.  It's been a good experience for him, I think.  We look forward to the remaining seasons when they are available.  It's a pity we don't have many series today as great as China Beach was!!",1383609600,,635,4.434782608695652

5768933,5,B00D2UMHVA,"China Beach was 1 of the BEST shows ever on TV! So glad Star Vista released Season 1. I inquired, & unfortunately at present, they have no plans to release the other indiv seasons. All we can do is hope they decide to release the others soon. Intense drama, humor, action, this show has it all. It was so great to finally watch these episodes again & if you weren't around when this show originally aired, know this: whether you are male or female, each episode in this show will draw you in simply by the depth of the characters & the bonds between them. Talk about people in a sm group being tight; first rate show all the way! PS: the Extras DVD is fabulous! Not only do they have cast reunions, but the 2 interviews w/ Dana [McMurphy] & Chloe [Lorette] are not only lengthy, but they are 1st rate! I hung on every word each of them had to say. Actually, these 2 interviews are as good as an episode of the show. Usually Extras DVDs have little substance; not so w/ this one. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the Extras DVD.",1383523200,,1031,4.26530612244898

5768939,5,B00D2UMHVA,"I've scouted the internet literally for years waiting for someone to release this but had heard that because of rights' issues associated with the huge abundance of music on the show, that that issue was probably never going to be able to be resolved. Their series soundtrack contains hundreds of songs, so it was a pretty believable issue. But now, somehow, they've done it! I haven't even broken the wrapper on this set. I don't care if freshmen students from the Ridiculous University's School of Film and Animal Husbandry , or even cannibals put this together using masking tape or human sinew. All I know is that this series is that good and I am beyond thrilled to have it waiting for me for a snowy weekend.",1382659200,,714,4.6299212598425195
5768940,4,B00D2UMHVA,"As my father spent some of his military career in Vietnam, I began watching China Beach back in 1988, looking to get some impression of what life could have been like there.  Set in 1967 at a hospital in Da Nang, China Beach turned out to be an engaging and  moving drama, with an extremely talented and mostly youthful cast, that included Dana Delany (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-of-Proof/dp/B003UD7J26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body of Proof</a>), Marg Helgenberger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI/dp/B00008972G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI</a>), Michael Boatman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spin-City/dp/B001D2WUDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spin City</a>), Robert Picardo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Voyager/dp/B000127LW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Voyager</a>), Concetta Tomei, Nan Woods, Ricki Lake (The Ricki Lake Show), and Jeff Korber.  Dealing with war, death, medicine, romance, morality, and survival, the stories were often thoughtful, and emotional charged, as after so many years, it seemed that American television was prepared to feature the Vietnam conflict in prime time, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tour-of-Duty/dp/B0001Z3I12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tour of Duty</a>&nbsp;had premiered a year before.

In 2013, roughly coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the premiere of China Beach (1988-91), Time Life released the entire series in a 21 disc collector's set, which contains the series' pilot, 62 one hour episodes produced in four seasons, and a prodigious amount of bonus materials.  The set is currently available at the Time Life website for about $200.  What appears to be the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/same-set/dp/B00005JMSD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">same set</a>, is now available through Amazon, but is selling for close to $330.  That's quite a hefty premium!

By comparison, the 3 disc Season One set is a relative bargain, as it sells for about $30 at Time Life.  The set contains the two hour China Beach pilot, plus six one hour episodes.  According to Time Life, there are some 3 hours of bonus materials, most of which is probably the commentary track on the pilot.

Blessed with superior writing and an outstanding cast, China Beach is a series often capable of touching the heart, and sometimes breaking it, so you might want to keep some tissues nearby.  Nominated four times, Dana Delany won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series twice.  Marg Helgenberger also won an Emmy, for her portrayal of a prostitute.  Nan Woods, whose acting career apparently ended with China Beach, gives a moving performance as a Red Cross volunteer.  The series also features some great guest stars, including Nancy Sinatra, who plays herself visiting the troops, in the final episode of Season One.

Popular music was in integral part of China Beach, with The Supremes ""Reflections"" serving as a poignant theme song.  The inability to secure licensing rights for music, has been an issue with the DVD release of some TV programs, but thankfully that is not the case with China Beach, as apparently rights for all the music originally featured in the program, some 300 songs, were secured.  So the presentation of the episodes, is quite close to their original form.

After being forgotten by many, sentiment toward the Vietnam war turned in a positive direction by the 1980's, which saw the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (The Wall).  The time was right for a program like China Beach.  Twenty five years may have passed since it debuted, but with American troops still being deployed in foreign lands, the subject matter dealt with in China Beach, still has some relevance today.

Other complete series sets originally released by Time Life, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart/dp/B001E0O8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-From-U-N-C-L-E/dp/B00005JM5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</a>, eventually came down in price, after retailers like Amazon, were permitted to sell them.  Hopefully that also occurs with China Beach, because the current premium price for the entire series, just does not seem reasonable.",1382227200,,4544,6.462046204620462
