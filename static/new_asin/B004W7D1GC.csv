8444579,3,B004W7D1GC,"This DVD contains 30 licks in the style of Paul Gilbert arranged into a complete instrumental tune.  The licks contain many examples of string skipping and sequencing, for which Paul is known.

The good elements of this DVD are that the overall tune and individual licks are nice and very well played.
However there are a number of problems prospective buyer should be aware of:

1) No written TAB or music notation, either on-screen or in PDF format
2) Backing track has no chart and is only playable via DVD (no separate audio file)
3) Several licks utilize uppermost frets of 24-fret guitar - unplayable on a 21 or 22 fret guitar

For me item (1), no TAB, is inexcusable in a new DVD costing around $20.  Although spoken format of string letter and fret number may seem like a private lesson, it is very frustrating and time consuming having to rewind and forward DVD to get everything correct.  I spent several hours writing out TAB on 6 pages, for future reference.
Problem of no TAB seems to be endemic with Lick Library, there should be no big deal of getting someone to transcribe this and use software package to write it down, even if artist does not compose in that way.

Most music consists of harmony (chords) and melody, not having a chart of backing track means you have to try and work out for yourself why a particular lick is played over a particular chord.

Although Paul Gilbert PGM model has 24 frets, not all his guitars, like Fireman, do and I am betting many guitar players and prospective buyers of DVD do not own a 24-fret guitar.

Hope this review is of some use to prospective buyers and maybe Lick Library.",1334448000,3,1635,4.534013605442177
