I highly prize this film!",1394064000,,400,4.1688311688311686
8144904,3,B0001A79A8,"In LA TRUITE Isabelle Huppert plays a cold-blooded trout of a woman, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique, supportedby Jeanne Moreau as a wife whose husband, Rambert (Jean-Pierre Cassel), throws himself (repeatedly) at Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique, who is married to a gay husband (Jacques Spiesser) agrees to accompany Saint-Genis (Daniel Olbrychski) to Tokyo, as much to annoy Rambert as to torment Saint-Genis.  The film has many luscious sequences in Tokyo and France, and Huppert acts most of the other protagonists off the screen in a difficult role.  There are flashbacks of her learning how her father and his friends used women, which increases her resolve not to be abused in similar fashion.  She comes across as outwardly unsympathetic, but we understand her motives in a world where rich people treat those around them with the same lack of concern as they do their possessions. Rambert is even less sympathetic and less capable of love than Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique. In this slow-moving narrative style definitely assumes more significance than content, but the film does have a particularly satisfactory ending.",1392595200,,1136,5.670588235294118
8144905,5,B0001A79A8,"Oh, boy, Isabelle Huppert is every bit the woman Eve was in Losey's greatest films. She is strong, independent, irresistable, but completely in charge of the weak men she destroys. She is more of a shark than a trout and I would not like to know her. Compelling viewing, but I reckon ""Eve"" remains his masterpiece.",1357776000,3,314,4.625
