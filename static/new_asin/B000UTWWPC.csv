8214780,5,B000UTWWPC,"A MUST SEE for all LDS members, especially if you Just love President Hinckley.  This is a celebration of his 95th birthday,  and all the entertainers who came out to sing to him just can't be beat. Plus you get the best seat In  the whole house!!! President Gordon Botner Hinckley was born in 1910, served a 2 year mission in England, built more Temples than all other Prophets combined, and sadly, he passed away in 1998. He will be forever missed by all who knew him!",1404777600,,470,4.379310344827586
