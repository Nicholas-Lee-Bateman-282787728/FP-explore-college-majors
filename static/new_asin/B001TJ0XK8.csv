8341640,1,B001TJ0XK8,"Unfortunately the content of the package was not what i was led to believe. I received an advertising DVD rather than the DSS's DVD, most disappointing.",1359244800,4,152,4.884615384615385
8341641,1,B001TJ0XK8,Just read what everyone else wrote and you'll know what I mean.  NOTHING about the Dead Sea Scrolls!  Just an advertising dvd!  Rubbish!,1356739200,3,136,4.826086956521739
8341642,1,B001TJ0XK8,"This is not a real DVD on the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Amazon should remove this title altogether.  When you get it, it is a promo that asks you to buy the real thing.  Amazon, don't sell this DVD!",1329177600,5,191,3.973684210526316
8341643,1,B001TJ0XK8,What I received was the same promotional mailer that I had received a copy of myself. It was not the full-length DVD I expected. This was an introduction piece originally sent out to promote their full-length DVDs about Ancient Civilizations. The first of the Ancient Mysteries Series was The Dead Sea Scrolls.  This was just an introductory mailer like the one I received.  The person selling this should be ashamed of trying to make money on another company's advertising product.  Bad Business!,1315094400,4,497,5.036585365853658
8341644,1,B001TJ0XK8,"Just wanted to inform others to beware and stay away from this misleading and deceptive dvd ad, when I received the dvd little did I know that the dvd was only a very short promotion presentation for a subscription to a more costly set of dvd's.

After you receive the 1st dvd you will then receive a different dvd each month, there are 10 different dvd's in this set, costing $18.95 plus s&h charge. Total cost would be around $22.00 for each dvd.

When it is all said and done you will wind up paying around $220.00 for the complete set, when you really only wanted to buy just one dvd about the Dead Sea Scrolls.

What nerve they have.",1294358400,9,638,4.3
8341645,1,B001TJ0XK8,NO WHERE ON THIS AMAZON AD DOES IT TELL YOU DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER YOU'LL BE CHARGED FULL PRICE FOR A THREE AD VIDEO. CANT BELIEVE AMAZON LETS PEOPLE LIKE THIS DO BUSSINESS ON THERE SITE!!!!,1287705600,7,193,4.243243243243243
8341646,1,B001TJ0XK8,"Don't be fooled by the packaging - this is only a 3-minute PROMOTION for a DVD series. They'll send you the REAL ""Dead Sea Scrolls - IF you sign up for the one video-per-month series. Nowhere on the outer packaging does it tell you the DVD you were expecting isn't inside.",1285977600,11,272,4.352941176470588
8341647,2,B001TJ0XK8,"We were very disappointed with this DVD we purchased.
The Dead Sea Scrolls video is not really the full length 50 minute documentary
we were expecting to get....it was a 5 minute PREVIEW to the documentary.
We had the preview DVD already and was thinking we were buying the full length
documentary.  We had to look several other places to find an actual documentary about the
Dead Sea Scrolls.",1285545600,6,393,4.695652173913044
8341648,1,B001TJ0XK8,"Somebody tell me if I am BLIND.  No where could I find that this DVD was just a sales promotion to subscribe the whole set, or something.  Did not appreciate paying 5.48 for an ad!!!",1273881600,15,182,4.171428571428572
