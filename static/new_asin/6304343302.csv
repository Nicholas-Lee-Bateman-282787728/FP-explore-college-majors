8188744,4,6304343302,"This music video is about 20 minutes long has 3 music videos, and has interviews of the band. The three music videos, ""Roots Bloody Roots"", ""Ratamahatta"", and ""Attitude"", are very creative videos. The ""Roots Bloody Roots"" music video is kind of lame. The ""Ratamahatta"" music video however is an unbelievable entirely clay video! ""Attitude"" is another great video that has the Ultimate Fighting Championship in it. These three videos are pretty good, but it's short length and the fact that these songs aren't Sepultura's best that I can't give this album a full five stars.",1002931200,,573,5.042105263157895
