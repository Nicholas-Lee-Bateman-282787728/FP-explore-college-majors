4285283,3,B0047HXMPM,"I have several of Trudie Styler's workout DVD's.  I enjoy each of them very much and can contend with the introduction portion of her other ones -- as fast forwarding is blocked during this time, unable to skip directly to the start of the practice.  I cannot contend with the length of the introduction in her ""Weight Loss Yoga"".  I work out twice daily with DVD's and this one is most annoying due to the excessive length of time taken to promote her other DVD's before getting to the actual workout.  I have to plan around this portion, by putting her DVD in to play while I leave the room to do something else until the program begins.  Frustrating to say the least.  If I'm in a hurry on a particular day and need to just get right to a quick workout, I have to choose another practioners DVD over Ms. Styler's because of this waste of time.  Does anyone know how to skip over these annoying introductions ???",1301011200,82,914,4.372781065088757

I was able to get this at Target a few years ago and found it by chance. But again, can no longer find it in a local store.

4285288,2,B0047HXMPM,"To be honest, I am really not impressed with this DVD. I prefer the Yoga of Rodney Yee, but this one is okay. I half enjoy the Pilate for abs, but that's about it. I really do not use this workout DVD, it just isn't what I had hoped it would be. I bought it at a great priced and it was shipped very quickly, but it's not my cup o'tea. I will most likely donate this DVD or give it to a family member that is interested in learning Yoga.
The Yoga possess are not advanced, anyone can do these poses. Rodney Yee always has a relaxation portion at the end, these guys do not do that. Well, they either have you breath deeply in down dog, or standing up in prayer poss. Overall, it just wasn't for me. Good day. One more thing, I'm not sure why it is called ""Trudie Styler's"", she really only works out alongside her instructor.",1440806400,4,825,4.098765432098766

4285297,5,B0047HXMPM,"Rather new to Yoga and severely out of shape, I've been failing at every Yoga video I've tried, as they are too hard on my joints and muscles.  This video is different in that it offers a chair Yoga version for those who are not very flexible or who are completely new at this.  YAY!  It is gentle, flowing, easy to follow and makes me feel WONDERFUL.  My body is waking up, feeling flexible again.  I need to lose about 50 lbs. and have been eating very healthy for a long time.  But without exercise, weight loss after menopause is difficult.  This video is leading me gently into being able to do Yoga.  I'm confident that with consistent use, I will ""graduate"" from the chair to regular beginner's yoga, and on from there.  Thank you, Trudie and Jose, for creating this wonderful, thoughtful chair workout for people like me.",1415404800,7,829,4.510067114093959
4285298,5,B0047HXMPM,"I got this DVD and I just love it. It's my favorite one that I have. I give it 5 stars because you really really work out all your muscles.  And you have the choice to do 4 different work outs and 1 downloadable. I like the calming voice James Silva has throughout all the workouts. It's not a rush rush workout, you go through the motions like vinyasa  yoga but you're using a lot of muscles and... you loose weight just like it says. I've lost weight and I am not heavy at all, but I can tell by my clothes. So glad I got this DVD I just love Trudie Styler so much. Need more of her. The 15 minute meditation is just an added bonus as well. LOVE IT, LOVE IT",1407542400,5,659,3.91044776119403

The chair yoga is for those who are just beginning.  The workouts are challenging without being exhausting.

I did not mind that the instructor talked all through the poses or positions. I found it helpful because it truly helped me be more conscious of my breathing and helped me relax more into the position.

4285309,4,B0047HXMPM,"As a beginner to yoga and having been sedintary at my job and lifestyle for years, I find the ""chair yoga"" on this video to be just what I needed to get started.  It is not as easy as you might think, yet it is very manageable and a good start to get me motivated while giving me a challenging workout.  My husband is retired and has started doing the workout with me on a daily basis.  We've been at it daily for 3 weeks now and are ready to move on to the total body workout.  We've viewed the total body workout and it appears many of the moves and instruction will flow nicely after learning them in the chair video.  We enjoy James' narration and find his step by step instruction easy to follow.  We look forward to beginning the more challenging set now and will definitely purchase Trudie's videos in the future.  Thanks for a great product!",1364342400,,849,4.26875

I did a little reaserch and found this DVD.....It said that it was for the beginner so I bought it. When I got home there was even a bigger surprise......There's a section called ""Chair Yoga"" which means exactly that......No getting off of the chair but STILL getting all the basic streching to get the day started. It has 3-4 more sections that lead you into the more advanced moves.
Bottom line is I love this DVD and would reccommend for anyone.....young or old who is looking for a way to start Yoga.
Thank you Trudi Styler for getting me started in the new year:)",1357084800,,715,4.383458646616542
4285316,5,B0047HXMPM,"Haven't had the time to really get into this yet, but am excited about it.  I found the workouts to be just that--Workouts.  Not just regular yoga where ""holding the pose"" is the thing to do.  This one uses the poses to gently do a workout that works up a sweat and burns calories.  James d'Silva's voice is excellent for this DVD, and I found myself unconsciously doing the breathing as he was vocally working through the routines.  As with any program or video, you take what you can use, or what works for you, and let the rest go.  I received the DVD quickly and in excellent condition.  Very pleased with the purchase.",1356912000,,623,4.412280701754386
4285317,3,B0047HXMPM,"I like this Yoga DVD.  I often do Total Body flow after a run - it's a nice stretch for back, hamstrings & hip flexors, then I add on glutes & IT band and a final twist of my own and I'm done.  I also like the short AM practice in the bonus section - I frequently do this one before I do one of my more challenging yoga DVD's first thing in the morning when I roll out of bed.  Here's why I docked two stars: one is for the title - I don't think anyone will loose one ounce doing this... and the other is for the error in the Total Body section.  It was hard to pick up because of changing camera angles and the fact that the video is choreographed like this:  flow A - left side, flow B - right side, flow A - right side, flow B - left side, (you're not doing one flow on one side, then immediately doing the same flow on the other side). So... I sat there with pen & paper one day & tracked the flows & sides.  The error is at 18:00 - when he says ""move your left foot forward"" - ignore him and move your RIGHT foot forward - then you'll be even.",1339372800,13,1048,3.7844036697247705
4285318,3,B0047HXMPM,"I think that when we hear ""for weight loss"" we all tend to assume that it for weight loss for the obese. This video is not for the morbidly obese individual who has been sedentary for years. At one time I exercised at least 6 days a week and that included yoga. I am ashamed to say that I am about 60 pounds heavier now than I was then and a total of about 80 pounds overweight. In the past year I've gone back to work and become very sedentary so I am, sadly, quite out of shape. To put ""out of shape"" in perspective, I can walk up and down stairs and I can walk a mile but I could not run a mile and my knees hurt and my weight definitely makes getting up and down from the floor harder. My core is very weak and I have poor endurance.

That being said, the Yoga for Weight Loss portion (18 minutes) was not too challenging but it was very hard to follow. The instructor (Trudie does not instruct this video, she is just in it) moves very quickly from one pose to the other and does not name the pose. For example, he does not say ""transition to warrior..."" I would highly recommend watching the video first so you're familiar with where the poses are going next. If you're unable to move quickly through the poses, this segment is very difficult to keep up with. If you are seriously overweight or have been sedentary this portion is not going to be for you. If you're new to yoga and do not know the poses, this segment would also be very difficult. If you happen to fall into that category, I would recommend starting with Suzanne Deason instead. She is much easier to follow and shows modifications for every level. This video shows no modifications.

Frustrated with the 18-minute segment and wanting to at least get a good stretch in, I moved to the Chair Yoga portion. I was quite surprised by this segment because I thought this would be very very easy, and in some respects it was, but it was also not as easy as I expected in others. You use the chair as a tool to get comfortable with some of the poses and for support as you build your body back up. You'll also be lifting out of it quite a bit and that was perfect for me as I recondition my core. If you've been sedentary, this segment is really excellent. He never says ""abs"" or ""core"" but quite a few of the movements do work your core quite well. Again, that is if your core is weak though. If you have a lot of weight to lose and have been sedentary, this Chair Yoga segment might be right for you. On the other hand, nothing is going to prepare you for downward dog other than doing downward dog and increasing your upper body endurance. You have to remember that if you can only hold it for 4 seconds at first then that is right where you start and build on that.

If you're very overweight, new to yoga, or have been more sedentary, I would recommend Suzanne Deason's Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss instead of this. You'll get more use out of that one. If you're already familiar with yoga, have gotten out of shape, and need a way to ease back in, the Chair Yoga segment is surprisingly good. Yoga Conditioning (the first segment) will be great for you if you watch it first, know the poses, and are able to move quickly through the poses.

My plan is to do the Chair Yoga daily for a week and then move to Susanne Deason or Baron Baptiste videos that I've done before. This is a nice way for me to get started.

Namaste.",1333238400,27,3398,4.213517665130568
4285319,5,B0047HXMPM,Trudie makes yoga an enjoyable and wothwhile learning experience.  I never realized how great I would feel after learning a few positions.  It was definitely a great purchase on my end.,1331942400,,185,4.935483870967742
4285320,4,B0047HXMPM,"This is the second DVD I purchased with Trudie Styler and James Desilva. I would highly recommend this DVD. James Desilva is an excellent teacher. He's focused, precise, and controlled. You absolutely get a great workout. The DVD's intro seems long and pointless; I'd rather get right to the work out and not have to fast forward through the intro. That's a personal preference.",1331856000,,378,4.921875

Rather than alternating left/right lunges, the instructor ends up asking you to do 3 left lunges (not 2 left and 2 right).  the instructions that follow the mistake are correct as far as the which leg and arm should be where.  It's not so bad, I was just surprised because Gaiam is notorious and Mr. D'Silva is a very famous instructor.",1328313600,5,395,4.458333333333333

4285324,4,B0047HXMPM,"I find this dvd to be just what I am looking for on most days when I am home and have some time to do yoga. Both the 24 minutes sequence, and the 18 minute sequence, both provide a GOOD accurate work out. I feell like a did a good yoga routine when I am complete. Though they are missing the final relaxation at the end of the work-out sequences, you can then just choose the meditation sequence after and move into that for a sense of relaxation and calmness, and I find that compliments the yoga work-out quite well.

The only reason I did not give this 5-stars is, as others have been saying, the ques are off and wrong, and until you really know the practice (I don't yet), you have to watch the screen, cause he does say the wrong leg at times, and the instructions are just a little hard to follow on their own... like, I don't always understand what he is saying to do without looking at him. And you have to follow what leg they are doing and not listen to his choice, cause it is wrongly stated alot of the time.

4285327,5,B0047HXMPM,"I bought this about a week ago.  I was somewhat hesitant after reading one review that thought this was too difficult for an overweight beginner, and another one that said you would not work up a sweat.  I have practiced Yoga off and on for 20 + years, and am once again working my way back into it.

So far I have done the 18 minute workout for one week daily.  While I am overweight I am able to do all of the positions, and I do break a sweat.  I have not weighed myself so cannot attest to any weight loss, but feel pretty good after doing the workout.  I can see a difference in the way my clothes fit already!  Initially my left hip was quite painful.  After a few days the pain subsided and now I can move it smoothly along with the DVD instruction.  Thanks, Trudie and James!

This is well done, and well thought out for weight loss.  I would highly recommend this DVD to beginners and to those who are periodic yogis for weight loss.  I suspect that the advanced yoga practitioners do not need to lose weight, and therefore this may not be much of a challenge to them.

I have had no problem accessing the menu to go to the workout of my choice and am easily able to bypass the sales pitches.  BTW, Gaiam,  I would really like to be able to purchase your DVDs without the commercials.",1309996800,60,1293,4.178137651821863
4285328,3,B0047HXMPM,"I tried out Trudie Styler's Weight Loss Yoga for the first time today. I chose to do the total body yoga workout. It had great potential to win me over. However, verbal instruction is very important to me in yoga practice and I am disappointed to report that there are errors. A couple are somewhat minor, such as being told to bend the wrong knee or turn the wrong foot. But, the one that is most aggravating is being told to lunge the wrong foot forward. Once I realize I'm working on the wrong side it throws off the whole flow to switch my stance. I even rewound the DVD to be sure I listened correctly, and then still doubting myself I did the workout a second time. Sure enough, there are definately mistakes.

A couple of weeks ago, I strained my back muscles, instead of seeing my doctor I decided to give it try to cure the pain myself by practicing the yoga daily ( about 1 hr plus warm up). Less than a week, the pain was gone! How can I not to love the DVDs?

Well, among my entire collection of workout DVDs I have (around 200), Trudy and James' DVDs are on my top fav list. The reason I say James is that he's the true creator of all Trudy's DVDs I think. No offence Trudy. I still think you've done a brilliant job by introducing your workout serious to me. But James certainly deserves the credits since he's the main contributor of Trudy's DVDs.

4285333,5,B0047HXMPM,"I find the whole series of Trudie Styler's dvd's creative, flowing, great music and set up.  Bonus features are also great and its a workout unlike a ""boot camp""...very artistic and fun!",1303084800,2,186,4.8125
8418184,5,B0047HXMPM,"Interestingly the reason I love the workout is because it is the best way to stretch my legs fully as well as my feet. I have planar faciitis and this feels so good, stretches your hamstrings, calves, feet and toes. It's heaven on my feet and relieves the pain.",1526860800,,261,4.346938775510204

8418190,2,B0047HXMPM,"Today I had enough and threw the dvd away. I like the workout, but there are mistakes that make it impossible to lose myself in the workout and stay on track. When it comes to yoga, the verbal instruction should match exactly with what the instructor is doing. It's impossible to follow James D Silva as he constantly says one side but moves the other.",1473811200,,352,4.430769230769231
8418191,3,B0047HXMPM,"I did not care for this yoga video. I have quite a few yoga videos so thought I would like this one, but it is way too advanced for me apparently. I thought the poses were a bit too challenging for my level (intermediate). Not really sure any of these poses actually help with weight loss because I only tried the poses once.",1470096000,,325,4.174603174603175

8418193,1,B0047HXMPM,Was a lot harder than I expected and really hard to follow. It is difficult to do most of these moves and tilt your head up to watch the television at the same time.,1450051200,,165,3.8823529411764706
