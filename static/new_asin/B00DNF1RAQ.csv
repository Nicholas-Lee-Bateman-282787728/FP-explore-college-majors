5835573,5,B00DNF1RAQ,"Enjoyable light Christmas Movie.  Love the cast. Plots a little so so, but the cast makes up for it. Worth watching.",1392076800,,116,4.523809523809524
5835574,2,B00DNF1RAQ,Not good storyline.  Too unreal and boring.  Poor acting. I watched it until and end and then I threw it away.,1389916800,,110,4.190476190476191
5835575,1,B00DNF1RAQ,"Did I mention that it's really, really, stupid?  And boring?  And that the acting, especially of the ""old folks"" - Santa and Mrs. C - is so, so, so, very BAD?  Wow.  This one is a rock, of the catastrophic, mega-meteor, gonna-hit-the-earth-and-decimate-it type.  Really bad.  The positively nauseating giddiness of the parents!  The false deer-in-the-headlights cluelessness of the girlfriend!  The Jr. Claus' what-am-I-to-do namby-pamby act.  Wow - or wow or maybe just ""w"".  And yes, the living-together-thing is immoral.  But that's today's world...and if it's not that aspect, it's the absolutely appalling clothing, or almost clothed-ness, of the females in almost everything that's available - which by the way - doesn't seem to be taken into account for the ratings.  And it should be...another pet peeve.  But that's ""other movies.""  This one just Stinks - with a capital ""S.""",1389484800,3,884,5.266187050359712
5835576,4,B00DNF1RAQ,"I watched this film when it aired on Lifetime in 2012, so I was delighted to see it arrive on DVD.  As a Shelley Long fan, I had to have this for my collection.

I think it is a very cute movie, and I enjoy watching it.  It is fun to see Shelley Long and George Wendt reunite.  The rest of the cast all do a great job as well.",1388188800,,326,3.6142857142857143
5835577,4,B00DNF1RAQ,This is a humorous Christmas movie that is great for the entire family.  The plot is fairly simple: Santa's son wants to marry someone who does not believe in the existence of Santa.,1383868800,10,182,4.515151515151516
5835578,5,B00DNF1RAQ,It is a cute story (more for adults). Well written and well acted. More interesting than many holiday movies. Shelley and George are in rare form and add much to the movie.,1383782400,15,172,4.40625
5835579,4,B00DNF1RAQ,I liked this movie when I saw it on TV last Christmas.  I am not paying $13 for it though!  There are REALLY GOOD TV Christmas movies for less than $7...this one should be in the same financial ballpark!!!,1383264000,,205,4.230769230769231
5835580,3,B00DNF1RAQ,i LOVE CHRISTMAS DVDS AND WATCH THEM OVER AND OVER - THIS ONE WAS OKAY AND WILL PROBABLY WATCH AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS,1382745600,,116,3.875
5835581,5,B00DNF1RAQ,This is a very good and funny Christmas movie about a guy who is Santa Clauss son getting engaged to his girlfriend and trying to hide his parents true identity from her still. Things really get out of hand when her parents meet them and everyone in her family-except her son-thinks his family is either way too conventional or nuts. As I said this movie is a funny one and a good one. You should get it. Merry Christmas.,1381968000,24,421,4.341772151898734
5835582,5,B00DNF1RAQ,"Fabulously funny! This was a great movie that didn't get the national attention it should have. Great movie, I definitely recommend it.",1473465600,,135,5.181818181818182
5835583,4,B00DNF1RAQ,Glad to see Shelley Long play a role where she can have fun.  She is more than capable of playing Diane Chambers.  This family film is a must see.  Watch and enjoy .,1472083200,,165,3.9393939393939394
5835584,5,B00DNF1RAQ,"To be fair, I'd probably watch paint dry if it involved Lucas Bryant, but this was a cute movie.  I enjoyed it, even in July, when it's 900 degrees outside.",1469318400,,156,4.2
5835585,5,B00DNF1RAQ,"I love this movie! Shelley Long is a gem in it! I am a huge Christmas movie fanatic! I own well over 100 Christmas movies alone. I had to add this to my collection. I watch Christmas movies all year round for that feel good feeling that they give you, which we need to feel all year round! You won't regret buying this one. It's really cute!",1468800000,2,341,4.104477611940299
5835586,3,B00DNF1RAQ,I bought this for a gift for a sick friend. He loves it!,1467936000,,56,3.3846153846153846

5835592,4,B00DNF1RAQ,"Poor Peter Claus (Lucas Bryant) proposes to his girlfriend Alex Spencer (Kassia Warshawski) and she balks at the idea, saying I don't know, before she reluctantly says yes.  The worst part is yet to come...........meeting her coldblooded parents.  Her father is nasty and given to reminding her, I have never been wrong, you know that.  They are the in-laws from hell.  He tells his grandson there is no such thing as Santa.  And who should pop in for a quick visit, Mr. & Mrs. Claus (George Wendt and Shelley Long).  Both are jolly.  Their idea of a proper meal is all sweets (I knew that was one of the major food groups!).  Things rapidly escalate out of control from there when the evil dad sets out to investigate Mr. Claus and will stop at nothing to do so, including a DNA test!  Alexs ex-boyfriend stalks her, stakes out her house, and photographs Peter in a compromising situation with an elf.  (These unsavory elements in the story are never addressed and no apologies were forthcoming from the sneaks involved.)  Naturally, Alex sides with her dreadful dad.  (How do you backtrack from rejecting someone you supposedly love then dismiss on your dads say-so?  What happened to trust?)

Weird.  More weird than romantic.  At least Wendt and Long were fun.
I don't know why there are reindeer on the DVD cover, there were no reindeer involved.  Santas sleigh runs electronically, without the aid of reindeer.
Weird.",1448755200,2,1423,4.790123456790123

5835597,4,B00DNF1RAQ,"Well, put together about twenty-percent of, surviving/aging, CHEERS cast-members. Have the largest guy be Santa;
and throw in a face you haven't seen in years as Ms Claus. Believe that their son is marrying---as it were---a non-be-
liever.
A harmless piece of fluff. I enjoyed it, but it wouldn't get an Emmy/Oscar.",1431734400,,315,5.076923076923077

5835618,4,B00DNF1RAQ,"Had a lot of fun with this funny silly family movie.  Very cute, Shelley Long was a pip as Mrs. Claus.  She stole her scenes.  Good funny fair for all.  The storyline has a young man has asked his girlfriend to marry him.  Now he has to spring on her that his mom and dad are really Mr. & Mrs. Santa Claus.  He is a teacher for young children and she is a scientist.  Her parents are really straight laced academians, one is a famous scientist and the other a psychologist.  Problems arise.  One cute scene has Shelley Long, who has prepared the meal, announce we are vegetarians and then proceeds to serve fruit cake and cookies for dinner",1415664000,,640,4.310924369747899

5835623,2,B00DNF1RAQ,We own a Sony 400 disc blu ray player and I put this Christmas movie in and I was shocked that it said the name was Dolph Lundgin in a very angry pose with a gun. I don't like this happening as now I know that someone took an old disc with a bad movie and put a Christmas movie over it. Now I have a very mean and awful picture on my screen for a nice soft Christmas movie. I guess we have to be careful of what we buy. I really thought getting my movies from Amazon they would be safe. I guess the world is not changing for the best.,1411516800,,534,3.734513274336283
