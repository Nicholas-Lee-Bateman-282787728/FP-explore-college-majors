7793404,3,092926505X,"Classic Images did some of the best/worst videos of the Civil War reenactment scene in the Eighties for the 125th series of events. They are the best in that they perfectly capture their time. The are the worst because they incorporate some of the lousiest acting you will ever see (this one has the priceless Gettysburg ""Council of War"" reenacted scene with the most wooden acting this side of Pinocchio). Reenactors are NOT actors.

Anyway, get it to relive memories if you were there. I was. The 125th was so much better than the current 150th - we were all so much younger and more earnest then. Nowadays Civil War reenacting is an AARP activity - not at all the same.",1388102400,,672,4.553719008264463
