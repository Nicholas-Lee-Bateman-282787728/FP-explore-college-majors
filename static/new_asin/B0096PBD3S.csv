8536847,3,B0096PBD3S,"This film is a bit weird. I had low expectations when I noticed the previews were for films like ""Alien Armageddon"" which were low budget sci-fi indie disasters.

The film opens rather bizarrely as they find a woman in the desert, who we later find out is actually an attack droid. It switches to 200 years later when said red headed droid wakes up naked in a chamber and it is not Milla Jovovich, but Robin Kurtz not looking a day over 100. She is called Helen and is caught between a war between humans and apparently aliens who came through a wormhole, but that was not too well developed. The aliens create undead humans through nanobite blood transmissions that require head shots to kill. There are also cheesy killer CG bots fought with CG bullets.

The blood splatter is also CG and always splashes on the camera irregardless of camera angle or direction of bullet. Helen is naked for about the first 15 minutes of the film at which time she finds clothes. The bad news is that she doesn't resemble the babe on the cover, in fact no one does and the costumes are different. There is also a reference to ""scripture"" that ""Humanity will end itself."" This ties into the story as the end is rather clever, too bad they hired lousy actors, had bad dialouge, and lacked a budget in general.

Parental Guidance: F-bombs. No sex, Full Frontal nudity. A 2011 film originally known as ""Earthkiller.""  $9.96 Walmart",1366588800,3,1412,4.591269841269841
