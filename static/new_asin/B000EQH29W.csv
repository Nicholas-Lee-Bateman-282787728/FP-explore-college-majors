However, it could be so much better than it is. I wanted to show this to my music students, who all want to ultimately work in the Music Business This DVD is SO gospel/Christian orientated, that I think they would find it hard to screen it in order to get any information of value out of it.

The DVD basically interviews various gospel DJs from gospel radio stations, which is fine, but that's all it is. The business principles are there, but so much of it is with reference to God, that I think my students would have a hard time watching it. No offense to God, but it is just not relevant to the subject in hand.

Someone needs to make an up to date DVD on understanding the music business. This is not it.",1161734400,3,847,4.158536585365853
