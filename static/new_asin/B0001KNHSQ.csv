2010111,4,B0001KNHSQ,"This PBS documentary is, as stated in the title, a quick and selective historical narrative. It mostly covers the Tokogawa political history and the impact of the West, especially that of Christianity. It takes the viewer from the beginning of Shogun Japan through to its demise. In other words, from the time Westerners first reached Japan until the arrival of Commodore Perry.  This video uses a compilation of sources from an outside point of view as well as using local historical documentation. It focuses on the differences of Japan in comparison to the West and the depth and advancements of the complexities of historical Japan. I enjoyed the use of dramatic recreation, but thought that it could have gone into more detail on the cultural aspects of isolationalism. This video is great for those who wish to learn more about Japan's past and have no prior historical knowledge of this era.",1129766400,8,898,4.947019867549669
2010112,4,B0001KNHSQ,"If you like Japanese history you will enjoy it. I liked it, but it was like being in a history class(not very exciting). I really like samarai history so It was good for me.",1125100800,2,173,4.117647058823529
2010113,4,B0001KNHSQ,"Overall I was glad I got this DVD.  Like other reviews, I was also frustrated by the recycling of some scenes, but that happens in many documentaries so I wasn't that disappointed.  If you don't know much about this period of Japan, I definitely recomend this DVD.  Even if you do know a lot, it's still worth it for the stories, costumes, and the amount of info they provide.  The film quality is good (as it should be) and so is the music.  Unlike most documentaries that try to fit everything into 1 hour, you get three discs with this set.  It's a lot for the money and well worth it.",1120521600,6,588,4.252252252252252
2010114,4,B0001KNHSQ,"I enjoyed the documentary and thought that it was very well-directed.  The shooting of the documentary was very nice, and the scenes done where people dressed up as samurai or feudal peasants was done pretty well, not the usual hookey costumes done in the cheaper or older films.  They included many beautiful pictures of Japan and included much of the ancient artwork.  My only criticism for the film was that it appeared to be too western world biased.  Throughout the film, it is done with the usual western self-centeredness that we are often criticized for.  It was good to hear the westerners' point of view at the time, but I think that there should have been more input from what the feudal Japanese thought.  It made it appear that Japan had little to do with its own shaping, but was rather molded by the western world.  Also, at the end of the documentary,it made it sound that Commodore Perry forcing his way into Japan was the best thing that ever happened to them.  Perhaps a little bit too opinionated for someone as opinionated like myself.  Despite my lengthy criticism, it was an interesting documentary; however, the Tokugawa era is an easy subject to make interesting.  I recommend watching this film, but I would keep an open mind to not follow all biases and decide for yourself.",1119744000,3,1301,4.716814159292035
2010115,3,B0001KNHSQ,"The disc holds three parts - the first part talks about Samurai and the setting o Japan in general.  The second examines how Japan was slowly united, first Oda Nobunaga, then under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and finally under Tokuhawa Ieyasu.  His family would rule Japan as the Shoguns for over two and a half centuries.  The last part deals with how Japan was again open to the ouside world.

I give it a three because a lot of details are missing and there is a lot of repeat and overlap.  Scenes are recycled many times and sometimes the events and history can get confusing.  There are no extras and, frankly, even with a person who knows a lot of the history a timeline would have been nice.",1119571200,10,689,4.428571428571429
2010116,4,B0001KNHSQ,"This documentary culls together troves of research and brings together a credible group of experts who tell the story of Japan's ""renaissance."" Three centuries of self-imposed isolation and societal discipline defined Japan, and this period deserves study by those who seek to understand modern Japan.

The stregnths of the film can easily be seen: excellent source material, most stikingly the use of traditional art to convey history. Also, for the purpose of educating Westerners, the documentary dwells on the accounts of the scattered missionaries who either suffered or prospered under the Japanse order.

The film employs many Japanese actors, editors and producers, thus enhancing its authenticity. The credit reel attests to a trans-pacific endeavor.

The photography on the recreated scenes is striking, even hautingly beautiful. But too many of the images are recycled througout the film to annoying effect. The same image of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the man who unites Japan under his shogunate, is used to display him both as a young man and as an elder leader.

But if you can get behind this minor annoyance as well as the sometimes cliched narration, most viewers - be it a Japan scholars or those who don't know anything about this island empire -  will gain something. B+",1097971200,22,1281,5.169082125603865
2010117,5,B0001KNHSQ,"After being involved for more than 26 years in martial arts, visiting Japan, etc. I could only say that it is a great DVD.

2010341,5,B0001KNHSQ,"This episode of the PBS Empires series focuses on the Japan of the Shogunate. It does an excellent job of touching upon the essentials of Japanese society and history during this time period. The video is divided into three segments.

The first segment covers the three uniters - the three men who ended the warring states period to wrest sole control away from the Daimyo and consolidate power under their own control. Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi gained control in turn, but it would be Tokugawa Ieyasu who would initiate a Shogunate that he and his descendants would bring peace to Japan and that dynasty would rule Japan for almost three hundred years. This segment also highlights the coming of The Portuguese and the Catholic Church which would bring new technologies to Japan and bring a new religion that would take root.

The second segment informs the viewer on the rule, over time, of the Tokugawa Shoguns. Tokugawa himself banned the Portuguese traders and their Roman Catholic Jesuit priests. There was a desire to keep the status quo. The Shogun himself saw change as dangerous - and this included religion. As time went on, the taxation by the Shoguns rose to very high levels that eventually led to rebellion. This rebellion, in the south of the country, soon became a Christian rebellion that ended in the deaths of thousands and almost total destruction of the Christian community in Japan.

The third segment portrays Japan in the log peace of the shogunate in which samurai, in the absence of war, declined in wealth and status. Samurai survived on tiny stipends and saw their importance disappear as the merchant class gained in wealth and status. The DVD touches on the courtesians and geisha and the life of the courtesan. It ends with the coming of the west in the form of Commodore Perry's mission to Japan.

This is not a comprehensive record of Japan, but touches on the most important aspects of Japan's history and culture. I thought it was very revealing on many topics and I enjoyed the well-made and produced DVD. I felt this was a well-made and informative DVD and I recommend it with five stars.",1399593600,2,2136,4.8119891008174385

2010373,5,B0001KNHSQ,"A fascinating and intriguing  series that encompasses the rich history of Japan. One finds a glimpse of the elaborate system of policies and regulations imposed upon each facet of society.  Well narrated with included interviews and reenactments that seem to enlighten rather than be a detraction. The beauty of the country at that time adds another dimension to the traditional artistry and writings of centuries past.

Follow the entry of the Portuguese and the introduction of Catabolism, the beginning of the English/Dutch Protestant influence to the expulsion of all foreigners and into complete isolationism. The vivid display of artworks/writings and the details of customs/ceremonies combine to create a series of exceptional quality.

Each episode is complete within itself and leaves the viewer with expectations and curiosity about the next episode. Exceptionally well documented and presented view of the 16th and 17th century in Japan.

'The Way of the Samurai' offers an understanding of what transpired in later centuries.

'The Return of the Barbarians'
After 265 years isolationism comes to an end. Samurai, geisha, courtesans, merchants, writers and actors are now one class.  1853 sees Mathew C. Perry enter Edo (Tokyo) Bay with steam ship and cannon. With absolute arrogance, he demands, not asks, that Japan open trade to the United States. Within ten years the samurai class is disbanded but the ethos is not forgotten.

2010409,1,B0001KNHSQ,"I've watched all 3 hours of this racially patronizing, surprisingly biased, old-fashioned, culturally obtuse and hideously Orientalistic documentary. It's of the ""Oriental cavemen stare in wide-eyed wonder at the arrival of the marvelous, technologically advanced Europeans"" sort.

By using narrow storytelling, Japan is actually portrayed as a primitive, corrupt, pugnacious, easy-frightened, superstitious, lewd, technologically-stunted and tyrannical society whose unclean, pagan problems could only be solved by contact with the sophisticated and culturally gracious West. Begrudging obedience towards Europe and the United States out of threat of violence is narrated as being some sort of gentlemanly ""compromise"" to ""choose peace"".

Narrowly sourced (mostly from European memoirs and with heavy amounts of commentary from the faculty members of a private Catholic university in Japan, including the former editor of the Catholic publication Monumenta Nipponica), religiously self-serving and filled with subjective personal opinions, you have to watch this PBS documentary (produced during the Bush administration) with two inviolable premises as a precondition: that Jesus Christ died for your sins and that Europeans are innocent explorers whose presence should be welcomed, not resisted.

Here are just some of the quotes you will hear: the Japanese people walk ""as if they are swimming in the air"". ""The Shogun didn't tolerate dissidence; especially any who looked to Jesus for help"", and Japanese food is ""pretty to look at but [is] generally so tough that it's difficult to move one's teeth if one attempts to chew.""

If you are hopelessly uneducated about pre-modern Japan and if you want to spend 3 hours watching a human zoo village documentary filled with exotic, cherry-picked information then go ahead: jump into a time machine, travel back to the 1920's, turn off your critical thinking, put on your best irredentist Christian martyr T-shirt, open up a can of White Manifest Destiny, and watch this bizarre compendium.",1364774400,7,2038,5.672131147540983

2010425,5,B0001KNHSQ,"An excellent 1-disc, 3-hour PBS documentary of the Tokugawa Shogunate period that is Japan's middle history. I sincerely doubt that any better, concise English film summary of this period exists anywhere.

The documentary is narrated by Richard Chamberlain, star of the 10-hour, 1980 fact-based award-winning adaptation of James Clavell's ""Shogun,"" to which it is an excellent companion piece. (The first 90 minutes corresponds to the time period in ""Shogun."")

This PBS piece is filled with gorgeous, historically accurate, flattering visuals. It runs eyes closely over authentic samurai dress, Japanese castles & temples, the forging of swords, tea ceremonies, Japanese calligraphy & art, the painting of geishas. Well worth watching for this reason alone.

The 1st hour opens in 1543 with birth of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the arrival of the first European merchant ships and Jesuits, then chronicles the politics and battles leading to the unification of Japan under Ieyasu.

The 2nd hour begins in 1600 with Ieyasu, now titled Shogun, ruling the merchants/farmers of Japan via a samurai middle-class, and follows the rule of grandson Iemitsu, as he tightens control, persecutes Christians and, in the 1640s, isolates Japan from the outside world.

The 3rd hour begins in 1700, where Japan enjoys peace, prosperity and intellectual pursuit. Edo, home to Ieyasu's castle, has blossomed into the city that will become Toyko. This hour covers about 150 years, during which Japanese high culture, and a growing interest in the outside world, matures. Samurai warriors, under peace, morph into a ceremonial class that vests Japan's history, ceremony, ethic and pride. The hour concludes with the 1853 arrival of Perry's fleet, forcing Japan open to world trade.

2010426,3,B0001KNHSQ,"This video is very informative.  As a moderately knowledgeable person on Japanese history during the ""warring era"", I still learned new information.

It doesn't contain the variety of re-enactments, ""on-location"" views of historical events, historical photos and/or art work that connect directly to the spoken narrative.",1272067200,2,439,5.707692307692308

I tried to elicit their attention by giving some preliminary information; having a short preview and a sort of ""what to watch for"" information to direct students' attention to what was important in the film. This is essential for 8th graders especially and for educational reasons in particular.
We found the film repeated the same information so much that it was wasting our precious class time. Much of the information was interesting; however, it could have been given in a more dynamic manner and in less time by not repeating the same thing about only a few people. Normally, PBS has motivating films that capture my students' attention. We were all disappointed. I will not show this film next year although I have not yet found a substitute that covers the same time span. I need something on ancient Japan from the 600s to the 1600s AD, the rise of military society, shoguns, daimyos, and samurai warriors.",1247011200,10,964,4.848484848484849
2010428,3,B0001KNHSQ,"I picked up this video for use with my 8th Grade class. We do a unit on Japanese literature of the Medieval and Tokugawa periods and I used Episode 2 as an introduction.

I loved the visual style of the film. It is striking and dramatic, with re-enactment footage helping the viewer to visualize the clothing, etiquette, and lifestyles of the period. A great deal of valuable information is covered in a compressed period of time without being difficult to understand. So far so good.

However, the film has a very ""Eurocentric"" attitude right from the get-go. Before Episode 1 even begins, the voice-over announces that Japan was a world completely the opposite of Europe. The rest of the film continues to hammer this idea of Japan as ""other."" Although the film quotes generously from primary sources about the period. most of these sources are European missionaries. The implication is that we can only understand the strange Japanese culture by reading the memoirs of Portugese Jesuits who spent a few months there. This ignores the fact that Japan at the time was certainly just as accomplished a literary culture as any in Europe, with plenty of authors writing compelling works showing much greater understanding and insight about the culture than European visitors could offer. The film also seems obsessed with the fate of the Christian religion in Japan. This is an interesting story, but it is really only significant to the country's history when discussing the final uprising of the Christians which led directly to the Shogun closing Japan off from outside visitors. Meanwhile, important topics like Shinto, the Emperor, and Zen Buddhism are barely mentioned.

One section that does use a Japanese primary source is the valuable discussion in Episode 2 of travel during the Tokugawa period. The film uses the journal of a Japanese woman, describing the special difficulties women faced in traveling around Japan. This was interesting and enlightening. It was also good to see a woman's perspective in the middle of such a male-dominated tale of power struggles and war.
Overall, I give the film a middling review. The visuals and wealth of information presented is good, but the distorted, Eurocentric focus is a real drawback.",1240876800,61,2241,5.051351351351351

As usual, PBS puts together a well researched, balanced report. As a bonus, it lacks the usual bias that most documentaries seem to inherently possess, and offers very little in a way of ""directorial opinion"".

I did, however, feel that it relied to heavily on visuals at times, especially on the section covering the Meiji period. I would have preferred a little more detail, especially concerning the upcoming culture wars (not covered in this documentary).

This documentary covers the period that started with the arrival of the first Europeans and a bloody civil war raging in the 16th century C.E. that led to the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603 C.E.  After defeating his remaining adversaries in 1600 C.E., Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed Shogun by the emperor and established his capital in Edo, the future Tokyo, in 1603 C.E.  Ieyasu's successors, the Shoguns, remained in power for over 250 years until the Meiji restoration in 1868 C.E., which ushered Japan into its modern era.  Japan, Memoirs of a Secret Empire, ends with the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry and his ships on Japan's shores in 1853 C.E.  This arrival ultimately sealed the downfall of the Tokugawa Shogunate, which was unable to cope with the opening of Japan to the outside world.  To its credit, Japan, Memoirs of a Secret Empire, brings to light the sophisticated, refined Japanese civilization in its splendor.  This production clearly explained the interactions existing among the Samurai, peasants, artisans, merchants, and the rest of the society such as artists and priests.
