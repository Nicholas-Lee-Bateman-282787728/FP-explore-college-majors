7673354,3,B01CAN6N3M,I liked this movie bc of how casual the horror / scary things that happened were depicted. Beautiful cinematography. The plot got confusing and weird at the very end...SPOILER ALERT...did Ronaldo kill Piotr?...since the car being pushed into the lake? I think he did since he was the one who announced that Piotr was missing and he was carrying a torch for the bride.,1480982400,3,367,4.75

7673356,4,B01CAN6N3M,"""Demon"" (2015 release from Poland; 94 min.) brings the story of Peter, an English guy who is about to marry his Polish fiancee. As the movie opens, we see Peter arriving at a construction site, and in conversation with his future father-in-law, who expresses doubt about the upcoming marriage, given the apparent short courtship between his daughter Zaneta and Peter. But the wedding plans are on. Later that day, Peter arrives at the countryside home of Zaneta's family, which is in dire need for some fixing up. When Peter does some cleaning up in the yard, he comes across the remains of a skeleton, and before we know it, strange things start happening. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is perhaps billed as a horror movie, but it really isn't. It really is more of a psychological thriller, rooted deeply in Polish family traditions. Much of the movie plays out over the course of the long wedding night (ceremony, followed by the wedding reception, dinner, and post-dinner celebration). I noticed in the movie's credits that it is in fact based on a theater play, and the movie certainly reflects that (and that is not meant as a criticism). Rather than a horror story, you instead get the constant feeling that something creepy is going on. There are a number of worthwhile performances, including Israeli actor Itay Tiran as Peter/Piotr and Andrzej Grabowski as the patriarch of Zaneta's family. Given the nature of the film, I don't want to disclose much more, but I can only tell you that I became transfixed as this played out, and couldn't hardly believe it how quickly this all went by.

The movie premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, yes, over a year ago. (Sadly, the movie's director Marcin Wrona took his own life not long thereafter.) It opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, just a handful of people. Given the lack of marketing, it didn't really surprise me. If you are in the mood for a creepy (in the best possible way) and haunting psychological drama, I'd readily recommend you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1475280000,3,2470,4.768691588785047
7673357,4,B01CAN6N3M,"How does one tell the horrific story of Jews in Poland before and after the Holocaust, if not through a horror film?

That's the logic behind the late Polish director Marcin Wrona's unforgettable final film, Demon, a chilling, eerie cautionary tale about the ghosts that continue to haunt Poland long after the war.

At once a shocking, baroque freak-out and a finely tuned, brilliantly paced surrealist black comedy, Demon is set in a small Polish town at a wedding that's hijacked by the ghost of a Jewish woman killed seven decades earlier.

Wrona was considered one of Poland's greatest young filmmakers when, at age 42, he committed suicide last September, a week after Demon premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. The tragedy held up the film's international distribution.

A Polish-Israeli coproduction, Demon poses a difficult question: How do we define Poland today when we take into account the millions of ghosts that linger there? Ghosts, indeed: Once the epicenter of the Jewish diaspora, Poland was home to 3,474,000 Jews before WWII. Today, they number 3,200.

Considering that Poland was home to some of the Nazis' most prolific death camps, one can't help but imagine that the very ground Poles stand on today covers the bones of murdered people.

The film's minimalist narrative, which was adapted from a 2008 play by Piotr Rowicki, opens with the discovery of some of those bones.

Israeli actor Itay Tiran (Lebanon, The Dead and the Living) stars as Piotr, a young Pole raised in England who returns home to marry Zaneta (Agnieszka Zulewska), the daughter of one of the town's most successful landowners.

Dad (Andrzej Grabowski) - most of the characters are simply identified by their function or social position - has blessed the union by giving the couple the estate house his family once occupied amid the rolling hills, verdant dales, and fresh streams of their farmland.

For Piotr, the place is the very definition of heaven, and he starts renovating the decrepit house the day he arrives. Alas, Piotr's heaven is replaced by hell when his little bulldozer digs up human remains buried deep in the garden.

Then, the wedding kicks off. A wild, daylong affair, it sinks into an absurdist farce when the handsome groom starts acting really, really odd. He talks in a funny language, refers to himself as a woman, and dances a freaky folk dance.

Dad is beside himself: The lavish wedding reception he has bankrolled is the biggest social event the town has seen in decades. What's more, it reinforces his status as the area's most powerful man.

Zaneta is concerned, but determined not to let any weirdness stop her big day.

And most of their guests - the Doctor, the Teacher, the Priest, the Aunt, the Dance Leader agree.

They aren't impressed when an old Jewish guest realizes Piotr has been speaking Yiddish the whole time. They're annoyed, not fascinated, when the old man explains that Piotr has been invaded by a dybbuk, a malevolent being familiar from Jewish folklore.

Who was this woman? How did she die? What does she want from Piotr?

In a chilling turn of events, we realize no one really cares what the ghost is up to. All they want to do is bury the bones again and keep hurtling headlong, drunk, optimistic, content into the future.

Should we begrudge them their hopes and ambitions - even as we realize they're dancing on graves?

Demon may remind some viewers of the 2012 murder mystery Aftermath by Wrona's compatriot Wladyslaw Pasikowski, about two brothers who find a mass grave under their father's home.

Both films ask uncomfortable questions about the effect that past atrocities have on present hopes - questions many of us would rather not contemplate.",1473897600,8,3708,4.913461538461538

7673364,3,B01CAN6N3M,"I'm still trying to figure out why so many fake reviews for a film that can hold it's own in it's own genre?? I understand this film is inexplicably out of place in the ""horror/thriller"" category, but in it's own right, it's a very well acted, well thought out script that (with the right historical knowledge and understanding of where the film is going) is an excellent film, that is definitely worth the watch! I didn't happen to see the trailer, but am well aware of the bait and switch that goes on (especially in the horror thriller category) that leaves many a ""Saw/Purge/Zombie apocalypse"" fans sorely disappointed and dissatisfied (if not angry) they were led astray for the less than couple hours of their lives. That's what has left me perplexed with these fake reviews, leading the readers to believe it actually IS a horror/thriller flick? I'm certain this film would draw in the proper numbers if it were advertised in an honest way, leaving it's intended audience as impressed as the  scrutinizing judges of the film festivals who felt this film was deserving enough to receive the prestigious awards it garnered.

7673366,3,B01CAN6N3M,"A modern movie really about sins of the past, not a horror. There was another recent Polish film similar in nature involving someone finding Jewish grave stones hidden as paving stones in a small village and later being killed for the action of exposing them (called ""Aftermath""). But Poles are portrayed pretty poorly in this film, in my opinion. But there exists more than a few films surrounding Polish wedding debauchery, though not in this context. But Poles seem to relish filming the waining hours of a party when all have lost their senses, while portraying something significant passing, noting ""the wedding"" and ""Ashes to Diamonds (the last a famous movie by Andrzej Wajda).

7673367,3,B01CAN6N3M,"Possible spoilers. First, theres no demon. The acting in this was outstanding from many characters and especially the male lead. The plot of possession from the dead during your wedding was also promising. However, nothing really happens and because youve been bombarded throughout the movie by the endless wedding you don't care. The director didn't seem to have a clue on how to take what was being done to a higher level. The dead woman that disappeared and possessing the groom would have been a great back story and infusing from Exorcist type of material would have added a lot. The humor was good but it was hap hazardous. With some attractive women in the wedding party you have to wonder why they picked who they did for the bride and you have to wonder why hes marrying her in the first place. in a movie called Demon you really shouldnt be asking those questions unless you're really bored. If you want to see a lot of a Polish wedding and drinking youll be well entertained. If you want to see a thriller with perhaps a little horror youll be very disappointed. This could easily have been a 5-star movie if someone had a clue on how to develop the plot; the missing girl and her sisters; and how the body actually ended up where it did. Lastly, the ending was a letdown and it was like they ran out of time and didn't know what to do next with the possessed groom plus the music was intended for a Polish only audience and it was relentless.",1508630400,,1454,4.449438202247191

7673379,5,B01CAN6N3M,"An almost vitriolic sociopolitical critique, masterfully executed through poetic metaphor, wrapped within a ghost story within a Jewish folk tale beside a family drama.  This film makes its statement loud and clear, and the Dybbuk may not be who or what you think it is.

Beautiful cinematography, great acting, and an amazing soundtrack all come together to tell this, and many other stories simultaneously.  I recommend repeated viewings in order to extract as many layers as possible (I've thus far watched it twice in less than 24 hours, just so I could wrap my head around it to some degree).

This film will not appeal to everyone, and though it should be, and the now deceased writer/director probably intended it to be, it is not for everyone.  I recommend having at least some knowledge of World War Two era Poland, and some grasp of the Jewish Dybbuk story, as going in totally blind to history and the atrocities that brought forth the historical events reenacted in this film may simply lead to confusion.

""Demon"" can hold its own to some degree as a fairly typical possession/ghost story, but most viewers who want nothing more than that will be disappointed.  There are no creepy puppets, CGI explosions, cheesy jump-scares, or exhibitions of senseless torture-porn here.

At its highest level we can take it as a cautionary tale, and indeed we should. Perhaps, look at it this way:  The ""horror"" in this film goes far deeper than what is shown here.  This tale has been told many times, but it seems that it is always in need of repeating:

""Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""  -George Santayana",1498694400,7,1892,4.896551724137931

It's very well done, but the ""horror"" concept is really just a delivery vehicle for what is really a metaphor for the impact that the holocaust has had on the collectively psyche of Eastern Europe.  The inclusion of the Catholic Priest, and how he behaves, is a clear signal of this, as is the wild party taking place, with the willfully ignorant father caring for nothing beyond appearances and his own image, as a horrible tragedy is unfolding just out of sight.

7673395,5,B01CAN6N3M,"Hitchcock's films often left viewers with unanswered questions; yet people didn't complain much and he became known as a master of suspense.  With the passage of time, it seems audiences (American ones, at least) wanted the guesswork done for them.  You will not like this film if you want answers - now.  Indeed, you will probably hate it as many reviews here can attest.  But if you're open-minded and have a decent grasp of the humanities, you may be surprised by what this film offers.
A groom-to-be arrives in Poland from the UK to marry his bride and meet his in-laws.  While digging around the property of the dilapidated farmhouse which is his new home, the groom discovers human remains and soon begins seeing the spirit of the woman to whom those remains belong.  Soon thereafter, at his wedding reception, the spirit takes control, leaving his family and guests bewildered and, in many cases, quite angry.
This possession isn't another Exorcist-ish freakshow.  Rather, it takes the audience back in time.  Wedding guests muse about the time Poland was the entire world, a country for Poles, by Poles, until some ""evil element"" entered and divided it.  And when the spirit begins to speak Yiddish, the tragic fate of the Polish Jewry comes to the fore.  Poland, before World War II, had one of the largest Jewish populations in the world.  Casimir the Great gave the Jews of Europe asylum in the Middle Ages when other nations were slaughtering them every chance they could get.  This caused some resentment among the Poles - there is little doubt that this was the ""evil element"" referenced in the film.  And the only person able to make sense of this spirit is the lone Jew at the wedding, an elderly man who is later struck with sorrow when he is driven around the town he once frequented, a town that had a strong Jewish presence now totally gone - buried, if you will.  The film does not solve the riddle of the human remains but the family and guests at the wedding display such an unwillingness to visit the past that they seem complicit.  There is no desire to address what the Holocaust did to the Jews of Poland.  Indeed, the majority of the tiny number who survived left Poland because of the powerful anti-Semitism that remained.
But the film does not preach.  Instead, it skillfully uses suspense and terror as a medium to examine a nation's conscience about matters that should never be forgotten.  Its understated, graceful approach makes it quite outstanding and unique.  My hope is that other screenwriters and directors will at least try to emulate it.",1482883200,36,2580,4.757303370786516

7673407,2,B01CAN6N3M,I really wanted to like this movie. It's an interesting premise...but it was just so dreadfully boring to watch and the ending was completely anticlimactic. I wish I hadn't paid for the rental. I only gave it 2 stars and not 1 because the quality of acting wasn't terrible.,1481414400,4,273,4.591836734693878
7673408,3,B01CAN6N3M,"After reading so many reviews talking about how great of a movie this was, I was very excited to see it. However, I did not think this film was that great. Everyone obviously has their own criteria to determine whether or not they like or love certain movies, but I was looking forward to more of  a
""Thriller"", mainly because of the title, DEMON.
With that said, I didn't think it was a bad movie at all. It was just not my type of film. If you put aside your expectations about the title and the description given for the movie saying what it was about, which was a possession of a newly married man, then you may enjoy it for what it was, which was NOT a ""thriller/mystery"" in my opinion. It was more of  a psychological film centered around one family in Poland, whose daughter was getting ready to marry a man that neither she nor her family knew anything about and then something strange happens to the young man, leading in to some bizarre behavior.
I kept waiting for something to happen with the young man, like some help, but it never materialized and the ending, to me, was confusing and left me with more questions than answers.",1481068800,9,1140,4.398104265402844
8752608,2,B01CAN6N3M,"Like The Babadook, this movie is more of an allegorical tale than a straightforward horror movie. It takes place almost entirely during a Polish wedding in which the groom is suspected of being possessed. There are a lot of strange questions and loose ends that never get resolved, but it would all make a lot more sense to you if you were Polish. The movie isn't really about a demon, it's about the relationship between Jews and Poles post-WWII. If you're hoping for scares, gore, or special effects of any kind, you won't find it here. It's kind of a tough watch despite the great performances, moody score, and tight cinematography. The pacing and actual content are really lacking in the end -- and speaking of the ending, it's a total dud.",1537660800,,745,4.651515151515151
8752609,5,B01CAN6N3M,"This movie is not your typical ""b"" rated horror movie about demons. It is actually a movie about both folklore and history with hints of the supernatural though one is not sure if the groom is just having a mental break down or if he is truly haunted.",1534032000,,251,4.25
8752610,5,B01CAN6N3M,"A superb movie. It has a story within a story and the crux is Itay Tiran, the creepiest part of a creepy movie. He is astounding. His face could tell the story without words. It was disturbing to see him incarnate a man possessed by a woman who loves him
He became soft and sensual, prim and caressing. Truly astonishing acting. I really have to find other movies with him.

Thank goodness this was subtitled. I detest dubbing and it would have destroyed this movie.

The ending was not problematic for me. We know where he went. One bit was copied from Kubrick but this film didn't need it. Kudos to an excellent director. So terrible he committed suicide. I would loved to seen more of his work.

I love these surprising foreign films. They're such a relief from the tremendous amount of garbage movies out of Hollywood.

Well worth watching.",1532131200,,844,4.569536423841059

If you've ever been trapped in a never ending conversation with an elderly foreign man who speaks very poor English, laughs at himself every now and then, and doesn't let you off the hook to make an exit, and you find this experience terrifying, then this movie is for you.

You may also like it if you enjoy metaphorical art house movies, like Mother! and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Since this is my opinion and my review, and I hate these over-the-top metaphorical exercises, one star.",1524355200,2,538,4.604166666666667
