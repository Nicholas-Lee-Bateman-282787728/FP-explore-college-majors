4007971,5,B002WN8IS4,"This was a very unusual police drama.  Dalziel comes off as a gruff blue collar worker, but he is fiercely intelligent.  His partner Pascoe is an ideal book smart foil for Dalziel.  The crimes they solve are far from ordinary, and despite the length of each episode, the stories move at a quick clip.  In technical terms, the DVD transfers are pristine and the episodes are uncut.  Very different from the typical cookie cutter Inspectors that were rife during this period of PBS/BBC presentation.  Watch out for guest appearances by Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) and Francessca Annis(Tuppence Beresford).",1270166400,2,606,5.13265306122449
4007972,5,B002WN8IS4,"Technical Description and Reviews need to be brought up-to-
date. There are 2 disks,with 3 episodes:Clubable Women,
Advancement of Learning,and Autumn Shroud. I saw AOL on TV
years ago,and it stuck in my head (but didn't know what
series it was).I was delighted to see it here. Disks do
have subtitles,but that doesn't help with the slang. Unless
you have a British Slang Dictionary-live with it. There is
some material missing (according to jacket)-probably some
R&R music they couldn't get permission for. Let me give my
wife's initial opinion (""watch"" how it turns). Dalziel is
the star,but he can exhibit crude behavior
but he's quite smart. After ep 1,my wife says- ""I wonder
why people get married"".But by ep 2,she sees in Dalziel
a subtle mind,with a certain underlying kindness (towards
Pascoe,initially) and in ep 3,a humanity. So now she's
interested in other Seasons (I've got 2&3 on order
from the UK -do yourself a favor and get an all region
player).Finally,each ep here is about 90 minutes,so
the total run time is about 270 minutes. Buy this!",1268784000,4,1058,4.949438202247191
4007973,5,B002WN8IS4,"This is another very good UK crime series.  Dalziel is the chief and he is a big burly guy who is loaded with vices.  Pascoe is a younger man on the force who is coming up through the ranks.  He is squeaky clean compared to Dalziel.  The actor for Dalziel often just steals the show entirely.  I find his comic moments absolutely priceless.  Another big difference between the two men is that Pascoe is a college graduate whereas Dalziel is not.  This rankles Dalziel.  The mysteries on the show are very good but they do not stand out from any other UK crime series.  It is these two main characters and the odd assortment of fellow policemen and suspect citizens who are intriguing.  One thing that continually intrigues me on all of these UK crime shows is that no matter how villainous the person they after, they never seem to carry guns. I don't even own a gun but I'm pretty sure if I were chasing murderers that I would want a gun! The UK does very well on all of its crime series and I can see why so many of us Americans are lapping them up.

4007974,5,B002WN8IS4,"I've long been a fan of mystery shows, particularly British, but Dalziel and Pascoe represents the zenith of all mystery shows. With its literate, biting dialogue and tense interaction between the bombastic Dalziel and cerebral, buttoned-down Pascoe (who clearly admire each other, despite their great differences) it's a series that keeps you riveted to the screen and longing for more. As another viewer complained, up until this forthcoming release, there have been no US releases of this series and only the series 1 and 2 releases in the UK. Thank God for the Netherlands release of 3, 4 and 5. Once you've seen this series you'll understand why - you'll be hooked. It aired briefly years ago in the US and then disappeared. Instead, we get insipid, scenery-chewing remakes of Miss Marple (shame on you Geraldine McEwan). Buy this CD, then get yourself a CD player that plays CDs in other formats and buy the rest - it will be the best purchase you've ever made. And then spread the word - sooner or later someone has to wake up and realize what a great property the BBC has and make it more easily accessible! Dalziel and Pascoe is not to be missed!",1260748800,114,1155,4.694581280788177
4007985,5,B002WN8IS4,"I love most British shows, specifically crime dramas. It took me awhile to warm up to this one because Dalziel can be off-putting. I've learned that is exactly how he's supposed to come across . . . so, he's very good at being big, clunky, puffy, and corporeal with some nasty habits I won't list. One night I ran out of things to watch and watched a random episode. All I can say is, somehow the character grows on you, partly because I've found the story lines to be compelling and well-told. Dalziel has a good-looking side-kick which helps balance things, but it's Warren Clarke's show.",1447027200,4,590,4.5754716981132075

4007989,5,B002WN8IS4,"Excellent!  Highly recommended.  Previous reviews have summarized content, so I don't feel it necessary, but I did want to make (2) points.  I was a little bit worried when I could not buy the Season 1 DVD from Amazon directly (given all the negative commentary on the manufacturer's defect in the first disc), but instead had to buy from a secondary vendor ""Fulfilled By Amazon"".  After viewing (30 Jun 15), I can verify that there were no issues with my copy.  Hopefully, the manufacturer has now put this issue to rest.

Also, as other viewers have noted, the accents (particularly that of Superintendent Dalziel) can be a little hard for American audiences to decipher.  After viewing the first episode, I watched the subsequent episodes with subtitles.  What a difference!  While still able to follow the story, I hadn't realized how much of Warren Clarke's subtleties (or lack thereof) I had missed!  I will now have to watch that first episode again.  Perhaps, on viewing further episodes, my ears will become accustomed to this dialect, but for the first-time viewer my suggestion is ""Drop your pride and CHEAT"" with the subtitles!.",1435622400,,1140,4.947368421052632
4007990,2,B002WN8IS4,"Recently, my wife and I have been watching a lot of BBC mystery shows.  And when we ran out of Scott & Bailey, Luther, Vera, MI5 and others we have relied on Amazon reviews to point us to new shows and from those I bought seasons 1-3 of Dalzeil and Pascoe.  Not to be a contrarian but I heartily disagree with the reviewer who called this series ""the zenith of all mystery shows"".

Perhaps it is because I have no interest whatsoever in English Rugby, which was the focus of the first episode, but by the end of the 90 minutes I wanted to kill myself rather than learn who was the first murderer. I could have cared less.  The second episode was better, but I kept wondering why Sergent Pascoe continued to deal with his old college girlfriend when she had such disdain for police.  And then, episode 3 begins with him marrying her!  Maybe I should have read the books, but the characters were poor sketches and their actions didn't always make sense.  They also seem very dated.

While Dalzeil was being honest when he said he was vulgar, drank too much, smoked too much, picked his nose and farted longer than biologically possible (or something to that effect)... I didn't think he had to remind the viewer of it every episode.  I find those soliloquies neither literate nor biting.  It is borish.  That is not to say that characters can't be that way; a lot of the characters in the British mystery procedurals are ""flawed"", to say the least.  But in the first three episodes I saw no redeeming qualities in Dalzeil other than the curious fact that he is always impeccably dressed which seems odd for his character.

I tried to give the second season a go because I realized that there were many seasons of this series and there had to be some reason people liked it.  This season begins with Pascoe promoted and his wife pregnant... but I stopped midway through the first episode.  I had enough.

I won't say I hated it, but I sure was not a fan.  As the English say, ""Just not my cup of tea"".  Anyone want to buy an unopened copy of season 3?  (Just kidding, Amazon!)",1435017600,3,2073,4.422163588390501

4007993,5,B002WN8IS4,"Dalziel & Pascoe, Set 1. 1996-2001.  This television series, made by Britain's ITV, ran for 11 seasons in the United Kingdom. The British mysteries ran on various stations in the United States: A & E, PBS and BBCAmerica.  In this current day, Yorkshire-based police procedural, we meet Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel, (a Scottish name, pronounced Di-el), and his Detective Inspector, Peter Pascoe.  Aside from their unusual methods, detectives Dalziel and Pascoe have nothing in common: Dalziel, the loudmouthed copper, with deplorable manners;  Pascoe, the genteel university-educated fast-tracked police officer.  However, together, they do bond, and manage to crack Yorkshire's most obstinate murder cases.

The series was based upon the crime novels of the recently deceased British author Reginald Hill, who was noted for setting his work in Yorkshire.  As Dalziel, the series starred the recently deceased Warren Clarke, (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The Lancashire-born Clarke was an actor of presence and versatility , both of which the part of Dalziel showcase; after more than 25 years in supporting roles, he finally turned his wide-shouldered, robust appearance and lived-in, hangdog facial features into an asset in this show, which he carried manfully.  The handsome Colin Buchanan gives us Detective Inspector Pascoe.

There was also notable talent behind the cameras: screenplays were written by the greatly esteemed Alan Plater, (THE LAST OF THE BLONDE BOMBSHELLS, THE BEIDERBECKE AFFAIR, OLIVER'S TRAVELS), and the witty Malcolm Bradbury, (THE HISTORY MAN, COLD COMFORT FARM), among others. Series music was by Barrington Pheloung, greatly admired for his work on MORSE. The set consists of three mysteries on two discs, and comes with subtitles.  The episodes are:

Disc 1
A Clubbable Woman.  A rugby player's wife is murdered.
An Advancement of Learning.  The body of a university president turns up on campus, five years after she was supposedly killed abroad.  Prunella Scales, (FAWLTY TOWERS) turns in a delicious guest starring turn.

Disc 2. An Autumn Shroud. An upper-crust family seems to be at the heart of a number of fatal accidents.  The ever beautiful Francesca Annis, (LILLIE, RECKLESS, CRANFORD), guest stars, and gives Dalziel a love interest, in this feature-length crime drama.

I always loved this series and followed it wherever I could find it.  Dalziel is deliciously crude and snide.  The stories, I believe, are fairly true to the novels, if less bawdy and preserve much of their dark Northern humor. Scenery is pungent, acting and direction are fine, scripts are literate, tight, unusual and intriguing.  Very enjoyable.",1426204800,2,2663,5.4330900243309

4008004,5,B002WN8IS4,"I totally enjoyed season 1 and have also just completed with series 2. These are great mystery's with lots of local color and character studies to enhance the various plots. Often there are stories within stories and viewing the series requires close attention to detail to keep all of the events and evidence in prospective. I was particularly pleased to have English sub titles. The heavy York accent was a bit difficult to handle at times. Interesting in that many of the words are spelled phonetically, OWT for Out, etc. If there is any criticism of the series it would be that the episodes, at times, are a bit long and drawn out. But this issue is not significant enough to take anything away from the excellent series. I have purchased all seasons and pre ordered season 9. Dalziel and Pascoe are fast becoming old friends and I always look forward to a new episode.",1395187200,,873,4.638709677419355
4008015,4,B002WN8IS4,"Certainly, it is true, that the British did not invent the detective story. The American, Poe. is generally credited with that honor (although, I am sure that one or another student of the genre will have proposed other candidates), but the British have never been behind in quality or quantity of superior representatives in print, on the air and in television. I really do not feel qualified to judge their film production (aside from the Pre-Hollywood Hitchcocks), so I dismiss the fact that the relatively few detective stories that made it across the Atlantic during the thirties and forties are any better than the majority of American B level movies in the genre. (It should be said that, while not class acts, American stars like Warner Oland (Swedish), Warren William, Ralph Bellamy, George Sanders, and the like made these fun to watch.
At any rate, I understand that this one is well along toward record breaking numbers for seasons being presented, and, based on this first season, it deserves to be available in its native heath as well over  here in the Colonies. No need to compare with Frost, Morse (and Lewis), nor the creations from the works of Christie, Sayers, Allingham, Marsh, and many others contemporary and past. Their virtue is in their individuality. In this one, an ill-suited pair, the  egregious Sgt. Dalziel and his second, educated and refine Pascoe, face up to life in the streets. One can admire the abilities Dalziel but not him. In his young assistant officer, (in this first season) we get only the beginnings of what is going to evolve (I should think) into a sturdy partner. Their problems are those of the street, high and low,  their task, to handle these in an interesting way without the latitude of the private investigator or amateur. These first episodes have their weaknesses but they are interesting and entertaining. For fellow Americans: a comment on understanding the speech. It doesn't earn an A but is a good C. That is to say, the two leads are almost invariably clear as to the meaning of what they say; the rich assortment of characters with whom they deal are often impenetrable. On the whole, however, I was able to follow the general direction of the plot with some things forever murky. i  recommend this to the fans of the British police procedurals which have generally done so well over here.",1382659200,,2356,4.824257425742574

4008025,5,B002WN8IS4,"Andy Dalziel: ""I'm a growing lad. I need fettling"" (Hill 2008:97). The Yorkshire ""thee, thine, tha, yon, owt, nowt, nay, aye, mebbe,"" among other forms of local dialect, add delicious flavor to Reginald Hill's mysteries featuring Dalziel and Pascoe. Those enamored of ""chocolate-box"" mystery confections may also appreciate the salt-of-the-earth qualities of Detective Superintendent Inspector Andy Dalziel. He's a Borgnine kinda guy, a chewy as the yeast in your bottle-conditioned ale. Though this isn't Midsomer County, Barnaby & Jones, ironically, the body-count in Mid-Yorkshire isn't as high as Midsomer's. Fans appreciate the low-brow toughness of Dalziel. I happen to love the Yorkshire setting, and have read all of Reginald Hill's wonderful, erudite mysteries in the Dalziel & Pascoe series. Warren Clarke is fun as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel, and Colin Buchanan is the perfect foil as Detective Inspector Peter Pascoe. ""With Pasco, a little visual horror went a long way. He'd tried everything from vacuous jocularity to Vedic mantras, but such sights [a corpse] still affected him deeply and later almost invariably replayed themselves on that inward eye which can be the bane of solitude"" (Hill 2008:195). David Royle is perfect as Detective Sergeant Wield. Regarding Wieldy, Andy Dalziel says, ""if yon's the first face you see on the morning, you don't need Jeeves's fancy hangover cure"" (Hill 2008:166).

A Clubbable Woman: This adaptation actually improves on the book, the first and weakest in the series. Along with Dalziel, I love rugby union. Things go dangerously amiss when a randy woman is allowed into the rugby club. The maddening thing with this disk/mystery, is there appears to be a manufacturer's flaw towards the end, where it says ""After Three Months"" the disk may freeze. Other reviewers have commented on this problem.

An Advancement of Learning: Detective Superintendent Dalziel is beset by radical feminists, gossip, and spoiled, vain students at Holm Coltram University, where his partner Peter Pasco encounters his old love, Ellie.

An Autumn Shroud: The foggy, soggy, fen-like environs of Lincolnshire shroud a great house in mystery. A stranded Dalziel first sees the enticing widow Bonnie Fielding (the beautiful Francesca Annis, a woman worthy of our Andy's rich and abundant attentions) whilst she drifts in becoming black to her husband's funeral. Several demises and robust encounters follow. An excellent adaption by Malcolm Bradbury.",1334707200,12,2491,5.481770833333333

Amazon did a very prompt and simple replacement and we had our new copy within one week.  The replacement proved defective at the exact same place.  We confirmed the problem using two additional DVD players -- this is a manufacturing defect.

BBC should have caught this defective lot before distribution -- there is no excuse for this from a major media producer.  It is particularly egregious to encounter a play defect right in the middle of the denouement scenes of a mystery story!

4008028,3,B002WN8IS4,"Both of the lead characters are interesting and do a good job of advancing the storyline; the supporting roles and settings are also effective so I suppose my biggest problem is with the writing and directing; the stories are rather dark, depraved and depressing. There is an unnecessary emphasis on the sexual activities of the characters which may or may not really contribute to the progress of the story.

As a result I find I did not enjoy this series nearly so much as some other British detective mysteries and certainly cannot recommend it for the family; this is not a series for children to be specific.

I would strongly suggest watching this one before you buy as it has very polarizing elements in it. It is unlikely I will watch it again.",1320796800,4,752,4.646616541353383
4008029,5,B002WN8IS4,"Just for the record, the chief protagonist's name is pronounced [Di:el].  He's a Scot and he regularly makes the point that this is his name's proper pronunciation.  Set in a fictional town in Yorkshire, Dalziel is a Detective Superintendent, Pascoe a soon-to-be-promoted Detective Inspector.  The latter is married to a spicy, aspiring novelist/teacher with a taste for left-leaning causes as well as her husband, Peter, whose detective work she tolerates and even indulges in herself, on occasion.

The center of the stories, however, is Dalziel, `the fat man', `the big man', but mostly the very, very clever man.  The center of the central character is his wit, expressed in memorable phrases.  He is like a battle-hardened Army sergeant, who has an expression for every occasion.  Pascoe is his straight man--with more formal education but far fewer street smarts.

The cases are interesting, with a bit more sex and violence than on, e.g. Midsomer Murders, but less grittiness than in, e.g. Trial and Retribution or Waking the Dead.  The production values are strong, the plots tight, the local color rich.

It is not fair to say that Dalziel is the `whole show', but it is difficult to imagine the show working without him.  Warren Clarke plays him beautifully.  A character actor with a great range, you see his edgy violence in the role of Dim in A Clockwork Orange and his utter sweetness playing Vic Wilcox in the BBC production of David Lodge's novel, Nice Work.  The tartness and sweetness are both on display here and he clearly relishes this role.

4008031,4,B002WN8IS4,"I for one love English mysteries and English Detectives in particular. A friend recommended this series to me. Set in Yorkshire, 'Dalziel and Pascoe gives us the usual mismatched partners.

Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel and pronounced 'Dee-AL', played by Warren Clarke, is a domineering working man presence. In fact he is so belligerent and arrogant that he can be off-putting and unlikeable. He loves to make off color remarks to those he speaks to, just to catch them off guard. He is paired with Peter Pascoe, played by Colin Buchanan. Pascoe is just the right mix of the college educated, polite and charming,English man, with that funny little smile in the corners of his mouth. Pascoe is right for Andy- smart but needs a lot of mentoring and willing to work as much as necessary. They work off each other so well. A likeable pair, Andy does all the talking and Peter does most of the work.

The three murder mysteries in this set are just OK.  The first, 'A Clubbable Woman,' is set in the halls of the Wetherton Rugby Club. It is an interesting mystery, but one that easily solved. 'An Advancement in Learning' has the pair investigating a murder at the small university where Peter's girlfriend. Ellie teaches. There are stuffy professors and whipper snapped students. You can imagine how Dalziel reacts with both. The third mystery, 'An Autumn Shroud' is the least believable, but its story, with Dalziel stranded in a country home where a murder takes place, is the entertaining. What I really enjoy about these older series is finding guest stars I know from other series or shows.

This series grows on you. Dalziel can be so out of touch at times that he seems remote, but he is so funny and so outrageous that he is lovable. Pascoe is the kid brother that you want to do well, and I found myself cheering him on.

What I want to know is how did the names Dalziel and Pascoe come to be? Where did the writer come up with this idea.

4008032,4,B002WN8IS4,"Warren Clarke is watchable as always. As Andy Dalziel, he makes the point that being huggable is NOT a prerequisite for good detective work. Pascoe is bewildered - by his boss and by his ex - but senses rewards are afoot if he can but endure. Great to have this available -- where are the remainder of the episodes?",1299196800,,315,4.3559322033898304
4008033,5,B002WN8IS4,I got these episodes because I like the books so much - the show is great and I enjoyed watching these episodes. I am going to be buying the rest of the series.,1298505600,,160,3.878787878787879
4008034,4,B002WN8IS4,"The first season is now available on region one dvd,and that's great there's now a total of ten? more seasons to come hopefully. This show has decent engaging detective stories and this first series takes place back in 96 when still many people didn't have cellphones yet. (it was shot that year too).  I can't say that this is as great as 'waking the dead' series but it's a good series that was extremely popular in the UK. few series over there make it past three years, this one lasted 11.  The acting is not bad as one person stated; in fact the guy who plays Daziel has been a highly acclaimed actor for many years before he even did this show.  The location too is not london but farther out in the english countryside so it has a slower pace. This is rural U.K. and not big city action.
Each story is around two hours long where most brit detective shows are an hour to an  hour and a  half.  So you have three 2 hour movies here to watch.
The interplay between the cynical Daziel and the highly educated Pascoe make for a good show too. At this stage Pascoe is ready to get married. If you enjoy detective murder msytery shows that focus on characterization heavily then you'll enjoy this one. It's also NOT a forensic show either, it's a story driven detective show.
You have to have patience with this one or else forget it.",1276819200,,1335,4.341365461847389

4008046,5,B002WN8IS4,"This is a rather hidden gem in the British detectives genre (Frost, Morse, etc), with all sorts of sly winks at those perennial British obsessions with class and region. And, as usual, great whodunnits and impeccable production that puts crank 'em out American TV to shame.

More's the pity that BBC has only released the first of (as I recall) four seasons. Wake up, BBC!",1274918400,,372,4.723076923076923
4008047,5,B002WN8IS4,"A quality DVD set for a quality television series. I'd forgotten how wonderfully written and acted this series was. I can't wait for the BBC to record the following six years of Dalziel and Pascoe for their American audience, so I've ordered an All Region DVD Player  from Amazon along with English and Dutch  DVDs to complete the series.

4008050,4,B002WN8IS4,"This box of three films is the first in a series of a standard police detective procedural set in a Yorkshire city in the north of England. The Detective Superintendent is a Scotsman of working class background with Yorkshire inflections in his scottish accent. Dalziel is an old Scottish name, pronounced Dee-el, and the ignorance of the average Englishman to know this is a source of irritation to Dalziel. He is bulky, Bulldog-faced, and a blunt, outspoken almost bullying character. His detective sargeant is an average middle class fellow presumably from the south who is a university graduate and who speaks received prounciation (with no noticeable class or regional accent). He is polite, well-groomed and mild to the point of being underspoken. If this duo sounds a bit like Laurel & Hardy, I guess that would be fair.

So the scene is set for a series of the usual murders with the investigating police solving the whodunnit. The edge in the inevitable comparison against all the other series is obviously the inter-relationship between the two main characters. The first episode, in effect the pilot, works hard, and rather clumsily to establish the characters and overdoes it in a way that suggests this might be a first effort by the screenplay and script writer(s). Dalziel cannot really be so awfully uncouth and insensitive (I expected him to fart in church), nor his high IQ graduate sargeant so passive and accepting of the abuse (I expected him to raise his hand and ask, permission to speak, sir?). The regional dialects and accents are bewildering and if like me you are slightly hard of hearing you'll miss a lot. So we watch this with the English sub-titles on! That being said, the first episode is not bad, but it does suffer from working too hard.

The second episode works much better, although Dalziel is still working a bit hard at being the bullying oaf who scratches his backside and picks his nose. But it is the third episode that demonstrates that the writers and the actors have settled into the characters - in fact the characters have assumed their own lives and have taken over, much as Morse did, and Barnaby, and Frost. Dalziel is clearly the central figure, much more sensitive and intelligent than he seemed in the beginning. I guess Pascoe will gradually emerge as a key character as well, he and the series deserve it. The policy of having top quality actors in the roles of villains or central characters interfacing with Dalziel (as the Morse series did to very successful effect) is standard casting strategy, but does add a real quality dimension. The series needs it to keep a balance between the larger-than-life Detective Superintendent and his protagonists.

The series is very successful in the UK and has been running for more than six years so far. This first US-release set, containing only three (admittedly full-length) episodes, is probably out to test the North American market. I'd guess it is touch and go whether the producers of the US edition continue with converting the rest, but I do hope so. No doubt it will be a one-a-year policy and we'll all get frustrated waiting. If you're a fan of the British detective genre, you'll find this as good as they get - once you get past the initial character-establishing and learn to understand the way they talk! I rated it a four star because of these points, but I'm sure it will grow into another five star series.",1272153600,3,3426,4.813242784380305
4008051,4,B002WN8IS4,"If you are a Reginald Hill fan then you will like these three episodes.  Even though I am a Brit I found that I could not catch all that was said and I had to put the captions on

I have been addicted to Reginald Hill works mostly for the dialog I admit.  The actor Warren Clarke who plays Dalziel is perfect for the part, in fact I now put his face on Dalziel when reading Hill's books",1271980800,,386,3.923076923076923
4008052,5,B002WN8IS4,"I own just about every British mystery made in the last 20 years and finally, someone had enough sense to bring Dalziel & Pascoe to DVD.  Way too long in coming.  However, with the Northern accent, it is somewhat difficult to understand, which is why I have to watch them 3-4 times to get all the nuance of the British dialect.

Great fun as a mystery.  Hope they keep coming will all series over the next couple of years.",1271462400,,422,4.30379746835443
4008053,5,B002WN8IS4,"There are so many delightful flashing light dramas from the BBC that one more shouldn't make a difference, but if you have been waiting for Mr. D-L to arrive in America this is a red letter day. Dalziel and Pascoe had a brief run on A & E back when A & E actually wanted to bring something new and different to the air waves, instead of recycled crap. It took only one look to hook me, Fat Andy dug in and wouldn't let go and for the last dozen years I have searched impatiently for a DVD formatted for use on North American DVDs. And now it has come. The series is standard television material, an experienced, journeyman police superintendant takes a college educated sargeant under his wing and tries to mature the lad before the villians can kill him. And that is where standard ends. Pascoe fades almost as soon as the camera rolls and Andrew Dalziel steps to the fore front. He's rude, vulgar, loud, and tasteless and completely charming and one hard-nosed, brass-plated copper. There are only three episode on this release and with any other series that would be a shame, but the quality of Dalziel and Pascoe is such that three great episodes only whet the desire for more. The last episode in the set, with Francesca Anis, is both touching and thrilling and amazingly enough our English pals believe that sex does not end with middle-age. So do yourself a favor, buy the disc, buy one for your friends, buy one for Mother's Day, buy one for the office Christmas party gift exchange and maybe we can convince those folks to release more discs. Fat Andy never fails and the only thing better than this set would be the remaining fournteen years of episodes.",1270598400,9,1664,4.53156146179402
4008054,1,B002WN8IS4,"This episode is based on Hill's first, rather short novel and the main characters are supposed to
correspond with the characters in the book. Don't respond to this review by saying this is a t.v. movie, not a novel and there is a world of difference. I agree but this t.v. movie on its own is confusing, choppy, rushed etc. Daziel, for example, is supposed to be a tough, damn everybody, vulgar cop, and several comments by him and his rubbing his privates kind of suggest this type of character, but overall he comes across as more polished than grubby--he wears really nice clothes and the adaptor can't seem to know what to do with his personality and his philosophy of life and police work. He is supposed to contrast strikingly with the university grad and all around smart fellow, Pascoe. But his vocabulary and intellectual knowledge don't create a relationship based on differences. I do believ, however, that the worst problem with A Clubbable Woman is the slipshod direction and story telling that leaves the viewer totally unmoved. It may be possible to tell this story in 90 minutes, but only if viewers know the back story of Ellie, Sgt. Wield, and Daziel. I was looking forward to this film, but was incredibly disappointed. Why do this piece of fiction, if you're not going to do something at least half good? Compare with Midsomer Mystery, Morse, The Sandbaggers, and Foyle's War. A totally unwatchable mishmash of mush.",1270512000,6,1436,4.794354838709677

8383336,5,B002WN8IS4,"I purchased this DVD used from Amazon.com.  It is a faithful presentation of author Reginald Hills police procedural novels set in Yorkshire, England in the modern era.  This set of two discs consists of three episodes representing three of the authors novels: A Clubbable Woman, An Advancement of Learning, and An April Shroud.  I have read all of the authors Dalziel & Pascoe novels, and I have reviewed all of them.  I found that, so far, my reviews of the DVDs matches my reviews of the novels.

The screenplay faithfully reflects the authors writings, and the acting is superb.  The cinematics are gorgeous.  The dialogue is realistic, although it would help most American viewers to turn on subtitles, and learn a little about the slang terminology used in the vicinity of Yorkshire.  Still, I had little trouble understanding what was taking place.

Both of the first two episodes (A Clubbable Woman, and  An Advancement of Learning) are five-star performances, just like the original novels.  An April Shroud, on the other hand, is not nearly as good.  Neither was the novel.  I rated it only three stars.  Still pretty good, but not as good as the other two episodes.

These are really well done TV shows.  They are highly entertaining, and represent some of the highest quality video produced by the BBC.  I highly recommend Season 1 of the Dalziel & Pascoe TV Series DVDs.",1513209600,,1383,4.8418803418803416
