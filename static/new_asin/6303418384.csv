I found it to be an exciting thrill ride, even in it's slightly hokey plot. I like Linda Purl in her character, and the rest of the acting was pretty good! I wonder why this has never been on DVD? I would snap it up in a heartbeat!",1301011200,,335,3.9411764705882355

Incident at Deception Ridge is a movie to keep you guessing at each turn.  When the movie starts, you think one thing is gong to happen, and something totally different happens.  Ian Tracy, Michael O'Keefe and Linda Purl do a great job portraying the characters in this movie.",1071532800,,386,4.5
