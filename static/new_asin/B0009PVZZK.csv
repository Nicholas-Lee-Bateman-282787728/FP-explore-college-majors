2311380,5,B0009PVZZK,"The journey continues for Mugen, Jin and Fuu as they reunite after the fight in episode 15.  They meet a falsely accused man on the run from the law, a group of avid Graffiti taggers, an underground Christian cult, and a blind, wandering musician as they get closer to their destination.  Fuu finally confides the truth of the Sunflower Samurai's identity to Mugen and Jin, as well as discovers a secret of his past and a tentative identity.  The best single episode of the entire series is on this disc, ""War of the Words,"" in which Mugen learns how to read from a hard-drinking teacher as tough as he is, a hilarious parody of Andy Warhol shows up, and Mugen is credited with inventing the Infinity symbol as his own tag (?).  This series has always had a creative and ingenious sense of anachronism, but it's perfected here.  Whether viewed as a samurai comedy or a spectacular action series, this is one of the best anime to come out in years.",1130803200,2,947,4.514619883040936
2311381,5,B0009PVZZK,"I remember the first time I saw the preview for this series and not being able to wait in anticipation for it to reach the stores.  Well it's now beyond the half-way point of Samurai Champloo and I can safely say that series lived up to all the anticipation.

  Case in point?  Well the episode about graffiti tagging mentioned in the Amazon review is absolutely perfect when it comes to exemplifying what this show has to offer its viewers in terms of adventure, humour, and a sense of play when it comes to historical fact.  The music is incredible and it amazingly seems to fit right into the setting of the show despite the centuries of time difference.

  Bottom line: we are getting closer to finding out about Fuu's quarry and coming to a conclusion to this story.  That's a pity because it's not that often a series comes along that succeeds in so many aspects.",1128902400,,869,4.512820512820513
2311382,5,B0009PVZZK,"Forget what the guy above me said, this is one of my favorite animes today with the crazy samurai action and hiphop music, it applies a nice finish. With the limited samurai action today this is one you should check out. If you a fan of samurai action, hiphop music or good anime this is for you.",1126569600,20,296,4.2105263157894735

8065118,4,B0009PVZZK,"This is some of the best Samurai Champloo all on this disk.

Lullabies of the Lost Verse 2 an end to a special pair of episodes.

War of the Words; This is one of the Best Episodes I have seen, Where Mugen learns to read by a rather caring teacher.

Unholy Union An interesting, yet touchy subject on religion. I may sound a bit mean, but the enemy at the end got his comeuppance. Good riddance.

Elegy of Entrapment Verse 1 I watch this particular episode a lot, as I love the Shamisen music. I have been drawn to the beautiful, yet sad music. I recommend you get Vol 6 if you want to see what happens,
I'm planning to get Vol 6 Soon.

All in all, this is a great disc, one to be enjoyed by Anime Fans.",1372204800,,703,4.028776978417266

8065120,5,B0009PVZZK,"A very strong volume....No episodes that I didn't like.

#17 Lullibies of the Lost Verse 2: Interesting episode that finishes off the vol. 4 cliffhanger nicely. Great fight scenes, Great story, Good to see Mugen, Jin, and Fuu come back together.

#18 War of the Words: Hillarious-ass samurai tagging episode, Great art work on the tagging, Great side story with Mugen learning to read, a very strong episode in my opinion. Probably the most rewatchable on the disc.

#19 Unholy Union: Alright episode, we find out who the Sunflower Samurai really is even though I expected who he was, hardly any fight scenes, boring at times, but still a vital part of the series.

#20 Elegy of Entrapment Verse 1: A cliffhanger that that left me wanting more: I can understand Japanese people might like Sara's singing but it is hard to listen to for me, No fight scenes until the very end and that's when it really gets good, some romance between Sara and Mugen, an-important-but-kind-of-boring-until-the-end-episode.",1142899200,2,1003,4.9880239520958085
8065121,5,B0009PVZZK,"what can i say. i know. if God would watch TV this would be a must watch show.  samurai champloo is a masterpiece. its hilarious, emotional, intensifying, everything and most important adults as well as teenagers can watch this without any complaints about it. all i got to say is this. You have to watch this series before you die. oh and excuse my grammar mistakes",1138752000,2,366,4.545454545454546
8065122,5,B0009PVZZK,"the fifth installment of samurai champloo has proven, like the volumes before it, that good things come to those who wait. with masterful artwork, great music and action-packed scenes, samurai champloo has kept the industry alive. below are my ratings for the four episodes on this volume.

episode seventeen: lullabies of the lost verse2- the fans that watched volume four have been waiting for this episode: it finishes what volume four left unfinished. this episode reveals the fate of our heroes and if their fate brings them together again.

i rate this episode a 10/10. great episode nomatter how many times i watch it.

episode eighteen: war of the words- mugen is illiterate! as mugen finally comes to terms with this, fuu tries to fend off two crazy boys with the hots for her! and amidst this commotion, visits a grave of a man he had great respect for.

i rate this episode 9/10

episode nineteen: unholy union- jin, mugen and fuu discover a fraud involving selling weaponry and the underground christians. intrigued? guess you gottta watch it! good episode.

i rate this episode a 7/10. it was quite funny, but there was less action and less plot compared to other episodes. still, a good thirty minutes.

episode twenty: elegy of entrapment verse1- it's happened again! this episode is one part of a two part episode on the end of this dvd. that means we are to be cliffhung once again. still, this is a really good episode.

i rate this episode a 10/10.

well, thats it for this review. check out my others for this series.",1137283200,2,1537,4.726591760299626
8065123,4,B0009PVZZK,"As the local authorities and Mugen search for the mysterious Okuru, who by the way is looking after Fuu, Jin must face a samurai out to avenge his master's death. It seems Jin killed him. This was an interesting episode, seeing as it dealt with the Ainu, the original inhabitants of Japan. Much as the Europeans pushed the Indians into extinction, so too did these natives go. The next two episodes are more lightweight, with varying results. In ""War of the Words"" we find out that Mugen is illiterate. He seems proud of the fact that he only knows one letter! That's when a school teacher grabs him in a headlock to teach him his ABC's! ""Unholy Union"" shows Europeans in a bad light as a corrupt priest uses his Christian followers to smuggle guns and his power to force himself on a woman. The last episode injects some romance into the fold as a blind musician joins our group on the road. It seems that Mugen is taken with her, and little did we know that Fuu is nursing a secret love, but for whom?

This was a great volume, except for the European Christian thing. It just didn't work for me. The guy was cross-eyed and had the biggest nose you've ever seen, and his accent was very annoying, worse than a yakuza! The comedy of the graffitti episode was very well done. There's nothing like seeing Mugen being beaten by a drunk schoolteacher! With the addition of Sara, the blind shamisen, we finally get a strong woman character that can hold her own with the two guys. Excellent music.

Features a promo video and some conceptual art.",1133136000,,1542,4.503571428571429
