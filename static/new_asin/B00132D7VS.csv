3101257,5,B00132D7VS,"I purchased a Walk to Remember to show my students at the detention center at which I teach. The girls are 12-17 yrs. of age and incarcerated, receiving their education daily at the center. They were riveted to the movie and could identify with the characters. I highly recommend the movie for teen girls. It fit right into what I was teaching them in Life Skills class about a person's ability to change at any age.",1278892800,5,416,4.4868421052631575
3101258,4,B00132D7VS,"I am a 24-year-old guy.  I doubt these movies were designed with me in mind.  Not that guys can't enjoy chick flicks, or whatever the politically-correct term is for movies that women tend to enjoy more than men.  But ""A Walk To Remember"" and ""Pay It Forward"" want you to cry, and they want you to CRY HARD!

Sometimes to get emotional, we gotta let a movie manipulate us a little.  Not too much, but a little nudge in the soft direction ain't too bad.  I once read that, ""We are who we bring with us to the movie, and all we can do is describe what happened to us when we left.""

Well, ""A Walk To Remember"" was a charming little romance with a little cheese on the side.  I found ""Pay It Forward"" to be a little too much in its final stretch, but you can't deny its sadness.

""A Walk To Remember"" is the story of how a troublemaking teenager is forced to help students with learning disabilities as a discipline.  Soon, he meets another tutor, a pastor's daughter.  The two begin have a kind but dismissive relationship, until eventually the two start developing feelings for one another.  I won't spoil what sad event causes the whole movie to take a turn, but it's a romantic movie, and appropriate for families too.

""Pay It Forward"" takes a much darker angle to stir our emotions.  The main plot portrays how a young student --- for a class assignment --- comes up with an idea to make the world a nicer place.  He suggests that if 1 person did 3 good deeds, and then the people they helped did 3 more of their own, it could change the world.  While this is an optimistic message (and a meaningful one), ""Pay It Forward"" takes some intense turns.  Almost everyone in the movie is a victim of some sort of abuse or misfortune.  Several fathers are revealed as disturbingly violent, a couple mothers are absent, a teacher is disfigured, and one poor kid is constantly bullied to the point of being murdered.  Kinda heavy stuff.  The movie has a positive message, but it saddens the hell out of you before it gets there.  The performances are terrific, but I think most will feel uneasy or toyed with rather than inspired.

I recommend getting this double-pack because ""A Walk To Remember"" is a good, solid movie.  But if you want another tear-jerker, ""Pay It Forward"" will give it to you, whether you want it to or not.",1275696000,22,2322,4.411764705882353

3101262,4,B00132D7VS,"Two very good movies. A Walk to Remember is a sweet romantic story that encourages you appreciate what you have. Pay It Forward is a tear jerker that shares how one person, even a child, can make a difference in the world.

My order was shipped by Friends of Thousand Oaks Library. It came quickly in a normal tan padded envelope. The DVD was new and manufacturer wrapped. However, the back of the case had dings and the bar code area was all cut up. It doesn't affect the quality of the movie but when you buy something ""New"" you don't expect the case to be so damaged before you even get it.",1473379200,,593,4.247787610619469

3101303,5,B00132D7VS,"A walk to Remember is a meaningful story, to give anyone who know that they have a short time to live not stop living. This movie shows you, that you can do many things before you are in the later stages of your illness. If you have plan to do something meaningful in your life like getting married or climb the highest mountain you can do it.  Do not take death so serious and live and be all you can be.  The songs in this movie are great and you will learn them as I did.  If you can dream you can live out whatever you want to .  Do not feel sorry for yourself and keep it moving.  I watch this movie when I get down but it gives you the know how to get out of it.  The characters are great and the ending will show how someone else can become strong from watching you go through your illness without fear.  This has a very positive affect on anyone who watches this movie.  I know you will love this one also.  Chatou",1386288000,,922,3.967391304347826

3101307,5,B00132D7VS,"This is a true love story, and although I am not a great lover of love stories per say, this one includes a family, a way of life and people making commitments. Lovely.
Of course Pay It Forward is also a wonderful movie that can change your way of thinking about life and how to help people.
Definitely worth watching. Also, both are good for the family too, although there is an adult theme in A walk to remember. If  parents are watching with children they can address the issues that come up in the movie.",1375574400,,508,4.291666666666667

""A Walk To Remember"" is the story of how a troublemaking teenager is forced to help students with learning disabilities as a discipline.  Soon, he meets another tutor, a pastor's daughter.

The movie has a positive message, but it saddens the hell out of you before it gets there.  The performances are terrific, but I think most will feel uneasy or toyed with rather than inspired.

I recommend getting this double-pack because ""A Walk To Remember"" is a good, solid movie.  But if you want another tear-jerker, ""Pay It Forward"" will give it to you, whether you want it to or not.",1275696000,22,2322,4.411764705882353

My order was shipped by Friends of Thousand Oaks Library. It came quickly in a normal tan padded envelope. The DVD was new and manufacturer wrapped. However, the back of the case had dings and the bar code area was all cut up. It doesn't affect the quality of the movie but when you buy something ""New"" you don't expect the case to be so damaged before you even get it.",1473379200,,593,4.247787610619469

This movie shows you, that you can do many things before you are in the later stages of your illness. If you have plan to do something meaningful in your life like getting married or climb the highest mountain you can do it.  Do not take death so serious and live and be all you can be.  The songs in this movie are great and you will learn them as I did.  If you can dream you can live out whatever you want to .  Do not feel sorry for yourself and keep it moving.  I watch this movie when I get down but it gives you the know how to get out of it.  The characters are great and the ending will show how someone else can become strong from watching you go through your illness without fear.
