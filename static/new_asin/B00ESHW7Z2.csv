8608933,5,B00ESHW7Z2,"Wild East Films presents an excellent Klaus Kinski double feature with ""And God Said to Cain"" and less rare ""Twice a Judas"" with excellent transfers for each.  ""And God Said to Cain"" is one of the best spaghetti westerns directed by Anthony Dawson (AKA Antonio Margeriti) with glorious camera work by Luciano Trasatti and Riccardo Pallottini helping to tell the story with great editing by Nella Nannuzzi with music by Carlo Savina.  Co-starring Peter Carsten.  ""Twice a Judas"" with its also ""Biblical"" title is less concise scriptually, but is enthralling nonetheless and holds your attention throughout and co-stars Antonio Sabato directed by Nando Cicero (""Red Blood, Yellow Gold"" and ""Time of Vultures"") before ""Twice a Judas"" marked his exit from directing westerns.  ""And God Said to Cain,"" however, is the superior film.  Both in color, this Wild East double feature is well worth the price paid at popular prices.",1455321600,3,921,5.154362416107382

8608935,4,B00ESHW7Z2,"This latest double feature from Wild East Productions places the greatest Euro Cult actor Klaus Kinski front and center in two stylish Spaghetti Westerns with biblical title references.  Up first is Director Antonio Margheriti's (here billed as Anthony Dawson) 'AND GOD SAID TO CAIN' aka 'E DIO DISSE A CAINO'-1969,  a gothic revenge western resembling many of Margheriti's Horror films of that period.  Kinski plays Gary Hudson , a good guy for once in this outing, wrongfully sent to prison but gets a surprise pardon from the President.  This does not sit well for the real thief and murderer, land baron Acombar played by the great character actor Peter Carsten knowing full well that Hudson will come gunning for revenge.  The entire film takes place in real time as Kinski is released in the morning and by night fall, culminates his gun battle.  Although the meager plot by Margheriti and Producer Giovanni Addessi slowly unfolds, it is worth it for the films brilliantly staged climactic gun duel taking place in a room full of mirrors during a conflaguration of flames engulfing both Kinski and Carsten's characters posing as a slight hommage to Director Orson Welles 'THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI'- 1947. With gorgeously photographed images by Margheriti's favorite cameraman Riccardo Pallottini aided by Luciano Trasatti and a nice music score by Carlo Savina peppered with J.S Bach organ Fugues to boost the gothic tones, it highlights Kinski's iconic facial image throughout.  Fairing less is the second outing, Director Nando Cicero's 'TWICE A JUDAS' aka 'DUE VOLTE GUIDA' aka 'THEY WERE CALLED GRAVEYARD'-1968 where here we see Kinski in psuedo villainous attire as a slimy land baron who is traffiking illegal immigrants across the Mexican border to toil on  land which he so meticulously stole from the desolate farmers who can't pay their mounting debts. Euro actor Antonio Sabato plays Kinski's brother who is suffering from amnesia from an ambush plotted by Kinski and takes the film's entire running time to regain his identity and to enact his revenge.  Spaghetti fans will spot actor Jose Calvo (here billed as Pepe Calvo), the barkeeper who aids Clint Eastwood in Director Sergio Leone's 'A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS' aka 'PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI'-1964  as the brothers Yoda-like mentor. Director Cicero would go on to direct two more westerns both with actor George Hilton ( 'TIME OF VULTURES' aka 'IL TEMPO DEGLI AVVOLTOI'-1967 and the excellent 'RED BLOOD YELLOW GOLD' aka 'PROFESSIONISTI PER UN MASSACRO'-1968)  before abandoning the genre. The film boasts nice cinematography by non other than the great Aristide Massaccesi here billed as Joe D'Amato aided by Francisco Marin and an adequate music score by Carlo Pes.  Each film gets the usual Wild East treatment:  Excellent print quality for both in their original 2.35 wide screen ratios but are English dubbed ( 'JUDAS' has its main titles in Italian and a 60 second sequence at the climax subtitled in Italian), picture galleries and Italian /German trailers for each film.  Not Kinski's best western roles (fans should seek out Director Sergio Corbucci's 'THE GREAT SILENCE' aka 'IL GRANDE SILENZIO'-1968 for that one), they do, however, make for grand western entertainment and are highly recommended.",1379376000,12,3274,5.152830188679245
