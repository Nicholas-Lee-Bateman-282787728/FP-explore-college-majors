8730441,1,B014E1TLIM,"The voice acting really sucked on this.  I saw the first one, and they mistakenly recast the main voices.  You can throw glitter on a piece of sh! t, but it's still sh! t.",1469232000,,171,4.0
8730442,1,B014E1TLIM,"Positive:
1. The CGI was good by most standards although easily accomplished with present day computers.
Negatives:
1. Poorly written, disjointed and hard to follow even for older viewers let alone younger ones. A fragmented hodgepodge of stereotypic misadventures mostly on the troll like creature. Not creative at all.
2. Voicing actors were poorly chosen. Very hard to understand and at times aggravating to listen to. They tried to give the voices some emotion and intelligence by overlaying a lot of monotonous music/sound effects.
3. No subtitles as if dialogue was not important. Even at twice normal volume half of what was being said was not decipherable.",1452902400,2,664,5.214953271028038
