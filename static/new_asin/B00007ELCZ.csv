1807445,5,B00007ELCZ,"I find it sad that reviewers here expect LOSW to compare with Fawlty Towers, Father Ted, or even some of my own favorites, The Young Ones and Bottom.  With the exception that all are in comic veins, LOSW is a different sort of humour.
LOSW is a *quiet* comedy show.  What I love most about the entire run of the series is that it portrays characters who obviously feel they are still the kids they once were.  There is some slapstick comedy, and certainly the aspects of French farce are more involved since the intro. of Howard, Pearl, and Marina, but none of the wild or completely improbable situations of other Britcoms.
The writer of this show continually shows his love for Yorkshire, its strong and very human people, beautiful scenery, and the county's northern community standards.  I love his feel for dialogue, relatioships, and community life.
I'm still waiting for all the seasons to make it over here on VHS or DVD.  I'd love to view the entire run of the series.",1083715200,131,977,4.624277456647399
1807446,1,B00007ELCZ,"If a comedy isn't funny-is it still a comedy?  The episodes in this set are tedious-and what little humor there is, isn't vey funny at all.  The characters are not very amusing or likeable and what little plot there is meanders along at a pace that slows time down to an unbearable level. I am a great fan of Britcoms--but this isn't one I'd recommend.  It could be my own sense of humor--but rating Fawlty Towers as a 10--Black Adder and Father Ted as 9's--One Foot in the Grave and Ab Fab as 8's, Keeping Up Appearances and Vicar of Dibley as 7's etc etc--this show is over rated as a ""1""  Along with ""Allo Allo""--this is one of the two worst Britcoms I've ever seen.  *it could be this show improved with time--as the episodes in this set are the only ones I've seen--and so they are the episodes I specifically refer to",1081728000,11,823,4.318181818181818
1807447,3,B00007ELCZ,"I had no problem at all with the DVD's, however, I was disapointed that the characters I was accustomed to seeing in the daily shows were not on the DVD's. Howard, Nora and others  were missing. The DVD's were not as entertaining.  There was one of the movies, Moving Sam, which was really funny.  I have ordered the new set of DVD's being release as Foggy, Norman and the usual folks will be in them.",1079913600,11,401,4.32
1807448,5,B00007ELCZ,If you are a fan of The Last of the Summer Wine.  You will love this DVD.  It has shows from the second and third seasons.  This DVD also has two movie specials.  They are wonderful to watch.,1058313600,12,191,3.9473684210526314
1807449,3,B00007ELCZ,"First off, I tried two different versions of this DVD set and both were missing the 4th DVD.... so there appears to be some problem on the manufacturing end.
As far as content.... these are the very,very early episodes of the series (actually 2 movies and some episodes), so if you are familiar with those currently run on some USA PBS stations, you may be disappointed. I'd say this set is for those who are true enthusiasts of the series and want to see it from the very start (early 1970's).... and who don't mind taking a chance of only getting 3 out of 4 DVDs.",1050364800,44,565,4.339622641509434
1807470,5,B00007ELCZ,"Probably the most comfortable series I've ever watched (and considering how many series I've watched, that's saying something).

As you watch these old schoolmates, now retired, wander the gorgeous hills around Holmfirth, Yorkshire, England, you slowly get to know them, and eventually you feel that you are right there with them.  You know who's going to fall into the river; who's going to get into trouble with the stern cafe owner; who's going to get a purse bounced off the top of his head; who's going to come up with some wacky idea either to make money, or to better humankind (ha!).

Their shenanigans delight and amuse time and time again.  How I wish I could visit with them for a while in one of their cozy pubs!

1807540,4,B00007ELCZ,"It's a quiet comedy about several old (and presumably retired) men who go on different adventures in the small town they live in.  It avoids slapstick (for the most part), and the characters are stereotypical but credible.

No, it's not for everyone.  It doesn't have the screaming and crass stereotypes of ""Fawlty Towers"" or the weirdness of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" or the craziness of ""Are You Being Served?"".  If that's what you're after, this show doesn't have that.  Maybe it's too mild for some, but everyone has their tastes.",1416700800,2,539,4.944444444444445

1807543,5,B00007ELCZ,"this review is for all last of the summer wine dvds.  when i first watched this show on pbs, i really didn't know what to expect.  for me, it was a slow start and i couldn't ""get"" three senior gentlemen acting like children.  but as the show progressed, i found myself laughing out loud in the room by myself at the absolutely ridiculous and unexpected situations they got themselves into.  each show is well written, wonderfully acted, and photographed.  the scenery is beautiful and so restful.  even the theme song is relaxing.  that's when i decided i had to have these shows in my library.  if you enjoy british humor, these dvds are a must to have in your library.  you will come to love each of the characters in this madcap series.  my goal is to own all of them.  i just wish they came in a complete set like so many others british shows.  campo passing did leave a huge hole that couldn't be filled.

3/12/15 update .... i have reached my goal and own all available dvds.  i purchased them from amazon uk.  i'm anxiously awaiting the release of the last few series.",1410566400,,1075,4.413265306122449

1807552,4,B00007ELCZ,"For American viewers, this may seem just a bit too gentle and unassuming, because it's rather slice of life, with simple, plausible somewhat innocuous plots and sub plots that devolve from English village life lived by three quite definite characters, chums since school, I would imagine.  But the characters drive the conflicts here, and the comedy is simple, with contrasting exaggerations versus subtlety, surprises, and the playing out of aging male prides taking their knocks from village females.  Using an old easy chair for a sleigh ride down a hill; one bloke with an ongoing crush on his outspoken landlady, who doesn't hesitate to lay her broom across his head as he runs away to be rescued by his pals.  All the little ploys we use in daily life to enhance ourselves, are wonderfully played on.  With three or four other friends, all laughed out loud at the plausibility and nonsense, having never seen before scenes of English village life.  Ran for years in the UK on BBC 2.  Wonderful stuff if you enjoy the nuances of human behaviors.",1395964800,2,1050,4.837988826815643

1807554,5,B00007ELCZ,"I cannot say enough good about this show.  I first watched on PBS as I caught Frank Thornton on it.  Then when watching prior years shows fell in love with Sid at Sid's Cafe.  I still miss seeing him in the later episodes.  Bill Owen is simply a man who never really grew up in the roll of Compo.  He even walks like a little boy, wanders all over the area and never in a straight line.  I have over 10 of the DVDs so far and am collecting the rest as I can.",1395878400,,458,3.8191489361702127

1807593,5,B00007ELCZ,"I love, love, love the Last of the Summer Wine programs.

Being a little hard of hearing, especially when it comes to some of the Yorkshire accents, I especially appreciate the subtitles options. I have never been able to decipher the ""closed captions"" feature of my TV or VCR player. With the subtitles option on the discs, I can click ""on"" and then I'm able to understand every word.

I have every Last of the Summer Wine DVD that has been released. I am so excited each time I read about another one on the way.  They are sometimes released first on BBC America's site, but I wait to get the free shipping and much better price here at Amazon.

My only complaint is that all thirty seasons' episodes are not released as one huge collection. I know the Dark Shadows drama was released as a complete series of more than 1,000 episodes. I believe LOTSW has just over 300 episodes.",1363132800,,880,4.447204968944099

If one could only afford one DVD collection, I'd definitely recommend this one (Vintage 1995).  Not only are the episodes provided great but the special 30 Years of Last of the Summer Wine provides an entertaining walk down memory lane.  The special would also work as an introduction to newcomers to the series, as they can see the progression of the show over the years.

I also enjoyed the addition of A Leg Up For Christmas, as only ""the boys"" can make the Season quite so funny and nostalgic at the same time.",1362873600,3,756,4.410071942446043

They were excellent actor and the humor was absolute hilarious. I like English humor much better than American, the characters are more believable, and the quick wit leaves you chuckling.

1807646,5,B00007ELCZ,"Last of the Summer Wine is, of course, one of the best things about TV.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, this '95 release is a particularly good place to start.  It features Foggy in tip top form, I've always liked the older Foggy more than the younger Foggy from the '70's, but he's superb no matter what the age.  OK, enough for the review, here's what you want, Information.

This release will include a ""dizzyingly comical Christmas Special"".  This is the first time this January 1995 ""Special"" ""Man Who Nearly Knew Pavarotti"" has been released commercially in the U.S.  OK, here's the rundown:

The Man Who Nearly Knew Pavrotti - This January 1995 ""Christmas Special"" episode features one of several guest appearances by Norman Wisdom, as bumbler Billy Ingleton. Billy finds a piano, and as it has always been his dream to play professionally, the trio organise a piano recital. But when he's in the spotlight, Billy faints from stage fright. Luckily, Compo has an idea up his sleeve.

The Glory Hole - Foggy sets out to relive his days in World War II, after seeing a holein the road, which made him think of trenches!

Adopted by a Stray - The trio meet a man who is throwing out his van, as he intends to live as a hermit. He happily gives them his van- but they didn't expect his wife to come with it!

The Defeat of the Stoneworm - Howard arranges a secret method of communication with Clegg- tapping through the walls. When Pearl almost catches him in the act, he invents a household pest called stoneworm, and, out of sympathy, the trio attempt to convince people that they exist.

Once in a Moonlit Junkyard - Compo has a visit from a mysterious motorcyclist, who he thinks may be a former acquaintance.

The Space Ace - The trio meet an amateur astronaut. They take him to the local pub, where he gets blind drunk. Whilst he sleeps it off, Foggy decides to organise a new training programme for him.

The Most Powerful Eyeballs in West Yorkshire - Foggy is convinced he has a knack for hypnotherapy, but he goes under himself.

The Dewhirsts of Ogleby Hall - Foggy becomes convinced he is a member of an old aristocratic family.

The Sweet Smell of Excess - Compo uses his bed as a trampoline, but winds up caught in the bed spring. The trio manage to cut him free straight over a sewer, and then have to get rid of the resulting whiff, which prevents them from going anywhere public.

That's it Summer Winers, enjoy.",1346976000,50,2439,4.509090909090909

So, for the seller I give 5 stars, for Amazon I give 0 stars because that misleading review should never have been attached to this product but 5 stars for their great CS.

What lies in-between are 3 stars. If you buy, understand that there may be reviews that are misleading. What IS on these 4 DVDs are (1) a full-length movie titled 'Getting Sam Home' , (2) a full-length special on the show itself and then (3 & 4) 6 shows (3 on each of the 2 remaining discs).

1807678,5,B00007ELCZ,"...that's how I find the series Last of the Summer Wine and that quality I suspect is one of the reasons the series has lasted for so long.  The thirty minute shows are centered around a trio of retired men in the winter of their lives, and with nothing to do but to attempt to recreate their boyhoods.

Centered in a small Yorkshire village, the trio interact daily with a varied cast of geriatric  characters.  It's not slapstick comedy, or societal comedy it's quiet, feel good british humor with the trio; rolling down hills in abandoned tires, trying to jump a small stream without getting wet, breaking a sick friend out of his house away from his wife to visit his girlfriend, chasing a huge balloon of a woman across fields and streams, and helping one of the trio woo the woman of his dreams.  Just a small sample of the picadillos  they find themselves in, the trio is always up to it's eyeballs in scrapes.

The scenery is beautiful and peaceful, the music sweet, and the characters the most loveable you can meet.

Roy Clarke has been writing the thirty minute sitcom for over thirty years and it has yet to reach the point where the characters or show are stale!  It is obviously a labor of love.

My only complaint?  That more of the series is not available on DVD.  If offered I would purchase the entire series.

The three old guys are just little kids in wrinkled bodies, and the poor women in the series are stuck trying to cope with whatever silly idea has moved in next!  It's not cruel or nasty humor, but one that is completely self-deprecating and can be enjoyed as much by a small child as a grandmother or father (in fact, one of my friends watches it with her grandson, and they both enjoy it!).

1807709,3,B00007ELCZ,"Compo (Bill Owen), Clegg (Peter Sallis), and Foggy (Brian Wilde) are the classic trio of elderly delinquents who swan about Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, unbridled from the responsibilities of marriage and employment. In short, they are three retired and widowed or unmarried chaps who have nothing better to do in their golden years than to muck about and cause trouble, much to the chagrin of the lady-folk and envy of the downtrodden husbands.

Foggy did not join the programme until series 3, so in this collection, he only appears on one disc. Still, he is the third man in what many consider the ""classic trio"". This collection revives the original trio from series 1 & 2: Compo, Clegg, and Blamire (Michael Bates), but they still get into lots of mischief.

Now that introductions are out of the way, tell me who organised this collection? The mind boggles when one realises where the episodes are from and how they are arranged.

Disc 1: Getting Sam Home (""feature film"")

Disc 2: Last Of the Summer Wine (""feature film"")

Disc 3: Forked Lightning, Who's That Dancing With Nora Batty Then?, The Changing Face Of Rural Blamire

Disc 4: Spring Fever, The New Mobile Trio, Hail Smiling Morn Or Thereabouts

""Getting Sam Home"", while it is feature-length at about 90 min., is the 1983 Christmas Special following series 7. Compo, Clegg and Foggy have to sneak Sam, fresh from hospital, out of his house from under the nose of his wife Sybil, to the home of his ""lady friend"" Lily Bless 'er, then back again after ""extenuating circumstances"". Nothing says, ""Christmas,"" more, right?

The ""Last Of the Summer Wine"" ""feature film"" is a blatantly misleading title. It is nothing more than the first three episodes of series 1 smooshed together as one. The original episode titles are: ""Short Back & Palais Guide"", Inventor Of the Forty Foot Ferret"", and ""Pat & Chips"". As a result, it is quite confusing as they leap from one story arc to another. (Then again, the UK Playback release of series 1 & 2 does the very same thing. For ""contractual reasons."")

Disc 4 and Disc 3 ought to be shifted round, for Disc 4 contains the second half of series 1. Disc 3 contains the first 3 of the 7 episodes of series 2.

Understand what I mean?

Oh, and one other thing. If you are only familiar with the more recent episodes of Last Of the Summer Wine (anything from the last, say 15, even 20 years), you may be in for a shock. Writer Roy Clarke was still getting a feel for the series (as were the production crew), so the humour and language (and cinematics) is a tad more crude than later stories. In fact, series 1 & 2 earned an overall rating of 12 for the first three episodes (the others are all rated PG, but remember, this is by British standards).",1180396800,26,2744,4.613963039014374

The whole series revolves around the pointless antics of three guys, past their prime, and with more time on their hands than they know what to do with.  The music, the scenery, the characters, and just the general ambience evoke sheer joy and relaxation.  The dialog is superb. I watch an episode or two occasionally on Sunday afternoons when I wish to ""get off"" from the present.

The show reminds me a lot of what I and about four others used to do in our teens just loafing around Bangalore, India.  Of course, in those days Bangalore was truly India's Garden City.  Today it is India's rich concrete jungle.

I stumbled upon this series in the early eighties when our local PBS station (KPBS) used to air it (before the boring Yanni days!).

1807741,5,B00007ELCZ,"i find it amusing that another reviewer from lexington kentucky said a lot that i would say.

lotsw shows up on our pbs station on weekends with other britcoms and that is almost the problem.  wedged in between ""are you being served"" and the antics of hyacinth bucket i like many others i suspect watched about five or ten minutes of this show and headed elsewhere.  i was in a hurry for the fast laughs of almost all britcoms.  one night i could find absolutely nothing else on so i watched--and the next week i watched and now it's my favorite vacation spot.

the pace of the program reflects the pace of the place and its people.  it does not mean they are not funny but the show is not about zingers and one liners.  it's about a beautiful place that in and of itself is worth watching.  it's populated by people who are perhaps a bit odd but it's a small country town isn't it.  for all of the attitude of some of the players there's no real evil or meanness here.  virtually all have a soft underside.  even howard's extra curricular tendancies are more endearing than adulterous.

i must agree with the reviewer who felt he could relax, pour a drink and settle back into a slower simpler place.  if you relax and really watch the show it is an absolute joy.

i fear that one of the differences in americans and brits is the attitude toward age.  shows like this one, ""waiting for god"", ""dad's army"" and even ""as time goes by"" present the attitude that one can still be funny, loving, and worthwhile after 50.  in the u.s. there is little of this excepting ""golden girls"".  that is sad and i applaud our cousins in the u.k. for producing some marvelous television--further--programs that hold up so well over time.",1135900800,48,1720,4.444089456869009

Instead, they substituted one with ""Last of the Summer Wine,"" which I'd not heard of, let alone seen. At first, I didn't like it very much, maybe because I expected it to be like ""Keeping Up Appearances"" (since it's also written by Roy Clarke). But it really grew on me, and I've come to love all of the characters and the leisurely pace of the program. It's a show like nothing else I've seen.

Foggy is the trained killer, Compo is crazy for Nora Batty and, Clegg after his one stint with marriage is afraid of women. This show is addictive and all of the characters are lovable; Edie and her driving techniques and Howard and his bouts with Marina are hilarious. This is truly British Comedy at its best!",1113782400,8,656,4.385245901639344
1807768,5,B00007ELCZ,"Anyone who has ever watched Open All Hours or Keeping Up Appearances will already be familiar with writer Roy Clarke's distinctive brand of humour, and if you've enjoyed the type of humour in either of these two shows, Last of the Summer Wine is certainly worth checking out.  Humour aside, however, this series is somewhat different from the other two.  It's overall a very laidback, gentle series filled with some extremely scenic views of the Yorkshire dales and the loveliest theme music of any Britcom.  One ought not to expect, therefore, to find a powerhouse (like Arkwright or Hyacinth) leading the show (oh, they are here--and in greater numbers than in the BFS boxed set which contains the earliest episodes--but they're relegated to supporting roles!).  Rather, the series revolves around the humorous adolescent antics and ""philosophical"" musings (if one can call it that) of three carefree, lay-about geriatric men.

Most memorable is the tatty, peg-toothed Compo Simonite (Bill Owen, who sadly died at age 85 of pancreatic cancer in 1999--like most, he was with the show till the very end), who's spent his life on the dole, is the most rangy-tang and mischievous of the lot, and is forever dreaming of his neighbour, Nora Batty--wrinkled stockings and all.  Then there is Norman Clegg (Peter Sallis), a man who's terrified of women--which is unfortunate as he is constantly called upon by his neighbour Howard (the epitomy of a hen-pecked husband) to assist Howard in communicating with his ""young lady"" friend, the man-eating Marina.  Lastly is Foggy Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), a humorously regimental (but totally inept) ex-military man, without whom the other two would never do anything and there'd be no show!  Wilde, who left the show for a brief period from 1985-90, retired permanently in 1997.

Though series is still in production after more than 30 years, the years from 1990-1997 (the Howard & Marina/Foggy Dewhurst years) were among the strongest for the series.  This BBC boxed set, subtitled Vintage 1995, falls within that classic era and includes ten 30-minute episodes (the complete second series of episodes to be filmed during 1995) plus the 60-minute Christmas special entitled ""A Leg Up for Christmas.""

Special features include ""30 Years of Last of the Summer Wine"", a 60-minute look back at the show, the characters, how the series came about, the scoring of the music, etc.--even the odd blooper is included.  The producer, writer, and many of the actors share their thoughts.  Also included are a 6-minute skit entitled ""The Funny Side of Christmas"" (which dates between 1976-1985) and an enjoyable 30-minute ""Tribute to Dame Thora Hird"", who was unforgettable as the ""motor-vehiclely challenged"" Edie Pegden, the battle-axe wife of Wesley (who rarely appeared without his greasy overalls and could always be found tinkering in his shed with something mechanical--usually to a disastrous end!).  Sadly, Gordon Wharmby (Wesley) passed away at age 68 in 2002 from lung cancer, whilst Dame Thora died at age 91 in 2003 after suffering a stroke.

This series is a classic example of British character comedy--and what a wealth of characters there are.  Apart from the aforementioned, who can forget wily Auntie Wainwright, who sells antiques like a venus flytrap catches flies; or the hilarious antics of blind-as-a-bat Elie (sadly Danny O'Dea also died in 2003 aged 91).  From the ladies' coffee mornings, to Compo's amorous advances towards Nora Batty, to Howard's ill-fated clandestine romance with Marina, this is a series our entire family enjoys (it's my dad's favourite).  Although we enjoy the current episodes, with the loss of so many memorable characters, the 1995 Vintage hails back to a time when the series was truly at its zenith.  One can only hope the BBC will continue to bring more episodes to DVD.",1102377600,305,3851,5.1328

  What can possibly be said about the longest-running comedy in the history of the human laugh? It is more charming than it is funny, more adventurous than it is hilarious, more touching than it is humorous. People don't laugh AT Summer Wine, they laugh WITH it.

1807773,5,B00007ELCZ,"The Christmas special and 30-year review are very, very good.  It also has biographies.

The show itself is great.  There seems to be quite a bit of Howard and Maureena in the '95 shows.

If you're not familiar with Last of the Summer Wine - it's a gentle, easy-going show, primarily about 3 old retired, unattached, guys getting themselves into trouble. I'm using it to map out my own retirement plans.

It's not raucous, rowdy or bawdy, just very very funny in a sweet, homespun way.  The characters of Glenda and Barry should go down in history as two of the world's greatest lovers - these are two side characters who stick to and by each other despite being married - to each other.

It may take a show or two to get into it.  I think you have to become familiar with the characters before the humor comes out.

Glad I got it.  It's nice, after a hard day's work, to kick off your shoes, pour a drink, and kick back with Last of the Summer Wine.  It's like having a good laugh with an old friend.

I would almost take 1/2 star off for commercials that were added in front of the show menu.  You can put the dvd player on fast forward and it will automatically slow down to normal speed when the commercials are over.  Still, I think that particular production decision was wrong, and I hope whatever vile, evil, wretch dreamed it up gets the fleas of the proverbial thousand camels.",1090540800,13,1387,4.3671875

If you want to find your code, I suggest putting the model and number of your DVD player into a search on the internet. It is possible in a lot of cases to change the region code of your player...anyhow, the DVD...
The cover of the double DVD is very eye catching - and the clear picture on the front cover of the three characters is very impressive, crisp and clear and gives in instant sense of fun. The back cover is actually, even better than the front with more pictures of Compo, Clegg and Foggy, along with Nora, Edie, Glenda, Ivy and Pearl. The only dissapointment to the DVD sleeve is that it doesn't actually provide the episode titles which are on the DVD.
Now, in most cases of DVD releases of vintage BBC comedies, the special features have been very few, if not non existant, but on this DVD, they are something very, very special....
It includes the documentary Thora - A tribute to her Life and Career which is a delightful look back at the beloved actresses career in film, stage, radio and television, it includes a long since seen sketch from Compo, Clegg and Foggy called The Funny Side of Christmas, a short ten minuet section on how not to enjoy Christmas (although Compo has other ideas!). Also included are very informative biographies of the cast and crew plus, the special 2002 programme 30 Years of Last of the Summer Wine - an hour long programme starting from the very beginning in 1972 and bringing us right up to date, introducing Bill Hardcastle, Entwhistle and Alvin.

Leaving Home Forever, Or Till Teatime (3 Sep 95)
Bicycle Bonanza (10 Sep 95)
The Glamour Of The Uniform (17 Sep 95)

Beware Of The Elbow (22 Oct 95)
The Thing In Wesley's Shed (29 Oct 95)
Brushes At Dawn (5 Nov 95)
A Leg Up For Christmas (24 Dec 95)
These are all very, very funny episodes - a personal favorite, A Leg up for Christmas. The very, very good thing about this DVD, is that it is almost like a time capsual all in one box. The episodes are from 1995, and are very, very crisp and clear and the music is great - plus, this is the very first time that these episodes have been seen in widescreen. Along with the series from 1995, is the documentary, which takes us back to the start and brings us up to date, plus the short sequence The Funny Side of Christmas which is almost like a mini episode in itself, so, whatever era of the series you like best, your are sure to see part of it on this DVD.
I have no doubt in my mind at all that this will be a huge seller....and lets keep our fingers crossed for many more to come. I highly reccommend this title - it is pure gold for summer wine fans!
