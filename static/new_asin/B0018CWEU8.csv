3415068,3,B0018CWEU8,"I find Wizards deeply entertaining. The whole cast clicks very well and Selena Gomez is just awesome. However, you can get the full seasons of 1 and 2 through iTunes. You can get for $41.79 for season 1 and season 2 each. Then you can watch it on your computer, your iPod Classic, your iPod Touch, your iPhone, or connect your iPod up to your tv and watch it there. However, this product is a great alternative for those who don't have and iPod or iTunes.",1243468800,21,455,4.3023255813953485
3415069,5,B0018CWEU8,"Wizards of Waverly Place is a wonderfully entertaining show on the Disney Channel.  Selena Gomez and her brother played by David Henrie share a love/hate relationship, and they do it so well!  Selena Gomez is both a great actress and singer, who is going to go far in her acting career.  She delivers her lines with believable authority.  She is so cute!  This is something well worth purchasing, albeit it is only four episodes.

3415070,3,B0018CWEU8,I got this for my teenage sister. Wizards of Waverly Place is her favorite show and Selena Gomez is her idol. The thing I don't like is that you only get four episodes. It'd be better if Disney released full seasons of their shows rather than banking on $15 for just four episodes. They finally released Hannah Montana full seasons after releasing many 4 episode discs over the past couple years.,1228176000,42,396,4.591549295774648
3415071,4,B0018CWEU8,"This is Harry Potter meets That's So Raven! Only there's not a lot of Harry Potter mystery going on. It's more of a comedy with a light-hearted look at what it would be like to be a wizard with real magical powers living in our non-magical world. The middle child, Alex, is always looking for ways to use her magic to speed things up or take the easy way out, but just like Raven--who tried to make her visions come true instead of just letting them play out, she finds herself in a heap of trouble that needs straightening out. And just like Raven, it's her brother coming to the rescue. Well, most of the time.",1217203200,7,612,4.2844827586206895

3415125,5,B0018CWEU8,"I happened to be flipping through the channels late one night and came across Wizards of Waverly Place. I new the show existed, but I never tried watching because I don't care today's kids series. After watching a few minutes I was hooked.

The episodes on the DVD are:

Wizard School Part 1

Wizard School Part 2

Curb Your Dragon

Disenchanted Evening

The problem I have with Disney releasing the series to DVD is that they never release full seasons. Typically, they release four to five episodes on DVD at a low price, which can make a great birthday or Christmas gift.

Is it just me, or does the wizard school's outfits look a lot like the ones worn in Harry Potter?",1345766400,4,673,4.467213114754099
3415126,4,B0018CWEU8,"Obviously, this movie builds upon the TV show. It's sure to please fans of the show. It's cute, well done, and has some funny moments. However, on its own it's not the most exciting movie. The movie doesn't introduce or develop the characters because it relies on the TV show, so if you've never watched it you might find it hard to get into the movie. Selena Gomez as the witch just comes off as annoying - imagine a teenager empowered with magic - and her acting isn't particularly good. Still the supporting characters are fun, especially Max's wisecracks. Cute movie, if you're not expecting much.",1344643200,,601,4.679245283018868
