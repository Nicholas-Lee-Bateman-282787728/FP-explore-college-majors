8402486,5,B003QQ6TR8,"Body Switch has Boris as a scientist who can switch brain patterns between 2 individuals. He first does this with 2 monkeys,1 wild 1 tame. After strapping them to his machine and attaching the spcial electric helmets and turning on the machine, the wild monkey becomes tame and vice versa, thus proving success. Imagine the benefits of such a device,an old man can switch bodies with a young man and can have eternal life by changing bodies from time to time. Sadly, Boris genius is not appreciated by the medical community which does not believe him. When his funds are cut off, Boris snaps, and, well, maybe I said too much already. Anyway this is one of Boris' better movies.
Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome is good fun too. Boris is the title criminal who steals a chemical gas that frezzes people in there tracks. Ralph Byrd, who played Dick Tracy on the TV series, must bring this gruesome Gruesome to justice. It ads up to a fun horror crime movie.",1276128000,4,949,4.588235294117647
