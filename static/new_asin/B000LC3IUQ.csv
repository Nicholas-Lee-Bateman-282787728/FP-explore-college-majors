8161140,1,B000LC3IUQ,"This looked sort of interesting, so I bought it.  Once I got it, the description on the DVD case made it even more intriguing.  Unfortunately, the plot (?) was bad, and the acting worse.  I can stomach a lot, and am a fan of a lot of grade B Sci-Fi movies, but this is one of the worst movies I've seen.  I kept waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen.  Nothing did.  This was obviously an amateur production on no budget, but it was a waste of film/tape.

Don't waste your money.",1206489600,,482,4.230769230769231
8161141,2,B000LC3IUQ,"Please think twice before buying this DVD. It's comparisons to the Mad Max trilogy and any Sergio Leone western are near blasphemy and if you believe that's what you're about to watch, you'll be very dissapointed. The GGI special effects they used for most of the scenery and backdrops is horrible...horrible. The acting is awful and the costumes/ wardrobe are pathetic. Believe me when I say I'm a huge fan of B and low budget movies but Planetfall is nowhere near B or cult movie status or even cheap entertainment. I know this movie had a super low budget but part of the charm of a low budget film is that it makes up for it with good acting and characters and a cool story. The 2 women cast in the lead roles couldn't act their way out of a paper bag and their lame characters are hardly strong enough to carry this film. Don't waste your money.",1180137600,12,850,4.386075949367089

Starring: Ted V. Mikels,John Levene and Chaz Truog.

Although the leads remind you of Nicole Kidman and Carrie Fischer,This is NOT their movie.
The  computer graphics in PF are fantastic,Really top notch look. I feel talking about the budget HAS nothing to do with the actual film you will see. This is a epic Sci-Fi/Western themed adventure. PF has a rich background story of race struggle and the united search for a most powerful object. The music is really great,Perfect for each scene. At  times PF comes off like one of those BBC Sci-Fi efforts,That PBS loves to show when they want us starving US pledgers to call-in donations. Seriously I tried to find something to pick on,If you knew me better,You say sounds too professional for your tastes. If this hadn't taken for so long to film(Gleaned from huge extras included) ,I'd say look for sequels---Too Bad A+ effort.",1176249600,8,923,5.019607843137255
8161143,5,B000LC3IUQ,"Usually when someone describes something as ""different"" it's usually a nice way of saying it's bad. Not here...""Planetfall"" is different in a good way.

Most modern Sci-Fi films you see today are devoid of vision. What Hollywood has been turning out lately have been nothing but action films with a sci-fi bend. Here is a film that takes the time to go the extra mile. It's like a Sci-Fi version of an old spaghetti western. Think ""The Good, The Bad, The Ugly"" in outer space. Very ingenious.

Yeah, the film has an awfully low budget but I didn't feel distracted by it and I think that fact doesn't take away from the creativeness, humor and great acting this film has.

It was just a lot of fun to watch.",1174435200,12,706,4.457364341085271
8161144,4,B000LC3IUQ,"If the extra materials on the disc are to be believed, and the movie was actually made for next to nothing, I think this is showing the kind of technical quality that indie filmmakers need to try for.

Sure, the movie has all the earmarks of low budget... cheesy props, stilted dialogue, bad acting (and good acting too), and some hairpin turns that leave you scratching your head, but overall the film looks like it was made by people who cared about what they were doing

and were having some fun while they did it. Trying ot compare this movie with, say, Serenity (a similarly themed sci-fi sort of thing) would be impossible considering the huge budget gap you'd have to allow for.  And frankly, Serenity didn't do this well with the millions they had!

And peaking of extras, I don't think I've ever seen an indie DVD with this much extra stuff on it.  Its like they spent more time on the extras than on the actual film!  So if extras are a selling point for you, you won't be disappointed.",1173830400,3,996,4.445054945054945
