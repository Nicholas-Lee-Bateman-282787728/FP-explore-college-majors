I just wish that this was available on DVD. I already have 3 copies of the VHS due to being damaged by the VHS player and being dropped as well and for it being played most of the time. Is there a DVD version of it anywhere?",1447459200,,394,3.817073170731707
8672738,5,B00001ZWBN,"I purchased this video as a Christmas present for my new grandson who was only 2 months old at Christmas. My daughter played the video for my grandson during those early months. She told me that he loved it. I didn't really believe that such a young child could enjoy anything as much as she said. Last week we had the opportunity to spend a week's vacation with them. EVERY time that they put this video on, he started kicking his feet, twisting in our arms, straining to turn his head if he was facing the other direction, etc. He is now 7 months old and seems to love the video even more. I don't know why he likes it so much. It may be because the music is upbeat and the objects are large and colorful. Whatever the reason, he loves this video! We felt a little foolish playing Christmas songs in May but it was worth seeing his excited gestures, the sparkle in his eyes, etc.  I recommend this video to anyone who has young children and who likes Christmas music all year long!",1022716800,,983,4.28494623655914
