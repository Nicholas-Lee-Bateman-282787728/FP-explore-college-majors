The presenter in this video takes you to a few of the reconstructed structures of the West Stow archeological site in Great Britain where Anglo-Saxons lived for centuries. The structures are empty, there are no re-enactors, and the presenter tells us time and time again that they really don't know if the Anglo-Saxons really built structures like them. It was like a bad lecture by the worst college professor you ever had nightmares about. There was absolutely nothing about Beowulf in this video. As a matter of fact, there absolutely nothing about *anything* in this video!

The most annoying thing about the video was that, at the end, he states cheerfully that there's a wonderful museum right over there with thousands of artifacts (weapons, armor, tools, jewelry, and other priceless things that tell us so much about who these people were and how they lived) in it that he's *not* going to show us. Gee, thanks. Grrrr!

It was bad. It was very bad. I wish there were lots of good videos on the peoples of temperate europe during this time period. There just aren't so I can't suggest something else. Just don't buy this one.

Edit May 13, 2017: I've found a better DVD! Check this one out. It's much, much better!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beowulf-The-Anglo-saxons/dp/B000LC3IWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beowulf & The Anglo-saxons</a>",1253318400,14,1551,5.2926829268292686
