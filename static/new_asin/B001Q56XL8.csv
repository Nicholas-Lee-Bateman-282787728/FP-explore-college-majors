8335016,1,B001Q56XL8,"Neale in the interview says when this voice of ""God"" went on to say the 10 commandments were not from God he (Neale) said he was shocked and news to him as he had believed them to be true, Yet, in ""Friendship with God"", Neale says he grew tired of the Bible and it's hard truths while he was reading and teaching it in sunday school and so, he began seeking for truth, began reading the Koran and many other spiritual texts, then years later he started to chat with God. There is NO WAY he believed in the 10 Commandments, especially the 1st one....ye will have no other god before me as I am a jealous God"". In this interview, Neale shows how intelligent he is, he is a VERY wise man, yet in CWG and the ""New Revelations"" he seems to have the intelligence level of a moron. You decide for yourself, this was MY review.",1273104000,,819,4.189873417721519
8335017,5,B001Q56XL8,"I've read the first CWG and I am getting ready to start the second book and I am having my eyes opened quite wide.  After watching this video I can say that I am even more motivated to get into the second book and then the third.  I have always felt that it was completely ludicrous to think that God would talk to people 2000 years ago and then just shut up for the rest of time.  What kind of God what do something like that?  Are we not just as important to God as the people of biblical times?  And I am left with the unmistakable conclusion that God has not stopped talking to us.  We have only stopped listening.

I did like one question and answer that I saw in this video where Neale asks, ""Why don't You fix the world?""  I halfway expected God to answer, ""because I didn't break it.""  His answer of, ""Why don't you?"" wasn't too far off.  It is time, as Neale puts it in the video, for us, as a human race, to regain our spirituality and stop trying to solve the worlds' problems economically, militaristically or politically.

This is an excellent video to get to know Neale a little better and to think of things in a different way.  I was a little surprised by the inclusion of meditation video for the last 20-30 minutes of the video, but that's okay, as I am working on my meditations and this is another nice video to help with that.

Get the video.  You won't be disappointed.",1272844800,,1391,4.21969696969697
8335018,4,B001Q56XL8,"Only 44 minutes of this 104-minute dvd contains an interview with Neale David Walsch. The remaining 60 minutes is comprised of meditation tracks, which appear to have been tacked on as an afterthought (perhaps to justify the charge?). There are much better meditation dvds out there. If you like Walsch, you'll like the interview; just don't expect 104 minutes of the author. IMHO, you can get more bang for the buck elsewhere.",1248048000,10,427,4.944444444444445
8335019,1,B001Q56XL8,"The Bible gives some tests for prophets/scribes in Deuteronomy 18:21-22 and Matthew 7:22-23.

It also states that vision and prophecy were ""sealed up"" after the Book of Revelation almost 2000 years ago.  So, either the Bible speaks the truth or Neale does...which is it?

What fool would believe that this is God's latest scribe?  Neale is talking to himself.  If God talked to everyone, there wouldn't be so many contradictions and subsets of religions, and there would be no need for prophets and scribes!!  You could just get the answer directly.  Why would you go through someone else?

When God spoke to people in the Bible, he gave those around them SIGNS and PROOF to let people know that they were from God.  There were set requirements laid down that people had to prove that God spoke to them.

In 50 years, no one will remember this book, but, consider this:

""Jesus was born in an obscure village, the child of a peasant woman.  He grew up in another village, where He worked in a carpenter shop until He was thirty.  Then for three years He was an itinerant preacher.  He never wrote a book.  He never held an office.  He never had a family or owned a home.  He didn't go to college.  He never visited a big city.  He never traveled two hundred miles from the place where He was born.  He did none of the things that usually accompany greatness.  He had no credentials but Himself.
  He was only thirty-three when the tide of public opinion turned against Him.  His friends ran away.  One of them denied Him.  He was turned over to His enemies and went through the mockery of a trial. He was nailed to a cross between two thieves.
  While He was dying, His executioners gambled for His garments, the only property He had on earth.  When He was dead, He was laid in a borrowed grave through the pity of a friend.  Twenty centuries have come and gone, and today He is the central figure of the human race.
  All the armies that ever marched, all the navies that ever sailed, all the parliaments that ever sat, all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man on this earth as much as that one solitary life.""",1245196800,7,2151,4.4498714652956295
8335020,5,B001Q56XL8,"I would enthusiastically recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in Neale Donald Walsch, whether you are a long-time fan and have read all his books like me, or if you are just starting out and want to get to know the author better. Peter Beamish does an amazing job interviewing Neale, asking poignant, meaningful questions and then being patient enough to let Neale respond with as full and complete an answer as possible. I was inspired by watching this film, I hope you are, too!",1244505600,10,489,4.632183908045977
