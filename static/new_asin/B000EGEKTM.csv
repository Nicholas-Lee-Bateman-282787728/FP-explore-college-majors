8109540,1,B000EGEKTM,"I feel very disappointed and upset to spend more than thirty dollars on purchasing this one hour DVD cuz it's not the Street Jazz style at all. The dance style showed in the DVE is very old fashion and without any sexy element. Street Jazz, also called sexy Jazz or Power Jazz, is especially for girls to dance in night club or some vibrant stages to show charm and activate the dance atmosphere. Street Jazz should involve body wave and hip roll and other actions which require highly body flexibility. However, in this DVD, the dance is not in the category of Stree Jazz though it is kind of Street Dance. Now I am gonna sell it out as it can't be returned...",1302912000,,661,4.382113821138211
8109541,5,B000EGEKTM,"This is a great DVD. I found it easy to watch and easy to follow. Im a beginner jazz dancer and loved the beginner / intermediate routine. Rhapsody was easy going, her style of teaching is easy to follow. I like the breakdown section where she demonstrates each step.
I also like her constant references to musicality - this is something im not so good at - but the way she teaches makes it stick in my head better. I was unable to do the advanced routine, but thats not unexpected for a beginner. Just like in a real class - It will take a beginner a couple of weeks of practice to get the intermediate and advanced routines correct.
Watching the DVD also made me aware of choreography - steps that show happiness, love and sadness. Pretty cool. This is a dance style that anyone young or old can try. A++++",1208908800,5,808,4.322368421052632

8109543,1,B000EGEKTM,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The moves are boring and corny, and the instructor did not really inspire me at all. Also the music was horrible. I don't like to say negative things about other's creative works, but this is not worth the money.",1167782400,3,251,4.478260869565218
