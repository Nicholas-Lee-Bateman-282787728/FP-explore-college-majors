8680886,4,B00NX17P7O,"A short film by actor, director Elliott Mason. This short film was released in 2014 but was actually filmed before dslr's came about, so it was mostly done on video.  The purpose of the short was intended for financing a feature film. For a low to no budget 43 min short about time travel with mention of John Titor, it was interesting, funny and campy.  Recommended for filmmakers and those who are just starting out.",1516838400,,418,4.56
8680887,1,B00NX17P7O,"An almost interesting take on time travel, however the lack of budget clearly limited this films potential. Additionally, the strong political undertones crossed with the excessive nature shots place this movie somewhere in between Birdemic and Buffalo Rider on the B-movie scale. If Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still around I'm sure this film would be featured on it. Honestly though, unless you're a B-movie collector I would have a difficult time recommending this film.
To the film makers: I respect the effort, we all started from somewhere and I hope your next production exceeds this one.",1462752000,,600,5.195876288659794
