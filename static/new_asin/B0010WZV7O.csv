8238951,1,B0010WZV7O,"I just bought this at Best Buy where it's exclusively sold. I was expecting ""Live Performances"" as the cover art states. EH! WRONG! This DVD was so bad. At first, I thought this was when they first recorded the songs for the album. But the extra rap verse from Sebastian on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Way-I-Are/dp/B000SBUC4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Way I Are</a>"" wasn't in the recording that made it on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timbaland-Presents-Shock-Value/dp/B000NA26ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timbaland Presents Shock Value</a>"". Also, their lip movements didn't always match their vocals and in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Way-I-Are/dp/B000SBUC4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Way I Are</a>"" performance, D.O.E. Is scratching a vinyl record and there is no scratching sounds. This tells me Timbaland and others faked the performances. I rightfully deserve my $4.99 Plus Tax back for this Wrongfully advertised DVD. If you are ever at Best Buy, avoid this at all costs. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go whine like a baby to Best Buy. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1197763200,4,1203,6.6687898089171975
