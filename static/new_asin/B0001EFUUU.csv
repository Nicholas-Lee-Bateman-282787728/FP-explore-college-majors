8011335,1,B0001EFUUU,I expected more scenes from the movies these ladies starred in.  Not!  It was 90% talkies...no action whatsoever.  It should have been a radio commentary on a CD.  Save your money.  You'll definitely scream about this one.  You'll scream because you paid for it.,1395619200,3,262,4.840909090909091
8011336,5,B0001EFUUU,"Director Jason Paul Collum certainly knows his horror films, and it shows. Collum has come a long way since discovering his love for horror films in the seventh grade, directing the cult 5 DARK SOULS trilogy, and MARK OF THE DEVIL 666. He made a splash with the short film JULIA WEPT, starring Brinke Stevens, and has a long history writing articles and conducting interviews for FEMME FATALES and CINEMAFANTASTIQUE magazines, even serving as editor-in-chief for a brief period in the magazines' history. Now, he brings his love and knowledge of horror films to this tidy little documentary, chronicling the experiences of several B-film actresses.
The lovely Brinke Stevens is our host for this frank, honest, and fascinating look at the trials, tribulations, and hardships these ladies had to go through to make it, only to suffer the concequences of low pay and lack of respect for what they do. Collum lets the actresses speak candidly about a variety of subjects, pouring out their hearts and souls for the camera. It is an intense and emotion filled 65 minutes which will undoubtedly give anyone a new-found respect for the B film industry and the actresses who sacrifice fame to do what they love.
Among the actresses interviewed are:
  - Judith O'Dea - ""Night of the Living Dead""
  - Brandi Burkett - ""Slumber Party Massacre 3""
  - Felissa Rose - ""Sleepaway Camp""
  - Debre DeLiso - ""Slumber Party Massacre""
  - Denice Duff - ""Vampire Resurrection""
  - Lilith Stabs - ""Deadly Stingers""
  - Debbie Rochon - ""American Nightmare""
  - Arianna Albright - ""Witchhouse""
  - Julie Strain - ""Heavy Metal 2000""

The documentary is an engaging, insightful and thoroughly entertaining look at these wonderful ladies, and definitely makes one appreciate all the times they have shared their lung power for the world to hear. Lots of added bonuses also make this disc worthwhile, including Collum's JULIA WEPT short (a must for any Brinke Stevens fan), an interview with Brinke Stevens and Jason Sechrest about the film, the JULIA WEPT TRAILER, and two Debbie Rochon student films. There is also a fun short about Lizzie Strain, Julia's younger sister.
You don't have to be a horror film buff to enjoy this. Collum has done a terrific job to make this one documentary anyone can enjoy.
  JULIA WEPT REVIEW
One of the eleven films made in 2000 starring Brinke Stevens, JULIA WEPT is a half hour psychological horror short written and directed by Jason Paul Collum, whose other film credits include the 5 Dark Souls trilogy, and Mark of the Devil 666.
Julia is plagued by nightmares of a terrifying car accident. When she finally wakes up, nothing in this world is the same. Her husband has disappeared, she can hear voices call to her from behind the walls, and inanimate objects terrifyingly come to life. To make matters worse, Julia is haunted by visions of the dead, including those of her sister, who died seven months before, and the mother and son victims of the accident from her dream. Alone and scared, Julia must fight for her life in the nightmarish hell this world has become for her.
Shot on a budget of only 100 dollars, this the film that deservedly gave director Jason Paul Collum the credit he deserves. The plot is great, and the film itself is very eerie, wonderfully shot by Collum on home video, which gives it a grainy look that adds to the tension.",1088985600,3,3365,4.817391304347826
8011337,4,B0001EFUUU,"I saw a screening of this film at a local university a few months ago and it was well worth it.  Horror films are not my fort, but this piece gave me a newfound respect and admiration for those involved, especially the women.  It was really very interesting to hear what they had to go through, from THEIR perspective as opposed to a more casual observer.  I would highly recommend this documentary for anyone interested in horror films, scream queens, the film industry, and women in cinema.  Also, the writer/director/producer, Jason Paul Collum, has several of his own films out.  I've seen Julia Wept a few times and there is one scene that never fails to give me the shivers.",1078704000,3,680,4.633333333333334
