7935841,5,B00005AUEC,"""American Fighter Pilot"" OR Ultimate Dogfighting""..its a no brainer! Ultimate Dodfighting all the way!  From World War I to the future this DVD puts you in the cockpit for the ultimate in dogfighting action. Any mistake could result in defeat and probable death.  Learn what it takes to be a fighter pilot, including the essential dogfighting maneuvers.  One drawback of DVD is that you cannot rewind to watch over again.  Loved it though :)",1133740800,,441,4.918918918918919
7935842,5,B00005AUEC,"The above review by Robert J McNamara sums these programs up well. Other interesting points include: Interviews with Aces like Robin Olds. Air combat footage of W.W.I, Korea and Vietnam in the ULTIMATE DOGFIGHTING DVD that is narrated by Peter Thomas.

Run time is 2 1/2 hrs.

The SUPERIOR AIRPOWER DVD deals with the operations aboard

an aircraft carrier, the development and use of stealth

technology in todays F-117 fighter and B-2 bomber, and the

tactics, aircraft, and weapons used to win the Gulf War.

Many types of aircraft are looked at in these programs.

Run time is 3 hrs.

These programs are well put together and very informative

especially if you want to learn about or have an interest in aviation.

I highly recommend this 2 disc set it is well worth the price!",1123891200,2,782,4.725925925925926
7935843,5,B00005AUEC,"I was very pleased with these two DVDs. Ultimate Dogfighting is in two parts and covers dogfighting from WW1 to the present day. Interesting interviews with the aces like Robin Olds (WW2 and Vietnam) and Ray Brookes (WW1). Second Part covers the training and has excellent in cockpit video during DACM sorties. The bonus tracks are neat too. Loved the computer animated sections that illustrated two aces talking you through their moves as they successfully downed their enemy. First guy was WW2 in the Pacific and the second an F86 pilot vs MiG-15s in Korea.
The Second DVD is Navy oriented and is just as much fun as the second. I would not hestitate to recommend.",1029283200,9,666,4.75
