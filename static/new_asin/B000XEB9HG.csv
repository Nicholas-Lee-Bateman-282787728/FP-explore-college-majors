8228082,5,B000XEB9HG,"When friends ask me what this film is about, I have a hard time. I just say: ""It is about conscience""
(in Russian: ""o sovesti""). Twelve men are defining the fate of a defendant, each of them through the lenses
of their own conscience. Each of them tells his own life story. All of those are delivered through strong, convincing, first class acting. Sergej Garmash's performance deserves an  Oscar by itself.  Every time I watch it,  I think about how far this is from Hollywood, how incomparable, how much substance it has. It get straight to your heart. And the heart bleeds.
I wish the director Michalkov chose not to appear in the film himself.  Michalkov has a very strong, powerful personality, reinforced by his top status in the society. In this film though, it makes his character of a war veteran less believable.  It plainly detracts attention from the character. However, those are just details.
The movie is like a series of snapshots of Russian life. At the same time it is a deep look at humanity.  I am not sure how a foreigner could absorb so much Russian context.  However, I am sure those who want will succeed.  I highly esteem Nikita Michalkov as a director. None of his films, though, was on my personal list, unlike those of Milosh Forman.  ""12"" won my heart and became my favorite film of 2007 (  ""The Island"" by Pavel Lungin was my favorite in 2006.)",1208822400,3,1374,4.571428571428571
8228083,5,B000XEB9HG,"I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend everyone to see it.  It's too bad that this movie did not win the Oscar for the foreign movie.  I think most American viewers will not understand it because this film is very Russian.  It left me thinking about our legal system here and how one person can decide what happens to you in court. Here in US or there in Russia.  The actors were absolutely great. Everyone's acting was excellent, simply flawlessly.  Just pure enjoyment. I had a great time watching it, watch it and enjoy.",1206835200,7,529,4.526315789473684
8228084,2,B000XEB9HG,"""12"" (2207) is a bad movie, with the huge holes in the plot, with the characters that are more of caricatures and clichs than the real 12 angry men representing the different layers of the modern Russian society , and with the good actors giving overheated non-convincing performances, that often sounded false and made me cringe. To top it all, Mikhalkov took it upon himself a role of God-like figure who is above the laws and who knows better than anyone else what is good for the particular case, for the law, and for the whole country. I am a big fan of earlier Mikhalkov's films. He is a talented filmmaker. He's made more than few films he could be justly proud of. Among them ""Svoy sredi chuzhikh, chuzhoy sredi svoikh"" (Friend Among Strangers, Stranger Among Friends, 1974) - simply great, it was first film Nikita directed and starred and it was first Russian Art-action movie that takes place during the Civil War of the 1918-1921. It is fun - clever, nicely shot, and wonderfully acted by the best actors of the time. Is regarded as one of the best ""Easterns"", the western: Russian style and is almost as popular and beloved as the masterpiece of the genre, ""Beloye Solntse Pustyni"" aka ""White Sun of Desert"". There is also Raba lyubvi (Slave of Love, 1976) with the incredible performance by the Muse of his earlier films, Yelena Solovey as a doomed silent screen star in the shattering world of the Russian Revolution of the 1917 and the following Civil War of 1918-1921. The final scene of the movie - Olga Voznesenskaya (Solovey) in the runaway tram is heart-breaking and tragically beautiful. Mikhalkov's adaptations of the Goncharov's ""Oblomov"" and Chekhov's ""Platonov"" are first rate and proved his taste, talent, cinematic vision, and ability to get the fine performances from all his actors. He was successful in creating , smaller, chamber compelling pieces with only few main characters, like Pyat vecherov (Five Evenings,) 1979 and Bez svideteley (Without Witness) 1983. He deservingly won the Oscar for Utomlyonnye solntsem (Burnt by the Sun, 1994) which I see as the tragic sequel to his earlier masterpiece, ""Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano"". It went down the hill after his Oscar victory. Sibirskiy tsiryulnik (The Barber of Siberia, 1998) was nothing more than a glossy post card, ""From Russia with Love"". I think he only made it to be able to play the Emperor, Alexander III. And now - ""12"", 12 jurors or 11 apostles following who? ""V belom venchike iz roz vperedi Isus Christos"" (""In a white roses nimbus on his head, Jesus Christ is walking ahead"")? Is that the role Nikita Mikhalkov thinks he is fit to play in the movie and in the reality?",1201305600,10,2679,4.813449023861171

 That's pretty much the idea. Really good movie. Brings up lots of issues, and not only those that are related to soviet life style. There are some dramatization in the environment, so for those who are not familiar with ex-ussr life it may seem little too much, kinda like ""There are bears on street of Moscow"" I just ignored that.
 Other than that - really really really good acting, real simple set and decorations, filmed in the way that shows only ""natural lighting"" and it sure adds more drama. Dialogs are ""to listen to"" - really easy to miss the line.
 After about half an hour, the idea of the plot becomes obvious and then viewer just waits for an ending. Actors did a great job keeping viewer busy : it is not special effects, chase, slang, decoration blowing up movie. Similar to a court drama, well it is, but really not the kind you get from Hollywood.

 Totally recommend.",1196035200,4,929,4.5
