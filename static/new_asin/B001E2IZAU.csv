This video cannot provide enough information to start practicing outcome-driven innovation, but it is an excellent introduction to the key concepts! This was very useful at our company, where there was no way to persuade the entire management team to read a several hundred page book, but we could all watch the video and then make a group decision to learn more about outcome-driven innovation.

As for outcome-driven innovation itself, the ideas are very appealing. I cannot say that we have yet put them into practice and seen results, but we are optimistic that Ulwick's concepts will be useful.",1329177600,,661,5.064220183486238
8326377,1,B001E2IZAU,"As much as I appreciate the Outcome Driven Innovation framework and approach, this DVD is a disappointing addition to all the material freely available on youtube - of similar ilk, or Mr Ulwick's book. Buy the book, or the HBR/MIT articles. Invest in other ways the 20 dollars and 50 minutes required by this DVD.",1243296000,,313,4.709090909090909
