875799,5,6304414153,"Rather than Depardieu's role being underwritten, it was just right within the rich tableau of the entire movie. His was supposed to be a small role, and just because Depardieu played it doesn't mean it  was 'underwritten'.  It fit.
Rowlands acted superbly -  most reviewers I've seen mention  this, justifiably. Yet of the major reviewers only Hebert mentioned Marisa  Tomei's equally superb performance. Not the same movie without her. She  added the necessary spiced vinegar and humor, providing contrast - a  sharper edge to what might otherwise have seemed a touch on the sweet  side.
I'd love to see more movies like this -  without great implaccable  denouements ending with bombs bursting in air. No, this is a heartfelt,  charming movie that entertains throughout without resorting to the cheaper  methods of garnering our attention. Yet the pace was there, pulling us  along easily.
Great acting, unpretentious writing, a lifelike plot - all  these elements combine to make Unhook the Stars a thoroughly pleasant  watch. Nex",932428800,17,1033,5.175757575757576

875875,3,6304414153,"Very interesting interplay. . .

Some good acting (Tomei is EXTREMELY good), and a touching relationship between the middle-aged woman and her neighbor's boy.

The central character provides love and support freely and generously to those around her but then, apparently to prevent people from becoming too dependent on her and thus emotionally stunted, she takes the initiative in ending the relationships and resolutely moving on.

What turns me very much off is the fact that it seems that everyone is constantly smoking and drinking, even in the presence of a child. Is this product placement?

Because of the cigarettes and alcohol, i reducing the score by one star.",1409616000,,671,5.128440366972477
875876,5,6304414153,a cute heart warming story.  gena is a fave of mine and I collecting her movies.  I have seen this on tv and had to get it in DVd form for my collection.  she is a wonderful actress.,1396569600,,182,3.736842105263158
875877,5,6304414153,"I love this movie , as a woman, because it shows the complicated relationships of being a mother and nurturer to all and how much energy it requires and ultimately a feeling of losing oneself. I love her decision at the end to forgoe anymore relationships of caring for others and seeking a new life for herself of uncertainty and exploration into a life she never planned for or expected , but has the courage to seek It out. Bravo ! I love Gena Rowlands anyways, she always seems to play strong female roles .",1394064000,,511,4.389473684210526

876021,5,6304414153,"this movie is fictional but i learned something very important from it.  it is about relationships and even though two people can be completely different, they can still need each other.  i hope you watch it and can learn what i did.  i will always remember Gena Rowland's character advice to Marisa Tomei (sp?)",1331596800,,311,4.722222222222222
876022,4,6304414153,I got hooked from the beginning. The relationship with the little boy warmed my heart. Everyone should grow up with such a great influence in their lives. The emotional torment was a bit to handle with Mother and daughter. Had me crying for acceptance. I think the Mother did in her own way.  What choices to make? I think it leaves you to think what your own choices would be. Great movie.,1303689600,,390,4.416666666666667
876023,4,6304414153,"Gena Rowlands' son Nick Cassavetes made his directorial debut with this sympathetic look at a kind hearted mother finally taking the time to find herself.  The film is nothing extraordinary, but the stellar performances by the cast, especially Mrs. Rowlands herself, elevate this tale to something truly memorable.

Mildred Hawks is a devoted mother who finds herself being used by her daughter Annie, who refuses to take responsibility for herself.  In the wake of her husband's death her family is torn and she finds herself lonely and searching for something, anything, to fill the emptiness.  When she meets Monica Warren, her abused next-door-neighbor, her emptiness starts to fade.  Monica, having recently split from her husband, needs someone to watch her young son J.J. and Mildred is more than willing.  The two form a very close bond, and her relationship with the pair finally helps her to see that a life of serving others is only truly rewarding when you find time to serve yourself.

The story is a simple one, and it has a very unpredictable ending which I truly enjoyed, but it lives and dies with the beautiful performances that dwell within its running time.

Gena Rowlands is a great veteran actress who knows how to develop a natural performance out of any character.  Mildred is your average grandmotherly woman who has spent her entire life serving others and it is finally taking its toll.  Her daughter is ungrateful, her son is demanding and spoiled and her home is empty.  Rowlands allows these circumstances to read all over her face.  Her interactions with young Jake Lloyd are also a highlight for she is able to act like your typical grandmother, without all the Hollywood stereotypes.  You feel like you know her.  Marisa Tomei (one of my favorite actresses) is phenomenal here, even if at first it doesn't seem like it.  She seems a little all over the place in the beginning, but as the film progresses and her character develops you can see that she has become a product of her upbringing and her unstable environment and she portrays that perfectly.

`Unhook the Stars' is not a perfect film, but it is a very good one that will definitely leave you entertained and rather enlightened.  Rowlands and Tomei are a beautiful duo of performers who understand just what is needed to deliver a thoughtful message, and young Jake Lloyd is not only cute as a button but very effective in his role as the little boy who brings these two women together.",1230595200,,2479,4.822695035460993
876024,3,6304414153,"The emotional manipulations are a bit much here. The cute kid. The estranged daughter. The next door party girl mom. Gena Rowlands plays a middle aged mom with no one to care for until she 'adopts' the mixed up mess next door. It's a bit improbable because the LA neighborhood looks pretty upscale and way too expensive for the Marisa Tomei loser and her even worse hubby. Still, I'd rather watch this than a shoot em up with no redeeming social value. It's a decent drama. Just not particularly special.",1221004800,3,504,4.611111111111111
876025,5,6304414153,I absolutely love this movie.  Gena Rowlands really is at her BEST in this one.  I just could not understand how they classified it as a comedy.  I viewed it with a serious point of view.,1081468800,5,187,4.138888888888889
876026,5,6304414153,"The ""mature"" years are so often neglected in film, unless it's as the butt of a joke.  Not here, however.  The incomporable Gena Rowlands plays a character whose intelligence and self-possession seem an extension of Rowlands herself, making it a very good fit.  Seeing a woman who has raised her children and is now searching for what to become is a refreshing storyline.  Tomei adds marvelous support as the ""white trash"" neighbor, and I really appreciated how the director never gave us easy answers for these characters.  Tomei never turns into a lady, and Rowlands never quite figures out where she is going:  she merely decides to take the journey.  The character of Tomei's son adds a touching poignancy to the story, highlighting Rowland's search for identity at this late stage in her life.  This film doesn't jump up and tell you what it's about; it quietly presents Rowland's life and lets you figure it out--perhaps this requires a little more thinking than some viewers would like.  Unlike other films that on first viewing seem obtuse, all the answers are there in ""Unhook the Stars"" if the viewer takes time to look for them.  Every performance is subtly nuanced and adds to the theme (a good example is the luncheon scene with the adult son and his wife.  Watch the subtle interplay between those two and you will know all you need to know abou their relationship-and why Rowlands chooses not to live with them.)  This is a terrific film that can be enjoyed by thinking adults, and might particularly speak to men or women who have reached retirement age and are beginning to reevaluate their identity.",1064275200,23,1617,4.79783393501805
876027,4,6304414153,"Gena Rowlands and Marisa Tomei star in this wonderful movie about two generation helping each other out through life lessons and love.  Rowlands is a lonely lady who helps Tomei watch her little boy, and with that Rowlands comes alive again and the boy brings new meaning to her life.  Jake Lloyd plays the little boy and he will tug at your heart strings so perfectly.  Superbly acted by these fine Oscar winning ladies, this little-known movie is worth it.  Sometimes funny, sad, touching, and honest, it tells the truth about what people can do for one another if we are not afraid to give it a try and look beyond ourselves.  Unhook the Stars, be real to yourself and those around you, and don't be afraid to give it a chance.",1030579200,5,730,4.5
