7739061,4,B01ENSOKJQ,"Line of Duty is a BBC police procedural that is quite well received in the UK and the US. I had seen series one several years ago, and have since seen series three. This was an excellent series for the most part, the final episode had some very unrealistic scenes that gave me a laugh.

AC12, is a police anti-corruption unit, that is focused on investigating a situation or a certain person in the police force. These people are investigating their own, and that is a difficult situation in itself. In this series three, relationships are established and revealed. There is violence, and what you think you know may be turned upside down.

The Cast  is superb, and if you follow UK actors you may recognize several. The initial investigative piece concentrates on an investigation into an elite firearms unit. What is noticeable here is that the UK keeps all guns and bullets under lock and key and has a highly involved procedure for the release and recovery of each.  This investigation became more complex as more crimes were perpetrated. The unit became suspicious of each other, no one seemed safe, and I was confused at times who really was the good guy.
The step by step procedures of presenting information and clues and the superb investigative work held my attention.

This is not your usual police procedural, excellent scripts and acting, and I am enthused to move onto series 4.

7739078,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"One of the best shows in years.  BBC killed it. Phenomenal writing, acting, and filmmaking.  Complex characters who are well developed and unexpected, but really absorbing plot twists. I binge watched each series and watched again with my husband.  My brother is a successful Hollywood film editor and he thanked me for recommending this.  I watched the first four series on Hulu Plus and then bought the first three series and will buy the fourth on Amazon to have permanently.  Definitely start with series 1.  It takes a few episodes to get into and can be a little confusing, but once the show hits its stride in the middle of the first series, it's fantastic.  Hard to find a show that's totally different from anything else I've seen and unbelievable that the long interview sequences are absolutely absorbing.

7739137,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"This series is excellent.  I cannot get enough of it!  There is a constant interplay of strengthening and eroding trust.  Viewers can never be certain themselves whom to trust as the events unfold, and the flow in information trickles from one character to the next, each with conflicting motives. The characters are complex and well-developed, and the array of personalities adds greatly to the drama.  Throughout the series, I find myself ""pulling for them"" through their weak moments and their triumphs.  It is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.  I find that I watch each series twice, mostly because I don't have CC, and the plot moves at a brisk pace, so I miss significant segments of dialogue (largely because I'm American).  Even if I didn't miss any dialogue, I might watch each series twice.",1477094400,3,811,5.052631578947368

I called this to Amazon's attention, but no action was taken.  Shame on Acorn for including this in their production description.

I was able to watch this series as it aired, and, in this era of constant spoilers, the major twist was completely unexpected, largely thanks to the welcome deceptions played by the cast and creators.  It being a complete surprise added greatly to the enjoyment of the series, and I'm sorry that anyone who reads the description or the very spoiler-heavy reviews here won't be able to experience that.

I echo another reviewer; don't Google, don't read the reviews, don't even glance at IMDB before watching.

Line of Duty series 3 is an excellent thriller.  The plot logic tends to fall apart if you think about it, but it's a terrific ride with excellent characterization and performances.",1472083200,3,861,4.979020979020979

7739169,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"LINE OF DUTY Series 3 is as powerful a piece of police-themed entertainment as I've ever seen.  Series 1 was incredible and Series 2 bested it.  Now Series 3 has come along--with huge expectations from fans of the show--and it's at least as good, if not better, than the first two series.

One of the brilliant aspects of the show is that writer Jed Mercurio (don't you love that name?  It's not made up, either) chooses to introduce a new main character with each series.  In Series 3 a brilliant young actor named Daniel Mays plays the leader of an elite police unit that uses firearms and responds to particularly violent emergencies.

Mays is the backbone for a significant chunk of the story.  Of course LINE OF DUTY regulars Martin Compston and Vicky McClure are on hand to investigate police corruption, along with their superiors Adrian Dunbar and Craig Parkinson.  Once they enter the story the focus shifts, stakes are raised and the level of tension heightens.  Throw into the mix the return of Keeley Hawes from Series 2--a quite unexpected turn of events--and you've got the makings of television drama at its very best.

The plot is intricately spun and will not be referenced here (not the reviewer's job, say I).  Suffice to say that the drama is superb, the action positively cathartic and the acting and production details are exemplary.

One aspect in particular stands out for this reviewer.  In virtually every police drama there are scenes set in the interview room.  Some of the interrogation scenes in this almost seven hour production are very long, something like 25 minutes in some cases.  On the Behind-the-Scenes featurette one actor refers to these scenes as ""mini plays"" and he's right on the money.  These scenes alone are full of dynamic dialogue, outstanding drama and powerful revelation.  It's an extraordinary achievement when you consider interrogation room scenes are so commonplace in police shows.  Here these scenes are anything but common.  It's not unlike watching a documentary that consists primarily of talking heads.  Generally this is a no no, following the dramatic mandate that in a film it is better to show than to tell.  But when what is being told and the manner in which it is told is just so inherently dramatic and interesting that nothing further is required, then talking heads are sufficient.

One of today's trends in home entertainment is binge watching.  LINE OF DUTY is entirely binge-worthy.  Try NOT watching the shows close together.  I don't think it's possible, not when the option of finding out what happens next is at hand.

And that leads to the already mounting anticipation for a fourth series...  Apparently it has been commissioned...  As with other top shows such as (currently) GEORGE GENTLY and (until recently) FOYLE'S WAR, I can hardly wait.",1471392000,11,2824,4.9258474576271185
7739170,5,B01ENSOKJQ,Excellent,1471392000,,9,9.0
7739171,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"Wow. This series gets better with each year. I loved series 1 (Lennie James), and series 2 (Keeley Hawes). This is not a typical police procedural, even though some critics have put it on par with ""Law and Order"". Jed Mercurio (Bodies with Max Beesley), the lead writer for Line of Duty, clearly envisioned a complex overall story arc for all seasons that is so fascinating it makes your head spin.

Following in the vein of ""The Wire"", and ""The Night Of"", this show follows an anti-corruption unit in a Londonesque city (similar to internal affairs in the U.S.) who investigate ""bent coppers"". I strongly recommend watching the first two series first. While technically each year a new storyline is introduced, what makes ""Line of Duty"" incredible is the details. What may seem insignificant the year before may or may not have a huge impact later on. Nothing is black and white, no one is perfect, no one is immune from corruption, and there are no clear lines between right and wrong.

I will admit, I stopped watching the first episode of series 3 initially within the first 15 minutes. The first ""bad cop"" was so smarmy I couldn't handle it. I am glad I kept watching.

It is clear the acting for several characters will be nominated for BAFTA. One person in particular (to include the name - spoilers!) gives their best performance to date. Incredible acting by supporting cast (in particular Jonas Armstrong, Maya Sondhi, Neil Morrissey, and George Costigan).

I read recaps after every show (The Guardian was especially helpful...the comments in particular).

*Edit* Just noticed other reviewers received copies of the DVDs in exchange for unbiased reviews. I did not receive anything. Just a normal review.

*Edit* I originally gave this show (overall) 4 stars because I felt it could not live up to other beloved series. Upon rewatching, I feel Series 3 deserves 5 stars. A show that stays with you AND can be viewed repeatedly is more than worthy of this review.",1471305600,,1973,4.822485207100592

7739175,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"I wrote a review after season 2 when I couldn't stop watching seasons  1and 2 --at that time I felt compelled to add a rave to a show I stumbled upon. Season three continues to keep me on the edge of my seat!  Briefly, the show follows a police internal investigatory unit as they review the fast-action police drama we see go down, as viewers. What is so different about this police drama from American ones, and makes it so fascinating, is that everyone --I mean everyone has secrets. No just black and white here, people either totally good or totally bad, and what a suspenseful ride we get as a result. Acting is fabulous; ditto writing.  And again as I wrote before, Keeley Hawes has outdone herself--  didn't even recognize her at first, but her performance in this show is utterly riveting. You might want to start with Season one to get the full arc.  No matter where you start --  just watch!!",1470614400,26,903,4.475609756097561
7739176,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"Line of Duty, Series 3, Martin Compston .  This BBC television series, a crime drama,  set in current-day Belfast, Northern Ireland; was broadcast on BBC2.  This powerful, critically acclaimed police procedural returns for six episodes of a third series.  The hit thriller continues to star Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott (Martin Compston, MONARCH OF THE GLEN, THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY) and Detective Constable Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure, BROADCHURCH, THE SECRET AGENT) on the trail of corrupt police officers.

Also back are  DSI Ted Hastings ( Adrian Dunbar, ASHES TO ASHES); enigmatic Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton with Keeley Hawes, (MI-5, ASHES TO ASHES) reprising her role from Series 2. The part of Gill, attorney attached to the unit, is introduced, as played by Polly Walker (ROME, PRISONERS WIVES). Sergeant Danny Waldron of the Armed Response Unit (Daniel Mays, THE GREAT FIRE, MRS. BIGGS) starts the action rolling as he unexpectedly, improperly shoots dead a criminal during a routine police raid. He is the leader of an elite unit; the AC-12 team begins examining his conduct. But Waldrons loyal team obstructs the investigation; the truth about the shooting proves more complicated than the cop shop could ever have imagined.

The acting is superb as the regulars acquit themselves memorably.  Mays performance is outstanding, powerful enough that he should be winning awards.  So is Keeley Hawes, who towered over season 2 of the production.  Hawes is clearly a very fine actress who perhaps began her film career  limited in the parts she was offered by her extreme prettiness, but now, as she settles into middle age, getting much meatier parts, which she fully inhabits.  The episodes are:

1. A criminal is shot dead by a police armed-response unit led by Sgt. Danny Waldron; AC-12 gathers evidence suggesting it was a deliberate killing rather than self-defense.
2. Waldron's armed-response unit comes under increasing scrutiny and again closes ranks. But AC-12 feeds new information to Kate that helps uncover cracks in the units story. Arnott makes a shocking discovery; his past catches up with him.
3. Two unit members tell the AC that another killed Danny Waldron, but the AC team is not convinced. Later one of the unit changes her story, incriminating another unit member in the deaths. As a result he goes on the run; the ACs Cottan is declared an unlikely hero. Steve finds a man who was in care with Waldron; discovers that they were abused at a home for boys, whose staff numbered the Murphys,  two recent victims. Lindsay's retrial reaches its conclusion.
4. Fresh testimony sends AC-12 back to investigate the Caddy,  theorized corrupt officer with links to organized crime.
5. AC-12's loyalties are divided when Arnott comes under scrutiny from his colleagues.
6. Arnott is arrested on suspicion of murder, continues to protest his innocence. Fleming's undercover operation unveils unexpected facts.

The box series, which I received for review purposes, consists of three discs containing six episodes for approximately 401 minutes.  It has a 20-minute behind the scenes featurette and a photo gallery. Subtitles, of course, though most of the performers are speaking the Queens English loud and clear.  As you might expect, this tense and gritty detective show contains coarse language, graphic violence, sexual content, nudity, disturbing images. It also can be shocking. So, not for the squeamish or family viewing.  But it would be a shame to miss this show, riveting from its first explosive scenes to its last unexpected twists.  They don't make many like this.",1470441600,4,3609,5.189655172413793
7739177,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"First off, I would think that those coming to this review of the THIRD series of this mystery series (produced in Ireland for the commercial ITV Network in 2015 and broadcast on  the BBC) have already seen Series 1 &2. (If not, I apologize, but highly recommend that you start with Series One so you can watch the characters develop. And  no spoiler here  a previous character returns) So I won't repeat info from the first season. And this is a mystery series  and those who have read my other Amazon reviews know that I detest spoilers  or reviews that give away too much of the plot  so I will provide very little plot info here. The fun of a mystery is not knowing what will happen.

There are 6 episodes in this season and they vary in length from 61 to 90 minutes (for a total of 6 hr. 40 minutes. This is one continuous story (with a cliffhanger at the end of each

There is graphic violence and strong language. I doubt that the series will be un PBS here. There would need to be a lot of editing for the violent images.

Again, if youve seen the earlier series (if not, return to my first sentence above), you know that this is about the Internal Investigations Unit of ta police department. And  again no spoiler here  there are some rotten apples in on the force and they have to be fleshed out. Who is good and who isn't is the crux of the story and I will NOT tell you any more about it.

Im looking at some of the reviews already posted and Im seeing way too much being revealed that is not necessary and gives away too much. (Why do reviewer who have seen mysteries give so much info and spoil the fun for others.?)I even urge you to get the DVD (its great show) but, when you choose an episode DO NOT read the text that shows up next. It is not a recap; it is a summary of what you will see next and DOES contain spoilers. Dont worry if you watch episodes separately. Each episode starts with a recap of what you have already seen (this plays during the opening credits).

There are two bonus features on the DVD. . The first is the now-requisite Behind-the Scenes featurette  in which you get to hear from the cast and crew and relive scenes. The other is photo gallery (a bonus I never quite understand; do people really watch these?)  And I also not to watch any of the bonuses before watching all the episodes. Too much is revealed in the featurette.

The DVD is not being released until August 9, 2016 but I was provided with an advance copy in exchange for an honest, and objective, review
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7739179,5,B01ENSOKJQ,"This crime suspense pits cops against cops. Bad cop, good cop, but when the bad are really baddies, it creates murder, action, and thriller scenes.  AC-12 (anti-corruption unit) fights against dirty cop acts. As in reality, only a minor part of the force is bent and bad. You may turn your head from graphic scenes, but you cant stop viewing. Writing is layered allowing for great character development, and presented on both the professional and personal fronts. A BBC hit with a dark side.
One story evolves over 6.5 hours of hi-suspense feature rather than 6 individual episodes. Complex plot, sub-plots, and characters maintain edge-of-the-seat scary for hours and keep you guessing. Not for kids. A nightmare producer if there ever was one.

Keeley Hawes (Upstairs, Downstairs Wives & Daughters), returns as convict Lindsay Denton. Returning boss is DS Hastings (Adrian Dunbar). DC Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), DI Cottan (Craig Parkinson), DS Arnott (Martin Compston Monarch of the Glen) also return as the AC-12 team. Polly Walker plays new character Gill Bigelow, AC-12 legal counsel. DS Sam Railston (Aiysha Hart) is Arnotts female flatmate.

SDH SUBTITLES provided in all 6 episodes & Behind Scenes bonus. I couldn't stop watching, as good as or better than the 6-star second season.
== 1 ==A suspect shot in Operation Damson police raid under Sgt Waldron (Daniel Mays) command gets AC-12 investigating. A story like todays newspaper headline. Hastings & Arnott question police standards use. DC Kate goes undercover for answers.

== 2 ==The armed-response unit closes ranks again after a 2nd questionable shooting death. Bad coppers? New revelations about Arnotts undercover past surface and haunt as a result of court testimony related to previously convicted DI Dentons case, a prime focus from season 2 [dont miss that DVD set.]

== 3 ==Who killed a cop? Arnott looks deeper into victims histories; ugly violent pasts. There is changed testimony, Kates yet undercover, Cottan a hero [?], and another cop does a runner.

== 4 ==Freed Denton wants retribution while Arnott & Hastings are busy with interrogations. Are they somehow linked? Organized crimes cop link known as Caddy resurfaces from the past.

== 5 ==Arnott inquiries turn against him. AC-12 appears to possess a corruption linkbut who?

== 6 ==Retired cop corruption may lead to current cases. Kate's undercover work exposes surprises. Action fans will love the fast, violent, brutal, dramatic conclusion in the Line of Duty.",1468454400,9,2501,5.203980099502488
