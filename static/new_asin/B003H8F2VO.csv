8396919,5,B003H8F2VO,"I have always loved Dirty Jobs, and collection six is more filthy excellence in a continuing line of excrementally nasty occupational explorations from Mike Rowe. I think Mike is a true American hero because he looks at things other people do for a living and is always polite and never demeaning while making sure he gets exposed to the elemental core of each job with no thought of the sanitary conditions involved: if others are doing it, he does it. It's always interesting trying to pick which jobs will be the worst, because many times the jobs that seem like they'd be not too bad have a dark underside you'd just never expect (like ""Soo Locks Technician"").

In this collection I particularly enjoyed ""Marble Maker"" which features Mike's jaunt to Kauai to make the dirtiest shirts I have ever seen (as well as making marbles), and ""Animal Control Specialist which demonstrates why people with claustrophobia need not apply. (Bonus: Mike gets sprayed by a skunk.)

I really like Dirty Jobs, and find it entertaining, unassuming, and educational. This is a great set!",1480636800,,1072,4.884615384615385
