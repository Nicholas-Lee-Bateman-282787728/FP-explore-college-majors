I love this series. I've tried watching the US version, made it through three, but it just didn't have the same feel as the original. The Gallagher's are more dysfunctional than my own family...which I didn't think was possible. I've laughed out loud to this show on every episode, This is a great group of actors and I'd watch it again and again!",1436313600,,536,4.36
