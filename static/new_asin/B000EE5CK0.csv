If you grew up on Alabama in the 80s, like i did, chances are you read Kathryn Tucker Windham's 13 ghosts and jeffery books over and over. Kathryn, a Alabama native herself, is a wonderful writer of folk lore, but where she truly excels, is storytelling. I am so glad there is footage of her telling stories on this documentary, because to hear this woman was mesmerizing. She was greatly loved, and her passing was deeply mourned by people all over the south. I purchased this movie to keep a little piece of her in my heart, and to let my son hear her speak. He was just as touched as I was . I attended a storytelling at Halloween located at Birmingham's Sloss furnaces as a child, and the memory of this sweet lady endures today. I urge you to purchase this movie and her books to keep her spirit alive.",1462233600,,848,4.30625
