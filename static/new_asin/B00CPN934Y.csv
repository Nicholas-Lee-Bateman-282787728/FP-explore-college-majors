5732846,3,B00CPN934Y,thanks wiggles thanks alot. cock robin and i want to suck it now (cranberry juice) in one dvd. This one will not be played again. My kids unfortunately loved it and it has beautiful dancing sequences  BUT I can't risk my kids going to school however innocently signing either song. HOW anthony wiggle do you explain signing off on a song called i want to suck the cranberry juice...? I will highly recommend Surfer Jeff with 5 stars.,1379548800,,433,4.551282051282051
5732847,4,B00CPN934Y,"This latest Wiggles video has lot of great songs -- probably even better than Taking Off or Furry Tales. Pretty much every song is catchy, and the new cast is great. The videos from the new generation have been pretty low-budget as they push them out quickly, but the quality of songs hasn't dropped.

One gripe with this one: they did a traditional English song called ""Who Killed Cock Robin?"" The lyrics about killing and death are unexpected from The Wiggles, and I skip the song so mu 3-year-old doesn't hear them. Might be a 5-star video if that song had been omitted.",1379376000,2,573,4.563106796116505
5732848,4,B00CPN934Y,My 3 and a half year old daughter loves The Wiggles and I love that I can put it on for her and know she is going to do a lot of moving and get her energy out.  This was our first experience with the new Wiggles and my daughter loves that there is a girl in the group now.  The halloween theme is really cute and my daughter loves watching it and singing along.  My one complaint is that there are quite a few slower songs included so she isn't up and moving as much as I would like.  But she likes it and it keeps her attention so that is good enough for me.,1378598400,7,559,3.793103448275862
5732849,5,B00CPN934Y,"This DVD is adorable beyond words! If you already love anything Wiggles, obviously you'll love this too. But even if you're skeptical of these new ones, perhaps simply against the change, worried your kids won't take to them, whatever your reason,then this is the DVD to get! There's no way you or your kids won't LOVE this! It's sure to warm you up to them! It's just packed with too much cuteness, fun, & talent to pass up. We got ours at the show, but it will be released here in U.S. soon & I highly recommend! Also great to prepare kids for Halloween if you're worried about them being easily spooked. Highlights the fun in the traditions and costumes & portrays what may be perceived as scary to be fun & friendly. We also own & love ""Taking Off!"" & recommend that too! It can't be easy having to find three new members at once, but they couldn't have found any three better and are doing just a fantastic job!!!",1377561600,4,918,4.374269005847953

5732881,3,B00CPN934Y,"Let me start by saying that my 3-year-old daughter loved watching this, and I have no doubt that she would give it 5 stars if she were the one rating it. I teetered between giving it 3 or 4. I couldn't give it 5 because I find it annoying, but it is clean and encourages singing and dancing which I do feel are important for kids. But 4 would be too many because as a parent, there were two songs I did not like for my child. The first was the song about little vampires. They drink cranberry juice instead of blood which is great, but the lyrics and demanding motions portrayed in the dance came across as bratty and entitled. If my kid wants juice and screams to have it ""NOW! NOW! NOW!"", she is getting water and a talk about manners. The other song that I didn't care for was ""Who Killed Cock Robin?"". It seemed really misplaced on the show and wasn't something I felt my child could grasp. It was also disturbing to see the way Simon smiled while singing about death.

This was our first time watching The Wiggles. It is pretty corny and I almost felt embarrassed for the performers a couple of times. Then I stopped being a grouchy old turd and realized how awesome it is that they are willing to be that goofy and put themselves out there like that. They make a lot of children very happy and undoubtedly give a lot of parents a bit of a break by entertaining their kids. They also probably make tons more money than I do and are maybe even really happy with their jobs. So even though I find them over the top ridiculous, I am also a little jealous!",1445644800,,1557,4.224832214765101

5732909,5,B00CPN934Y,"We just love the new wiggles!  I've watched them since the very beginning when Greg, then Sam and now Emma, is the yellow wiggle.  Emma is so spunky and fun to watch, captain feathersword (he's the original along with Anthony) still is that clumsy and goofy captain we love to giggle with.  This DVD has some of the catchiest songs, our favorite is the ""Cranberry Juice"" vampire song. Yes, its little kids dressed in vampire costumes asking for more cranberry juice to suck (though they are drinking it from cups with straws, hence sucking on the straws) do we need to read so much into that, you are buying a ""halloween"" themed DVD. Look at it as getting your children to drink cranberry juice. Don't mosquitoes do that? oh, they're the bloodsuckers, we'll just skip that topic.  My kids get a kick out of when Emma is wearing the red beard and loves her ""Billy bat"" song.
Yes, the ""Cock Robin"" song I didn't get, but my european husband explained it as how we would explain how a funeral goes about. Again halloween and graveyards and the poor death of cock robin by the sparrow. Anthony explains in the beginning that it is an old english tale, because we americans will jump on the ""death"" part and OMG, did he say ""killed cockrobin"", maybe they should have sang about ""Humpty Dumpty"" instead. Again, no need to read so much into it, they are an international group and apparently others get it, we just skip it cause its a slow song.
Now my favorite is the ""Witchy Woo"" she likes sandwiches too! I'm assuming it is not a gluten free bread, doh! Hopefully I didn't get them in trouble :)
Overall an awesome DVD, if you like to celebrate Halloween. If not Veggie Tales has a great DVD. We don't believe in what Halloween celebrates but we do use the day as a way to be silly and fun and a teaching experience that helps them not to be afraid of death, the dark and monsters in costumes. Maybe thats where ""Twinkle Twinkle"" comes in, to not be afraid of the dark outside, just look for the stars. So get this and have a wiggly good time with your family and friends.",1421884800,,2068,4.41994750656168

I feel as though the Wiggly Halloween is not appropriate for young children (4 years old and 2 years) and extremely disappointed.  The first (maybe second) song lyrics are I want to ""suck cranberry juice now now now"" Yes they are dressed up as vampires but I don't want my child to be repeating words like ""now"" or teach them to be demanding  or use the word suck in a normal vocabulary. Some of the songs can be somewhat scary for little ones.  My 2 year old does not need to see the wiggles dressed like zombies and have fake blood etc on them.  I understand it is a halloween dvd and different people censor their kids television programs differently, but for at least my kids this was not somthing I would want them to watch.",1416528000,,883,4.321212121212121

5732923,3,B00CPN934Y,"My two year old son has recently been introduced to The Wiggles.  I don't mind playing their videos for him, but this one gives me pause.

Wiggly Halloween has excellent production value, and the Wiggles are always smiling and full of energy, which is what I like about them.  But this compilation has some really weird songs, and I am confused about the selection.

One of the songs is a very old song from England called Cock Robin.  It is a long, awkward and haunting tune about a murder taking place, and the efforts of the other animals to observe a funeral for the slain bird.  I feel like this might not have been an appropriate choice to include the song, given that they are targeting a diversely international audience.  It's even pre-faced with an explanation by Anthony wiggle who says that the song is old, and points out twice that it comes from England, as if that matters.  I half expected them to launch into another old timey children's classic about the bubonic plague before the credits rolled after that.  I definitely take notice when my child's entertainment starts to sing to him about catching spilled blood and death shrouds.  Holy cow.

There are a few songs that are just plain weird.  One of the first is a song about a group of children implied to be vampires who are demanding cranberry juice.  It's just a very weird song performed by the red Wiggle who has these very forced facial expressions and a super deep voice.  It's a little unsettling.

Some songs just feel totally out of place.  At one point, the Wiggles perform this beautiful rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, complete with ballerina dancers.  But what does it have to do with Halloween?  There is also a song about a girl on the moon that feels like it doesn't belong.

Aside from Cock Robin, I didn't feel like anything was particularly bad viewing for my son.  A lot of the songs are so full of energy and fun.  Just go into this expecting some weird content.",1414454400,,1966,4.5759312320916905

5732926,3,B00CPN934Y,"The Wiggles are a great way to introduce your kids to music and how fun and exciting it can be! The new group of Wiggles, which now includes a girl seems to really be connecting with kids, and their fun music and antics makes for a great addition to any home.

Recently, the group of Wiggles - Anthony, Emma, Lachy and Simon released a DVD for that fits well with fall and the upcoming Halloween season. Wiggly Halloween is a fun-filled DVD that includes a collection of both new and favorite Halloween tunes. As always, the Wiggles make music so much fun and they give kids a great opportunity to dance, sing along and simply get involved with the music. The Wiggly Halloween DVD is no exception.

From a personal stand-point, there were a few songs on the DVD that we did not enjoy quite as much as others. Since it is a Halloween themed DVD, it is understandable that songs including monsters, vampires, etc. might be included...but for us, those are topics that we do not encourage our children to learn about, dwell on, think about or sing about. They do make a good effort to turn something that may be scary for children into something fun, so I did appreciate that, even it was a topic that we do not like to focus on in our home.

Overall, Wiggly Halloween is a great DVD for kids - especially if you do not mind the few songs that may touch on some of the more controversial parts of Halloween.

I really like ""Mumbles the Monster"" and ""Skeleton Skat"" though.",1412726400,,336,4.21875

My Review:

 It that time of year again, when the leaves change color and the weather gets cooler and we get ready for all the great holidays that are set to arrive. Fall is by far my most favorite time of the year and I have to say it's just not long enough.  And my children like most children absolutely love Halloween, we always try to attend a harvest festival, go trick or treating , and buy some candy for them to enjoy at home. I think my children enjoy dressing up better than any of those listed above. Our youngest, our 4 year old is really excited this year about all the upcoming holidays. We are just as excited because this will be the first year that he knows what is going on and can really enjoy it.

 Wiggly Halloween is part of the celebration as well. He is so into songs right now and singing&The Wiggles are his favorite! Wiggly Halloween includes a Halloween celebration like no other. The Wiggles really do it up BIG this time with 20 great songs that get you in the Halloween mood such as Pumpkin Face, Mumbles the Monster, and Three Little Pumpkins plus many more. This awesome spine tingling DVD is available online now and at your local retailers. Suggested retail price is $6.99 and is available at this link for quick ordering.

5732930,2,B00CPN934Y,"Not really a favorite around the house. My daughter has many other Wiggles DVDs, including the newer DVDs with these guys and hardly picks this one. I personally find a lot of the songs annoying (Billy Bat makes me leave the room, I can't deal with Emma's squealing), but one or two are catchy. My little girl LOVES Mumbles the Monster though. There are a couple of songs that you can tell there's lip synching but nothing a kid would catch. Not the best, I'm back and forth with these Wiggles.",1410307200,,494,4.43956043956044

It is scary and has songs and lyrics that are not appropriate. I do not want my 3 year old going to school saying suck. I let her watch about 20 minutes and turned it off.

I loved that it wasn't presented in a scary manner and that actually helped him be somewhat ""matter of fact"" about seeing some scary decorations on neighboring houses. (He had no context for the decorations to be scary.) Can't wait to pull it back out for him next year!",1384473600,,446,4.321428571428571

She was dancing right along with the music throughout almost every song, and especially loved to do the skeleton  I was even able to get her dancing to it on video doing the owl and shared the fun with our whole family. This will be watched again and again this week as Halloween keeps getting closer! We get requests for Halloween wiggles almost every day. I THINK she is a little excited.

My boys (4 aand 6) haven't sat down long enough to watch The Wiggle before, but since their sisters were watching, they decided to. Everyone loved it! Cadance (9) loved that the new girl Wiggle wears yellow, which is her favorite color. Heaven was disappointed that it wasn't all the same Wiggles as she was used to, but she said they were still great. We don't have a lot of Halloween themed DVDs, so that was a definite plus.

This fun-filled new DVD, Wiggly Halloween, is just the perfect mix of Halloween songs and silliness to get Braxton excited for Halloween!

The new Wiggles line-up brought back goldie oldies like, ""Do The Owl"" and ""Rockabye Your Bear.""  New songs include ""I Vant To Drink My Cranberry Juice"" and ""Zombie Feet.""  The thrust of this collection seems to be helping small children get past their fears.  The message is clear.  Don't be afraid.  It's only an owl.  Just put on some make-up and a costume and go get your candy.  It's fun.",1381536000,,513,4.489130434782608

5732975,4,B00CPN934Y,"We are getting all geared up for Halloween at my house which means crafts, food, fun, festivities, and our favorite Halloween DVDs. We are quite pleased this year to add the newest Wiggles DVD ""Wiggly Halloween"" to our collection of must watch in October! My kids have long been Wiggle fans (practically since birth... my daughter 5 1/2 years and my son nearly 3!) so they were pretty excited about this DVD!

On the Wiggly Halloween DVD there are twenty Halloween inspired songs. My kids favorites were Skeleton Scat, Three Little Pumpkins, Zombie Feet, & Trick or Treat. Most of the songs are upbeat, catchy, and a lot fun. I appreciate the fun approach instead of spooky and scary take on the holiday. This DVD I'm sure will help kids transition into the holiday be prepared for whatever they might see knowing that it's all in good fun.

I will have to say I disliked the Little Vampire Song on the DVD. The song is about little vampires that prefer Cranberry juice over blood. But the the lyrics bug me (I want to suck the cranberry juice now now now. ). My little one has been repeating partial lyrics after hearing the song and that can be taken in a bad way. I also didn't think the song Who Killed Cock Robin belonged on a DVD for kids. I'd think it'd confuse kids about death and murder and it just seems an odd addition to the collection. A few of the songs seemed just out of place but overall not a bad addition to our Wiggles collection.

Bonus features include ""Ready, Steady, Wiggle! Tv series episode - Twinkle, Twinkle!"" & a photo gallery of all The Wiggles Characters. My kids liked the bonuses and I was a fan of the Jukebox feature where I could go pick which song I wanted played instead of needing to watch the DVD all the way through, especially since there will be some songs I'll be skipping over.",1381363200,8,1823,4.452095808383233
5732976,4,B00CPN934Y,"Have you seen the new cast of the Wiggles?  Anthony is the only returning cast member from the original bunch.  In addition to Anthony, there is now a girl, Emma, along with Lachy and Simon.  While my kids still miss not seeing their favorite Wiggles, they are starting to get into the new Wiggles show.  And, this past weekend, on our way to pick pumpkins, I put this Halloween-themed DVD on for them, to get them in the mood.  With a 60 minute run time, this DVD includes 20 Halloween inspired songs, as well as a photo gallery and fun ""Ready, Steady, Wiggle! TV Series episode, ""Twinkle, Twinkle!,"" which has become my girls' favorite Wiggles episode. :-)

If this DVD does not get you and your little ones excited about Halloween, pumpkins, etc., then I don't know what will.  My husband and I found ourselves singing ""Pumpkin Face"" and ""Trick or Treat"" on the return ride home, as the girls asked to watch this DVD again.  Be warned, the songs are very catchy, and will have your child laughing, smiling and singing along in no time.  This is definitely one Halloween-themed DVD we will be watching a few more times this year, and for many more years to come.

Disclosure: I was sent a copy of this DVD from the vendor in order to write up an honest review.  The views shared are mine and mine alone.",1381190400,,1305,4.4641350210970465

We don't own many of their DVDs because we watch their show on Sprout but figured this one was a purchase-worthy one because my son loves Halloween.  This DVD is cute and the tunes are catchy but a little odd.  I am not complaining of length or content per se but the songs are not very well known to me or anyone in my family who has seen this.  I guess it still did the trick for my son though because he asks to watch it at least once a week and sings a few of the songs after its over.  As for me, I think its a cute DVD but it would have been a bit nicer to hear songs I'd heard before (either on their show or just in general).

My children were so enamored with the ""new"" Wiggles that they only wanted to watch that DVD.  I was wary about a Halloween DVD as I just didn't see how it could not be campy.

I was wrong.  The songs are surprisingly sophisticated and the performers execute them well.  Once again, I am especially impressed by Simon and Emma and Lachy is far stronger here than he is in ""Taking Off.""  The production value on this DVD is as good as it is on any of their other DVD's.

Halloween can lead to some touchy subject matter for kids, but the Wiggles walk that line well.  This is definitely one that will be brought out year after year for us!",1380326400,,885,5.183098591549296

I see one that said there kid was scared of the wolf or the songs are in inappropriate. The wolf song and wolf is about how hairy and fun he is, he even uses a cell phone, lol. Suck the cranberry juice song is odd but its funny to me and dad. Son thinks its silly too. Halloween is scary or to be a little frightening.
