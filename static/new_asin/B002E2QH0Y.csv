8366698,5,B002E2QH0Y,"Remember The Alamo! Synapse Films has taken us on a journey to the past through their superb 42nd Street Forever collections, and this edition proves to be the best yet. Exploitation films tend to not get a lot of love from the more stuff shirt film historians. Said historians often brush them aside as cheap smut that has no artistic or cultural merit. I vehemently disagree, but this is a review of a product, not grounds for an academic debate.

Alamo Drafthouse Cinema have proudly put their stamp on this DVD edition, but not just in name only. Many of these fantastic trailers are culled from the hallowed halls of AGFA (American Genre Film Archive), a non-profit storage and restoration house for 35mm cult films, some of which are available ONLY in that format. As such, some of the trailers on the DVD have poor quality, but I wouldn't say they ""suffer"" from it. If anything, the deterioration, discolorations, pops, fizzles, and crackles only add to the flavor and the experience.

Watching these trailers really does take you through a window of time, to an era FAR different than the film climate of today. Countless researchers, fans, buffs, and historians have expounded on that point in time, and with words and love that shame any attempt I could make to do the same. Simply put, these trailers are fascinating to watch. The sheer brashness, boldness, and indeed political incorrectness is a sight to behold. Having actually seen a few of the full-length movies whose trailers are compiled on here, it's worth noting that the marketing for films hasn't changed much for the last 50 or so years. Some of the movies would live up to the ""promise"" of the trailers, others would deviate in ways good, bad, and strange.

It doesn't matter if you're a scholar or someone looking for some fun. This DVD provides entertainment for folks of many walks of life. There's also some great special features, for anyone who could, for some strange reason, be bored with what's on display here. There's a running commentary track by Tim League, founder and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, co-founder and co-creator of Fantastic Fest, in addition to being the man responsible for AGFA, along with Alamo programmers Lars Nilsen and Zack Carlson. While they do have a few yuks with the trailers, they also discuss how they acquired some of the trailers, the process for restoration, and which are some of their favorites to screen at Alamo locations. There's also a 30-minute docu titled ""Remember The Alamo"" that provides a peak at some of the Texas locations. There are interviews not just with League, but employees and guests. It shows the fantastic film community that develops among everyone, demonstrating that Alamo Drafthouse is one of THE penultimate film theaters in this country. For some of you out there who fret about the lack of an Alamo in their town, worry not. I'm a Yonkers resident, and just last year my nirvana opened in my city. There are plans for CA locations as well. So if an Alamo can open in a Westchester County city, then by god they can open ANYWHERE. In the meantime, enjoy this plethora of cinematic delights. You won't regret it. Of that I can guaran-damn-tee.",1413763200,4,3194,4.803636363636364
8366699,4,B002E2QH0Y,"The whole throwback to exploitation/grindhouse thing has been raging strongly for several years now, and honestly, you just never know what you're going to end up getting. Sometimes it's a lot of unremembered softcore sex flicks from the '60s; sometimes forgotten hard-core from the '70s; other times it's just foolishly mislabeled and is either edited hard-core or misdiagnosed soft-core from a far more recent era (I've even seen '90s stuff labeled as ""grindhouse"").

This is a collection of trailers that ahead of time, I had expected would be hard-core. After all, that's what you should expect given the ""42nd Street"" tag, because that's what 42nd Street in New York was noted for. As it turns out there is no hard-core on it and by and large, there is no grindhouse fare. Very little sexploitation even. So I was a little disappointed in that.

However, what IS here is highly entertaining--Grade Z movies, drive-in legends and exploitation films of all kinds, more than 40 trailers in all. Plus lots of fun little calls to go to the concession stand and other fillers along the way. The best part is the voice-over commentary from the operators of the Alamo Draft House theater who compiled  these  particular  selections for the DVD.

Overall an excellent title.",1388448000,,1270,4.966981132075472

8366701,5,B002E2QH0Y,"If you're new to this series, start with Volume 5. It's the most entertaining of all, and it will be the best gauge for you to decide if you'd like to expand your collection with volumes 1 through 4. Volume 1 is no slouch, but from the very beginning (""Chuck"" Heston explaining the MPAA rating system while playing tennis) Volume 5 is pure entertainment.

Another bonus is that the trailers are clustered together by genre; so, for example, if you don't like the Kung fu trailers, you can just skip ahead a few chapters and you'll be on to new territory.",1310342400,8,554,4.485148514851486
8366702,5,B002E2QH0Y,"This fifth volume in the glorious '42nd St. Forever' series of tawdry, trashy, tacky, transgressive trailers focuses on the Grand Ole Opry of southern Grindhouse cinema, the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Texas. The Lone Star state is considered to be the 'New York of the South' (and good ol' boys don't mean that as praise), and one need look no further for proof than to watch the trailers assembled in this demented collection for evidence. One of the last flag waving bastions of grindhouse glory, The Alamo hosts the Quentin Tarantino Film Fest and the Butt-Numb-A-Thon revivals, making it the equivalent of the Cannes Film or Sundance Festival of cinematic sleaze and celluloid sickness.

In this heartwarming salute to the Texan temple of trash, we are treated to many a great bad film; dozens of degrading, degenerative and dumpster-diving drivel that any seasoned sleazehound could ever hope for in this life. (My hope is that the afterlife is even more rewarding in this area, but I've always been a dreamer...). And an added perk in this collection is that the film genres are primarily grouped together, so if you're a kung-fu, Sonny Chiba-loving fool you've got a slew of such sashimi slices presented back to back - if not, the fast forward button becomes your best friend. Then comes the insanely depraved Eurohorror offerings that are long on nekkidness and short on scares, some decadent Danish sex comedy flesh-feasts, a fistful of low-budget action and sci-fi fiascos, a peppering of laughable sword and sandal or sorcery sludge, reel-ly ridiculous bad horror spin-offs you'll probably remember but wish you'd forgotten, a bevy of buffoonish American sex comedies that aren't any kind of funny though the nudity is noteworthy, then ya got yer Southern-fried rope'em, race'em, ride'em and ransack'em relics from those pre-PC days when Americans stood proudly while driving souped-up gas-guzzlers at unlawful speeds, off-road and through mud rivers while blatantly likkered up, and finally there's a cache of kiddie flicks cobbled together by someone on acid that represent some of the most bizarre previews here. So if you're a fan of cheesy trailers and bad films done badly, bare-knuckled brawling and bare-breasted babes, films that'll inflict damage, leave scars and promote mind rot, you've struck the mother lode, brethren. And there's more, friends, like ads for lobby food you wouldn't eat on a dare, a death wish or after a week with your mouth sewn shut. Yes indeed, kick back and revisit the 'good ol' days', for a splendid time is guaranteed for all... ""Remember the Alamo!""",1297555200,2,2601,5.091334894613583

The first review here makes me realize how good we have it with the Alamo (actually Alamos; there's a bunch in town now). We've been watching random collections of clips just like this before most every showing of any movie since the original Alamo on 4th was crankin' in the '90s, and I've just always taken it for granted and assumed that every town has a rep theatre that does stuff like this.

I guess not! For that we can say thanks to the Alamo founders, Tim and Carrie League, and all the film freaks who put these things together. They done good, and continue to do it.

This collection really shows off the endless amount of cinematic cheese that has surfaced from the primordial b-movie auteur muck and then disappeared over the decades. And believe it, there's lots more stuff like this in the Alamo vaults! I've seen some reeeeally obscure stuff in the previews, and with luck there'll be another Alamo dvd (or three) in this series.

Sex! Murder!! Mayhem!!! Coming soon to a drive-in near you...",1260230400,12,1019,4.613259668508287
8366704,5,B002E2QH0Y,"Synapse's 42nd St Forever trailer comps have always been insanely entertaining but I have to concur with the previous reviewer when he says this volume ups the ante. This is without a doubt the most ""out there"" of the series -- well, except for maybe the XXX one. I haven't even heard of half of these films (esp. the kung fu titles -- whoa, check out that underage face plant at the end of LUCKY SEVEN!) but I guarantee if you like this sort of thing, you won't be disappointed. I even enjoyed the commentary.",1257811200,7,510,4.378947368421053
