8366278,4,B002DY9KU2,"You get 10 great playoff games (each on their own DVD). There are five Game 7's, three Game 6's, one Game 5, and one Game 3. The games are in standard definition (a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original television exhibition). My only complaint is that no special features (interviews, bonus supplements) are provided.

1981 Quarter-Final, Game 7 vs. the Philadelphia Flyers (Bob Cole & Gary Dornhoefer)
1986 Quarter-Final, Game 7 vs. the Edmonton Oilers (Steve Smith own goal game; Don Wittman & Gary Dornhoefer)
1986 Semi-Final, Game 7 vs. the St. Louis Blues (Dan Kelly & Ron Reusch)
1989 1st round, Game 7 vs. the Vancouver Canucks (Bob Cole & John Garrett)
1989 Final, Game 6 vs. the Montreal Canadiens (Bob Cole & Harry Neale)
1991 1st round, Game 6 vs. the Edmonton Oilers (Theoren Fleury crazy celebration goal; Chris Cuthbert & Jim Peplinski)
2004 1st round, Game 7 vs. the Vancouver Canucks (Dave Strader & Brian Engblom)
2004 Quarter-Final, Game 6 vs. the Detroit Red Wings (Don Wittman & Glen Healy)
2004 Final, Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Lightning (Bob Cole & Harry Neale)
2008 1st round, Game 3 vs. the San Jose Sharks (Mark Lee & Craig Simpson)

Buy this DVD. It is now out of print but well worth it to track down a copy as it has held its value. Eagerly awaiting Volume II.",1379808000,,1301,4.603448275862069
8366279,4,B002DY9KU2,I really love watching these games. Just want people to know there not the most exciting games in history. Probably the most significant tho.,1349222400,,141,4.916666666666667
8366280,3,B002DY9KU2,"Given the info is lacking on the listing, I'll help Flames fans out, if you're considering buying this. Here're the games in the box set (and I'm not using the dopey NHL's Conference Semi-Final, Divisional Final nonsensial overblown series monikers) with the announcers (all games the Canadian CBC or CTV telecast bar the 2004 Canuck one which was the ESPN2 'cast):

1981 Quarter-Final, Game 7 vs. the Philadelphia Flyers (Bob Cole & Gary Dornhoefer)
1986 Quarter-Final, Game 7 vs. the Edmonton Oilers (the Steve Smith own goal game--Don Wittman & Gary Dornhoefer)
1986 Semi-Final, Game 7 vs. the St. Louis Blues (Dan Kelly & Ron Reusch)
1989 1st round, Game 7 vs. the Vancouver Canucks (Bob Cole & John Garrett)
1989 Final, Game 6 vs. the Montreal Canadiens (Bob Cole & Harry Neale)
1991 1st round, Game 6 vs. the Edmonton Oilers (the Theoren Fleury crazy celebration goal--Chris Cuthbert & Jim Peplinski)
2004 1st round, Game 7 vs. the Vancouver Canucks (Dave Strader & Brian Engblom)
2004 Quarter-Final, Game 6 vs. the Detroit Red Wings (Don Wittman & Glen Healy)
2004 Final, Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Lightning (Bob Cole & Harry Neale)
2008 1st round, Game 3 vs. the San Jose Sharks (Mark Lee & Craig Simpson)

The title of the box set is ""10 Great Games"" so they are not the ""greatest"" games but at least they should be exciting and entertaining you'd think. The choices are more the ""10 Significant Games"" as after watching some they are not all that great.

Although, the first year in Calgary brought an unexpected run (with Pat Riggin in goal!) to the semi-finals, the clinching game in the quarter-finals is a penalty-filled borefest in Philly. A better game from that series was Game 2 which the Flames won 5-4 in front of those rabid Philly fans.

Now the 1986 upset of the powerhouse Oilers features one of the greatest games of all-time (a real Air Hockey '80s Battle of Alberta classic) not many fans realize the better overall series was in 1984. I'd like to have seen the Game 2 and 6 from '84 both thrilling OT wins for Calgary 6-5 in Edmonton and 5-4 at home respectively.

The '86 Game 7 vs. the Blues was more significant than great although it is a close game. Worse is the poor picture quality on this disc. It's almost unwatchable.

That's another minus point the game that should be the piece de resistance given it was the one where the Flames won the Cup in the old Forum in Montreal has the WORST pic quality of the lot. It's not a sharp picture at all. Many hockey fans do realize the morons at the CBC did tape over many of the master tapes of Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts and the NHL relies on home taping collectors for some of its archival games but they really couldn't have found, or enhanced, this game's video picture?

Anyway, it's a ""good"" rather than ""great"" set of games. Although this was heartbreak for the defending Stanley Cup champions, I'd like to have seen the 1990 Game 6 double-OT game vs. the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings here. It's such a wild game and features plenty of controversial goal/no-goal calls that it is really would have been a treat to see how the Flames really got jobbed that season.

There is one irony on the back cover of the box. Pictured are the team with the Cup in '89, Brad Marsh (captain of the '81 team), Al MacInnis, Joey Mullen, Lanny McDonald and Dion Phaneuf (who the Flames traded off to the Make Beliefs so...so much for being a potential Flame icon). But where is the captain and leader of the 2004 Final run Jarome Iginla? Given, as I write this in the fall of 2010, there is much criticism of his play as he ages and rumors of him on the trade block, it's almost eerie that they did not include him in the selection of player pics.

Ditto Theoren Fleury. All due respect to Joey Mullen but Fleury is more a Flame icon than the ex-Blue and ex-Penguin even if he was on the '89 Cup team, as was Fleury as a rookie.",1304726400,3,3910,4.503526093088857
8366281,4,B002DY9KU2,This is a great purchase if you are a fan just getting into hockey or a die-hard Flames fan!!! I read the other opinions before purchasing this DVD set but it is good if you love reliving the past and the many great playoff games they have been through. I recommend it highly especially if you can't get enough hockey action and especially for the off-season!,1301875200,,359,4.454545454545454
8366282,4,B002DY9KU2,"I just got this DVD set to honour the memory of my late father, who was a Flames fan since they were in Atlanta. It brought back alot of memories of some of the forgotten games that my father and I watched, especially the game against the Edmonton Oilers.",1258416000,,255,4.224489795918367
8366283,5,B002DY9KU2,"This is a great DVD set for any Calgary Flames fans with ten games, one on each disc.

Quality is very good considering the age of the earlier games, though disc 3 is a bit grainy. Commentaries are excellent but why was ESPN chosen for disc 7?

There are no special features: a short intro for each game would have been nice and maybe some interviews.

Beware that watching disc 9 against Tampa Bay, as good as it was, only serves to remind fans that the Flames did go on to lose the next two games and not win the Cup. That's why disc 5 is the precious one.

Enjoy!",1257897600,2,566,4.118181818181818
