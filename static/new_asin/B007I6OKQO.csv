5088771,5,B007I6OKQO,"I love this series.  It is a show you can watch with the whole family.  We are only in season 3 in the USA, so I had to purchase the complete series to see what has been shown and is coming up.  I am so excited about season 5, can't wait to get it also. Ty and Amy hopefully will FINALLY get together and STAY together.  Jack is a wonderful grandpa.  Lou, Mallory, Calab, Ash, Peter, Lisa and Val are also great.  Oh yes, Tim is the one you love to hate!!!!",1337644800,11,457,3.9130434782608696
5088772,3,B007I6OKQO,"I liked this season, but when I received it 2 discs were scratched and the person I bought it from and amazon wouldn't give me a refund or a new product. I'm disappointed that I spent a lot of money on a product where some discs don't work, and I should be entitled to get a new product because I paid for a brand new set of movies and some don't work.",1336176000,10,352,3.9027777777777777
5088773,4,B007I6OKQO,"Heartland is a nice family show with a caveat.  There are a lot of reviews that give it full thumbs up, but beware as there are a few shows with foul language in them and some content that could be appropriately discussed with younger children.  We really enjoy the show, but it's not perfect.

Also note that if you watched this show on Netflix, the quality was probably nice.  We had some quality issues with the DVD.  They are made well and the packaging looks nice, but the video quality was bad.  This appears to be due to some interlacing settings used in Canada (vs. the U.S.), so some VCRs may show horizontal lines and grainy video.  There is some PC based DVD software that can fix this (realtime).",1335916800,3,708,4.441860465116279
5088774,5,B007I6OKQO,"The Heartland series is well worth the cost of these DVDs. I rarely ever purchase an individual DVD, much less a full series, but I did so in this case. It's a wonderfully written, produced, and acted show that is perfect for family viewing. I highly recommend it.",1335398400,,264,4.520833333333333
5088775,5,B007I6OKQO,Best show ever but buy the Canadian versions they are better. The up version only go to season 5 and they will repeat if you mix them. Canadian versions are if you would say the original versions.,1438646400,2,196,4.324324324324325
5088776,5,B007I6OKQO,I love this series! It's a great one to watch with the whole family!,1436400000,,68,3.9285714285714284

5088778,5,B007I6OKQO,"Caught a few of these shows on late night television and just loved them. It was great to find all of these seasons in one group. Am hooked, can't wait for more.",1389312000,,161,4.0625
5088779,5,B007I6OKQO,As I said for seasons 5 an 6 this is a series the whole family can enjoy. If you like programs about horses this will not disappoint you. I love the way the family works together to help one another. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite programs. I have watched it several times and I never get tired of watching it.,1388534400,,325,4.015384615384615
5088780,5,B007I6OKQO,Very good story and something clean to watch. Shipping was good also. I'm looking forward to the next series. Shame they are not on our viewing area.,1386460800,,149,4.555555555555555
5088781,5,B007I6OKQO,Please read my rating on season 6.  This is by far the most entertaining TV series we have ever watched.  Buy all the available seasons and be prepared to get hooked and to watch them over and over again.,1385424000,,204,4.205128205128205
5088782,5,B007I6OKQO,"IF you're not hooked by now on this series, you need to start today right now order.  You won't be disappointed if you love horses, scenery and just good ole fashion values and morals.  Not many movies are kid approved these days but Heartland IS>",1384473600,,247,4.466666666666667
5088783,5,B007I6OKQO,I absolutely think this is the best series I have ever seen.  Again all deminsions of family country farm and animal life plus the issue of rehab young people involved.  There are not enough stars for me to place proper value here.,1379203200,,231,4.476190476190476
5088784,5,B007I6OKQO,I have enjoyed every dvd in this series. I is so true to life and is a wonderful example of the way family life should be. I would recommend these movies to any one and can't wait for series 6.,1374278400,,193,3.85
5088785,5,B007I6OKQO,"This is probably my favorite tv series. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she loves horses and loved this show. It's a good quality show unlike most of the ""family"" shows they have on Disney tv today.",1367884800,,218,4.475
5088786,5,B007I6OKQO,"This was a great series and I would recommend it for all those that love movies without violence and dirty language. The scenery was absolutely beautiful and the characters were great to watch grow up over the different seasons. It shows the modern day family turmoil of everyday life. Great series, everyone should watch it.",1366329600,,325,4.927272727272728
5088787,5,B007I6OKQO,this item was a gift for my son-in-law. He loves the DVDs and says they are just what he expected.,1359590400,,98,3.95
5088788,5,B007I6OKQO,"Amy and Lou lose their mother, and they live with Grandpa on Heartland Ranch.
Ty comes to work at Heartland for his probation.
Amy and Ty have feelings for each other but Grandpa keeps his eye on them.
Amy is sort of a horse whisper and Ty gives her a hand.
The series is so wonderful as they work with horses and training them with no abuse.
This is such a family series good for adults and children too.  There is no swearing in it.  Mallory is a young lady that makes her home at the Heartland Ranch while her parents are traveling and performing. There are some funny things said like it use to be. Good down to earth performances.  Scott is their vet and has a liking for Lou.
Amy and Lou's father Tim comes into the picture and there is friction between him and Grandpa. Oh my and on and on. I have the complete series 1-4 plus season 5. Also had to have ""A Heartland Christmas"". Wonderful viewing series, highly recommended.",1358294400,2,931,4.308571428571429
5088789,5,B007I6OKQO,me and my family really enjoy watching the show... 1st seen em on netflix and had to buy the dvds.... will be buying when more seasons are released,1357689600,,147,4.285714285714286
5088790,5,B007I6OKQO,My wife loves this Series and will recommend this product if you're looking for a great family Series for the family to watch together.,1357171200,,135,4.666666666666667

5088794,5,B007I6OKQO,"I love horses and enjoy watching Heartland. This item arrived on time in good condition. No complaints. I also would like to add that I have learned a lot about handling horses from watching this show. I like the positive additude Amy in the show has towards horses. I believe in trying to understand and work with horse using a positive approach  / additude over trying to force the horse against their will. To truely accomplish getting the most from any horse, one should strive to understand horses as much as posible. To become a Horse Whisper I guess is what I'm trying to say. Work togeter as a team. I will continue to watch Heartland with hopes that the show will continue on for some time.",1349481600,,699,4.503937007874016
5088795,2,B007I6OKQO,"I own EVERY Season of Heartland on DVD and every single set I have owned (bought brand new mind you) has been terrible quality. The characters look grainy and the colors are very washed out. The odd thing is that the episodes on Netflix are almost HD quality so I don't get it. It seems as though whomever is converting it to the dvds is doing a shoddy job.

My husband walked in while I was watching (he is an Engineer) and said ""Wow, that looks like a VHS"" and that is exactly what it looks like. We have two HD TVs and I have watched it on both TVs and still the same results. I think they are cutting corners and using a crappy company to do their conversions. I feel a little ripped off to be honest. Especially since I am such a loyal fan and this is one of the biggest shows in Canada so its not like they are low on budget. If you can get your episodes any other way Netflix, iTunes, etc...I would do that. I know its nice to have the box sets , but believe me when I say its not worth the $45.

Unfortunately I live in the US so I have no choice, but to buy the box sets since Netflix takes forever to post the seasons up and apparently there is a Canadian iTunes and a USA iTunes so it won't let me buy the episodes through their because they are only offered to Canadians.

If you have a choice skip the DVDS as they are terrible quality. I actually just bought Season 5 and its so grainy that I have been watching it on YouTube, thats how sad it is. I own the Dvds and I am having to resort to YouTube to watch it because the quality is so annoying. I even played one episode on Netflix on one TV and then the exact same episode from the DVD on my other TV and the difference in quality was astounding!! The Netflix version had vibrant colors and no graininess and the DVD version was very washed out (think VHS from the 90's).",1348876800,2,1839,4.032876712328767

5088797,5,B007I6OKQO,Loved watching the first 4 seasons and will purchase season 5 when it is released.  Good family show with great values.  Wish was more shows like this one made.,1347235200,,160,4.482758620689655
5088798,5,B007I6OKQO,"Living in the USA, and loving Heartland, makes for some challenges. Having seen episodes on various cable channels, usually not in order, the purchase of the entire first FOUR seasons was one of our best entertainment decisions ever. We've already watched the first three seasons, the video quality is fantastic, and are spreading the Heartland series joy with family! We can't wait for season five to come out on DVD later this month...",1346976000,,437,5.0
5088799,5,B007I6OKQO,"This is the BEST TV series I have watched in a very long time.  Very family oriented - the family even sits down for dinner together every night.

8517350,5,B007I6OKQO,"My grandmother's favorite show.  I didn't realize it was the Canadian edition until it came, I might have totally missed something in the description about it.  It's not a huge deal and it apparently saved us a lot of money compared to the normal US version.  I think the only big difference is packaging (the one I got is in French & English) and then the menu offers you to choose to watch the DVDs in both languages as well.  No big deal and so worth it for the price!  Basically got 4 seasons that would have cost a little more than what they wanted for the US season one disk.",1520899200,,581,4.198198198198198

I already opened a couple of these, but they came in great condition. I was also checking to see if the 4th Season included the Christmas movie, but it seems you have to buy that separately. So after you buy these, don't forget to look for A Heartland Christmas and buy it from Amazon!",1511136000,,469,4.465116279069767
