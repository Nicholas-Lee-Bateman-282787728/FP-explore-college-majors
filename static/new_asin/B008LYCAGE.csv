What's worse is that when doing research for this film, the filmmaker tried to do a Indiegogo campaign to pay for color correction and sound work but failed to raise the funds. So, instead of waiting to get the funds or taking more low-teir steps to fix it, he released the film as is. That's such a shame, because this could've worked.

There are two strikes against the film that makes me unable to recommend paying money for it.

#1: The lighting is terrible and constantly changes from shot-to-shot. When you're a no-budget to extremely low-budget it's to be expected in certain scenarios (like outdoor shots) but when it happens in INDOOR shots where you can control the lighting, there's just no excuse. It takes you out of the film. I don't know if color correction would've helped at all, but the way it is now is terrible.

#2: The sound design is non-existent. Audio hiss gets so bad you can't hear what is being said... and now imagine that a film score is put OVER that. What little you could hear is now drowned out!

And that's especially a shame, because the story (that I did have the pleasure of reading beforehand) is a good read and could've made a good film. As such, you can't appreciate the acting or anything else because you can't follow the story.

Finally, the film is long at around 2 hrs and 30 minutes. If it shed 30 minutes or more to make a leaner and tighter film, I think it would benefit greatly as it does drag in the middle.

I bought this because the trailer didn't seem to show any of these problems and, like I said, I enjoyed the original story. But I can't recommend it. It gets two stars because I don't think it fails in every aspect to get a 1 (or lower) but it didn't deserve anything higher than a two.",1367625600,,1881,4.406340057636887
