8693985,5,B00R3UHSCS,"I first discovered Ilyse's Dancinerate workouts through onDemand and LOVED those workouts. I decided to purchase this DVD and wasn't disappointed, I'm not a dancer, but her instruction is very good and easy to follow. I have lost weight and gained confidence!",1475193600,,259,5.190476190476191
8693986,3,B00R3UHSCS,"This video gets only 3 stars because during both routines Ilyse does all the moves to one side. Every other dance video I have done repeats the moves to both sides. I was unevenly sore for days.
That being said, I like her energy and she sure as heck got me sweating.
I would consider seeing if her other videos have more balanced routines.",1424822400,3,340,4.328125
