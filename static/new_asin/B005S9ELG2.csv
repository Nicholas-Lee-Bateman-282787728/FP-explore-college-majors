In a recent National Catholic Register interview, he was asked about his ""reversion to the Catholic faith.""  As per Sheen: ""It began after my illness in the Philippines while filming Apocalypse Now. I began going to church because I was afraid of dying. Then I stopped going for a long time. My eyes were first reopened when I was in India filming Gandhi. Then, in 1981, while in Paris, I read the book The Brothers Karamazov....After reading it, I went to see a priest and told him I wanted to come home....I came back to a Church that was very different. I left a Church of fear and returned to a Church of love"" (Tim Drake, 9/14/11).  Sheen seems be suffering from the misunderstanding that sees a dichotomy between the Church before Vatican II and after Vatican II!

4862462,4,B005S9ELG2,"While I don't recall a mention of blisters, bed bugs or weather, which are hot topics of conversation along The Way, this was a movie I enjoyed. It showed some of the lovely areas--and avoided those where you walk next to a highway.

It's not as easy as they made it look, but I've always appreciated Martin Sheen's acting and wasn't disappointed. The ending is classic and so rewarding!

For those of you who are now going to walk it, check out some of the Camino Web sites for advice and encouragement. Buen Camino!",1320710400,33,517,4.48936170212766
4862463,5,B005S9ELG2,"My wife and I saw this film. It had an unexpected influence on both of us.  My Mom died at the end of September and while we always know they will go, it was difficult for me -- and I am 63.  I think it is worse when the second one goes. So, we saw the film and I did a couple of things that I rarely do. First, I downloaded the music (remember I am 63 and don't do things like that usually). Then I bought a book about the Camino. Finally, we leave this late Spring for the trip.",1320624000,101,480,3.742574257425743

4862465,5,B005S9ELG2,"I had no real idea of what the movie was about aside from something about a pilgrimage, but I felt like giving it a chance.  I heard from some reviewers that it was good.
So I was unprepared for the emotional impact the film had from the beginning. The screenplay was wonderfully written, the characters were all flawed as each of us are.  I don't want to provide too much details, because too much is described already.
I will say that the journey was an emotional one as well as a scenic splendor.  As the viewer gets to accompany these pilgrims from diverse walks of life, you see their flaws and qualities up close.
The visual beauty of The Way cannot be overlooked.  The innkeepers and fellow pilgrims all looked like regular human beings from everywhere.  The music that accompanied the film was well chosen.
A deeply touching film.",1319760000,182,838,4.597315436241611
4862466,5,B005S9ELG2,"My eyes were wet and I laughed out loud in the first fifteen minutes of ""The Way,"" and I continued laughing and crying throughout. I left the theater feeling the generous glow that a good movie inspires. I'll now be telling everyone I know to see this film, on a big screen, and I'm already looking forward to seeing it again.

I was a bit anxious about ""The Way."" I anticipated so many ways a movie that features backpacking, pilgrimages, and religion could go wrong. Would it be excessively pious and maudlin? New Age-y and Christophobic? Simply a bad movie? There is a reason so many films focus on graphic, intimate scenes and explosions: those are easy to shoot and they arouse viewer interest. ""The Way"" rapidly calmed my anxiety. It's a honey of a movie.

Tom (Martin Sheen) is a sixty-something ophthalmologist. His son Dan (Emilio Estevez) dies in an accident. Tom travels to France to retrieve his son's body. Learning of his son's attempt to walk the camino, Tom decides to cremate his son's remains and carry them as he fulfills his son's plan.

Tom walks through picturesque, mountainous countryside and through the plazas of old towns. As happens when one is traveling, Tom encounters an assortment of eclectic characters. Joost (Yorick van Wageningen) is a corpulent, talkative, pot smoking Dutchman who is walking the trail to lose weight. Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) is a sharp tongued, very angry Canadian blonde. Jack (James Nesbitt) is an Irish travel writer with the gift of gab - he didn't just kiss the Blarney Stone, he went steady with it. There is a priest with a brain tumor who distributes rosaries, and pilgrims debating the roles of the French, the Spanish and the Basque in ancient battles against invading Moors. Waiters take very strong stands on tapas. Gypsies defend their honor.

The pilgrims sleep in spare hostel dormitories with snoring, coughing, shooshing roommates. They visit churches and enact rituals.

There was a moment in this movie in which I, a traveler and backpacker, was one hundred percent engaged. In superhero movies, I don't really care if the superhero gets the dilithium crystals to the giant spider. In this movie, a backpacker drops his pack into a rushing river that rapidly sweeps it toward the sea. THAT scene commanded my full engagement. The backpacker's pack contains his entire world, his heart, his safety, his entertainment, his identity, his survival. I was on the edge of my seat.

What happens in the movie is what happens when you travel, and when you pray. The demands of travel bring forth bonding rituals - I'll listen to your rant; you'll bail me out of jail - that create intimacy with unexpected, and all too temporary, companions. There are sudden and heart-wrenching confessions that make two strangers more intimate than family members. There are little triumphs that make it all worthwhile - finding orange trees laden with fruit after a night of sleeping on cold ground, one night in a five-star hotel after punishing weeks of self-denial.

Martin Sheen is so convincing as Tom I really lost the sense of watching a movie. Tom is a man of few words or gestures, and Sheen's every subdued facial expression carries weight and feeling. I had the sense of those who interacted with Tom that I would appreciate a mere word from him more than a paragraph from someone less grounded and sincere.

I really disliked Joost at first, and, come to think of it, many of the other characters, as well, but the film, without any visible effort, brought me to appreciate them the way you can come to appreciate someone you've shared the road with. When Joost is asked why he is walking the trail and he finally tells why, it is a very poignant, precious moment, so utterly believable it could have been in a well-made documentary. Van Wageningen will receive many love letters from women who cannot separate him from Joost, a fictional character so believable he makes you want to hug him. James Nesbitt could be extemporizing his lines, they feel so lived-in. Deborah Kara Unger gives new life to an ancient prayer.

I wish the movie had done a couple of things it did not. I just did not believe that Tom could immediately begin walking the camino in anything but a halting fashion. Many non-hiker friends have called me the day after a hike with me to tell me that their feet are so covered with blisters they can't put on shoes, and their muscles are so sore they can't move (the big babies.) I would have liked to have seen Tom breaking his body in to the demands of the trail. I also would have liked to have seen even just a brief scene where he purchased footwear. Very few ophthalmologists cross the Atlantic with the proper footwear for a walk hundreds of kilometers long, and footwear is a big deal for a walker. I would like to have seen the walkers interact with their packs, something that all hikers do - a tightening of the belt strap here, a loosening of the shoulder strap there. They become a part of your body.

I wish the direction and cinematography had done something more with the countryside and the historic plazas and churches, which are always shown in a way that is pretty, but not innovative. I wish we learned a bit about the keepers of the refugios, the hostels where pilgrims spend the night. To the pilgrims, the towns change every day. To the towns, the pilgrims change every day. How do these dovetailing experiences illuminate each other? And I wish more had been said about religion, although what little is said is intriguing and implies worlds of meaning. I wish more had been said about the alleged sacredness of some places.

These are minor complaints. This film is destined to become a much beloved classic. See it.",1319414400,303,5729,4.7304609218436875
4862467,5,B005S9ELG2,"The development of the characters in this movie is superb. The prior review is so well-written, all I want to add is another review with five stars!",1318550400,20,148,4.518518518518518
4862468,5,B005S9ELG2,"Crossing the Pyrenees and Basque country, then winding their way across northern Spain to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, pilgrims have walked the 800 km Camino de Santiago for over a thousand years. The reasons for undertaking such a journey are as varied as the pilgrims themselves. Most of them are seeking something that has little or nothing to do with religion, yet taps into a deep, nameless yearning for connection to the mystery.

In ""The Way,"" four of these pilgrims find themselves thrown together by chance. As their stories unfold we meet Tom, played by Martin Sheen, completing the journey begun by his estranged son who died in a sudden mountain storm shortly after setting off. He is joined by: a jovial bear of a Dutchman, hoping to regain his wife's affection; an acerbic Canadian woman, trying to exorcise the anger built up in an abusive marriage; and an Irish author who masks his writer's block by talking nonstop.

The acting is superb, though some of the characters may have been a bit overdrawn at the beginning. Writer-Director Emilio Estevez, who is Martin Sheen's son and plays his son in the movie, deftly interweaves the development of the personal stories of the four main characters with the hardships and camaraderie of the Pilgrim's Way.  He takes us through lush countryside and rocky hills, stopping in local inns, gathering with other pilgrims in the evening around meals, and then retiring to Spartan dormitories to start off again in the morning.

Gradually the experience of the Camino works its way into the spirits of the pilgrims. They become mirrors for each other, helping to strip away the protective layers that have preserved their pain and isolation, and with their new vulnerability, freeing them to feel and connect once more. In the end, the message of this poignant film is that opening our hearts to others is the real miracle. Connecting with them through kindness and laughter and joy is the magic that invites the presence of God.

A lovely, moving film.",1317945600,575,2030,4.8895348837209305

There are no guns, sex, profanity, or high speed action. Go watch the Fast and the Furious (Love those!) This movie is for provoking thought.

The Way is a beautiful story about a father and son and a journey, started by the son and finished by the father. It is not a documentary on the Camino de Santiago and is not intended to be. I definitely recommend watching the movie and if you, like I was, are inspired, then look into some documentaries, books, maps, guide books, etc and get walking on your own journey.",1520380800,,561,4.063063063063063

4862703,1,B005S9ELG2,"""What a tragic piece of rubbish"".

Story line: A self-centered optometrist from California, walks across Spain, in efforts to repent his guilt for being such a rotten parent. Show starts slow, evolves uneventful and ends overlooking an ocean view.
Highlights include; dirt trails, farming fields and casual greeting dialog as he passes others on his walk. Just when I though ""Watching Paint Dry"" was dull and without script, here comes ""The Way"" for a new all time low. If this is the best Martin Sheens (real) son Emilio Estevez can write, get a real life and stop sponging off your dads reputation.

Acting was shallow and dry, script was lethargic and theme was as tasteless as water. Watched once, and threw it in the trash. How anyone can find this movie entertaining, meaningful or even remotely inspirational , is either asleep, or lives in the crawl space under their home. ""Terrible"", would be a compliment.

Typically I don't write a movie review unless the show is exceptionally good: ""The Bucket List"", or exceptionally bad: ""The Way"", to warn people.
How this movie received so many Amazon positive reviews, leads me to question how many are fake and written by a Sheen family member. (i.e.) Very small percentage of 'Verified Purchasers'.

Not so say the flamenco extravaganza in Galicia. There is no flamenco as shown in the movie in Galicia, the whole flamenco party was a cheap stereotype taken completely out of contest. It seems like just because the movie was in Spain, they needed so throw in some ""typical Spanish"".

4862853,4,B005S9ELG2,"The story begins with the main character Dr. Tomas Avery (Martin Sheen) learning his free-spirited son, Daniel (Emilio Estevez), has died during a storm while walking El Camino in the Pyrenees, France. He goes there to collect the remains and decides to walk El Camino for his son.

Along the way, he meets fellow hikers portrayed by Deborah Kara Unger (Canadian actor playing Sarah from Canada), Yorick Van Wageningen (Netherlands actor playing Joost from Amsterdam) and James Nesbitt (Irish actor playing Jack from Ireland).

As a Canadian, I was pleasantly surprised to see our country represented but disappointed the stereotype eh was the way she was introduced. Jack from Ireland was a writer with writers block who was determined to break it on El Camino.

The premise for The Way is fairly basic: People who want something more out of life than what society has dictated for them set out to find themselves or perhaps a little piece of adventure to hold onto when they return to normal life. Along the way, they may not find what they set out to, but they discover something wonderful about themselves.

This movie may not appeal to people under the age of 25. The target audience is between 40 and 60, and I land right in the middle of that. Its for people who are looking for something more meaningful than what is found in the average movie. There are no sex scenes, cursing, violence or heavy drama.

The story is for people who desire substance in their lives and who are tired of the everyday rhetoric, the burden of technology and the clutter of stuff that fills our homes and our lives. Its for people who want to feel the freedom of life again, as if they were kids running through the woods seeking adventure at every turn, yet think deeply about how it is all connected and what living truly means.

The romance of finding camaraderie while enduring a long journey will appeal to those who have experienced that in their lifetime. They will know that feeling of tackling a challenge with others can connect them to those people in ways nothing else can. I have felt that connection and yearn for it again after watching the movie.

The Way reminds us that we are all on a journey, and the experiences and the people we meet along the way is what brings true joy to living. Estevezs character said it best, You don't choose a life; you live it.

The life we choose for ourselves might not be the life we were meant to lead. If it doesnt bring true satisfaction, true joy, then it was meant for someone else. Every day, we have the power to change our lives, make decisions that will put us on the right path.

The movie doesnt stateor at least I didn't catch ithow Daniel could travel the world as he did. Maybe it doesnt matter. But for the rest of us, we cant pick up and leave for a couple months on a regular basis. Or can we? Maybe I just don't know the way.",1500163200,,2881,4.503831417624521
4862854,5,B005S9ELG2,"First - be sure to recognize that this is a movie for the sake of entertainment and not a documentary on the Camino.  Understanding that makes this a wonderful film.  Does it show everything along the Camino Frances? No.  Does it gloss over the difficulties of a month+ trek across a country carrying everything you need and want on your back?  Of course it does.  Does it sequence some of the location out of order?  It absolutely does.  If that is going to totally distract you from the actual point of the film, then I suppose you should look elsewhere fore your entertainment.  But if not look at what The Way brings to you.

Does it tell a heart warming story of struggle and redemption? Yes.  Does it allow the exploration of how family dynamics work when the family dynamic is dysfunctional until tragedy strikes?  Yes.  Does it develop each of the characters from what they admit their concerns are to what their souls really need? Yes it does.  Is it set in along a gorgeous route in Northern Spain that will inspire you to pack your bags and see for yourself (whether walking as a pilgrim or touring as a tourist)?  Most definitely.

So get the film, pop some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy the show.",1499558400,6,1211,4.490825688073395
4862855,5,B005S9ELG2,"I only became aware of the movie by stumbling on an interview of Martin Sheen on the public radio show ""On Being"" which covers spiritual topics. I loved the interview, with Martin Sheen offering much on an authentic Christianity of the disadvantaged, as well as how his actual walking of about half the 800km pilgrimage route moved him - no glib Hollywood fakery there.
With this preparation, I couldn't help watch the movie less as fiction than as personal reflection by Sheen and his son, Emilio Estevez, who directed. Years ago Martin Sheen did in fact experience a crisis which culminated in his getting sober and reembracing the religion of his youth, which process this pilgrimage continued.

It does a great job of sharing the human condition and showing how walking The Way is a spiritual journey that transcends religions and cultures.

4862920,3,B005S9ELG2,"Released in 2010, The Way stars Martin Sheen as a grieving father who decides to hike Camino de Santiago (aka the Way of St. James), a popular 500-mile trail in northern Spain. There he teams-up with three other solo hikers (Yorick van Wageningen, Deborah Kara Unger & James Nesbitt). Can he work through his grim grief and find inspiration?

The movie was produced, directed and written by Estevez based on the book by Jack Hitt. He even plays the stars son in a relatively small role. While theres a lot of good in this movie, like the excellent locations, cast, music, cinematography and message, its palpably flawed by some weak writing and the corresponding unconvincing social situations. Several scenes needed the kinks worked out, but Im not blaming the actors. Im sure they did the best they could with the script they had.

A top example of what Im talking about is when our curmudgeonly protagonist has some kind of drunken meltdown, awkwardly blowing up at his new friends. Sequences like this needed further work, but Im guessing that Estevez didn't have the funds because fixing & reshooting scenes costs money (the proverbial time is money). So, as an unseasoned director, he shot them and said Thats good enough, thinking he could make the movie work in the editing room. It didnt. But theres still some worthwhile material here.

Check out 2015s A Walk in the Woods with Robert Redford & Nick Nolte for an excellent take on similar terrain.

The movie runs 121 minutes and was shot on the actual trail in Spain.

4862922,5,B005S9ELG2,"I love this movie. I've been an Emilio Estevez fan since the 80s and have enjoyed the movies that he has written and directed. The Way, starring his father, Martin Sheen, is an inspiring film. I had never heard of the Camino de Santiago until I saw this movie. It inspired me to want to walk it. I've prayed about hiking it, and it will finally come true. My sister and I are walking the Portuguese Camino this summer. This is an aspiring movie that identifies the many reasons why people choose to make this journey. Like our journey in life, it is a physical journey outwards and a spiritual journey within that helps people discover more about themselves and the things that matter. It's a great film with some wonderful performances by Martin Sheen, Deborah Kara Unger, James Nesbitt, and Yorick van Wageningen.",1491696000,,815,4.666666666666667

The story is of a man whose son was hiking in France and was killed by a weather system that moved in to the area.

4862945,5,B005S9ELG2,"A former coworker rattled off to me a list of movies he found to be enjoyable, that I might also enjoy. ""The Way"" was one of the movies in his list.

As an apostate Catholic and unabashed atheist, I wondered whether I would get anything out a movie, where the primary protagonist, Tom Avery, decides to honor his deceased son Daniel, by walking the El Camino de Santiago, a thousand-year old religious pilgrimage route. Nevertheless, I put aside my reservations and watched the film.

""The Way"" quickly drew me into its story. I shared Tom's grief upon learning Daniel had died in a storm, just one day after starting to walk the El Camino, and then felt Tom's resolute determination to complete the five-hundred-mile walk on behalf of Daniel. As the story unfolded, I realized Tom's pilgrimage was a symbolic effort to give meaning and closure to his son's death.

""The Way"" gave me a roller coaster of emotions: laughter, sorrow, tears, frustration, and finally happiness and joy. I felt for Tom and the other characters in the film, and cared about what happened to them. What more could one ask of a movie?",1489449600,12,1110,4.711340206185567

4862986,5,B005S9ELG2,Really great story and well done. I didn't like the score too much - it seemed out of sync with the film at times. The Catholic Church also changed its policies about scattering ashes so it's no longer accurate but still worth it.,1486771200,,230,4.372093023255814

Considering Mr. Sheen's son wrote, directed, and produced the film--and put is father in the key role--it, at least for me, took on a bit deeper meaning than it might have otherwise.

We have been back to Spain in 2015 and 2016 on other Camino's and will walk the Portuguese route in April 2016. It has been a life style change for us. I can't recall any movie I have ever watched for me that called out to me like this one did.
For those considering a Camino journey in Spain, just do it. It will be challenging but will be the best life experience you will ever have.

4863362,5,B005S9ELG2,"An Episcopal priest, that is a friend of mine, spent the summer with his wife and daughter on a pilgrimage walking the El Camino de Santiago.  When he returned, I wanted to know what inspired him to walk over 400 miles and he responded, ""The movie, The Way!"".  Out of curiosity, I purchased the movie to learn what was so inspiring; not knowing what to expect.  It is a slow moving, simple, film but moving and thought-provoking.  It is the type of movie that encourages one to reflect on their own life and prompt discussions several days after viewing.  If you are looking for excitement, this is not the movie for you.  However, if you are looking for substance along with some beautiful scenery, I highly recommend it!",1474934400,,722,4.6015625

Martin Sheen perfectly portrays the part in my opinion. The complexity of the relationship between he and his son, yet not letting the sadness get in the way of the journey he's decided to take.

Written (for the screen, I assume) and directed by Emilio Estevez, and starring his father, Martin Sheen; it is an inspirational story with great characters and beautiful vistas.  No spoilers here.  Afraid Netflix would  eventually remove this from their selection (after first finding it free on Amazon Prime), I ordered a copy for many, many more viewings.

When I got home I looked up the movie on Amazon. It showed CC on the back so I took it for granted that my husband would be able to watch and hear it this time. We sat down to watch it and could not find the CC, except in Spanish. We were so disappointed. My husband says he hears alot better when he has CC.
So I now have a Dvd that he cannot watch. We had so looked forward to seeing it together. I just wished my husband could have enjoyed it as much as I did. The movie really moved me. It was one of my favorites. That's how good it was. I would rate it a 10+ if it were not for the fact that it did not have English CC.",1469145600,,839,3.7191011235955056

4864169,5,B005S9ELG2,"I usually don't watch ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" but made it a point to watch an episode a few years ago whose preview mentioned that actor/director Emilio Estevez and his father, actor Martin Sheen, would be discussing Estevez's new movie ""The Way"".

Beginning, Spoiler Alert***************

You may already know the basic plot of ""The Way"": Dr. Thomas Avery (Martin Sheen) must travel to Spain to retrieve the body of his son Daniel (Emilio Estevez) who was accidentally killed while walking The Way of St. James (Camino de Santiago). As it can be in the real world, father and son didn't see eye to eye on things. While in Spain, Thomas decides to make the 800 km foot pilgrimage.

The penitential aspect of the pilgrimage comes out in a humorous way at first, as Thomas arrives too late at ""La Posada"" for dinner and then can hardly sleep in the gym-like room he is in that night as the other pilgrims snore, cough, and crunch food. Later, his backpack drops from a bridge into a flowing body of water below. He successfully retrieves the backpack. Later, the backpack is stolen from Thomas by a boy-thief. But later the father of the boy-thief makes his son carry Avery's backpack to the edge of town as a penance, before Avery takes it and moves on.

Along the Way, Dr. Avery comes into contact with a Catholic priest, Fr. Frank, who he first mistakes for a rabbi because of the yamaka Father wears to cover up a scar from brain cancer surgery. Father Frank offers Thomas a Rosary, which he accepts.

Abortion comes up in ""The Way"" as  pilgrim Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) mentions a daughter she aborted, conceived with her abusive ex-husband. She says, ""Sometimes I hear her voice, my baby ... And sometimes I hear her talk"".

End, Spoiler Alert ***************

""The Way"" is an enjoyable film pilgrimage. It features quite an eclectic group of characters who make for many interesting scenes. It reminds one that everyone has hidden sorrows. Everyone carries a cross. But it also reminds one that God's Grace is sufficient and that mysteriously He makes all things work together for the good of those who love Him:

""We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."" -Romans 8:28

""[B]ut he (Jesus) said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.'"" - 2 Cor 12:9

""The Cross will not crush you; if its weight makes you stagger, its power will sustain you."" -St. Padre Pio (1887-1968)",1460851200,,2479,4.675862068965517

As a companion, I also recommend Sonia Choquette's book, ""Walking Home: A Pilgrimage from Humbled to Healed"".  The movie is one man's journey of self-discovery, from unutterable grief to lively authenticity.  The book is one woman's journey that describes in poignant detail the day to day grit and struggle to move physically across the El Camino and still remaining open to the mental and spiritual challenges and upliftments that are an unerring result.  Both the movie and the book are easy to relate to, easy to follow.

4864216,5,B005S9ELG2,"A Profoundly Religious Film

I'm a late comer to The Way, stumbling across it some months ago and it is a film I love. I'm sorry Hollywood didn't pick it up and distribute it but Hollywood is now catering to young men with violence and sex as their bait. A great pity. I found this film to be quietly and profoundly religious, a film about atonement and redemption, subjects now ridiculed in our present antiChristian and raunch culture.

The film's early golfing scene sets up the religious theme so subtly it can be missed.

On the Camino, all four tell porkies/porky pies/lies about their reasons for doing the Camino Frances.

Tom, estranged from the church, says he's walking the Camino for his son, Daniel, to finish the journey he started. Joost, the pot smoking, party seeking Dutchman, claims he's doing it to lose weight, to be more attractive to his wife, to fit into his suit for his brother's third wedding. The angry, bitter woman says she is doing it to give up smoking. The writer, with verbal diahorea, says his reason is writer's block.

Along the way, Tom ""sees"" his son, the woman ""hears"" her aborted daughter's voice.

At the pilgrim's office, after 500 miles of walking, only the woman admits her reason for doing the walk is religious. Joost sticks to his losing weight, wife won't sleep with him routine. The writer claims he wanted to find leprechauns.  Tom says he needed to travel more.

In the Santiago de Compostela, however, Joost falls to his knees and makes his way, to place his hand where millions have placed theirs before him, before the statue of St James. Tom, with Daniel's ashes, reveres the bones of St James. The woman adores the Holy Family, the opposite of her brutal marital experience. The writer, entering the church, a ""Temple of Tears"", finally adheres to the Old Testament advice, ""Be still and know that I am God"" and breaks down in tears.

At Muxio, too, the characters show their true selves.

There are flaws in the editing: the specks on Tom's jacket, the American guide book being wrong, equipment changes, and you can look for more.

Yes, there is a little and tight knit community formed along the way, but ultimately the film is about very personal journeys to atonement, forgiveness and peace.  And, please google this poem: Lord, Give Me a Blister.",1459468800,,2309,4.7164179104477615

Sheen and Yorick van Wageningen (as Joost from Amsterdam) really shine in their roles, with wonderful performances by Deborah Kara Unger (as Sarah, with her painful history) and James Nesbitt (as Jack, a writer with ""writer's block"").

So, instead of finishing his doctorate, Daniel travels and unfortunately gets caught in a storm in the Pyrenees. (Again, the cast of characters highlights anthropology/sociology: Captain Henri (Tcheky Karyo), Angelica (Angela Molina), El Ramon (Eusebio Lazaro), are among my favorites, running the gamut of human emotions and circumstances.)

*** SPOILER ALERT -- DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ***

Tom goes to Spain's Basque Country to retrieve the body of his only son. He decides to walk The Camino de Santiago from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela, and then further to Muxia, scattering Daniel's ashes along the way.

The spirit of Daniel is very much with Tom along the way. Tom also makes the acquaintance of three other trekkers, or peregrinos, who form close friendships after some early conflicts, underscoring one of my favorite quotes: ""To understand all is to forgive all.""

Toward the end, the film pays homage to Santiago de Compostela: exterior scenes from the distance and close up, St. James at the entrance, inside the church, and a mass with clergy getting the huge incense burner (botafumeiro) airborne, swinging from the nave to the chancel (an awesome scene!) on its enormous arc.

At the suggestion of Ishmael, a gypsy with integrity, Tom goes the extra mile, taking Daniel's remaining ashes to Muxia, to the sea, where Tom reaches catharsis.

Scenes of the Spanish countryside highlight the beauty of this route: a field under the Milky Way. A corridor where miracles can happen.

Since all four travelers are seeking something along the way that they hope to find resolved by their destination, I could not stop myself from remembering ""The Wizard of Oz."" In spite of heartfelt sentiments in both films, I think ""The Way"" is the more serious of the two.",1459209600,,2524,5.0359712230215825

Some say I read too much into a movie but I simply enjoy critiquing lighting, camera lens, angle of the shots, dialog delivery and script, that's not asking a lot. This movie , to me, delivered 5 stars in all those areas!
I'm shocked it only did well in the Toronto Film Fest and nowhere else?????
This is not a movie for children nor those that have attention deficit. It can seem slow at points but when following a small group of Hikers it assumes the proper pace.

This Movie has touched me deeply in so many emotional ways.  I felt such connection with all of the characters taking this pilgrimage together.

I was laughing and crying throughout the entire film. I enjoyed every minute of it, and by the end of the film I felt that these past two hours of my life were not wasted.

4865229,5,B005S9ELG2,"I loved this movie for several reasons.  It shows how short life is (though we all should know this by now)...how anything can happen to anyone at anytime...not just to other people.  It also showed how people grieve differently.  Another aspect of this movie that I found very interesting (besides the fact that these people could take off a couple months of work to take this journey!) is how these people from different backgrounds, ages, beliefs, etc. started off as complete strangers yet came and stayed together.  Finally, the ending showed the real reasons (for most of the characters anyway) why they took this journey.  It was very thought-provoking.

4865286,4,B005S9ELG2,"Good movie. Highly recommend watching. The plot line kept me focused, though at times I thought it dragged a little.  I will look into more about the pilgrimage now. One thing, though, I was disappointed at different points in the movie and then especially at the end when he would leave some of his son's ashes at different points on the pilgrimage and then what he does with the ashes at the very end. This was apparently about a pilgrimage to St. James tomb and you could see the Catholic faith influences in the movie, so a proper burial of his son's ashes would have been more respectful of the human person's body and in line with Catholic teaching. Cremation is allowed but still a Mass and a burial of the ashes are proper teaching.",1448841600,2,740,4.481481481481482
4865287,4,B005S9ELG2,"I've done the Camino, and I must say that this film gives the viewer a good approximation of what it's like to hike from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in France to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Anyone who has actually done the Camino will note some discrepancies. For example, after the protagonist has been hiking several days, he is shown sitting at a table in front of a hostel, supposedly in Spain. He would have actually passed that hostel, called Orisson, in France a few hours after starting out from Saint-Jean. Also, the pilgrims walk right into the cathedral at Santiago alone. In reality they would have to stand in line for hours with thousands of others before they could enter with the throng. But, the film is fiction and not fact, so I don't want to be too picky. However, I am giving it four instead of five stars, because I think with a little more effort it could have been made more realistic.

I don't want to discourage anyone from watching the film. It is enjoyable, and it has inspired thousands to walk the Camino and experience it for themselves. Anyone who watches this film will presented with an idealized version of the pilgrimage to Santiago minus the blisters, tendonitis, etc. I recommend watching the film, and if you then think you would like to do the Camino yourself, I suggest downloading the eBook ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Senior-Citizen-Walks-the-Camino-de-Santiago/dp/B0186HRI3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Senior Citizen Walks the Camino de Santiago</a>"" to get a realistic and detailed day-by-day description of what it is like to do the Camino including 260 photographs of things you will see on your walk.",1448755200,,1696,5.235294117647059

4865996,2,B005S9ELG2,"Emilio Estevez wrote and directed this film about an affluent father and his son who don't understand each other, yet have something in common.  They're each experiencing a crisis of faith.

The son believes his father lacks what he is searching for:  ""You don't choose your life, Dad, you live one"".

The father thinks the son is wasting his life, taking advantage of him and lacking ambition.

In an attempt to find his way in life, the son goes on a pilgrimage paid for by his father, but without his blessing.  Following a turn of events, the father begins a journey of his own.

The father's attempt to reconcile differences with his son becomes the beginning of the road back to the faith he lost.

The movie makes it's points subtly.  It has the makings of a story that can move an audience and it has an impact, but it lacks the characteristics of a life changer.  Reflecting on the finer points reveals the brilliance of Estevez.

4866248,4,B005S9ELG2,"I've seen this movie twice. The first time I watched it, it was the inspiration for me to go walk the Camino de Santiago myself. I walked ""The Way"" for myself in April of 2015. After walking 500+ miles from St. Jean Pied du Port to Santiago de Compostella, and on to Finterre and Muxia, I returned home and watched the film a second time to re-live my incredible experience. Overall, it's a nice feel good film with a good story line, good acting, and fantastic scenery. The drug references weren't necessary, but Hollywood does need something besides the beautiful scenery. The film is not a riveting action flick, It's not a ""B"" movie either. I'd say it's a solid 3-star pic, but I gave it four stars because it does help me remember my Camino. Walking the Camino, now that I'd give 5 stars... as a matter of fact, I'm going back to walk it again next year.",1445904000,,859,4.408805031446541

Love the stories of each pilgrim, the subtle and human way they begin to find the thread of humanity, of the Spirit in one another. Sheen is touching in his portrayal of a father finding his son and himself. Estevez does a masterful job. All the actors are great, as us the story and the stories which make the story. The Camino is gorgeous in its beauty, rugged and open, mountains to the sea. If you want to feel connected and especially if you don't, watch this.",1445472000,,513,4.526881720430108

4866417,3,B005S9ELG2,"I watched 'The Way' right after having walked the Portuguese road to Santiago de Compostela from Porto. It was a beautiful trip and I felt emotional about it, so I wanted to reminisce and get another perspective. The film takes place in the more traditional road to Santiago, which goes across the north of Spain (also known as the French road, because it begins in the border with France), but I could still relate.

The production feels appropriately low budget, considering that the pilgrimage is traditionally meant to be an inexpensive experience. More important than the cost, however, is whether the film has soul. And I have to say, I was very moved by the basic storyline: an older man decides to walk to Santiago in order to feel closer to his adventurous, freewheeling son, who died while doing the pilgrimage. Both Martin and Emilio Estevez (real-life father and son) achieve good performances. Dutch actor Yorick van Wageningen also conveys emotion and adds some comic relief. Even before I read that the project was inspired by Martin and his grandson's (producer Taylor Estevez's) trip to Santiago, I could tell that there was a strong personal element and that is what I liked best about 'The Way'.

On the other hand, many parts of the film feel forced. One example is the scene in which James Nesbitt's Irish character, Jack, is introduced. He tries too hard to be quirky and this feels disconnected from the Camino experience. The pilgrimage is all about getting in touch with your true self, so any sign of phoniness feels especially out of place. There are other wacky, eccentric characters that are unbelievable or badly rendered, which distract from the more genuine portions. There is also a part in which a gypsy gives a speech about how it is wrong to stereotype his people as thieves, when in reality so many of them are very proud and dignified. I understand that director Emilio Estevez means well and wants to defend the gypsy ethnic group, but the message lacks subtlety and feels too didactic.

I can't quite say that I loved 'The Way', but it certainly has its merits. If you're interested in the pilgrimage, I recommend that you wait and watch it only after you have finished your trip to Santiago, so that you can compare it with your own personal memories.",1445299200,,2292,4.782828282828283

As mentioned in the movie, the walk will be for yourself, however the initial phase may be motivated by an event that did not involve you.  Tom's (Martin Sheen)  journey was as such.  Motivated by the death of a love one, he takes the 800 kilometer walk to the rest place of the apostle James, and his experience is real.  Great movie",1444176000,,435,4.5256410256410255

4866754,4,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is about a father (Martin Sheen) who loses his son in France (played by Emilio Estevez, who is a PERFECT role for the son because I've always felt the two of them sort of resemble each other) so Martin decides, rather abruptly without warning, that he wants to take a trip across the Pyrenees (a mountain range between Spain and France) in honor of his son's memory even though he's told that given his age he shouldn't risk it.  The story gets going rather quickly.

Along the way Martin meets a few memorable characters who he initially doesn't have any time for because he's still upset and bitter over his sons passing so he prefers to be left alone, but gradually warms up to.  These characters include Deborah Kara Unger (the female of the bunch who's a sarcastic and witty Canadian with her own abusive history to share- she's the last to know the reason for Martin's journey across the mountains), Yorick Van Wageningen (a boisterous young Dutchman with tons of likeable personality that Martin has mixed feelings with due to his sons passing still being a mental issue, and due to the two of them always bumping into each other along the way) and James Nesbitt (an informative and very talkative Irish book writer who can rub Martin the wrong way sometimes, but has well-meaning attributes).

From time to time, as Martin and the gang explore the vast mountains, curvy paths, open fields, historic towns, statues and history of the locations on their journey to Spain, Martin sprinkles some of his sons ashes on important landmarks.  It's strange he tells Yorick the reason he's doing this, but not Deborah.  While there is a sad overtone to the movie (especially whenever Emilio suddenly appears, which is supposed to indicate that his presence is being felt by his father) this movie isn't quite as sad as I thought it'd be.  The story's really good though it does drag occasionally.  Perhaps 20 minutes could have been knocked away without any harm.  The most memorable segments are the ones where Martin loses his backpack while carelessly bending down standing on a bridge so it falls in the water below resulting in Martin having to go down and grab it before the water carries it away, and when the group arrives to a gypsy town and a teenage boy steals his backpack.

The characters are mostly memorable too.  There's more characters that come along during the walk, and they're interesting enough to leave an impression (especially the wise father of the teenage boy I mention above).  It's interesting to see if Martin will ever warm up the group he's with, who are determined to stick together even though they don't really get along which is somewhat amusing because in reality if someone rubs you the wrong way even a *little* bit, you're not going to want to stick together on a walking journey together unless your life was in danger perhaps, but life or death situations never happened in this movie.  Then again the Pyrenees mountains are probably more dangerous than the way they're presented here since the film's going for a resolution vibe and not a dangerous one.  I was curious as to the reasons for the other characters tagging along with Martin, and we get those answers by the end.  The presentation is gorgeous and a high point of the movie.

Overall the Way is certainly memorable.  Perhaps it could've been sadder, but as it is it's strong enough to recommend for sure.  Then again maybe my emotions are just getting harder as I get older?  I recognize Martin lost his son, there's sad piano music often playing (and James Taylor and other familiar songs/artists too which is nice), but I just don't feel the sadness or the inspirational feeling that the movie is going for.  Still, great movie for the characters and the journey aspect which are both really high points.",1444003200,,3817,4.737160120845921

4866777,5,B005S9ELG2,"I personally thought it was a very endearing act for the father to carry on the pilgrimage that his Son had unfortunately been unable to complete.  It was well made and I enjoyed it very much.  The only missing factor, I felt, was it did not get into the details of how his Son actually lost his life.  It only gave the reason as an accident caused by the weather, which was known to be unpredictable.  I think it would have been a nice twist to the story for the Father to experience some similar bad weather, yet not loosing his life, or at least for some of the locals to mention to the Father, during the walk, about how treacherous the weather could be,or something relating to how his  Son encountered the bad storm and ultimately lost his life. Other than that it was a phenomenal. I loved it and I didn't want it to end.",1443916800,,828,4.248407643312102

The father takes the cremated remains of the son and scatters some of the remains along ""the way"". The father discovers his son's mindset.

That could be said for this movie in a lot of ways. However I still like the emotional value in this flick. Written and directed by Emilio Estevez and using his father Martin Sheen, he gives us a glimpse into why do we do the things we do and how different people deal with their choices. Father and son relationship issues are done pretty honestly and I applaud his efforts there. The characters are a bit over the top, but that's ok because choosing to walk The Way is too. Its not for everyone as it tries to reach into beliefs and values that may not ring true for many. While not overtly religious, it does open the subject as it must,  as this is a pilgrimage journey after all.

4868742,5,B005S9ELG2,"One of the best films I've seen over the last 4 years!

The film documents a disillusioned grad student looking to find a voice not shaped or formed by society and its material influences.

Estevez plays the disillusioned son who embarks off to walk the Camino, but meets an untimely end on his first day out.

Martin Sheen plays the Father is notified of his son's death and fly's to Spain to recover the remains. During this soul searching moment Martin suddenly decides to walk the Camino himself carrying the remains of his son Daniel! Besides emphasizing the intensely spiritual side of the journey which is highly personal to every real life person who sets out on the trail, the major theme of the film is to honor his son's life. While this is the catalyst for Sheen's character, he discovers something much more powerful and enduring for his own spiritual life.

The story unfolds as a group unites around the character of Sheen and the intensely personal reasons each has decided to walk this journey of inner reflection.

This is a highly entertaining film and methinks it speaks loudly to anyone unsatisfied with their life choices. Many in our contemporary circumstances - I think - are looking to take time away, to ponder, and reflect on their life choices. To go inside them selves and to find a spiritual meaning that they may have missed, lost, or forgotten.

The film might even motivate one to embark on this journey of discover and inner reflection. Who knows?",1437523200,,1481,4.743190661478599

The story line of Martin Sheen's father / son relationship is very similar to my oldest son and I, which is why it probably had such a profound effect on me and has inspired me to do the last leg of the Camino next year, about 120 miles over 8 days. The different stories of the people in the movie and why they are making the trip is inspiring and very life like, none of that Hollywood garbage. Perhaps that is why it is not very well known.

4869147,3,B005S9ELG2,"I think the writer in this movie must have written the script, but it didn't make it in my book. The movie drags on and on, with shallow characters and predictable script. I was telling my husband what the characters would do next. We stopped the movie part-way through to do the dinner dishes, and he asked if I wanted to watch something else. I told him it wasn't offensive enough to turn off, even though it wasn't interesting enough to continue. We opted to continue because I kept hoping there would be some redeeming value to spending the time. The scenery was very nice but not as spectacular as Montana, where I live, so I decided I don't need to go to Europe, LOL. Spiritually, the movie started out parched, stiff, decadent, bitter and sarcastic, and continued that way for far too long. Even the people they met along the way on the pilgrimage. At the end, I think I just felt relief that the trip was over and the ocean was beautiful...but the main feeling was nihilism, that nothing really means anything. I think it's partly because the characters are not developed enough for their evolution to be believable.",1437004800,,1124,4.597014925373134

Those who complain about the screen resolution need to understand that this whole film was shot with natural light. No artificial lighting, which makes the film that much more authentic. This is an historic, 1,000 year old Christian pilgrimage, and this movie honors that history. I'd give it more than 5 starts if I could.",1436918400,,475,4.666666666666667

4869189,4,B005S9ELG2,"This almost was a great film.  The main reason I knocked off a star is the music.  A film gets to burst into a great oldie song rendition once, or maybe twice, in order to punctuate some strong emotion.  Not a dozen times, though!  Still, except for this overused device, Estevez did a good job directing the film.  And it was interesting, sometimes funny, and I couldn't tell what was going to happen.  I was a little perplexed at the end--not to spoil things for others, I don't say exactly why, but it wasn't clear to me why one thing needed to occur.  Still, above average.

Starting out, I really did not like this movie and tried to sit thru the whole thing Saturday nite, but couldn't.  I pretty much made it thru the first 1.5 hrs, went to sleep and came back to it Sunday afternoon.
The LAST 15 minutes WOWED me, but not enuf to give it 4 or 5 stars -- mainly because the characters were pretty screwed up people.  I did not like them enuf to want to spend 2 hrs. of my Saturday nite w/ them.  (I can't stand shallow people.  (i.e., ""I'm on this pilgrimage to lose weight, to quit smoking, to write more"", blah, blah, blah -- drapery talk!  These are people who can't admit, they're on a pilgrimage because they're screwed up and don't like how their lives have turned out.)

The plot was believable. The direction very competent. Interesting background on this specific movie: Emilio is Martin Sheen's son. One of Martin Sheen's parents was from the Galicia region of Spain which is where the end of the movie is filmed. Dedicated to Martin's grandfather (I believe), the movie is about people and the many reasons why they might undertake a journey of sacrifice and discovery. The movie is well-suited for older children and adults. I don't think little children will understand the way the relationships reveal themselves so I would not recommend for them. There are references to adult themes by innuendo and conversation but, visually, is appropriate for older kids. I tip my hat to Emilio and Martin Sheen for having undertaken a movie founded in love and respect. Well done.",1436400000,2,969,5.217948717948718

It is getting more and more impossible to find movies by people in my generation (60's).  Nothing against the youngsters but we've already been there, done that.  Following a father's journey of homage to his son is at times hilarious as well as heartbreaking.  Very well done, great scenery, characters that are believable and interesting as well.

4870458,4,B005S9ELG2,"I'm giving this movie four stars but please, don't not misunderstand. It's not the four stars that I would give a fast paced action movie. I started out wondering how douchey Martin Sheen would be in the film- I mean those big dentures and the same stale acting in everything I've seen him do in recent years. As I read the synopsis, I noticed his son (Emilio Esteves) is also in the movie. I experienced an even greater internal eye roll. I figured this would be a bigger display of nepotism than anything. Perhaps it was a movie done for movies sake and it was going to be a pointless drag with mediocre acting. I decided to read other reviews. A few comments sparked my curiosity so I gave it a chance. The story is about loss, about finding uncommon friendships, about finding understanding, about finding meaning and finding peace. It's also a reminder that no matter what's going on in our lives- we all have ""things"" that hurt us or bother us; we has human beings have a common bond- no matter the nationality, social class, education, economic standing, gender, size etc. It's a reminder that we are capable of doing more than we realize (and for greater reasons than ourselves). There were a few times that the movie seemed a little slow. It would be kind of hard to tell a story like this and keep everything moving. Stories such as this cannot unfold in a quick way- otherwise, certain nuances and connections are lost. When you are ready for a slower paced, thought provoking movie, I highly recommend this one.",1434412800,,1523,4.582417582417582

As a fan of Martin Sheen I enjoyed his portrayal of Tom and his relaying the relationship of Tom to his son Daniel.  The fact that his own son, Emilio Estevez produced and directed the film, as well as playing the part Daniel, really drove home the connection between father and son.  Incorporating the history and beauty of The Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James, was appreciated and inspiring! This film is definitely worth watching, and may even inspire a trek along The Camino de Santiago!",1433808000,,571,4.69

The acting is for the most part very good. But like a lot of stories it went on a little too long and the final resolution was fairly predictable.

4871010,4,B005S9ELG2,A very good movie that I wasn't expecting because of never seeing any promos for it.

about this movie is watching Martin Sheen who always gives a moving and sensitive
performance as an actor.  It did not make me want to ""walk"" this path but it did revive
in me the desire to visit the Basque country.  Incidentally, a friend of mine recently walked
""the way"" and was quite disappointed in the experience.",1433721600,,404,4.583333333333333

Well directed, beautiful cinematography and a good balance of tears, laughter, reflection and motivation in this film.  My husband, who watched this at my request , was reluctant then delightfully surprised and deeply moved.  You may want to travel to Spain after this movie.

One more section to go before reaching Santiago and among my thoughts is the scene in the movie when this unlikely family reaches the Cathedral. While much is of ""Hollywood"" the reality is that you do meet wonderful personalities on the way. It is a transformational experience.",1433721600,,425,4.756756756756757
4871097,4,B005S9ELG2,"I hesitated to watch this, thinking it would quickly become mushy or syrupy.  Not so. Apart from the expected excellent performance from Martin Sheen, Emilio Estevez creates a thoughtful, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes whimsical and always nicely filmed movie. The characters are believable, the story is well-paced and the many scenes that stuck in my mind are a good indication that I really liked the film. A few scenes that felt a bit forced, but overall a great story.

It was hard, of course, not to see this as President Bartlett on the Camino, and to hope that Josh Lyman would suddenly appear as a sort of Sancho Panza.",1433721600,,639,4.8

If one waits for a big climax, there isn't one but rather an unfolding of the plot.  The scenery is great and the photography is also noteworthy.  One can almost believe they are there with the actors because  it could be a day in anyones life.  No big movie tricks.  So if you are up to a calming an thoughtful movie this may be for you.  If you are looking for some kind of big action then keep looking because this one won't knock your socks off but is still worth the investment.",1433289600,,577,4.287037037037037

This story was talking me. Next morning I told my wife about it and decided to buy a copy. I went to Amazon and just for kicks I read all the reviews, both good and bad. I was amazed by the number of people who had made this pilgrimage and by the many who now plan to. The bad reviews complained about the lack of quality of the actors, the story being shallow, lack of romance, it should have more of this and less of that! The actors were great, but in this story it doesn't really matter, it is the story that is talking to you. Some people are in awe of a sunset while others rather watch bowling on TV. Different strokes for different folks. This is a powerfully written story and a great presentation of that story. It is not so much a religious narrative but more about  choices, changes, challenges, consequences, and fulfilling goals. I will be telling many more friends about this movie. Hope you get as much out of it as many of us have.",1433289600,10,1118,4.273584905660377

Since then, my Mom died and I had the urge to do The Camino. Granted it was only the last 126k of the French Way but that was only the beginning of my desire to start from St. Jean Pied du Port, France like Martin Sheen did in the movie. My husband and I started the French Way last October 2014, from the same hotel where Martin Sheen was shown leaving for the Camino on his first day! How he could walk 800km with absolutely no physical preparation and only his dead son's gear to see him through is a bit questionable but, barring that, I just love watching the movie over and over again. It captures so well the depth of mourning the loss of a loved one, each pilgrim's desire to doThe Camino so varied as each person who walks The Way and the camaraderie you find among your fellow travelers as you go through this long, arduous but beautiful journey. I had to buy my own copy of the movie since I no longer have it on my streaming video service and I like watching this film to remind me The Camino is not just the physical journey across Spain but the journey that is our lives.",1433116800,,1242,4.11522633744856

4871613,5,B005S9ELG2,"What a story! I could so see myself making such a journey; hopefully not for the same reason though. The only scene that I found objectionabe/regrettable is when Tom is at his ""home"" church and the priest asks him to pray. Tom asks ""why"", and the priest seemingly has no answer.

4871694,4,B005S9ELG2,This is my second viewing of this movie - the first was when it first came out. My sister embarked on a portion of the pilgrimage depicted in the movie this week and I wanted to see what it would be like for her. I think I liked it even better this time viewing it more from the perspective of the individuals instead of dispassionately from a distance. What an experience and the mission one starts with is never the actual lesson learned.,1432771200,,440,4.313253012048193

4871699,5,B005S9ELG2,"I agree with others that this is a modern Canterbury Tales. This movie is profound and is a hidden jewel that offers so much on so many emotional levels. It has human interest. Many of the characters are well developed and contain their own human interest stories. The movie is also culturally interesting.  There was some fine acting in this movie, especially by Martin Sheen. I won't tell you the plot. You can read the description and I refuse to make my review a spoiler. Watch this movie. You won't be sorry.  It made me laugh out loud at points and then rapidly brought me to tears. What a roller coaster of an emotional ride! I enjoyed experiencing the range of emotions. It taught lessons in life. What more can one ask from the movie entertainment industry?",1432425600,,766,4.583941605839416

4871761,5,B005S9ELG2,A moving account of a father and son who bond more closely through an amazing and tragic turn of events - even though one of them has passed from this world.

4872086,5,B005S9ELG2,"It's spiritually inspiring, the movie. It is not typical for Americans to go on such a journey however, it is for Europeans and therefore this movie might be a little out of Americans League of understanding. But I think anybody who had their mid life crisis or quarter crisis can relate to the quest one has within themselves,  but yet is lacking understanding or direction of what that is. Hopefully going on such a journey will help you find it or discover what is all inside of you that could indicate a mark(s) of one's own quest.",1431734400,,535,4.515463917525773
4872097,4,B005S9ELG2,"The film begins with what is perhaps not the most original premise (following a path driven by the loss of a loved one), and one not adequately explained in its details (i.e. what mental chemistry led to the decision to walk 650 km).  But the main character's trek nonetheless leads to some very interesting interplay between characters on the same path for very different reasons.  The only complaint here is that with another 7 to 10 minutes several of the other main characters could have been cloaked in deeper background to give greater explanation to their motivations.  There is a religious layer in the overall concoction but one that even a thinking agnostic would not find offensive or out of place, either intellectually or geographically. The settings were very easy on the eye and made me want to get on my hiking boots.  Martin Sheen's acting skills were not especially well directed in the film, as he has done better and might have been facilitated more effectively, particularly in a scene involving a meltdown. Still, he is a very good actor and his companions performed very well in support.  It isn't quite on par with The Wild, I watched the film twice and found it sufficiently engaging  and of sufficient depth to give it a reasonably strong rating.  It would be 3.5 stars if the scale allowed.",1431734400,,1317,4.775330396475771

It has been a long long time since watching an inspiring movie with depth, meaning, and value for it was about the Interior of a person's soul rather than the exterior behaviors and ways.  It reminded me somewhat of the old b/w movies entitled ""BERNADETTE""  and  ""BROTHER SUN AND SISTER MOON"".  The storyline, the scenery, the songs, the actors, the pace  kept me intently and intensely watching.  And the last 20 minutes found me mesmerized, almost holding my breath, as I anticipated how each of the 4 travelers would respond when they were face to face with the holy site of their primary destination and what they would do to express their decision or choice.  I am entirely grateful and am blessed to have seen this movie.

4872602,5,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is the story of an American ophthalmologist (Tom), a man in his sixties, who receives word that his son, Daniel, has died in France. Daniel had died in a storm in the Pyrenees mountains after being only one day on his journey down the Santiago de Compostela Camino (The Camino). Tom travels to France to retrieve Daniel's body and learns there the facts surrounding his death and his quest. He also learns about the Camino and so makes a connection between his estranged relationship to his dead son, and his son's desire to make the pilgrimage. So he decides to make the Camino journey himself, scattering Daniel's ashes along the way.

In making the journey, Tom encounters some fellow pilgrims who become his reluctant (to him) partners. One is a Dutchman with an appreciation of recreational drugs, a Canadian woman who is walking to find the strength to quit smoking, and an an Irish writer who is seeking to overcome his ""block."" Tom's challenge is to overcome his own cold veneer and learn to open up to life and to the goodwill of others.

Walking the Camino is an act of faith. It is one that most people, in modern society, will judge as crazy for all but the religiously fanatic (often judged as a kind of insanity). It is one of those acts that takes one outside the norm of existence and threatens to expose the bankruptness of a normal, day-to-day life. It is therefore both understandable and dangerous. This idea is expressed in the movie in an early scene of Tom's remembrance of a conversation with Daniel about his choice of life vocation (or his ""non-choice""). Daniel had said to his father:

""You don't choose a life, dad. You live one.""

Tom can't understand what his son is saying here. How many parents do? We want our children to be safe and cared for, so that they don't suffer in their lives. We want them to have the assurance of no worries about food, shelter, clothing, and all the extras. If we wish them spiritual comfort, it is usually in the form of religous dogmas. What if they figure out for themselves that thing we are missing? They might want to walk the Camino, and place greater value on that experience than the sum of Bill Gates' checking account. Can we accept that? Understand it? If we're lucky, maybe we'll take up the quest ourselves.

The Way is a quiet expression of faith. Not in the religious sense, but in a deeper, spiritual one that affirms universal good and its power of transformation. The central character, Tom, has grown to middle-age, closed off from love of family and friends by a shell hardened over time. The breaking of that shell is the Camino's lesson for Tom that leaves him a better person.

The Way is a movie to inspire those looking to break whatever forms their emotional bondage and open up to appreciate the love around them.",1431043200,,2811,4.600798403193613
4872603,5,B005S9ELG2,"This is a wonderful movie.  There are no special effects, action scenes, or car chases.  It is just a lovely story.  The movie was so inspirational to my husband and me that we made the trip to the Camino the summer of 2012 after we saw the movie the previous fall.  We love the movie and watch it again and again.  The movie is true to the spirit of the Camino.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a love of travel, enjoys meeting new people,and loves a long walk!  The movie inspired in us an entirely different way to travel.

I have purchesed multiple copies to give to many friends. Anyone would love the father-son story but the friendship of the four who get together is so uplifting.

Pluses:  The scenery is spectacular as is the cinematography.  The acting is pretty good and the casting is fine.

Minuses:  The plot is pretty predictable.  Obviously a labor of love between dad and kid.

As this long journey unfolds, the layers peel away on each of the troubadours.  We see all manner of the circles of hell they are living in.
Their encounter with the gypsies creates a turning point that I will not reveal, but will say it illuminates this religious journey beyond the saints and the stars and into that netherworld where we are washed clean and lay bare our sorrow and pain and become one with the everlasting universe.",1429574400,,716,4.476923076923077

4873865,4,B005S9ELG2,"Seemed like a pleasant movie. But given all the hullabaloo by conservative religious types over this movie, there seemed to be one significant irony to it all. It prominently feature songs by boomer bard James Taylor. That wouldn't be a surprise given his near universal  popularity. But it is interesting that James Taylor is an agnostic, whose songs have often been misinterpreted as being religious. As this blog info tells us: ""Taylor had little religious upbringing to speak ofother than that he grew up in the south. His father was a doctor and a scientist and Taylor said of him:

Growing up in North Carolina, I missed the boat on most religions. My dad was basically an atheist or at best an agnostic. 1

Many of his songswhile often wrongly considered to be spiritual in some way or anotherare actually more anthems to the opposite. He even called his album, Hourglass, a series of spirituals for agnostics. 2 Many have misinterpreted the line look down upon me, Jesus in perhaps his biggest hit, Fire and Rain, to be a Christian tribute. But in fact, Taylor was writing about withdrawals from heroin and saying Jesus as a response to being in pain. 3

In all, Taylor is an explicitly non-religious person. But that doesnt mean he doesnt feel some spiritual connection. He said:

I have a very strong spiritual need. And getting into nature is going to church for me. Its my way of surrendering to the bigger picture, to the whole. I feel the skin of life on the planet as a sort of co-evolved life form Its my own belief that [nature] is alive, a single organism on this amazing, rare, and perhaps unique planet. I really need to feel that connection. 4

Taylor seems to express a rather pantheistic worldview with this quote and is by no means an atheist, rather, he just doesnt find what he needs in institutional, organized religions.

An Unabashed Liberal

Taylor has dubbed himself an unabashed liberal5 and has championed progressive left-leaning politics for most of his career.

Taylor, much like his religious views, credits his political positions to his parents, who were academic progressives during Taylors childhood. He said:

My parents commitment to education and public health  to the civil rights movement  was something I was aware of at a very early age  That kind of altruistic gene is something Im very proud of. It rubbed off. 6

To this day, Taylor is an idealist. Hed rather avoid the nuts and bolts of politics:

I don't get into heavy political numbers because I don't find them lyrical. 7

But well be happy to get into political numbers. Taylor has, in his lifetime, donated $32,300 to political candidates and causesall Democrat. Most of that (over $30,000) went to Barack Obama.""",1428969600,,2721,4.794432548179872

4874010,5,B005S9ELG2,"With actors like Emilio Estevez and his father Martin Sheen, how could this movie go wrong?  The acting and the story line are truly inspirational.  It is the story of a man's pilgrimage to a church on the West coast of Spain.  It is a fairly well-known Christian pilgrimage, with the journey itself (not the church) being the life-changing/-affirming component.  The man played by Martin Sheen knew nothing of the pilgrimage before he embarked upon it, so the viewer gets to watch the spiritual awakening of his and several other characters.  I viewed this movie with a small Episcopal study group and had to have my own copy.  Some low key drug use and profanity but still worthwhile for high school and older.",1425772800,,712,4.747967479674797

4874075,5,B005S9ELG2,"Well, I procrastinated long enough. I guess I didn't trust Mr. Estevez to possess the ability to write and direct a film that involves a grief-stricken man embarking on a grueling pilgrimage, and still deliver a plot that doesn't  cause the viewer to sob every 10 minutes. I am depressed enough from my own troubles. I am so glad I gave this a chance because there was enough distraction provided by other characters, including some humorous, to invoke a very rewarding film experience. Don't get me wrong, I did grab the box of tissues, but it was a good kind of cry. Well done Emilio Estevez, you managed to make my laugh and cry, feel inspired and learn some new things about this world. And when the end of the film was approaching, I lamented that I didn't want it to end just yet; I wanted more.

4874114,5,B005S9ELG2,"I have seen this movie several times and look forward to the next viewing.  Go with Tom into his grieving process and his decision to make the pilgrimage that his late son had begun.  This is not a spoiler because the son's untimely death comes out early in the film.  Be another pilgrim on the trail as Tom, against his will at first, begins to collect people.  Fall in love with each of the characters, and determine his or her unique motivation for making the pilgrimage.  Then watch the movie again, knowing what you know, and relish more than ever the nuances of the actors' expression in earlier scenes.  Appreciate the fact that real Roma people (pejoratively called Gypsies) were used to film that scene of revelry, that they worked conscientiously on the set, and did not steal anything--the opposite of what had been predicted about them.  For a while, I have said that I do not have a favorite movie, that with so many candidates on the landscape, it's impossible to pick only one.  However, this film changed my mind.  I dare you to watch it without shedding a tear by the time the huge incense pot swings near the end.

(The Big Fish, James and the Giant Peach, Harold and Maude are a few examples.) We each walk a personal road to ourselves and our lives and our own salvation and meaning as human beings. In a way, the masterful direction by the son of his father actor expresses a type of redemption of both. The story itself is beautiful. Emilio Estevez has done a wonderful job, and Martin Sheen could not be finer in this role.

Not a ""chick flick."" This is a movie that can be shared by girlfriends on movie night for sure, and it should also be shared with your family, is a manly story, and could be shown in neighborhood get-togethers (depending on the neighbors.) It's also suitable for solitary viewing, and has become a go-to as I wander through a strained time anticipating my father's death and contemplating our lives.

4874318,4,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is a simple movie about Tom, a father (Martin Sheen) of a 40 year old son who dies in France whose lifestyle of wanting to travel the world rather than do the daily grind ""your supposed to"" was looked down upon and argued against by him while he was alive. Before his son got on the plane at the end of their argument about him going, he told Tom 'You don't choose a life, you live one"". The film doesn't really mention how he died, the vague mention of a storm by the Dutch walker is the only reference we get. Tom after being given his son's backpack and other possessions by the French police and being told of the pilgrimage track across Northern Spain his son was trying to achieve, including a pretty much empty to be stamped at each town track passport, decides to help his son complete that goal by putting on his gear and carrying his ashes, spreading them along the route. Although his son is always pictured in an orange hiking jacket, for some reason it is blue when Tom wears it. There's a few odd things like this such as a French policeman who gets out of a car he's supposedly driving while it's still moving to wish him well and give him a rock and tells him he'll know what to do with it when he sees it. This guy must be really into doing this as suddenly everyone has one of these rocks in their pocket when they reach this thing.

But overall it's a nice movie, it's not a tearjerker like they could have gone with, instead it's just a nice coming of age story (if you can call what a bunch of elderly backpackers go through that), about realising his son's line of living a life isn't a bad concept. Sheen does a good job of playing both sides of that outlook on life. As someone who started backpacking the US, in my late teens and then Europe and other places I could relate to his son's outlook and the conversations you have with relatives, work colleagues and such, especially elderly ones who just don't get it. I found it a bit odd that every person he comes across (except the Dutch guy who plays an overbearingly friendly guy) is hostile at first. What exactly did the Dutch guy think made up the ashes he sees him spreading before he was shocked it was his son. I would think a child or partner would be what most people would naturally assume upon seeing someone do this. The hostels he stays are pretty bad, I find it hard to imagine there aren't better ones forcing these ones to improve due to competition in each town. Perhaps if this was set in the 90's or earlier before backpacking took off culturally this might have made more sense, but I guess it was highlighting the rich businessman lifestyle Tom has in the US compared to that of a backpacker, but those sort of nightmare dormitories are what those with his character's outlook on backpackers picture in their minds as one of the justifications for why they would never do it.

Overall, although The Way is pretty predictable, it's a nice journey there with some nice scenery along the way.",1417392000,,2994,4.363799283154122

The film being modern, and modernist, it flinched from really embracing the actual Catholicism of the pilgrimage--partially turning it into a new age type theme.

I did not have the same experience watching it. I saw little value in Emilio Estevez popping in and out of scenes periodically.

It was good to see the terrain and hostels, to see the path that everyone walked. Since I will never see Spain again, and will never walk the Way, that was good. I was awed by the cathedral and the huge incense burner and how it swung the length of the cathedral.

For me, the story line was simply boring. There wasn't much about the characters I liked or wanted to identify with. The conversations were meaningless. The ending of the film a total disappointment.

4874450,5,B005S9ELG2,"Remember that this is just a movie; and should you one day walk the Camino your experience may be far different from the film.  The joy of this story is the theme of integration; that is, someone who is alone and bereft of true community and acceptance finds himself blooming in the human community and joyful among a group he happens to meet.  But is this not often life when we finally surrender ourselves to its realities and gifts and abandon trying to control everything?  I have only walked part of the Camino and have yet to complete it.  And I did, indeed, encounter trials like but unlike those of the protagonist.  Aging and out of shape, I was startled to find myself repeatedly trudging up long steep climbs to mountaintop villages then plunging down hazardous descents on poorly maintained trails; yet I managed them all and grew strong in will and body.  I had no idea that humans would so litter the landscape, something not shown in the movie.  Yet, in all of that, I know the movie caught a common element with reality and that is that the Camino will change us for better, radically, if we are open. Martin Sheen is his best in this film; his son shows his genius in the production.  And I watch it whenever I find myself at odds with commercialism and our culture.

Soundtrack excellent also which complements the spiritual contemplation which is part of this movie.

One big surprise for me was how Martin Sheen's character went from relatively anti-social--making this pilgrimage to honor and understand his son better--to a person who others wanted around them and by the end, that was what he too wanted.  In addition to delivering an uplifting message, it is quirky in a really cool way.

4874685,5,B005S9ELG2,"This movie was recommended to me by a female physician who saw it on a religious retreat.  Just her brief explanation of its premise prompted me to check and see if it was a Prime eligible offering; it was.  What a fine film this was.

Martin Sheen (an actor I always loved) is an eye doctor who lives a pretty ordinary life.  His son (played by real son actor Emilio Estevez) has a bit of a strained relationship with him because he had more of a rebellious and adventurous nature.  You don't know that much about him other than he left college and a degree in Anthropology early so he could actually travel the world and see it for himself instead.  While embarking on a famous pilgrimage, his son suddenly dies in a bad storm.  The father has to travel there to identify his son's body.  While doing so, he decides to take up his son's unfinished journey. So, he has his son cremated and straps the boxed ashes to his son's backpack.  Using his son's hiking supplies, he completes his son's intended journey on foot, making colorful acquaintances along the way.

This was an interesting film as it documented the journey itself, with its sights, sounds, hostels, bed and breakfasts, etc.  It was also very poignant for realizing his son's journey as well as the reasons that prompted his fellow travelers to make this religious pilgrimage.",1412380800,,1342,4.620253164556962

Actors are so believable that you feel that this is a documentary.  Very touching emotionally and as you watch the actors emotionally evolve, so does the viewer. This film is for all adults of modern society and with any kind of emotional history and it has nothing to do with religion, although it causes one to question and consider his/her own values/beliefs, treatment of others, and perhaps to adjust how we view, behave and judge or not judge ourselves and others going forward in this life.  I purchased this video for my adult daughter, mainly because of the way it deals with unforgiveness and forgiveness.",1411430400,,786,4.902255639097745

I'm undecided whether to give it five or four stars - indeed it may merit five. In any case, a quiet, moving, understated drama that brought tears to my eyes several times.

I think it's unrealistic that Martin Sheen's character made an impulsive decision to go on a 500-mile walk without any prior training and never showed that he had any difficulty, no sore feet, no deep exhaustion, etc.  He's over 60 in the movie, by the way.

The mystery behind the supporting characters seemed to last throughout the movie, and left you wondering if someone was really holding on to a deeper secret as to why they were making the journey.

Along El Camino he meets all kinds of people, each with his own personal motivations and preocupations, not necessarily of a religious nature.
The film could be seen as a guide to El camino: as the man progresses we see different landscapes, rivers, mountains. He arrives at all sorts of inns that cater to the pilgrims., and at the end, when he arrives at the sanctuary he achieves an understanding of his son.

It shows us many of the positive and negative aspects of our humanity which we experience during our lives. We make good and bad decisions. Learning how to discern the difference and how to care are some of the the things we might battle with on our way. We all have our way to walk, our life. We don't get to choose our life, we just get to choose how we react to it and what we do with our time. Sometimes we can accomplish our dreams, and sometimes we realize we were naive, or expected to much, or don't want to be selfish enough to gain the goals we once had. Sometimes we just have to experience things with others even if they are not the friends or companions we expected to find.

I've always been a fan of Martin Sheen and in this instance both performances of father as actor and son as creative force are quite the dynamic duo.

The panoramic vistas along the journey are lovely.

It was not what I expected and really struck home to me. I recently lost my job of almost 9 years. This movie is about loss. It reminded me of what is important in life.

Martin Sheen is a bit to stoic for the role and we never get the emotional breakdown the movie needs to give it some emotional depth.

Sorry to say but I'd never been a big Martin Sheen fan but he did a great job in this, as I expect the role was designed around his personality.  This movie could be a great character study.

In a nutshell, a father flies to France to resume the body of his son who wanted to travel the world and died on his beginning walk (a pilgrimage walk) from France to Santiago Spain.  The father decides to go it alone for the sake of his departed son.  Very moving one month journey, and along the way he meets up a Dutchman, a Canadian woman , and an Irishman.

It's about finding yourself, friendship, loyalty, dedication, and culture.  Nice movie. buen camino!",1401580800,,802,4.342281879194631

But this little film packs a double punch of fine acting all around and an original story written by Emilio  Estevez, son of the lead actor Martin Sheen. The setting is also the star; I've just returned from a trekking trip in Northern Spain and have walked segments of the route to Santiago de Compostela.

You can never go wrong with Martin Sheen, and what a wonderful supporting cast he had. His son, Emilio Estevez directed and also plays his son in the film.  This was a fantastic, beautifully done film, even with a somber tone that it starts with. I highly recommend for both viewing and purchasing.  This is one that you will want to watch again and again, at least I will.  And we definitely need to see more work from Emilio! This was a spectacular film!",1401148800,,614,4.495495495495495

4875762,5,B005S9ELG2,"As a recovering Catholic, I've enjoyed Martin Sheen's blatant attempts to endear the Church, or to make it compatible with the 21st century. For me, The Way embraces my sense of parenthood and a loving father-son relationship. Without the discomfort, the uncertainty, or 'everything is smooth' now-what sense, parenthood does not end at 18, 21, or graduation from high school or college. It does take young men longer to mature! At least in my family, that's been the case.

The ambiguity between father and son compares with mother-daughter; not always, but from my experience. But, The Way does not preach, nor proselytize about your faith or Sheen's. The Christianity is part of the human drama, not the central focus in this particular film. It breathes, as Sheen walks, stumbles, makes friends (slowly), encounters villagers, and stays the distance. Courageous work of art! For Martin Sheen's fans, and haven't ordered already, The Way will wait. Can you?",1401062400,,960,5.153846153846154

About a bunch of people that go on a journey to find themselves. I think it was supposed to be inspirational but it left me thinking that people in Hollywood really have no idea how real people live. Who could just leave their job, home and responsibilities to go for a long walk? No one I know! LOL I guess it was just a little too out there for my tastes. But I still love Martin Sheen.

I kept seeing my Dad when I saw Tom.  I saw a best friend in the Dane and the writer from the UK.  I saw someone I know in the smoker girl. And sadly, my daughter in Daniel.  She was killed just a few months ago and sits in an urn on my fireplace now.  The first time I saw this I was deeply moved.  The second time, tonight, I was frequently in tears, but laughed too.  I don't watch a movie to cry, but to be taken out of this place.  'The Way' does that to me and it's not an easy thing to do.  Yes the character development is about as good as it gets.  The cinematography is just beautiful.  The musical score just rocks!  To me it's the best thing Martin and Emilio have done.  I truly wish Lindsey Taylor Ranz could have seen this.

I have been a fan of Martin Sheen ever since Apocalypse Now! and he does a fine job in this film.  It is good to see that one of his sons has matured into a fine director.  The setting for the film has beauty, history and a lifestyle that I will only get to experience on film.

I've done a bit of backpacking here in the US and have stayed in a few 50 bunk huts in the White Mountains so I could relate to a lot of this movie. It deals with the loss of a son and how the father deals with that and grows as a result. Very well done. Good acting. Makes me want to dig out my pack and start planning!

Once the connection of the core group to the main characters in the Wizard of Oz was suggested, I saw the journey in yet another way.

It covers the pilgrimage walk from France to Spain  that St. James took and is walked by thousands of people each year, Camino de Santiago.

After reading several blogs about walking the trail, one common thread kept popping up in the blogs and comments from others: the desire to walk the Camino de Santiago after watching ""The Way."" This movie has helped my husband understand what the trek is, why people travel it, and basics on how to do it. He was totally wowed. So was I. The movie itself is about a father who does not understand why his adult son wants to walk the trek, then through a series of events, the father discovers he needs to walk the trek himself, during which he comes to understand his son, and learn a great deal about himself. It's realistic, not sappy or predictable.",1397865600,,819,4.609589041095891

4875988,5,B005S9ELG2,"I don't know exactly how to describe why I liked this film so much. All I can say is that every time I look at it I find something else to notice and love and I've looked at it several times in just one week.  It's one of those LITTLE FILMS that just grab you from the very start.  I love Martin Sheen of course, always have.  In his older age he has certainly not lost his touch. His expression when he views his son's body is great acting.  Another scene when he opens the door of his hotel room to find the woman standing there is another priceless moment. The other 3 people are actors that I don't ever recall seeing before but all are wonderful.  They never seem to be acting, they seem to be real people in a real situation which, of course, is what excellent acting is all about. James Nesbitt is wonderful.  His facial expressions alone are enough to make you love the movie.  There are no huge dramatic moments but lots and lots of little dramatic moments in this film.  It seems to be a film about people who are hurt in some way and without making a big deal of their own story they sort of pretend that it's really just a small thing that has brought them on this journey.  The relationship between the people happens very gradually and is a very moving thing to watch. I have worked with doctors for over 40 years and I was particularly moved by the way he changes from the know it all, omnipotent DOCTOR person to a normal human being. I do want to mention that it is beautifully filmed with gorgeous scenery..  For a walking along the road film it never drags, the viewer is never bored.  I recommend it highly. In thinking over this film I'm moved to wonder how Emilio turned out so beautifully and Charlie turned out to be such a total piece of crap.  I wonder if Martin ever wonders about that. I understand that both boys were pretty much turned loose to do as they pleased at a very young age.  One turned his life around and the other one never did.  Emilio is beautiful in this movie. What a great face. BTW - Be sure to view the film again with the comments as they are really wonderful. I've ordered the book ""Along the Way"" and can't wait to read it.

The story of a fathers journey and sorrow was ok but the interaction with other characters was the real story. No sex, gore, or outlandish special effects was also refreshing.

Tom was a sad, lonely man - his son, Daniel, wanted to be on his own and pretty much refused to 'be' what his father wanted him to be.  Daniel was adventurous, spontaneous and independent and wanted to see the world.  Tom was conservative and seemed to be a bit on the angry side.  When Tom embarked on his journey to 'walk in Daniel's footsteps', he initially refused to see the beauty in living.  Rather, he just wanted to retrieve his son and return to his normal way of life.  It was quite moving to see Tom morph into a person that found his 'Way' of LIVING his life and LOVING his own self.  Tom found not only himself but also found his son to be a beautiful, loving individual.

Martin Sheen is wonderful as the bereaved father whose son had decided to take the walk, but was killed early on in a freak storm. He takes the ashes and decides to finish what his son had started.

Martin Sheen's character undergoes a physical and metaphysical journey that rings true and kept me interested the whole way.

It is classic in the same sense as Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"".",1392508800,,375,4.8125

Here a grief stricken father finds himself unintentionally walking a path that his deceased son had planned to walk against the father's wishes.  What the father discovers along the path is not only a fuller love and understanding of his son, but a blossoming of his own outlook on life.

The message I received is to keep the flame of youthful curiosity and adventure burning bright within us so that our journey of life stays fresh and alive.  The storms and battles of life experiences can easily blow out the flame that lights our way along the path, leaving us lost within ourselves.  It might take the fearless, stubborn innocence of youth to rekindle a purpose driven life.

About a dozen of my friends and I watched it. Several have watched it again, some multiple times (me). And, most of the group is now seriously talking about walking the Camino, biking the Camino, or doing a bus tour of the Camino. It has changed the lives of most of the people in my group, including mine. We are energized and inspired. The oldest member of our social group, who is in his 70's, has started training for it, starting with walking 6 miles a day. If you like to travel, like good food and red wine, and are fine with simple lodgings on a trip, you will love this movie. The first time you see it, you will not know what hit you. The second time, you will begin to understand what you need to do if you want to chase the emotions it stirs up. I have begun my training for the Camino and am getting my gear together.

4876568,5,B005S9ELG2,"ok, so there's a woman in this story. ***SPOILER ALERT***. I thought part way into this, ""Oh, great, a woman who is neither morbidly obese nor elderly, therefore merely an object to pursue and conquer to have a relationship, not to be treated as simply a human being on a journey"". I found myself very pleasantly surprised that indeed, her role in the story was not an object to conquer, but rather a human being on a journey. AWESOME!!!! They also talked about her past a bit, and she was really treated as a human being who had undergone her own suffering, I heard only one comment about her physical appearance (pretty, I think, or something to that effect). I didn't notice any sexual undertones (such as the all-too-typical man looking like he's doing disgusting mental mast----tion and camera zoom in on bottom, I didn't notice any of that) or lusting after her, either. This is refreshing to watch with my two teenage boys. ok, so besides that refreshing role of a woman as a genuine human being, it also had a great story line. If you are planning to watch this with kids, the beginning is a bit slow. I probably would wait until they are teens.

4876592,5,B005S9ELG2,"The Way
Meet Tom, 60-something, an eye doctor with a successful practice.  We learn his son Dan, 40-ish, has dropped out of his PhD program after his mom passed away.  Tom cant understand his sons choices and while driving him to the airport is invited by his son to take the journey with him.  He tells his dad that Margaret Meade didn't become famous by studying but by getting out in the world and that his Dad should travel more.  Dan wants to travel.  Apparently his mothers early death taught him something about life that his father had yet to learn.  Tom confronts him for the last time about finding something and sticking to it.  Dan replies, you chose your life, you're a doctor, and thats fine, but some people choose their life and other people live their life.  Yes I could hear Auntie Mame in the background of my mind extorting us on the banquet of life to live, live, live!

He wishes his son well and goes on about his doctor life, apparently on the golf course engaging in witty successful guy golf repartee with his doctor buddies when his mobile rings.
His son has been killed on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage by a freak storm.  And in the next scene we see him identifying his sons body.  After collecting his sons things, all the equipment you need to make the 2 month walk through the mountains, he returns to the Gendarmerie, and tells them to cremate his son.  He then sets off with Dans walking stick, backpack, sleeping bag and ashes and heads onto the trail.

Along the way he meets a variety of characters and the question why are you walking the way? reveals deeper truths about each of the characters upon which our hero can reflect.  Theres Joost, the overweight Dutchman, with the special cigarettes and anything you need to sleep from Ambien to ear plugs.  Theres Sarah, the blonde smartass beauty, who is pretending shes walking in order to give up her cigarette habit at the end and which she indulges at every opportunity.

The Way is supposed to be cathartic and a source of healing and miracles.  Shes hoping to exorcise her demons.  Theres Jack from Ireland, the blocked writer hoping to find a story.  And others come in and out of their journey adding spice to the mix.  Along the way he is distributing his sons ashes until the encounter with gypsies, a true plot point, in which hes advised to save the ashes and at the end of the journey hell know what to do.

At the end our four travelers are standing at the desk getting their Compostella passbooks stamped for the last time and receiving their certifications that they finished their journeys.  And each of them are asked their name, if they walked the whole way and did each stop as directed and finally why they made their journey.  Jack from Ireland says he was searching for leprechauns at the end of the way.  Our chain smoking blonde says religion and our overweight Dutchman says he wanted to lose weight because his wife wouldnt sleep with him anymore.  Tom gives his name but has a hard time answering the why.

It is not a spoiler to reveal that Tom answers he thought he should travel more and upon seeing his certificate advises the attendant that hes given him the wrong name and asks if he can change it to Dan.  That his father completed the journey with him even in death provides healing and understanding to our hero.
This movie is not about the end of course, its about the journey and its lesson is that life too is about the journey and not about what you become but who you are and not how you die but what you do with the days you have until you die.  And for the millions of us lapsed Catholics it rips a special hole in our hearts and offers the promise that we not hold our disappointment with our church and our hatred for those who erect and maintain those Temples of Tears around the world but the simple message that Jesus wants us to be there for one another and that if we love each other we will find our salvation.

Perhaps its time to forgive the Church that has betrayed humanity and rediscover the true meaning of Jesus love.  Now don't think for one moment this movie is preachy, religious or about Jesus and miracles.  It is not.  As Sarah says while lighting up yet another cigarette - This was never about quitting these things.  But you knew that.  Yes.  I get it now.

If finding your inner Jesus is one possible outcome so much the beter.  For each of us this movie will be something special  this film was an act of love.  And its love thats the underlying theme and the thread that ties all the parts together.  This film moved me in unexpected ways.  It found a chink in my jaded armor and wiggled its way in.

4876695,5,B005S9ELG2,"When I saw the trailer for The Way my initial thought was that it was filled with so many potential landmines that it was going to be impossible to keep it from blowing up.  As the story progressed I was delighted and impressed that Estevez and Sheen chose to side-step these pitfalls and turn out a truly compelling, touching and well-paced film.  Here's where they nailed it instead of blowing it:

1.  Father/son relationship - It's clear from the trailers that the relationship between father and son are strained, but the real-life father and son chose to play this out in a touching way.  There is no deep analysis, no complex explanation, and no SoCal psychobabble.  The depiction is two individuals with differing views and it's left at that.

2.  Death - The film begins with the son's death and gets that out of the way early.  Estevez and Sheen build upon that whole father/son thing and handle Sheen's reactions with a mixture of courage and frailty that tip-toe an amazingly narrow window that veers neither into becoming maudlin or dismissive.  Sheen's simple conviction to finish the pilgrimage is handled with simplistic dignity without any grandiosity.

3. The Camino - As lovely and compelling as the road itself is, Estevez refuses to allow the scenery to overtake the story.  The scenery is breathtaking but not over-romanticized.  The towns and paths have the reality of grit and realistic weather so that their presence doesn't detract from the point of the pilgrimage.

4.  Keeping the story moving - Trek movies have the challenge of weaving a compelling story into what is in and of itself a mundane chore: slogging mile after mind-numbing mile toward an objective.  Estevez appears to have taken a page from David Lynch's acclaimed The Straight Story (about an octogenarian's 240-mile mission across Northern Iowa on a riding lawnmower to see his estranged brother) in keeping the encounters fresh and compelling along the way.

5.  The fellowship of pilgrims - Sheen accumulates a small band of fellow travelers with a balanced mixture of reluctance and acceptance.  The fellow travelers are developed gradually, as is Sheen's interaction with them.  Each of them is flawed, endearing, infuriating, and wholly believable.  Perhaps the best scene in the movie is toward the end where they know each other (and we them) so well that an entire conversation is held solely from facial expressions.  The unspoken words are loud and clear and Estevez hit the jackpot with this bit of cinematic slight of hand.

Simply put this is a refreshing throw-back to the days of a movie telling a story, and a good one at that, through thoughtful writing, careful direction and craftful acting.  For Sheen and Estevez this had to be a labor of love and Sheen's pride in his son's efforts shone through with a masterful performance.  This will be on my see-over-and-again list.",1390262400,,2887,4.939834024896266

4876714,5,B005S9ELG2,"This is a wonderful, uplifting movie.  I have always been curious about the Camino to Santiago.  What a soulful introduction.  The characters, the scenery and the storyline are all deeply gratifying.  Martin Sheen plays a man living in California with a comfortable, white collar profession.  His son, played by Emilio Estevez, has been a disappointment to him. Events take Martin Sheen's character (Tom) to France, then through the Pyrenees to Spain on the pilgrimage trail to Santiago.  Along the way he meets people very different from himself but who also are on a journey.  There are many touching and heartfelt moments along the way, and the ending is satisfying.  We are left with the distinct feeling that Tom has changed for the better, and that his journey toward greater awareness will continue.  I highly recommend this movie.  In a time when so many films are full of violence and special effects, this film is a gentle breath of fresh air.",1390089600,,953,4.9

There are so many signs, but few that we pay attention to and allow us to see the truth behind the everyday - Life is short and we have to enjoy it.  Work should be the thing that allows you to do the things you love.  In the summer of 2015, I plan on taking this ""camino.""",1390089600,,567,4.035714285714286

I ordered this movie and have viewed it about 35 times!!

It has a great story. Great actors. Great director [ Emilio ]. It's very touching and inspired me to train this past year to make the pilgrimage of 800 kilometers from St. Jean Pied de Port, France in the Pyrenees through northwestern Spain to Santiago de Composela in Galacia. I will be leaving in September and plan on taking 5 to 6 weeks to walk / backpack this historical path, The Way of St. James.

The sound track is so good that you will want to order this as well.

Throw a party. Invite friends over to watch this very emotional journey of a man who never wanted to out-live his son.

The sign of a GREAT movie versus a good one is that the character(s) evolve throughout the plot to become better people.

This movie has it all.

Way to go ""Amazing-zon""!!!

4876839,4,B005S9ELG2,"Though a bit slow at times in the full development of the story, this film certainly has the feel of going on a journey without really knowing what you are going to see at each turn. The over-riding question in this film, one that is never REALLY answered for any of the characters, is one that can be asked of every ""journey"", not just this pilgrimage: ""Why are you making this journey?""

That is a many-layered question that is returned to repeatedly through some stunning acting (by all the characters), wonderful cinematography, and a powerful screenplay.

I may never actually return to watch this movie again, but the question it poses, over and over again in as many ways possible, is one that continues to echo as I move on (much like Will Smith's Seven Pounds for me).

This isn't a flick necessarily for entertainment or to pass the time. This one requires your attention, whether or not you ever rise to answer the question.",1389398400,,935,4.654545454545454

Played by real life father and son, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez portray two offset characters who struggle to understand each other's path. When tragedy strikes, Tom, the elder, sets out to claim his son's body and ends up, much to his own surprise, embarking upon his son's pilgrimage -- The Camino de Santiago -- a 400 mile trekking trail in Europe. Along the way, Tom is joined by a Canadian (Deborah Kara Unger), a Dutchman (Yorick van Wageningen), and an Irish writer (James Nesbitt), who is suffering from a bout of writer's block. As the physical and psychological challenges of the trail mimic those along the journey of life, we come to understand Tom's world in a very personal way.

He uses Martin Sheen (his father) as an example to illustrate a contrary view of living a life that is rigid, and by plan.

Allow me to chime in with so many others in saying that you won't be disappointed.  This film relies on characters and not special effects or over the top cinematography. I was impressed with the simplicity; it makes no attempts to mask the shortcomings, the struggles, the greatness, and the compassion that is, frankly, universal to all of us.

I found myself smiling for almost the entirety, not because of cheap jokes or concocted scenarios that the characters ""somehow"" find themselves in, but, rather, because of the real and human portrayals.  You can easily imagine being there, the sights, the sounds, the food, the laughter, and even the tears.

I think that, if nothing else, the film does an excellent job of showing that we are never really alone and that we are all really the same in the end.  I applaud Emilio Estevez for the excellence in writing and shooting this film and for his departure from the commonplace Hollywood movie.

Speaking of fathers, his dad Martin Sheen was fabulous. I had heard and read stories about ""The Way"" for many years. After I saw this movie, it sealed the deal for me. I am taking a trip this spring to Spain 2014. To walk "" The Way Of St. James"", The Camino Frances"". Thank you for such an inspirational movie.",1388534400,,450,4.183908045977011

4876975,5,B005S9ELG2,"Great movie about a journey of faith although the father didn't realize it when he began the pilgrimage. He started out with no other goal than to heal his own grief and perhaps ease his guilt about not joining his son initially. Along the way,  he discovered that life's journeys are best traveled with the Lord and friends as companions.",1388534400,,339,4.65

4876978,4,B005S9ELG2,"I picked this movie because it is directed, etc., by Emilio (loved him in Maximum Overdrive!), and because Martin Sheen is IMO a superb actor.  Was not disappointed, but was slightly melancholy through it because of the son's death on his first day of what should have been a life improving journey for him.  It is a very true-to-life telling of the pilgrimage, and seems so worth doing.  If only......

And Joost from Amsterdam was just a truly fun character to watch.

If, for nothing else, watch it for the scenery.  Those were incredible sites.  =)",1388448000,,552,4.6875

What a wonderful journey the writer-director-producer Emilio Estevez takes us on, with his (real-life) father Martin Sheen at the head of the cast.

Tapping into loss, forgiveness, kindness, friendship, sadness, love, and gratitude, the entire production of this film has done an excellent job.

4877008,5,B005S9ELG2,"The movie depicts a very real experience among family members: the misunderstanding that causes a lack of personal association and communication through an individual's lifetime and the all too-late realization of this circumstance, which is commonly triggered by the death of a family member.  It exposes the frailty and the strength of the human spirit as the lives of four people are thrown together for a brief time without any intent or warning.  Very well done.  Good choice for anyone 12 and older.",1388361600,,505,5.0602409638554215

4877021,5,B005S9ELG2,"This movie had a simple, easily followed and moving story w/authentic plot lines.  I love how visually stimulating this movie was as well as the friendships complete w/patience, forgiveness, devotion, love.  This movie represented the best of humanity, religion and existence.  I felt the question posed during Sheen's drunken stupor had much depth, i.e. who is worthy (of standing confidently before God on Judgement Day) anyone, everyone, those who've suffered or perhaps those who've perished in pursuit of these higher, better things.

A low-key, unknown but well worth watching.  Spoiler:  Perhaps, no surprise, Estevez plays very minor rolls as his father remembers him, views him after his death occurs.

My favorite movie regarding common man loving others since I saw ""The Impossible"".",1388102400,,794,5.459016393442623

4877023,5,B005S9ELG2,We watched this because our son was currently walking the Camino and we wanted a better understanding of what that was all about.  The movie succeeded in informing us of the basics as well as some spiritual insights without being overly sappy.  If you Wiki this film you can see it really was a labor of love with great personal meaning for the Sheen / Estevez family.  Highly recommended.,1388102400,,389,4.608695652173913

4877101,4,B005S9ELG2,"Good movie--the people and the scenes reminded me of my 2 years in Europe.  It has a good message about imperfect people on personal journeys (to fill voids, make up for their faults, etc.) along a scenic route.  Although the title of the movie, brief scenes of crucifixes, and ancient cathedrals make it seem like this is a movie about Christianity, it is not.  Christianity is just used as a convenient backdrop to provide a sense of a struggle, not between good and evil, but between the characters and their own deficiencies; and also to give a sense of redemption--as if the characters achieved something through their journey.  Unfortunately, the movie completely misses what Christianity teaches about redemption:  that it is not earned by works.  Rather, it is a free gift from God.

The characters walk up to a post where they throw their pebbles and read something about laying their pebbles at the foot of the cross as a token of their efforts that they might be accepted.  However, the cross is there in the first place because God was paying for our faults--He already put in the effort so that we don't have to.

So it's ironic that the people were offering their good works in hopes of acceptance and redemption, completely missing the point of the cross.  It's not about our efforts, it is about His efforts.  Our efforts are what brought about the problems in the first place.  If we could earn our way to God, then there was no reason for the cross.  Jesus's death on the cross would have been pointless.  But God knows that an imperfect person cannot perfect himself any more than a person covered in mud can clean a room.  Seeing our hopeless condition, God, out of his unfailing love, humbled Himself by becoming a man, and paid the penalty for our sins at the cross so that our slates can be wiped clean.  All we have to do is accept His free gift of salvation.

Instead, the people felt they had to earn their way to God, hoping He will accept their efforts.  In the end, they left no different than when they started.  Anyway--it's a good movie, but the irony of the pilgrims' efforts at the foot of the cross kind of bothered me, and I found myself wishing that those people knew the effort was already made on their behalf and that they no longer have to be slaves to their faults, but that they can be free because Jesus died on the cross for their sins and resurrected from the dead, breaking the bondage of sin and death, so that whoever believes in him will have freedom from sin and eternal life.",1386979200,,2527,4.514285714285714

The story is not overly developed and at times is a little thin, but the pace is consistently moving towards a goal, and the ending is pleasantly positive.

Thru-hiking, whether you're in France, Spain, on the Appalachian Trail, or anywhere, is a deeply personal experience. The Way is one of the best films I've seen that expresses this. Martin Sheen's character, a father who is completing the trail (pilgrimage) for his son who died on the trail, meets and befriends other thru-hikers. I love how the director emphasizes the individual's journey, by taking the time with each person at the trail's end, as well as showing that it isn't the journey's end. The scenery is spectacular, well casted, and great acting.. Unless I get a robo-wheelchair, or mechanical legs, my hiking days are over, but it's nice to remember what it felt like.

4877166,5,B005S9ELG2,"Few storytellers in the visual medium of feature films dare to rely upon raw, vast images of beautiful sites, interspersed with silence, & moments that ebb into crescendos.  In crossing the Pyrenees and Basque country, then winding ""the way"" through northern Spain to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela their pilgrimages, like life, are personal ones, And each must experience it, to find their salvation, and accept their penance.

It reminds me of a great line I once borrowed from a writer  ""We're not humans having a spiritual experience, but rather spiritual beings having a human experience.""  This statement is more profound the more one contemplates it. For we think because we are made of the flesh, we are simply flesh.  This story shows how these four flawed humans, start out on a pilgrimage, looking to resolve, forgive or be absolved of demons that trouble their lives, & hold their spirits hostage.

Only when they can escape their trite human folly, do the facades of the four hikers melt away.  Only then, do their spiritual selves become revealed, discovered & eventually, explored on their road to redemption.  We need more of these character driven films, which drive plots, versus the other way around.

Watch ""The Way"" with a friend, discuss it, share it with someone you love.  Perhaps, someone battling an inner demon might tag along on this pilgrimage, to begin one of their own.  A pilgrimage that for most, is a luxury of time/expense few of us can afford.  Yet, a fewer of us CAN NOT afford to miss.

The Camino de Santiago was not new to me, but I never really thought seriously about walking it until I saw this movie.  I bought the DVD and started showing it to others.  Very quickly 6 other people decided they would like to walk the camino also.  We didn't have time to do the Camino Francais that is depicted in the movie (it takes 5 to 6 weeks), so we decided to do the Portuguese Camino that is ""only"" 150 miles long.  The movie is a fairly accurate depiction of the Camino.  We met wonderful people from all over and saw many beautiful things.  We ate ternero and drank good Rioja wine.  People really do say ""buen camino"" all the time, and the Portuguese and Spanish people were kind and helpful.  Finally arriving at the cathedral in Santiago after the long walk is a really moving experience.  We even went to mass and they swung the incense burner!  One wrong thing really stands out in the movie--DON'T try doing the Camino without physical preparation like Martin Sheen did.

It is probably too late for us, with arthritic knees, to do this physically anymore. But this video is the next best thing. We have always been interested in the Camino and found this video very inspirational. In addition, the commentary is as great as the movie. Some may find it slow, so if you are looking for lots of action, this may not be your cup of tea. The subtle growth of the realization that each of the various characters has their own reasons for being a pilgrim, and that nothing here is by accident, is very symbolic.  Even if you don't plan on a physical pilgrimage of self discovery, it is meaningful as a metaphor for our spiritual life journey.  Not coincidentally, shortly after seeing this video, I discovered that an old friend was doing the Camino, and she regularly sent posts on Facebook to update us on her pilgrimage.

4877336,2,B005S9ELG2,"This seemed to be an excellent idea for a movie.  I give it a star for the scenery and a star for the acting.  It loses three stars for the lack of development of the characters, a paucity of plot, and poor resolution of the issues faced by the characters.  I grew tired of Martin Sheen's angry striding away and never developed any liking for any of the characters in the movie as they didn't seem to care about solving their own problems other than finding a place to sleep and eat along the trail.

It would have been a better movie with at least a little history of the characters before they met on the trail and much better if Martin Sheen had done more than angrily march down the road.  Why was Jack the Irish character who called churches ""Temples of Tears"" brought to sobbing by the end of the movie in the cathedral? There is absolutely no clue in the film for that.

This is a spectacular area of great scenic and historical significance which was only shown in superficial detail.  How about another attempt at this and do it right next time.",1382400000,,1055,4.3520408163265305

From the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela, I laughed and cried with this man in his grim determination to perform his pilgrim duty ""correctly."" Not one scene struck a false note, not one interchange played for schlock or schmaltz. An analogy with an Oz-type road trip can be made, but it's subtle. It occurred to me only after the 2nd viewing (but before hearing Estevez' comments in Special Features, also excellent.) When the intrepid quartet reaches the cathedral, entering in silence, each having his or her personal epiphany - as the gigantic censer (Botafumiero) swings through the space - I recall my own intense experience there in May 2011, and weep a flood of tears.

Like Dorothy, it's a trip he didn't expect to take, but he realizes it's the only way to really return home.  I hope Emilio Estevez will bring us more films like this.  I loved it!  I bought it!",1378684800,,314,4.271186440677966
4877480,3,B005S9ELG2,"Being a trekker and hiker, I loved the plot of this movie: a successful US doctor/ophthalmologist decides to trek 800 miles from France to Spain after his son dies tragically just one day into the same quest. The combination of a father attempting to connect with his late son by finishing the journey his son never got to complete, along with beautiful outdoor scenery and the quirky characters and lessons they impart along the way had the makings of a great movie, but everything fell flat for me due to the bad acting of the main character and his three sidekicks on the trail.

Martin Sheen is mostly expressionless, whether he's viewing his son's dead body, sprinkling his son's remains at various stops along the trail or doing anything else. Was it perhaps no accident that the director chose not to show Sheen's face when he learns through a phone call on the golf course that his son has died? All you see is Sheen taking the call, and then before you know it, he's hijacked his golfing buddies' cart and is taking off. He says very little, emotes even less. One has to be willing to project and believe that this is a man with a well of deep feelings and thoughts, because he certainly never shows it. The character of each of his companions on the trail....a Dutch man trying to lose weight, an Irish author and an angry Canadian woman, is equally disappointing, as they are never really developed enough to pique one's interest.

If you are, inexplicably, a Martin Sheen fan, you'll probably like the movie.",1378598400,,1520,4.625925925925926

Seeing his son along the trip is a bonus to the story being told.  Reminds one of their own father who wants you to be successful his way and not the way you want.

It is truly a pilgrimage in love and spirituality.  Everybody can learn a valuable lesson from this movie.  Spain is beautiful and the churches are fantastic.  The swinging of the Monstrance is breath taking.  What a tribute to a story about a father and a son and along the way they make valuable friends and learn valuable lessons about people and God.  I have watched this many times and I intend to walk the El Camino de Santiago soon.  This movie incited that in me and I am 74 years old but I will do this.,1378425600,,672,4.588235294117647

As a companion READ, look to Paulo Cohelo's The Pilgrimage, about the same route. BUT be certain to follow it up with the book Cohelo wrote the following year, The Alchemist, about life's pilgrimage. Some high school teachers use it in their unit on understanding Islam? even though it is set is Spain, is not about the Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah, nor is it explicitly about Islam. YET it is very Sufi Islam and can be read in the light of all mystical traditions.
Likewise, this film can be watched and experienced in the same way. . . helping us to see all our human connections, and our desire to make our own personal connections to God/Allah/Creator/Universe. . .whatever word helps you make that connection.

The Way -El Camino de Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain - is in fact a 400 mile pilgrimage that has been walked since medieval times and continues to draw many pilgrims even today. The movie is engaging and easy to follow. A father receives a phone call from France telling him his estranged son has died on the first leg of the Way. The father immediately goes there to get his remains and possessions in the form of a backpack for walking the Way of St James. Once there he is moved (impelled?) to walk the Way in memory of his lost son, scattering his ashes along the way. He meets many fellow pilgrims and has many interesting encounters. The movie is a pleasure to watch and follow and leaves one with a good feeling and a special surprising postscript at the very end.

St James, whose body is believed entombed in the Cathedral goal of the journey, was one of the 12 apostles of Jesus and thus walking the Way was a profound spiritual religious experience for pilgrims all through the years. The movie unfortunately fails to illustrate that spiritual nature of The Way. Much as I enjoyed the film, I was quite disappointed about this - especially in comparison to our friend's blog record of the journey - and thus gave it only a four star rating. If you watch and enjoy the film you may wish search further for additional information about the true nature of the pilgrimage.",1374537600,,1613,4.482993197278912

4877707,4,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is an enjoyable walk through the difficult relationship between fathers and sons.
When Tom (Martin Sheen) learns that his son Daniel (Estevez) died along the 'camino de Compostela', he decides to fly to Eu from the States to retrieve the body, but once there he steps into Daniel's shoes and undertakes the 800km long pilgrimage. This is initially to honor his son's memory and to scatter his ashes along the stops of the camino, but ultimately it will serve to understand himself in a deeper way.
The young man's last adventure gives life to the older character, which in a sense will owe to his son this gained freedom. The title of my review is a quote, a phrase Tom says to his secretary once he learns that Daniel is somewhere in Eu without a working phone. I thought it was paramount, since in order to be on his son's terms, the man will lose his professional schedule and eventually will find his path to happiness.
Here is at play a generationally inverted concept that touches the heart and is well rendered.
Emilio Estevez does quite a good job, and I enjoyed the nostalgic fragments where Tom sees him among the peregrinos in different moments of his journey.
Not worth 5 stars imo because it can be felt a bit naive and a bit slow at times, but definitely a good movie worth watching.",1373932800,,1305,4.533898305084746

That journey is not always paved by self serving means- like in Eat, Pray and Love. Rather The Way realistically chronicles four pilgrims journey down the De Camino with rich  and dynamic characterization. The scenic journey is a history and geography lesson that makes the lofty real.  Shadowed by the complexities of a father / son relationship, this story shows how all human relationships are building blocks to our own self awareness. Wonderful work to Estevez's pictorial chilling reminder that it is the journey, not the destinations that defines our own sense of reconciliation, peace and internal forgiveness.

This movie has introduced the U.S. to a 1200 year old cultural experience of Europe that has been relatively unknown in America until this film.  It engaged me on so many levels..... father, son, employee, dreamer, etc.  I was incredibly moved by this film but knew I was completely biased because I had walked El Camino de Santiago several years ago.  The emotional and spiritual impact of that experience clouded all that I was watching so it was a joy to have so many friends point to that film as one of their favorite recent films.  There are a lot of strong masculine thoughts and attitudes being projected in this film but I would recommend the film only if you are interested in a more internal experience as compared to being entertained by the non stop action of many current films.

I anticipated this film even before I watched it, and enjoyed every moment; it's poignant, sad, introspective and very funny in parts too. A good film or anything that is created from nothing should at the least make you think, and at best make you wonder; the best pieces of art should at least make you think. It doesn't necessarily mean that that which is artistic shouldn't make someone a lot of money either, as I think the creative process can go hand in hand with the making of money, just that we hope that something can be lasting, like a great film noir from the 40's or 50's or a Hendrix tune or a painting from Vincent Van Gogh.

So, the film; it is about a man who finds that his son has died on the El camino de Santiago, the way of Saint James, and of course he is shocked and grief-stricken, goes to Spain to sort things out, and then embarks on the trail himself. Along the way, he meets other people, just as individualistic and quirky as he is; an Irish travel writer, a slightly fat Dutchman and a slightly hard-bitten Canadian woman. They walk most the way and share laughs and adventures and secrets on the way. I'm not big on metaphors or symbolism, but I think that the El camino de Santiago represents all our paths we take in life, a path that leads us who knows where, where we experience joy, pain, laughs, tears and hopefully a sense of fulfilment and redemption when we reach our goal; life isn't just a destination it is definitely a journey too. We all know that the end of the journey is death, our own mortality, so perhaps we should learn to enjoy the journey a little more and stop worrying.

I've got friends in Spain, one particular friend, well, truth to tell she is Catalonian and never tell someone from Catalonia they are Spanish! Anyway, Spain is beautifully shown off in all its splendour and it is a beautiful country all told; I've visited Barcelona and it's my favourite city with good restaurants and nice people and a good not over-hot climate being northern Spain.

I recommend this film highly as not your typical Hollywood blockbuster but one that you will like and makes you think and one which you will want to view again. And the big question? YES, I definitely want one day, when I make my fortune, to walk the whole El camino de Santiago; perhaps on my own or with a friend or two. It's another dream of mine.",1370390400,2,2683,4.4471544715447155

Once there he decides to take his son's ashes with him while he walks the path on his son's behalf. ""The Way"" tells the story of Tom's journey, the fellow pilgrims he meets, and how they each change along the path.

The second time for me was a real blessing as I could more fully come to understand each of the characters and their respective struggles. It was easier then to have a decent measure of solidarity with their hearts. I especially loved the scenes with Ismail and Tom and how the issues which brought them together in the first place were resolved. I also really marvelled at the final few moments in the story where they come to a really special place on the Spanish coast-line and how this ties in well culturally speaking with the traditional narrative of who St James actually was. I also loved the bit where they arrived at the monastery and thought the way in which the monks welcomed the pilgrims was something really special.

4877955,3,B005S9ELG2,"After some gentle urging from some of my JayFlix colleagues, I finally picked up a DVD of this expertly targeted movie from the library and viewed it. I say expertly targeted because it clearly speaks to a huge number of people who appreciate the redemption of an estranged father who reluctantly follows a path chosen by his (deceased) son.

Adapting the book by Jack Hitt, ""Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route Into Spain,"" Emilio Estevez has crafted a screenplay that features his father Martin Sheen as the modern-day pilgrim who takes his son's ashes along ""El camino de Santiago,"" in northern Spain. Also directed by Mr. Estevez, this satisfying little gem is sweet, funny and inspiring. It has been nominated for numerous awards.

We see:
  * Martin Sheen (""Anger Management"" with his son Charlie Sheen) is a California ophthalmologist who decides on the spur of the moment to complete the trek his son had begun. Perhaps he will come to understand him a little better.
  * Emilio Estevez (lots of TV) in a few flashbacks plays the deceased son.
  * Deborah Kara Unger (""Crash"") is a Canadian peregrina whose sole purpose for this pilgrimage to quit smoking.
  * Yorick van Wageninger (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" 2011) is a gregarious, pudgy fellow from the Netherlands. He wants to lose weight so he can fit into his old suit.
  * James Nesbitt (""Coriolanus"") is an Irish author suffering from writer's block.

As time passes and the miles accumulate, a tentative foursome has formed. We see other peregrinos (pilgrims) and appreciate the warmth and hospitality extended by the Basques and Spaniards along the way. I couldn't help but notice the similarity to Canterbury Tales, and wonder where and how they kept themselves clean, how they adjusted to the cramped hostels in which they slept and the unusual food they ate. I very much enjoyed their reaction at one point, when they were given the luxury of individual hotel rooms.

Treat yourself to a scenic stroll through an interesting countryside with occasional stops at way stations, hostels and cathedrals. Amazon has the DVD and it DOES have closed captions!",1366329600,,2151,4.922437673130194

It is the amazing story of a father making the famous Way of St. James pilgrimmage through France and Spain for his only son, who died while making the trip himself. This movie is so moving because it could be about anyone. At it's heart, it is a movie about finding out what is really important in life. Things such as careers, money, prestige, and material goods, are not really what matter. Life is a constant journey, and finding love, joy, peace, (all of the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit) and living life well with the ones you love along the way, are what really matter.

4878004,5,B005S9ELG2,"This movie either speaks to you, or it doesn't.

For those who want digital effects, complicated twists and fast action - you will be sorely disappointed.  This movie fails miserably at all of those.  What it succeeds at - is taking you on a beautiful journey, in a very simple, eloquent and touching fashion.

I am very impressed with Emilio Estevez.  He managed to bring together a simple poignant story, the perfect cast, stunning visuals, beautiful music, and the one thing Hollywood seems to lack these days - the ability to make an emotional connection through a story.

The entire cast delivers excellent, well-defined, yet subtle performances.  Martin Sheen, (and I could not picture anyone else in this role) in particular, captures the ""father of few words who can't express emotions"" in a very powerful fashion.  I read that Sheen had suggested Michael Douglas or Mel Gibson for the role of the father, and all I can say is, thank goodness Emilio told his father that it was written with him in mind.  Sheen is spot-on, and the father-son collaboration makes it all the more powerful.

Each cast member is excellent, and very adept at pulling you into the story.  The final, fantastic cast member is The Camino itself.  Absolutely breathtaking, it is beautifully captured in the cinematography and editing.  The music as well, is tasteful, subtle and perfect for this film.  I enjoyed it so much I ended up downloading the soundtrack.

This movie, very much like walking The Camino, should be savored.  The highest compliment that I can pay Emilio Estevez, is that after watching it 6 times on Netflix, I still felt the need to purchase the DVD.  It just speaks to me!  There are those who always wait for something dramatic to happen in a film, yet this movie contains such charm in the simple details.  Savor, pay attention to the subtleties, and it will touch your heart.  It may even, like me, speak to you in a way that spurs you to embark on a pilgrimage of your own.",1364688000,,1984,4.712209302325581
4878005,5,B005S9ELG2,"This is not your typical movie.  Not everyone will like it. My brother was bored by it.
I think one review highlighted about the pilgrims traveling for ""mundane"" reasons misses the point.
This film is about a journey on more than one level.  I enjoyed some of the discussions the characters had about the pilgrimage.  This is worth the time.  If you are someone who either has done independent travel or hope to, then you should like this.  It gives you the experience that you would have if you took a trip with a backpack in Europe.",1364601600,,534,4.463917525773196
4878016,5,B005S9ELG2,"There are some films that aren't masterpieces, but still strike a deeply resonant chord with viewers. For me, ""The Way"" is just such a film. Small, sincere, honest, it doesn't strive for some magnificent epiphany or all-knowing message. Instead, it offers a protagonist not unlike many of us, set in his ways, comfortable enough in them, who must suddenly face the shattering of his life & begin trying to cope with it.

In this case, Martin Sheen delivers a quietly powerful performance as Tom Avery, who must cope with the death of his estranged son Daniel, who was beginning the long pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago. Unable to put into words the depth & complexity of his anguished emotions, he chooses to complete the pilgrimage for his son ... and of course for himself. So he sets out, determined to reach his destination as swiftly as possible & find some sort of closure.

""Closure"" -- that's an overused word these days, almost a glib & arbitrary cutoff point imposed by a society intent on ""moving forward"" at all costs. In a way, it's a means of avoiding any in-depth contemplation & exploration. That's what makes this film so honest & heartfelt: it's not about closure, it's about opening up. In fact, Tom Avery's problem is that his whole life has become closed, sealed off; he's so goal-oriented that he can't see the beauty & wonder of the journey itself.

But as he continues on the pilgrimage & unwillingly finds himself gaining three very different companions, Tom does begin to open up. As I said, there's no single shattering epiphany; it's more of an organic growth, a slow realization that there is indeed far more to life than simply getting there. If it's not explicitly a religious theme, it's definitely a spiritual one. I was reminded of Thomas Merton's classic volume ""Mystics and Zen Masters"" while watching, in that the film is much more about direct & immediate experience than any particular dogma or program. As Teresa of Avila once wrote, ""Every day on the road to God is God."" And this is just as true for an atheist like myself as it is for a religious believer -- the journey is what matters, and the goal is simply a marker.

I don't want to make this sound too ponderous & weighty. While there's plenty of substance here, writer-director Emilio Estevez never confuses what's genuinely meaningful with the glumly portentous or heavy-handed piety. There's a lot of humor, joie de vivre, and sheer beauty here, both in the gorgeous landscapes & in the evolving friendship of the four travelers. Everything is a reminder that each moment of life is both fleeting & precious, not to be wasted. For those of us who find our lives being eaten away by the minutia of the everyday, which we've come to take for granted as reality, this is something we desperately need to remember!

And is anyone changed by the end of the film? Perhaps not so much changed as more truly themselves, far more knowledgeable & accepting of who they are, flaws & all. The final scene makes it clear that the journey never really ends, not for those who have broken through the walls of the mundane world that we've been taught is so important. Opening up, not closure -- most highly recommended!",1364601600,3,3211,4.7064056939501775

Great story line, great acting. This is a must see!!!",1364428800,,363,4.59375
4878019,4,B005S9ELG2,"This movie may improve with another viewing...  What I don't like about it is basically tied up with Martin Sheen's performance.  His character works, for the most part, but he never quite seems to ""get it"".  At several points in the film I found myself thinking ""There, now he finally realizes that it's the Journey, not the Destination"".  And then, a few minutes later, as he stalks off ahead, Mr. Efficient American On A Mission, you realize, no, he doesn't get it.  One character puts it best when she wonders if he'll ever ""stop and smell the roses"".  It reminds me of the members of the party that ""discovered"" Yosemite;  so intent were they on getting in, and getting out, one later remarked ""if we'd known how famous it would become, we would have paid attention"".

At the end of the movie he appears to be in Morocco, in a city that looks like a restored original set from ""Casablanca"", and he's still just a city guy out to get somewhere up ahead, not to smell the roses along the road.

But, don't let that discourage you. Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez, his son, play a father and son with differing views of life;  the father makes his way as a successful California opthamologist and the son, growing up in the good life---it's not clear he has his own money---prefers traveling, treking across the world to find his way.  Nice work if you can get it, and don't die in the Pyranees (or going over Yosemite Falls, for that matter...)  So, after refusing his son's invitation to join him on this famous pilgrimage, he ends up having to go anyway, to reclaim his body, and seeing how much of the hike was left, decides to cremate his son's remains, and make the pilgrimage, himself, with his son's ashes.  It's in the early scenes, as Martin Sheen comes to terms with his loss, and FINALLY decides to do the right thing, by making the trek, that the film is at it's most poignant.  After that, it lightens up.

The Irish writer remains irritating to the end, but I suppose it's better than having the stereotypical ""drunk Aussie"" drinking Fosters everywhere.  Mr. Sheen's character picks up an entourage of sorts;  a very disagreeable lot at first, save for the comical but ultimately useful Dutchman who's walking to lose weight, and who carries enough drugs to get himself locked up for a century;  a very angry Canadian (for a change), and the aforementioned Irish writer.

For those afraid of such things, relax:  There's only one campfire discussion that is the least bit philosophical, relating in this case to what makes for a ""genuine"" pilgrim, and what degree of luxury would ruin the authenticity.  Like most such films these days, this is meant to be entertaining, and that's what it is;  thinking, unfortunately, is once again optional.

So, yes, while Martin Sheen isn't quite convincing as a trekker---too focused on the destination and never seeming to realize the importance of the journey---that's but a slight drag on an otherwise light entertainment set in a gorgeous country-scape.",1364428800,,3013,4.7298850574712645

4878037,4,B005S9ELG2,"The movie was produced & directed by Martin Sheen's son (Emilio Estevez) who unfortunately had a very brief part in the beginning,
As Martin starts and undertakes his trek (El camino de Santiago) he meets and befriends several characters which adds some entertainment and uniqueness to the movie which keeps it from getting to boring.  The small villages and rest stops along the way although a nice part of the movie, I wish more time would have been spent to introduce the characters at the stops more, but I guess due to the fact the trekers arrived late and rose early, not too much time for village character development.  There were a couple of scenes where this did happened and gave a good perspective on the folks who lived in the villages and ran the ""guest houses"" and those who were on the trek.

However, even though he has company along the way, the trek is a very personal matter for him and he never loses sight of the purpose for his journey.

The movie is shot in some very very beautiful places, including unique villages and stunning landscapes. The characters alone the journey are great and funny and sometimes even insightful. I do think that the movie is a bit too long. There are many montages that are almost identical (walking and traveling through beautiful areas) and a lot of the story can be condensed. However, with such a long trek, it might be fitting that the movie is long. I also think that the movie romanticizes the trek. Such a trek is pretty difficult involves a lot more than is shown in this movie.

Is there ""The one""? What am I meant to do or be? Do I have regrets? I suppose this is quite the existential tall order but these are the questions that drive us and once we are older and more settled I find myself loving books like Elizabeth's and movies like The Wat because they bring me back to the adventure of THE SEARCH! If you have ever had any questions about what is next in your life, the Camino as a personal journey, or know of a person who is beginning or beginning again their own adventure into the big wide world then this book is perfect! The Trail's wit and thoughtfulness reminds me of the power of words, their deep affect on us, and their ability to unearth those reminders that the adventure of life both allows us to fall and to soar. It's the adventure that exists in all of us today and that I encounter while reading The Trail. If you loved The Way continue to The Trail! :)

4878110,5,B005S9ELG2,"Tom (Martin Sheen) is pulled from work and has to go to France to recover the body of his estranged son Daneil ( Emilio Estevez) who had died while attempting the ""El camino de Santiago,"" pilgrimage - an 800 kilometre pilgrimage between the French Pyrenees and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Tom is not a religious man but decides to take the pilgrimage himself.
This is a father / son drama and Emilio Estevez the real life son of Martin Sheen directs full of small touches and a lot of warmth. There are occasional conversations between father and son that we are privy to- and we know that they were at odds with each other.
The pilgrimage brings together an assortment of companions who are opposites,the abused (Debra Kara Unger), the beefy Dutchman ( Yorick Wageningen and a writer ( Nesbitt), however each other warm to each other during the course of the journey. The journey itself is so amazing and picturesque- the landscape gorgeous and the food amazing. Highly recommended.

Like all movies it sugarcoats the trip and does not show the real challenge and pain that is the Camino. Having said this, Sheen and Estevez have cultural ties with Spain and the Camino is a great way to showcase a fascinating aspect. The film was shot on the Camino and the father/son link helps the plot have a 'real' aspect to it. I saw it at the cinema and wanted to own a copy, so I suppose that reinforces my opinion.

4878173,5,B005S9ELG2,"First, I'll admit: though I got this movie last year, it took me several months to get the courage to watch it. Why? I wasn't sure why. Still not sure. Nonetheless, I've seen it and love it!
When an eye doctor gets news that his son, while on a life journey, has died during a storm, the eye doctor, Thomas Avery, goes out to honor his late son's journey. What he never expects is to make the journey with several others with unique backstories that will help him in ways he never imagined possible.
Many may remember Emilio Estevez from films like The Breakfast Club, The Mighty Ducks, Maximum Overdrive, and Repo Man, but in this, he takes an entirely different direction (pun intended) and, thourhgout most of the film, appears as a hallucination of his father's grief. And, as the multiple hallucinations, never once speaks, yet the multiple times he's seen always have a beautiful meaning the time and place they appear. The couple times he's seen alive also have great value, but not quite as much substance as when he's a vision (I think that was intentional for sentimental value).
The people Thomas Avery meets along the Way (Camino de Santiago) are a comic relief of a man that needs to lose weight before his brother's wedding, a woman with a smoking habit and a shocking secret that explains why she's so critical about everything, and an Irish writer trying to find inspiration and failing big-time until he meets the unlikely trio. Every single one of them creates as unique a group for a journey as L. Frank Baum made for The Wizard of Oz, and it is a beautiful, even if faulty, friendship none had expected to make.
But it's not only the people that make the film what it is. There's also the natural beauty of the scenery everywhere they go (I'll admit, I get bored of watching movies with a strictly American setting, so it's a nice breather to occassionally watch a movie like this). But, more important to the story itself is not the scenery, per se, but the interactions with all the other groups of people they meet. Some, while not having as much screen time as the four-person group, present a personal beauty to the Thomas Avery's emotional scenes, including a Catholic Father with a scar that covers up and a handful of rosary beads, as well as a young Gypsy boy who takes Thomas' son's backpack, which sets up a profound meeting and talk with the boy's father about the importance of family and life with a great quote at the end (""It's not about religion. Not at all."")
In ways, I felt connected to different characters for different reasons, even if not for the exact same reason in the exact same way, so it wasn't only Thomas Avery who came out of the journey different.
Oh, and can't forget the humor throughout the movie. The film direction does an excellent job at appropriately separating the humor from the poignant drama, which felt entirely necessary in this trip of a lifetime.
A lot of films that end up being ""inspirational"" tend to be marketed as ""Christian,"" which tends to turn people off. It's not fo that reason that I wouldn't call this film Christian, but it really is inspirational. It doesn't go too fast for characterization, nor goes too slow to indulge in the natural scenery, it goes a steady-enough pace for it to be completely impacting at the right moments, shocking also at the right moments, but doesn't stray into the all-too-familiar territory of an evangelical film trying to proselytize people to a religious institution (even if Martin Sheen is a devout Catholic), rather, it seems that the film's intention is to help people through the troubles of life and help them known there are others out there who need help and friends in their journey (or, pilgrimage of life, if you would). Due to the unique backgrounds of each character (an American, an Irish, a Canadian, and a Dutch), you get to see the world very differently, funny arguments about how each culture sees history differently, and not only from the main characters, but the ""random"" people they meet, some once, some a little more.
Regardless of each person's faith or lack of faith, this was definitely the most inspirational film released last year I've seen that had nothing to do with the Bible, surprisingly enough, and that may very well be a good thing (as a self-proclaiming Christian, indie Christians films, to me, get to be an irritant with the formulas they use, none of which this film uses).
This film uses an inspirational structure all its unique own, and that's why I loved it.",1358985600,,4522,4.675031367628607
4878174,5,B005S9ELG2,"Being a huge fan of the Sheen family, I was so excited to see that Emilio and Mr. Sheen made a movie together.  I couldn't wait for the DVD to come in the mail.  I LOVED this movie!  The performances are excellent and touching.

There are times when life throws us a curve and our world is turned upside down.  Mr. Sheen plays a father who goes to France to deal with the loss of his son who died while walking the El Camino de Santiago.  His intention was just to collect his son's things, but instead, he begins to learn some things about his son and how passionate he was about walking the El Camino.  Rather than go home, he decides to finish the walk for his son and begins a soul searching journey of a lifetime.

On the way, he meets a variety of colorful characters and learns what true friendship is all about.  He also goes within to discover who he really is and what the really important things are in life.  As the back of the DVD says, he ""discovers the difference between the life we live and the life we choose.""

(I actually bought this film months ago, but just getting around to writing the review)

This movie is amazing! I am biased because I am a huge fan of Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen but every time they come together to make a movie, it becomes the most incredible thing ever!
I loved watching this movie and I watched it with my mum and we were both in awe of the Camino De Santiago. I think it had the same affect that it had on everyone else who had seen this movie and that was, ""I want to go walk the Camino De Santiago!""

The movie was touching and moving and Martin Sheen really put his heart into this role. He played a guy that isn't very likable and he found away, with Emilio Estevez, to make the audience see a part of Tom, the character, likable and even have the audience relate to him on certain levels.

I recommend everyone see this movie, because it has the most amazing scenery from the Camino De Santiago and the storyline is wonderful and there is no target audience, so 4 year olds to 114 year olds can watch it and appreciate it all the same. I have recommended it to so many people and they loved it.",1355788800,,1255,4.110204081632653

4878364,5,B005S9ELG2,"The story many know, a son and father, Tom,  who want different things of the son's life.  They grow apart, and the emptiness ensues.  The son decides to go on Camino de Santiago in Spain, a journey many take.  Tragedy occurs; the son has died on the trip, and the father is left with what was never said.  And now it becomes the father who will complete the journey, finding more about himself and others that he missed along his way in life.
There are some topics that can be used as springboards with teens, self-image vs society's image of self. There is smoking and drinking (I mean they are in Europe!), drug use (one traveler is carrying marijuana and other assorted drugs), and of course the topic of a parent burying their child.  There is no violence or heavy cursing, so it can be viewed with the family, but I would limit it to teens and parents, PG-13 in this case is the maturity of the topic and how it's dealt with among the characters.

Well done, well written characters, and sheds light on a journey many make in life. Written by Emilio Estevez for his father.  Martin Sheen, who's life journey is another story to read about, plays Tom.  I'm sure he brought some of his own experiences as a father of two men who strayed away from.... well, sometimes reality in general.
By the way, ""The Way of St. James"" is a journey many pilgrims make every year.

I just bought a new 60 inch tv and I thought the scenery on the trailer looked amazing.  So I bought it thinking it would look good on my new tv.  Well I was not disappointed!  The scenery in this movie is amazing.  However I thought the movie was a much better movie than what some of the reviews were saying.  It is a 2 hour movie and when it ended I was wishing that it was longer.  This is a must see movie in my opinion.  Martin Sheen does an outstanding job in this one.

I am a Catholic and knew something about pilgrimages but I didn't realize that the old pilgrim roads were still used.  Although people of all stripes walk the Camino, not all are interested in a religious experience.  I have since purchased a number of books that have been written as tour guides with maps, and that have reflected the ancient ""Codex Calixtinus"" which was the original document describing the story of how the body of St James came to be interred in Spain.  The ""Codex"" also describes the pilgrim road, the chuches and refugios open to pilgrims.  The movie is a visual journey with characters whose stories are all different.

4878522,3,B005S9ELG2,"Saw this dvd at the local library the week after I watched the Rick Steves' Travels Through Europe episode on the Compostela, and thought I'd give it a try. The plot is very simple; a grieving father decides to complete his dead son's journey along the Way of St. James to northwest Spain. The reviewer(s) who mentioned the Canterbury Tales are right in the simularities. It is earnest, predictable, and deliberately paced and reminded me of the old Christopher Hour on Sunday morning television of so many years ago. The photography and scenery are really outstanding and almost reason enough to watch. Martin Sheen overacted a bit for my taste but the cast of lesser known performers is first rate and the message might have been lost with big names in the other roles. The film interspirses dialogue and travel (ie., walking the trail) scenes to move the story along. When the characters are not interacting, the scenery captures the viewers attention. Most surprisingly to this cynic, it kept my interest the whole way through. It's not  worth paying $15 to see at a theater but definitly worth watching. Debated my rating but chose the lower number for it's predictablity but I can understand why so many viewers gave it higher marks",1350691200,,1238,4.839622641509434

4878565,4,B005S9ELG2,"A father is continuously disappointed and angered by his only son, by who he is and by his efforts to find his way, to the point where the son might as well confront him with something along the lines of, ""Hey Dad, you're an eye doctor.  You make a living by helping others to see more clearly.  How about looking at yourself, inward.  Why are you so angry with me?  Where is this anger coming from?  Nothing I do seems to please you.  What have I done to you?  I'm hurt and confused.  You're a smart man.  Can you please help me understand?""  The son decides to go on a pilgrimage to find some answers, but shortly after beginning it, he, I suspect, hears that voice inside, ""Who do you think you are?  You're not good enough.""  To escape from the intensity of the voice, he goes off the trail risking his life.  Aside from the fact that he is an only child, why is this voice so powerful?  One possibility for consideration comes from psychology, ""Those of the older generation, for their part, are likewise motivated by their unconscious wishes, which stem from their own childhood, instinctual wishes.  For example, ... a member of the older generation may unconsciously equate the younger generation (his 'children') with his own parents, who are now in reality aged or deceased, but who, in his unconscious fantasy, are reincarnated in the new generation."" (pg 224 from An Elementary Textbook of Psychoanalysis by Charles Brenner)  In other words, in some cases, to put it bluntly, the son becomes the mother to the father and try as the father might, he cannot resolve his issues with his mother by scapegoating his son.  The other three travelers seem to have unresolved father issues as well, but metaphorically speaking, seem to represent Tom's developing sides (emotional, openness etc).  The movie brought up the issue of whether or not technology is of help or hindrance to being a seeker.  Perhaps asking why bringing an ipod is part of the process?  I got the impression that the movie left it open regarding the degree in which the travelers became transformed as a thought-provoking tool, thus making this film a part of the journey.",1349568000,,2150,4.697860962566845

4878605,5,B005S9ELG2,"First of all, this is not a movie about religion, even if the pilgrims are back-sliding Catholics. Following a path that has been traveled for a thousand years, four pilgrims hike along the Pyrenees Mountains and Basque country on an 800 km trek to the tomb of Saint James in the town of Santiago de Compostela.

The movie is about finding meaning in life, even after the worst tragedies (Martin Sheen's son has died while on the pilgrimage and Martin completes it, leaving bits of his son's ashes along the way). The fact that the characters are all Catholics is really not that important. The same story could have been told about Hindus making a pilgrimage.

This is a beautiful movie filled with likable characters, and it will have you hoping that they will all succeed in their quest of self-discovery and reconciling themselves to the realities of their lives.

For me, at least, the ancient architecture was a reminder of what western European civilization owes Spain. In 1492, the same year that Columbus discovered the New World, Queen Isabella expelled the Moors from Spain, leaving Europe in the hands of the Christians, rather than the Muslims. Of course, it was brutal and bloody (they also expelled the Jews). But--and this is important--many Muslims and Jews simply converted to Christianity so they could stay. Had history not resolved itself in this way, the New World might have been conquered by Muslims, rather than Catholics. Now that would be a different world.",1348876800,2,1484,4.904382470119522

I was instantly caught up in it. The music, the story. The prickly and poignant characters. I had intended to watch the second half of it the next morning in order to get some sleep, but that didn't happen because I forgot that I was in a dorm room in Chicago. I was in a different place while watching this movie. I was crying, thinking how beautiful it was.

So as you can see I loved this movie, its story, its messages, its emotions, its characters. It really moved me. And it's opened my eyes to a host of new dreams to undertake in this life.

4878614,3,B005S9ELG2,"Actually, my title relates to a couple of interviews with Martin Sheen that I watched on YouTube. In the movie, he follows the script to portray the grieving father scattering his son's ashes along the Camino, completing his son's journey for him. The walk becomes a catharsis and reawakening for the father, far transcending what he had begun as a spartan obligation. The story line added another dimension to the significance of this thousand year old pilgrimage, but some of the writing came up short for me. While important to the father's character transformation, the odd assortment of people he meets along the way are not entirely credible. The lone woman is unbelievably abrasive at their first meeting and doesn't get much better.

First off, I don't know why the Martin Sheen character is so pissed off.  Of course it has to do with his son dying and him obviously making the trek as an appeasement to his son, or trying to understand him, but there is something missing.  It would have also been much better if Sheen was an executive as opposed to an mere opthalmologist.  There would have been a better contrasting of worlds.  The ending I also found to be not climactic, although I've seen at least one person say they loved the film, so I guess it would have meant something for them.",1347580800,,708,4.246268656716418

4878673,4,B005S9ELG2,"As it happens, I was already fond of Emilio Estevez as a director. Not many thought much of his initial efforts in the big chair - but I still count '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-at-Work/dp/B000063JDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men at Work</a>' among my favorites. So, understandably, it was shocking to screen this project some twenty-two years down the road. Showcasing an incredible maturation that, quite frankly, is startling when you compare the two films side-by-side.

Yes, it's predictable and clichd. But like so many productions which deal with death and one's self-examination of life, symbolic of the film as well, the path to the same place can be so incredibly varied. A view that one repeatedly sees doesn't necessarily have the same value or meaning when seen through another's eyes. Example: A local resident sees Diamond Head. It's beautiful, but at the same time, it's just there. When a visitor sees it, it's a fantasy fulfilled and a picture postcard come to life. But when a returning combat solider sees it, it's Home - the safe loving embrace of family and friends.

The exact same situation yielding completely different perspectives, depending greatly on the journey one takes to get there. So too this tale.

It is, no pun intended, a well-worn retread. But Martin Sheen gives us so much more than a run-through performance. His heartfelt sincerity is evident as his character, Tom, undertakes a journey that exposes his vulnerability to the immense grief of losing his only child. The human element he hides and sublimates, battling to internalize a private suffering, when what he needs more than anything else is to release it - to reach out for help. Even if all that help amounts to is the comfort given by fellow petitioners and the odd traveler...or three. Sufferers all to one degree or another.

Ultimately, The Way is a gift from his late son - a ""truly meaningful life"". The same life Daniel wanted so desperately for himself, but couldn't express or explain to his emotionally sedentary father.

The flip side: There's an extraordinary unrealistic aspect to this film's premise, a preachy arrogance born out of wealth that I truly don't appreciate. Most people can't just up and leave their responsibilities to increase one's life quotient. It reveals the vast disconnect listening to people of means 'explain life' to the rest of us. Especially when the well-off see themselves as lost, when what they truly are is bored. Truth: You don't get bored when you're struggling every single day with two jobs, putting food on the table, keeping the lights on and preventing your children from homelessness. Taking off to travel and discover a ""meaningful life"" isn't an option when you're grinding to survive. Just sayin'. <hands raised in defense>

Additionally, some of the characters felt quite staged - amusing, but equally, much too clever. The Chaucerian writer on-the-road was a stretch; the mad innkeeper, however insanely hilarious, felt contrived and overdone; the honorable gypsies decidedly unbelievable with telltale signs of romanticizing.

But those are minor knocks in an overall solid production.

Honestly, if no one had said this was directed by Emilio - and then bet me to guess the filmmaker behind the lens - I would've gone bankrupt. No way could I have foreseen what a talent he had become over the years. If the established film community doesn't see it, then cinephiles are screwed. There will be no hope in finding alternatives to Michael Bay's outlandish creations or James Cameron's more recent infantile products.

If you've ever lost someone you truly loved and miss with all your heart, you know that pain is so very personal. 'The Way' is a deeply emotional film that will touch you in ways that many cannot see or understand because you're on your own path and on your own journey.

Movie Notes:

- I was very surprised to see Joaquim de Almeida ever so briefly in one scene, fully expecting him to play a larger role in the film. To then not see him began a mental itch. Editorial cut? Or something more finessed? Interesting.

- And another interesting cameo, veteran character actor Matt Clark. Suspect a personal connection to the filmmakers that I'd love to hear more about.

- Given the theme, I wonder if the character of Tom was inspired, in part, by Saint Thomas? He of the doubt and redeemed faith. One wonders.

Personal Notes:

- El Ramon The Innkeeper is a small half-step from Norman Bates and his 'mother'. Stamp or no stamp, I've been trained for the outdoors, so you guys are on your own. Seeya!",1346544000,,4626,5.0130378096479795
4878674,5,B005S9ELG2,I have now seen this movie fourteen (14) times. I continue to feel its freshness and spiritual content each time I view it. Plenty of other reviewers have discussed the story line so I will not repeat them. Only to say that there are some extremely strong performances by the actors involved. Tcheky Karyo as a french policeman gives the movie an early lift by explaining to Tom (Martin Sheen) what walking the Camino de Santiago means to people. All of the actors are superb. You will get lost in the story unfolding before you and forget you are watching a movie. This is a must see for all who are interested in the mystery of life and how we are all connected.,1346198400,,664,4.40650406504065
4878712,5,B005S9ELG2,This is an absolutely beautiful movie. I was intrigued by the 'secret' and painful pasts of each of the characters and how they sought to resolve their inner pain.

An awesome and enjoyable movie!,1346198400,,359,4.625
4878713,5,B005S9ELG2,This movie was well done and depicted some very important portions of the Camino Walk.  I had just returned from that area of Spain as a guest of the Spain Board of Tourism because I am a Travel Agency Owner.  Those of us that were on this Gastronomy and Wine Tour were introduced to this area from the Travel Agent point of view.  It was an amazing experience and I was very moved by the movie. I have been in some of those hostels and they are just what the movie depicted.  Well done! I will recommend it to all my clients that are thinking about traveling to Spain as it is something not to be missed.,1346112000,,605,4.145299145299146
4878714,3,B005S9ELG2,"This movie was worth watching mostly for the scenery along the Camino. It made me want to go there and see it for myself. However, the acting was not that great. The side characters were more compelling than the main characters. Probably the Canadian girl that Martin Sheen's character meets up with was the most convincing actress.

The thing that annoyed me the most was that I have seen this advertised as a ""Catholic"" movie and that is a misrepresentation. It shows aspects of a culture that was once Catholic, but it does not have a clear Catholic message. The message is more about finding yourself and being open to making new friends, which are not bad messages, but not specifically Catholic messages, either. Also, the main character spreads the cremated ashes of his son all along the Camino as he goes, which is not allowed in the Catholic Church. The Church allows but does not encourage cremation, and if a person is cremated, his ashes are to be buried, just as his body would be. It is absolutely not allowed to scatter them to the four winds. So if you are not clear on Catholic doctrine, don't take this movie as a good example of what Catholics are allowed to do.

Martin Sheen's character is a lapsed Catholic who is trying to feel reconciled to his son. That is his motivation for doing what he does in this movie. There is no clear conversion to the Faith, just a conversion to being a ""nice guy"". There is what seems like a conversion, but the very end of the movie makes it clear that the Faith is not as important as seeing the world and being open to people who are different from you.",1346112000,,1611,4.476190476190476

Thank you Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez for this lovely offering to the film audience.  How wonderfully refreshing to see a film about a sincere, if ""accidental"" spiritual journey (instead of the hideous subject matter of the aforementioned film!

Having watched Martin Sheen through a lifetime of his performances and also having seen his son Emilio in a few, it was impossible not to consider their relationship while watching this.  Then there has been all of the tabloid gossip about his other son and namesake, Charlie Sheen.  I had to wonder how Martin's feelings about his two sons informed his performance here.  Of course we'll never know that, nor should we.

The story is relatively simple:  four people from different countries meet up on the famous pilgim's trail and fall in with each other.  It's a modern Canterbuy Tale.  As someone said, no one travels the trail by accident and one gets the feeling that these four were destined to meet each other, too.  Their interactions are just part of the miracles that each one is looking for, whether or not they can name them.

The acting is very good. The scenery is wonderful.  The story is good.  The characters are believable; each one has problems and weaknesses and each one has something of value to offer the others.  Just like life.  See it and be inspired.",1344643200,,1496,4.766536964980545

4878745,5,B005S9ELG2,"I can only give this movie 5 stars. Sure, one can find a few flaws and points of criticism if one dissects it, but ultimately what matters is that the movie spoke to me in the profoundest sense. A father grieving the loss of his wanderlust-stricken son (who met with an accident just as he had started on the Camino de Santiago trek) decides to undertake the journey for (and at a deeper level, with) his son, dispersing his ashes along the way. En route, he meets and eventually bonds with a motley group of other hikers. The emotional aspects are addressed with sensitivity but not cloyingly. And for those not a priori familiar with the Camino de Santiago (I was not), it also serves as a well-shot documentary of what seems a beautiful route through the Pyrenees. As the father advances in his journey, he not only acquires the fortitude to overcome his grief, he also finds himself opening to and understanding the life his son chose to live. The tagline says it all: ""You don't choose a life, you live one"".

If you think that the possibilities of life extend beyond just ""settling down"" while still holding family dear, if seeing ""a world in a grain of sand"" seems more than trite poetry to you, if you think of yourself as a traveler, be your journey inward or outward---if any of these is true, then you will love this movie.

4878748,5,B005S9ELG2,"I will have to preface my review of this movie by saying that, much like the Camino, it is very personal.  Unless you have experienced some major tragedy in your life, you may not fully grasp how absolutely powerful this movie is.  Sure, the characters are flawed, there is little actual ""religion"" in the movie for some and far too much for others.  Again, to me, this doesn't matter!

My 41 year old wife of 6 years passed away in September of 2011.  I had stayed home from work on Valentine's Day this year and had decided to watch some movies.  I had been searching through the guide on my satellite when I came across this movie, I'd seen it pop up there as an advertisement several times over the course of a few weeks.  I read the synopsis and immediately realized that it paralleled my own life.  I had been preparing for a backpacking journey to Budapest, Vienna and Prague in a few weeks and I was feeling kind of guilty about it.

When I started watching this movie it immediately spoke to me!  I had to pause it several times so that I could bawl my eyes out.  Again, for me this movie was incredibly personal, I felt like something higher was drawing me to it.  The story and scenery are amazing, the ups and downs of the movie explain the highs and lows of the camino.  For me, this is the very best movie I have ever seen and I love movies!  It may not be for everyone.

After my own personal journey to Central Europe I had made a commitment to myself that I would take a journey for our anniversary every year that I could.  After kicking around all sorts of ideas from others' suggestions and my own and my wife's previous discussions of where to go, I finally realized what this movie has been telling me.  I am planning my own Camino journey in April 2013.  I won't be able to do it all at once, but over the course of a few years, I'll finish!

So when my wife rented this movie and wanted to watch it with me I hemmed and hawed around for a couple of days until I heard someone on the local Catholic station raving about it.

It's a small film, made on the actual Camino de Santiago itself, very scenic. The stops look like place you'd want to visit yourself. Sheen is carrying the cremated remains of his son, who had died in the Pyrenees while walking this very same pilgrimage himself, and Sheen decides to finish the Way of St. James for him.

Along the way he picks up fellow travellers who are all on the pilgrimage for their own reasons: a cynical Canadian woman, an overweight Dutchman, and an Irish writer with writer's block.

Sheen is on his own mission and wants nothing to do with the rest of them, eventually getting drunk and telling them all off. He winds up in jail and is bailed out by the same people he was insulting a few hours earlier.

The final scenes at the Cathedral are fantastic, but I walked away with the notion that I keep forgetting: we are all on a journey through this life, and the people we bump against are our fellow travellers.

4878772,4,B005S9ELG2,"Yeah, the clichs, the predictable, the implausible, the stereotypes and the smugness are present. Yet they can't destroy this interesting little film. I saw a preview on some DVD a couple years back, and was intrigued, but assumed the usual Hollywood scoffing at religion would be on display, and journeys such as this could only be about enlightenment and personal spirituality.  But a person whom I admire immensely wrote a pretty positive review, positive enough to get me to take a real look. And I very much liked what I saw. Despite the flaws, they didn't mock sincere religious belief. They did not focus on ""What the church has to answer for"" and instead showed us how a sincere belief in God and an attitude of joyful humility and heartfelt gratitude can ameliorate life's problems. No, they don't go away. But yes, they can be borne.

What a pleasant surprise. What an un-Hollywood point of view. And what a well done film. Especially delightful is Yorick van Wageningen, who was mighty good in Winter in Wartime, thriving in a very different role. We don't know what will happen in his life going forward, but we do know it will be different. His world does not reject religion, it does not even acknowledge it. And he is forced to think about some things he'd rather not.

So, a well done look at what religion can mean, and what it can't. I just wish the film had ended 2 minutes earlier; the final scene was not only unnecessary but trite. Yep, travel for travel's sake is ultimately good, because, I suppose, as we learn about each other, we can resolve conflict. Well, lots of people around the world hate us rather profoundly, and they know us well. Let's close with a quote:

4878773,4,B005S9ELG2,"Martin Sheen plays an American doctor Thomas Avery, who has just lost his son Daniel (Sheen's real-life son Emilio Estevez, who also directs). Daniel was caught in the storm while walking the Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James, a pilgrimage road in northwestern Spain. In order to retrieve his son's body, Thomas flies to France, where, instead of going back to America, decides to go on a pilgrimage himself, with his dead son's ashes in a box.

The simple story may remind us of David Lynch's ""The Straight Story."" The difference is that Thomas travels with three strangers: fun-loving Joost (Yorick van Wageningen), cynical and chain-dsmoking Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) and Jack (James Nesbitt), an Irish travel writer having ""writer's block."" Tchky Karyo also appears as a kind French police captain.

What makes the film special is the strong performance of Martin Sheen, and the beautiful sceneries of the pilgrimage road. Supporting characters tend to be one-dimensional (the stereotypical portrait of a Dutchman Joost, for instance), and Estevez's episodic screenplay (based on a Jack Hitt book) needs some trimming (Estevez's character should be seen less frequently), but Martin Sheen's acting almost makes up for the lack of the depth of the script. The story is predictable and the journey is slow, but it is still worth taking.

4878776,3,B005S9ELG2,"This is  a beautifully shot travelog following four people on a long and physically demanding hike across Spain -- a trek that has served many as a ""pilgrimage"" that may lead its participants to an epiphany or reformation of their outlook on life.  But the film's four protagonists are seeking more mundane goals -- one wants to quit smoking, another to lose weight, a third to break his writer's block, while the fourth is acting on a spur-of-the-moment decision to take up the journey begun by his son, who died in attempting it.  At the end, two are not all that distressed to find themselves still smoking and overeating, the writer is happily scribbling away again, and we're not sure how things went for the father.  He is grumpy and uncommunicative throughout but finally accepting of the company and assistance of the other three.  The lesson overall seems to be that no one can make it through life without help from others.  I came away asking why this man is so negative in the first place.  Sadness over his son is understandable, but what he projects is more like a character trait not in keeping with what he has chosen to undertake.  And his physical performance throughout seems unlikely for a 60-year-old physician using someone else's gear.  These are loose ends that perhaps were answered in scenes deleted in the final cut.",1341446400,22,1343,4.754310344827586
4878777,4,B005S9ELG2,"My wife and I only rent about six DVD's a year, but she read about this one in a magazine and wanted to give it a try. As a loyal Amazonian, I looked up the reviews first. When there are a hundred or so, I usually read the one-stars first, because often I learn more quickly that way whether the film is one I might enjoy. So I read the one and two stars posted here, then a few three and four stars, and a couple of five stars. Most of the posters who did not like the movie thought it was overlong, boring and had unlikeable characters. While I agree that the film has a few flaws, they were certainly not fatal, and in fact, quite minor. Both my wife and I stayed connected to the characters all the way through, and felt it was just long enough. It had a few really nice laughs, and few moments that could easily produce tears, and many smile moments, and a few ""ouch"" scenes because the travelers were humans who were stressed and damaged and failed opportunities for kindness and understanding. But overall, we liked Martin Sheen and the handful of misfits who walked 500 miles with him through rural Spain. The film does not distain or promote Roman Catholicism. Rather it depicts some of its beauty and historical importance. It does not graft ""New Age"" spiritual ideas onto the way of St. James, except for how ordinary people often merge ""modern"" religious sensibility with a reluctant but persistent attraction to the awe and mystery of ancient faiths. Above all, it is the story of how a long walk with strangers might slowly heal the hurts of humans: grief, abuse, estrangement, loneliness, dissatisfaction with one's work or one's body, etc. There is more talk than action, but that's true of most films I like. This is meat for thoughtful people who have experienced both joy and sadness, delight and disappointment in their lives.",1341360000,12,1846,4.563253012048193

As I was on pilgrimage on the spanish part of ""Camino"" twice myself, I recognised so many situations. Everything in this film is so well observed. The characters, the accomodation, the people you meet, the international spirit. The Pilgrimage to Santiago de Compstela (today) has't have to be a religious undertaking for oneself, not necessarily. But in any case it is a spiritual experience, that will change your life. Because of the friendship of complete strangers, that you experience, the kindness of the inhabitants, the exertions of the walk. You are fighting against inner demons of all kind, but at the same time you get so many good things from the other pilgrims. And this is, what the film shows brillianty. It is tragic and very funny the same time. I loved it!!",1340841600,,912,4.635802469135802
4878827,5,B005S9ELG2,"I am a huge fan of the Irish actor James Nesbitt, which is what put this film on my radar (he is a co-star in it). This movie had me reaching for the Kleenex within the first fifteen minutes, and yes, it is very sentimental and touching but it never feels like cheap sentiment. It has a very down-to-earth storytelling style grounded by Martin Sheen's performance and the excellent job that Estevez did of writing Sheen's character, a man not given to emotional displays, soul-searching, or spontaneous adventures. Yet, over the course of the movie, as he comes to grips with a deep loss, he is transformed by the literal and figurative path that he is taken. I loved the directorial decisions from Estevez, especially the way he handled the idea that Tom (Sheen's) son is with him along the way. And one of my favorite things about this movie is how it depicts the way that the strange, random encounters we have with other human beings can help to heal and transform us. All in all, I really felt this was a perfect movie. It handles its subject matter perfectly and invites us all to approach life with a little more curiosity and openness in our hearts.",1340755200,,1157,4.5673076923076925

It's an uplifting story about people who are dealing with their struggles in life and the role spirituality plays in dealing with those struggles.

If you're expecting a sentimental tear-jerker (like I was), prepare to be blindsided. The screenplay offers interesting, complex characters in a story that borrows ideas from CANTERBURY TALES, THE WIZARD OF OZ and the biography of Joni Mitchell. Moments of tension, humor and insight are nicely modulated, leading to an understated climax that is genuinely moving.

Although the film exhibits its Catholic roots, especially near the end, it ultimately rises above sectarianism. ""Religion has nothing to do with it,"" as the gypsy man notes quietly.

Visually, the Blu-ray image exhibits a soft, organic quality that is very pleasing. It was photographed in Super 16mm in natural light, and looks like real cinema, with plenty of lovely scenery.

The soundtrack is excellent, with an tasteful selection of pop songs spanning several decades. James Taylor fans will discover an alternate studio take of his classic ""Country Road.""

The story shows the development and changing characters of a collection of people who ordinarily would not have reasons to associate with each other. The journey changes every one of them.

In 'The Way', Emilio Esteves demonstrates that a person's life is more than an experience of the material world.  It is also a pilgrimage into the spiritual realm.  Scenes from the Spanish countryside are breathtaking while the story is told in a truly earthy and credible way.

Four troubled strangers are drawn for different reasons to take part in a traditional backpacking trip across the Spanish countryside, culminating in a visit to an ancient shrine. Through shared experience and mutual support, they become friends along The Way.

The characters are charming and deep and real. The acting is superb. The music and camera help to bring you into the beautiful setting. The DVD includes special features that describe the background and experience of the actors and crew during production.

This is an important movie for the way that it touches on real and enriching life lessons. The Way can make a difference for anyone.

4878876,4,B005S9ELG2,"I don't anticipate doing this trek myself, but lately I've been reading books written by those who have walked ""The Way of St. James."" Though I've been to Spain a few times, it's only recently that I heard about this journey.

In the midst of looking for other books on the topic, I stumbled upon this movie. It took me a while to sit down and finally watch it, but I'm very glad I did.

The story-line is fairly straight-forward and the movie doesn't deviate much from the central theme. If nothing else, the movie was literally filmed along the pilgrimage, and thus, the scenery is incredible. Most of the other walkers in the film aren't 'extras,' but rather, they were actually doing the walk as the film was being made. Even some of the characters in the movie (the sheepherder, for example), were locals.

I found myself touched by this movie, and was often tearful, if only out of sympathy for Sheen.

Once one completes the walk, they are asked a central question. I won't tell you what that question is, but for our main character, I'm not sure it was ever answered, and if anything, only barely inferred. I hope I didn't miss something.

Anyhow, the characters in the film are likeable, and though we get a window into their own motives for doing the walk, it never clouds Sheen's role. Granted, this film isn't a polished, Hollywood flick, but its simplicity fits with the whole aura of the Santiago.

I'm glad that I watched it, and it was great having visuals to put to the books I've read thus far on the Santiago de Compestela.

My favorite part of the film (besides the scenery) is the amazing relationships that are formed between people that in ""normal"" day-to-day life would never be friends. In a world where technology rules, we are becoming less personal. This movie reminds us to get out there, travel, explore, take some risks, and talk to people.

In life, the father had been too busy, too wrapped up in life's menial tasks to spend the kind of quality time that his son wanted from him.  The pilgrimage to El Camino de Santiago begins with the father, Tom, feeling closed off to the world, but as he travels, three other travelers are drawn into his world, and he learns to open his heart.  The scenery is spectacular and the story is so touching.  I think this story really moved me because it's more than just a movie about a parent losing a child.

4878894,5,B005S9ELG2,"""As someone who prefers movies about realistic experiences and relationships between people, I fell in love with THE WAY, a movie written, produced and directed by Emilio Estevez, which stars his father, Martin Sheen. I also love movies that flirt with the subject of spirituality without force-feeding religion down its viewers' throats. Emilio handles this cautiously and skillfully, inspiring conversation without controversy. While there are certainly hints of Christianity and Catholicism throughout the movie--as it takes place along El Camino de Santiago--the movie is really about the different relationships people have with God, in this case the people who make this spiritual journey to the burial place of St. James.

I'm both impressed and inspired by Emilio's skills at storytelling. Within the main story of a father grieving his son's passing, there are also characters coming to terms with their weight, past trauma, and lack of inspiration. Yet these underlying challenges are merely the backdrop to the individual interactions between the characters, as well as the dramatic, and often humorous, adventures they stumble upon. Everything about this movie is understated--in a good way--meaning that the writer/director and actors assume the viewers are intelligent enough to not need everything spelled out for them. And the fact that I never knew what to expect next, and was often surprised by the outcome, was simply the cherry on top.""

4878896,5,B005S9ELG2,"I did not expect much when I chose this movie out of boredom, however I was pleasantly surprised and this is the best movie I have seen in a year. The Way is about an uptight dentist (played by Martin Sheen) whose son dies while walking El Camino de Santiago (the way of Saint James). His son (played by Emilio Estavez) is an ex-graduate student who began the trip in order to find himself. Sheen decides to walk the Camino to honor his son, although he is told that one can only walk the Camino for one's self. Along the way he meets a group of interesting individuals and they form an unofficial group. For Sheen, what begins as a walk of tribute turns into a time of self discovery and healing. Sheen is deeply altered and in the end we are left to determine whether he walked for himself or his son. Trust me, the movie is better than it sounds. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Best of all, it is a movie for the entire family.

Contrary to other reviews this is not a religious movie and there is no covert proselytizing, this movie is essentially about a group of people struggling with their own histories, lives, and personalities. Only one of the characters appears to be religious and he is a bit embarrassed to show it in front of his group. The fact that they walk El Camino de Santiago and not the Oregon trail is truly bonus as it some of the most incredible scenery. Also, some say the movie does not depict the walk as authentically as it should, but really how much can you squeeze into one movie.

To my surprise it was actually a very good movie, a nice little travel film, and oh, I dunno, had a decent plot too. There are no car chases, firy explosions or ridiculolus special effects, just good acting, good directing, and a zen-like exploration of who we are, who we think we are, where we're going, and why. It eases into its depth with humor and style and while it's premise borders on the religious pilgrimage to the shrine at Santiago, Spain, it's actually more of a buddy movie with a quartet of unlikely travellers who use the pilgimage as an excuse to deal with various degrees of loss; of loved ones, of self, faith, or just a writer's fickle muse.

After traveling to Spain to collect his sons remains, Martin Sheen's character decides to walk the 500+ mile journey with his son's cremains, so his son can complete the spiritual journal. . It's a touching movie that explores a father's grief and regrets. It doesn't beat you over the head with its religious themes, and it's not really an orthodox Catholic movie.

In order to honor his son's pilgrimage said father takes the ashes of his son and continues the pilgrimage. Along the way he meets some colorful characters on the trek who have issues of their own. Overall, it isn't terribly religious and the bigger focus is on ""the undiscovered Spain"" with some good camera angles and even a focus on the gypsy subculture which was particularly well done.

4879018,4,B005S9ELG2,"I recommend ""The Way"" for anyone looking for a light, funny, feel-good movie on a rainy Sunday. Basic no-surprise plot. Good casting buckled with very good soundtrack, humor, captivating vistas and mouth watering food scenes. And the lead character (Martin Sheen) is, like me, an acknowledged ""Believer of Convenience"" (Easter, Christmas) so the flick resonated with me.  The 2-minute trailer on YouTube captures the plot nicely.

Story: Tom (played by Martin Sheen) is a 60+ year old ophthalmologist who learns that his 40 year old estranged son dies on Pilgrimage in Northwest Spain (El Camino de Santiago).  He travels to identify and retrieve his son. He decides to take two months off work after learning about the Pilgrimage.  On his journey, he runs into Yost (a large, kind-hearted, funny Dutchman), Sarah (a sharp tongued French Canadian beauty) and Jack (an Irish writer).  They each have their own non-religious personal reasons for making the pilgrimage yet they each exit the trek with it having left a profound impact on them.  No cliffhangers on this plot - fairly straightforward - but the packaging makes it enticing.

Music: Loved it.  Including but not limited to James Taylor (""Walking Down the Country Road""); Nick Drake (""Pink Moon""); Alanis Morissette (""Thank you"") and David Gray (""My Oh My"").

Food: What's not to like.  Simple.  Fresh.  Bread.  Wine.  Cheese.  Lamb.  Outside dining on wooden tables with friends.  When can we leave for Spain?

Location: Spectacular cinematography of vistas in France and N.W. Spain.  This movie inspired me to add this ""walk"" to my bucket list.

4879019,5,B005S9ELG2,"This is truly an enjoyable film. In terms of storyline and dialogue, it is minimalist. And yet, the director, Emilio Estevez (Martin Sheen's son) has captured a depth and richness: realistically demonstrating the principle of ""less is more"" through emotional sparseness, visual beauty, and keen perspective. It is a ""feel-good"" film, not in your typical canned Hollywood-style, but because it touches a universally human chord: how each of us navigates the wounds of life. The theme of suffering, forgiveness, and connection are delicately interwoven into a realistic journey, and I found myself vicariously arising each morning with the characters in anticipation of another day on the path--not knowing what the day would bring, or how the events would change my/their direction, but strong in resolution to keep going even as I was being challenged to surrender to the winds of destiny. This film may not rock your world, but it will imperceptibly loosen the rigid corners of your psyche and lift you up into a celebration of life.",1335052800,2,1034,5.160714285714286

4879061,4,B005S9ELG2,"The photography was wonderful. I think this will go down as one of Martin Sheen's best ever performances. He underplays his role (due to Emilio's direction?) which makes it all the stronger. In fact, it's the understated quality of the whole film that makes it very moving. It never descends into sentimentality but you still feel the grief of Martin Sheen's character as he makes the pilgrimage his estranged dead son never completed. At the same time, there are a lot of funny moments, which lift it from becoming a depressing journey. The gradual coalescing of the four very different main characters into a unified group works very well. Each of them has a different reason for making the pilgrimage and, to begin with, they seem to have nothing in common, but it's still very believable when they start to relate to each other. Emilio and his father Martin have every reason to be very proud of this film. It works on every level.

We enjoy the movie so much that we have purchased multiple copies to give as gifts for birthdays, weddings and just-because.

One word to the wise - Parents, you need to preview the movie before showing it to your children.  The content is safe by ""American Culture"" standards.  However, there is some drug usage (it is done in a manner that is appropriate for the movie).  After seeing the movie we felt that is was fine for our 16 year old to watch.

4879096,4,B005S9ELG2,"Father and son, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez, have put together a nice little film about the pilgrimage, ""El Camino de Santiago"", in Spain. Sheen drove the route with his grandson and thought it would be an interesting idea to do a documentary about the pilgrimage, but Estevez thought it would work better as a feature film and ""The Way"" proves Estevez's instincts were right.

""The Way"" is about father and son Daniel Avery (Emilio Estevez) and Thomas Avery (Martin Sheen) who don't have the best of relationships, but Daniel wants to see the world and embarks on the pilgrimage in Spain ,""El Camino de Santiago"", also known as ""The Way of Saint James"" and father and son go their separate ways. Thomas Avery is involved in his life, playing a round of golf when he learns of Daniel's death in the Pyrenees mountains during a rainstorm so Thomas goes to Spain to collect the body of his son. While he gets his son's affairs in order he learns of the pilgrimage his son had embarked upon and decides to honor the journey by completing it for him. As Thomas hikes the roads from town to town of the pilgrimage he meets fellow pilgrims who have taken up the quest for their own particular reasons. Borrowing a bit from the ""Canterbury Tales"", Estevez (who also wrote and directed) imbues the characters with the same archetypal qualities but gives them all one thing in common, they're all caught up in their own worlds and as they met and journey together on this road, the more they're able to reveal of themselves and come out of themselves.

""The Way"" is a quiet movie, no big scenes, no big acting, Martin Sheen of course turns in a nicely nuanced portrait of a man at first caught in his world but slowly expands his horizons, there's not even a big moment of epiphany that explains it all for the characters or us, the characters find their own peace in their own time and their own way.",1334016000,8,1896,4.54093567251462

4879152,4,B005S9ELG2,"This extraordinary movie is earned a 4/5 stars, because of the emotions touch your heart, inspires you to live your life spontaneously, and teaches about friendship that overcome addictions and insecurities.

The Way is based upon a true story. Which takes place on the El Comina trial. A guy in about his mid twenties decided to do the trial and he dies the first day. That's when his father had to go up there and identify his sons body. Now there is no telling what he will do.

I purchased this movie during March of 2012 out of a Red box. Truthfully, I've only seen this movie once but that's all it took to touch me. This movie made me change my viewpoints about life.

The Way contains great care of emotions, the first being about his sons death. This shows tons of emotions, because his father gets his sons body cremated. Then he decides to walk to trial and spread his ashes throughout the trial. This specific event that happened made me realize that everyone should do everything they want at least once before they die.

Also, it shows inspiration, such as taking chance at new things. This inspired me because the son was chasing after his dreams, going to the places that have an impact in his life. But sadly he didn't make it past day one. He has encouraged me to not be afraid and made me realize that you always should be optimistic about life and have no regrets.

Finally, it shows trustworthiness, dependable, and unjudgemental friendships between strangers.  It influenced me to look at people from the inside and always be there for someone in need because we all need a friend by our side.
The only downside I've experienced so far was the lack of statistics. With more statistics it would've made the movie a little more heart touching. For instance, all throughout the movie I was wondering how long it took to walk the trial. But that is a mystery that will remain unknown.
If you're looking for a film with people facing reality and surving their struggles, The Way is an excellent choice.

The promotion for ""The Way"" say that it is a powerful and inspirational story about family, friends, and it is that and more!

Life challenges us all while we try to keep an even keel in an ever changing and complex world.

Martin Sheen portrays an American doctor who comes to France to collect the remains of his adult son (played by Sheen's real ife son Emilio Estevez), who died in an accident in a Pyrenees' flash storm while walking the pilgrimage called The Camino de Santiago. In a surprising turn, the father at the last minute cancels all of his medical office appointments for a month and elects to walk the several hundred miles on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son's desire to finish the journey.

What is moving about this movie is a variation of a ""bucket list"" - realizing there is more to life.  The interaction with other hikers is touching and real.

It is a shame this movie did not have a better opportunity to be seen by more viewers.

4879190,3,B005S9ELG2,"I had no real expectations going into this film.  I'd heard it was about a father who'd lost his son and went on a journey after that, but those vague descriptions were about all I knew about this movie.  I guess I was afraid it would turn out like ""the Father's Tale.""  It didn't, but I didn't really enjoy it all that much either.

It's a story where a father loses his son in a freak accident while his son is on a pilgrimage, so the father takes his son's ashes on said pilgrimage, as a way to honor his wishes, I guess.  It's not an enormously-exciting concept, but I have to admit that it could have been done much worse.  However, it could also have been done much better.

On his journey, the father; Tom, runs into a few other pilgrims.  One wants to quit smoking, one wants to lose weight, one is looking for an end to his writer's block... they eventually form a group of merry men, if you will, who continue on the road together, each with their own goals and aims, none of them particularly religious, yet all of them with the gall to go on a religious pilgrimage.

Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying you need to be a saint to go on a pilgrimage.  What I am saying is that when none of the main characters of your pilgrimage movie have any desire to better their souls in any way, you're asking for trouble.  The group of them complete the pilgrimage, and then just kind of go back to their own lives.  There's a lot of religious imagery in this film, but to me, that counts for precisely jack squat when the meaning and purpose of said imagery is so well-concealed.

If you were very charitable towards this film, you might say that the characters seemed to have a sort of religious experience at the end, and their spiritual lives will probably improve from what they've seen and witnessed, but there's no real proof of that.  If you were really bitter with this movie, you could say that it's just trying to use tried-and-true religious imagery, symbols, names and locations to try to elevate secular humanism to a religious level that it doesn't deserve, but there's no proof of that either.

In the end, though, there's no denying that a lot of religious terms and images were used, and nothing of any real consequence came of it.  That by itself is something of an insult to those of us who actually know what these things mean and cherish them for the truths that they assist us in acquiring and benefitting from.  Am I personally insulted by this movie?  Not really.  Films with no message are too bland to insult me, but they also don't impress me in any way.

I guess you could say that there's one scene where a woman discusses her history with a child that she almost had, and her abortion, and how she dealt with the grief of the awful crime she committed, which could be a pretty awsome scene if it was handled well, but the discussion is over in a minute and a half, and it's never brought up again.  Even when it is brought up, there's no questioning the morality of what was done, just a couple people talking about how they feel.

If you like this film, good for you.  If you don't like it, good for you too.  Me personally, I can't say I particularly belong to either camp, and I think I could sum up my experience with this film with the simple word ""meh.""

Without ever becoming treacly or pietistic, the movie was also very respectful of the pilgrimage tradition of the Catholic Church, which makes it a fairly unusual film for Hollywood, 2011.  Another reviewer expressed surprise that one of the characters was so "" impressed by the overpowering Catholic cathedral symbolism that [made him] kneel before a church pillar....""  He shouldn't have been so surprised, pilgrims have been doing such things for fifteen hundred years and more.  St. Helena (mother of Constantine) went on pilgrimage around 320 AD.  Although I have a friend who has made the pilgrimage to Compostela, I haven't.  In addition to going to such shrines as Lourdes, Ste. Anne de Beaupre and the Miraculous Medal Chapel in Paris, I have had the blessing, though, of visiting St. Peter's in Rome several times each, during four trips to the Eternal City.  Each time I have visited the basilica, I have gone to say prayers (to God and His holy Mother, as well as to St. Peter for intercession to God) before the bronze(?) statue of St. Peter on the right side of the nave.  As have millions of other pilgrims, I always kiss the foot of the statue on the spot worn shiny by millions of people before me.  It seems quite natural when I do it and it remains a pleasant recollection during the periods between visits.

Likewise, when I went to the Cathedral of Canterbury, I wanted to say prayers before the tomb of St. Thomas a Becket.  Unfortunately, that evil man, Henry VIII, had viciously destroyed that shrine and so I was left to say a prayer at the spot where it used to be.  The Anglicans temporarily running the Cathedral have had enough good sense to point out the spot, probably to ensure that they could collect more of the fees that they are charging for entrance to the Cathedral.  [Think of that, Catholic cathedrals don't charge people for entry, but Canterbury Cathedral, the headquarters of the Anglican Church ""BY LAW ESTABLISHED"" in England charges money for entry].  In all events, the movie was very respectful of pilgrimage while also recognizing that some people may trek to Compostela for other reasons.  The interplay of those diverse motives heightened the dramatic tension and thereby made for an even more engaging film.

And Spain was beautifully shot.  What a gorgeous place.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way/dp/B0062VL4QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way</a>",1332374400,,2491,5.126237623762377

It just has this quiet power that leaves you thinking hard about your life and what you have done with it.

I am writing this review only from the heart. After seeing The Way, I literally wanted to make plans immediately to do my own pilgramage on the Way of St. James. Of course (unfortunately) that will never happen. I am too busy and too preoccupied living the life I chose (see the movie for the significance of this comment) to ever do something as transformative and risky as taking a month off to trek the backroads of the Spanish Basque country.

He discovers that his son was starting on a journey, the 800 kilometer Camino de Santiago. Although many Americans have never heard of it, this has been a famous pilgrimage for over 1000 years. On impulse, he decides to carry his son's ashes along the route.
Although the father is initially angry and hostile, shunning the offers of company, he cannot avoid human contact. The relations between him and his fellow pilgrims is the heart of this story, as well as the difficult relationship he had with his son. In these adventures the characters show themselves as funny, beautiful, and sad. I was quickly hooked, and enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.

The filming took place along the actual Camino, a beautiful panorama of northern Spain. Although this is historically a catholic pilgrimage, the main characters are not religious, and there is no reason to avoid this film if you are averse to religion. Each travels for their own reasons, which gradually become manifest.  The film is beautifully done.

4879230,5,B005S9ELG2,"Emilio Estevez is a better director than I ever gave him credit for, apparently--""The Way"" is one of the best films I have seen emerge in the last 2 or 3 years.  With the slow evolution of each character, flawed, human, and all too human, we begin to feel the possibility of change in ourselves.  Estevez does not use the religious elements of the film too overtly or alienate potential viewers'.  Instead, he gives us an unflinching portrait of four annoying people who are offered the possibility of radical change, as we all are at some point in our lives, and he does so without missing a beat.

Tom (Martin Sheen) is a cranky ophthalmologist who has a troubled relationship with his son, Daniel.  A student in anthropology, Daniel is determined not to stay in the confines of the University and to see the beauty and majesty of the world as other anthropologists have before him.  His father discourages him from doing so and worries about his safety.  Just a few days after dropping him at the airport, Tom's worst fears are realized.  His son strayed from the path of his journey, got caught in some rough weather, and died.  He was travelling the path of the El Camino de Santiago, a route of joy and penance for Catholics, tourists, and anyone looking for a beautiful and healthy trek from France to Spain.

Tom, stricken with grief, travels to France to collect his son's body.  He has Daniel cremated and collects his ashes in a small box, and in a moment of what one can only call bitter inspiration, he decides to walk the Camino in spite of being 70 years old and not necessarily in the best of health.

""The Way"", as this particular Camino is referred to, leads to the supposed burial site of the apostle St. James, whose ashes were buried underneath the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Santiago, Spain.  While there are traditional travelling routes to the Cathedral, most take their own and in the film, Tom and the people he encounters (a drugdealing, obese Dutchman, an angry Gen X Canadian named Sarah, and a pretentious Irish poet) are certainly taking the non traditional path.

Tom is trying to make some sense of his son's senseless death while the other three try to catch up with him, physically and otherwise.  Some ugly things happen on the Way, some very human ugly things, but each pilgrim finds his/her own peace, at least for the moment.  No one emerges unscathed.

An interesting but disappointing film.  Debora who was suffering from the loss of her little girl by her abortion should have at least named her child and then at the end rescued a little girl, only to discover that she had the same name.  Martin Sheen should have been asking why his son was going on the pilgrimage and slowly found him self becoming more spiritual and finally realizing that his son was in a sense giving birth to the father. All of the characters should have been becoming more spiritual with the last scene having them in church before the altar.  Throwing a person's ashes everywhere is strictly forbidden by the Catholic Church. There was a priest but given no importance. In the end the characters were still the same after the 800 Km walk and the pilgrimage did nothing for them.  Wm. Paul Tasin",1331424000,7,828,4.574324324324325

After the movie ended everyone else something to say, though I found myself wanting to go home and just quietly think--it was very personal.

Having done a long walk in Ireland (The Kerry Way)with my three brothers I also thought they did a great job of capturing the rhythms, dynamics and even social aspects of a long walking trip.

With only 2 weeks vacation a year, I could not do it while working, and so, when I started planning for my retirement, the camino was a part of it.  It has been one of the most memorable, challenging and exciting trips I have ever taken, and The Way brought back all the wonderful memories, and having watched it three times, I feel like packing my gear and walking again.  I would say 95% of the movie is accurate, and here are some minor quibbles that constitute the 5%.  First, the first thing we pilgrims do when we reach the refugio is wash our clothes.  Because of the weight of the backpack, we only bring one change of clothing, and so it is imperative that whatever we wear during the day should be washed.  The characters in the movie seem to have many changes of clothing, and the only scene of somebody doing laundry was when Martin Sheen's character saw the guy in thong hanging his clothes.  Second, except for one instance when Sheen's character complained of painful feet, there was no mention of foot problems, particularly blisters, a pilgrim's nightmare.  Since he was walking for the first time, he surely would have had blisters.  Other than that, the movie is accurate.  The camaraderie among the pilgrims in the movie is authentic, the tight sleeping quarters are right on, and the hike on different kinds of terrain is familiar.  I like the scenes with the gypsies that show their positive side and did not dwell on their bad reputation.  The sense of wonder that the four friends felt in entering the basilica is very very familiar and brought back more memories.

""Da"" was one of my favorite sleeper films of the 80's, and with ""The Way"", a different character played by Sheen now has to travel from a comfortable life in the US, but now to collect the remains of his son, who has died on the first night of his attempting to walk to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela.

That critic unfortunately missed the point of the film, and again, I must quote Donne:
""No man is an island entire of itself; every man
 is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;
 if a clod be washed away by the sea,
 Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were,
 as well as a manor of thy friends or of thine  own were.
 Any man's death diminishes me,
 because I am involved in mankind.

4879266,5,B005S9ELG2,"Though the film may appear to be a simple story of a father's journey towards accepting his son's death, it also presents a sophisticated treatment of the predicament of modern spirituality. Naturally, the experience of loss, especially a loss as tragic as the death of a child, provokes a search for meaning. Tom, the father of the departed son, explores meaning in a two-fold way. First, is his urge to understand his son more deeply. And secondly, as he gains a greater understanding of his son's perspective on life, Tom simultaneously begins to understand another loss as well, his disconnection from a spiritual relationship with life. The film adeptly weaves these two stories of discovery together.

One of the film's strongest points is its representation of sincere moments of spontaneous spirituality. These moments should resonate with the viewer and provoke a personal inquiry into how these actions provide comfort and  give meaning to Tom. The spirituality in The Way presents spirituality in its essence. Though it falls within an historical tradition, replete with a variety of forms, images, and practices, it refuses to be simply repetitive and insists on being totally personal.

The film does an excellent job of articulating how a modern person allows himself to connect with deeper shared parts of our human experience and how, unfortunately, tragedy can force that connection. If one approaches the film without conservative or liberal criticisms, it should provoke genuine reflection about a topic that is intensely pressing and, yet, seemingly so detached from our daily lives.",1330560000,2,1603,5.2784313725490195
4879267,4,B005S9ELG2,"So you should read this only if you have seen the film already.

I liked the film, which has has been praised by many, and it undoubtedly has some great points: perhaps they make the film worth watching just for themselves:

- the wonderful photography of the holy images of the Camino de Compostela, including the statuary along the way and the gorgeous basilica's interiors and Mass.
- a strong, beautifully executed pro-life message, through the character of the one woman in the group of friends who talks about how her abortion early in life has marked her life
- the character of the French gendarme, my favorite character in the film, a man of deep faith, full of understanding, respect, and kindness towards the newcomer, suffering American

Alas, I found also a number of problems in the film. Starting with the blatant: I refer to the casual, not-recommended treatment Martin Sheen demonstrates with his son's ashes. It is not difficult to find the Church's position on this. So no, taking his son's ashes in a Ziploc bag inside a box in your backpack and scattering them along the way is definitely not recommended.

Then there is the issue of the characters Martin Sheen befriends along the way. From what I read, there are indeed representative of the people on the Camino, if all a bit flat and stereotypical: a Canadian woman hurting inside from past problems, a Dutch man attempting to lose weight, an Irishman undergoing writer's block. Well, for one thing, yes, after walking 800 kms the Dutch man would have lost some of his stomach for sure. The Canadian woman swears the whole way she will give up smoking when she gets to ""the feet of saint James"", but the viewer already knows she will not quit. The Irishman does conquer his writer's block as he begin writing about Martin Sheen's personal journey, but of all of the characters he is the most forced one. His entry into the story is short of a theatrical caricature. Let's say if you or I met someone acting like that we would keep walking.

Another problem is the very premise of the film: ""You don't choose a life, you live it"". Good grief, and what exactly does that mean? I beg to disagree. We absolutely make choices for our life, the question is not if we choose it or not, but what choices we do make, and how. A no-brainer here.

But what about Martin Sheen? What about his character, a wealthy, California doctor who had just  lived a very routine life so far? We are to believe that he is transformed, that his impulsive desire to take his son's ashes and scatter them through the Camino, accomplishing for him what his premature death made impossible, is a personal journey of discovery. Discovery of what exactly? The film seems to hint that he discovers himself and therefore God, or at least Love: he gets over, if reluctantly, of his closeness and anger, he begins caring for his newfound friends, and he evens hints to a priest along the way that his gift of a Rosary has ""come in handy"" (although that is not shown), and finally he is seen praying at the basilica, kneeling.

Finally, what crowned my problems about the film is the very end. The final, five second scene. After trekking with this man for almost 900 km we are to believe he has undergone this transformation. He now is a human being who has let go of his hangups, who has found God or at least Love. What would I like to see him doing? I know exactly what I would like to see him doing: I would like to see him going back to his responsible life of a caring doctor (which he was shown to be in the beginning of the film), now taking with him this newfound dimension of Love of Neighbor. So instead of wasting hours playing golf with his obnoxious friends I would like to see him choosing instead to volunteer at the Soup Kitchen, caring for other's problems and needs in a personal way, praying and being active in his parish, or doing similar works of charity. That is our calling, and a hard one, to do God's work where our life happens to be. So I'd like to him taking and applying to his daily life what he gained from the journey in the Camino. Instead, he is shown walking aimlessly, hippie-like, alone, through the streets of Morocco. Uh? How is that the life of someone who found true Love?

Like I said, I like the film, but I find that reviewers are usually very generous on their takes of Hollywood productions, more so than with books. Does this stem from low expectations? Perhaps.",1330560000,5,4451,4.526119402985074
4879268,4,B005S9ELG2,"A metaphor of the Camino: stumbling, aching in the beginning then ambling along in the right direction to a superb, uplifting ending.  It's as if the movie was directed by two individuals, a novice and a master.

The first hour contained massive, over-blown portrayals of the four major characters.  The introductory dialogues were lengthly with mega doses of dramatic excess.  Then after Burgos, in the second hour, a well-executed melodrama surged from s skillfully written screenplay.  The actors convincingly reflected pilgrims on their peripatetic journey of renewal.  The best and most moving scenes were when few words were spoken: the parador in Leon, placing stones at Cruz de Ferro, the arrival at the cathedral , and standing at the sea at the end of their journey.

Anyone who has walked the Camino from St Jean to Santiago could easily identify with the four pilgrims in the latter stages of their pilgrimage.",1330473600,2,922,5.066225165562914

4879280,5,B005S9ELG2,"As people can see from other reviews, there is a great deal that _can_ be said.  However, not to give any spoilers, here are a few of the really good things about The Way.

The music is well-chosen and actually adds to the story.

Of course, the acting is excellent.  The characters are real, believable and...well, imperfect as we all are to one degree or another.  As a viewer, you'll start to care about them.

Although some of the subject matter is rough, there isn't anything that is offensive or gross to watch.  However, as fair warning, some things are heart-wrenching.

As noted by other reviewers, the scenery is spectacular.

The story is--or stories are--interesting and well-written.  Again, I won't give any spoilers as to particulars, how things unfold as the pilgrims move along or some of the mini-adventures they have along the way.  It's well worth watching the movie.

One important note is that you'll enjoy watching this movie more than once.  There is plenty that you might miss on the first viewing, and it's enjoyable to watch.",1330300800,4,1052,4.810055865921788

I felt that the movie was actually very true to form. I have read reviews where people were criticizing the lack of depth of the characters, but the truth is, when you are traveling with people that you just met, this is very much how the relationships work. You may travel together for a few hours or weeks and I don't know if you ever really know who they are... but you are thankful for the companionship and different background.

What is compelling about this movie for me was how much it reminded me of my own travelling experiences and that in our own ways, we are all trying to solve for something. Believer or not, I think that the message in this film makes it enjoyable to watch. The actors do fine work, Martin seemed truly tired, very much like a man who has recently lost a son...

The Blu-ray version, however does have English subtitles. I bought the DVD version (assuming subtitles was a basic feature) because I read in several reviews that the picture quality of the Blu-ray was no better than DVD due to the way the film was originally shot - why spend the extra money. Also, there are no extra features on the Blu-ray vs DVD. However, since I purchased this for my father who is hard of hearing, he needs subtitles (doesn't like CC). I was forced to pay extra for Blu-ray just to have the basic feature of English subtitles. Why would they have English subtitles on the Blu-ray version only? It's a big rip-off if you ask me.",1330214400,4,792,4.545454545454546
4879284,5,B005S9ELG2,"I really loved the movie.  Not sure what message I'm getting out of the movie myself, but each character has their own emotional baggage that they literally carry on this journey.  To be honest, it's not a movie you wanna see over and over again, but it's a great film to watch with your father (if you're a son) if you guys have fallen out of communication with each other.  The visuals and scenery are really rich and beautiful and the music by Tyler Bates and various artists (although, you won't find Coldplay's ""Lost"" on the soundtrack) give the movie a nice drive.

The reason why I'm giving this movie three stars, is of its bonus features.  The biggest feature (every extra is identical on the Blu Ray and DVD releases) is the commentary with Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen, and producer David Alexanian.  Gives great background for the picture and points out things that are totally absent from the other special features.  The other features are as listed:

Camino Americana: Taking The Way on the Road (about a 3 minute feature focusing on when The Way rolled its way into towns and theaters across the country.)
Pilgrimage: Behind the Camera (about a 3 minute feature focusing on a little behind the scenes of a couple scenes.)
Father & Son: Uncovering the Characters (about a 2 minute feature focusing on what Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez thought about their characters and what the characters go through in the movie.)
Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son - a dual memoir by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez (a text-only feature focusing on the memoir ""Along The Way"").

I honestly wished there was A LOT more SUBSTANCE to the bonus features, but that's all we're getting right now.  But to hear Emilio's commentary is worth the price of the movie alone, and yes, like I said, both the DVD and the Blu Ray has both the SAME features.

This is a film worth watching, even if once, but I'm sure the memoir when it gets released will have a bit more substance about Emilio's inspiration to make this movie, especially with his father, Martin Sheen.

Within fifteen minutes or so I had closed the lid on my laptop and was sitting next to her watching it.  It was a wonderful movie about people from different backgrounds who make a great pilgrimage for what initially appear to be superficial reasons.

4879321,5,B005S9ELG2,"all I have to share is that if this film doesn't deeply touch you on some level it's time to make your final arrangements because you are likely already dead; you just don't know it yet.  The story is a compelling one, a grieving father undertakes his son's unfinished journey and perhaps in so doing finally learns to accept that his son was living his own life. Tom: ""My life here might not seem like much, but it's the life I choose.""  Daniel:  ""You don't choose a life Dad, you live one.""  The characters are flawed human beings just trying to find their own ""way"" through this muddled thing we call life. Fortunately the director chose to let each character reveal his or her strengths and weaknesses by incremental degrees. It is a slow paced film which allows the viewer time to absorb the story and especially time to reflect on and identify with aspects of each characters.  OK, when I get caught up in a film's story I can let some things slide.  For example: How is it that Tom who is ""old and tired"" and would rather ride the golf cart 3 feet away to his next shot manage to tackle an 800 KM trek (at a rather hearty pace no less!) with no previous training? I could have easily handled a bit longer film (121 minute run time) had they taken time and shown his bone tired, foot weariness.

4879324,4,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is sort of the epitome of a passion project. Named for the Camino de Santiago, or Way of St. James, a traditional Spanish pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, the film was initially inspired by the travels of director Emilio Estevez's father and son when they undertook the journey themselves. When Estevez decided he wanted to make a film about the Camino de Santiago, he wrote a part specifically for his father, then shot the entire thing on location with a small crew over 40 days and 200 miles. In the film, Martin Sheen plays a grieving father whose son lost his life while on the titular pilgrimage; he initially travels to Spain merely to retrieve the body, but decides to embark on the journey himself, meeting others on the trek who are all searching for some meaning themselves. While I felt the film meandered a bit and teetered on oversentimentality, I also felt it was a noble effort by Estevez, beautifully shot and powerfully introspective at its best.",1329782400,5,994,4.7514450867052025
4879325,4,B005S9ELG2,"As the story opens, Daniel (Martin Sheen) learns that his estranged son has died while walking the Camino de Santiago from France to Spain.  Daniel goes to retrieve the boy's body and decides to finish the 500-mile pilgrimage in honor of his son.  Along the way, he meets some other pilgrims who have their own reasons for doing the walk.

There's a lot to like about this movie: The location photography is lovely, the walk is an attractive, challenging effort, and Martin Sheen does an outstanding job as the bereaved father.  Unfortunately, I didn't care about his three fellow travelers and that made the movie less satisfying for me.  His companions are a loud and obnoxious Dutch man, a bitter Canadian woman, and an arrogant Irish writer, none of whom I liked.  I thought their bond would grow into something heartwarming and memorable but it didn't, and I found them annoying and unnecessary.  I would have preferred to have Sheen's character travel the road alone, with some pithy comments about fatherhood and loss, or maybe just a documentary.

The movie certainly shows the Camino to be a noble and enriching experience and it does make you wonder how you would handle it.  3.5 stars.",1329782400,4,1196,4.823529411764706
4879326,5,B005S9ELG2,"I was fortunate enough to attend a screening of ""The Way"".  This must experience movie, still gently tugs at my thoughts throughout the day.  I have read numerous opinions/reviews of the movie both before and after viewing The Way and find that the one thought that keeps coming to the forefront as I read the comments is...more.  More needs to be said about this movie.  More people need to experience this movie.

From the interviews I had watched or read about ""The Way""; there was a slight trepidation as I wasn't sure I was in the right space for a message movie as so many had been describing ""The Way"".  Not even the gentler phrase of theme movie took away my hesitance.  Yet, when I finally got the chance to take in ""The Way""...I didn't watch a film...I didn't just see a movie...I had a movie ""experience"".  I have missed the movie experience and am exhilarated at the artistry I was able to immerse myself in that evening.

Gladly, what I didn't come away with that evening was any feeling of having watched a message movie. Nothing overt and nothing veiled and I knew that others who have hesitated on taking in ""The Way"" specifically because of that representation of the movie, would instead run to see the movie...if they only knew...more!

Did I see that the characteristics of faith, belief, non-belief, finding what was perceived to be lost within oneself, accepting oneself as they are, being truthful and kind to ones own perceived failures as well as showing the same to others were included within the brilliantly scripted screenplay...definitely. They were all facets of the individual characters layered within the very character of the story...yes...and so much more.

When I heard Emilio recant how much of the movie was filmed in 16MM, I found myself thinking...more...tell them more! Tell them that even if it had been filmed with an 8MM camera the beauty of the terrain and the way the scenes are shot are so intoxicating that you would still inhale just a bit deeper...and find yourself savoring the sensations or the emotions that caress you as you watch the captivating images on the screen.  Tell them that while the screen fills with breathtaking scenery the enchanting music will gently carry you through the perfectly placed pauses...allowing your own thoughts at those moments pull you even deeper into the story with the brilliant use of silence.

I realized that the way Martin Sheen describes the movie in interviews is his own experience of the movie. I've had people describe the movie in so many different ways and have come to realize that no two opinions will be the same because everyone who sees this film will come away with their own individual experience of the film.

What do I mean when I say a movie experience?  You know...the films like Field of Dreams, Pretty Woman, Shawshank Redemption...the films you will sit down to watch...again and again.  A film that you will find yourself compelled to discuss with others...again...and again.  A film where the stories within the story and the characters...or maybe just one character...or a characteristic...a conversation...just touches something within you and draws you into the story where you are no longer an observer but a participant.  The type of film where one scene will cement itself into your memory the first time you view the movie and a different scene the fifth time you watch it...or the fiftieth...because a movie you ""experience"" changes each time you view it...the movie speaks to where you are at the moment...in your own journey...on that day.

""The Way"" is written with beautiful, poignant layers and numerous subtleties.  The characters are intricately infused with traits, beliefs, viewpoints, and histories so diverse that everyone will find something familiar to themselves or the people in their own lives.

""The Way"" celebrates the perfection within the imperfections of all the characters and the true acceptance of diversity without judgment.  The film respects the individual journeys in each of the characters lives within the encompassing journey of the pilgrimage on the Camino and the myriad of layers contained within that quest alone.

This film is a colorful tapestry created by the intricate weaving of each of the characters unique layers, the breathtaking scenery and the gentle pauses within the story that allow you to feel as though you are breathing in the moment and the captivating view at the same time as the characters are.  Emilio left enough space in the tapestry of this movie to allow the viewer to place their own thread down to be woven into this masterpiece and to feel the accomplishment, wonder and a deeper discovery of self alongside the characters individual discoveries during their time on the ""Way""

This story is filled with subtleties. You find yourself thinking from the way a scene unfolds that you are certain how the story will reveal itself next, only to turn the corner and the story actually unfolded to a different degree completely.  Discovering the intricate weaving of an undertone hidden between some of the layers that you are convinced will be explored...until you realize that the undertone remains just that, to make you question long after you left the theater why you were so convinced it would be...more.

Every film that becomes a movie experience has a quote that remains in your memory to invoke a smile...a remembrance of how the movie made you feel.  Just like the phrase ""If you build it they will come"" from Field of Dreams or ""And she rescues him right back"" from Pretty Woman...in this movie, The Way, the phrase ""You don't choose a life...You live one"" will pull at the tiny thread of your experience with this movie and gently call you back to see where the journey will take you the next time you enjoy the artistry of this film.

Every blockbuster has a scene that becomes a favorite for each moviegoer, whether it's the far stretching string of car lights at the end of Field of Dreams or the moment Julia Roberts character in Pretty Woman walks across the lobby of the hotel stunningly dressed for the opera.  Everyone will walk away from a movie experience with a scene that will remain etched into their memory.

In the movie ""The Way"" the scene that keeps popping up in my mind often...months later...is the poignant, breathtaking scene at the ocean.  That moment in the film, filled with quiet metaphors, captured my heart.  As I took in the magnificently beautiful, powerful vista before me on the screen I felt as if, I too, could feel the mist of the sea on my own skin as well.  I found myself inhaling a bit deeper in an effort to fully embrace the fusion of my own overwhelming emotions in that moment with the poignantly silent emotions of the characters.

I remain excited and filled with anticipation of experiencing the movie ""The Way"" again.  This movie leaves you with a desire...for more.  There has to be a next time...so many others have expressed that very same thought...youfll find yourself simplycwanting more of ""The Way"".  I look forward to discovering the subtleties I may have missed while letting those I did experience wrap themselves up in my own discoveries while experiencing this beautiful journey.  This film will call you back...for MORE!

Will the same scene touch me in the same way or will it be another scene that weaves its way into the tapestry of my own life at that moment? What beauty will I discover the next time that I may have missed from my first experience with ""The Way""?

I look forward to the feedback from friends and family members who for so long have felt as I do that we rarely get to taste the movie experience anymore.  Finally...a movie that will satisfy the yearning for a film that will illicit thrills, laughter, tears and moments that take your breath away without the use of artificial special effects.  I know each person will have a review/opinion that speaks to wherever they were in their own journey when they first saw ""The Way"" and that each one will be different.  What WILL be the same, though, will be the inevitable desire to experience this movie...again...and again.

If I had to sum up ""The Way with only one statement"", it would have to be...A beautifully layered journey about love, acceptance and courage. A film experience with an independent budget and a blockbuster soul.",1329782400,4,8360,4.839887640449438

4879328,3,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is a beautiful movie in terms of its cinematography and scenery. It also provides a really wonderful ""feel"" of the region in which it is shot.
It only suffers from one annoying feature, which, unfortunately, is common in a lot of movies: The main character is a really unfriendly, cold and sarcastic person (granted, he has his reasons). However, he seems to attract a number of nice people who want to help him out at the beginning of his journey, and others who want to be with him along his journey, even though he is a jerk to all of them. In real life, people (other than masochists) stay away from jerks.
Hollywood seems to like to play ""fast and loose"" with this concept, and few of the movies with main characters of this ilk ever explain why nice, normal people would be attracted to unfriendly, cold, and sarcastic people.
If this movie were really ""true"" to its spirit, no one would want to be anywhere near this guy, and he would end up making his journey alone - and maybe learn something about his personality in the process.",1329523200,25,1047,4.486910994764398

4879351,1,B005S9ELG2,"The Way was written by Emilio Estevez, starring his father, Martin Sheen.  It's the story of a man whose son dies while making a pilgrimage. The father impulsively decides to complete the trek, along an ancient well-traveled road through Spain.  I wanted to see this movie, because the plot has potential and Martin Sheen is an excellent actor.  There are a couple of flaws with this film which keep it from coming any where close to its potential.  (1) Very thin, almost nonexistent backstory.  Without developing the preceding father-son conflict beyond a bare-bones sketch, it's hard to dredge up empathy for the father's journey.  Of course we are sympathetic that he lost his son, but there needs to be more of a connection in order for the audience to ""Care"" about his journey.  (2) The various characters the father meets along the way seem to have some sort of bond but it doesnt go any where...in other words, how are they transformed by their journey and by each other?  If that answer is in the movie, in any but the most superficial sense, i missed it.  (3) How is the father--after all 99 % of the movie features  him--transformed?  We see a brief glimpse of him wandering around in some ""foreign"" looking market, but what does that mean?  And is it a transformation or just an imitation of the life he thinks his son would have lived? Did the journey heal his grief?  Hard to say. You won't find any clues in the movie.  On the plus side, the scenery is nice.  And there is a cool meeting & party with a gypsy family, which actually seemed to have some promise as a turning point, but then that petered out too.  I'm sorry to say I think Emilio needed a script doctor to turn this vanity film into an actual story.  I'll be interested to hear what others think.",1329436800,21,1775,4.5141065830721

4879354,5,B005S9ELG2,"I watched my own dvd of every photograph which has me in it entitled 'My Life in Pictures 1962 - 2004' before viewing The Way this evening and then settling down to write this appraisal. After viewing my dvd I was struck by how many people I used to be. Not just the faces of me, that I now identify, but the lives I have been. The people who shared. The communities we have been.

As I watched Martin Sheen's journey I was reminded of the journeys I've taken, the smiles I've captured and the warmth which caused me to grow. And the anxieties we leave behind. In the next few weeks I must write a four thousand word essay about 'gated communities' for a degree. There is a writer on Sheen's trek, I little too florid for me but his heart is in the right place, his Irishness has one scene inspired by 'Waiting for Godot.' That's the thing with travelling; it opens the soul to the immediate and now, removing the habits of time and the lie of comforts. Free.

The conceits and the facades are gradually dissipated by the characters who embark upon The Way. Welcomed by strangers each with their own hidden lives, only the impermanence of passing faces brings out our better sides. And, of course, the joy of all that sunshine upon an uncluttered landscape easily frees the mind of shames.

Don't be surprised by all the music. It does travel with you and not always requiring batteries. This is a film about travelling. It may seem to be something of a whim for Tom (Sheen's character) but I understood his reasoning. He had the will, if not the gloves. It is life enhancing, to the point where you can never really be alone again. Some call it by a religion's name. I feel it in each step we take.

What I can not understand is why people build walls around themselves and call it community. The trough gets deeper. Rigid faces are lonely places. There is no written constitution for living. Only life. As best you can.",1328918400,6,1921,4.418079096045198

the peak of the movie was when he put his backpack on the edge of a bridge which immediately fell into the river and he had to swim to get it out of the water.

4879356,4,B005S9ELG2,"The Way is a different kind of movie: thoughtful, personal and emotionally moving.  Martin Sheen plays a successful doctor who is estraneged from his adult, only son (Emilio Estevez).  His son is tragically killed in France in a hiking accident in the Pyrenees.  Sheen's character (Tom) must make the grim, lonely journey to France to identify the body and make arrangements.  This hits the viewer with a very emotional initial setting.  When Tom arrives, he learns that his son was killed while hiking the Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trail that starts in France and ends up in Spain at the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, at the sea.

On a whim, Tom gets some gear and starts walking all by himself.  I, as the viewer, am thinking that it would be the perfect therapy to work out the terrible loss of one's child.  Tom brings his son's ashes in a special box and spreads little bits of them along the trail.  He mystically has visions of his son at various points along the journey.  Tom is a sad, lonely and grieving man when he starts out and Sheen gives a fine acting performance on this!  He bumps into different oddball characters along the way:  an obnoxious Dutchman who is walking to lose weight, a cynical, chain-smoking Canadian woman, and an Irish writer who has immense writer's block.  They, among the other pilgrims, are walking to cleanse themselves, to reflect, and to get inspiration from the deep Christian and spiritual history of the trail.  Tom shuns their companionship at first, but the long and adventurous journey has the effect of ironing out his emotional pain and helping him get back in touch with his fellow human travelers.  Tom has run-ins with a raging river, a band of gypsies, the Spanish police, and his fellow Euro travelers.  Along the journey, the little band of hikers grows to feel like a family.  One of the most moving scenes is when Tom starts opening up his heart to the Irish writer.  And there is always, in this movie, the ever-present feeling of the long, arduous road ahead of them.  When they reach the tomb at the church on the Spanish coast, it is a very moving and emotional culmination of their journey.  The scene in the final Catholic church where the priests are swinging the ""smoker pot"" back and forth is strangely moving, but even more so when Tom sees his son participating as one of the priests.  Tom reaches there a changed man, and he makes the final walk to the sea with his son's final remains.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get in a reflective mood and travel with Tom.  I see in Tom and the other hikers, the desire to tap down into their own intuitive feelings of the 2000-year heritage of Western Christian civilization, the desire to cast off the distracting chaff of life and to narrow one's goal to just walking, pilgramiging, reflecting, praying, surviving and absorbing the surrounding countryside and culture.  I give it a ""4"" only because it may not be for everyone, and besides, ""5"" ratings should be rare.  I want to do a hiking pilgramige some day!",1328659200,8,3065,4.631481481481481
4879357,4,B005S9ELG2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does get a little long, but then again it does an impressive job of showing change in the characters as gradual and realistic.  Some might find watching actors walk a trail for 2 hours boring, but as a former backpacker, I loved the journey.  While it is a story about characters struggling with their Catholic faith, the story resonates across faiths.  Excellent movie for a small budget effort.",1328400000,7,491,4.609195402298851
4879358,4,B005S9ELG2,"So much better than I anticipated. The movie develops its story and the relationships in the story naturally and unhurriedly - any rushing of these relationships would have betrayed the nature of the character Sheen plays and the journey he is on. Every time the story seems about to veer into the maudlin it dodges a bit to the side, remaining truthful and human. The movie is a little about change and a lot about self-acceptance. It won't change your life, but it will likely leave you feeling a bit better about it.",1326240000,11,519,4.591397849462366

When he gets news that his son has died while on a trek in Europe he goes over seas to bring him back home.  Tom's life changes in the process.  This movie surprised the hell out of me.  Watching the preview it made me want to watch it and I thought it was gonna be good but a little slow.  I was dead wrong.  Five minutes in this movie grabs you and doesn't let go.  You wouldn't think a movie about a 60 year old walking for months would be exciting and worth watching but it keeps you watching and interested the entire time.  This movie is extremely emotional and you feel as if you are walking with Tom and willing him to finish for the both of you.  I can go on and on about this movie but all I will say is stop what you are doing and watch this.  You will not be disapointed.  Overall, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

Everyone was talking about it. When I saw it, I fell in love with the story, the beauty of the Spanish countryside, and the genuine, heartfelt portrayals of the four central characters.  This is Martin Sheen at his best in a film for anyone who is looking for a very simple story told in very simple terms. Bravo to Emilio Estevez too for developing a story about people walking on a road and turning it into a sweet, genuine movie.",1325376000,6,599,4.486238532110092

The emotions he feels leads him to an unexpected turn in his life as he sets out to follow the pilgrims' route to Santiago, to make the journey his son was intent on making when he met his untimely end. On his jounrney he meets an array of colourful characters from different backgrounds, countries and walks of life. On the course of their journey an unlikely quartet of misfits become friends and explore their reasons for being on the journey. It's a nicely done little film, and a refreshing change from some of the garbage that makes it onto the screen these days. I think there is a message intended in there somewhere, but it is a charming movie, and one which ill, no doubt, kindle interest in El Camino worldwide. Some of the characters are a bit stereotypical: lecherous Latin types; a jolly, pot-bellied, pot-smoking Dutchman; a daft Irishman; a weird Canadian (aren't they all?)...but the views of Spain are lovely. Liked it. Would watch it again.

I am very satisfied that the movie gets to the core of meaning of the Camino.  And yes, watching this superbly simple and direct movie made me shed some tears of yearning to be back on the Path struggling to reach the next convent or monastery or albergue. But after some time being back in the USA I am realizing the Camino goes on and on and never leaves, magically transforming the mundane into the mystery of The Way. Congrats again to the Sheens.

4879385,5,B005S9ELG2,"I spied my first pilgrim in Conques France a few years ago, then visited Santiago last year and  was completely blown away by the energy of the pilgrims as they made their arrival into the City. I felt as if I had discovered some great secret and wondered how it had been so well kept. I told everyone who would listen about it. So, my surprise and joy was immense when I learned about this movie, and I wondered how it could possibly do justice to the experiences I have read about in ""Field of Stars"" and other accounts, and the gorgeous places I have visited in Spain that are stops along the Camino.

I went with three friends last evening and we simultaneously laughed and teared up from beginning to end. Although it is a compact version of a journey, it is complete as a story and what I appreciate most is the feeling one gets of really being there. People are imperfect, one feels the discomfort of the rough nights, we can feel that the relationships, although temporary, get right down to the core of being in this world. I feel as if I could return to The Way II, III and IV, and keep watching people trekking across France and Spain and share in their varied experiences which all speak to the meaning of life. Oh, yes, the other thing I love is that nothing in this movie pretends to tell you what that is exactly. I think the secret to the success of this movie is that we can see ourselves on that journey, just as confused, hopeful, inspired, frustrated, angered, and on and on, as the characters are that unfold on screen. Do we like them? Would we want to walk with them? Not sure! All part of the fun of the movie. The personal accounts that I have read and heard, all seem to convey this quality.

Finally, if none of this sounds appealing to you, then rest assured that the cinematography and the scenes of Spanish countryside, cities and towns are enough to knock your socks off!",1323561600,12,1902,4.367231638418079
4879386,5,B005S9ELG2,"At a time in my life when I have been growing quite cynical about the future of cinema and film making, 3 movies this year have worked to restore my faith in our ability to make great movies, and I hope they portend a glimpse into the future of this, my favorite art form.

In recent months, I've been treated to not just one, but three deeply moving film treats. 127 Hours, The Kings Speech, and this movie, ""The Way"" which is my favorite of all. These movies are all powerful and dense in content and emotion, without the use of gratuitous sex or violence. They are adult, real, frank, and thought provoking, without being twisted or gross.

These are three completely different movies, from three different directors, and with very different subject matter. Their only common thread is that they are simply good. Very good. Films like these are the reason I fell in love with the movies so very many years ago. The one which zeroed in on my individual heart though, even among these three great films, was ""The Way"".

There are plenty of great reviews here about the specifics of the film, and I encourage you to read enough of them to pump you up to see it, but don't try to find out too much about the movie. How it unfolds, etc.. The movie itself can be a mini pilgrimage. Just go, knowing you will enjoy it more than Twilight Part X, and let your self be vulnerable to this beautiful movie.

This film is a chance for you to have a 2 hour mini-pilgrimage of your own. To reflect on your own journey in life, whatever form that it taking. To suffer, die, and be reborn in a brief afternoon at your local multiplex, and to give a knowing smile, and wink from time to time, and to laugh as well. In short, this masterpiece by Emilio Estevez takes you skillfully through all the stages that happen on real pilgrimage. It's brilliant on every level. It's writing cuts straight to the heart. The editing is perfect, the cinematography gorgeous, and the characters are extraordinarily real, whether they make you cringe, or want to give them a hug, or both, (which is usually the case with not only these characters, but all the real people we meet in our lives). This is us in miniature. All of us. Captured by a master craftsman.

I'll actually be hurt, if the academy doesn't recognize this truly amazing film. I'm not sure if it fits the typical Oscar M.O., but if it doesn't, then the academy is blind. I want this film to do very well, in all regards. It's what we need in Hollywood. It's time. We've done enough of the same old thing to last us a life time. How about a steady stream of gems, and genuine works of personal love, such as this being offered on many more screens, than CGI sterility and vampire soap operas.

This is one to savor, and let it have it's way with you emotionally. There was literally not a dry eye in the (sadly underpopulated) theater my wife and I went to. One of only two screens in this city of hundreds, to be showing the best movie out right now, hands down.",1322006400,30,2999,4.394594594594595

Not an expert---- I don't know if it was the music, the visual imagery, the script, acting or directing?  It just all went into the mix and out came out simply special.

It is difficult to capture and communicate the essence of the Camino de Santiago in a way that one can fully appreciate its impact and significance.  Emilio Estivez has achieved just that and at the same time made it entertaining for all of us!  Having walked the Camino I can attest to its powerful effect.  This movie uplifts the spirit.  In many ways it is simply a celebration of life!

To Sharron A. Hammer and Tucson:  You must walk the Camino.  It will impact your life so profoundly in ways you can never imagine.
