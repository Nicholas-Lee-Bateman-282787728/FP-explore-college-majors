2056709,4,B00022FW4U,"Bus 174 was hijacked in June of 2000 on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by Sandro di Nascimento, a young man who was one of the so called invisible street people living in the city.  Almost immediately hoards of police and television crews appeared on the scene. Approximately 35 million Brazilians watched on TV as the dramatic events of the hijacking were captured on film and transmitted to the public.

The fact that this event was being televised appears to have influenced the strategy of the police to control the situation and negotiate the release of the hostages. Instead of taking action to resolve the problem, the police talked aimlessly with Sandro for several hours as he ranted and raved, threatened to kill various passengers, made demands of the authorities, and in the end left the bus with a young woman tightly in his grasp as he pointed a handgun to her head.  What followed was an all too predicatable series of events that left both the young woman and Sandro dead.

If this factual documentation of the events of the Bus 174 tragedy were the entire story, this film would not have generated the notoriety it has received.  Fortunately, director Jose Padilha realized that a much bigger story needed to be told.  Consequently, he skillfully includes background material about Sandro and the so called invisible street people who roam the streets of Rio de Janeiro.

The invisible ones start out like Sandro as young children with no place to go and no one to care for them.  They live by wandering the streets searching for something to steal.  They sleep in cardboard shelters, if they are lucky, or huddled together in nooks and crannies of public buildings or churches.  The police regularly kill them or incarcerate them, often without trial, in the most dreadful prisons where they are jammed together in oppressive heat without even the most basic sanitary facilities.  The general public in Brazil does not seem to be much concerned that streeet children are regularly being beaten, imprisoned, and killed.  In fact, it seems as if some portion of the ruling class would prefer that the police kill more of these unfortunate children.  Viewers will find it hard to consider Brazil a civilized country after watching Bus 174.

The story is about Sandro, but it is clear that the hopelessness and despair that resulted in his futile and crazy behavior might just as well have been perpetrated by hundreds of street people just like him.  The beautiful beaches of Rio and the thousands of rich tourists who flock to them stand in stark contrast to the desperate children who roam their fringes watching for a chance to steal a part of the dream they can see but not touch.

Sandro's dream was more modest -- a home and family with a job to support himself.  As the film suggests, he had no hope of realizing his ambitions.  This documentary never condones his behavior, but helps us to understand the anger and rage that prompts it.",1093305600,40,2967,4.784313725490196
2056710,4,B00022FW4U,"Part documentary and part social criticism, BUS 174 investigates the hijacking of Bus 174 by one of the ""invisible"" street children of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2000. After witnessing the brutal death of his mother Sandro leaves the slum to fend for himself. Pursuing a life of crime and desperation he alternates between running with his street gang and being incarcerated in the harsh dilapidated Rio jails. Beaten by police and despised and deemed worthless by the general public, street children like Sandro live a meager existence with little hope of a viable future.

 This film performs a thorough investigation into Sandro's background as well as the state of street children in general. A Brazilian sociologist includes intriguing insights into the state of the ""invisibles"" and their dire predicaments. It quickly becomes apparent that Sandro is a product of his environment; the Rio society created a criminal through their neglect and lack of compassion.

 If you enjoyed CITY OF GOD, or documentaries in general, I recommend this film.",1091059200,3,1048,5.183431952662722

2056712,5,B00022FW4U,"If you like the film ""Dog Day Afternoon"" then you'll love this. Powerful docu-drama about the events that transpired on June 12 of 2000 in Brazil, where a homeless person under the influence of drugs, decided to hijack a bus and detain 11 passengers as hostages on a 4 and a half hour ordeal which was telecast live on Brazilian tv. The result is much better than an action film.",1090454400,3,379,4.428571428571429
2056713,5,B00022FW4U,"This film often does pull its viewer in different directions. At times you feel so angry at Sandro, but his background makes you consider the many facets of the society that breeds such street people. The massacre of the street kids was especially horrendous, and I think they give the event fair representation in this documentary. I think that the filmmakers tried very hard to remain unbiased while criticizing a government that does not always work. As a few people have mentioned, this is a very long documentary, but I personally think that it needs to be this long to do the story justice. Overall, it is very poignant and heart wrenching, but in the end it will make you reconsider the way that society isolates specific groups of people, and it may cause you to question the way you yourself profile people.",1322524800,,816,4.713286713286713
2056714,3,B00022FW4U,"I am ambivalent about this movie.  I can't really say if I'd recommend it, despite its strengths.  But let me start with those.

1) It tells a gripping story.  I repeatedly thought of it as a true-to-life version of Dog Day Afternoon.
2) It gives powerful background information on the hijacker, which deepens the film dramatically.
3) The hijacker is simultaneously the film's main protagonist and antagonist, which is a powerful cinematic coup.
4) In this vein, this movie shows how a vile, violent criminal can also be a gentle, compassionate soul at the same time.  So true!
5) It details a stunning level of corruption, horror, poverty, bureaucratic incompetence, and wide-scale tragedy in Brazil.
6) It shows glimpses of real human beauty, such as when Sandro gets ""adopted"" as an adult by a kindly poor woman in the favela.  This was touching, and made me cry.
7) Fantastic cinematography (by the news crews, mostly).  So many good video shots.
8) There was a tight logic to the story.  The juxtaposition of the bus tragedy and interviews and historical information really worked.

But now the weaknesses, and they are few, but to me, potent:

1)  The film was simply too long.  Many of the points, especially in the interviews and historical segments were made so repeatedly that I found myself bored, and did a bit of fast-forwarding.  A good half-hour (that is, about a quarter of the film) could have been shaved off.

2) The film's context was too small.  The film's social message -- that Brazil lets so many street children fall through its cracks, or even pushes them through the cracks, and thus is directly responsible for the havoc they later wreak -- was insufficient, and I found it wholly unsatisfying.  Yes, everything they said was true, but I crave a much bigger message and get tired of films that tackles major social issues and fall short.

The implication from this film is that if we just solve the problem of street children, by giving them better social programs and better rehabilitation, and by training the police better, then all will be well.  What a farce.  Out-of-control street child are a symptom of an infected fingertip, yet the whole hand is rotten.  And Brazil is only a hand; the rest of the world is the arm and body, and that's rotten too.

Questions regarding the bigger picture:  Why are so many people having children so mindlessly?  What about overpopulation?  What about the idea that everyone, Brazilian or otherwise, to varying degrees, are abusing and neglecting their children?  Can we not see that our whole world is teetering on the edge of destruction, and that we are all causing it?",1296691200,5,2643,4.807095343680709
2056715,5,B00022FW4U,"Bus 174 is a tense and suspenseful documentary that involves a hostage takeover of a city bus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  On June 12th, 2000, a young man named Sandro Nascimento, with a troubled past as a street kid, hijacked a street bus terrorizing the passengers.  Plenty of film footage was available, footage that was powerful, dramatic and sad.  The film is lengthy, at 150 minutes, but it keeps the viewer on the edge.  It is interspersed with lengthy broadcast footage of the event and contains interviews with those who were related to Nascimento, those who knew him and his troubled past, the response team, former street kids, etc.

When he was a child, Sandro do Nascimento witnessed his  mother stabbed to death during a robbery.  From there, he became a street kid, surviving the brutality of the police, sniffing glue, and stay alive.  Living on the streets, during the early 90s, he survived a massacre of street kids by the police.  The DVD contains excellent commentary by Director  Jos&eacute; Padilha on how he went about to get the footage from Global TV, how to get the hostages to recount the stories, how to weave in personal interviews from family, police, inhumane conditions at the prisons, street life, etc.

You will get a clear picture of the culture of violence in Rio de Janeiro, the treatment of street kids, the corrupt police.  It is said that those who apply for police jobs are at their last resort for a job, poorly trained, and with low self esteems.  The worse is the inhumane prison/jail conditions.

The tense moments during the hostage takeover finally comes to an end, as the viewer has plenty of questions during the ordeal.

There are too many Sandros in Brazil, children born into violence, surviving with violence and dying in violent means.  It's clear, Sandro had dreams, but society does not let him achieve those dreams.  This is a powerful, graphic drama.  Don't miss the Special Feature with the Director.  .....Rizzo",1285804800,,1971,4.829850746268657
2056716,4,B00022FW4U,"Bus 174 (nibus 174): 7 out of 10: Sandro is the name of our protagonist in Bus 174. The film is the latest in a long line of documentaries dealing with the street children of Brazil. This documentary is simply the cream of the crop. Using actual footage of a hostage crisis where Sandro takes a municipal bus hostage the film creates great tension for the viewer. (Especially American viewers like me who have no idea how this turns out.)

Interspersed between scenes of the hostage crisis are talking head interviews (a mixed bag from fascinating like Sandro's Aunt to annoying such as Sandro's social worker). Most fascinating is the sheer volume of footage from Sandro's street life before the crisis. The Documentary filmmakers really went out of their way to dig up these treasures.

The documentary is not without flaws however. The sheer volume of people who helped Sandro out in his young life undercuts the whole street kid premise of the film. The middle third does drag as many have noted and there is a horribly misjudged scene in a jail where prisoners shout out their grievances. (Shot in the negative like the monster vision from a mid-nineties creature feature it is a clear fabrication as the filmmakers were denied access to the actual jail in question. It is unnecessary and kills the mood like that Trey Parker style cartoon in Bowling for Columbine).

Those overall minor flaws aside this is one fascinating documentary that truly takes you into another world. Despite cursing and brief male nudity I would recommend this to every high school history class to see how the third world really lives.",1267833600,,1618,4.833935018050542
2056717,5,B00022FW4U,"Rare that you're allowed to decide for yourself after something so powerful.
This is a true story, and a well done documentary.
Watch it if you truly want to discover why Brazilians seem so open and friendly, and talkative. They have their issues, but nothing is not so bad (as would be covered by other western media) that can't be discussed and possibly solved amongst themselves with honesty.
I have many friends in Brazil who remember this incident and some (just like the sorer parts of our history) do not like to remember. The good thing about this film, however, is it does not show a bias from either point of view while detailing how the tragic events of that day came to unravel.
If you live in a western nation these days it's very hard not to try and listen openly to both sides (whether you agree our not) without having political rhetoric shoved down your throat. Even if the issue discussed isn't political in nature. So the Brazilians sharing this info let the audience make up their minds what should be done about issues of poverty, media, crime, corruption, and social inequality yet they still were able to let those involved and deeply effected share their opinions as well. Truly effective.",1260230400,,1213,4.699530516431925
2056718,4,B00022FW4U,"This is perhaps the most honest documentary I have ever seen. It portrays with actual footage and post-facto interviews a tragic and sad event that is unfortunately not an isolated incident in Rio de Janeiro. Bus robberies and burnings are somewhat common, but, this particularly incident and the choices the drug addicted homeless robber and the police made turned this into a notorious national incident. The filmaker explores the lives of homeless children who grow up without any parents or role models in Brazil, drug addiction to pasta basica and inhalants by those street kids and what led up to the robbery of the bus. The filmmaker does not apologize for or attempt to rationalize the horrible actions committed by the homeless robber but explores the sad social conditions that create such a situation and individual. The filmmaker then explores and interviews the police involved in the incident and explores why police in Brazil have a reputation for violence, how being a policeman in Rio's favelas is nearly equivalent to serving in a war zone and how that contributed to the incident. For anyone interested in Brazil, a fascinating country that is an emerging economic super-power, this film also points out the tremendous amounts of work Brazil needs to do in improving its social and security conditions as it joins the developed world.",1256601600,,1353,5.071748878923767
2056719,4,B00022FW4U,"Very good documentary that I think could have used a bit of editing to make it let's say 20 % shorter. This movie provides a very interesting insight into modern Brazil and its problems. I felt simultaneously sorry and also mad and annoyed at almost everyone in this movie. The cops seemed mostly incompetent (with some exceptions), the bad guys and street kids are sorry and you feel sorry for them. At the same time, you get mad at them. I have been accosted by these street kids in France and it is the same crap and they are very annoying. At the same time, they are sad and you feel sorry for them.

This movie obviously takes the position that people are swept up in events and in broad psychological currents that carry them along and they have little control. In essence, that is maybe a Marxist or post-MArxist theme. I prefer to think that every person redefines himself and can make choices. If you read Shakespeare or Budhhism, the notion is that we constantly redefine our Selves a-new. So I have a hard time buying this idea that we are predetermined to crime. Also, one of the most important books on criminology of the past 50 years was Samenow's ""Inside the Criminal Mind"". I suggest that anyone who sees this movie familiarize himself with Samenow's theories. He says that criminals, far from being ""victims of society"", are just people who, at an early age, decide that ""the rules do not apply to them"", and that they are outside the rules. If you look at this movie in that light, it provides a different take on this.

It is still a very powerful and moving film. It would be a very hard person who could not watch this movie and not almost be crying (I felt like crying several times). But I also think that we need to step back and not fall into the ""society is to blame"" stuff. Or maybe it is both. Maybe the criminal is to blame, and also society.",1236729600,,1872,4.423188405797101

2056721,3,B00022FW4U,"This film is the story of a desperate act and it's protagonist.
The story jumps between the dramatic kidnapping of a line bus in Rio and the past of the perpetrator Sandro. Avoiding moral judgments the filmmaker finds the right angle to open our eyes on a dramatic reality we often tend to thrust aside or romanticize. While the stock footage and some shots (the intro is one of the longest and most incredible helicopter shots ever) visually perfectly stick together, the interviews sections in between feel a little poor.

More than anything else, the film posits, Sandro feels forgotten and invisible- he wants to be recognized, wants others to feel and acknowledge his anger at being discarded and neglected for so long.

Bus 174 is an excellent film in its own right (well directed and edited, etc).  But it will certainly prove educational in my class.  The film asks the viewer to consider to what extent the state is responsible for lawlessness when lawlessness is a result of the desperation that springs from poverty and social marginalization.  Given insufficiently trained police and their resultant tendency toward brutality, and a criminal detention system in which prisoners live under inhumane conditions, how can anything but anger and violence amongst prisoners and ex-convicts result?

2056729,5,B00022FW4U,"This documentary chronicles the hijacking of a bus by a drugged and desperate Sandro Rosa do Nascimento, who upon realizng the national spectacle that he is causing, begins to create a drug-influenced show that mixes criminal bravado, important social commentary, and terror that exposes some of the weaknesses of Brazil.

It turns out that this hijacking became the most infamous crime in Sao Paulo's history, if not the whole of Brazil's.

When we examine his past, it turns out that Sando do Nascimento was a survivor of the ""Candelaria Massacre"" which occured seven years earlier. In this, the police took revenge on homeless kids by converging and firing on them while they slept, killing seven of them.

That event was PREVIOUSLY the most infamous crime in Brazil's memory.

The fact that Nascimento came from that tragedy to create the next big one, topped by the fact that during the siege he actually MENTIONED the killing of his friends at Candelaria, and his witnessing the murder of his mother at a young age, and his phrasing, ""Brazil, check this out"" & ""How can you let someone with such a pretty face die?"" hit me as this whole criminal act having a higher meaning in Brazil society.

It was as if this whole thing occurred to motivate the government and people of Brazil to do much more to try easing the social ills and unequality. That pretending that these things don't happen and that the problems of certain people don't exist will only create ticking time bombs that will eventually begin to constantly explode directly in their faces instead of somewhere ""out of sight"", where it is preferred. Actually, I am suprised that the result of this was not much worse.

It's horrible that an innocent life was lost during this, and its just as sad that the government hasn't done much since to help more at-risk individuals from completely going off the deep end like Nascimento.",1148774400,3,1895,4.815384615384615
2056730,4,B00022FW4U,"""On July 12, 2000, the Rio de Janeiro police trapped a man who was trying to rob a bus. He took eleven hostages, and the local SWAT team was called. This incident became known in Brazil as the Bus 174 affair"". That is the way in which this Brazilian documentary, directed by Jose Padilha and Felipe Lacerda, begins.

Truth to be told, I was afraid it was going to be too violent. I wasn t wrong, but there is much more to ""Bus 174"" than violence. This documentary includes live footage regarding what happened, but also interviews with street kids that knew Sandro, the man who ended up as the main protagonist of this tragedy. He didn t have a purpose, he didn t ask for anything, he just was stopped in the middle of a robbery and ended up trapped in a situation he couldn t handle.

The documentary allows us to be witnesses to Sandro s life, and to the events that would take him from his home, to the streets, a reformatory, prison and finally bus 174. Some interviews with a social worker, a sociologist, a journalist and the mediator that worked in this case allow to shed more light on this event, and on Sandro s life. For example, we learn that Sandro never knew his father, and that he witnessed the murder of his mother at a young age. After that, he ran away from his home and started living in the streets, joining a gang of ""meninos da rua"". Sandro was also one of the survivors of the ""Candelaria massacre"" of children that lived in the street, that happened in the early 1990 s. He escaped violent death, only to find it later, in a different way.

In general, I think that the directors are trying to point out that the reason why Sandro, a victim of the ""Candelaria massacre"", became the perpetrator of another tragedy is not circumstantial, but has to do with a system that allows many children to be invisible to those that are well off, until the children grow and confront them with violence. In my opinion, that conclusion may be pertinent for Brazil, but it is also relevant for many other countries. Social exclusion and disregard are never valid answers.

All in all, highly recommended.

2056731,2,B00022FW4U,"While living in Rio I once asked my Marine Corps buddy Paul Y- why he thought Brazil never could get ahead.  He pondered for a moment then said: ""Brazil is the only country that respects sociologists.""  I didn't fully appreciate what he meant until I saw Bus 174, a film loaded with the blatherings of sociologists and social workers explaining the root causes of why SPOILER ALERT a glue-sniffing, cocaine-snorting, fugitive thief named Sandro shot and killed an innocent girl on a Rio bus in a botched holdup.

Then I understood.  When you've got a Constitution that says no one under 18 can be held criminally liable for anything (Article 228), you come to realize that you're in the grips of a sociological experiment gone horribly, horribly awry, that you're living in a nightmare of supremely stupid paternalistic sixties' utopianism, in a society with prescriptions for social problems wholly unconnected to reality or actual human behavior.  Watch this film and you'll see this ethos in its full twisted glory, from a bogus examination of root causes, to dimestore Freudian psychology, to neo-Marxist analysis.  Ironically, it's that last analysis that really has any traction.  Poor kids got to eat too, and if they steal to get food, it's at least understandable (c.f. Prov. 6:30).  When you steal to buy cocaine, however, then my compassion ends, as does the compassion of most people who are grounded in reality and common sense.

In short, look for a lot of handwringing SPOILER ALERT about why a young man would go nuts and kill a hostage, interspersed with victim, relative and police testimonials that are interesting and sometimes informative.  The incompetence of the police in the situation is staggering.  They must have had 50 chances for a perfect head shot and never took it.  What a disgrace for all concerned.  SPOILER ALERT As for the fact that the cops who suffocated Sandro beat the rap, well that's why jury nullification was invented.

Since we're on this same general subject, may I share a true confession with you?  First, some background.  I was an observer to the precursor to the Candelaria Massacre.  Because I didn't have a car at the time, twice a week I walked from Ilha das Cobras through Praca Pio X (where the Candelaria Church is located) to get to the...well, to get to a building located on Av. Presidente Wilson.  On July 23, 1993, I happened to be walking through Pio X in the afternoon and saw the commotion as the cops rounded up a bunch of kids while others taunted the cops and threw rocks at the patty wagon.  That of course was the genesis of the cops' determination for payback later that night.  My confession: before the massacre walking through Pio X scared the hell out of me because of all the street kids, one of whom I once saw stealing an old man's watch off his wrist.  Walking through Pio X after the massacre, I never feared for my safety again.  Infer from my confession what you will.",1138924800,13,2952,4.758349705304519

ANYway, I showed this video to my criminal justice class and we did a compare/contrast to the shootings at Columbine high school. Emotions in the class ranged from frustration to anger to sadness and students left the room talking about it!

Although the film may be viewed as biased, there is no question to reality when one sees the interior of the jails and the treatment of the inmates, learns of the lack of training and sees it in the Rio PD, and observes the street kids as they huddle on cement in shabby blankets, sniff paint & glue from a plastic bottle, and don worn clothing with American sports logos. It is gritty, it is suspenseful, it is dark and eye-opeing and everything you would want in a documentary. The needless waste of human beings, the surreal world outside of the US and inside of a Rio jail, and the videos of the streets where ""Sergio"" survived is in your face without being preachy or judgemental.

When the robbery turned sour, Sandro, the perpetrator, turned the driver and the passengers into hostages, threatening to kill them one by one if his demands weren't met.  Carried live on Brazilian television, the event garnered national attention as the tense standoff between Sandro and the police played itself out.  ""Bus 174,"" a riveting documentary by Jose Padilha and Felipe Lacerda, is an account of that event.

Not content to merely rehash the details of that day's experience, the filmmakers use their film as an opportunity to examine many of the social ills that laid the groundwork for the tragedy in the first place.  The harshest criticism is reserved for the Brazilian government and the Brazilian people who look the other way when it comes to the hundreds of homeless children living on the crowded streets of Rio de Janeiro.  Sandro was himself such a child, having witnessed the murder of his mother at a young age then turning to street life and street crime as his only means of survival.  We learn that not only is the plight of such people routinely ignored by the vast majority of Rio's residents, but that both citizens and government officials have taken a proactive part in harassing and, in some cases, even killing these children.  Sandro is clearly a product of his environment, and his actions on that day largely extend from the lack of a societal connection he's felt all his life.  The directors also take swipes at an incompetent, corrupt police force, a brutal, dehumanizing prison system, and a sensation-seeking, voyeuristic public who feeds on the unfolding live tragedy as if it were a Hollywood action movie or some kind of lurid scripted drama.

Interwoven with footage from the actual incident are interviews with various participants in the drama, ranging from police officials to SWAT team members to surviving hostages to tortured prisoners to social workers to psychologists to friends and relatives of Sandro himself.  Through these interviews, Padilha and Lacerda weave a tapestry of Brazilian society that spares no one and indicts us all in one way or another.  What is most impressive about ""Bus 174"" is how our emotions get all tied up in a knot, as we find our loyalties shifting back and forth between the various participants in the drama.  At one moment we sympathize with Sandro and all the suffering he's experienced, and the next with the innocent hostages who simply want to escape this madman and return to their normal lives.  At times, we find ourselves rooting for the befuddled cops, while at others, we are inclined to side with the downtrodden and see the law enforcement officials as the true villains of the piece.

The events that occurred on that day shook a nation, serving as a wakeup call for a society that has attempted to sweep its injustices and social ills under a blood-stained carpet.  Yet, this isn't a situation unique to Rio, by any means, for Sandro's story is representative of what happens in all major cities when poverty and misery are allowed to go unchecked and when indifference to suffering becomes the norm of the privileged classes.  ""Bus 174"" is more than just a recounting of an isolated incident; it is a glimpse into the dark heart of Man that we all ignore at our own peril.",1101168000,44,3382,4.831889081455806

As events unfold on the bus, we visit children in the area to see how they live - no home, no food, no blankets. Ignored and abused, they have no choice but crime to get money for food. No one seems to care. In fact, a radio survey shows that most people want to ""kill the kids and clean the city.""

The jail situation is so bad that prisoners say they would rather be dead. How are you going to get someone to give up the hostages when he knows what is awaiting him.

It ends badly.",1384473600,,732,4.069444444444445

What is it with the film world these days, that any movie about Brazilian favelas is immediately hailed as a gritty masterpiece?  There are plenty of sucky movies about Brazilian favelas:  this is one.

It just goes on and on.  I mean, we get it.  The life of these poor kids is miserable, jail is horrific, and the police mistreat them.  This should have been just a 10-minute short or so:  do we really need to see every inch of footage and be treated to a blow-by-blow account of the incident?  Then he stood her up . . . then she started crying . . . then he seemed to feel bad . . . then he asked for some cheeseburgers, etc.

Sheesh.  Other than ""life blows when you're a poor kid in Brazil,"" the only insight this film conveys is that the Brazilian special forces are completely inept and incapable of dealing with a hostage situation.",1328832000,,867,4.283950617283951
