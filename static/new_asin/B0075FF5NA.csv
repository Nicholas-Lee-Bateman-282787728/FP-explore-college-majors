5057182,5,B0075FF5NA,Carol Channing is one of the most engaging multi-talented stars in show business.  This DVD is very interesting because Carol Channing is a delightful show business icon.  You'll enjoy watching and listening to her stories.  Other stars also offer wonderful tributes to Ms. Channing.  I didn't know a lot about Carol Channing.  After seeing this DVD I will seek other DVDs and CDs with Carol Channing.  I recommend this DVD highly.  You won't be disappointed!,1344297600,,459,5.04
5057183,5,B0075FF5NA,"a GREAT ""must have"" for any Broadway/celebrity/Musical Comedy lover. Miss Channing is in her 90's and is seen, singing and dancing(?), telling stories, and being ""Miss Channing"" like no other.  The stories and memories are astonishingly BRILLIANT...as are the rare and sometimes forgotten glimpses at why she is a legend!!  :-)",1343174400,,327,5.392156862745098

5057185,5,B0075FF5NA,"What an amazing documentary of an amazing actress! This film follows Carol around as she gets ready to go onstage again after 16 years for an AIDS benefit. Her Dollly 'Boys' are there to help her along and so is a long lost love - just try not tearing up when he talks about how he wanted to come up to her when he saw her outside a theatre and didn't - Carols ""Oh you should have!"" tugs at the heart strings.

Still going strong at her age is also a gret example for all of us! As the song saysw ""Look at the old girl now fellas"" and we must!",1342224000,6,543,3.891891891891892
5057186,5,B0075FF5NA,"I have been a fan of Carol Channings since I  was a teen and my Mom and I saw her in the 1970's production of HELLO DOLLY on broadway. She had broken her arm the night before, but as they say "" the show must go on"". She and the show were FAB; at the end of the performance she came back out  and sat on the edge of the stage and told us all of the misadventure that left her with the broken arm. I bet everyone in that theatre felt as I did...that  she was talking directly to me! ...and She was my friend!
That is a rare gift indeed..as is this documentary. If you are a fan of Miss
Channing or of the broadway theater...BUY THIS CD",1340236800,4,633,3.853846153846154
5057187,5,B0075FF5NA,"Say the words ""Hello Dolly"" to anyone over 40 years old and they answer either ""Carol Channing"" or ""Louis Armstrong"". While Armstrong's single version of the title song from the Jerry Herman-penned Broadway smash hit was the first record to knock the Beatles from the #1 position on the record charts, it was Actress/Comedienne Channing who WAS Dolly and created the role on Broadway.

I knew Channing from Dolly as well as her TV appearances but I didn't know much about her - until watching this 89-minute 2011 documentary by Dori Berinstein and it's wonderful bonus scenes. Now I am not only in love with Channing (who just turned 90!) but am enthralled with her compassion, wittiness and support for arts in the schools.

Berinstein follows Channing on visits to schools, to have her star placed in the Walk of Fame in Palm Springs (who knew there was such a thing with over 300 stars) and rides in a limo with Channing and her current husband Harry Kullijian. If nothing else grabs your heart in watching this film, it will be Channing's relationship with Harry. They met when they were both 12 years old and dated into high school. They then went there separate ways, with Harry still having a passion for Carol. Each got married: Harry for 60 years and Carol for more than 40 (to a man who literally stole everything from her when they divorced.) After Harry's wife died they reconnected at a Channing book -signing and fell in love again and got married. No two people could be more in love.

For theater fans there is a wealth of rare archival footage (the end credits go on for quite a while) and interviews with everyone from Lily Tomlin to Bob Mackie to Phyllis Diller (did you know Diller played Dolly on Broadway). The nearly 90-minutes literally flies by and you will nearly always have a smile on your face watching the film.

The bonus section adds another 49 minutes. These are not really ""deleted scenes"" but ""supplemental chapters"" There are 15 of them and not a dud in the bunch. You will probably get a lump in your throat, as I did, when you hear Barbara Walters tell the story of Channing and Walters' mentally-challenged older sister and laugh out loud when Channing describes the song she performed at Joan Crawford's wedding.

This DVD belongs in every Broadway theatre collection. Seek it out. You won't be sorry.

5057191,5,B0075FF5NA,"That's right -- I have yet to immerse myself in this documentary, for as I write these words on May 5, 2012, its scheduled release date is May 22.

Carol Channing is an American treasure, a once-in-a-generation (if that often) performer.  She doesn't simply light up a room; she graciously provides it with a supernova.

Her stage presence is legendary; if she happens to play anywhere near a cemetery, its residents know she's there.  I've seen her in ""Hello, Dolly!"" three times.  Not only does she make that role her own; she embraces it, caresses it, shapes and molds it to utter perfection.

""Carol Channing -- Larger Than Life"" simply cannot help to be anything but phenomenal.",1336176000,6,683,4.794871794871795

The secobd purpose was to let us have a a visual reminder of what this gracious lady has done to entertain us over the years and
how she got there in the first place.  Enough to say that this disc is a collector's  for those who treasure the work of this comedienne
and for the rest of us, a constant reminder we can bring out when we want a bi of a laugh again.

5057208,5,B0075FF5NA,"Ok, I admit it I never was a big fan of Carol Channing. I found her annoying at best.  Well, after watching this documentary I have changed my opinion.  Carol is whitty, charming, and definitely Larger than Life as said in the title.  I didn't know what the documentary would be about but was pleasantly surprised by how down to earth Carol is.  I also enjoyed hearing her story of reconnecting with her grammar school sweetheart she hadn't seen in 70 years!  THey end up getting married and live happily every after.( until he passed away last year).  Carol was married to her previous husband for over 40 years and said he was mean to her.  So good for her, she got to enjoy this final chapter of her life with the man she loved and got away from the other mean guy.  She is very unusual and eccentric which I found endearing.  Nobody that knows her says anything negative about her.  She's a great lady.  Now would I buy her cd's and listen to her sing....heck no.  But this documentary takes you behind the scenes of Carol's nomadic life on the road doing shows like Hello Dolly. It also does some great interviews with stars like JoAnne Worley, Debbie Reynolds, Tippi Hedrin, Loni Anderson, and Chita Rivera, just to name a few.  Great seeing so many old familiar faces and hear their stories about Carol.  So if you want to have a good laugh and see an eccentric legend of the stage definitely catch this outstanding documentary. Jim :)",1361232000,2,1442,4.496153846153846
5057209,5,B0075FF5NA,"I've always been aware of Carol Channing throughout my adult life, but never really caught her on Broadway or really paid a great deal of attention to her professionally.  But after seeing this wonderful documentary I feel the loss was definitely mine.  What an amazing woman with an even more amazing story!  And the icing on the cake is her relationship to her beloved husband.  I'd give this ten stars if I could.  I absolutely loved it!!!",1357862400,,442,4.688311688311688
5057210,5,B0075FF5NA,"Well, whether you're a fan or not, you have to admit, Carol has had decades of success and full houses. Some of the after show comments never change, but even in her 90's she is still growing, she's still glowing and she's still going strong. From Lorelei, to Dolly, good golly, she keeps packing them in and bri9nging them to their feet. She has given us the perfect funeral song, RE: The Johnstown Flood, in, ""This is a Darn Fine Funeral"", she has given us guts, in ""Switchblade Bess"", and she's taught us how to dance with both, ""The Yahoo Step"" & ""Dancing"" She's put on more miles than most Secretaries of State, she's performed for Kings and Queens, with dozens of well know leading men. She even lent her talents and voice to President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 reelection, with, ""HELLO, LYNDON"". She's sold Kitty Litter, Diamonds, Gimbels, furs, and dozens of other items. She has never flinched when tossing dozens of Diamond rings to eager fans, though, usually fake, she did throw one out the a fan at a GIMBELS special event, in 1972, while doing a GIMBELS promo, while here to perform in 4 shows at the Wisconsin State Fair. On her very first show at the Wisconsin State fair Park, it poured with lightening and thunder. No matter, trouper that she is, she moved the show to a huge tent. Devoid of Electric power after lightening struck a transformer, on she went, she needed no POWER, she provided her own. The review the next day read, ""Incandescent CAROL, using her own Dynamo goes on despite power outage  and blows the roof off the tent with her voice and showmanship"" And it's all here including many hard to find clips of that dazzling ""HELLO,DOLLY!"" title number, and in full color. It's so nice to see that performance somewhat preserved, though in just parts, it and CAROL are NATIONAL TREASURES!  Thanks for all the years of entertainment!",1355788800,3,1861,4.6534954407294835
