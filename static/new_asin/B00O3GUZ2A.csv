8681851,1,B00O3GUZ2A,"Very disappointing. Picture quality is horrible; no attempt to sharpen or adjust lighting of the print appears to have been made. Subtitles are few and too far between; not fluent in Yiddish, I often can't tell what's going on. Quality is well below the Ergo Media releases from the same period.",1462147200,,295,4.803921568627451
8681852,4,B00O3GUZ2A,Nice bit of nostalgia.  Only criticism is that not all the dialog was translated into English.,1458518400,,94,4.875
