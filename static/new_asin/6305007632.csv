965957,1,6305007632,"I bought this for my oldest son, a golfer who enjoyed Conway when he was a kid.  It was very disappointing.  I forgot how sexest that era was!  It was just not amusing, especially the Golf Bible segment.  Lord!  I am getting old!",1121817600,3,229,4.232558139534884
965958,5,6305007632,"When I first saw Tim Conway in his character role as 'Dorf' on the Carol Burnette Show I thought I'd die with laughter. I wonder if Randy Newman got the idea for 'Short People' from some of Conway's wild routines. His wacky, insane skits of Dorf is a memorable classic. In this video 'Dorf on Golf' Dorf shows us how to play golf. Oh, my! Really? Tahew! Tahew! Tahew! (thank you, Mr. Tuddball) He teaches us to drive, putt-putt and find the 19th hole? His assistant doesn't have a clue what he's doing either. It's a laugh a minute! Also for the fisherman/woman there is a companion video, 'Dorf Goes Fishing.' I'd say forget about the Pesci/Glover film, 'Gone Fishin'.' Go for this! Alot of Conway's natural comic genius can make any dull moment funny. Alot of that was his later work with Don Knotts. Remember 'The Apple Dumpling Gang,' 'Private Eyes' and Prize Fighter.' This has got to Conway's funniest character ever. All his Dorf videos on Golf, Fishing, Baseball, Auto Racing and the Olympic Games are classics to treasure. It's good clean comedy you won't feel guilty in owning.",1057536000,16,1087,4.696335078534031
