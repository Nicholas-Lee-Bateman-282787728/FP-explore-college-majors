We have one of the ""Spin"" planet travel series narrated by Dudley Moore and we were super looking forward to some more.
They are great for road trips.  You learn all kinds of travel trivia as you drive along.
After the product did not arrive and Amazon was useless at contacting the seller, I did not order from Amazon for a long time because I did not trust them.  We had to charge back the money for the video set because it just never arrived.
We needed VHS because the entertainment system in our F150 still uses VHS.
Stear clear of this reseller, they are crooks!!!!",1369267200,,676,4.357142857142857

he wore out the other set, I never thought I would ever find these again,
you should have seen the look on his face when he opened the box. He even
spoke! He said 'wow', and he never talks! Once in a blue moon, but this got a word out of him. Thank you thank you!",1243814400,,411,3.963855421686747
