8263447,4,B0016M1EUQ,I enjoyed the first leonard Cohen under review because of the early information on one of my musical heroes. I enjoyed the second I think even more because it shows someone who is still relevant and still creating when people told him he was done. Quite a testament to his talent.,1388880000,,280,4.509803921568627
8263448,5,B0016M1EUQ,"~ This 64-minute documentary has been released under two titles: ""After the Gold Rush"" and ""Under Review: 1977-2006"".  The ""Under Review"" title is appropriately descriptive of the content.  The documentary covers the music released by Cohen in the 1977-2006 period through a commentary by the narrator mixed with interviews with various well-known music critics.  The comments offered by all parties are honest in their assessment of Cohen's work during this period.
~ The narration puts all of this in proper perspective relative to Leonard's changing life during the 1977-2006 period.
~ Highly recommended for anyone wanting to gain some insight into the man and his music during period covered by this documentary.",1384041600,,717,5.383928571428571
8263449,5,B0016M1EUQ,"I like the information about the music that Leonard makes. I like the comments although but I do not agree with the comments about ""Death of a ladies man"" I like that cd very much! It is different yes, but thats nice!",1284163200,,217,4.190476190476191
8263450,5,B0016M1EUQ,We loved learning a little about the stories behind the songs.  This documentary was a high quality accounting of Leonard Cohen's history.  Part two continued.....can't wait for another possible installment!,1232323200,,207,5.866666666666666
8263451,5,B0016M1EUQ,"Maybe too much information for some, but I found it an excellent background on a song-writer poet I much admire.",1222732800,,112,4.65
8263452,2,B0016M1EUQ,I was disappointed by this poorly made documentary. It consists mainly of talking heads that tend to repeat themselves. There is very little footage of Leonard Cohen and the obvious filler bits are irritating. 'I'm Your Man' and 'Ladies and Gentleman' are more worthwhile purchases.,1220400000,,282,5.288888888888889
