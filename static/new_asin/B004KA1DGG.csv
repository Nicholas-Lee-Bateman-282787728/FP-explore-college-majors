4396212,4,B004KA1DGG,"This was probably the best gay-themed film I saw in 2010.  All three of the lead performances were superb and, despite the fantastic elements of the story, it felt very real.  The relationship between the two men was handled great: at turns sexy, funny, infuriating, sad and ultimately redeeming. The wife was not just some impedement to the men's romance, but a flesh and blood character.

I wish it could have gotten more than a tiny US release, but that's what home video is for.  Hopeflly, this will get a wider audience now.",1301961600,7,529,4.655913978494624
4396213,5,B004KA1DGG,"I actually missed my first opportunity to see this film at a film festival because the
summary did not immediately grab me. Then it got several film awards including Sundance
Audience Favorite in its category, and a friend urged me to see it. I was just not prepared
for the perfect story, the absolutely convincing moving acting, the stunning physical
setting in Cabo Blanco and the cinematography, the music. I saw it more than once and each time found more and
more in it. This writer/director (Javier Fuentes-Leon) has incredible talent and instincts,
and he worked on the script for close to a decade until it was really everything it needed
to be. Again and again I was asking myself, how did he manage to pull off THAT effect with
such simple means? This film goes right to the heart of what it is to be human, to be in a
relationship, to be in a community. And, how can we reconcile the irreconcilable parts of
our lives such that we can look unflinching into the mirror? The subtitling is very natural
which is not surprising since the Peruvian director works in LA and is fluent in English. I
only regret so few people are going to be able to see these sweeping beaches, caves and
cliffs in the theater, but I'm glad it is going to be released so soon (June 2011) on DVD
and Blu-ray. Stunning as is its effect the first time, when you don't when what is going to
happen or when, it loses nothing on the repetition because nothing was contrived. I just
started appreciating the minor characters, the unobtrusive but effective symbols, the perfectly laid-out music, all the more. In other words, a perfect film for DVD/Blu-ray !",1299369600,27,1636,4.568027210884353
4396214,5,B004KA1DGG,"This beautiful ghost/love story is an eloquent and haunting exploration of the road not taken, of the aching that comes from realizing, too late, that you allowed your greatest happiness, you're most profound love, to fade from your life with no chance of ever retrieving it.  In a small coastal village in Peru lives Miguel, a fisherman, and his pregnant and devoted wife, Mariela.  Theirs is a life of simple pleasures and surroundings, but they have love, family and a sense of community.  Santiago, a worldly artist has been living off and on in the village for many years but to the town's residents he's an outsider, an untrustworthy interloper living on the fringe of their tight-knit existence.  However, for Miguel, Tiago (as he refers to him) is anything but; in many ways, he is his other self.  These two men have for many years, shared a profound and intense love that due to fear has sadly lingered in shadows for too long.  Where Santiago wants to share a more open relationship with Miguel, the latter refuses, even going so far as to reject his own nature and dismissing their shared feelings as nothing more than a special friendship albeit one that he is unwilling to even acknowledge to the outside world; however, when Santiago threatens to leave again, perhaps for good this time, Miguel is crestfallen and equally angry.  SPOILERS - One afternoon, Miguel arrives home to find Santiago sitting at his dinner table and becomes enraged and when Santiago sees his reaction he realizes that Miguel can see him.  You see, Santiago is now a ghost.  He died in an accident and his soul is trapped in that village but is, luckily, visible to Miguel and only Miguel, who, in turn, promises that he will do everything possible to free his soul from its Earth bound existence.  But nothing could be further from the truth as now Miguel can openly love Santiago without fear of being ostracized yet all the while maintaining his comfortable domestic life.  Now he may walk along the beach holding hands with his true love and now he may sit on the couch between his wife and Santiago and watch television and relax in selfish contentment.  For once Miguel is seemingly at peace with himself and he's unwilling to ever part with that.  After a couple of village kids stumble into Santiago's old beach shack and find paintings and drawings of a nude Miguel, the truth of his relationship with Santiago comes to light and it's rough going for everyone from that moment on.  The magical realism quality of this film worked so exquisitely, it made my heart ache with both joy and pain.  To see these two men who were so much in love but afraid be able to openly express it to one another is as moving as anything I have ever seen in a film.  There are no tidy endings here so don't look for them.  There are many casualties and those that survived bear scars.  The performances were uniformly excellent, even the smallest role is acted perfectly but Cristian Mercado as Miguel is absolutely amazing.  The score by Selma Mutal Vermeulen merits special mention as it adds immeasurably to the feel of the film.  Both the screenplay and direction are uncontrived, honest and direct, thankfully lacking in pretense.  The art direction and cinematography by Diana Trujillo and Mauricio Vidal, respectively, is almost lyrical.  They turn a hardscrabble and poor fishing village into a magical place where both sea and arid landscapes merge to create windswept vistas of unusual and powerful beauty.  Undertow is a poetic and poignant testament to the power of love, loss and redemption.  It is filmmaking of the highest caliber.",1297123200,48,3626,4.78330658105939
4396215,5,B004KA1DGG,"....Society....and our Communities tell us: ""You've not a Ghost of a Chance.""

(( When Society, families, others close by and, sadly, even ourselves keep us from being who we are supposed to be...from loving the person we are supposed to love...then we've allowed ourselves to be screwed (and, yes, I'm talking about me...and, likely, some of you). And every now and again, to remind us of this, as happens in this tale, there will come some sign or object...perhaps as simple as a ""Candle""...which mysteriously appears in our lives, causing us to recall what we've lost ))

(( Have you ever thought...or said to a Beloved: ""Without you, there is Nothing?"" If yes, then you were foretelling a major theme of this film ))

A married, coastal fisherman (Miguel) as our main lead, and an unattached, visiting artist (Santiago) are the focus of this passionate love story between 2 men, spanning youth into adulthood. We'll learn this affair has a likely background of boys spending summers together...of fun times...and, no doubt, moments of finding love with one another. Sadly, however, this is a film focusing on their current day relationship which, like that of Romeo & Juliet, is being thwarted in almost every way.

So, for now, we find ourselves watching and becoming absorbed in an extremely impassioned--though well hidden--love affair. With nearly every scene involving these two leads, our view of the intensity of their love for one another continues to be reinforced, as the film makes its way to a heart-rending conclusion. Of hundreds of such films in my possession, none surpass the realistic displays of love and affection given us by these actors...this director. And in watching this story play out, it becomes oh so obvious that, while Miguel deeply cares for his pregnant wife, it is Santiago who is the Great Love of his life. We see a relationship which has even reached the point of loving ""endearment names"" being used for one another (Miguel as ""Mico"" / Santiago is ""Tiago""), not to mention our witnessing numerous scenes of closeness--erotic and otherwise.

Some final thoughts: You will come to see theirs as an Everlasting Love. And you will witness pure joy in something as simple as a hand-in-hand stroll....and sadness as stirring as a loving hand against cheek. Happy emotions deep enough to hit you in the gut....but also sadness...tears...loss. If you're not ashamed of crying, you will probably do so. This is a movie of lessons for many of we viewers, importantly telling us that letting go of a love, even one we may have at times denied, is an impossibility. It is an especially apt reminder...if we are to live a truthful future life (just watch as our main lead resolves his truth during a heartbreaking moment with his wife near film's end).

PS--Watch for a young, fellow fisherman, Tano by name, who I often see lending support when most others don't, and taking a definite interest in our beleaguered Miguel. See where he positions himself in at least one group gathering....notice where his eyes flicker in scenes involving Miguel. Ah, who knows if he is a possible harbinger for Miguel's future and whether, in this man, ""Mico"" will find the solace and warmth he now so desperately needs. (Am I dreaming this up? You decide.)

4396216,5,B004KA1DGG,"This is probably one of the most beautiful but sad gay themed movie I have seen this year. It's so romantic and so dramatic that I didn't know if I wanted to smile to the clear and wonderful love I could read in Mico and Tiago's eyes, or cry for the not happily ever after that I was obviously approaching.

It's not much of a spoiler, since it's in the blurb of the movie the production house released, but if you don't want to know more, stop read here. This is a ghost story, meaning that Tiago and Mico are lovers, and they are since they were young and Tiago was spending his summers in Mico's little seaside village. But now Mico is married and his wife is pregnant. It's clear that more than his wife Mico desperately loves the child they are waiting. Mico loves his wife with a love that you can have for a dear friend, he is a good husband, but there is no passion between them. The passion is all for Tiago, and their love is so strong that Tiago accepts to be Mico's little dirty secret, to share pieces of his life from afar and to endure the village's disapproval for the ""maricon"", as if he was the only one. The in a odd accident that is not clear if it's a suicide or a stupid accident (I think the second one), Tiago drowns, but his spirit is trapped with Mico. Why? Is their love so strong that Tiago doesn't want to leave Mico? maybe. Or maybe it's time for Mico to admit who he really loves, and with this admission, he will at the same time free and lose Tiago. And at this point I was in tears.

The setting is wonderful, the use of the characters' facial expression masterly, the feelings were conveyed more with images than words. Even the sex scenes between Tiago and Mico (and yes, for who loves a romance movie with also physical expression of that love, you will find it here) are more art than sex.

So I strongly recommend this movie, but bring with you a box of cleenex.",1295136000,2,1901,4.231404958677686

One is rich, artistic, doesn't seem to have a job; the other is a fisherman, rough around the edges and very Catholic.

4396237,1,B004KA1DGG,"Before anyone goes ballistic, let me say right off the bat that the ONLY reason I am giving this Blu-Ray a rating of 1 star is because of the embedded subtitles.  In my opinion, this film, along with Plata Quemada, The Killing of Sister George, The Boys in the Band, The Fox, Chamaco, The History Boys, El Lugar Sin Lmites, Le Salaire de la Peur, Una Giornata Particolare, and a few others I won't mention for the sake of brevity, is one of the great gay films of all time, and destined to become a classic.  It's a film about love, and the power of love to move mountains, and to make imperfect human beings do perfect things in the face of adversity.  It's a film about doing the right thing, and the irony (and the beauty) of this story is that it is only by owning up to his actions and by being true to himself that the protagonist finally becomes a real man.  I love this film, and if I had to select a dozen movies to take with me to a deserted island, this would be one of them.

So why only 1 star?  Blame it on the subtitles.  In this day and age, with Blu-Ray technology being what it is, Wolfe is way behind the times and insists on embedded subtitles.  A damn nuisance!  If you speak the language that the film is in (in this case Spanish), having the damn subtitles obstructing picture clarity is the absolute pits.  It ruins your viewing pleasure, and furthermore it detracts from it, because mentally you're reading the subtitles and doing your own translating at the same time, and in most cases finding fault with the English translation given by the subtitler.  It's a mess!

If I'm going to pay top money for a Blu-Ray release, then I want to have the choice of OPTIONAL subtitles.  I don't want subtitles imposed on me.  I think ALL releases should have subtitles.  In the case of films spoken in English, subtitles are ESSENTIAL because the sound engineers nowadays have a field day adding ambient noises and sound effects to everything, and most times these are so overwhelming that they totally block out the dialogue, making it unintelligible.  In the case of foreign films, subtitles are obviously necessary, but they should be OPTIONAL.  There are roughly 60 million people of Hispanic origin living in the United States.  There are also a few million that are not native Spanish speakers but speak Spanish fluently or otherwise.  These people should have the option of viewing this wonderful film unencumbered, or switching on the subtitles if they so wish.

Now, if Wolfe really wanted to do things right, like the protagonist of this film, then they would have included both English and Spanish optional subtitles.  Why?  Because the Spanish spoken in this film is peppered with local Peruvian idiomatic expressions that are not familiar to ALL Spanish speakers.  For you Americans, that would roughly equate to Cockney dialect being spoken in a British film, or just regular British words like bloke for guy, bird for girlfriend, water closet or loo for restroom, and fancy for like.

I speak Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese besides English.  If I had my way, ALL films released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States (where I live) would have a minimum of 2 subtitles, one being English, and the other being the language the film is spoken in.  If I'm watching a film in French, for instance, and I'm missing a few words here and there, I'd much rather read the subtitles in the original French than an English translation that may or may not be altogether accurate.

I hope whoever re-releases CONTRACORRIENTE when Wolfe's license expires will do it right and include both English and Spanish OPTIONAL subtitles, because this is a little masterpiece of a movie that deserves to be seen, understood, and enjoyed by as many people as possible.  Are you listening, Javier Fuentes-Len?  How about giving us Spanish subtitles of your original script?  And I hope Wolfe stops its horrible practice of embedded subtitles for all its releases.  That stinks, Wolfe.

Please watch this film.  It's a little gem.  And please watch all those other films I mentioned.  And please, liberated ones, I want no flack about The Boys in the Band.  I think it's marvelous, and it's a masterpiece.  I don't think it's Neanderthalish, or demeaning, or any of those abusive adjectives that have become fashionable to throw at it.  If you feel so strongly about Pride, then don't waist your time dissing The Boys, put it to better use: go out and fight for marriage equality.",1416528000,3,4494,4.684948979591836

4396239,5,B004KA1DGG,"From a first look at the cover of Undertow, I thought that the story was going to be frail, simplistic and would fail to convince because such idyllic places may no longer exist, or they are so far removed from our societies. But once I got to see the whole film and think more about it, I realized that it was a beautifully constructed with clear political views. The story is meant to represent large groups of the Peruvian society as a whole (cleverly depicted as an isolated village). They are all protected loosely under the Catholic Church. These groups play simple and vital roles in the society. The fishermen are supposed to be rough, at times hard working, but closely bonded as they need to perform tasks together in non-competitive roles. Women are not so organized, they tend to live lives at home, working from home and occasionally spend time together socializing or working. This society includes the gossipers and the prostitutes almost as equal without much questioning because they play significant roles in the formation of bonds and freeing men from stress, a bit different from the puritan views from the North. Premarital sex exists and is not really rebuked. Finally and most importantly, for the individual homosexual male, if he performs the active role in sex he does not see himself as gay. Anyway, after creating this setting, they introduced a very simple story with an early death. This was brilliant. Indian films introduce music as a form to unite the viewer and to accomplish or establish communication or a connection from the beginning of film, obviously once the plot is set. Latin films on the other hand cannot use reason; they would be rebuked immediately by religious biases. Instead in Undertow they use tragedy, emotions and melancholy. The Latin audience will only change its point of view through melodrama. Through extreme moments of misery (roughly half of the time of the whole film), the wife, his family and friends come to terms with protagonists pain, and they sympathize with him. They may not understand his lifestyle, but they feel his pain and they support him. Others choose not to join his cause, which shows that they are hypocrites, as they go to church all together, commune and listen to a preaching of accommodation, free from judgment. The role of the church was minor and no longer seemed to effectuate any major changes in societal behavior anymore. There was a strong message to the gay offshoot of the society as well: performing active roles in homosexual sex is to be understood as gay sex and sporadic homosexual sex does not exempt men from becoming part of the homosexual tier. Nevertheless, there were points in the cut of the film that some acts were not well explained and only by watching the deleted scenes one could understand. Well, I thought that it was worth watching. And I can imagine how effective the film is with the Latin viewers.",1414108800,,2918,4.838

He affirms his love, his lover is released. Perhaps surprisingly, he is more or less accepted back into the life of the town.

4396268,5,B004KA1DGG,"A simple and beautiful work of art, I felt as though this film lifted my heart right out of my body so that I could gently massage it with my uncontrollable tears.  How does Miguel (Christian Mercado), a man with all his Latino machismo, devotion to his pregnant wife Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), and a deep affinity for his humble fishing village with its centuries old traditions reconcile his love for another man, Santiago (Manolo Cardona)--- a known gay painter whom the entire village shuns?

Miguel's denial is deep and strong and his guilt and shame are sometimes overbearing. When Santiago drowns in an undertow, he returns to Miguel as a ghost who cannot be seen or heard by anyone other than Miguel.  But Miguel is faced with a heart wrenching dilemma. Santiago will never be able to find peace in death unless his body is found and offered to the Lord with a traditional funeral service involving a public ceremony and burial at sea.  But this tiny Peruvian village with its fundamental Christian beliefs is an unlikely backdrop for any type of service honoring a deceased homosexual who was well known and considered a destructive force to everything the villagers stood for.

In order to convince the people to honor his lover in death, Miguel will have to make public the relationship the two men shared. He will also have to convince Santiago's mother as well as the villagers and the local priest that this ""proper"" burial is not only what Santiago wanted but what is required for him to rest in peace. It will also mean that he will never see Santiago's ghost again or share any more time with the man he loved.

Undertow is one of those films. Sadly, not too many films targeted towards gay men are very good...often many of them are too cheesy, too stereotypical, far too hyper-sexual, or just very badly shot with one-dimensional or wooden characters...so it came to a surprise to me that there was nothing cheesy, stereotypical, and hyper-sexual about this movie. The characters come to life. Not to mention, this film is absolutely gorgeous...yes it's slow in its pacing...but it's far from boring or tedious. You really get a feel of the setting and the characters are very relatable. The rarest of all is finding a gay film that also makes you want to cry, and oh boy, will this movie get at least one tear to fall at the corner of your eye, possibly more. It's such a heart wrenching story, and yet so beautiful, lush, poignant, and uplifting. I can't say enough good things about Undertow.

Miguel is a fisherman whose life with his  pregnant wife Mariela seems pretty idyllic. But his emotions, like the undertow of the film's title, are heading far away from the shores of stability and into the arms of newcomer artist Santiago. Santiago has an 'urban' sensibility, which means he is comfortable with his sexuality to the extent that he is prepared to be ostracized by this provincial community rather than hide it. Miguel, however,  feels he must keep a closeted existence.  The film takes an unusual  twist when one of the characters becomes a ghost who needs a proper burial to set the spirit at rest.

4396292,5,B004KA1DGG,"The story is set in a quiet little South American (Peruvian?) fishing village out in the middle of nowhere. It has the classic gay movie theme : heavily closeted gay man caught between his true romance on one hand and oppressive Catholic, provincial macho values and, most devastatingly, his own wife and child on the other. It would have been a Latino BrokeBack Mountain had there not been a cheeky plot twist that brings in the supernatural. But don't be mistaken to think that from then on the movie sinks into a tacky semi-comic fairy tale flick where everybody ends up happy. Instead, the director cleverly uses the surrealistic element to highlight a poignant theme : for as long as there's societal pressure, a closeted gay man's highest aspiration is having a visible family on one side and an invisible gay lover on the other - living a cowardice lie.

Plot surprises aside, what really sets the movie apart is skillful story telling and exquisite acting. The 2 male leads and the supporting actress playing the wife are skilled pros able to portray their characters in a subtle and totally believable way.

This movie does not jerk your tears but it will move you deeply whether you're gay or not. Too bad it's not in English which puts it in danger of being overlooked by the international audience.

The ghost-plot is the perfect vehicle to explore the self-denial and repression of the protagonist, Mico.  According to the writer/director, the last scene that he wrote perfectly illustrates this.  It's the scene where Mico is first hesitant, then elated to walk the street, hand-in-hand with his invisible partner.  My favorite lines are near the beginning, when Mico tells Tiago, ""You think everyone is like you"", (accepting of their relationship),  to which Tiago replies, ""No, I think they are like you."" (Bi and repressed).  Like Brokeback Mountain, it goes way outside the stereotypical depiction of a gay life.  For an Anglo audience, to see it set in a rural, Latino community is a stunning reminder of the worldliness of the topic.  The location and cinematography were breath-taking, the music was perfect, and the cast was excellent, especially Mercado, whose range of emotion is spectacular and his character is so totally believable.

In fact it reminded me to brush up on my Spanish as I was able to follow along with few problems. Anyhow, the film was beautifully directed and the cast was superb. The Musical Score only heightened the movie.  The Director should be commended for his risk taking with his story (Although) nothing new here it does have a refreshing twist.  It's similar to BBM in that the story lines are so tragic.  Different because it is showing that no matter what Race, Religion you belong to everyone deals with the same emotions, struggles and losses. I am a DEVOUT supporter of Indie Films and this one has made my list of favorites. I've watched it quite a few times and I always end up feeling a sense of cleansing has taken place.  The ONLY bad mark in my opinion and it really isn't bad is that as I've watched the Bonus Features I noticed the passionate kiss between Miquel and Santiago hit the cutting floor.  I don't understand why this was taken out because it displayed to me the DEPTH of love they had for one another more deeply than a scene with them rolling around in the (hay). I mean sand.  So I felt that although the Director had taken a risk with this film he pulled back just a little by deleting that scene. He either deleted because it was too INTENSE and didn't want eyes or heads rolling or he was trying to stay within editing limits. I hope that the latter is true.

Honestly, the only safe way to compare Undertow to BBM is to say that they are both brilliant.

So brilliant. My jaw literally dropped while watching this movie. Scene after scene kept getting more and more touching, more emotional, and in creative/unusual ways. This isn't a cliche movie, or a spin-off movie, or a ""gay agenda"" movie, it is its own story and boy does it hold its own.

I desperately want to describe the plot to you, but I think it's absolutely best not to be too spoiled. Yes, a married man is having conflicting emotions about his homosexuality (That story isn't really new) but the way it's captured in Undertow is like nothing you've ever experienced before. It's fresh in the right places, well acted, well directed, subtly scored... Overall, a work of art that should be placed high on the mantel of gay cinema. Or ANY cinema for that matter! This is a love story and anybody can relate to that.

About the Blu Ray: The film was recorded in 16mm so its got plenty of data for a nice HD transfer, and it does look nice, but it may not be quite as glossy as some of the BDs in your collection because films in 35mm definitely look more impressive in 1080p. I also get the slight hint that maybe such a low budget film as this one didn't quite get the proper digital treatment one would expect from a major release.  Overall the ocean waves sound lovely and the imagery is crisp. Natural, would be the best word for me to describe it. Not demonstration quality, but not nasty standard definition either.

But Miguel has a secret, in that he is carrying on an affair with Santiago, a painter visiting the village, who locals shun because he is a loner and suspected as gay. Santiago wants to be able to be seen with Miguel, but is told that isn't possible, until an ironic twist in the story makes the arrangement more accommodating to Miguel's discretion.

This is a powerful, emotional love story, with an original approach to the typical ""married man on the downlow"" scenario that is typical in macho cultures.

4396309,5,B004KA1DGG,"This wonderful and achingly beautiful film that is gorgeously filmed in a small, by the sea, village in Peru is part ghost story and part a love story.  The part that is a love  story between Santiago and Miguel forms the part that touched me to my soul because it tells a beautiful tale of the unfulfilled love between two men (Miguel and Santiago).  The roles of Santiago and Miguel are brilliantly played by Cristian Mercado and Manolo Cardona.  In watching them in this film, one really believes in their love for each other.  In fact, all of the acting in ""Undertow"" is superb as is the script, direction and photography.  I really enjoyed this marvelous ""little"" film.  It's truly my kind of movie that makes one think, and most of all feel emotionally.  I loved it.

4396310,5,B004KA1DGG,"Now and then a small quiet film surfaces without ballyhoo or even much press and finds its way before audiences who are deeply moved by a film about which few have even heard. Such is the case for UNDERTOW (CONTRACORRIENTE), a little film from Peru that is not only well written and directed (Javier Fuentes-Len) and well acted by a fine and credible group of actors, but one that also deals with story and information that few film dare to touch. The film has won many awards at film festivals on the order of Sundance and GLAAD, but it has failed to make the public take notice in the theaters - probably because it is a Latin American male love story.

According to the writer/director, the story 'takes place in a small conservative seaside village in Peru. On the surface, all appears well for a fisherman and his devoted wife who are expecting their first baby. The hero is a hardworking and respected member of his community, which holds fast to rigid traditions. There is one wrinkle - he is also devoted to his male lover. A catastrophic accident does not erase the presence of his lover, as the fisherman must now contend with the apparitions of his forbidden love and the gossip and disapproving stares of his neighbors. And it may go without saying - his wife isn't too pleased either.'

Miguel (Cristian Mercado) is the little fisherman who seems to have it all - a loving wife Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), a solid group of friends and family, and the incipient birth of his first child. But Miguel is a closeted gay man/bisexual who is in love with a painter/photographer, the handsome Santiago (Manolo Cardona) who seems content to maintain a relationship with Miguel in secret. But there is an accident in which one of Miguel's young friends dies and Miguel is asked by the family to prepare the body for burial, carry the boy on a bamboo stretcher, offer a eulogy and then take the body out to sea to bury it in the water - an old tradition in this small Peruvian fishing village that assures that the dead person's soul will find rest.
Santiago takes photos of the funeral procession and it is obvious that the townspeople gossip about the painter - a man who paints pictures and is not married is suspect and homophobia rages. As Mariela gives birth to their son Miguelito, Miguel is torn between his devotion to his wife and son and his desire for Santiago's physical presence. In a series of beautifully realized love scenes between the two men it is obvious that there is a struggle on the part of both Miguel and Santiago: they love each other but that love is forbidden. Santiago appears to Miguel one night and says that he is dead, that Miguel is the sole person able to see Santiago's ghost. This allows Miguel and Santiago to be together in the village, as Santiago cannot be seen: they are able at last to love each other in the open. But the village discovers that the missing Santiago's home contained nude paintings of men - men who appear to be images of Miguel. The village treats Miguel as an outcast, his wife is outraged and leaves, and Miguel feels he has lost everything. Santiago's family come to claim the body and Miguel finally has the courage to be the man he really is. The film ends with a deeply moving tradition upheld.

Both Cristian Mercado and Manolo Cardona handle their difficult roles brilliantly: their physical chemistry is visceral and their dealing with the Peruvian prejudice is poignant. But each of the actors is excellent. The cinematography by Mauricio Vidal captures the flavor of the Peruvian seaside and the many underwater scenes are breathtaking. Selma Mutal Vermeulen provides the musical score that is the perfect balance of folksongs and background music. But in the end it is writer/director Javier Fuentes-Len who deserves the kudos for a brilliant film that took considerable courage to make. Hopefully we will be seeing more of his work in the near future. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, June 11",1307577600,2,3969,4.699712643678161

Don't pass up the opportunity to see this.  I found myself in tears here and there since there are some powerful moments.

The story is about the inner struggle of a married man's conflicted double life and the turn of events that occur when life unfolds and it plainly happens.  It's about the sacrifice one makes when we want our cake and want to eat it, too.  It's about how love, understanding and uncertainty co-exist and it can be okay to not know what's going to happen within the next minute.

Occasionally a Netflix rental deserves to be bought, and Undertow is such a film.  This is not Hollywood -- prepare for a slow, loving unfolding.

4396315,5,B004KA1DGG,"There are films that inadvertently affect you and cause an impact that make you question what is that you just saw. They make you ask if there was a meaning or message involved, and they also surprise you in many other ways. That is the best way - for now, at least - that I can describe ""Undertow"" (Contracorriente), one of the most remarkable and passionate Peruvian movies that I have seen in quite some time. And I'm sure that there will be some that label it controversial. Hell, for that matter, I would also describe it as educational.

Miguel (Cristian Mercado) is happily married to Mariela (Tatiana Artengo). Theirs is a simple life, in a small coastal Peruvian town, where Miguel makes a living as a fisherman. They also happen to be anxiously waiting for the birth of their first child. However, one of Miguel's relatives dies, and it's up to him to give the last rites before the corpse is buried in the sea - a tradition in this village. It is at this point that we meet Santiago (Manolo Cardona), who appears out of nowhere, taking photographs at the funeral ceremony, particularly of Miguel. As it turns out, both men have been lovers for some time, and Santiago came to town -- he's from the big city, from a wealthy family - to convince Miguel to go away with him on a vacation. Theirs, also, is a secret, illicit love. This, of course, is a problem for Miguel, because his wife is about to deliver his child any minute. Santiago seems to not understand Miguel's position, and gets upset at his lover. Eventually and mysteriously, Santiago disappears, and that's when Miguel's problems really begin.

 ""Undertow"" is not just any gay movie, as you may think during its first minutes. It is quite a powerful indictment against many issues at the same time. It asks the question about what it is to be a real gay male. How do you know if it is just a one event thing? It also questions the values of a small town in regards to loyalty and friendship, and the power of gossip. It also talks about true love under harsh conditions, and director by Javier Fuentes-Len does a fantastic job in gluing all these feelings together. The acting is superb, as well as the natural colorful locations. Not in vain, the film deservedly won awards at the Sundance, Miami San Sebastian International, and 42 more film festivals. The Blu-ray edition includes a making-of documentary; interviews with writer/director Javier Fuentes, and actors Christian Mercado and Tatiana Astengo; deleted scenes; and more.

8432656,5,B004KA1DGG,"Sadly so many people who would otherwise really enjoy this film will be put off because it is subtitled.
Americans seem to have some pathological aversion to foreign language movies.
Please do not let this stop you from seeing this sensitive and well-filmed treatment of a subject that so many other films have made a hash of.

Shot in Peru, this so perfectly captures the inner turmoil of a man in a heterosexual relationship, with a wife expecting a child, who has his inner desires awakened by another man.  The object of his love is an artist, and something of an outcast because the townsfolk have realised he's gay.
This could have been a tawdry story, rather like ""Brokeback Mountain"" was allowed to degenerate into with all those unnecessary tacky additions  that were NOT written by Annie Proule.
Instead, we are shown the inner workings of the mind of a man torn between family duty and a love he perhaps never knew he was capable of.

This is just so well filmed, and the performances by the two leading men are absolutely perfect.

Now this is kind of a spoiler alert , ...but nothing the cover of the DVD won't reveal.

Early into the movie the artist drowns accidentally, ...and his body is missing in the sea.
Now although he continues to appear in the film as a ""ghost""...this is NOT a supernatural story.
This is made plain by telling us that no one else can see him except his former lover, and it then becomes plain there really is no ghost at all, but we are seeing the memories and fantasies that continue to play in the mind of a man expected to be heterosexual, but so desperately missing the freedoms and intense sexual expressions he found with his soul mate.

He becomes obsessed with finding the missing body in order to give it a decent burial...strangely enough back in the sea.
He even finds the drowned man but is reluctant to bring the body to shore and carry out his plan for the funeral because it will finally destroy his memories and his continuing fantasies of what might have been with his lover alive.

This is all done without a trace of sensationalism, and so well performed that you will truly believe in the deep affection these two men have found with each other. Their love scenes together on the beach are truly beautifully handled. (Nudity, but discrete and distant for those concerned with such matters.)
It's just SO rare that a gay themed movie is handled with such sensitivity and lack of judgement or sensationalism.
I seriously doubt that something this restrained could ever have been made in America.

Do not, repeat, DO NOT be put off by the sub-titles...they are easy to read and quite unobtrusive.
If you are seeking genuine gay cinema free from the usual clich twinks, clownish drag queens and bar-fly promiscuous characters, then this is a must-see!
FAR better than the mindless ""Weekend"" or the dreary ""From Beginning to End"", this movie will genuinely touch you with its warmth and lightness of touch, despite its serious subject matter. It is not without some humour.
Definitely a gay-classic that deserves to be seen by a far wider audience.",1489968000,,3105,4.682568807339449
