7997564,3,B0000AKY3I,"I'm clearly not the perfect person to review this.  Filmed in beautiful Neskaupstadur -- which nobody's ever heard of -- I saw it twice and still couldn't twig to the plot.  Certainly the most ""Icelandic"" movie I've ever seen, even more so than Reykjavik 101.  If you know what I mean.  And if you don't, rough.  Don't miss Robyn in the final reel.",1462320000,,348,4.4603174603174605
7997565,4,B0000AKY3I,"This movie was not the movie I had thought I ordered.  However, I did enjoy the movie anyway, once I figured out how to play it on my computer.  Even though the movie contained Icelandic dialogue with English subtitles, it was done well and the opening background music was beautiful.  The overall plot was laid out well and the actors played their parts in a believable fashion.",1441152000,,379,4.626865671641791
7997566,1,B0000AKY3I,"This movie was described by the Chicago Tribune as ""Hilarious and Rowdy! Lurid and Sexy""  The New York Times called it ""An Amusing Comedy"". Wouldn't you think that means it should be funny?  Instead, it is a horrid tragedy with not a single character having any redeeming value. They are all full of greed, lust and lies. The language was horrible, and quite frankly, I've never found arson and incest to be that humorous.",1201910400,4,422,4.6891891891891895
7997567,4,B0000AKY3I,"This reminds me a bit of French family dramas with skeletons in the closet revealed amidst festive holiday get-togethers.  But Director Baltasar Kormakur's Icelanders are decidedly on the wild side, corrupt, and often sloppy drunk.  Their dialogue is sharp and rough, their language biting and crude, their behavior violent.

The story is a bit familiar with the head of a fishing family getting old and worrying about the business he has built.  Currently running it is his elder son who does not inspire confidence.  In fact, he frequently goes against the old man's wishes.  But it soon becomes clear that the old man has lost his judgment and is living in the past, and it is he who is detrimental to the company's bottom line.

Plot point one is the return of the favorite son with his pregnant girl friend.  This is the son who should be running the company, the patriarch believes.  However the son has no interest in living out his life in the fishing village and neither does his girl friend.  The girl friend is the objectifying element in the story, and we are compelled to see the story from her point of view.

Also returning are the daughter and her husband.  Together she and the older son conspire to wrest control of the company from the father...and then all hell breaks loose.

Complicating matters is the fact that Kristin, the favorite son's old girl friend (and half-sibling), is still madly in love with him and won't let him go.

What makes this work is a steamy script with some laugh-out-loud moments, and a careful, atmospheric direction that shows a way of life that is familiar but distant.  This is ultimately a story about the encroachment of the modern world on an Icelandic fishing village.  It could be a fishing village anywhere.

See this for Baltasar Kormakur, a film maker of promise.",1139356800,7,1822,4.733333333333333
7997568,3,B0000AKY3I,"This film has great photography and excellent acting; as a story though, it treads familiar (i.e., Bergmanesque) ground.  The coming together of a family, the revelations within, the incestuous leanings are nothing new.  The characters seem to have been pulled from central casting for Dysfunctional Family Dramas. The runaway son, the daughter with the oafish husband, the son who stayed on, the disenchanted grandchild ... they're all here. The facet of this film that doesn't ring true is the calling together of all the children and then the waiting period before the father tells them why they are there. This is a tired device and most people wouldn't sit and wait while their father gives them annoyingly cryptic answers to their questions. It's time we had a family drama where things are played out a bit more realistically. Obviously that film won't come from Hollywood, so I look to Europe to deliver. Kudos to the great acting, I just wish it had been around a stronger plot.",1082332800,7,987,4.904191616766467
7997569,5,B0000AKY3I,"If you love dysfunctional holiday films that portray reality, this is it. (the holiday stuff is in the background)  If you are sick to death of Smarmy, Gooey ""Family"" films that make you feel horrible because there's no way your family will ever be like that---this is for you.  If your family is really dysfunctional, and you feel totally alone on the holidays, this movie will let you know other people understand.
  Everybody shafts each other in the end here..a type of King Lear.  I didn't find it really humorous until I thought about it later.
The ugliness of the people's behavior is strongly contrasted against the AMAZING beauty of the landscapes.
The middle-aged dad calls all his kids home around the holidays to have a chat.  He's got something to tell.  They are licking their chops hoping for an inheritance, money or news that he's selling the family fish processing plant.  They think they are going to be RICH!  This is the moment they've been waiting for!
(Boy have I seen this before where the kids are handed money all their lives without responsibility and too much trust.)
  In fact, one of the sons & his wife are already swindling him, embezzling & trying to sell it out from under him.  Another son has for years been taking his father's money for education and been living on it as a musician.  Another daughter took the father's money for her education and became a film maker.  A self-destructive girl cousin is always hanging around and is obsessively in love with the musician.
  All great if you can pay for it, but not one of these adult kids chose a career that is self-supporting.  They all think there's more money where that came from.
  When they all come back to town, they fall back into the crazy activities that are common, at least to my area of small towns----random, angry sex and drinking.  In fact, these kids are seething with anger, even the musician.
  Apparently when the Mother was dying, both the parents and the aunt didn't handle things very well...and maybe there's nothing to be done to prevent such rage.  Maybe if the parents had discussed her impending death, maybe if the Dad and Aunt had been more assertive and upfront.  There was no talking about the dying and death, just the Dad and especially the Aunt acting like servants.
  The Dad doesn't want to sell the business because he values the community and people, and he wants the musician---which he thinks has been studying business, to come back and manage.  If he sells the business, it will kill the community as it is the main source of income.
  Anyway, when the doodie hits the fan, it was nice to see the kids start pillaging the house, as I have seen in my family and others.  They think they are getting nothing, so they become animals and steal cheapo crap.  It was nice to see that the Dad had a ""nice"" reward for them in the end too.  It was good to see the Aunt finally stand up to the kids.
Other Realistic Holiday films:  I would also recommend ""Stuart Saves His Family"", ""Home for the Holidays"" and ""National Lampoons Christmas Vacation""
Note: if you want to prevent ""greed gone beserk"" in your family, look into ""Incentive Trusts"" on the web.  Bad stuff happens to a lot of folks, ask them what happened in the family after ""money-bags"" died, or how did the kids turn out when everything was given not earned.  You would be amazed at the stories I have heard or seen.",1076112000,18,3401,4.574503311258278
7997570,3,B0000AKY3I,"This is an independent film which is set in Iceland even though it was filmed in Canada.  It's the story of an aging fishing industry tycoon who is being pressured by his family to sell his factory.  There are environmental and moral issues here because if he sells to a big corporation, the people in the town will lose their jobs, fish will be caught in tremendous batches and half of them will be wasted.  His three grown children, however, want him to sell.  The whole family hates each other and there is cruelty and anger in every word they speak.  Soon, secrets begin to be unveiled.  The conclusion is sad but expected.
The acting is excellent, the directing good and the photography captured the cold and isolation of the place.  The whole film is a bit depressing, however, and even though it held my interest throughout, I just couldn't feel sympathy for any of the characters.  Film buffs might like it but there are better films around.",1067472000,7,949,4.607142857142857
