6503747,5,B00LT1JKN2,"Finally to be released on DVD and Blu-Ray November 11, 2014 are all 120 episodes of the Batman TV Series starring Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. They aired on ABC 1966-69.
  The Batman movie starring The Riddler, Joker, Penguin and Lee Meriwether as Catwoman was filmed between Season One and Two. It is not included in the set but it's a must-have to complete your Bat-collection. I tried to insert a product link but it kept loading Amazon Instant Video instead of the dvd or blu-ray.  Just type in Batman the movie.
Recently DC published this trade paperback of all the Batman & Detective Comics stories that inspired the show in general and individual episodes as well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-TV-Stories/dp/1401244955/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The TV Stories</a>

Video: The remastering done on this set is amazing. The show is presented in its original full frame 1:33 ratio and looks fantastic. The episodes look clean and bright. The colors are vivid and really pop. It really is a revelation after watching drab washed out prints on television for years.

Audio: English Mono, and Portuguese. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Extras: The boxset includes an additional bonus dvd loaded with special features including...

* Hanging With Batman - 30:18
* Holy Memorabilia, Batman - 29:56
* Batmania Born - Building The World Of Batman - 29.38
* Bats Of The Round Table - 45:05
* Inventing Batman: In The Words Of Adam West ( 2 parts) - 58:59
* Na Na Na Batman! - 12:12

* The Burt Ward Screen Test With Adam West - 6:12
* The Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell Screen Test For The Roles Of Batman And Robin - 4:19
*A James Blakeley Tribute - 2:20

A Note About Disc 18:

Audio on the bonus disc - English only.
Subtitles on the bonus disc - English and Portuguese

Additional Notes:

The Batman boxset was originally released with missing footage. The deletions included:

01 The William Dozier narration that originally opened the pilot episode, 'Hi Diddle Riddle'.

02 A 60-second dropped scene in the episode. 'Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds'.

03 An assembly of villain tags from the end of various episodes.

Kudos to Warner Bros for listening to the fans and correcting the errors and sending corrected discs to all of the fans that bought the botched pressings and requested a replacement.

All pressings released since the original batch have been corrected. You can tell you have a corrected set by checking out the first disc. In addition to having the narration restored to 'Hi Diddle Riddle', there are some bonus features on the new pressings...

01 Next Week Villains - 7:52 : Rather than restore each tag back to the endings of each episode, WB opted to included them all in one place.

02 Batman's Amazing Arsenal - 0:39

03 A Rare Rebroadcast Promo - 0.21

One Final Thing:
The limited edition blu-ray set has collectable packaging with a hot wheels replica of the Batmobile, the Adam West scrapbook, and 44 vintage trading card. Sadly, this will not be included in the dvd set.",1405814400,89,6088,4.508196721311475
6503750,2,B00LT1JKN2,"I am giving this release a one star rating, at least until I see the completed package in my hands. The show in MHO should be rated five stars but I expect the studio to ruin it with releasing double sided disks like other shows releases in the past have been ruined. I can live easily with dual layer, but truly despise double sided disks. Also one star as I have seen nothing about how many disks for the three seasons, 120 half hour episodes. Nothing to limited info about extras. Oh, I have pre-ordered the release on dvd as I cannot afford blu- ray either. Just about time for the cable viewing of two Batman episodes. I expect others will update my concerns before I get back, and thanks. I bought a couple copies of the movie with different packaging over the past few years just because I truly enjoy the show. Remeber, five stars for the show, lets see what the studio does with the dvd release.",1405728000,8,904,4.355029585798817

6503765,5,B00LT1JKN2,This is all I thought it would be and more. As a child of the 1960s who is in his 60s this series takes me back to a simpler time where people disagreed with each other but still had respect. I love all series from this decade.

Looking at this series now as an adult in this time period I definitely see this more as just fun. But when this first came on TV when I was a little kid, this was serious business. Lol!  My sister still has the scars on her arm from running thru a glass sliding door  wearing a make shift cape yelling dada dada dada Batman!  Ah the memories!  :)",1519084800,9,481,3.9791666666666665
6503769,5,B00LT1JKN2,Nothing like sitting back and enjoying one of my favorite shows that I watched as a kid. It's great to see it as an adult realizing how campy it was and the occasional adult reference that went over my head when I first watched it. It also made me realize how far dental hygiene has come. Today it's hard to find a single actor/actress with anything but sparkly white teeth. Seeing how many of those 60's beauties had yellow teeth was rather startling. Still great fun for the family.,1518739200,,484,4.449438202247191

6503799,4,B00LT1JKN2,"That's was what FCC Commissioner Minnow called television on the 55th anniversary of the FCC.This show might be based on a true story. The original premise is that Bruce Wayne's parents are killed by ""criminals"" and he makes it his duty to fight crime where he finds it ever since. This show takes a different tack. For more information on the original premise,you'll need to watch such shows as Hogan's Heroes and Crime Story. Many of the characters in Batman can be found in such shows. The character played by Dennis Farina in Crime Story is a reporter in one of the Batman episodes. This show is ahead of it's time for another reason because Bruce Wayne's parents,et al can't be killed until 16 years,234 days after the first episode air date when Ronald Wilson Reagan signs Executive Order 12,333 on December 2,1982. Besides the content,the packaging is very neat. A booklet is provided and there are some extras included which makes it obvious why this was a very popular show. I don't think many television sets were shot watching this show,but when they turned it into movies...well,that's a different story.",1508803200,,1116,4.848167539267016

6503840,5,B00LT1JKN2,"I loved watching this show in 1966 as a second grader when it originally began on television. It's great to watch it again.

So far, I've seen about half the episodes in the complete DVD set I purchased. I am pleased with the quality of the videos. And the episodes seem to be complete, including the epilogues at the end of the second of the two-part episodes, as well as the opening and closing credits for each episode.

When I made my purchase, Amazon was offering two different DVD versions, one dated 2014 and one dated 2015. I bought the one dated 2015. I'm not sure what the difference is between the two. But I am very happy with my 2015 set.

This Batman television series from 1966-68 may be called camp, may be called comedy, or may be called adventure/suspense, but it was enjoyable viewing for me.

Every now and then, an episode even provides a nice tidbit of advice or a good insight. For example, in one episode Bruce Wayne says to Dick Grayson ""astronomy . . . . reminds how little we are."" The Hizzoner the Penguin episode even provides some nice political satire.

I've already watched all the extras on the final disk of the 18 disk set. I enjoyed some of the behind the scenes information provided. I especially liked the background information on Adam West (""Hanging With Batman"") and the round table discussion between Adam West and some others (""Bats of the Round Table""). Those features make this DVD set even better than it would be if it was just the 120 episodes.",1501459200,,1492,4.5315985130111525

6503864,5,B00LT1JKN2,"No, this isn't White Zombie, this is Batman!!  A television series that I enjoyed as a child and still enjoy as an adult.
I never looked at this show as being silly, campy or as a comedy. I just thought of it as a colorful comic translated onto the TV screen.
A sometimes needed relief to get away from today's too serious, dark, violent and gritty television and films. Adam West was a Bruce Wayne/Batman who drank milk or orange juice. Was a good role model for family entertainment. Of course, I had childhood crushes on actresses such as Julie Newmar playing Catwoman and Yvonne Craig playing Batgirl.  What really made the show was it being a two part show with a cliffhanger leaving you in suspense talking about it with friends until watching the 2nd part the next day at the same Bat Time and same Bat Channel.
 I originally planned just to get a DVD set as I thought an old series from 1966 would not be much better on Blu Ray. But since the Blu Ray happened to be cheaper, I went and bought the Blu Ray set and was glad I did, because it looks and sounds awesome. It transferred very well to Blu Ray and looks like a brand new series rather than a show from over 51 years ago. I don't know if the DVD looks just as good, but I am very happy with the Blu Ray anyways.  There is a Special Feature disc full of bonus material that I would consider almost worth the price of the set alone to watch.",1499040000,2,1404,4.20817843866171

Batman had a solution for everything.  If it was Jokers laughing gas he would pop some sad pills. If Shame used fear gas he had the bravery pills. The caped crusader always found a way out of his situation.  They left you with a bad situation  for Batman and Robin
on Wednesday  and you tuned in Thursday to see how he escaped.

The criminals were all fantastic, Joker, Cat Woman, False Face and several others. The Pow, Wham, Splat fight scenes were great.  This show was just a joy to watch on every level. Adam West played Batman as no one else could have!  He was so tongue in cheek it was amazing. I am so glad this wonderful series finally made it to dvd after all these years.  The fans waited for a long time and we finally got it.

If you are a fan this is what you have been waiting for.  I met Adam West at a book signing, a class act and I was honored to shake hands with the caped crusader!

Chuck your dour, brooding, vicious superheros out the window, and get ready for the greatest campy duo to sleuth the truth and thwart their foes. Modern stunning visual effects are not present, of course, and instead gaseous emissions and tilting the camera tease your imagination. The vast majority of episodes have aged quite well, however, there are a few which have decidedly not aged well due to some cringeworthy racism and sexism. These are easily skipped -- if you don't want to look at them as a reminder of the times. There are a lot of guest stars and cameos that you will or will most likely recognize and everyone seems to be having a lot of fun.",1481587200,,737,4.633587786259542

6504007,3,B00LT1JKN2,"I was six years old when the first season of Batman started.  And like all the kids I knew was a huge fan.  And could hardly wait from week to week for it to come on.  Especially the second part that would come on the next night.  I do have the Batman Movie that came out on dvd.  But except for that I don't remember seeing these t.v. shows since then.
Now watching them as an adult.  There is a lot of dialogue that a kid wouldn't get.  And there are refrences about not smoking and things like that they were trying to teach kids.  So after watching these dvds it was fun seeing all the cameos as they would scale up the side of the buildings.  Anybody from Lurch on the Addams Family to Santa Clause would open up a window..
The first season was the best.  It seemed like even towards the end of the first season it was starting to run out of steam a little bit.  The second season was like the first.  But by the third season they had quit doing two part shows and were just doing one part.  And it wasn't as good.  And it wasn't as good when they brought in Bat Girl.  Who it seemed to me like later they modeled Penelope Pitstop on the Saturday cartoon Wacky Races.  For all the shows from this era.  This and Get Smart were the two I wanted to have on dvd the most.",1476316800,3,1273,4.028

6504081,5,B00LT1JKN2,"What can be said about Batman '66? People deride it as ""campy"" and dismiss it. Yes, Batman is all dark and gritty now, heck in the Zack Snyder universe, you could sand wood on batman's face. Back in the day, Batman was pretty dang silly. It's rumored that the character of Bruce Wayne (played by the esteemed Adam West) was modeled sort of on Hugh Hefner for the swinging bachelor vibe. Burt Ward played the role of Robin great, and from what I've heard from behind the scenes stuff, he was banged up beyond belief. It's fun, campy 60s action comedy. The funny part is, there has been a re-invigoration of the franchise in the '66 era. New DVD releases, the movie release, the comic line, classic action figures....It's funny, because this version is the one a lot of us grew up with. (Gen X and Boomers anyway) When we think Batman, we think Adam West and Burt Ward. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys comedy, goofy fights, and just overall zaniness.

If anyone tells you, this isn't what Batman is about...I have two words for them. Rainbow Beast.",1467072000,2,1066,4.552083333333333

6504085,5,B00LT1JKN2,"As a little boy, I grew up watching this series when it was in syndication.  Most TV stations showed the paired episodes back to back so I would not have to miss the conclusion.  Forty years later, I am watching this on blu-ray with my kids and they love it.  The mono sound is decent coming out of my 7.1 stereo system.  The HD picture looks great.  I even noticed the details of the Joker's mustache being hidden under layers of makeup because Caesar Romero refused to shave it.

The box set has three flip out panel cases, one for each season.  This seems to be the typical format for TV series.  There is also an included episode guide listing each guest villain.  When all 3 seasons are slipped into the group slip cover, it slides neatly on my shelf with my other standard size DVDs and BDs.

I have yet to run into any of the sound or picture issues noted on other earlier BD releases, but it will take me at least 60 nights of viewing to finish.  Until then, my kids and I will be viewing this awesome collection every night.

6504118,4,B00LT1JKN2,"THE ""camp"" superhero classic from the Sixties is finally available on DVD (and priced cheaper now than when I pre-ordered it; silly me).  It's great looking and largely intact (I could have sworn there were more celebrity cameo ""Bat-climbs,"" but unless some have been deleted, I guess I remembered wrong).  I'm only docking a star because there aren't really any commentary tracks apart from the ""special features""  pilot with Adam West's droll  interjections, even though pre-release reports spoke of commentary tracks being recorded. If true, where are they?  And the documentary material collected on the special features disc leaves something to be desired. Some of the features are interesting and informative  but too many concentrate  on fanboy gush or obsessions, and there is far too little time or attention devoted to the bit players or villains (Alfred, where are you?). These featurettes are really the Adam West Show.  That's fine as far as it goes, West is personable and funny enough.  But Burt Ward/Robin is pretty much left on the sidelines and Yvonne Craig is nowhere to be found.  WHERE'S BATGIRL???  Come one, she was the hit of the third season and she's hardly mentioned.  Miss Craig sadly died recently but I'm sure she could have been involved when this project was being assembled, or surely someone years ago might have produced something showcasing the Dominoed Dare-doll.  Adam West's interviews seem to date from all over the place, the 70s to the present.  Phooey on ignoring Batgirl and Yvonne Craig (whose memoir, ""From Ballet to the Batcave and Beyond"" is well worth seeking out).",1464048000,4,1614,5.0643939393939394

Video: The remastering done on this set is amazing. The show is presented in its original full frame 1:33 ratio and looks fantastic. The episodes look clean and bright. The colors are vivid and really pop. It really is a revelation after watching drab washed out prints on television for years.

Audio: English Mono, and Portuguese. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Extras: The boxset includes an additional bonus dvd loaded with special features including...

* Hanging With Batman - 30:18
* Holy Memorabilia, Batman - 29:56
* Batmania Born - Building The World Of Batman - 29.38
* Bats Of The Round Table - 45:05

A Note About Disc 18:

Audio on the bonus disc - English only.
Subtitles on the bonus disc - English and Portuguese

Additional Notes:

The Batman boxset was originally released with missing footage. The deletions included:

01 The William Dozier narration that originally opened the pilot episode, 'Hi Diddle Riddle'.

02 A 60-second dropped scene in the episode. 'Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds'.

03 An assembly of villain tags from the end of various episodes.

Kudos to Warner Bros for listening to the fans and correcting the errors and sending corrected discs to all of the fans that bought the botched pressings and requested a replacement.

All pressings released since the original batch have been corrected. You can tell you have a corrected set by checking out the first disc. In addition to having the narration restored to 'Hi Diddle Riddle', there are some bonus features on the new pressings...

01 Next Week Villains - 7:52 : Rather than restore each tag back to the endings of each episode, WB opted to included them all in one place.

02 Batman's Amazing Arsenal - 0:39

03 A Rare Rebroadcast Promo - 0.21

I like t his version of batman , he's a good man who gives a damn in spite of the silly stories and such.  The villians make this show though. Something that bothers me about todays shows is lack of costumes on some villains.  Here that's not a problem  They are nice and colorful. So common arrow and the rest.  GIVE us costumed villians.  ANYWAYS, these eps look great on my Italian boxset version.  I haven't watched that many of them. But why would they be edited?",1457049600,,732,4.134751773049645

The episodes all appear to be of great video and audio quality. Subtitles are available on all of them as well.

One complaint I have is that it was a little difficult to remove some of the DVDs from the case. However, once this had been done, they were much easier to remove again later.

One minor complaint is lack of commentary during any of the episodes. Still, the assorted extras (included on a separate DVD) more than make up for this.

Bottom line: if you were a kid back in the 60's...this SHOULD be required purchasing/viewing (along with Gilligan's Island - my other guilty TV pleasure from that era).",1455408000,23,839,4.6938775510204085

My Dad, may God rest his soul, and I used to watch it together when I was that age and then I continued, never missing a single episode, rushing home after school to see how Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder would survive the evil ensnarements of their underhanded arch-foes!  But now I don't have to wait another day or a week or even an hour because the entire series is mine!  ALL MINE!  I thank WB and FOX for FINALLY after all these years putting out the entire series (even if at first putting it out piecemeal season by season).  It only took me a week to go through the entire series once and now I'm going back through it again (even though my wife's getting tired of hearing the theme music over and over again, but I'll NEVER tire of it! *smile*)  You have a very satisfied customer in me my friends.  I'd be even MORE satisfied if you could find me a REAL, BONAFIDE, NON-PIRATED set of the entire Green Hornet series.  That would make my dreams come true and I would sing Amazon's praises for life!

Sincerely Yours,

Leslee L. Gordon

PS - I have an acquaintance whose wife bought him the set for Christmas from Best Buy and he's had to return his set to the store THREE TIMES because of playing defects (he has Blu-Ray, but isn't that supposed to be BETTER than my DVD?  *chuckle*)!  I told him to buy Amazon the next time!  I got mine first (before Christmas) and haven't had a single problem! - LLG",1453593600,5,1536,4.303135888501743
6504182,5,B00LT1JKN2,"This Complete Series looks fantastic. The colors are sharp and everything is crisp. Almost too crisp, you see the sheen of sweat on Batman's lip and the veins sticking out on Gorshin's forehead. You get a 32-page Episode Guide with a Greeting From Adam West. The show is presented as ""standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of the original exhibition"" - a long way of saying 4:3 TV viewing. (Though my player's Widescreen setting works pretty well, also.) Sound is Dolby digital mono.

With it's guest villains and multiple cameos, this hilarious ""Batman"" series is perfect for trivia. Here's some questions for you, test yourself! If you don't want to wait to watch the series, I give the answers in the first comment to this review:
1.  Who was the guest villain in the very first episode?
2.  Who was the very first oh-so-comely moll?
3.  What is the significance of 2F-3567?
4.  Riddle me twice, Batman. What kind of pins are used in soup? And what was Joan of Arc made of?
5.  What is the first gadget used from Batman's famous utility belt?
6.  A bust of what famous person sits on Bruce Wayne's desk, and hides the switch for ""Access to Batcave via Batpole""?
7.  When was the first episode where someone opened a window to address the Dynamic Duo while they're climbing a building wall?
8.  Who was the first person to open a window?
9.  Who was the last villain to bedevil our heroes in the TV series?
10. How many miles is it from the Bat Cave's street entrance to Gotham City?
11. Of Batman's top 4 villains, which one appeared in the most episodes of the TV show?
12. Who was the guest villain in the 2-episode show with the highest ratings?
13. To whom was Commissioner Gordon referring when he said, ""Who knows what devious tricks this evil balladeer could be up to.""
14. Of the three actresses who played Catwoman on the series and ""Batman: The Movie"", who was Adam West's favorite?
15. Adam West asks this question himself, in Special Feature No. 5, ""Inventing Batman"": ""This would be fun at parties. Trivial stuff. What was the first ""Batman"" comic balloon?""
(He refers to the cartoon-y ZAP! BAM! that appears during fights.)

I like this show because I cannot watch it and not be happy! Chief O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon say the most atrocious lines with a straight face (""Our only hope is that towering power for right and justice, the Caped Crusader""). Everything is tongue in cheek (a beauty contest called ""Queen of Beauty"", an exclusive perfume called ""Canadian Perfume""). Double entendres galore (as Julie Newmar says in Bonus feature No 3, ""C'mon! You can't miss it!""). Thirty-three guest villains in all. Innumerable minions, with appropriate names (such as Leo and Felix for Catwoman, Finella for the Penguin). TV shows in this era were known for encasing their female guest stars in wigs, but the costumiers went wild in ""Batman"" (including an odd toupee for Van Johnson). Impossible weapons and torture devices. GREAT guest stars, and that's not even including the cameos and window-openers. Great one-liners (Robin says, ""That puncuated pipsqeak!"").

Season 1 has 17 two-part shows, or 34 episodes of 25 minutes each without commercials. Season 2 has 30 two-part shows, with 25 minutes per episode. And Season 3 has 26 one-part shows, of 25 minutes each. That's a total of 3,000 minutes or 50 hours of excellent viewing.

You can listen to the show in English or French (except Season 3). Or you can watch it with subtitles in English, French or Spanish.

The seven Bonus Features are all on the last disc in the Season 3 set. The Bonus Features are the same whether you're buying DVD or BluRay. The viewing options are fewer for the Special Features. There is no dubbed option, and subtitles are available in only Spanish and Portuguese. The Complete Series has 225 minutes, or 3 3/4 hours, of Special Features.
...1. ""Hanging With Batman"" (2014, 29 minutes) This featurette is narrated by Adam West, and includes clips from interviews with him over the years. West had played serious roles before ""Batman"", but he wanted to get into comedy. That's just one reason he loved the 1st script when he got it, ""Batman - some of you don't realize this - was a comedy.""
...2. ""Holy Memorabilia Batman!"" (2014, 20 minutes) I really enjoyed this bonus. ""Batman"" was the first TV series to have ""a firestorm of collectibles"". Commentators include Adam West, Ralph Garman (Batman collector), Jordan Hembrough (host of ""Toy Hunter""), Kevin Silva (Batman Collector) and Mark Racop (owner ""Fiberglass Freaks""). There is a great analysis of collecting - it gives you permission to dream.
Garman shows Adam West his full-room collection, from originals when the show was airing to recent new stuff. It is very touching. West even tries on one of the prizes in the collection, an original cowl that Adam wore in the show. It still fits perfectly.
Racop made his first '66 Batmobile in 1974 when he was 17. Now you can buy a fully functional replica from him, complete with a retractable bat beam antenna. And flame thrower, if you insist!
...3. ""Batmania Born! Building the World of Batman"" (2014, 30 minutes) This short has 22 commentators, historians, publishers, producers, writers. It's a little analysis of why ""Batman"" was successful in 1966 - 1968.
...4. ""Bats of the Round Table"" (2014, 45 minutes) Adam West is joined at a restaurant by Ralph Garman, Phil Morris (actor, ""Smallville""), Jim Lee (Co-publisher DC Comics) and Kevin Smith (Executive producer ""Comic Book Men""). All are big fans of the '66 Batman and they talk about what the show meant and means to them.
...5. ""Inventing Batman: In the Words of Adam West"" (2014, 65 minutes) Adam West is at Warner Studios and is loaned his original script for the Season 1, episodes 1 & 2 in the series, ""Hi Diddle Riddle"" and ""Smack in the Middle"". The script has West's hand-written notations. We re-watch the two episodes with West periodically showing us his notes and what he was thinking as he created this new character. Of the script, West says, ""It was written by the great Lorenzo Semple Jr., who said, 'It's the best thing I ever wrote.' And he won a number of awards for screenplays.""
West: ""You can be as absurd as anyone imagines, but if you do it with a certain, almost invisible, ineffable dignity... Dignity, and the sense to the audience that you're doing everything you can to preserve that dignity. That becomes very funny.""
...6. ""Na Na Batman!"" (2014, 15 minutes) Twenty-four commentators bring up different points about ""Batman"".
...7. ""Bat Rarities! Straight From the Vault"" (21 minutes total)
.......A. ""Batgirl Pilot"" (1967, 7 minutes) This was a short to see if they would develop a new series, ""Batgirl"". Instead, Yvonne Craig joined ""Batman"" for the 1st episode in Season 3, as Commissioner Gordon's daughter. She became crime-fighter Batgirl, and only the butler Alfred knew she was Batgirl.
.......B. ""Burt Ward Screen Test With Adam West"" (6 minutes)
.......C. ""Actors Screen Tests: Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyall"" (5 minutes)
.......D. ""James Blakeley Tribute"" (3 minutes) Blakeley was post-production supervisor for ""Batman"".

I'll put in a plug for two other releases:
....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Movie-Special-Edition/dp/B0016MOWPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Movie (Special Edition)</a>
The Movie came out in July, 1966, a month after the last episode aired of the smash hit Season 1. This link is for the 2008 DVD Special Edition, presented in widescreen 1.85:1. It includes an OK commentary track, by Adam West and Burt Ward, and 7 other bonus features. In my review (buried amongst the other enthusiastic reviews), I detail a ridiculous conversation in Commissioner Gordon's office - proof that the writing for the movie was every bit as zany as for the TV show.

....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Holy-Batmania/dp/B0002W4UXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman - Holy Batmania</a>
This 2-disc set has the 109 minute made-for-TV documentary, plus a 90 minute biography of Adam West, 85 minute biography of Julie Newmar and a 45 minute biography of Cesar Romero. I like the documentary, but the biographies are the cream. Disc 2 does have screen tests as bonus extras.

The photo added shows Batman dancing the Batusi in Episode 1.

It has many of the greatest talents of all time:  Caesar Romero, Julie Newmar, Milton Burl, Vincent Price, and it goes on and on.  My favorite of the rogue's gallery is Burgess Meredith as Penguin.

I'm sure the younger generations scoff at me for enjoying this but on the other hand I can't stand Heath Ledger's Joker(there I said it)!  So I'll eat my can of beans and they can eat theirs.

The Features were fantastic, and it includes the un-aired  mini episode introducing Batgirl facing the Killer Moth, played by Tim Herbert. I have waited since 2002 for the tv series to be released, and I was pleased when ME TV started airing episodes in 2011, most of which I hadn't seen in over 40 years since about 1970 in syndication. Almost none of the Batgirl episodes. And Retro Toon started showing season 1 episodes, with the Riddler, my favorite villain, and False Face, and The Bookworm.  I was Really pleased to receive this set. Not as much stuff as there is in the Blue ray box set, and no Hot Wheels Batmobile. It was a colorful show in 1966 when I was 10, and it is easy to see why it was the most eagerly awaited dvd and/or Blue ray release among all shows. We children had lots of fun pretending to be Batman and the boy wonder. I am enjoying being 10 again. The only thing I regret about Batman is that after season 1 there was only one more appearance by Frank Gorshin as The Riddler. But now we have these priceless momentos of the 1960's preserved for us to enjoy yet aagain. It doesn't have The Batman TV movie from 1966, but there are some good features in there, and I recommend it. Enjoy!",1444176000,3,1345,4.333333333333333

6504294,5,B00LT1JKN2,"I love it.

Batman was, and is, a wonderful series, full of campiness and other fun. Finally, I will be able to see, for myself, how Alfred figured out that Barbara Gordon was Batgirl. (I know from the web, but it's not the same thing.) This set, I might not donate to the library.

I wish that Batman had lasted more than three seasons, but it gave us a wonderful set of villains to work with, and it was fun to compare the comic books to the TV shows.

Even in the third season, when most of the episodes were half-an-hour long, they did manage to include some interesting traps.

My problem with the show was that it aired when I was 15-17, and they'd get into the trap on Wednesday evening, no problem there, but Adult Choir Rehearsal was Thursday night, so I had my brother or sister record the audio on an old brown reel-to-reel recorder so I could at least hear how they got out of the trap, then see how they got out when summer reruns finally arrived. One time, I actually waited, saw them get out of the trap, then ran to church (hard to do with a heart murmur.)

I'll keep watching this on MeTVNetwork on Saturday nights, but it's going to be wonderful to switch over to the discs, 25 minutes instead of however much they are airing on MeTV.

These are worth getting ... na na na na na na na na na Buy This

6504316,5,B00LT1JKN2,"I was two years old in 1966 when this series premiered and four when it finished its run in 1968 so I have no first hand recollection of it.  I discovered it in the early Eighties when I attended college and it ran on the local UHF channel during summer break.  It was all the rage among my peers for its irreverence and campiness.  When the ""Batman"" film came out later in 1989 one was forced to reevaluate the Caped Crusader in respect to director Tim Burton's darker vision.  Christopher Nolan conception of the Dark Knight in his superlative trilogy offered the most definitive version of the Batman ethos.  In light of what transpired since the ""Batman"" series left the network airwaves how does it hold up today?  Remarkably well in my humble opinion.  I think the best way to view this series is  in sequential order taking note how the series evolved over the course of its run.  You will see its shift in tone is gradual and not that dramatic.  It is then you will see that every one of the 120 episodes, good and not so good, is of a piece to a satisfying whole not unlike the initial ""Star Wars"" trilogy or Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" cycle.  For sure there are some clunkers like ""Surf's Up, Joker"", the sexism of ""Nora Clavicle's Ladies Crime Club"" and John Astin's  misinterpretation of the Riddler but they aren't a deal killer.  I paid $99.99 for this set and consider it a bargain.  If anything the series is a font of delicious trivia when you consider all the guest villains and cameos. Bring on ""The Green Hornet""!

Love how Boy Wonder always finds a clue for Batman to take the credit for. These two guys rock the tights pretty well. They could beef up some and add some muscle , but they don't wanna. I could sit at home stuck from a blizzard for a week and not get tired of watching this series.

6504381,5,B00LT1JKN2,"Being just eight when this show debuted, it was my first exposure to the character of Batman, and I was quite surprised, years later, when I found out Batman had been penned in the comics as ""The Dark Knight"". There is absolutely nothing dark about Adam West's rendition of the character.

In this age of infomercials and reality TV, reruns have become a thing of the past, but I've really been enjoying revisiting the show via the newly released DVDs of this short-lived sensation. Looking back on this show nearly 50 years later, I just don't know how the players kept a straight face with their intentionally cheesy lines. Neil Hamilton, a film actor of some prominence from the silent era through the 1930's, is just great as the stone-faced Commissioner Gordon. I didn't even know his place in film history until years later when I got into classic films.

And as for Adam West, I've always admired his great positive attitude about his short lived fame. Through the years he's often parodied his role in commercials and you could tell he was really enjoying himself and poking fun at the character he once played. The DVDs have a long interview with Adam West and he really is a great guy. Now in his 80's, West just said he felt very fortunate to have had work as an actor throughout his career, to have good friends and a great family, and to have been part of such a big part of 60's TV culture, even if for a short time - what a class act who did not let fame go to his head.

Now for the show itself. Everybody wanted to be a guest star villain, and many did. As well as the original villains from the Batman comics such as the Riddler, The Penguin, and The Joker, there were some added that were unique to the series such as Victor Buono as King Tut. The odd thing about Tut was that the show actually showed the origin of Tut as a criminal - a respected Egyptologist who was hit on the head and became an arch criminal when not in his right mind. He was also one of the rare villains for which Batman seemed to have compassion. Nobody ever wondered why The Joker wandered around in loud suits and makeup or why The Penguin never got tired of smoking cigarettes ala FDR and wearing a tux.

Then there is Robin, who is actually Batman's young ward Dick Grayson. Dick is actually in high school, and at Wayne mansion Bruce Wayne is always lecturing Dick about the importance of good diet, exercise, education and seat belts. Yet, that doesn't prevent Bruce Wayne as Batman from putting someone not of legal age repeatedly in harm's way. And harm never seemed to mean mere gun play. Instead it was the danger of being eaten by giant clams or being sawed in half by a buzz saw. You couldn't say Gotham's criminals lacked imagination.

Finally an observation about Batman in relation to ""Wild Wild West"", both of which aired at about the same time in the 1960's. Wild Wild West had good ratings, but the show's producers decided to cancel because CBS said the show was too violent, when the fight scenes were no worse than Batman's fight scenes. Maybe they should have added some cartoon KAPOW!, OUCH! and POW!. Seriously, add those captions into the Wild Wild West fight scenes and you would have had the same thing.

So if you have some time and spare cash, get the Batman DVDs and watch one of the great fads of television that people still remember fondly 50 years later. And see if you notice the little jokey touches like Ma Barker's buxom daughter's prison number being ""35-23-34"" and the fact that Robin's bat pole was smaller than Batman's pole. Phallic humor for the ages. Highly recommended.",1428710400,,3609,4.5022900763358775

6504465,5,B00LT1JKN2,"How is it possible that this outrageously entertaining TV show came to exist?, one may ask who has been raised on the ham and cheese of the TV universe that has been blowing smoke for the last 35 years or so.  Batman was a product of a short window in the late 60s during which free-wheeling imagination was king.  Along with other classics like the Munsters and the Beverly Hillbillies, Batman is purely subversive fun driven by way over-the-top writing full of insanely comic situations and characters.
When I was first initiated to Batman during its reruns in the mid-70s, although I was vaguely amused by the show, more than that I took it seriously.  For good reasons too - for a 10-year old kid, the show was pretty dark.  In every 2-episode plot, at some point, Batman and Robin are stuck in some kind of torture device that suggests horrid suffering and death.  But the combination of comedy, darkness, and just plain 60s-hip scenarios (the Batmobile roaring out of the Batcave with fire blasting out never gets old as far as I'm concerned) makes the show really unique.  It was odd that it was lumped in on the roster of kids' shows not only because of the aforementioned darkness, but also because so much of the dialogue and various interludes reek of adult satire, but me and a whole generation of kids were fine with it.  Watching it now, I can't stop laughing - Adam West's Batman deadpanning absurdly square lines, Frank Gorshin's insanely giggling Riddler, the sexy Julie Newmar preening in her cat's den, Victor Buono's King Tut carrying on with his crew of hipster criminals (including Sid Haig at one point!)  And a who's who of the hip late 60s scene populating the landscape in every show.
One can easily dismiss it all as a bunch of silliness, but that would be missing the point.  The show was in tune with the fun-loving and hip attitude of the times in the late 60s and as a result delivers the silliness in an inspired way.  And on top of all this, there are 120 brilliant episodes, so the fun keeps coming for a long time.",1422403200,8,2049,4.55858310626703

6504468,5,B00LT1JKN2,"Campy and crazy as I ever remembered it to be, the extraordinary energy and compatibility of the incomparable Adam West and Burt Ward were what made this television series work -- along with a memorable cast of A-list actors who brought to life the characters of Commissioner Gordon, Alfred the butler, and the star-studded group of ""villains"" that we will never forget.

The costumes were impeccably designed for color and eye-appeal, the stories were ridiculously cheeky and fun, and the show established its own memorable style and presentation for television in a much different, much more innocent world.  No language here, no steamy themes, no PC, and no commentary other than raising up the best standards of the American way of life with an eye toward decency.  The only thing noticeable in its content -- keeping in mind the innocence of the period and the culture of the time -- was a considerable amount of tobacco and smoking, more often than not because of the Penguin and his long cigarette holder.

It was the Sixties, and reflects that culture in every respect, at a time when some of the other big shows were Bonanza, Star Trek and The Monkees.  All in all, this is a great presentation of the entire series, well organized and accessible, with a few extras thrown in.  This is strictly for fans, who appreciate the work in its context, love Batman and Robin, and can enjoy the campy environment of the stories and characterizations.  For anyone who loves Sixties television, this boxed set is a MUST HAVE -- unless you want or need Blu-Ray quality (which early TV was not) or what the extra stuff that comes with the larger Blu-Ray set (toy Batmobile, cards, books.)

I am still pouring through it since Christmas, and memories of a cherished childhood are still coming back to me through the BAM! POW! and ZOWEE! of this golden era of TV.",1421712000,5,1857,4.745341614906832

and for those that just never grew up.
You can now step back to the 60's, and a time that changed the
history of this country.
And Batman was right in the middle of it, with it's cars, clothes, and hip
attitudes, not to forget a lot of things, that were not in common use back
in the mid 1960's.
As, the years passed by, we lost many of the people, you will see in the
show,but their roles will never be forgotten.
Enjoy watching all 120 episodes again, and share them, with an age group,
that only remembers, Batman in the movies.

6504565,5,B00LT1JKN2,"After having watched this show with my kids on MeTV for over a year now, when we heard this would be coming to home video, it was basically a foregone conclusion that we would have to get it.  Despite the steep price tag, Batman is insanely fun to watch, and the costumes and psychedelic sets look truly amazing remastered.  For those who haven't seen this show in awhile, it's a great introduction to superheroes (not to mention camp) for kids, with none of the ""realistic"" grit and grimness of modern super hero films.  For adults, the show is much, much funnier and bizarre (in a good way) than you remember, and despite the formulaic plots, the over-the-top-in-the-best-way-possible performances are the real draw.  The quality of this boxed set cannot be overstated.  I don't care too much about extras in this type of thing, but the packaging and design of the whole thing is top notch, and, considering this is probably the end of the DVD age, this may be the last set like this that I will ever need/want to buy!",1419724800,2,1020,4.613259668508287

6504584,5,B00LT1JKN2,"FINALLY!  How excited am I that this series is finally out on DVD?  I grew up watching reruns of this show on the Family Channel in the afternoon after school.  I loved the bright colors, the fun costumes, and the hilarious rogue's gallery of Batman Villains.  As much as I love the new, dark Batman from the Chris Nolan films, Batman for me will always be the one I grew up with: campy hijinx with Adam West and Burt Ward.  This is one of the few superhero movies or TV shows that feels like it comes out of the comics...saturated colors, the infamous word balloons (Pow! Zap! Zowie!), and a parade of famous guest stars stepping in to play Batman villains, some very familiar (Joker, Riddler, and Catwoman) and some less familiar or created for the series (Marsha Queen of Diamonds, The Siren, and False Face).

Vintage fun for Batman fans - don't expect any of the darkness or ennui that characterizes modern interpretations of Batman.  This is a great family friendly interpretation of the Batman.  Youngsters used to a more action-packed Caped Crusader will probably roll their eyes, but for those of us who grew up with this Batman, either as it originally aired in the 60s or in rerun, it's about time that this gem finally came out on DVD!

I'm also glad that they put the whole series out in one shot, rather than stretching the release out season by season.  We've waited long enough!",1419206400,,1394,4.584677419354839

I thought the WHOLE POINT of answering the thousands of fans that didn't feel like getting (or simply couldn't afford) the LIMITED edition Blu-ray was to make a regular unlimited set CHEAPER! (The LIMITED was US 175 bucks at release day, US 149,99 now because I sent them information this was the price at Best Buy and that I was buying there - they matched it later in that day, too late for me)

Before the release date (11/27/2014) and right now (12/20/2014), this regular unlimited Blu-ray is costing 215 bucks! (and it went down to US 179,99 only, still more expensive than the LIMITED, before coming back to the current US 215...)

6504676,5,B00LT1JKN2,"With it's guest villains and multiple cameos, this hilarious ""Batman"" series is perfect for trivia. Here's some questions for you, test yourself! If you don't want to wait to watch the series, I give the answers in the first comment to this review:
1.  Who was the guest villain in the very first episode?
2.  Who was the very first oh-so-comely moll?
3.  What is the significance of 2F-3567?
4.  Riddle me twice, Batman. What kind of pins are used in soup? And what was Joan of Arc made of?
5.  What is the first gadget used from Batman's famous utility belt?
6.  A bust of what famous person sits on Bruce Wayne's desk, and hides the switch for ""Access to Batcave via Batpole""?
7.  When was the first episode where someone opened a window to address the Dynamic Duo while they're climbing a building wall?
8.  Who was the first person to open a window?
9.  Who was the last villain to bedevil our heroes in the TV series?
10. How many miles is it from the Bat Cave's street entrance to Gotham City?
11. Of Batman's top 4 villains, which one appeared in the most episodes of the TV show?
12. Who was the guest villain in the 2-episode show with the highest ratings?
13. To whom was Commissioner Gordon referring when he said, ""Who knows what devious tricks this evil balladeer could be up to.""
14. Of the three actresses who played Catwoman on the series and ""Batman: The Movie"", who was Adam West's favorite?
15. Adam West asks this question himself, in Special Feature No. 5, ""Inventing Batman"": ""This would be fun at parties. Trivial stuff. What was the first ""Batman"" comic balloon?""
(He refers to the cartoon-y ZAP! BAM! that appears during fights.)

I like this show because I cannot watch it and not be happy! Chief O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon say the most atrocious lines with a straight face (""Our only hope is that towering power for right and justice, the Caped Crusader""). Everything is tongue in cheek (a beauty contest called ""Queen of Beauty"", an exclusive perfume called ""Canadian Perfume""). Double entendres galore (as Julie Newmar says in Bonus feature No 3, ""C'mon! You can't miss it!""). Thirty-three guest villains in all. Innumerable minions, with appropriate names (such as Leo and Felix for Catwoman, Finella for the Penguin). TV shows in this era were known for encasing their female guest stars in wigs, but the costumiers went wild in ""Batman"" (including an odd toupee for Van Johnson). Impossible weapons and torture devices. GREAT guest stars, and that's not even including the cameos and window-openers. Great one-liners (Robin says, ""That puncuated pipsqeak!"").

And now I can geek out by using pause button to see if I can tell from just where Batman pulled the Bat Shield.

This Complete Series looks fantastic. The colors are sharp and everything is crisp. Almost too crisp, you see the sheen of sweat on Batman's lip and the veins sticking out on Gorshin's forehead. You get a 32-page Episode Guide with a Greeting From Adam West. The show is presented as ""standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of the original exhibition"" - a long way of saying 4:3 TV viewing. (Though my player's Widescreen setting works pretty well, also.) Sound is Dolby digital mono.

Season 1 has 17 two-part shows, or 34 episodes of 25 minutes each without commercials. Season 2 has 30 two-part shows, with 25 minutes per episode. And Season 3 has 26 one-part shows, of 25 minutes each. That's a total of 3,000 minutes or 50 hours of excellent viewing.

You can listen to the show in English or Portuguese. Or you can watch it with subtitles in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese.

The seven Bonus Features are all on the last disc in the Season 3 set. The Bonus Features are the same whether you're buying DVD or BluRay. The viewing options are fewer for the Special Features. There is no dubbed option, and subtitles are available in only Spanish and Portuguese. The Complete Series has 225 minutes, or 3 3/4 hours, of Special Features.
...1. ""Hanging With Batman"" (2014, 29 minutes) This featurette is narrated by Adam West, and includes clips from interviews with him over the years. West had played serious roles before ""Batman"", but he wanted to get into comedy. That's just one reason he loved the 1st script when he got it, ""Batman - some of you don't realize this - was a comedy.""
...2. ""Holy Memorabilia Batman!"" (2014, 20 minutes) I really enjoyed this bonus. ""Batman"" was the first TV series to have ""a firestorm of collectibles"". Commentators include Adam West, Ralph Garman (Batman collector), Jordan Hembrough (host of ""Toy Hunter""), Kevin Silva (Batman Collector) and Mark Racop (owner ""Fiberglass Freaks""). There is a great analysis of collecting - it gives you permission to dream.
Garman shows Adam West his full-room collection, from originals when the show was airing to recent new stuff. It is very touching. West even tries on one of the prizes in the collection, an original cowl that Adam wore in the show. It still fits perfectly.
Racop made his first '66 Batmobile in 1974 when he was 17. Now you can buy a fully functional replica from him, complete with a retractable bat beam antenna. And flame thrower, if you insist!
...3. ""Batmania Born! Building the World of Batman"" (2014, 30 minutes) This short has 22 commentators, historians, publishers, producers, writers. It's a little analysis of why ""Batman"" was successful in 1966 - 1968.
...4. ""Bats of the Round Table"" (2014, 45 minutes) Adam West is joined at a restaurant by Ralph Garman, Phil Morris (actor, ""Smallville""), Jim Lee (Co-publisher DC Comics) and Kevin Smith (Executive producer ""Comic Book Men""). All are big fans of the '66 Batman and they talk about what the show meant and means to them.
...5. ""Inventing Batman: In the Words of Adam West"" (2014, 65 minutes) Adam West is at Warner Studios and is loaned his original script for the Season 1, episodes 1 & 2 in the series, ""Hi Diddle Riddle"" and ""Smack in the Middle"". The script has West's hand-written notations. We re-watch the two episodes with West periodically showing us his notes and what he was thinking as he created this new character. Of the script, West says, ""It was written by the great Lorenzo Semple Jr., who said, 'It's the best thing I ever wrote.' And he won a number of awards for screenplays.""
West: ""You can be as absurd as anyone imagines, but if you do it with a certain, almost invisible, ineffable dignity... Dignity, and the sense to the audience that you're doing everything you can to preserve that dignity. That becomes very funny.""
...6. ""Na Na Batman!"" (2014, 15 minutes) Twenty-four commentators bring up different points about ""Batman"".
...7. ""Bat Rarities! Straight From the Vault"" (21 minutes total)
.......A. ""Batgirl Pilot"" (1967, 7 minutes) This was a short to see if they would develop a new series, ""Batgirl"". Instead, Yvonne Craig joined ""Batman"" for the 1st episode in Season 3, as Commissioner Gordon's daughter. She became crime-fighter Batgirl, and only the butler Alfred knew she was Batgirl.
.......B. ""Burt Ward Screen Test With Adam West"" (6 minutes)
.......C. ""Actors Screen Tests: Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyall"" (5 minutes)
.......D. ""James Blakeley Tribute"" (3 minutes) Blakeley was post-production supervisor for ""Batman"".

As noted, almost all of the bonus extras above are new and not carried forward from the bonus extras on ""Batman: The Movie"" or the TV Special ""Batman - Holy Batmania"". While I'm at it, I'll put in a plug for these, too.

The Movie came out in July, 1966, a month after the last episode aired of the smash hit Season 1. This link is for the 2008 DVD Special Edition, presented in widescreen 1.85:1. It includes an OK commentary track, by Adam West and Burt Ward, and 7 other bonus features. In my review (buried amongst the other enthusiastic reviews), I detail a ridiculous conversation in Commissioner Gordon's office - proof that the writing for the movie was every bit as zany as for the TV show.

Hard to get now, I bought my DVD copy some time ago. This 2-disc set has the 109 minute made-for-TV documentary, plus a 90 minute biography of Adam West, 85 minute biography of Julie Newmar and a 45 minute biography of Cesar Romero. I like the documentary, but the biographies are the cream. Disc 2 does have screen tests as bonus extras.

The photo added shows Batman dancing the Batusi in Episode 1.

6504689,5,B00LT1JKN2,"Like many Batfans who grew up watching the Adam West-Burt Ward version of the Dynamic Duo, which originally ran on ABC-TV from January 1966 until March 1968, and is still in reruns on the Memorable Entertainment Television (MeTV) digital classic television network, I am delighted that this great series is finally out on DVD (and Blu-ray).  Although I have not watched all of the episodes - that will take some time - I am very impressed with what I have seen so far; the quality is far superior to the MeTV repeats. All 120 episodes are here, divided up as follows: Season 1 is on 5 DVDs, Season 2, which had the most episodes, is spread over 8 DVDs, and Season 3 (the Batgirl era) has four discs of episodes, plus a bonus disc of special features including mini-documentaries on Adam West's life and career; the explosion of Batman memorabilia since 1966; reminisces from the show's stars, including West, Ward, and Catwoman Julie Newmar; current Hollywood stars discussing their favorite Batman moments; a segment where West reads from his annotated script of the two-part pilot, while watching the actual episodes (this is as close as we get to a commentary track on the episodes; sadly, there are none on the regular DVDs); outtakes from the vault, and much more.

Warner Home Video and Twentieth Century-Fox have teamed up to do a great job on this series, which includes a softcover guide to all 120 episodes in chronological order, and descriptions of the bonus material that follows.

Five stars for this whole package. DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA - BATMAN!!

UPDATE: There are a couple of minor errors with this package - one with the missing narration at the beginning of the first episode, ""Hi Diddle Riddle,"" and the second on the episode ""Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds."" Though it only represents about 5 minutes of footage, Warner Brothers Customer Service is offering replacement discs. Go to their Web site for additional details and how to register to obtain the replacements. I received the replacement discs (Discs 1 and 8) several weeks ago.

6504692,1,B00LT1JKN2,"To my American friends/readers-
The ""review"" below reflects defective product purchased through Amazon.ca in Canada,not through Amazon.com in your fine country. However I put it up as a reminder to all to always check your discs when you receive them. And I hope Warner's choice of manufacturers for this set in the States was better than whom they chose in Canada. Good luck and enjoy your purchase.

""Warners has finally released Batman the TV series. As wacky and campy as this show was,it still remains a fan favourite and mine. Adam West,Burt Ward and the rest of the company played their parts straight down the line while uttering dialogue that would make ones eyes roll more often than not. But that was its' inimitable charm. I took a brief look at an ep and boy they look like they were filmed yesterday, they are so clear.
Unfortunately I must report that we may have a bad run of sets here. I received mine and checked my discs. Out of 18 discs in this set I found only TWO....that were playable. All had varying degrees and sizes of scuffs,scratches and tick marks. I was gobsmacked. Each season folds out and the discs have their own plastic sunken holders,while others pancake over each other. Each disc I found was firmly in place when I received the set. Therefore one can only conclude it is not Warners or Amazon's fault,but a manufacturing problem(well Warner's picks out its' manufacturers so maybe they are partly to blame).I phoned up Amazon who were most gracious(as always) to send out another. The replacement set also had only TWO good discs.*throws hands in air* Needless to say both are winding their way back for a refund as I write this.
This release joins the Hall of Shame of DVD releases alongside such stalwarts as The Complete Laurel and Hardy Collection,The Get Smart Collection,Combat-The Complete Series,The Complete Lost Episodes of the Honeymooners,Deep Space Nine,The I Love Lucy Collection,The Complete Flintstones,and many others I have reviewed over the years. The total lack of quality control just boggles the mind.
It is my fervent hope some of you can eventually get a proper set without defects. I do wish you well,and enjoy what looks like a wonderful release. Just remember to always thoroughly check your discs,especially in this case where the odds are stacked against you.""",1415923200,45,2328,4.89367088607595

I liked the series all right and it's good that Adam West & Burt Ward now tolerate each other enough to let this old time favorite TV series be finally released on video but why do DVD buyers get no love anymore? DVD still sells at least as much as BluRay does but the cool extras only go with the Bluray sets in an effort to coerce more money out of us for what's pretty much the same thing. Shame on you DC!

6504696,5,B00LT1JKN2,"it's hard to know where to start. what should i express first, my joy that it's made it to DVD at long, long last, or my still tingling frustration that it took so damn long?
my Batman of choice is Adam West, first last an' always. i don't have a problem with ""dark"" superheroes per se, i just think there are other characters who are better suited to it. like Wolverine, for instance, or Daredevil, not to mention that mold from which Batman was cast in the first place, The Shadow. Batman, on another hand entirely, was at his most potent (not to mention unique) in the ""theatre of the absurd"" motif where i first met him.
the '60s was hands-down the Golden Age Of American Television, and Batman is a textbook example of the wonderfully iconoclastic sensibility you'd almost think the Industry was going out of it's way to sidestep today. just look at the sitcoms. in the '60s just about anything could happen on a sitcom, whereas the sitcoms of recent decades almost seem to be taking pains to clone each other. it always seems to be the same everyday rut set in the same mundane living-room or office motif.
so it miffs me to hear so many of my favorite American tv series - Gilligan's Island, The Addams Family, The Munsters, The Monkees, and of course the all-time best, Get Smart - dismissed as ""kid stuff,"" but at least so-called kid stuff takes a certain imagination, a certain spirit, that you're never gonna get from the prosaic day-to-day ""real world"" of an Arrested Development or a 2 Broke Girls.
nor, strictly speaking, is it ""kid stuff"" in the derogatory sense generally suggested. maybe in the sense that it'll appeal to kids, but that hardly obligates it to exclude adult sensibilities. quite the contrary, one of the delights of my adult life has been rediscovering the old series who's reruns i loved as a kid, and realizing how multi-tiered the approaches tended to be. they frequently walked a tightrope between innocence and sophistication and made it look like the easiest thing in the world. (as C.S. ""The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe"" Lewis said, a children's story that adults can't enjoy as well is not a good children's story.)
this is bound to sound redundant, since it's being stated, restated, and re-restated in these reviews, but like so many i had to grow up to fully recognize the spoof quality. i'm not saying it was completely over my head. even as a kid i'd always liked humor, so i knew that the occasional development was being played for the laugh. take the time Batman was almost married to Marsha Queen Of Diamonds (Carolyn Jones). his salvation comes in the form of Alfred (Alan Napier) and Aunt Harriett (Madge Blake) in the guise of his true wife and her lawyer. asked why he didn't mention that there was already a Mrs. Batman, our hero stammers ""it slipped my mind."" or the way that Catwoman (Julie Newmar) ostensibly ""dies"" more than once, demonstrating her nine lives. jokes that blunt are pretty obvious at any age.
so i always recognized and appreciated that the series had a sense of humor, but it took a few decades for it to dawn on me that it was predominantly, rather than intermittently, a satire. one episode, for instance, concerns J. Pauline Spaghetti, who made her millions with pasta. how many kids even then would've known who J. Paul Getty was, and therefore gotten the joke? or, take the time a certain ""pompous waddling master of fowl play"" ran for office. every kid will understand why you don't want The Penguin (Burgess Meredith) in office, but how many will makes head-or-tail out of the accompanying political satire? it also occurs to me that when Batgirl (Yvonne Craig) was introduced, it might've been intended as a pun on Marlo Thomas' new sitcom, That Girl.
another good example: on one occasion Batman asks why they always manage to outwit their opponents, and Robin surmises ""because we're smarter than they are."" to which Batman replied that he prefers to think ""our hearts are pure."" corny as i now realize they were consciously setting out to be, that would've sounded positively inspirational when i was 10 or 12.
given the similarly iconoclast comedy maestros of whom i've since become a fan - The Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, Monty Python - if anything i relish the series even more now than i used to.
many fine comedies (Dr. Strangelove and This Is Spinal Tap, for instance) simply present an absurdity rather than trying to ""riff"" on it, and therein lies the genius of Adam West. he masterfully takes the piss out of the goody-two-shoes ""square"" character that more button-down age expected the hero to be, by doing no more than playing the standard rulebook of the age to the hilt. there are times when he comes off like Sgt. Joe Friday at a costume party. (""for indeed, no man is above the law, and no man is below it."")
and he balances the two elements are artfully as could ever be done. this driven-snow version of Batman could've come off as a full-fledged prude if played by anyone but West.
one of the major shocks of other versions for me is the lack of Robin. (after all, would you rob Sherlock Holmes of Dr. Watson or The Lone Ranger of Tonto?) i don't know if the concept of a teenage ward just works better from this satiric angel or what, but certainly Burt Ward's presence brings something. his role as pupil for the stodgiest class of grownup advice may be the prime example of the series' straight-laced spoofery. then again, maybe it's simply that West and Ward managed to attain that much sought but too indefinable to be manufactured quality known as chemistry. the all-time great ""comedy double act"" is of course Abbott & Costello. but West and Ward unquestionably have a place alongside Gilligan and Skipper and Herman and Grandpa Munster amongst the first runners-up.
it's been said more than once that the most heroic hero is nothing without an equally formidable villain, and the series certain did it's duty in that department. it's been argued more than once that the villains were the real stars of the show, and that Batman himself is basically an emcee. i'm not sure i'd go quite that far, but certain the series doesn't exactly dispute the long-standing stereotype about the villains being more interesting. even in the reruns i recall how vividly one tingled, waiting to learn who the ""special guest villain"" was this time around. the actors always clearly revelled in the role, and a number of distinguished players - Julie ""Catwoman"" Newmar, Burgess ""Penguin"" Meredith, Frank ""Riddler"" Gorshin, Victor ""King Tut"" Buono, Vincent ""Egghead"" Price, Cliff ""Shame"" Robertson - achieved their most lasting fame and most ardent audience affection in the process. (Meredith certainly did something right, because he made something fun out of the single blandest villain character in comic-book history.) most famously, Cesar Romero made a deal to wear that Joker makeup, provided he didn't have to shave his trademark mustache, and in the process completely eclipsed literally decades of the ""Latin lover"" roles he was trying to maintain.
it's interesting to note that the impressions they leave don't depend upon quantity. for instance, Bookworm (Roddy McDowell) and False Face (Malachi Throne) loom so large in my mind that i'm still waiting for it to sink in that they each threatened our heroes only once (at least while the camera was rolling). whereas The Mad Hatter (David Wayne), whom i'd completely forgotten, appears twice. go figure.
if i have a bone to pick with the series, it's that poor Batgirl was so underused. granted it's more circumstance than anything else, since she was introduced so late in the series, but i still have to regret that poor Yvonne Craig didn't get to develop her promising character very far. (if nothing else, she should've gotten a chance to tussle with Julie Newmar's definitive Catwoman, rather than having to settle for Eartha Kitt's understudy version.)
actors frequently tell us that comedy is the most difficult genre to perform, and i get the feeling that parody is the most difficult brand of comedy. because for all the fun it makes of conventional storytelling techniques, it's ultimately just as dependent upon them. an audience needs to connect with, to root for, Austin Powers just as much as they do James Bond.
i must admit, alas, that there is another factor. (yes, i know i've already said this, but since it applies here it has to be said in order to complete the report.)
when Tim Burton's first Batman film came along, i'd reached junior high with literally no idea that the producers of the series had taken any liberties with their source material. it was all over the news how this was to be a more ""faithful"" approach, and the different flavor of the nuances was a bit jarring, to say the least. what really tipped the scales, though, is that it was around the same time that I discovered old-time radio. in that process i came upon the original superhero, The Shadow. i'm not suggesting that it was an exact carbon-copy - where Batman wore a costume, for instance, The Shadow was armed with ""the hypnotic power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him"" - but for all dramatic intents and purposes they boiled down to the same basic ""creature of the night"" motif wielded by a ""wealthy young man about town"" who happens to be chummy with the police commissioner of New York/Gotham City. the most (if not only) significant difference is that The Shadow's adversaries never have the gimmicky affectation of a Riddler or a Catwoman. so it's close enough: this theoretically more ""legit"" version of Batman turned out to be a product of plagiarism at it's most shameless.
that's official, by the way. Batman ""creator"" Bob Kane always freely admitted, in fact pretty much bragged, to having liberally appropriated his basic character from The Shadow and his storytelling technique from Dick Tracy.
so this series may very well be ""camp"" (whatever the hell that means), but it's also a few other things that more recent depictions of Batman are not, such as unique and original. this is the one version where Batman manages to get out of The Shadow's, well, shadow and become something unique in himself.",1415750400,13,10179,4.777525539160045
6504697,5,B00LT1JKN2,I am very happy with this LONGGGG overdue release.  The packaging is great.  Adam West will always be my favorite Batman.  No armor is needed.

great just like the cartoons and other classic tv shows of the 60's when I was a kid. I agree the price is way too much! The studios could care
less about what real fans want just long enough for them to make BIG money on shows that collectors have been buying selling for years.
It's amazing this took so long to be released! I'll continue to watch on Me TV until the price goes down. way down! But this series is a classic.

The Blu-ray edition costs $180. That works out to $1.50 per episode. The SD version costs $135. That works out to $1.13 per episode.
Those are actual numbers. The number of seasons is really irrelevant for this program, as it ran many more episodes than the average primetime series. Season 2 alone had 60 episodes!

This DVD set, finally released *officially* for the first time ever - and eagerly anticipated by Batman fans, isn't bargain-basement cheap by any means, but it isn't gougingly overpriced either.",1411862400,8,678,4.886956521739131

It's been at the top of many wants lists for years and one of the most requested releases EVER. Here it is, at long last! We've been assured that it will be completely complete, batclimbs, teasers, ""IN COLOR"", it will all be there. The show was made on film and has been mastered in high-definition, so it should look glorious and far better than any syndicated repeat ever has.

I can't believe people are giving this one-star ratings based solely on the price tag. It's true, it's a pretty expensive set but remember, in those ""only three seasons"" you get one hundred and twenty episodes, because the second season is enormous!  Plus, the studios have to make some money back, since sorting out the fiendishly complex rights issues and royalties for the vast array of guest stars the show features has undoubtedly been extremely expensive. The rights issues that held Batman back from shiny disc for so long (no, it wasn't the studios just stubbornly ignoring people) are likely the most complex and difficult of any show in existence. I'm actually amazed that we're actually getting this at all. As well as utterly delighted...

From the opening theme song to the Batcave to the Batmobile to Batman and Robin themselves - what American boy wouldn't have fallen in love with that show??

I was much too young to catch the scripted campy aspects of this great series; for me this was deadly serious stuff (ha!)  How in the world were Batman and Robin going to get out of the jams that they found themselves in every Wednesday night??  A nation simply HAD to tune in the following evening at the 'same bat-time, same bat-channel!'

I met Adam West and Burt Ward this past April at a Comic-Con convention where I live in St. Louis, Missouri.  I told them how much they were a part of my childhood.  The simple truth is that the characters of Batman and Robin knew the differences between right and wrong - and they stood for righteousness.  As an impressionable five year old boy, I soaked it in.  Batman and Robin's words and actions were gospel to an entire generation of boys.

I look forward to purchasing this DVD series when it becomes available!",1407196800,5,1189,4.458333333333333

6504777,5,B00LT1JKN2,"....there was pressure put on ""The Powers That Be"" by Bat-Fans to finally get the 1966-68 ""Batman"" TV series released on DVD this year (2014) so it would coincide with the 75th anniversary of Batman's comic-book debut (in a 1939 issue of Detective Comics).

Nevertheless, this is a release that is years overdue!

""Batman"" was just about the only hit TV series of the 1960's that had never received a DVD release.

And the best part is that at the end of Part One of each Bat-Story (all the episodes in Season One, nearly all episodes in Season Two---there were a couple of three-part episodes that year---and some episodes in Season Three were two-parters), you don't have to wait ""Until Tomorrow, Same Bat-Time, Same Bat-Channel!"" to see the conclusion.

To be fair, the two-part cliffhanger format in Seasons One and Two (the show was broadcast on Wednesday and Thursday evenings) was the reason the show became a hit. All day long on Thursdays during 1966, millions of Americans, from schoolchildren at recess, to housewives chatting with their neighbors, to corporate executives in boardrooms, discussed what would happen in that night's episode. We all knew Batman and Robin would escape this week's predicament, what America wanted to know was HOW.

The show can be enjoyed on two levels. If you're under fourteen or fifteen years old, you'll find it a derring-do adventure show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you're an adult, you'll find it a hilarious spoof.

I first saw this series at age ten (when it was first broadcast), so even watching reruns now, I don't even giggle, because of when I first saw it. Had I first seen it as an adult, it would have been different. Very different.

This will likely become one of the biggest-selling TV series on DVD ever.....unless the Joker gets dumb enough to break into Amazon warehouses and steal the DVD sets, replacing them with sets loaded with his lame jokes  ;)",1406505600,7,1932,4.7807807807807805

It's great to see such TV classics getting released and it's even better that in many cases the relevant studios/companies are seeing fit to digitally restore/re-master them too.

Now those of us interested should keep making noises hoping to alert the relevant companies/studios of the demand for other old classic TV series such as Hawaiian Eye, 77 Sunset Strip, The Eve Arden Show and last but not least Adventures in Paradise (with Gardener McKay) - I know there's a vile bootleg crudely copied from TV version going around but I am talking about a proper digitally restored/re-mastered version like they are doing with Batman.

6504782,5,B00LT1JKN2,"The price does seem high, but if you do a little comparison shopping it's actually pretty much in line. Amazon currently has this set listed at $149.99. That's for 120 episodes, which breaks down to $1.25 per episode. By comparison, the latest season of the Big Bang Theory is listed for $29.99 for 24 episodes, which breaks down to (wait for it) $1.25 per episode. So, for all the legal wrangling, and rights issues, and cameos and others who need to be paid, the set costs just as much per episode as a current TV sitcom. And of the 589 reviews on their page, 501 are 5 star, with no mention of the price as a reason not to buy. Game of Thrones charges $35 for 10 episodes--that's $3.50/episode.

As for the show itself, I've spent many, many years waiting for this to come out, and will happily buy as soon as it is available. Some of my happiest memories were watching reruns at my grandparents' place on summer vacation and seeing the POWs, SPLATs, and KAPOWs flash across the screen, with no murders, and justice always wins. Batman is my favorite superhero to this day because of this show,and the chance to see a pristine, uncut copy of it--yeah, I'll buy.",1406332800,16,1164,4.490566037735849
6504783,4,B00LT1JKN2,"Many folks are complaining about the price of this set. Let's break it down some. 3 Seasons 120 shows for $200.00. That's around $65.00 per Season. Not that bad. Considering we have been waiting 15 years for this I for one will be buying it.

Think first before you give a 1 star review. Distributors read these reviews. Remember what happened to the Tom & Jerry Golden Collection Volume 2. That could be the same fate for Batman if Warner Brothers gets nervous about sales.

If you really feel the price is to high than wait it out. In a year or so the price will drop. I CANNOT WAIT! I'm buying it on November 11th.

UPDATE:
I have received my set and viewed several shows. First off, the packaging is terrible. Warners used the plastic tray holder with discs overlapping each other. Not a good choice, they should have used simple ""keep sake"" cases.
Back in the 1980's I taped many episodes from WPIX CH 11 here in New York. I have a Betamax copy of ""Instant Freeze"" from Season 1. Well, the taped from TV print, which was 16mm has vibrant colors and no negative wear. the copy on the DVD has weak color, almost brown in tone, and several scratches on the print. I'm hoping this is not a standard thru the whole box set.
Don't get me wrong. I'm glad to own this series on DVD, and will enjoy it for years to come. However, I wish more care was given to this release.",1406332800,8,1369,4.2984496124031

20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. seemed like a never ending issue,impossible to resolve,,until now! since Batman is a DC Comics
property,which in turn,is owned by Warner Bros.,and the 1966-1968 TV series,which put ABC-TV on the map,and made the Caped
Crusader an icon of the 1960s-and what an impact he was! like millions of other Baby Boomers,i lived through 1966,and there wasn't a day that didn't go by,without having this iconic charecter in the background,via the mechandising,which WAS a Hot property for any Batfan back then! but in its three year run on ABC,the 120 episodes was PURE fun,escapism,and good family entertainment-and the
comicbook sales for National Periodical Publications-known today,as DC Comics,was also impressive! so its really hard to pinpoint
any one of the millions of reasons why this show is highly loved-but in those special moments in 1966,it was impossible to ignore the
impact of this TV show-that was real fun,and a pleasant childhood memory! so to have and buy the complete TV series-so longly
awaited,this will be a total JOY,as well as a welcomed addition to fans and film buffs,who know the value of ""Batmania"",decades before Michael Keaton's groundbreaking 1989 movie,and the Franchise to follow! i highly recommend ""BATMAN"",especially for those,who pondered on what all the fuss was about back in those days,,they have no idea!! to see Adam West and Burt Ward twice
a week on ABC,was pure nervana! in Fall 1966,all the Networks went to Color-and if you were watching ABC-TV,you'd see the shows opening with the ""IN COLOR"" credits-and ""BATMAN""-In Color,was just an exiting way,to watch this show! i hope Warner Home Video and Twentieth Century Fox will include many of the ABC Promos-and including Batman's appearance on ""THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE"", a serious ABC gem,of a variety series,the best of its kind! as many viewers know,Twentieth Century Fox
released a full length BATMAN movie in August 1966,which has been the ONLY segment availible from the series,until this coming
November-finally! the next TV show i hope will also see a release,is ""THE GREEN HORNET"",since William Dozier also brought that
to ABC in Fall 1966,which stars Bruce Lee as ""Kato"",and Van Williams as ""Brit Reid/The Green Hornet""-and the duo also appeared
as a window cameo,and later in the ""Piece of The Action/Batman's Satisfaction"" episode. BUY this DVD set,and i promise you,you'll

This is the original 1960's television series that we all know and love. Finally, it is being released for the home video market. Thankfully, we Bat-fans can now breathe a huge sigh of relief. Al 120 episodes will be featured. Once again, you get to see Frank Gorshin (and John Astin) as the Riddler, Caesar Romero as the Joker, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin, Julie Newmar (and Ertha Kitt) as Catwoman, and so many other extra special guest villains. Take a trip back in time with America;s favorite caped crusader and boy wonder.",1406246400,2,694,4.840336134453781

6504814,5,B00LT1JKN2,"Here's five stars for this show. This is just as ridiculous as the one and two star reviews here, for a product that has not been released yet. Please AMAZON, consider a format change in the review area. Before items are released allow no reviews, but have a forum where the upcoming product can the discussed. After product release the forum can be archived or deleted if need be. This would legitimize the reviews.

6504815,1,B00LT1JKN2,"Ha ha ha, that price is a joke!  This was a great show, but I was looking for a 59.99$ price tag or so.  At that price, I'll just wait for when it drops.  Very disappointing.  I'll just hold on to my bootlegs a little bit longer. Look at the Incredible Hulk Complete Set...  Now I know it doesn't compare to the beloved 60's Batman series, but it was still pretty good.  When i bought that back in 2011, the entire box set (5 seasons) was only 29 bucks.  The price has risen since then, I see.  But the prices are always swinging from high to low...  I just hope this price drops...",1406246400,24,582,4.079646017699115

6504818,5,B00LT1JKN2,"Holy Batmania, bat fans! It's official! To understand the importance of this DVD set... A few years ago a number of blogs took polls and asked fans of classic TV what programs have not yet been released to DVD that fans are begging for. THE WONDER YEARS, WKRP IN CINCINNATI and BATMAN were among the top three. This year, 2014, those goldmines are being excavated from the Batcave. Of course, many of us knew it was coming not just because official BATMAN (TV series) merchandise has been released to the market, but celebrities were leaking advance word. Months before Conan O'Brien leaked word that BATMAN was finally coming out on DVD, and Warners had to confirm (but could not provide a street date at the time), Julie Newmar (CATWOMAN herself) was at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Maryland in September 2013. When asked during a Q&A panel on stage why the BATMAN TV series had not yet come out on DVD, she remarked, ""I wouldn't know since I don't own the property... but I can tell you that I recently recorded audio commentary for many episodes for an upcoming DVD release..."" And the fans in the room shouted and cheered. Many announced what they heard on Facebook and Twitter but like anyone posting such news, it was assumed to be gossip... until Conan O'Brien.

Adam West and Burt Ward since acknowledged participation with the DVD release (most likely audio commentary) and this set is supposed to be LOADED with bonus extras. Screen tests, audition films, bumpers and promos... you name it.

The only question that still remains: legal holdouts always prevent certain purifications. Are all the music cues and scenes going to be intact? Remember that WKRP IN CINCINNATI years ago came out on DVD (Season One) with most of the music replaced and fans were angry. But every music cue had to be licensed and paid for... causing the price to go up. (TV reruns work under the original 1960s contracts and the terms of those contracts are perpetual. For DVDs, new contacts have to be signed and there's usually someone who thinks they don't have to sign unless they are being promised millions.) So if you are shaking your head and questioning why the expensive price for BATMAN, remember that the more expensive the set -- the more complete, intact and uncut the series will be on DVD. Fans have stated that they don't mind paying more for a perfect set. And after all, isn't that what we want? Amazon.com also promises the lowest price so if the price lowers between now and the November release, you'll pay less.",1406160000,240,2532,4.73922902494331
8667863,5,B00LT1JKN2,"So, now I have to think about Howard Stern talking to George Clooney saying how Batman should always be a dark and gloomy character? No reason to say that other than George was just terrible in that part, anyway. At any rate, for many devotees, this will always be ""The Batman.""

Hard to pick a single favorite moment or even a bad episode--so many great villains, so many luscious women--if I had to rank the seasons, Season 1 might still be unbeatable, but Season 3--where the show supposedly slipped--is still great, maybe better than the previous, if Frank missing as the Riddler is bad (it is).

No Julie or Lee as Catwoman, either, but I still know the Bat-girl jingle. Overall, a lot of ""Bat-Fun"" reliving this show....",1533600000,,726,4.6640625

I have been wanting to get this Series for quite some time. Now that I have it I don't know why I waited, oh yes because of the price. When I saw it for under $50 it was time to buy! Video quality is great, though some might find it a little over saturated I think it plays well with the dynamic contrast in color. Audio quality is on par for a program of that era. Now, let's hope they release the Green Hornet series next.",1531094400,,547,3.981818181818182
