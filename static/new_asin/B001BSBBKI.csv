3499612,2,B001BSBBKI,"This movie fooled me as it's sort of funny and horror related all at the same time.  The story does not have much to it, and the only truly good actor...the only actor...was Bela Lugosi.  I got the movie thinking it had to be great if Lugosi was in it, but even a great actor can't compensate for a poor story ...which drags at times. The movie was so slow, I literally fell asleep watching it 3 times. I had to start it again and again.
And not sure why they colorized this movie either. The ""monster"" is just an octopus in a aquarium.  When they colorized it they used a bright blue background.  The monster is supposed to be attacking some men at night!  Special effects don't exist in this movie.
Not a favorite for me and I am a true B-movie fan.",1299715200,,751,4.1875
3499613,5,B001BSBBKI,"Irresistible Monogram film. At the top of the list of movies that qualify for genre So-bad-that's-it's-good. Poverty Row films were filmed in 2-5 days with cardboard sets, wierd music (if any), preposterous plots, bad acting by actors required to wear their own clothes instead of being supplied with costumes, etc..
Bela is known for appearing in about 10 of these amusingly ghastly films. However--Lugosi always gave it his All, no matter how dreadful the script or working conditions. He never dissapoints; he never ""walked through"" a role. One of the true Immortals...",1253059200,2,572,5.228260869565218
3499614,4,B001BSBBKI,"First of all,let me clarify something:Tor Johnson does not say ""time for go to bed"" in this movie,but it was the turkey ""The Unearthly"" starring John Carradine instead. Second,please do not take this movie seriously,even thought it tries to be. At least in Ed Wood's mind,that is. This is a bad movie,but still lots of fun. Third,Ed Wood was NOT the worst director. That award goes to Coleman Francis who did the awful ""Red Zone Cuba"" and The Beast of Yucca Flats"";just to name a couple..The octopus in this movie was taken from a John Wayne movie,which,by the way,they forgot to get the motor that made it move. Plus,Mystery Science Theater 3000 did this movie to hilarious affect,but if you just want to watch the movie by itself,then I say,Go ahead! because it is fun to watch. As is ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"",too..I don't know if it's the bad editing or the bad acting or the goofs or maybe all three,so just sit back and enjoy!",1234137600,,932,4.586826347305389
3499615,5,B001BSBBKI,"Legend Films presents ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER"" (11 May 1955) (68 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- Dr. Eric Varnoff (Bela Lugosi) captures twelve men for his experiment: to turn them into supermen using atomic energy. Newspaperwoman Lawton gets too snoopy for her own good --- If you do not know Ed Wood then this movie will have little meaning to you --- So the first thing you have to do is learn about the life of Ed Wood --- He is one of the worst directors of all time, but also one of the most colorful. Bride of the monster is a good example of his ability to make the most out of his scarce resources --- You'll love it or you'll hate it -- Have fun!

Under the production staff of:
 Edward D. Wood, Jr.  - Director / Producer / Screenwriter
Alex Gordon  - Screenwriter
Ted Allan  - Cinematographer
William C. Thompson  - Cinematographer
Frank Worth  - Composer (Music Score)
Warren Adams  - Editor
Tony McCoy  - Associate Producer
Pat Dinga  - Special Effects
William L. Nolte  - First Assistant Director
Jane Huizenga  - Production Director
David D. Martin  - Technical Director

Story line and plot, Many person are vanishing in the Lake Marsh, nearby an old mansion recently bought by Dr. Eric Vornoff (Bela Lugosi) --- He lives with Lobo (Tor Johnson) and has an octopus in the lake, product of his experiment in developing somehow atomic energy --- Janet Lawton (Loretta King), a reporter of a tabloid, decides to investigate further the disappearance of locals and is abducted by Dr. Vornoff --- Her fiance, Lt. Dick Craig (Tony McCoy), together with the police force, goes to the old house looking for Janet. This story, expected to be a horror movie, is indeed a funny entertainment due to the lack of talent of Ed Wood --- When we watch an Ed Wood's film, we know that it will be a movie full of flaws --- But why do we like him so much? --- Could it be since Tim Burton promoted this director, he became a cult personality --- There are unbelievable mistakes in framing and edition, such as, for example, about 36 minutes running time, we can see the microphone over the heads of Janet and Dr. Vornoff --- The performance of the cast is so ridiculous that becomes really funny --- The motionless octopus in the `lake' is also funny. And what about the screenplay, a kind of Frankenstein meeting the Loch Ness monster, with hilarious dialogs? --- This film is a great entertainment vehicle, especially since it has been colorized by Legend Films.

3499616,5,B001BSBBKI,"Though mostly recognized for his ""work"" on the perennial dud Plan 9 From Outer Space, Ed Wood's prolific career creating the best-bad movies in Hollywood extended well beyond that infamous film to an entire library of B-movie classics.  Bride of the Monster is one of the director's ""high"" points, teaming everyone's favorite architect of nightmares up with the Plan 9 dream-team, a then-living Bela Lugosi and the Super Swede, Tor Johnson.

God only knows how Wood kept wrangling a screen legend like Lugosi into doing these horrendously bad movies, but future generations will thank him for the resulting campiness and hilarity.  If the thought of poor dialogue, horrendous sets and even worse editing rocks your socks, you're in for a special treat!

If you're going to buy any version of Bride of the Monster, you'd be best served by getting this particular DVD.  Legend Films--friend to all B-movies--provides two versions of the film on the same disc: the original black and white version and their new, color-added version.  You're welcome to take your pick of the two based on personal preference, but if you have yet to try the colorized version, you might as well indulge.  When I compared the two side-by-side, I could not help but enjoy the colorized version more--it adds so much vibrancy and life to the images on screen.  Maybe I've been spoiled by decades of realistic imagery in film, but I'm reticent to return to grayscale after having seen Bela, Tor and the octopus monster in their enhanced forms.",1227571200,3,1518,4.948818897637795

8284942,5,B001BSBBKI,"Both B/W and colorized versions look fantastic. The fun extras include an interview with Bela Lugosi and a color Pippi Longstocking (?) TV sketch featuring Tor Johnson as ""The World's Strongest Man"" in which he acts just like his character Lobo.

My only complaint is the cover art. It's creepy (in a bad way) and badly designed. It looks like Bela's nose has been replaced with a tiny blonde woman with Cthulu-esque tentacles. It doesn't evoke the look and feel of an old Ed Wood production. This is Ed Wood, not H.P. Lovecraft. Why not just use the original movie poster illustration or a new retro style design?

But for the price, it's an unbeatable deal. Highly recommended.",1467158400,4,679,4.745762711864407
8284943,5,B001BSBBKI,"I reviewed the VHS which I have had for long time being a Lugosi fan and finally got the DVD cheap but the quality is about the same. The movie
is still GREAT! Lugosi like Karloff and Price and Cushing always gave their best despite some of the material they had to work with and the
cheap production values on some of their films. Lugosi is prefect for this role and Wood wrote a very good script much like or even better than
some of the classic Universal horror films. What he didn't have was a big budget and great actors except for Lugosi and the actor who plays
the homicide captain and the doctor from Lugosi's homeland and Lugosi gives a great performance when they finally meet. The directing is
actually pretty wood and much better than most B movies from this time! and it's not the worst film ever made! as some have commented.
This is a must have for Lugosi and classic horror mystery movies! Bride of the Monster was Lugosi's last great film.",1456185600,,956,4.406779661016949

8284946,5,B001BSBBKI,"This is an Ed wood classic. It includes the regular ""actors"" night/day scene confusion, rubber monsters, and stock footage interjected regardless of background. Wrestler Toj Johnson, veteran of 31 films, provided his expertise being able to play a mute (unless whipped) a role he would encore. This was the era when cars looked like tanks and bras were fashioned after bullets. I'm not sure the title was truly fitting. And what was that major league mushroom cloud at the end?

They don't make films like this anymore, well unfortunately they do.",1423526400,2,547,5.010989010989011

8284948,3,B001BSBBKI,"It has Bela Lugosi & Tor Johnson in it with a big rubber octopus and Ed Wood directing, how can you not?
The plot is stupid...
The acting is cheesy....
The props are every day household items, like a metal salad bowl......except the rubber octopus, which wood purchased at some prop shop without the mechanics to make it work so the actors had to do all the work.......
I don't know anyone who hasn't seen this movie but...........SPOILER ALERT!...........if you haven't seen it stop reading!
......................................................
Bella's sinister machine is turned on him at the end and he runs into a giant (actually another actor wearing obvious platform shoes) and he kills Lobo, then runs on a rampage on the hillside behind his lab and is crushed by a boulder and forced into the pit with the octopus.
The doctor, now ""juiced"" up with atomic radiation is struck by a bolt of lightning and explodes into a giant mushroom cloud of atomic radiation, meanwhile our heroes stand nearby unharmed and the police chief says something prophetic (curtain call).......cheesy
You just can't help but like this movie......",1366934400,,1132,5.091397849462366
