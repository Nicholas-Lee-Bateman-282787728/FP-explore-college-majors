8568586,3,B00BHLTJ5I,"Eight action movies, starring four different action heroes. Two theatrical releases, six direct-to-video ones. Four Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles, two Steven Seagal yarns, one Dolph Lundgren adventure, and one...Val Kilmer movie. Yes, Kilmer's little-known action/thriller feels a little tacked on, but by and by, this is a decent sampler of mid- to low budget adrenaline outings, allowing you to see most of these stars on both their good and bad days of filmmaking.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-The-Return/dp/B000022TSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier: The Return</a>&nbsp;was the last solo vehicle for Van Damme to get a theatrical release, and sadly it's no match for its more bombastic prequel. The smaller budget shows in the reduced scope of both the setting and action, but the eventual showdown between Jean-Claude and Michael Jai White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dynamite/dp/B002BWP3W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dynamite</a>) is worth waiting for.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knock-Off/dp/0767821548/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knock Off</a>&nbsp;is the second collaboration between Van Damme and director Tsui Hark, and it's definitely one of the star's oddest outings. There's an obvious strong Hong Kong flavor to the humor and action, but at least in the case of the latter I don't think it's fully taken advantage of...save for one cool fight wherein Jean-Claude wards off a small army of attackers in a warehouse, Jackie Chan style. Most of the supporting roles are played by Chinese performers, which helps give this one its alternative flavor. Van Damme would never make an authentic Hong Kong picture, but this is as close as he'd get.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Second-in-Command/dp/B000ENUYH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Second in Command</a>&nbsp;is the first film of Van Damme's with a modern military setting. Production values are good and the filmmakers keep the European location from looking as boring as many other DTV titles do. Our hero interacts well enough with his onscreen squad, but the result of having him be part of a team is a reduced emphasis on his character. The action is solid but far from breathtaking. Had the movie been made ten years earlier, it'd have bee a regular blockbuster for Jean-Claude.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hard-Corps/dp/B000GDH9IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hard Corps</a>&nbsp;is my favorite Van Damme vehicle included here. With an emphasis on character development and some strong dramatic performances, the film has an unusually long runtime - just under two hours - but holds your attention throughout. The action's not JCVD's best work but is still pretty gritty and personal, including the boxing match with costar Razaaq Adoti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amistad/dp/0783231202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amistad</a>).

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Force/dp/B000ION79Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Force</a>&nbsp;may be the very worst picture Steven Seagal has ever starred in. The movie's plot was infamously altered in post-production, resulting in ridiculous amounts of voice-dubbing and body-doubling for Seagal's character. The action has a sci-fi tinge, featuring Steven armed with blades attached to his wrists and the ability to blast people through walls, but it somehow isn't very fulfilling. As if that isn't bad enough, the consistently dark cinematography is also pretty depressing.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Sun/dp/B0006VL1IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Sun</a>&nbsp;largely makes up for the last one's blunder, being one of the aesthetically richest vehicles of Seagal's DTV days. The colorful Tokyo setting is always fun to look at, Seagal speaks Japanese at length, and a lot of the action - especially the swordfight finale - is very good. On the downside, the story could definitely use some streamlining and a few of the character deaths didn't have to be quite so mean-spirited. This one's theatrical release in Japan was well deserved.

In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Russian-Specialist/dp/B000CQ98FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Russian Specialist</a>, Lundgren gives a strong showing as both an action star and director. The story drags a little and is at times fairly sadistic, but the action is satisfying - especially Dolph's hand-to-hand fights - and for the second time on this collection, a generic European setting is somehow made to look fairly interesting. It's arguably the best feature Lundgren ever helmed as a filmmaker.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conspiracy/dp/B0011VIO4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conspiracy</a>&nbsp;examines themes of postwar trauma, the status of veterans and the physical handicapped, and aggression towards immigrants, but in the end we still have a fairly disappointing movie here. Unlike his cohorts in this collection, Kilmer doesn't strike me as the kind of action hero who can excel on the DTV circuit, and this relatively tame action film exemplifies that.

The collection is far from perfect, but especially action fans who haven't seen the majority of these movies would probably appreciate it for at least one or two of the films.",1388448000,3,5596,6.675824175824176
