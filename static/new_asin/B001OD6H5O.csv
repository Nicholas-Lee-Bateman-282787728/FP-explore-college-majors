3729775,5,B001OD6H5O,"This is the first drum solo DVD I've purchased since I tend towards fusion/tribal and haven't seen a lot from that style.  I have taken workshops with Zoe and really enjoy her dynamic dance style.  That said, I love this DVD!  Zoe and Issam both let their personalities shine through, which made it really fun and a lot like taking a workshop in your home.

The warm-up is conducted more through dance movements and building the foundation for the rest of the DVD.  The warm-up alone is a welcome addition to my DVD collection.  I absolutely love doing yoga to warm up but it's nice to have a change of pace as a warm up to get my dance practice started.  I also love that, even while Zoe takes time to explain what she's doing, there isn't really a lot of stopping and starting, which really makes the warm up more effective.

The drum solo choreography is broken down by the different rhythms used.  Each rhythm is then broken down by Issam, the movements broken down by Zoe, and then that section executed by Zoe with Issam.

The combination of Issam and Zoe explaining the rhythms is awesome.  Issam is an amazing drummer, as we all know, and was very clear in explaining the different sounds produced, the fundamental rhythm, and how he will make a variation on it for the choreography.  One of the [many] things I want to learn as a dancer is recognizing the fundamental pattern being played by a live band, and having the rhythms covered like this really helps.  Then Zoe goes over what a dancer will want to emphasize within the rhythms and then gives an example in her signature style.

I don't really watch choreography sections of DVDs to learn something to perform.  I watch them to get ideas for my own performances and I found this very valuable.  I've danced to live drums and there's easily a tendency to just kind of want to go nuts and hit every single beat and emphasis.  But just like bellydancing to any other kind of music, there needs to be a contrast between strong hits/locks and fluid movement.  Zoe goes over this brilliantly (I am biased because I absolutely love her style of dancing).  Also important, is that Zoe makes it clear that there should be communication between the dancer and the drummer and subtle things that can be done to make a drum solo look really good.

Most of the DVD is conducted with Zoe facing the camera.  The end of the sections, where Zoe dances to Issam's drumming are done with Zoe facing the mirror and the camera off to the left and behind her.  The warm-up is done in voice-over with the rest of the instructional done with sound and video at the same time.  It works really well and the voice-over-matching-video problems that were in Tribal Fusion Fundamentals aren't in this DVD (thankfully!).

The sections are never strung together and run through in this manner.  Instead, it's done like a performance, with Zoe in costume facing the camera.  There is an improvisational section that isn't covered in the choreography part of the DVD but I think most dancers using this DVD could follow along from the performance or insert something themselves.  The DVD clocks in with a runtime of 82 minutes, and there is a *lot* of information in it, so I'm certainly not going to complain about not having a run-through from a particular angle or having an improv section broken down.  The performance is done twice, once with just a full shot of Zoe and Issam, and the other with the crazy cuts BDSS loves to use (they aren't *that* bad here - then again, maybe I'll watch it again after being more familiar with the choreography and go, ""Wow!  Zoe's really beautiful but do I really need a close up of her face while she's doing all this other stuff down below?"")

The instructional is clearly not meant for true beginners.  There is no time taken to explain the fundamental moves of bellydance and Zoe even puts in things like flutters to the choreography; she does provide alternatives to moves dancers might not be comfortable with though.  It's more a tool for the dancer who is interested in expanding his/her repertoire to include the drum solo but is looking for ideas on how best to interpret Middle Eastern rhythms.",1235952000,39,4182,4.601889338731444
3729777,5,B001OD6H5O,"I love all things by Zoe Jakes.  Have not had the opportunity to use this much yet, but so far I am loving it.",1355011200,,110,3.5833333333333335
3729778,4,B001OD6H5O,I already knew I am not trained enough yet to do most of this dvd. I do the stretching and warm up regularly and learn small bits at a time. The performances at the end are good to watch for inspiration.,1352592000,,203,3.975609756097561
3729779,5,B001OD6H5O,"Tribal Drum Solo Choreography is so awesome! Issam is a master drummer and musician with much depth and talent. One who truly can give you good measure to being a good musician. As for Zoe Jakes, her wild behavior speaks for itself to who she is! Despite her professional attitude and amazing talent, Zoe has humor that will leave you remebering her always! Not only is this instructional video very good, Zoe makes it hilarious and fun to watch. Making it hardly the boring dance instruction video you may have thought it was at first. This DVD is well worth the investment!",1320105600,,575,4.647058823529412
3729780,5,B001OD6H5O,"This DVD is actually for a dancer whom is either intermediate, advanced, or a professional.

Even a number of the warm-ups will be too difficult for a beginner, especially a person totally new to belly dance.

When it comes to the choreography, which is the entire point of the DVD, it's VERY difficult and hard to follow, because it's so advanced, and you will often need to turn, and get really confused. (Don't let that discourage you tho'.)

There are some really great aspects of this DVD:

It shows the humor and personality Zoe is known for. She's absolutely like that in real life if you go to classes of hers (and I've already been to 2 of her classes).

The warm-ups are exactly like the ones she teaches in her classes, and the DVD is cheaper.

If you are new to belly dance, you will want to mostly stick to just going through her warm-up daily. The warm-up its self is what makes the DVD worth the price. But, it could be a long time for you to ever make it to a level where you could follow along with the choreography instructions, because it's often hard to follow. It has NOTHING to do with her teaching ability, she's great, but the camera angles hurt your ability to really learn the choreography, plus the fact that you often turn around. So, how can you watch what the next moves are, and what they are supposed to look like, when your back is facing the screen?

However, I've known of intermediate and advanced dancers be able to get through the lessons, and learn some of the choreography without any problems, because they are more experienced with it.

Other good aspects about the DVD is that she's totally made an entirely different technique for dancing to ancient rhythms, they're entirely nontraditional, she will give commentary about each one, and they are explained by Issam as well.

It's also not boring.",1317686400,,1840,4.5683890577507595
3729781,3,B001OD6H5O,"There is very good practice warm ups for this video, though you may have to rewind and replay them for a while in order to get them right I don't particularly do the choreography so much as it seems that during the instruction she's doing so much talking but she doesn't explain the moves in such an understanding way; however she's doing a lot of explaining. I have found that it's easier to just watch her moves with the DVD player in slow motion and then I can execute them better than just listening to her explain them.",1310256000,,524,4.357142857142857
3729782,5,B001OD6H5O,"to the millionth degree. Not only does Zoe break down the sections by rhythm, but she breaks down the combos and moves in a way that is easy to understand but not overly simplified. I would not suggest for beginners, but would strongly suggest it for intermediate and advanced dancers who want to improve their technique and understanding of drum solos. A wealth of information and ideas ...",1309824000,,391,4.764705882352941
3729783,5,B001OD6H5O,So here is the thing.... Zoe is the a great instructor! Her personality is addictive and reminds you how to have fun! I am a beginner meaning I CAN NOT DANCE! To be honest I did not think it would be much of a work out. I WAS WRONG!!!! This dvd is awesome! Please don't get jammed up thinking this is too advanced this video BREAKS IT DOWN! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Issam is a rock star and I even bought a drum because his instruction is easy to follow! BUY IT! You will have fun .....and you just might surprise yourself!,1307664000,,519,4.048543689320389
3729784,4,B001OD6H5O,"I love zoe and wanted to give it 5 stars, but at times this was hard to follow because she was turning in too many directions. Its hard to copy someone when you're having to keep turning around to look at the tv screen. Other than that though, good video.",1296432000,,255,4.12
3729785,3,B001OD6H5O,"I've taken two workshops with Zoe and think she is an absolutely fantastic dancer and teacher. In her workshops, she really takes the time needed for you to perfect every move and teaches tips and tricks to make certain moves easier and more crisp. She also has a fun, engaging personality. I think these qualities do not come across as well in her DVD. One example is how she teaches her turns. In person, she is very strict about bending your knees to protect them and will make you repeat the turn until bending your knees comes naturally. In the DVD, she does not even mention bending your knees. It makes a difference - if you buy this DVD, keep your knees bent on all the turns - for the whole turn. Your knees will thank you later!

Overall, I'd say it's worth it to buy it if you want to learn a little about drum solo. The breakdown of different rhythms was helpful, and I learned a few new moves that I'd like to try. I liked the warm up, but she goes through it so quickly, and does not really describe what's she's doing out loud, so it's hard to follow along the first few times. The main reason I gave it three stars rather than four is that I wish she would consistently state what she's doing as she does it the first time. This is particularly a problem because her legs and feet are not visible and she is facing a camera at an angle, so it takes a lot of effort to figure out which foot she's standing on and which direction she is going next.

I think the DVD is valuable for: 1) learning about drum solo if you have no experience; 2) learning some new ideas that are probably Zoe specific (like her turns). But I think it would take a lot of watching this DVD or a lot of rewinding to feel like you've learned a new choreography.",1281916800,,1750,4.205357142857143
3729786,5,B001OD6H5O,"Quick shipping, nice DVD quality; but the packaging was very poor - without any protective foam coating, so the item could have been easily damaged on the way.",1270512000,,159,4.714285714285714
3729797,4,B001OD6H5O,"If you haven't gotten to take a workshop with Zoe Jakes, you'll love this DVD, which isn't JUST a breakdown of drum solo choreography.  It's also an excellent warm-up and Fun With Zoe.  Zoe is fun, and so is Issam.  They're funny, informative, and thorough.  You'll learn a LOT from this one, beyond the choreography itsself.  Zoe gives in-depth explanations and breakdowns of why she uses what choreography WHEN in the piece.  Issam teaches a rhythm class as the DVD goes along.  This is insightful and enjoyable, like a workshop with Zoe and Issam that you can take over and over again!",1263600000,,588,4.705882352941177
3729798,5,B001OD6H5O,"what can I say ?! my best choice so far while picking up a DVD in the long list of instructional DVD for bellydance and tribal fusion.
Good warm up, good explanations. Not for beginners though as mouvements are not precisely explained. It is a real good guide to create your own combinations on different types of rythms. But you can also enjoy Zoe's combos that she's sharing on this DVD. Fun to watch, fun to do. I would have loved a bit more information concerning her spins which are so specific.
A must have !",1251504000,,514,4.364583333333333
3729799,5,B001OD6H5O,"I like everything about this dvd, especially the fact that there is no ""This is a hip drop, this is a omi, etc."" It's not a beginner video! Zoe is a great instructor and Isamm's teaching is 'must know' if you want to create your own tribal choreography for a drum solo. My favorite thing about this DVD is that it is not so stiff and boring from the instructor trying to be overly professional. If you've been dancing for a while and are tired of the same old stuff, to you I recommend this video.",1250985600,,497,4.1875
3729800,5,B001OD6H5O,this dvd is a great tool for any tribal fusion dancer.... i wouldnt recomend it for the beginner dancer. (It might frustrate you) but its definately aimed more towards the dancer who is already studying tribal fusion. Zoe Jakes is an amazing dancer!!!!! and so hilarious too....,1247011200,,278,4.9361702127659575
3729801,4,B001OD6H5O,This is a very helpful dvd for intermediate and advanced tribal fusion bellydancers. In particular I love the warmup: it's really complete and full of tribal fusion bellydance moves. Every step is well explained and broken down into single movements. The choreography is nice and Zoe is really funny!,1243036800,,300,5.142857142857143
3729802,5,B001OD6H5O,"As a veteran belly dancer and instructor, it can be difficult to find instructional videos that teach me anything new or challenge me. Most videos, even from the most well-known high caliber dancers, tend to be geared toward beginners and mid level students with very little aimed at professional dancers or advanced students. Zoe Jakes' video is exactly what I have been waiting for.

A dislaimer should be made that this video is not an introductory video nor is it for aspring dancers who don't prescribe to the philosophy that progression in dance of any type is and should be WORK (or, at the very least, a work OUT). I think that even most seasoned dancers will find this video delightfully challenging. As others have mentioned, Zoe does not break down the moves with very much detailed explaination - but this should not be TOO much of a big deal for dancers who are ready for Zoe Jakes' style. For those who are not able to identify most of the belly dance movement vocabulary by sight, I'd recomend starting with more basic (and explainatory) videos and (ESPECIALLY) classes and gaining a decent ammount of familarity with the vocabulary of movement before moving on to Jakes.

As far as her warm up, if you've been dancing for a while, do yoga-based warm ups before your practice, or have been using other Tribal Fusion or Yoga for Belly dancers videos to practice and drill, then her warm ups will be appropriate for your level. If, however, you are not used to more intense yoga-based warm ups or are only used to basic stretching, then the warm up itself will be something you will likely need to work up to. I think, however, that with modification someone who wasn't used to it could still use it.

All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this video - more so than I have been with any other purchase that I have made the past few years. I highly recommend it.",1242950400,5,1878,4.583333333333333
3729803,2,B001OD6H5O,"Be very aware that this is not an instructional dvd. Zoe does breakdown some moves but you would have to be very advanced in tribal fusion and physically fit to perform her moves. Forget learning any basic drumming skills.
I love to watch Zoe dance and I enjoy Isamm charming personally. They are both incredibly talented to say the least. So if you just want to watch a performance that you may have missed during their latest tour this is the dvd you would enjoy. I saw them both in March '09 and Zoe did the best solo performance. She was spectacular!!!!",1241913600,15,557,4.470588235294118
3729804,5,B001OD6H5O,"The reason that Zoe Jakes is my favorite dancer is because she is a true original. So many dancers tend to emulate la Rachel...and beautifully so, not knocking them. But NOBODY dances as Zoe does. It's as if she closes off the world and listens only to her own quirky body.

I do have a couple of reservations about this DVD, but they are trivial and will be discussed at the end of the review. Honestly, as far as a blow-by-blow of what the video is about, I would say that the previous viewers have a pretty good handle on it, so I'll only be adding a few items of praise:

1) Zoe speaks to the camera.
Am I the only one who hates voice-overs? I've bought otherwise great DVDs with terrific instruction that have left me completely cold because the moves are accompanied with this strange, disembodied voice. Also, the lack of ""eye contact"" (i.e. facing the camera directly) is a bit dispiriting for me. I live in a small town with limited opportunities for workshops, so I really enjoy the DVDs like Zoe's (and Ariellah's, who is also very personable...certainly one of my favorites) as, very often, they are the only ""workshops"" I have.

2)While it is challenging, I love Zoe's warm-up. Sorry, but sometimes I find ""downward facing dog"" for the 40th time a bit tedious. I really like that she has offered a few exceptions to either incorporate with the usual yoga or circumvent it entirely.

3)Zoe's very personable manner and even traces of her trademark goofiness. I love that there are a couple of places in which she realizes that she has forgotten something and--rather than edit it out--simply corrects herself with a mischievous smile.

Big Zoe fan here. HUGE. That's why I hate to get to the critique part. I could not bring myself to give her a mere 4 star rating, but I do wish I could have given a 4.5...for one reason and one reason only--this is NOT a DVD for beginners--either in dance or rhythm...and it should be marketed as such: intermediate/advanced.

True, I'm still a baby dancer and maybe this is just reflecting my own bias, but I nearly wore out my ""rewind"" button the first time I attempted to go along. Moves are taught in a long, long almost unbroken string--which struck me as strange, because moves are very neatly broken down in her actual workshops...time constraint, I suppose.

I still would've bought the DVD, but I would have bought it as a means for aspiration, not immediate use. I'm afraid that other beginners might become frustrated. On the other hand, I'm sure that there are many advanced dancers who are likewise frustrated with the lack of local workshops and who appreciate the quicker pace...which is great. Just give us a clue, doll? ;)

Having said that, love the DVD, still learned a boatload about the Zoe style (well, sorta...;) and I know that I'll make this DVD a regualr part of my ""home"" workshops. Great buy...just understand that it ain't easy!",1239667200,3,2905,4.649122807017544
3729805,4,B001OD6H5O,This is a new approach to a drum solo. it is not a basic moves dvd nor a drills and memory dvd. This is not a lot of steps combined to equal one dance routine. It is intented to give you some new ideas from the traditional way to doing a drum solo. it is several individual combinations done to different drum beats. She decribe the beats to help you understand what to listen for.  It requires you to be a good listener and a good observationist because the way she explains the moves you don't get a chance to practice them a little at a time. She does not repeat the moves a lot either you will have to replay each part over if you did not get it. If you are looking for something different this will give you that. You would use this when you have learned the bascis and ready to start developing your own style and just practicing how to combine the moves to make a beautiful and unigue performance. I decided to keep it to learn some good travel and layering moves. Tribual of course is different.,1239408000,8,1003,4.196891191709844
3729806,5,B001OD6H5O,"I highly recommend this DVD to any bellydancer, whether Tribal or not.  Zoe does an amazing choreography that you can really learn from.  And Isamm's technical breakdown of the various beats is MUST KNOW info for every dancer in any style.

Obviously, this instruction is not meant for beginners - I believe Zoe makes the assumption that you'll know what she's talking about when naming certain moves and doesn't feel the need to break everything down, piece by piece, which was just fine with me.

Zoe and Isamm's performances were a joy to watch.  Both of these stars LOVE what they do and it shows on stage!  Worth the $$$ at thrice this price - GO FOR IT!",1239235200,5,659,4.5423728813559325

She runs through the sections once or twice and then you are on your own--she doesn't even add them on to the previous sections.  My favorite part of this DVD was Issam describing the different rhythms and playing a couple samples--I took notes!--but even that required rewinding several times to get my ""dooms"" from my ""teks"".
