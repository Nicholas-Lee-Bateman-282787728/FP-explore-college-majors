This is effectively a PBS retrospective of the Lawrence Welk show, with endless interviews with former cast members interspersed with snippets of songs.  My grandfather was bored to tears by it.  He enjoyed the hour of ""bonus material"" that was only a very few interviews, and mostly complete songs from the show.  The sound and video quality is good (unlike what I've heard about other Welk DVDs), but if you're looking to watch a DVD of the Lawrence Welk show, this isn't it.",1356825600,35,556,4.701030927835052
