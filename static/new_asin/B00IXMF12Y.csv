8646037,5,B00IXMF12Y,Terrific Film Noir Type Classic Movie With Cleo Moore and Hugo Haas. I couldn't find this one anywhere else and really like to see him and her work together. If you like this genre of film you will be delighted with this :),1482883200,2,223,4.209302325581396
8646038,4,B00IXMF12Y,"Another dame taking a man down the tubes with her.  It isn't the best in the world, but it works.  John Agar was in a lot of 50's monster flicks.  It also has good actor, Cedric Hardwicke (The Ten Commandments (1956)).",1453593600,3,218,4.2682926829268295
8646039,1,B00IXMF12Y,The DVD box art based on the original poster make it look like this might be a nice little 1950's film noir! Nothing could be further from the truth! Ham actor/producer/director Hugo Haas could sometimes pull one of these things off but he missed the mark big time this time! Boring beyond belief! I'd rather go in for another teeth cleaning than see this turkey again!,1411430400,7,369,4.606060606060606
