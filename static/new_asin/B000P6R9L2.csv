8189624,2,B000P6R9L2,"Ok, first let me say that I am both a very big NASCAR fan, as well as, an avid watcher of ESPN. That being said I was very disappointed in this dvd. When looking at the dvd case, I expected ""100 defining moments"" to be chock full of great highlights and exciting facts about NASCAR. I also expected some stories and a little detail. You get very little of any of that here.

First problem. The dvd is ""rapid fire"". It goes from ""defining moment"" to ""defining moment"" counting down from 100 to 1. Each moment MIGHT get 15 seconds. It's like they are counting backward with a short time limit. Now before you say that they did have a time limit for TV, let me say that if you are going to make a program like this, then do it in two or three parts for TV and release it all together for dvd. The highlights are very brief and no detail is given regarding what you are seeing at all. Just basics and then move on...snap...snap...snap.....

Second problem....this huge ""defining moments"" border that is around the screen and the highlights for the whole video. It cuts out big sections of the video and adds absolutely nothing to the experience.

I watched this with my father in law, another big NASCAR fan and he asked me, ""You actually paid for that ??"".

All in all, the info is nice to know, what there is of it. There is no detail and not nearly enough pictures and video. Even moment #1 - The Death of Dale Earnhardt gets about 5 pictures, a minute of video and then roll credits....no epilogue or anything......

If you find this cheap...$5 bucks or so....it's ok to watch once. But don't buy this for any replay value or to learn anything you don't already know. I honestly could have chopped this video together myself with my PC with a few clips and graphics.",1199923200,2,1766,4.371951219512195
