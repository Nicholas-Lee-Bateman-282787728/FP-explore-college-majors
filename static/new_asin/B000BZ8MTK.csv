8094681,3,B000BZ8MTK,"The moves in this video are extremely basic - which is great for my 3 year old.  But some entire songs have one move and that's it!  If you want variety, or have a kid who is coordinated and picks up on moves quickly, this is not the video for you.",1516060800,,248,3.843137254901961
8094682,5,B000BZ8MTK,i would like to know what dances are on this dvd.  I already have the All-Time Favorite and want to know if this is a repeat or all new dances.  Anyone?,1396569600,,152,3.870967741935484
8094683,5,B000BZ8MTK,"We've been using this DVD for 5 years now - all 3 kids love it - grownups will think it is cheesey, low-tech but kids have fun dancing to it and learning all the silly move.",1319241600,,173,3.8333333333333335
8094684,4,B000BZ8MTK,"good but some of the dance steps don't look like dancing, they aren't smooth and looks more like exercise...",1281398400,,108,4.7368421052631575
8094685,5,B000BZ8MTK,"Dance Party DVD is a great dvd for children, ages 4+.  Our five year old child loves it and has learned many of the dances. Actually, our two year old dances along and has learned the Macarana!  Infact, our whole family loves it . . . Grandma too! Good exercise. The kids play the dvd during playdates and everyone joins in! It's a lot of fun! Yes, children demonstrate the dances in the dvd, but that's part of the appeal for the young audience. Easy, upbeat, and fun!",1240790400,3,469,4.318181818181818
8094686,1,B000BZ8MTK,This is a horrible dvd.  It looks like a home video.  It is just a bunch of kids dancing cheesy scripted steps.  there is no narration.  The dance descriptions are just the same kids dancing with text underneath.  I'm glad we borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it.,1209686400,,273,4.38
8094687,1,B000BZ8MTK,This was just too cheesy.  I am sorry I bought it.,1162857600,,50,3.5454545454545454
