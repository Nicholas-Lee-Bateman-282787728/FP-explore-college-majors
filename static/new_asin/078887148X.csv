78116,5,078887148X,"Bring your many expectations of Disney Princess movies and watch as they are all wickedly turned on their heads.  This deconstruction of the Disney Animated Princess genre is gloriously painful and excruciatingly delightful.  You will experience pain watching this over-the-top yet necessary cheese-fest, but you will find it impossible to tear your eyes from the screen.  The film asks some good questions and delivers on the laughs.  Five stars.  It's a keeper.  When can I order it on DVD?",1195689600,,492,5.1645569620253164
78117,5,078887148X,"Disney finally gets one right!

Back in the heyday of Disney Animation and again in its re-birth, the Disney pictures team knew what was important-a good story and a happy ending!  We all want it, and while flashy production is nice, it can't carry a film as they have since found out.

So we start with the VILLIAN who doesn't want her step-son to marry.  An interesting twist on an otherwise cookie cutter villian.  She keeps him busy hunting trolls, until he hears ""a voice"", ala Little Mermaid (and just for those Disneyphiles, keep a lookout for Jodi Benson-the voice of Ariel and Paige O'Hara-the voice of Belle).  Giselle, a cookie cutter princess literally falls into his lap and they are off to get married!

When the stepmother dressed as an old hag, (Snow White) sends Giselle to reality, things really start to get interesting. She meets Robert, a New York divorce attorney who has had enough of fairy tales and his daughter Morgan. Here is where the film starts to have fun and laugh at itself with in joke after in joke taken from every Disney movie you can think of.  I was halfway expecting someone to go surfing through the treetops as in Tarzan.

The movie stutters a bit when Giselle actually starts to develop emotions but you know things are getting interesting when Prince Edward finally meets up with Giselle and Robert and joins the triangle. But suddenly Giselle is more human than animated.  She is actually thinking.

You have the ballroom waltz from Beauty and the Beast with Robert actually wearing close to the same blue coat.  And yes, the Prince actually gets the girl with happy endings all around.

There is something for everyone in this film from girly princess stuff, to Romance, to great special effects.  Overall, a great time for the whole family!  I can't wait to see it again!",1195689600,5,1818,4.690851735015773
78118,4,078887148X,"In the animated land of Andalasia, Giselle (Amy Adams) has met the man of his dreams, Prince Edward (James Marsden). Of course, he's also the son of evil sorceress/queen Narissa (Susan Saranadon), and if they marry, she will lose her throne. So Narissa, under the guise of an old hag with special powers, pushes Giselle into the real world of New York City. Bewildered, Giselle seeks solace in the form of widower father Robert (Patrick Dempsey). But all hell breaks loose when everyone from Andalasia, including Edward, talking squirrel Pip (Jeff Bennett, Kevin Lima), Narissa, and idiotic henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) follow and exact their own plans for Giselle.

It's as the tagline reads: ""The animated world and the real world collide."" Or something like that. Whatever. The Disney company have made a return to 2D glory with the help of Kevin Lima (""Tarzan""), who also directs the live-action scenes as well. It's a chick flick, but it's also one that guys can also embrace without feeling like they're crawling out of their skin. At least, as soon as Lima switches perspectives from Andalasia to the Big Apple.

I was a little skeptical at the start. Lima swallows one too many cotton candy sticks and shoves the girly-girly animated world down our throats. There are some cute comedic bits (involving pro voice actor Jeff Bennett as the comic relief squirrel), but it sort of skeeves my skins that it feels more overwhelming that tongue-in-cheek. Once the real world settings and the fish-out-of-water elements kick in, Lima scores hard and delivers the laughs it needs (that even includes bathroom humor, aside from a urination bit that doesn't seem to lead anywhere).

Of course, being it a Disney film, there are plenty of musical numbers. The most notable one is ""That's How You Know"" set in New York where damn near every citizen partakes in a not-too-shabbily-choreographed showstopper. Thankfully, the ""I've Been Dreaming"" number is managed to play for some good-natured laughs, especially when Prince Edward gets mauled by oncoming bicyclists in Central Park.

And then there's Amy Adams. Coming off her award-nominated performance in Junebug a few years back, it may seem odd for her to partake in a broadly-pitched project like this. But like Nikki Blonsky, the only in a few delightful performers in this summer's way-overrated ""Hairspray"" (I couldn't even pinpoint what was so good about that movie; my skin crawled mostly when Brittany Snow or Zac Efron appeared), Adams sells the material with winning charm and knowledge of Disney princesses. Picture Anna Faris' Cindy Campbell from ""Scary Movie"" in a Disney movie.

She even plays off well against perfectly-cast foil Patrick Dempsey (another good actor from the overrated ""Grey's Anatomy"") and a surprisingly comedic James Marsden. There's even a good performance from Susan Sarandon as the evil queen (this easily makes up for this September's ""Mr. Woodcock"") and Timothy Spall as the idiotic henchman. But this is Adams' movie, and I'm sure alot of people will be hardpressed not to fall in love with her.

The film sort of takes a blow when it ends in a typical romantic comedy fashion. Despite a cute bit during the animated portion (a cell phone in the animated world?), Lima throws in a corny Carrie Underwood hit, just to please the teenage girls, which it almost tried to veer away from. Look, not every happy ending has to be perfect, but with the Shrek-like playfullness surrounding the film, you think there'd be a ballsier conclusion. But that's just me, and the rest of ""Enchanted"" didn't rub me the wrong way. And that's something other films like this should probably use.",1195689600,,3669,5.016420361247947
78119,4,078887148X,"What would happen when an animated fairy tale princess found herself in our physical world? This question is the basis of ""Enchanted,"" a Disney film addressing the fairy tale clichs so effectively that it's practically a parody. The film begins in the animated world of Andalasia with the opening of a storybook; a voiceover narration says the obligatory, ""Once upon a time ..."" before we're introduced to Giselle (voiced by Amy Adams), a peasant girl who, of course, lives in a quaint little cottage in the middle of the woods. As you might expect, she thinks of nothing but finding her one true love, going so far as to make a princely mannequin while singing brightly. To top that off, she's friendly with practically every creature inhabiting the forest, and they all pay her a visit as she sings. When she's almost eaten by a troll, the dashing Prince Edward (voiced by James Marsden) rescues her, and the two immediately decide to get married.

But Edward's evil stepmother--Queen Narissa (voiced by Susan Sarandon)--refuses to give up the throne and vows to stop the wedding. Disguised as an old hag, she lures Giselle to a magical well and pushes her in. The well is actually a kind of inter-dimensional portal between Andalasia and our world, and according to Narissa, it's a place, ""where there are no happily ever afters."" Giselle emerges from a manhole in the middle of New York City. Amidst the confusing, frightening hustle and bustle of everyday living--in which people are rude, conniving, and fast-paced--a now-live action Giselle bumps into divorce attorney Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) and his six-year-old daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey). They take her in, although Robert is more than a little anxious about the situation; from his point of view, a delusional woman in a fluffy white princess dress is roaming the streets of Manhattan. Morgan, on the other hand, is thrilled, believing that a real princess has entered her life.

As she prances around with all the grace and joy of the perpetually perky, Giselle gradually learns a few important things: (1) people in the real world don't break out into song for no apparent reason; (2) people don't like it when their curtains are used to make a dress; (3) it isn't appropriate to call forth birds, rats, and roaches to help tidy up; and (4) love is not as simple as meeting one day and marrying the next. Or is it? She and Robert share interesting conversations on the nature of relationships, his stance being that they're incredibly complicated, her stance being that they don't have to be. Considering his failed marriage and his new relationship with a woman named Nancy (Idina Menzel), it's easy to see where he's coming from. Real life is nowhere near as simple as life in Andalasia, a place where Giselle is allowed to be nave and trusting.

As far as Prince Edward is concerned, he follows Giselle into Manhattan and begins his heroic search. He's just as nave about our world--he mistakes a television for a magic mirror and a bus is a foul metal beast, and he believes he can unsheathe his sword at will. He also speaks in typical Prince Charming lingo, his words boastful and one-tracked. And much like Giselle, he, too, will break into song for no apparent reason. He's accompanied by a Pip, a chipmunk who has lost his Andalasian ability to speak English. Pip constantly tries to warn Edward about Nathaniel (Timothy Spall), Queen Narissa's sniveling weasel of a henchman. Under the guise of being helpful, he does whatever he can to steer Edward in the wrong direction, and most of the time, he succeeds. Will Edward find Giselle? Will they share True Love's Kiss and live happily ever after? Or is her relationship with Robert is more complex than she would like it to be?

As you can probably tell, this film has fun toying with the classic formula of the Disney fairy tale, the most prominent being ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" So many of its plot devices are spoofed in ""Enchanted,"" from the love struck young maiden to the wicked queen to the brave prince. Yes, even the poisoned apple is reused, and I think it's obvious which characters are involved in that regard. But there are other elements of parody at work here, not the least of which is music composed by Alan Menken. Menken is known for scoring a number of Disney's films during its late twentieth century renaissance: ""The Little Mermaid""; ""Beauty and the Beast""; ""Aladdin""; ""Pocahontas""; ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""; ""Hercules."" Given this track record, I can't think of anyone better suited for the job.

And then there's the final fifteen minutes, which features an impressive computer-animated dragon; a story like this always ends with a climactic fight between the hero and the enemy, and the hero is always supposed to rescue the enemy's captive. But just who is the hero in ""Enchanted""? Who is the enemy's captive? The answers aren't all that surprising, but they still make for something entertaining. That's pretty much the way the entire film works--""Enchanted"" is a film that's perfectly aware of what it wants to accomplish, and it pokes fun at itself while simultaneously paying homage to the formulas Disney films have followed. Thank goodness it has a sense of humor; this kind of storytelling could only work for so long before starting to get silly.",1195603200,82,5332,4.848518111964874
78120,3,078887148X,"In the Kingdom of Andalasia, an evil Queen reigned.  Queen Nerissa did everything she could to keep her stepson Prince Edward from finding the woman of his dreams so she could remain Queen forever. For the most part, she was successful getting him to troll hunt.

Giselle also dwelt in Andalasia in an enchanted bower in a tree with her animal friends to serve her.  She sang, sewed, and dreamed creating an image of her ideal man--the one who would come and give her the Kiss of True Love.

One day, Prince Edward heard Giselle's song and lo--they began to sing together.  He gathered up Giselle and brought her to the castle where they would marry that very day.

As Giselle is making the final wedding preparations, an old hag comes to her and offers her a wedding day wish in a magical well.  Giselle reluctantly accepts and as she makes her wish to live happily ever after, the hag (Queen Nerissa) pushes her down into the seemingly bottomless well.

Nerissa comments as Giselle is falling screaming into the abyss that she's sending her someplace where there is no happily ever after.  That place turns out to be New York City.

Yes, our fair Giselle comes out of a manhole in the middle of New York City traffic.  Fortunately, she does meet some kind people who help her--and she does find her Prince.  While this isn't exactly a Fractured Fairy Tale, ""Enchanted"" is a delightful film for fairy tale lovers of all ages.  My favorite character of the whole cast is the chipmunk.",1195603200,13,1484,4.596958174904943
78121,3,078887148X,"I was able to see an advance screening today, and as someone who loves films but wouldn't necessarily see this I must say I enjoyed it and would whole-heartedly recommend this for children and adults.
The story opens within the classic Disney animation fairy tale world, and is able to be formulaic and witty and smoothly sets up the bulk of the film's plot in present day New York City. While the story is not particularly original the character of Giselle is beautifully played by Amy Adams, who makes up for any deficiencies in the tale. Her performance is energetic, charming, bubbling with wonderment and moments of discovery, as well as being full of heart. I only wish she could have had a longer scene or scenes with Susan Sarandon (the evil Queen Narissa), who's spite and narcissism easily counter Adams' heartful Giselle. Patrick Dempsey has the least showy part, and holds down the single father/modern man role well enough. Though James Marsden and Timothy Spall provide comic relief as Price Edward and Narissa's servant Nathaniel, respectively, they also excel within characters whose presence in the modern world fuels their evolution.
Enchanted's greatest quality is this post-modern review not of the standard, classic Disney tale, but of the characters. That fairy tale characters can be allowed to grow in a (more) realistic setting is interesting to see.
A charming film with some great acting.",1195603200,2,1415,5.051282051282051
78122,3,078887148X,"A bewitching idea that starts with gallant success, Disney's newest movie ""Enchanted"" is a blend of traditional animation and live action that is sure to delight the younger audiences. The initial setup is so fantastically silly that the crabbiest of folks are bound to melt under the numbing gaze of Amy Adams naively flirty eyes and the reality-infused fairyland events and their concomitantly humorous circumstances. But the love triangle, the focus on separation of reality and fantasy, and a fearsome dragon are predicaments that the film's reality aspects struggle to smoothly resolve, especially when fantasy was needed to instigate them in the first place.

The evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) becomes fearful of losing her kingdom of Andalasia to her stepson Prince Edward (James Marsden), should he ever find true love. When Edward suddenly announces his wedding with newfound beauty Giselle (Amy Adams), the wrathful sorceress throws her into a wishing well that transports her to present-day Manhattan. Completely contrary to the carefree, song-and-dance lifestyle of her colorful, happy home, Giselle is greeted with skepticism and unkind faces in New York as she desperately tries to seek help returning to her castle. Prince Edward learns of her disappearance, and jumps down the wishing well himself, aided by footservant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall), to rescue his true love. Giselle meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey), the only one who is amicable enough to help her, but he quickly finds that her cartoon-fantasy lifestyle is destroying the stability of his big-city life. When Narissa discovers that Giselle is dangerously close to rescue, she visits New York herself to ensure that she'll never return to the magical kingdom of Andalasia.

The first half of Enchanted is exactly that - enchanting. Amy Adams wide-eyed innocent princess is dumped into the real world of New York where she is subjected to the harshness of reality. Basically, reality sucks. What's so enjoyable is the hilarious naivety she exudes when dealing with people not of the cartoon world. Upon her meeting with Robert, she seeks a grassy meadow or a hollow tree to sleep in, she continually breaks out into fully choreographed songs and dance, and she summons the help of real-life rodents to help her do household cleaning - including rats, flies and cockroaches instead of cute little mice, birds and fawns. Adams is a constant delight to watch and Enchanted wouldn't have amounted to much without her. Similarly, Edwards entertainingly fights hulking metal dragons (city buses) and masters the use of a magic mirror (a TV set) in his quest to save Giselle.

The second half of the film falls short due to the many conflicts that arise from mixing reality and fantasy when they are so clashed by live-action and animation. The introduction of many of the characters is as cartoons in a traditionally animated world and when thrust into the live-action New York, the script is unable to satisfactorily remove them. To further complicate matters, the love triangle between Giselle, Edward and Robert halts much of the later fantasy and comedy elements, and when the dragon finally appears, it's evident that the younger audiences will be the only ones still wrapped up in all of the silliness. Ultimately, charm is eventually sacrificed for absurdity.

Susan Sarandon's performance as the evil queen Narissa is the most over-the-top character, even painfully noticeable in a film that is clearly challenging plausibility. A poison apple plot makes an appearance, as does countless references to the most popular Disney animated features. Nathaniel's supporting character is appropriate, although particularly generic, and the computer-animated chipmunk serves as little more than comic relief - although the audience is mainly forced to pity him.

Director Kevin Lima manages to squeeze in a shopping spree and a showy King's Ball, but as the end draws near, ""the place where there are no happily ever afters"" is destined for a predictably happy ending. While we wouldn't have wanted it to end in any other way, returning things to the way they were is utterly impossible, and the epilogue-styled afterwards is a bit too neat and tidy and unreasonably resolute. The film is a lot of fun for the audience it was intended for, and as a side effect, quite entertaining for adults, provided you can ignore the ridiculousness of the last half-hour.

The seamless mix of animation and real life so clever. I mean how can you not root for Pip the chipmunk? Stand out performances by James Marsden and Timothy Spall. Amy Adams is phenomenal and perfectly cast. I enthusiastically recommend and even though it is even better watching with my granddaughter...not really necessary.",1505520000,,1017,4.784090909090909

78270,5,078887148X,"Pros: The best Disney film since The Little Mermaid

Cons: The animated characters weren't startled enough by the ""real world"".

The Plot

I think the plot is pretty much laid out in the trailers. This film is about a beautiful animated redhead named Giselle who longed for love from a handsome Prince. She lived in a wonderful cottage in the woods of Andalasia, and her only friends were the wildlife that came to visit her each day. She had one best friend named Pip, who happened to be a wisecracking chipmunk. This may be a Disney cliche, but that was the point.

Then there's Prince Edward, who in this wonderful animated dimension, was busy capturing ten trolls a month. When we meet Prince Edward he also started to feel the ""draw"" of domestic life. He and Giselle found each other through song of course and they vowed to get married that day. Prince Edward's stepmother, Queen Narissa has other plans for this wedding day. The queen's fear is that a Princess Giselle will take her crown. The Queen is endowed with powerful magic and with a disguise as a nice old lady; she tricks her into making a wish at the fountain on her wedding day. When Giselle leans over to wish, Narissa pushes her in, and she falls down a hole in a similar Alice in Wonderland fashion, and ends up in a sewer underneath New York City.

Giselle emerges from the manhole in her tremendous wedding gown, and is subtly startled by the look of a world that is not animated. She asks the people for help to direct her back to Andalasia so that she can marry her Prince Edward. She ends up alone in NYC, she gets mugged by a homeless man for her tiara, and now it's raining. She is spotted from a cab by the daughter of a divorce lawyer named Robert. His six year-old daughter Morgan convinces him to help the damsel in distress. He brings her home so that she could dry off and use the phone, but she falls asleep on his couch and he is now stuck with her for the night. Giselle ends up spending more than just a night with Robert and Morgan, and when he decides to trust that she is not some mental nut, he begins to like her company. Giselle also loves to be with Robert and Morgan.

Just because Giselle is in this new world, she is not without her animated powers. She can still summon wildlife with a song to help her with chores (although, in NYC this consists of rats, pigeons, cockroaches and other insects). When she sings, others magically know her song and sing along with her, much to the amazement of Robert. Prince Edward now emerges from the manhole and he begins his quest to find his bride to be. Also, in NYC is Nathanial, he does the Queen's evil bidding in hopes of her affection. It's Nathaniel's job to keep the two apart and also to feed Giselle one of her poison apples.

So what will happen in the end? Will the two finally get together? Is there something in the air for Giselle and Robert? Will the evil Queen be victorious? Only you can make these predictable outcomes, or better yet - just watch the film.

My Thoughts

Im not sure if you know this about me yet, but I am freakishly into Disney. I started late in life with my fascination with all things Disney, but I think that I have caught up with some of the nuttiest fanatics. One of the real pleasures of Enchanted is spotting the many allusions to Disney Classics of the past. Enchanted is really not much more than a fabulous veneration to the most beloved animated films from Disney.

The character of Giselle is portrayed by the beautiful Amy Adams (Talladega Nights, Underdog). Even while she was in the real world, she maintained an animated feel through her mannerisms (i.e. - her pinky fingers were usually extended) and her exaggerated sing-song like voice. Her facial expression, when not smiling or laughing, always gave the impression of naivety. Amy Adams' effortless beauty is a joy to behold.

Patrick Dempsy (Grey's Anatomy, Sweet Home Alabama) plays divorce lawyer Robert, a victim of circumstance who ended up involved in the life of Giselle. Of course he doesn't even entertain the thought that Giselle is originally from a different dimension where the world is animated. Yet when she breaks into song, summons animals to clean his apartment or creates a new dress every morning at his house by cutting up his drapes - his reaction is very funny and entertaining. As the two come to know each other even more, you as the viewer begin to hope that these two end up together in the end.

A nice surprise for me was that Idina Menzel (Ask the Dust, Rent) was in the cast. She played Nancy, Robert's love interest. I loved her in Rent as Maureen, and she was good here, but I was disappointed that she didn't sing any numbers because she has such an incredible voice. Despite her very attractive appearance and her nice enough disposition - Robert didn't seem too into her, and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) did not connect with her either. Morgan's mother left the family when Morgan was very young, and at first I assumed it was because she died, but later it seems that she just left. They never explained it unfortunately; I thought it would have given Robert and Morgan a bit more depth.

Susan Sarandon was cast as Queen Narissa, and it was kind of a small part, especially for her short time on screen when she appeared in the real world unanimated. But having said that, her portrayal of the wicked queen was spot on. They didn't explain how or why the queen knew of this other dimension, but in the end I suppose it didn't really matter. Speaking of the other dimension, where the world is 3D and less colorful, I was a little let down that the characters from Andalasia weren't more taken with this brand new experience that they beheld. I feel that this one aspect cheapens the film a bit, and it would have been something that would have only taken a few seconds to show.

The best part of the movie for me was probably the biggest scene in the film. It was a musical number called That's How You Know, and a huge cast of extras along with the cast were involved in it. It was very funny and entertaining at once. The song was written by Disney alumni Alan Menken, who had worked on almost everything from The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and on - and Stephen Schwartz (Godspell, Pocahontas). All of the musical numbers in the film were instant Disney classics and they made the film that much more enjoyable.

I thought that the extras were entertaining, the ones that I had played with anyway. I love that the video for Carrie Underwoods song Ever, Ever After was included. Also there is a feature called The D-Files which is pretty much viewing the movie with some trivia questions and answers along the way about how every scene relates to older Disney classic movies. Its a great idea because its most likely that you will be having this discussion anyway, so here is the authority answering all the questions and pointing out the ones that you may have missed.

Enchanted is a wonderful Disney film, with great music and humorous scenes. I would recommend viewing this in the Blu-Ray format, as it will likely be a showcase disc for your home theater set up.",1500940800,,7158,4.511574074074074

A fairy tale comes to life in this thoroughly original, new Disney Classic. And the sights and sounds are even more stunning on this Disney Blu-ray.

Drawing inspiration from its classic heritage, Disney creates an inspired story unlike any you have experienced before. Filled with excitement, fun and spectacular music from the legend Alan Menken, ENCHANTED is the ultimate fish-out-of-water adventure. For princess-to-be Giselle, life is a fairy tale  until she is banished from the animated land of Andalasia and thrust into the very unmagical, live-action world of modern-day Manhattan. When a cynical, no-nonsense divorce lawyer comes to her aid, little does he realise this joyful, wide-eyed innocent is about to enchant him and can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?  ENCHANTED the musical comedy that casts a more entrancing and dazzling spell in Blu-ray High Definition.  Narrated by Dame Julie Andrews.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: ENCHANTED [2007] tells the story of the soon-to-be-princess Giselle, who is tricked into falling through a portal to our world. Landing in New York City, Giselle befriends a lawyer named Robert as she waits for her true love Prince Edward to find her and take her back to her home in Andalasia. Giselle must come to terms with the customs and traditions of our world and discover what love is really all about, all while evading the evil schemes of Prince Edwards mother, Queen Narissa.

ENCHANTED is essentially a spoof of the Disney canon, but also pays homage to the various movies it takes its inspiration from. This could have gone one of two ways.  Either its really entertaining and funny or it could have been awful and completely offend us fans by taking the parody side of things way too far. Thankfully, the movie is very tasteful in how it pokes fun at the classic Disney animated movies and succeeds in being very entertaining and full of humour. It takes a lot of the clichs that we see in many of the classic animated films and puts them into the real world, using this to show how silly and unpractical a lot of them are. The majority of the humour in the movie comes from both this and the other characters reacting to these things happening around them.

ENCHANTED starts off as a traditional, hand-drawn animated feature before becoming live-action when the characters enter our world. The animation is fantastic and uses a slightly different visual style than is usually found in a Disney film. The characters are more realistic looking than usual so that they are more recognisable when we see them as their live-action counterparts but still cartoony enough to make them appealing to the audience. Despite this, the film manages to capture the very essence of a Disney feel in the animation department.

ENCHANTED comes with wonderful music from the incredibly talented duo of Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.  The two of whom worked together on animation films such as Pocahontas which I hate and detest and far superior and brilliant The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The songs blend with the tone of the movie and are very funny within themselves. Especially Happy Working Song which jokes around with the fact that in a lot of classic Disney films there are songs sang whilst characters are doing rather unpleasant jobs or chores, which is of course the typical essence of a Disney film.

ENCHANTED is packed full of cameos and Disney references. At numerous points during the film classic Disney music can be heard playing in the background, often when actors from those respective films are on screen. Some of those actors who make an appearance in the movie are: Jodi Benson [voice of Ariel], Judy Kuhn [singing voice of Pocahontas], Paige OHara [voice of Belle] and Dame Julie Andrews [Mary Poppins]. Youll definitely want to watch this beautiful film numerous times and see if you can find all the little nods references to other Disney films!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings you this stunning 1080p encoded image. The opening animated sequence is window boxed with a black frame on all four sides to achieve a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and when we transition to the real world, the bars on the sides disappear for a full 2.35:1. The exaggerated palette of the animation gives way to a fairly accurate representation of the harsh urban jungle, which is eventually infiltrated by the rainbow hues of the big production number ""That's How You Know"" against a variety of lush greens in Central Park and the Blacks are strong and the overall image is noise-free throughout the film. Moving on to the action that takes place in our world, we are, as expected, treated to a lush, clear, and finely detailed image that excels on Blu-ray. The print, of course, is flawless, clean as a whistle, and masterfully rendered in this stunning 1080p image quality. The image is virtually free of film grain as well. Black levels are consistently excellent, reproducing an inky, exquisite look and feel that adds depth and realism to the proceedings. Fine detail is in abundance, perhaps best noticed in Prince Edward's outfit. Overall, this is a stunning image with fantastic colours, terrific depth, and high detail. It's another top-notch effort from the Disney organisation. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment presents us with a totally awesome 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio experience, which would make it a Disney's first. The audio format is a very warm, very appealing soundtrack that is sure to please Disney fans and matches the fine image frame-for-frame that is totally spellbinding. The audio fidelity is superb, as should be expected with this brand new audio sound mix. The rear soundstage is pleasantly used, surrounding the viewer in a soothing state of bliss as an animated world comes to life, engulfing the senses, especially the auditory, with fine reproduction of every note sung by a human, chirped by a bird, or played by an instrument. Bass is deep and strong, notably in an early scene involving an oversized troll. Even the little things, like heavy rain drops hitting the outside of a car while we are inside of it, sound real and engaging, surrounding us and making us feel everything but wet, as if we're right there in the car. Dialogue reproduction is uniformly excellent. It's never drowned or lost under music or effects, and sounds natural and clean. This is an active, near reference and completely enjoyable listening experience, and the sound designers of this film are to be applauded as we're seamlessly sucked into a world we know but are made to believe, at times, that we're as lost as poor Giselle, and that's just one area that makes this film so good and so much fun. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The D-Files: Relive ENCHANTED, but this time test your knowledge and uncover all classic Disney moments hidden throughout the film. You get four categories and they are New Game; Save Game; Continue Game and Quite Game. With this interactive pop-up type trivia game challenge, viewers are then asked a series of multiple choice questions pertaining to the film ENCHANTED that relate to other Disney classic films and of course the faster you answer the questions correctly, so the better chance of you gaining more points throughout the game, especially as there is a time limit, and then more additional fascinating features are unlocked and revealed. But if you feel you do not feel going to the end of the film, you can quit the game at any time by pressing the pop up menu and save your progress, and continue at a later date. When you get to the very end of the pop-up type trivia game challenge and you gain 290 points like I did, you have a choice of three bonus categories, if you click on the first titled category you get to see a very nice special bonus. To me this was a very enjoyable fun filed interactive pop-up type trivia game challenge, especially if you go all the way to the end of the film and well worth the effort. Contributors include Kevin Lima [Director], Chris Sonnenberg [Assistant Animation Supervisor], James Baxter [Supervising Animator], Idina Menzel [Nancy], Alan Menken [Composer/Lyricist], and Stephen Schwartz [lyricist], Bill Kelly [Writer], James Brown [Character Animation Lead], Rick Baker [Hag Make-Up Effects], Susan Sarandon [Queen Narissa], Amy Adams [Giselle] and James Marsden [Prince Edward].

Special Feature: Fantasy Comes To Life [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] Go behind-the-scenes on three key sequences to see how the filmmakers created the movie magic. With each titled category you have to click on each special feature separately and they are as follows: Happy Working Song [6:26] Here we find Giselle sings as roaches, rats and pigeons clean the apartment, and here we get an inside look at how the animal trainers and special effects wizards crafted this memorable scene. Thats How You Know [5:55] Join Amy Adams and a cast of hundreds of extras in New Yorks Central Park, and experience the making of this modern musical extravaganza. Fantasy Comes to Life: A BLAST At The Ball [5:29] Learn how the filmmakers used stunts, swords, skyscrapers, Susan Sarandon and a giant dragon to create ENCHANTEDs climatic finale. Contributors include Stephen Schwartz [Lyricist], Alan Menken [Composer/Lyricist], Amy Adams [Giselle], Kevin Lima [Director], Thomas Schelesny [Special Visual Effects Supervisor], Patrick Dempsey [Robert], Gregory Perler [Film Editor], Barry Josephson [Producer], John OConnell [Choreographer], Maria Corres [Associate Choreographer], Roger Green [Rollerblader #6], Jermaine Browne [Hip Hop Dancer], Harvey Evans [Dancer], Chris Chase [Executive Producer], Susan Sarandon [Queen Narissa], George Aguilar [Stunt Coordinator] and David S. Dranitzke [Visual Effects Producer].

Special Feature: Bloopers [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:11] Here we get to view typical light-hearted collection of a series of funny outtakes straight from the cutting room floor. But to me, some of the scenes were out right total silliness.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:05] Join director Kevin Lima as he shares a selection of scenes that did not make it into the final film release and Kevin Lima offers up a brief introduction to each scene before we see it as well as additional context before each clip is revealed. Not all of the scenes are finished, especially those that are animated and it is only pencil sketches at that, but the extended opening is very cute, and there is a nice bit with Amy Adams and James Marsden realizing that they aren't really supposed to be together. We get to view six deleted scenes, which consist of the following: A Lock Of Prince Edwards hair; Leaving Karate; I Am Not Waiting For My Prince; Hotdogs On The Bridge; Nathaniel's Revelation and Exit With A Twist. As usual, you can either play them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Pips Predicament: A Pop-Up Adventure [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:37] Can one brave chipmunk save the Prince Edward and all of Andalasia from the evil Queen Narissa? The thrilling adventure unfolds in this all-new animated pop-up animated tale. It is also presented in high definition and backed by 5.1 audio. I can predict that A Pop-Up Adventure feature will totally enthral young children and adults alike. Narrated by Dame Julie Andrews.

Special Feature: Music Video: Ever, Ever After [Performed by Carrie Underwood] [2007] [480i] [1.37:1] [3:33] Here we have the Music Video for the song Ever, Ever After from the hit Disney film ENCHANTED, that was written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz to replace a duet by actors Idina Menzel and James Marsden that was meant to take place during the beginning of the film's cartoon narrative. With this Music Video ""Ever, Ever After"" we see Carrie Underwood wandering around New York and being chased by a handsome young man, who eventually catches up with Carrie Underwood.

Trailers: When you load up the Blu-ray disc, you automatically get a selection of different Trailers, which are as follows: Walt Disney Home Entertainment Blu-ray Promotion [1080p] [1.78:1]; Sleeping Beauty  Blu-ray Platinum Edition [1080p] [2.35:1]; The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.40:1] and Underdog [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.35:1] [7:47]

Finally, overall ENCHANTED is a great and romantic film. It is a totally lot of jolly fun and is equally very entertaining, plus there are of course as already mentioned loads of references for us Disney fans. The Disney film succeeds in capturing the essence of the Disney classic film and has a bit of fun with it too on the way. The story is simple and original, taking a tried-and-true formula and updating it for the new millennium, but with both grace and honour, harkening back to the typical Disney classics in a respectful manner, but also making fun of them along the way. Everything about this Blu-ray disc, especially this Disney film, the video, the sound, and the supplements is totally perfect. Each one is fascinating and exciting, and together makes for one heck of a Blu-ray package and I know most audience members will find something to love about all aspect of this magical Disney film, like I did and by the time the film ends you will be definitely humming and singing those magical songs for some time to come, as Alan Menken (composer/lyricist) and Stephen Schwartz (lyricist) have done a superb and sterling job all round. Highly Recommended!

Id recommend this more for an age group over 12 years old, because a younger child would be bored with this one because she would have had to seen some typical Disney princess movies in order to appreciate the humor in this.  It starts with the usual animated Disney setting with a handsome prince courting a lovely maiden. Then the princes wicked stepmother puts them into the REAL non-animated world (in Times Square) to deal with the misery of it. The actors were great in this. Giselle was a corny, but extremely likable character, and same for the prince. Both of them looked like a Disney prince/princess in the flesh.  It's kind of like a fantasy an older child might have if their Disney characters came to the real world to deal with it.",1481068800,,780,4.524822695035461

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

While dad thinks Ms. Princess is nuts (like any grown adult) his daughter Morgan knows for sure this is the real deal (like all girls her age I've met anyway). I love how Gieselle begins to feel things she wouldn't feel in fairy tale movies  like anger and how Robert (Morgan's dad) begins to really like her but still think she's kind of nuts. I have to admit like any romantic sap my favorite part is the dance at the romantic ball not only were all the costumes beautiful but the song ""So Close"" was also beautiful. I actually cried (but so did my fiance lol). This is a great movie for the little girl in your life who loves happy endings and the grown up who would never admit it but still hopes for the happy ending.

His comic timing was right on.  Susan Sarandan as the evil step mother and witch was really well done.  The special effects were so fun how they tied fantasy into reality.  Amy Adams was so cute and innocent.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this show.,1439424000,,583,4.162162162162162

79161,5,078887148X,"So me being a musician I get to do a few interesting gigs.  One of which was being part of the rhythm/instrument section for a university male chorale.  On one of our two-week tours, one guy kept playing and replaying Michael Bay's ""Transformers"".  Love it or hate it, the action in it is still fun...but frankly, it was getting old.  But then another guy was so tired of that robot marathon, he pulled a 180 on the movies and popped Disney's ""Enchanted"".  At first we were like, ""really?""...but by the end, our tour bus became a small piece of that Andalasian magical land (or New York as it were haha) with us singing along.  Needless to say, it gave us the energetic push to finish the tour strong.  A movie I personally had no desire or care for, since that day it stuck with me.  It was cinematic true love's kiss.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Well, honestly, there isn't anything that would be particularly be offensive.  Only two things I can think of that warrant some mentioning to parents so they know what they are getting into.  The first is when Robert accidentally walks in on Giselle finishing her shower.  Nothing is shown, though as pigeons swoop down and wrap her in a towel as he walks in.  Also, when Prince Edward finally finds the apartment complex where Giselle is residing with Robert and his daughter, he doesn't have the apartment number and has to go door to door.  In one of those comedic door-knocking short-clips, a beefy biker dude opens the door and stares seemingly amorously at him while he passes on confused.

AS TO THE FILM...(ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT SPOILERS)
Themes:
The basic premise of this film is, ""what would happen if a Disney animated Princess was hit by 'real world reality'?""  Needless to say, the results are quite magical in a real way.  This is a film that is both parody and homage to the staple ""Disney Princess Story"". The directors themselves looked back to the old Disney classics for inspiration for this.  They intentionally use cliches and break them all at the same time.  There are many wonderful themes at play in this film such us dealing with sadness, the power of communication, and others.  But all these center around what is probably the key theme: ""is there still a place for the classic fairytale in our more cynical (or at best more ""practical"") modern society?""  As Robert and Giselle interact with each other, this central question comes further and further to the forefront.  As such, this film has been said to be both a deconstruction of the fairytale by some as well as a re-wakening of the word's ""magic"" by others.  But you know, maybe that's the point.  The issue was never about one being right and the other wrong...but that both are needed.  Giselle really puts many of us ""moderns"" to shame as she reminds us that ideals aren't ideals because they are attainable, but because it is what should be...that and also that love is an active pursuit and devotion, not something comfortable and passive.  Robert on the other hand reminds us that we should not be blind but should be actively thinking and processing...we need to see things for what they are.  An interesting dynamic is that though one comes from a land of magic while the other does not, it's when they both come together that the magic of living truly comes out in the film...and that though there is misery in this world (and a lot of it), that's no reason to abandon the good.

Music:
Special mention must be made for the music...as part of the homage, they totally turned this into a Disney style musical.  And the songs are quite infectious, warm, bubbly, and simply charming.  A cool thing I learned from one of the extras was that in staging the musical numbers, they went into it as if they were doing a purely animated film.  Seriously, this is the closest you will ever get to the Disney Universe coming to life in it's complete glory.  The cinematic score was also wonderful and complimentary to the scenes actively shifting in mood as the actions progressed.  Also, they made excellent use of one of the most classic of narrative music writing...the leitmotif (otherwise known as a musical recurring theme or melody representing a character, place, and/or idea).  It plays throughout the movie and shifts in mood.

Effects:
Another note needs to be made on behalf of the effects.  One thing that makes the fantastical themes believable is that the producers relied on so many effects.  Some would say that's a bad thing, but then you would misunderstand what I mean.  You see, they blended both ""traditional"" effects and CG...there were real trained animals running around doing things leaving the CG animals only for the truly impossible.  And even the CG animals blended in seamlessly with the real world animals.  On top of this, they also relied on old school marry poppin'ish choreographic style...aka the golden age of hollywood musical dance numbers.

Actor Chemistry:
Simply put, it was good...Giselle is so naively innocent, but you begin to see her change the longer she stays in New York.  Yet even in those changes she stays Giselle.  Robert is clearly cynical...but the more he interacts with Giselle, the more he changes, but in a Robert kind of way.  Watching them interact together is a real treat.  Nathaniel, though, is the one who goes through so much as he, too, begins to grapple with love and happily ever afters.  That said, Prince Edward and Nancy, though entertaining and supporting the main characters well, were not terribly fleshed out (let alone developed).  It worked for this film, but I would have liked a little more from them.  The Queen Narrisa is flat as slab, but she definitely was supposed to be an homage to the classic Disney villain, so it works wonderfully.

Extras:
Unfortunately, there really isn't much in the way of extras (compared to the extras Disney has delivered as of late).  But what is there is still good quality and very satisfying.  The ""Fantasy Come to Life"" 3-part mini documentary is especially enlightening on the music production, choreography design, and stage effects used.  There's also the music video for ""Ever Ever After"" (this one is the musical note in the same ""sign"" as the previous mentioned extra).  Another insightful extra was the deleted scenes.  I liked the fact that they actually explained why the cut out that extra footage.  Honestly, it just deepens the story.  After seeing those scenes, some of them i would really have wanted them to keep ^_^.  In addition, there is also a blooper reel, as well as an animated pop-up-book-style story telling of what Pip did prior to Prince Edward going to New York.  That one was ok as plot hole filler...but I wouldn't have minded if they replaced it with an even more in-depth documentary.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a wonderfully simple feel good film.  But even so, it leaves you warm with hope inside and serves as a good reminder that misery is no excuse to abandon the good things in life.  Again, it may be simple, but in many ways it's simplicity is a depth all its own...and that this movie perhaps is something we really need in what can often feels like ""darker times"".",1431129600,,7136,4.711057304277643

79213,5,078887148X,"I have to admit that I only recently fell in love with this movie. The music is great and the characters are so over the top, it's hysterical. The style of this movie is exactly why I love visiting Disney World. Yes, we all know that Disney World is over the top and not the real world... but there's a little piece of me that thinks a little piece of Disney could be real. So we all go, knowing that it isn't real, but hoping that some small piece is real, and reveling in the sheer goofiness and silliness of it all and, yes, laughing at ourselves for holding out hope. This movie captures that feeling perfectly.

One little nugget from the movie:

Amy Adams: Now if only I can find a place to rest my head for the night.
Patrick Dempsy: What kind of place?
Amy Adams: I don't know. Maybe a nearby meadow or a hollow tree.
Patrick Dempsy: A hollow tree?
Amy Adams: Or a house full of dwarves. I hear they're very hospitable.

Amy Adams is spot on, as is the guy who plays Prince Edward. I highly recommend this if you are willing to just go with the spirit of the movie and laugh at yourself for humming a happy little working song.",1425945600,2,1135,4.197247706422019

Disney did what I have always wanted to see in a film.  They did a production number that just blows up in the park.  Back in 1967 I tried to explain my vision to another theatre jock, and he didn't get it.  Well, I chortled my way through this film from start to finish.  The young girl who plays the daughter is just a treat to watch.  The casting is great.  OK, OK, I like Amy Adams.",1416787200,,515,3.9705882352941178

79301,5,078887148X,"Enchanted is one movie that presented a fairy tale in a realistic manner at present in modern-day New York. It is one original and refreshing movie that still in the Disney tradition that both kids and adults will appreciate alike. It contains witty lines and great animation. Aside from that,the character of Giselle and her story will make people from all ages appreciate and relate to her. For adults it will bring out the memories of their youth into them. I attribute that to Amy Adams' excellent portrayal of Giselle. She is one hell of an actress as she is realistic as a live- action fairy. In terms of the other performances,special mention also goes to Patrick Dempsey as the lawyer and James Mardsen as the prince. Also,the music,the direction and the story also makes this film highly-recommended for everyone. In summary,everything works in all level for this movie.",1416268800,,879,4.906040268456376

79449,5,078887148X,"Simply put, this is the best Disney movie I've had the honor to watch up until now, and I've seen many of them, so this must be a serious compliment to the film and all who were involved in the making of it - director, actors, script writers, music writers and composers - everyone here teamed in order to bring us, the audience, the most original story Disney studios could come up with.
It starts, off-course, as a rather typical Disney fairy-tale - a young and beautiful peasant girl living alone (well, alone bit with loads of animals as company) in a cottage in the glen of the forest, almost being eaten by a troll and then rescued in the last minute by a handsome prince that carries her off toward the sunset in the horizon and promises her that the next day they shall be married.
But here, at that banal point, comes the twist. There is a wicked witch in the story, oh yes, how could there not be - but she turns out to be much more sophisticated then we thought her to be in the first glance. You see, she has a magic well that leads whoever is unfortunate to fall into it, to a rather different world than the colored, innocent, happy-go-lucky universe of Andalasia. She gets to the real world, or in other words, our world - the sometimes hard and harsh reality of nervous, busy, stressed everyday people that won't notice a lost and confused princess. Naturally, her distress grows until she falls on (literally) a cynical lawyer and his six-year-old daughter in the middle of Manhattan, New York, and after a series of funny incidents and all kinds of adventures (she's really is something with cleaning quickly a place or sewing her dresses from curtains and rags)... This lawyer, despite his earlier will to marry his girlfriend Nancy in a most business-like manner and without even a crumb of romance involved in it - finds himself slowly but surely falling in love with that naive and surprising girl, who seems to be happy about everything and can make a melody out of every situation. There are of-course a wicked witch (how predictable, her almost animated mother-in-law) who's trying to kill Giselle in all possible ways and that wicked witch loyal servant (typical as well, in love with the bitch). Also add the the pot a handsome but incredibly stupid prince who's looking for Giselle all over New-York and a squirrel who mimics everything after losing his ability to talk (as animals do in Disney animated features). What you get is an hilariously funny story that's not ashamed of laughing at itself and the motives that serve it (from previous movies, of-course).
In short, if I had to recommend on just one Disney movie, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend on Enchanted. Wonderful film that one never gets tired of and one of those who are meant to be watched over and over and over again.",1404864000,,2815,4.609561752988048

The blend of fairytale cartoon with a NYC reality is also a great feature of the film.

The story is written very well where Amy Adams' character and Patrick Dempsey's character make that initial awkward approach to romance that is so typical of mostly everyone in life.  Then it blossoms into something undeniable and beautiful.

79518,5,078887148X,"This film is very funny, but to me its true value can be found in its message of love.  The heroine, althought very humorous in her own right, reinforces the very human desire to be loved.  She also symbolizes the desire of humans to live happily ever after, a desire that does not get much support these days.  The prince couldn't have been funnier, the male lead could have been more animated in my opinion.  Althought he does come thru in the movies climax.  The scenes with the animals, were very Disney.  The songs were good, and for once did not take up to much of this film.  All in all a very funny film, but also a very heart warming film, for its values, well worth buying.  JRV",1399593600,,688,4.27906976744186
79519,3,078887148X,"Its fun, but honestly, it overstays its welcome and doesnt have all that much to say. Most of the clever bits come toward the beginning; by the end the movie feels overspent. The initial cynicism pretty quickly gives way to ordinary Disney triteness. It starts off with some fun fish-out-of-water stuff with the princess, pointing out how she doesnt really understand the modern world and is a complete mismatch for it, but then henchman whats-his-face come along and seems to understand it implicitly for some reason. Like, when hes talking to the evil witch in a soup pot hes trying to hide it from the other people- why? He has no way of knowing that isn't a thing in this world. It seems like the fantasy characters just understand things whenever its plot-convenient for them to do so.

This movie manages to be slightly less offensive than Kate & Leopold- a film it shares a very similar premise with- but only slightly. It still manages to come away with the backhanded message that hard-working women deserve to live in a version of the past where they don't have to do anything, while men- even gross ones- should be in the present, where they can find unlimited success! Ick. And who designed that book that the henchman writes at the end? What were they thinking? The shape is terrible! Its like a coffee table book! Whos lining up to have Peter Pettigrews ugly mug on their coffee table? That is clearly a self-help book of the sort that you're supposed to put on the bedside table and pretend to be reading because Oprah told you to. Its all wrong for that!

For all that this movie seems to be trying to flip the script- the princess is self aware but the prince is air-headed, that sort of thing- it still essentially presents the father who wants his daughter to look up to Susan B. Anthony as fundamentally wrong, and theres this weird double-standard by which Idina Menzel is presented as wrong for being too hard-working and invested in her clothing line... but then when Princess Whats-Her-Face starts a clothing line with absolutely no effort on her part, its awesome! The movie seems to want to say things about traditional Disneys warped standards of gender, but it doesnt seem to know what those things are. Its like instead of pointing and laughing, its just pointing and saying, Yup... thats a thing. With absolutely no deconstruction or criticism.

I mean, thats basically the issue with every aspect of this movie- its trying to be a parody, but it doesnt appear to understand what a parody is. Its too self-aware to be earnest and endearing on its own merits, but its too muddled and pointless to be entertaining as a meta joke.",1399420800,,2657,4.673076923076923

79545,5,078887148X,"Academy award nominations: Song-So Close, Song-Happy Working Song and Song-True Love's Kiss.

March Boy awards: Leading Actress-Amy Adams, Supporting Actress-Susan Sarandon , Original Score, Song-So Close, Cinematography and Visual Effects.

Kevin Limas Enchanted is one of those movies where there is no middle ground. You either love it or hate it. Let me give you a fair warningif you think The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins are corny, disgusting, sugary dumb fests and hate a single drop of sentimentality or syrupRUN! Dont walk! Far away from this movie!
 Enchanted is about Giselle, a fairy tale peasant girl who meets her prince charming Edward and goes off into the sunset to live happily ever after and share true loves kiss. Edwards step mother/wicked witch is jealous and fears the new girl will dethrone her so she conspires to get rid of her by sending her off to Planet Earth, America, New York City. There are some twists and turns and then the film ends. I won't spoil anymore. All Ill say is thisseeing the characters from the magical fairy tale land being confronted with aspects of the real world are extremely funny.
 Amy Adams is outstanding as Giselle. She pulls off her kooky and annoying antics extremely well and even though you can tell the real world is going to get into her blood and change her into a more mature, wiser and sensible woman it develops so slowly and gradually that it feels real. My favorite of her scenes are:

1. You are not a very nice old man!

2. When she steps out of the shower in a towel and asks the lawyer, Mr. Phillips where the water comes from. He says From the pipes. Where do the pipes go? she asks. I don't know. I guesswherever the pipes go. Oh I see. She replies with a big smile and twinkle in her eye It is magical.

3. The way she delivers the line The shower is WONDERFUL.

4. When Mr. Phillips tells her about how his wife left him and thats why he doesnt believe in the fairy tale/dreams come true mentality. She drops her silly antics and says in a soft, serious tone Im very sorry for both of you.

5. The unsure, half-hearted way she leaves Mr. Phillips and his daughters house with Prince Edward. When shes on her date with Edward shes not silly or goofy anymore. She talks in a very serious tone of voice. She agreesbut not without hesitating at firstthat after the ball, they will go back to Andalusia.

6. When she dances with Mr. Phillips at the ball to So Close. The look on her face says it all. Now she knows beyond a shadow of a doubt whom she TRULY loves. When Edward comes to escort her out of the building, as she goes up the stairs the look on her face is so desolate because she knows she doesnt love Edward anymore because it was only a fleeing fancyits an unforgettable expression.

7. When she trades back Mr. Phillips sentence at the end of the climax. Is this your habitfalling off of things?

The music is wonderfully orchestrated and all the songs are so good it would be very difficult to choose the best. My favorite though is So Close because it is so calm and soothing and at the defining moment of the moviewhen Giselle is wearing a modern dress while everyone else is in medieval attirea terrific symbol of how the real world has transformed her.

Patrick Dempsey is okay as the second lead Mr. Phillips but it is Amy Adams and the supporting members of the cast that really make the movie special. James Marsden (not technically a supporting role since its a love triangle but still) is side-achingly hilarious as the goofy, narcissistic Prince Edward, Susan Sarandon as the evil queen Narissa delivers her lines with crisp speed and wit and Timothy Spall (who looks and acts a lot like Peter Ustinov in his buffoonish roles) is really good as her dim-witted sidekick Nathaniel. Idina Menzel looks absolutely beautiful as Nancy, the lawyers fianc&eacute; and has some very good moments like her line delivery of What? So YOU can have some girl-bonding time? Also, Tonya Pinkins is BRILLIANT in her brief three scene role as Phoebe. She has some of the BEST lines in the whole movie. ""Oh you're just afraid I don't NEED you!""  YOU NEVER LOVED ME LIKE YOU LOVE HANK!!! Everybody has problems. Everybody has bad times. Do we sacrifice the good times because of the bad? No. I have no problem giving her a nomination for such a small role because she always strikes just the right chord and tone.

Five stars. Its syrup and melodrama, fabulously over the top with sugar and fizz but its GREAT sugar and fizz.",1397088000,,4506,4.545679012345679

Also features Indina Menzel although sadly she wasn't given any singing parts.  I guess with Disney movies there really is an embarrassement of riches as even most of the supporting cast was super talented (i.e. Dempsey's secretary is played by the same actress who voiced The Little Mermaid.)

If you insist on being a princess, who sees good all around you, and fights off evil where you find it, then life is a fairy tale, even when it isn't.

Amy Adams does a great job in getting you to both laugh and sympathize with her character's dilemma without going over the top ( comes close but keeps it in check for the entire film . )  James Marsden , and Patrick Delaney are also wonderfully believable as well as the rest of the cast.  This was made at a time when musicals were just coming back into mainstream so it really has to be viewed on DVD now and enjoyed in that context if you passed it up before.  A must see !  Parents should pre-view before letting pre-teens and younger watch for only a couple scenes. Overall a great movie !",1386806400,2,825,4.150943396226415

Any lesser heroine would surely be defeated such villainous circumstances. But Princess Giselle (Adams) won't let anything stop her.

Cartoon meets real life (movie version of real life) and comedy is the result. I laughed most of the way through this movie, only slowing down towards the end where the movie needed to wrap up the story. It is after all a Disney movie. Evil must be defeated and true love must win out.

79636,5,078887148X,"Sorry if I spoiled the plot or ending for you with my title there, but come on...this is a Disney film marketed towards families (I think...)  Anyway, you'll enjoy this film because it smartly takes what we love about those classic Disney animated fairytales and puts them smack in the middle of our modern-day society...live-action and all.  Normally I am weary of these ""fish out of water"" stories as these unlikely matchups rarely work out well.  I am happy to say that this film works and therefore becomes an exception to that trend.  Amy Adams was enjoyable to watch and she really ought to consider a career on Broadway...seriously, do it now!  Patrick Demsey was funny as the straight-man surrounded by these fairytale characters and his daughter, who totally believes in their origin...I always enjoy the straight man because he's funny without trying.  Was the film cheesey and predictably at times...of course, this is a Disney-created fairytale, but I'm past that.  James Marston is also funny in a more obvious way because he never really embraces 21st century New York City.  Susan Surandon was a good villain, but again, pretty standard and predictably...perfect for this Disney fairytale...even her magic powers didn't surprise me.  The animated squirrel coming to life in New York was pretty cool (apparently the CGI for that took forever...time well spent.)  If you can't already guess, I would recommend this film to Disney fans young and old because it brings together what each generation loves about it's movies.  Enjoy.  P.S.:  If your loved one likes fairytales, it wouldn't be the worst date movie...save it for a fun, silly night.",1381363200,4,1656,5.044117647058823

79638,4,078887148X,"I bought THE ENCHANTED PACIFIC TO THE MAX a couple of months ago on Amazon, and since then I and my family have thoroughly enjoyed watching them. The 6 DVDs cover 5 countries - United States (west coast and Hawaii), Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico - with 2 segments about each country, although 4 segments for the U.S. since Hawaii is treated as another country. The segments are listed as 2 cities but actually include other sites near those cities, and each segment runs 20 to 25 minutes. However, each DVD has a generous set of bonus features that show specific sites in much more detail, so the total time of each disc would be over an hour (This jives with the fact that there are 6 DVDs and the box states ""Over 8 hours."") Bonus features run about 5 to 10 minutes each, and there are 4 to 10 bonus features on each DVD.

The variety of coverage here is quite good, such that for each country host Rudy Maxa shows and discusses music, nature areas, historic sites, parades, dances, museums, and so on. Also, Rudy is a congenial guide who wears well over several hours. Picture and sound quality are fine as seen on a good quality non-high definition TV, and the camerawork and editing are very good.

On Amazon pages for some specific DVDs of this set, I have seen some reviewers complain that 2 segments about each country is not sufficient to give you a sense of an entire country, but I think this works better as a Pacific box set like this. As my family and I watched these, we imagined we were on a cruise of the Pacific Ocean, so stopping at a couple of city-areas in each country makes sense if you watch these that way. However, for each country the coverage is rather brief, so I dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4 because of this. Viewing THE ENCHANTED PACIFIC TO THE MAX as a Pacific Ocean cruise, I do recommend this set quite highly.",1380240000,,1871,4.404624277456647

Directed by Kevin Lima, this Disney fairytale is about a young and beautiful princess named Giselle(Adams), who was destined to marry the charming and brave Prince Edward(Marsden). But his evil step-mother(Sarandon) banishes Giselle from her animated world to the more that real life world of New York City. There, Giselle is smitten by a handsome but hard working widowed father(Dempsey), whose young daughter take a liking to Giselle, So when Edward hears that Giselle is alive and in NYC, he journeys there to win back Giselle's hand hilariously challenge Dempsey's character to a duel, but Edward's step mother is not far behind. The special features includes behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, bloopers and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites. Enchanted was the DVD that would have featured Giselle as the newest Disney Princess, however, Disney's top suits would have to pay Amy Adams for royalties for her likeness of Giselle, so the character was retconned from Disney history, but all of her fans will always consider Giselle as a Disney Princess. :)",1373932800,3,1261,5.471794871794872

79671,5,078887148X,"As a love sick old widower I love this movie.  Also Giselle reminds me of my wife. There is a lot of truth in this movie about relationships.  The writers of this movie knew something about relationships.  When Robert is upset with Giselle because she made a dress out of his curtains Giselle is sad because Robert is ""unhappy"",  not because he does or does not like the dress.  She is sorry that she made him unhappy.  When Robert sends Giselle off in Central park, Giselle  says that because she would not want to do anything that would make him ""unhappy"" she'll go. Then she wishes him every happiness and walks away.  If more people in this ""real"" world in their relationships would be more concerned about the happiness of the other person than there own then this real world would be a much better place. It was impossible for Robert to not become ""Enchanted"" with a woman like that. And then came the ""How does she know"" song.  I would think that many women watching were thinking ""oh how I wish my man would do those things"".  It would be good if men would take heed and do those things.

 The part of the movie I like best is the ballroom dance.  I have never gone dancing and have no wife to dance with but would have loved to when I had a wife.  I would love to dance just like Robert and Giselle in this movie. I watch that part over and over.

I also loved the little girl that played Roberts' daughter. She did a great job.

One part of the movie that was disappointing for a Christian guy is when Nancy shows up to take Morgan to school and discovers that Giselle has spent the night there. In her rant about Giselle spending the night we learn that the reason that Nancy never spent the night was because Robert had a daughter.  Suggesting that if he did not, she would have spent the night.  In such a sweet movie they did not have the put by implication the thought that immorality is normal.  Then again when Robert is angry with Giselle and says to her that now Nancy thinks that ""You and I"" and Giselle says, ""Kissed"" and Robert says, ""Something like that"". In a subtle way they are saying that Nancy is upset because she thinks that  Robert is sleeping with someone else.  That part was disappointing. Also for an old guy like me I would have preferred a little less bosom exposure.

Overall it is a very ""Enchanting"" movie.",1373500800,,2346,4.344827586206897

79685,5,078887148X,"My daughter and I both love this movie.  We love the intersection of animation and live action, the juxtaposition of fairy tale and grim reality.  The little girl who plays the lawyers daughter is charming without being annoying and overly precocious.  And Amy Adams is perfect in this role as a fairy tale character dropped into New York City.  We watch this one over and over.",1371340800,,378,4.681818181818182
79686,5,078887148X,"A different twist on Cinderella, this movie is everything a modern fairy tale should be and more. Amy Adams as Giselle is splendid (and who knew she could sing so well?) as a common girl who is set to marry her Prince Charming (hilariously played by James Marsden), his wicked stepmother (played by Susan Sarandon) pushes  Giselle into a magic pond which transports her into modern day New York where hilarity quickly ensues.  The ending is 100% perfect. This is one for the whole family to watch over and over.  I think it's destined to become a classic.",1371340800,,555,4.642857142857143

79700,5,078887148X,"I watched the film recently for a mood lift because it is a masterfully crafted, whimsical, hilariously clever and at the same time sweet homage to the world of fairy tales and the animated films, that have helped plant their dreams into the heads of little girls. The cast is well, perfectly cast and take each role to its peak. James Marsden is particularly laugh out loud funny as the dashing Prince Edward creating him broadly, boldly, and ever optimistically sure of his mission. Amy Adams is a perfect innocent and  positive Giselle awakening to a world of opposites and adventurous madness in New York City, infecting those she encounters with her magical charm.  The movie can be enjoyed by all ages, the film is beautifully layered to appeal to children, teens, and adults. Delightful movie which, unless you are a Grinch or Ebenezer before his night with the spirits, will leave you grinning and maybe believing in true love's first kiss.",1368403200,,948,4.845679012345679

79702,5,078887148X,"What an adorable film. Amy Adams is near perfection as a ""Disney"" princess thrust out of animation into the real world of modern day NYC. Her mannerisms and personality are exactly what you would expect to see if one of those exquisite ladies were to roam our world. Actually, all the actors whose characters are from the ""animated world"" do an excellent job of bringing their respective characters to real life...Susan Sarandon shines as the evil queen. The prince, Edward, and the queen's flunky, Nathaniel, are both brought into this real world with humor and authenticity as well. Patrick Dempsey does a fine job as man trying to help this out-of-place gal, while getting a different perspective on life and love from her. His daughter is quite the little charmer as she readily accepts this person who seems to have jumped right out of her favorite fairy tale. It gives you everything a Disney animated fantasy would, only in OUR world. Turns out to be a great combination in the end, right up to ""true love's kiss"" and an exciting finish. A truly unique experience. LOVED it!!!",1368144000,,1083,4.7967914438502675
79703,5,078887148X,"Enchanted is a lovely and sweet movie for people of all ages. I think it is due to the sincerity of the actors who, albeit over the top at times, inhabit their characters with honesty. They are not ashamed of the whimsy.

Last time they had a play day with two other little girls and my daughter asked me to play this movie again. Asked me to raise the volume so they could dance again and again.

I don't care about all the critics of this movie by people saying that it is unrealistic bla bla bla. I know it is unrealistic. Most of those Disney princess movies are unrealistic. But it doesn't hurt to dream. Also, that is the reason why we parents have to step in and explain our little girls about make believe, what is real or not, etc.

I myself love this movie. I'm doing the chores while the girls watch it and I find myself glue to scree again.

The only thing I didn't like it that the movie tends to go faster for split seconds, but we won't miss the scenes. I noticed it while we bought a new TV. Never noticed it in my old tv. Then I read the reviews that the movie skips or goes fast. It could be that we had played it so much that we may have damage it a little bit, or that I just never noticed it before. Believe me, the girls won't notice that.

Overall, I would recommend.... I JUST LOVE IT!!!!",1360454400,,1205,4.02928870292887

I hadn't even heard of Amy Adams before this movie, but I absolutely could not imagine anyone playing this role better. A splendid, sparkling performance, memorable.

What a pleasant surprise this was. Amy Adams was wonderful in the role; I'd never been a fan before, but I sure am now. I loved Disney making fun of all their own stories with this movie. Though a few of the performances annoyed me - Susan Sarandon and Idina Metzel, in particular - the rest of the cast makes up for it. The songs were great - my favorite was the big production number, ""That's How You Know"". James Marsden was fantastic in his role as the Prince; the perfect balance of comedy and buffoon, and at last, sensitive Prince Charming. Truly, Adams & Marsden had the most challenging roles in this film - confused, lost, befuddled fairy-tale characters thrust into the bustling modern world - and they both nailed it.",1357948800,,873,4.355828220858895

79780,4,078887148X,"This movie proves that Disney doesn't take itself too seriously, at least not all the time.

I'm sure you've seen a bunch of those movies, all vaguely the same, with some beautiful princess and some dashing prince. They seek each other out for True Love, overcoming great hardships through derring-do and gratuitous bursts of song. What the True Lovers lack in the way of everyday pragmatics, they more than make up for impractical clothing.

Now dump that ethereal belief in frilly gowns and eternal romance into the rain-soaked lap of a New York divorce lawyer. The hope of eternal passion should simply die under the legal eye of a man whose job is to end marriages, and its corpse get trampled into the city's grunge. Instead, we see a spectacular satire on the Disney themes. Even the princess's magical command of the woodland animals translates neatly into the world of urban pests, complete with a song routine that I could scarcely hear over my own laughing.

Young kids might enjoy this. It features plenty of broad comedy, and most of the dangers seem mild and story-bookish enough that they're not truly threatening. There's something here for the slightly more sophisticated tweenager, too. Most inmportantly, its offers enough cleverness to reward the adult who pays for the kids to see it.

79791,3,078887148X,"Giselle is an animated figure who greatly resembles Cinderella, who makes friends with small animals and sings about the prince who will come for her with ""true love's kiss."" Edward is the prince with a wicked stepmother who is a powerful sorceress, complete with poisoned apples. Edward meets Giselle, they are drawn to one another immediately, and prepare to be married at once. The stepmother has been trying to keep Edward away from girls, because if he marries and produces an heir, her reign as queen will be over.

When the wicked old crone (the queen in disguise, of course) pushes Giselle into a well, she comes out of a manhole cover in New York City as a real flesh-and-blood girl in an incredible poofy wedding gown. She is totally clueless about the ways of this strange world, and that's where most of the humor comes from. Edward dives into the well to save Giselle, and also comes out fleshly (quite cute, but equally clueless) in NYC, along with his chipmunk friend.

Giselle was helped by Robert, a divorce lawyer with a six-year-old daughter, who is also trying to propose to his long-time girlfriend. They are rational, sensible people who do not believe in romance. Sure. Giselle is naturally a bit of a complication for them. She also manages to be quite a complication for his law practice: crying over a couple who is breaking up ""forever and ever"" where Robert represents the wife and they are down to fighting over the baseball card collection, card by card.

Now here's a funny one for Harry Potter fans: the queen's toady, whom she sends into the well to deliver the poison apples or somehow get rid of Giselle, is played by the guy who played Wormtail aka Peter Pettigrew. He's rapidly getting typecast as the villain's toady.

I sometimes struggle to find things my daughter and I 'connect' with (big burly Dad and sweet little girl don't always have the same interests!), and this movie was a layup for one of those shared experiences we will both cherish.

79793,4,078887148X,"This is really the definition of ""light entertainment,"" and seriously, I am still smiling about it now. After getting in the way of an Evil Queen, a fairytale princess is cast into an alternate reality--the real world as we know it--and must survive there until her rescue by her Prince Charming. Hmm! From the trailer I saw, my guess was that ""Enchanted"" was a one-joke show, a series of cynical gags about how fairytale magic falls on its face in the real world. That Disney has managed to squeeze at least four or five good jokes out of the idea, and mixed in a few sprinkles of profundity on top of that, is something of an achievement. As a romp, it works fairly well, and it delivered quite a lot more than I was expecting.

This is a risky film to make, and Disney gets points for having the guts to unleash this oddity on the holiday season. It's a fun film that isn't afraid to go, occasionally, in weird and startling directions.

The intersection of the two worlds--the world of faith and magic, and the world of disillusionment and hard reality--creates the expected comedic drama at first. Then the two opposing realities begin to influence and change each other in unsettling and stimulating ways that may surprise the audience. The ideas aren't fully developed, but a crucial detail was attended to at the wrap-up that satisfied me--the main characters succeed mainly because they are able to grow beyond their previous conceptions of themselves.

Along the way of telling this story, we get to see a very challenging film production featuring two distinct worlds and their accompanying designs, and the intermingling of these two worlds. It's occasionally heavy on visual effects and animated sequences, but the effects are always story-driven and never gratuitous--a surprising enough thing nowadays that it's worth taking note of. Strong film-making skills, with an old-school sensibility, are at work.

As an extra bonus, there is an audacious, overblown MGM-style singing/dancing sequence, the kind that is so rarely seen in movies nowadays. Go see it!",1335830400,,2072,4.945402298850575

79800,5,078887148X,"A few years ago Disney made a return to a movie musical something that they hadn't done since 1998's Disney animated movie Mulan, and the movie is this movie Enchanted that will sure to leave you enchanted. It combines animation with live action, and if you liked a lot of earlier Disney animated movies you are sure you going to love the references to their animated movies. The cast includes Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Wicked's Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, Susan Sarandon, but Amy Adams steals the show with her performance. Disney also brought back Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz to do the songs for this movie. A few good ones, but does fall short of how many songs are normally have been in their musical Disney animated movies. As the movie opens Giselle (Amy Adams)  lives in the animated world of Andalasia, and with the help of her animal friends makes a picture or dummy, or whatever of her true love. And she sings about him, and true love's kiss. And we meet Prince Edward (James Marsden) who is chasing after a troll, and they both hear her and follow to find out where her voice is coming from. The troll gets there first of course, but not so long after he comes and saves her, and they quickly they fall in love, and they plan a quick wedding the next day. And then we meet Prince Edward's step-mother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) gets wind of their plan and starts her plan to save her throne that she will lose if Prince Edward marries. Giselle shows up at Prince Edward's castle in her wedding dress, and Narissa tricks her, and throw her down a wishing well that has a portal, and she tells her henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) that she has thrown her to a place with no happily ever afters, the place turns out to be New York City, and she finds herself in Times Square, lost and confused and doesn't know how to get back to Andalasia. And she doesn't have some very good adventures to begin with, but soon spots a billboard with a castle on top, and she manges to get on it for help. Where she is seen from inside a taxi cab from a young girl named Morgan (Rachel Covey), while riding with her father named Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) who is a divorce lawyer. He helps her out, and he brings back to his apartment, where he wants to phone for a cab, but his daughter wants her to stay with them, he does call for a cab but after really looking at her, he changes his mind and hangs up the phone. He is planning to purpose to his girlfriend Nancy (Idina Menzel). The next morning she wakes up and sees how much of a mess their apartment is, calls for help for the town's animals and clean ip up while singing a song. While Morgan wakes up and sees what is happening and wakes up her father, and he is mad to see that Giselle had mad her a dress out of his curtains. Nancy shows up to pick Morgan up for school for some girl bonding time, does understand what going on, gets angry and leaves. By way let me tell you what is going to happen, just watch the movie and just enjoy it for yourself with all its songs, references and cast members that are in the movie.",1325289600,,3130,4.359589041095891

79803,4,078887148X,"Enchanted is a movie that's hard for me to recommend for certain people. On one hand, it's enjoyable for the whole family, has some genuinely funny moments, and Amy Adams does a great job with her character. On the other hand, it could've been so much more if Disney had loosened up a little, or maybe if the movie had been handled by another company, and could end up disappointing certain viewers who see the whole thing as 'typical'. It sounds weird, but when you watch Enchanted, you'll see what I mean. This is a movie that really did surprise me here and there with some of the jokes they were getting away with while keeping everything PG. I went into this one with very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised in the end. If Disney were to continue making live action movies similar to this, I think they could have some easy money on their hands, and they could finally stop using that Pixar crutch that they're so fond of now.

The movie starts out in the animated world of Andalasia, where Princess Giselle sings with the woodland creatures, and is excited to marry Prince Edward so they can live happily ever after, as most Disney princesses do. But, Edward has an evil step-mother, Queen Narissa, who desperately wants to keep the throne to herself, doing anything to get Giselle out of the picture. How badly does she want to stay queen? Well, she sends Giselle right into the real-life world just a few minutes into the movie. Yep, just like that, Giselle is out of the happy land full of cuddly animals that help her out, and into the not-so-cuddly streets of New York. Needless to say, things get crazy. She ends up meeting a guy named Robert, who has a daughter that loves princesses. Robert has a girlfriend though, who meets Giselle for the first time when she walks out of Robert's shower, leading to a couple issues. Meanwhile, Prince Edward is transported to the real world too, along with his companion who's working for Narissa. He's determined to find Giselle and bring her back to Andalasia, but is she ready to go back after realizing how weird the whole 'happily ever after' thing is? Chances are, if you've seen a few Disney movies before, you already know how this is all going to end up, but it has a few twists here and there.

I don't want to ruin some of the best jokes in the movie, but some of the dialogue exchanged during Giselle's introduction to Robert's girlfriend is some of the best I've heard in a family comedy in a long time. Giselle, who is such a goody-good princess without a single negative thought in her head, doesn't get what Robert's girlfriend thought was going on after she comes out of the shower, and thinks hugs and kisses over...well, you know. Giselle's like that for the majority of the movie, and it's not overdone either. She's a terrific character, and a great Disney princess, despite not being in the same league as Mulan, Pocahontas, Jasmine or Tiana. She's a stereotypical princess that's -enjoyable- to watch, and I didn't think that was possible. It doesn't hurt that Amy Adams is a very good singer too, with 'Happy Working Song' being so memorable that I immediately got the track after hearing it. But the other characters are pretty good too, with Prince Edward trying his best to slay a bus, Robert trying to work divorce cases (without much success when Giselle helps one couple get back together), and Narissa looking mighty fine in that leather outfit of hers. If someone had told me that I'd get to see Susan Sarandon in a tight leather outfit, I probably would've bought the movie before renting it first. Important things like that should be stated on the box in huge font. Anyway, the story, while predictable, is cute and I love how they made fun of typical Disney plot devices. Giselle suddenly wondering what would happen if she marries Edward, and what exactly she'd do, was nice to see in a movie like this, and there were many other similar points brought up.

And that's where I hold back from giving the movie a full 5 stars- they have all these good points and jokes, making fun of the fairy tale story and characters, but decided to play things safe. Enchanted has some situations that a lot of people, especially adults, can relate to. I know I shouldn't be expecting much 'because it's Disney', but if they had just pushed on a little more with Giselle questioning things, what it means to be in love, and a couple of other things, Enchanted could've been an extremely good movie, and an instant classic. Instead, it's just a nice one to watch now and then with the family, with very little objectionable content. My only other complaint is that, even for when the movie was made, the CG is very poor. I don't know if Disney was low on money after Pirates of the Caribbean or what, but the CG animals and dragon towards the end had me shaking my head in shame. If you thought the animals in the beginning of I Am Legend were bad, wait until you get a load of these guys. But they're only in the movie for a few minutes, so it's not that big of a deal. Still, it's odd seeing such poor visual effects from Disney. At least the 2D animated bits are done well, as were Susan Surandon's...moving on!

The blu-ray transfer is impressive, though there's not a whole lot to show off the format here. Colors are solid, everything is crystal clear, and the ballroom sequence is especially beautiful. The audio is just as good with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround mix. There are also Dolby Digital 5.1 audio tracks in English, Spanish and French, with subtitles in those languages as well if you need them. As for the special features, what's here might look like a lot at first, but it's pretty light. First up is a little trivia track that plays along with the movie, testing your Disney knowledge. Fantasy Comes to Life is a featurette on three of the musical sequences in the movie. Pip's Predicament is a weird, barely animated look at what happens to Pip when Giselle is transported to New York. There are also bloopers and 6 deleted scenes, none of which added much and were deleted for good reason. Oh, and there's a video of Ever Ever After sung by Carrie Underwood thrown on here too.

Overall, I like Enchanted a lot. I love Giselle and Narissa, Happy Working Song is one of my top 10 Disney songs now, and while they don't really go anywhere new with the plot, it's enjoyable. For a movie to watch with your kids, you could do much worse.",1323388800,,6438,4.541774332472007

Her performance is so charming, so sweet and just plain believable that it really makes you happy watching her and the story. I can't say that about a lot of films including Disney movies.

The rest of the acting is perfect with a story that is quite entertaining. The musical numbers are great too with Amy involving some cool film effects using animals in the scenes. And they don't over-do the music in this one which can drag a film down at times.

Instead of sticking to strictly animation, Disney throws a wrench into the cogs of most Disney films to combine both animation and live action. Giselle, our heroine and princess, is banished by a wicked step mother who is trying to keep the innocent young maiden from taking over her throne by marrying her step-son Edward. Giselle is thrown from her animated world to a place where there is no ""love"" and ""happily ever afters"" aka New York City!

She's completely lost in this hubbub of real life where nobody is nice and she is hopelessly stranded. Nobody sings, people get angry, and love can be broken ""forever and ever"". Amongst this madness she meets Robert, engaged to Nancy, and his young daughter Morgan who is absolutely enthralled with the prospect that Giselle is a real princess. What follows is a funny adventure that slowly effects the steadfast Robert and the eccentric Giselle. In a world where there is no magic a completely magical story blooms, reminding us that magic is what we make it out to be and it can be just as glorious as any fairy tale.

79829,4,078887148X,"Once upon a time, there were spoilers.

I admit, I put off seeing this movie for the longest time.  I really should have seen it when it first came out.  It got rave reviews, and lots of people liked it, but then, lots of people like lots of things that I don't, and from the film's description, I was fairly certain that I wouldn't enjoy it at all, so I just didn't watch it.

In fact, I only watched this because it was recommended to me by my brother, who not only suggested it to me, but was good enough to loan me his copy of the DVD.  So, I decided to look at this film, and judge it from my own perspective.  I actually love the old fairy tales, and especially the quiet nobility with which many of their protagonists faced the world, and I very much expected this film to be nothing more than a full-on deconstruction of not just fairy tale tropes, but the precious nobility and ethics they represent as well.  Still, a free movie is a free movie.  Needless to say, I went into this film expecting to be disappointed.

The story starts with a meeting between Giselle; a beautiful peasant girl who dreams of marrying a prince (and has a large cabal of talking woodland friends, who help her do chores and make clothes for her,) and Edward; a powerful warrior prince, who ties up a thirty-foot troll in his first scene on screen, and seems to have a very honorable, if somewhat untamed and ferocious spirit.  They meet and fall in love within seconds, because that's the kind of world they live in.

I admit that this first scene didn't impress me.  I watched Sleeping Beauty less than a month ago, and I don't remember any of those animals talking, much less calling the princesses ""honey,"" as the squirrel of Giselle's group does.  On top of that, it seems like they sort of rush through this bit, because the whole, bare-bones setting, and the near-total lack of back story for any of these characters makes it seem like more of a parody of a fairy tale, as done by someone who didn't know anything about fairy tales.  Still, I sat through the scene.

Apparently, Prince Edward's mother (a sort of mash-up of the Wicked Queen from Snow White, Maleficent, and Gozer from the Ghostbusters) only has control of the throne until he marries, because she does everything she can to get Giselle out of the way, short of... you know... actually thinking about it.  Her first attempt against Giselle is to shove her into a magic portal to our world, and yet, later in the film, we learn that she has poison apples too, and shoving her through the portal just winds up making it harder to poison her, so I really don't see what the point was.  I'm on the verge of calling this a plot hole, but as we find out later, the Queen isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.

Once she winds up in our world, Giselle goes through several uncomfortable scenes of acting very goofy and trusting in the middle of New York City, until she meets up with a lawyer named Robert.  He's shown handling a potential divorce case in more than once scene, and this is the only case we see him handle.  Furthermore, it's later stated that he actually requested the case.  Still, I hesitate to call him a ""divorce lawyer,"" because there's nothing in the film to suggest that he never takes other kinds of cases.  All the same, this is a severe black mark on his record.  Where I come from, divorce is a sin, not a living.

Fortunately, the poor schlub runs into Giselle, which is as fortunate for her, since she needs a place to stay for the night.  He lets her stay at his place, and this is where the movie really starts to shine.  Giselle's ability to encourage animals to do chores for her, and her tendency to break out into impromptu song and dance numbers, as well as her wholesome, if somewhat naive outlook on life, immediately turn Robert's world upside down.  I really enjoyed watching these scenes; not just because Giselle was a charming onscreen presence, but because these are the kind of things I like to see in a movie.  To use a well-known potterism, it's all about giving the muggles a scare.

Still, even when Robert is scared of Giselle, he seems to realize that she's a benevolent force, and he takes her around town for a while.  There's a scene of Giselle reacting badly (as well she should) to the very concept of divorce, though she doesn't seem to understand how, exactly, to keep a relationship from breaking down.  Fortunately, the couple figures it out on their own; that it's all about making sacrifices and toughing it out for the purpose of the good times they have together, though it's a rather subdued message, and not dwelled on enough.

By this time, Prince Edward and his pal Nathaniel; who's secretly in love with the wicked queen, show up in our world too, looking for Giselle, and there's a subplot about Nathaniel trying to poison Giselle with the apples I mentioned earlier, as well as a chipmunk named Pip, who tries to save her, but frankly, I have nothing to say about it.  It's the usual bland, stupid cinema fare, in which the bad guy has an unaccountably easy time disguising himself as bystanders, and coming up with implausible excuses to give her apples, all while acting uncommonly like one of the Three Stooges.  He's never threatening, and I don't find him funny either, so to me, these scenes are just meaningless filler.

While spending time with Robert, Giselle learns about a ""date,"" in which people spend time together before getting married.  She's very confused by the concept, because it seems like the idea of spending time with someone before marrying them is new to her.  I was going to call nonsense on this, because they did have courtships in the middle ages, but then I remembered that Giselle is from a parody of the middle ages, so I'm keeping my mouth shut for now.  Still, I think it would have made it a big challenge for Disney to paint Giselle as imperfect if she'd seemed to have the savvy for courtships, commitment and marital sacrifice.  I'm not surprised that they refused to take up that challenge, but I am disappointed.

Eventually, Giselle and Edward are reunited, and they go on a date.  Giselle wants to go to a costume ball with him too, and here's where the movie takes a brief nosedive in quality.  It's been a while since Giselle has done any musical numbers, or interacted with any animals, and now we have a scene of her being taken shopping by Robert's daughter, who swipes his credit card and buys her a dress, which, in the real middle ages, would have gotten her mistaken for a prostitute.  Honestly, I found that dress the least realistic thing about the whole movie, and yes; that includes all the magic and talking animals, because there is no way that a girl from the middle ages who is innocent in pure would ever dress in something that seems designed to show off as much of her upper back, shoulders, arms and bre...  Oh, wait.  My mistake.  Again, Giselle is from a parody of the middle ages, so I can't really lodge this complaint properly, since I know nothing about the weird, mixed-up rules that her world runs on.  It still felt out of place, though, and combined with the seeming loss of her ""princess powers,"" left me with the depressing sense that Giselle was becoming the worst thing you can ever be.  Normal.

I'm going off on a rant here, so if you want, you can skip this paragraph, because it's just about my personal view of this.  Throughout the first half of the movie, Giselle seems like Pippi Longstocking to me; a strange character in a real world, who changes everyone's lives for the better because she's so different from them.  As the film progresses, however, she gradually changes into a party pooper of sorts, who no longer sings, no longer hangs out with animals, and wears the single most butt-ugly dress at the entire costume ball.  I don't know if they did that on purpose, but suddenly, I found that Giselle had been diminished into a mere muggle by her experiences, and that doesn't fly with me.  I didn't want her to accept her lot and become normal.  I wanted her to continue exalting everyone else.  At this point in the film, I was starting to get very mad with it.

The evil queen shows up, poisons Giselle, and here, it's revealed that Robert is actually her true love.  To his credit, Prince Edward accepts this graciously, though he hasn't been as impressive as Giselle for most of the film, unfortunately.  He seems more than a little dim; failing to understand long words, and calling people ""peasant"" wherever he goes.  Still, as I said, he accepts the disappointment of losing Giselle without skipping a beat, and he is chivalrous enough to clearly care about her well-being, and want what's best for her, instead of being selfish.  I think that in the end, the person who really won out in this film was Nancy; the girl he winds up marrying in fairy tale land.  Still, he could have been a more charming prince.

Wicked queen turns into a dragon; kidnaps Robert, and the princess rescues him with a sword and a chipmunk.  Honestly, I was a little annoyed by this, because while by itself, it's harmless, there's been an uncomfortable trend of men being emasculated and needing to be saved by women in films recently.  Still, as I said, if it weren't for that trend, this one exception wouldn't be a problem.  It's almost like America is trying to apologize for Japan for some reason, and is becoming just as annoyingly predictable in the process.

Anyway, there's an ending sequence where we see Edward and Nancy getting married, and Robert and Giselle apparently wind up together in the real world, which is what I was afraid of, though we do get some scenes of her making clothes with the help of animals, implying that she can still sing and do her doctor dolittle thing when she wants to, which I guess is a relief.

Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this film, because it doesn't seem to want to take a stand on anything.  It points out that both Giselle's world and our world are weak and imperfect, which is true, but it's a meaningless statement, because Giselle's world is just a straw man world created as a parody of fairy tales.  Of course it's ridiculous.  It's a parody.  Parodies are made to be ridiculous.  I just don't see the point.  There are hints that the message is that love is more complicated than in fairy tales, hints that it's not, hints that love is, but dreams and wishes can still come true and we should be optimistic, etc, etc...  However, all of these potential messages are muddled by the others.  It's like a whole crowd of writers were trying to pen this movie at once, each with different ideas of what the moral at the end should be, and none of them really got their point across sufficiently.

At the end of the film, I find that the only thing that really made an impact on me was Giselle herself; at least the version of her from the first half of the film, who, as I said, came across as Pippi Longstocking, with a dash of Mary Poppins sprinkled in, but if that's all they wanted to accomplish with this movie, one wonders just why they didn't keep her like that for the whole film, instead of doing so many adjustment subplots.  Yes, I get that it's character development, but I honestly thought that it only served to take away from the movie's total quality.

At the end, I have to give this film a B-.  I didn't hate it the way I thought I would, but there was certainly room for improvement, and they still need to clear up just exactly what Robert does for a living, and encourage him to stop defending divorce.  Other than that, it's not a bad film, though it has a lot of mixed messages, and it might be unwise to show it to your kids without watching it once yourself first.  Or you could just avoid the problem altogether by renting Sleeping Beauty instead.",1293235200,,11841,4.506086142322097

79833,1,078887148X,"This review is for the Blu-ray version.

First of all I really like this movie. This review is about the disc, not the movie.

I'm giving it one star because Disney disabled automatic resume and loaded it with previews that are difficult to avoid.

This disc will start from the beginning, even if you had stopped viewing right in the middle of the movie.

This is a important if you don't watch the movie in one sitting. If you turn off the player you have go go through all the warnings before you can continue where you left off.

Normally that would rate two stars in my book. I took off another star because Disney also loaded this disc with previews which will not be relevant in a few years. The only way to avoid watching them is to hit the main menu button as soon as possible. Skipping the track will just cycle you through the previews. You'll have to watch or navigate past them even if you're continuing viewing from the middle of the movie.

The quality of transfer is excellent, but if you'll be stopping this movie and returning to it later, you'd be happier with the DVD. DVDs don't have all the Java ""enhancements"" and you'll be able to avoid all the previews and the Disney commercial.

The programmer loaded this with code, it takes a while for the main menu to appear. I'm using an OPPO BDP-83, so my player isn't slow. Someone using a slow player is bound to find this frustrating.",1283385600,6,1403,4.4147286821705425

The worst so far, that my husband and I have watched is Mexico.  Dennis Prager said, ""The Left lives in a bubble"", while the Right has to put up with all this Leftist drivel, even in what should be a harmless travel video.

The ""brutal"" Spanish conquistadors, conquered the Aztecs.  Does anyone have a problem with this statement?  Oh and after they did they turned around and allowed the capital city of the Aztecs to keep its name Mexica, while the Spaniards built a Catholic Cathedral on top of it.  And we all know that the Aztecs never called themselves Aztecs, no they were Mexica, except when all them joined forces, then they were Aztecs, except when they weren't calling themselves Aztecs, because the only 2 people to call them Aztecs were both white guys.[...]

Boy this is starting to sound more like the New Math than the history of Mexico.

And check out this website:  [...] Everyone here wants to go back 5 or 6 hundred years.  Wouldn't that be lovely and the Left says it is impossible to send 12 million illegal aliens back to Mexico, this group wants to send 300 million Americans back to Europe.

Now back to Mr. Maxa's DVD, if you are like me, I thought the capital city of the Aztecs was called Tenochtitlan, but no it was called Mexica-Tenochtitlan or Tenochtitlan-Mexica, because when the Aztecs moved into the neighborhood and took it over, they called it that, except they didn't. [...]

See I was taught in school Mexico got its name from mestizo, meaning mixed race.  Unlike the thinking of this blogger on the Democratic [...]:  [...]

The Spaniards didn't mix freely with the indigenous population, they murdered, raped and pillaged. Not that the murdering Aztecs, didn't deserve their fate, but that is quite a stretch to think that the Spaniards, married their conquest, but the racist Anglo-Dutch, didn't.  No and the Anglo-Dutch didn't wipe the natives and their cultures off the face of the earth, forcing them to become Catholic, to give up their native languages and customs.  Where are the Aztecs of today?[...]

In the United States there are over 550 recognized tribes-[...]

No wonder the Latinos (Latin the language of the catholic church) and Latinas (Latin from the Roman Empire) are so confused (mestizo-mixed up).  Look what they are being taught.

Amexem is the original name of this place called America:  [...]

Here again I thought North and South America were named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer and map maker. [...]

I know you can find anything on the net, but when it starts to be taught as historical fact rather than opinion and placed in Travel DVD's it is startling.

The New Zealand episode with the indigenous? Maori (they came from somewhere else and murdered and enslaved the Polynesians, who got to New Zealand before them- Sidebar: I thought only white Americans enslaved people), they make up fifteen percent of the 4.5 million living in New Zealand.  And where are those Aztecs again?  The aggressive and threatening greeting at the Maori Cultural Center is priceless.  I kept thinking of the first Indian Jones movie and the threatening Sultan with that gigantic sword.  Indian pulls out a pistol and shoots him.

The story begins with the generic animation of a sweet girl name Giselle (Amy Adams), surrounded by talking and singing animals.  She wants to find her true love as a handsome prince (James Marsden) trots through the forest on his trusty horse.  Of course they finally see each other and fall in love.  He proposes marriage and a day later they are to be married.  This is usually where the story ends with ""they lived happily ever after.""

The Prince has a wicked stepmother played by Susan Sarandan.  She looks like the stepmother in Disney's classic Sleeping Beauty.  She is jealous that the prince has finally found a girl to love, because if he marries, she will lose her throne.  So she tricks Giselle to look down a well and pushes her down into the real world.  Giselle ends up in the middle of Times Square in New York City, dressed in a flouncy frock but still full of sweet positive thoughts and a perky personality.

The evil queen keeps her eye on Giselle and threatens to kill her with a poisoned apple.  Giselle ends up in the home of a divorced divorce attorney and his young daughter.  He is engaged to be married, but takes Giselle in because she is so helpless and his daughter loves her princess like qualities.

79862,4,078887148X,"This is a terrifically entertaining -- and clever -- film, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

But... If I might get serious...

Leonard Bernstein once said that no composer consciously sets out to write ""insincere"" music. ""Enchanted"" is a conscious parody of Disney style and content that, at the same time, tries to remain sincere. But parody is inherently un-sincere. It's difficult to spoof something while treating it ingenuously. The two work against each other.

This is most apparent in the film's best sequence -- the ""Happy Little Working Song"", which skewers ""Whistle While You Work"". The former brutally satirizes what is implicit in the latter -- dirty, filthy animals are cleaning up the place, including the dishes! Stephen Schwartz couldn't resist having Giselle acknowledge that the rats, roaches, and pigeons are ""vermin"", or having her sing:

""We'll keep singing without fail, otherwise we'd spoil it,
Hosing down the garbage pail and scrubbing up the toilet."",

something the ""real"", naive Giselle would never sing. But this is a spoof, so why not? The sequence ends with a slap at ""Disney cute"" -- one of the pigeons eats a cockroach. If we hadn't caught on that the film was a take-off, we know now.

The problem is that there's no easy way to balance sincerity and spoof. It's not unlike making a comic horror film. James Whale did it -- once -- and no one else has quite duplicated it, not even Sam Raimi. ""Enchanted""'s script and direction lean on the sincere side, without going overboard on the send-up. But the result isn't sincere enough to draw any strong emotion, while the parody lacks ""edge"" -- except in the scene mentioned. There's no way this obviously tongue-in-cheek tone could have been continued throughout the rest of the film without -- well, spoiling it.

It would be unfair -- and insincere -- to ask Bill Kelly (the writer) and Kevin Lima (the director) to achieve what is virtually impossible. So I won't. Just enjoy ""Enchanted"" for what it is -- a Disney self-parody that's been a long time coming.

Parents should be aware that the PG rating includes ""mild innuendo"" -- /sexual/ innuendo, both straight and gay. It will probably go right over most toddlers' heads, but don't be surprised if you get the odd question or two. (""Mommy, why is that man smiling at the prince?"")

This BD is typical of Disney, which is to say, gorgeous. Other than a game and some bloopers, there's nothing on the BD that wasn't on the DVD. But the animation, costumes, sets, and effects benefit greatly from high definition.",1257120000,,2551,4.859447004608295

79865,5,078887148X,"Enchanted (directed by Kevin Lima) is a modern day fairytale that weaves comedy, song and dance and storybook fantasies together. The result is a delightful Disney movie that puts a spin on the classic `fairytale' story.

The movie begins in Andalasia; an animated fairytale world full of merriment, song and adventure. Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) is a young, Snow White-esque character that spends her days cleaning her house, singing with her animal friends and awaiting the day her prince charming will come and sweep her off of her feet. He arrives one day in the form of Prince Edward (James Marsden). They fall in love on a whim and plan to marry the next day.

Edward's evil stepmother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), however, wants the kingdom for herself and, in an attempt to get rid of her, pushes Giselle into a portal that leads to our world. She lands in New York City where she meets Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). Giselle must then choose between both worlds and along the way discovers what true love really is.

Amy Adams shines as the doe-eyed Giselle. Her innocence to the 'real' world she has tumbled into is both charming and humorous. She transitions from a nave fairytale princess who is perfectly fine with having her prince rescue her to a woman who ends up saving the day. Adams shows us that Disney princesses are not merely along for the ride and that each and every one of them are independent souls capable of shaping their own destinies.

Marsden keeps us laughing with his sheer obliviousness to almost everything that is going on around him. The fact that a chipmunk (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Kevin Lima) just may be smarter than the prince is equally humorous. The fairytale characters reactions to New York City are also laugh out loud. The scene where Prince Edwards has to slay the beast (a NYC bus!) is clever and helps the audience to understand how tough a transition it's going to be for the animated characters. The thousands of Disney references are also fun to look for. Like discovering that Robert's secretary voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid.

Enchanted is a light-hearted comedy that the entire family will enjoy. It masterfully strings together humor and songs that results in pure entertainment. By the end it will have even the most cynical person singing along.",1256256000,2,2362,4.836633663366337

79867,5,078887148X,"Enchanted is when a fairy tale meets reality. It's hilarious and more than entertaining! Most fairy tales are very idealized and very unrealistic, hence the name. When these two worlds collide, what happens, but laughter and very disney-esque singing. Amy Adams proves she's fit to sing and sound like a true Disney princess, not to mention act just like one. She plays the part very well and in a most entertaining manner. James Marsden is the perfect clueless handsome prince who makes us laugh at every turn in his hopes of finding his true love. I love this movie and it never fails to make me laugh. It has a fantastic soundtrack and introduces the beautiful singing of not only Amy Adams, but John McLaughlin. This fairy tale movie can be enjoyed by all ages!",1255478400,,765,4.674074074074074

Selfish and cruel, she lived in fear that one day her stepson would marry and she would lose her throne forever.  And so she did all in her power to prevent the prince from ever meeting the one special maiden with whom he would share true love's kiss...""

So begins a truly inspired, unique and oftentimes even self-deprecating, tongue-in-cheek vehicle from the Disney studios, one unlike almost anything Disney or any other studio has ever produced.  For while it all starts out traditionally enough such as previous Disney classics including ""Cinderella,"" ""Snow White,"" and many others, about ten or so minutes in, the whole musically animated ""cartoon"" abruptly enters the real, live-action world (eventually enhanced by more animation and great CGI) of modern-day New York City (via a street sewer manhole no less).  Following the rather traditional animated opening shots however, which I found and still do, rather boring and trite, from the real life sequences on, the endless superlative moments of this one-of-a-kind movie really take off and fly high all the way.  The actual happenings?

Well, see, there's this older, ugly, evil queen Narissa who sends the younger, lovely. innocent heroine princess Giselle into a mostly non-animated, less-musical, cynical reality (ours), where she must adjust to and learn to interact with a strange new world, with odd people and their peculiar customs and culture, and almost incomprehensible situations.  Otherwise known as ""our world,"" more or less present day.  Baffling and bizarre as Giselle (and those from her animated fantasy world who follow her) finds everything and everyone in her new reality, most there find her just as strange.  But it all works out in the end (oops, a spoiler, me bad).  Within the film however, everything is eventually turned upside down and inside out, in many more ways than one.  In fact, this quality, of mixing live action dominated scenes with animation, is the ultimately undeniable charm of it all, if one's heart is still somewhat innocent and open to such ideas.

Mixing animated and live sequences liberally, most of the time employing a breathtakingly. non-apologetically, refreshing wish and faith in the true and eternal essence and wealth of ""romantic"" love, along with some great music and individual songs, the sum of the whole creates the inimitable and essential satisfaction this gem surely is.  But without hesitation, I must say that it is the utterly gorgeous and terrifically talented Amy Adams (Giselle) who makes all of this really, really work, suspending disbelief effortlessly and increasingly along the way.

This movie put Ms. Adams squarely on the ""Hollywood"" map and rightly so, although no academy awards or even nominations came her way for this.  Since then however, fans have discovered in later films that she is not only artistically stunning to look at, in whatever role, but is also a fairly great actress in general, and not a bad singer or dancer to boot.  That's about all I'll say here about the plot, story, characters, and general gist of the film and how it all majestically unfolds, but only to avoid revealing any fatal spoilers for first-time and uninitiated viewers.  I do envy open minded, open hearted, first-timers to this continually, amazingly, astonishing flick however.  It is certainly not for all tastes, but is definitely one for folks of all ages, including all except perhaps very young toddlers and younger, who may find the dragon scenes a bit nightmarish.  As this sometimes too young-at-heart viewer did at least.

Once upon a time, a few years ago, I was watching several movie trailers on my cable on-demand service when I happened upon one for something called ""Enchanted.""  At first, the trailer wasn't interesting to me, because it started out with classic Disney animation sequences, and I have never particularly been a Disney fan in general.  But right before I was about to diss the film, the hokey animation of the trailer suddenly transformed into a live-action film and story.  That was enough to interest me back then, and after finally getting to see it on cable more than once, I can sincerely say this has become one of my favorite films of all time.

While not necessarily impressed much when I first watched this, I tuned in now and then, as this was endlessly rerun on cable, to certain parts of the film, and found myself enjoying most of the experience, more and more than when I initially watched it.  This goes especially for three aspects of this film, which makes for a unique and wonderful cinematic experience upon first and repeated viewings.  One, it is almost ironically but brilliantly ""anarchist"" in its tone of being a somewhat ""anti-Disney"" fantasy from Disney, until the welcome and credible ""Disney"" drift/ending.  Two, Amy Adams renders so enchanting a performance, her character portrayal such acting genius, and so sprightly and lovable and romantic, it's hard not to fall in love with her, if not thus the film.  While the featured songs and music here have a subtle effect at first, upon several viewings, the score and songs, along with effective character developments and the splendidly choreographed dance numbers, really grow on one.  That is, if one still has that innocently unspoiled, romantic love, fantasy-filled,  totally unrealistic view on life, like I apparently still do.

Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz did the essential music for this and did a fine job indeed.  Besides the great, general instrumental/orchestral parts, the individual songs and song/dance-numbers really shine, especially the ""Happy Working Song,"" ""That's How You Know,"" and ""Ever Ever After.""  Three deserved hit songs from any film, but my favorite is ""That's How You Know.""  The visuals that go along with this, are unforgettable.  I wonder these days what kind of person couldn't warm up to this filmed bit of enchantment unless they have a really cold, dead heart and aren't willing or able to fully open up that heart to something truly joyful.  Sure, it's all happy ending fairy-tale fantasy (and perhaps ""nonsense"" to some), but that's actually all it sets out to do and it does so brilliantly.  Disney archetypal characters and ideas abound here, but even as a long time Disney skeptic (I'm more of a ""Futurama"" animation fan), I think this effort as a whole is endlessly surprising, refreshing and original.

For those who try to take most or all of this dead seriously or in the end, too unrealistically impractical, I think both will miss the point, and may not like this.  This is, what it is, does much more than it seems to promise, and for me is an absolutely astonishing, drenched with fanciful hope and romance feel good wonder of a movie.  As I suppose, are most of my hundreds of personal favorite films.  If any of this doesn't interest you in the slightest, stay away from this movie, by all means.  For others, like idealistic, ever ever after true romance believing fools like this 50-something (moi), it's totally innovative and inventive throughout, and a truly congenial roller coaster ride I, and perhaps you, will love to watch and indulge in, again and again.  For collectors of movies you love and want to own, this is a must buy.

Regardless of whether the individual watching buys into various facets of any of this, which may take some patience and more than one viewing to do so as it did for me, it all really works great in my opinion.  And it fully lives up to the most important, obviously stressed and desired perception of a fanciful, hoped-for ""reality"" the creators attempted here.  Which is (okay, sorry, the ultimate spoiler which I've hinted at, I guess), unabashedly wrapped up in the very last line...

""And so, they all lived happily ever after...""",1255305600,3,7866,4.97782874617737
79869,1,078887148X,"If you've ever seen Disney films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, you may appreciate the many references to these classic tales in Enchanted. However, if you enjoyed the older films for what they were: timeless fairy tales with archetypal characters, battles of good versus evil, and a moral, you will be greatly disappointed with this film.

Enchanted is by no means a traditional fairy tale. It starts off with an animated story of a maiden, Giselle, who is the archetypal Disney princess. She is rescued by Prince Edward from a ravenous troll and the two fall instantly in love. Before the couple is married, the wicked Queen Narissa transports Giselle to the ""real world"", New York city, where she gradually becomes modernized. The way in which she loses her storybook likeness is subtle, but it involves meeting unfriendly types, seeing a couple on the verge of a divorce, and going out on a ""date"" at a pizza place with a divorced lawyer who has taken her under his wing. When Prince Edward finally locates her, instead of being thrilled to go back to her animated, storybook world, she has one request. She asks to be taken to a real-world ball, where her lawyer friend and his fiancee happen to be going as well. At the ball, the evil queen intervenes, giving Giselle a poisoned apple. After taking a bite, she falls into a deep sleep, only to be awakened by true love's first kiss. In what seems like an unbelievably out-of-character twist, Giselle's true love turns out to be the lawyer and not Prince Charming. How she could have been so thoroughly transformed after only a few days in New York city so as to disdain her former life and fianc is a mystery.

Besides having to swallow this strange plot twist, we also witness the lawyer's fiancee, Nancy, falling for the prince. This is after Giselle has heard countless warnings from denizens of the real world against love at first sight. Apparently, Nancy has never heard these warnings, because she falls madly in love after hearing Prince Edward introduce Giselle as ""my heart's true desire"". ""So straightforward. Not a hint of irony"" is her response, and that's all the reason we're given to believe she will leave her life and career and go back to fairyland with Prince Edward. Finally, when all hope of a reasonable ending is lost, we must witness a chipmunk single-handedly vanquishing the evil queen who has transformed herself into a dragon.

Besides these atrocities, there is also much mockery of the traditional fairy tale. The Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines postmodernism as ""a style and concept in the arts characterized by distrust of theories and ideologies and by the drawing of attention to conventions.""  Enchanted fits this description by making a fairy tale character gradually wake up to the conventions of her fantasy world. If you're looking for a dose of reality, you may enjoy this film. But the film's title and animated introduction are misleading. The story is not Enchanted, but Disenchanted. It forces us to see the traditional world of make-believe from the modern, grown-up perspective. It is not a story for children, or those who truly enjoyed the earlier Disney classics.",1254614400,13,3222,4.884826325411335
79870,5,078887148X,Enchanted is a great movie. Disney is able to mock its sickingly sweet fairy tale stories while still having a happy ending and not seeming too hypocritical.,1253318400,,157,4.851851851851852

One day the handsome, brave and rather stupid Prince Edward comes across her as he's engaged in his favorite activity, troll-hunting, and after saving her the two immediately fall in love. But alas, Edward's stepmother, Queen Narissa, has other designs - she doesn't want Edward to ever marry and have a child to take away her throne, and so when Giselle comes to the palace to marry, the Queen tricks her into falling down a deep well, eventually to land in....Times Square. And to leave the world of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty-style 50s Disney animation and enter the world of ""reality."" Kevin Lima's film attempts to walk an almost impossible tightrope - being a film that is both a parody of the traditional fairytale-animated film that has been Disney's bread-and-butter for 70 years, yet also holding onto the fairytale charm and warmth amidst the mockery. Somehow, he comes very close to perfection. No small part of this is due to the absolutely radiant presence of Amy Adams as the real-life Giselle, walking, dancing and (wonderfully) singing her way into the home of divorce lawyer and single father Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) - who of course believes that the princess is everything she in fact turns out to be, while daddy takes a little while longer to accept this mad, magical girl.

Life is further complicated when our handsome prince (James Marsden) appears on the scene as well to rescue Giselle and take her back to Andalasia to wed. By the time he finds her though, Giselle has started to learn that our reality is as interesting and wonderful as - if far less simple than - her cartoon homeland and when the evil queen (Susan Sarandon) finally makes an appearance in the flesh, it's clear that Giselle's human mind has started to dominate her animated heart.

I haven't experienced so much sheer joy and delight in a film in a long time; why oh why did I miss this in the theater? Adams is spectacular, funny and naive but so utterly convincing and ""real"" in her ""unreality"" - she really feels like an alien being through the first 2/3 of the film, so solid and literal and deliberately one-dimensional, and it makes her eventual transformation into a more real woman all the more special. Her songs are mostly wonderful - ""Happy Working Song"" is the best movie song I've heard in a decade at least - and the rest of the cast is more than solid. It's got all the adventure and thrills that the best of the Disney classics had, with loads of references both subtle and overt to such films as Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and especially Snow White, but it never feels particularly derivative or lacking in enthusiasm and verve despite all the cobbling it does from other sources. The soundtrack is mostly terrific, the choreography solid, the animation makes me long for the return of traditional Disney pen-and-ink work. I had a feeling I'd like it, but I didn't expect anything this excellent. If there's a flaw, it's that the ending feels a little too rushed, and some of the CGI just looks a bit weak compared to the traditional animation. But these are small issues, and I suspect I'll like this even more on a second viewing. Just wonderful.

You must've seen that trailer with the heroic Prince in the big city about to burst into song only to be abruptly mowed down by a horde of couldn't care less cyclists. In essence, that scene is a microcosm of the movie. If you like thumbing your nose at hallowed conventions, then let ENCHANTED work its spell on you. If Amy Adams deserved Oscar consideration for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Junebug/dp/B000BYRCQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Junebug</a>&nbsp;(and she did), then she deserves another nod for Giselle, because serious acting did go into this part.

The first fifteen minutes or so of ENCHANTED spool out as your pedestrian, standard Disney animated fable, even hearkening back to 2D animation and smacking of Uncle Walt's head in the clouds sentimentalism. The magical kingdom of Andalasia is introduced, home to the sparkling Giselle, a forest maiden so winsome that all manner of woodland creatures flock to her side. She quickly meets, sings a love duet with, and falls in love with the dashing Prince Edward (all in one day). This doesn't at all suit Edward's step-mother, Queen Narissa a.k.a. the evil witch and the haggish Big Bad of the tale.

Feeling the squeeze on her power base the Queen banishes Giselle to ""a place where there are no happily ever afters."" Giselle emerges from a manhole cover in Times Square, transforming from 2-D animation to full live action flesh and blood, and this is where the story really gets going and where the film shifts from conventional Disney fairy tale into this whimsical yet decidedly snarky thing. Really, what could be more juxtaposed than the embodiment of dreams plonked into a cynical hellhole like New York City?

ENCHANTED is just awesome. A clever script, spot-on skewering, fabulous performances, and even the songs are perfect fits. ""That's How You Know,"" Giselle's bouncy song in Central Park, is pretty darn exhilarating, with Giselle and normally hard-bitten New Yorkers coming together for an elaborate number. Undeniably, that the film comes this strong has to be mostly attributed to Amy Adams, who is simply pitch perfect. The key to what she does here is that her performance isn't couched in irony or self-awareness; the slightest hint of either would've capsized the film. She plays it absolutely straight as an animated princess come to life, all with the wide eyes and the quivery, fluttery voice. And, if you take a good gander, she even captures all those animated princessly mannerisms, that slightly stilted, off-kilter grace. I think it's brilliant stuff.

It's a quelling sensation, the naive Giselle stumbling around in rainy NYC, as she strives to befriend everyone, and everyone in turn either ignores her, disparages her, or steals from her. Luckily, when she plummets off a Palace Casino billboard (she thinks it a real castle), she's caught in the arms of pessimistic divorce lawyer Robert Philip. Robert takes her in and attempts to induct her in the pragmatic ways of everyday reality, one of those easier said than done gigs as Giselle is undeterred in her naivet and optimism. As played by Patrick Dempsey, Robert right away plants this bemused look on his face and maintains it for much of the film. He tells her, sort of accusingly: ""It's like you escaped from a Hallmark card or something."" Naturally, Robert's young daughter Morgan takes to her at first sight.

Further shenanigans arrive in the form of Prince Edward, as fleshly realized by X-MEN's James Marsden (probably because Cary Elwes was getting too long in the tooth). Surprisingly Marsden turns out to be another of the film's strengths, and this is the best and liveliest I've ever seen him. Guy is terrific in his spoofy, exaggerated turn as the square-jawed, dim-witted prince whose attempts at song are interrupted like clockwork (we may never know how ""True Love's Kiss"" ends). It's fun watching him cut a swath in NYC, slaying buses and conversing with the television (which he readily believes to be a magic mirror).

Rounding off the cast, there's that girl who plays the thankless role of Dempsey's fiancee; Timothy Spall (Wormtail in the Harry Potter films) is the Prince's portly manservant Nathaniel who doubles as Queen Narissa's minion (and never mind that he's a bumbler), while Susan Sarandon has fun hamming it up as the witch queen herself (love her ""Hello, worthless."" line, dripping with caustic disdain); and then there's that exasperating CG-rendered chipmunk (which, by the way, rivals the googly-eyed guinea pig in BEDTIME STORIES in sheer annoyance).

In ENCHANTED's tweaking of established Disney fairy tales, I have quite a few favorite scenes, the funniest probably being what happens when Giselle decides to clean Robert's apartment and so sends a trilling call to arms to all the woodland creatures to help with housekeeping, and I still laugh hard and long at the disgusting urban vermin which answers the call. And, of course, there's also Giselle's singing in the park, with Robert's bemused, cynical presence the perfect capper. On a more romantic side Giselle and Robert's memorable waltz recalls Belle and the Beast's sweeping ballroom dance. By the way, I think that Patrick Dempsey does well to play it low key. As such, he provides the perfect bewildered foil for Amy Adams's sweet obliviousness.

Although, ""obliviousness"" isn't quite apt. Giselle, over time, does develop into a more complex character as New York rubs off some on her, although the syrup doesn't entirely run out. When Prince Edward at lasts finds her in New York, he bursts into spontaneous song and it's a significant moment when Giselle fails to join him on cue. And then, before he sweeps her away to Andalasia, she asks that he first take her on a date so that they could get to know one another. Of course, even skewed fairy tales must have a ball, and that's where everything comes together: the swelling romance, the awkwardness of the left out romantic opposites, the face-off with the evil witch and the somewhat jarring CG-rendered big battle, and the tongue-in-cheek assortment of happily ever afters. I have to admit that the flat animation bugged me whenever it reared up, but that's a minor thing, easily overwhelmed by what's good in the film. ENCHANTED ebulliently floats on its charm and wit, the inherent good will behind its elbow digs, and clearly on Amy Adams's disarming interpretation. She won't win an Oscar for this one, but, really, so what? When you can charm rats and roaches and pigeons into cleaning up your crib, that is serious cachet, that is huge mojo. Eff the Oscar.",1246579200,10,6918,5.231740306582506
79877,4,078887148X,"This movie is exactly what it says it is. There are no surprises. In this case, you certainly CAN judge a book, or more appropriately, a movie by it's cover. And with kid's movie, that is usually a good thing.
It's nice to see Disney poking fun at itself. When watching it for the first time, it was my favorite thing about it. (And even one of the ADULT MALES I watched it with was chuckling at the jokes.)
From having the classic animal sidekick, the sappy love at first site, the animals thronging at the princess's feet, the bystanders joining the impromptu singing, and the evil witch and her halfwit henchman, all the classic elements that make a Disney movie are a target. (Think Shrek without any crudeness or bull frog ballons.)
Then after watching it a few more times with the kids once it came out to DVD, the romance began to fade. I found myself unable to dislodge the reggae beat of ""how do you know that you love him..."" from  my head... and out of my mouth! It wouldn't go away! AHH!
I began to detest the movie, and soon everything Enchanted was banned. Just recently I have put the songs back on the kid's playlist on the iPod.
But, it's still a really cute movie despite the ban. The kids (boys and girls) love it, and I'm almost ready to watch it again.

79878,5,078887148X,"This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together, a rarity these days. This is one of the few movies my family saw at the theater at the insistence of ME, Mom, that is. When I saw a preview, I fell in love with the premise: the fairytale world of Disney animation meets New York City meets musical comedy. The blending of sincerity with satire creates a uniquely sweet yet (at least not to me) never cloying tone. How many of us grew up reading (and watching Disney versions of) classic European fairy tales? We all know the drill: someday my prince will come, evil stepmother intervenes, charming forest animals help to save the day, and everyone lives happily ever after. But how do we integrate that fodder from our childhood into our adult lives, or should we even try? Enchanted takes a light-hearted look at this very question. Giselle, an animated beauty from the land of Andalasia, meets Robert, a handsome divorce lawyer with a decidedly un-enchanted view of love. Robert has worked hard to protect his six year old daughter from the ""dangers"" inherent in believing in fictitious happily-ever-afters. So how will he react when a fairytale princess-to-be literally falls into their lives? I enjoyed every aspect of this movie: the charming performances by all the leads, the colorful musical numbers, the humor, and the gentle satire.

79879,5,078887148X,"Director Kevin Lima and writer Bill Kelly present us with this modern fairy tale where animation collides with live action to regale us with the story of Princess-to-Be, Giselle, a cheery beauty of the storybook kingdom of Andalasia, played by russet-haired Amy Adams.
 After an introduction by a well-chosen Julie Andrews, we find Giselle trying to create what turns out to be  a stunningly accurate prototype for her true love, right down to the jacket, but interestingly, having no lips to put on the makeshift mannequin's face.
 Despite the best efforts of the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) to prevent her stepson Edward( James Marsden, with overly dramatic yet comic overtones) from meeting Giselle, whom Narissa fears will take her throne from her, the two do meet when Edward rescues Giselle from a troll(Fred Tatasciore).
  Soon, Giselle's woodland creature friends are helping her prepare for her wedding, led by Pip the Chipmunk (Jeff Bennett, and Kevin Lima), who ironically sounds more like a New Yorker in the animated world than he does later.
 But en route to marry a prince, Narissa, disguised as a hag, diverts Giselle's attention and tosses her into a well with a portal that leads to modern-day New York, which she enters through a manhole.
  The vulnerable naif is a babe in the woods as she navigates her voluminous wedding gown through a crowded subway station. Shortly thereafter, a derelict old man(Edmund Lyndeck) steals her tiara.
  But despite the setback, what was meant for Giselle's harm will ultimately be for her good and for the good of many.
  While riding a taxi home, divorce attorney Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey), who brims with stereotypical New York cynicism, especially after a day dealing with bickering clients, is discussing the virtues  of real-life heroines such as Rosa Parks and Madame Curie with his winsome and precocious daughter, Morgan(Rachel Covey), the latter of whom spots Giselle atop a billboard trying to enter the facade of its castle.
 The 6-year-old, thinking her to be a real Princess, rushes out of the cab, and goes to see the mysterious lady on the billboard. Robert follows her, and Giselle ends up going home with them.
  Morgan believes Giselle's fairy tale explanation as to her arrival there while her father, to say the least, will need a little more convincing.
 The plot thickens when Edward and Pip travel through the portal to find Giselle, later followed by the Queen's henchman, Nathaniel(""Harry Potter's"" Timothy Spall), much to the dismay of the baffled sewer workers.
 While awaiting Edward's arrival, Giselle and an assortment of enchanted creatures clean up the Phillip's apartment, much to Morgan's amazement and Robert's disgust. Giselle's presence also creates difficulties in his relationship with his girlfriend, Linda Tremaine( Broadway singer, Idina Menzel), who finds her and Robert in a compromising position.
 As Edward wreaks havoc trying to find Giselle (watch for an incident before a billboard of the musical, ""Hairspray"", the film version in which Marsden appeared), and Nathaniel has consultations with Narissa in the oddest places, Giselle encounters Robert's clients, Phoebe and Ethan Banks (Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr.) and will ultimately end their feud, and in a musical moment in which she gets a good percentage of New York behind her, she advises Robert on how to win back Linda's affections.
 If she can make it there, she can make it anywhere!
 In due time, Edward does arrive for Giselle, but something in her has changed.
 The Queen arrives in New York for a final confrontation,when encountering each other at a ball, Giselle and Robert dance to a wistful tune with a lot of symbolism, but all ends well, and cynical and snide New Yorkers discover their own happily-ever-afters.
 Witty and upbeat, with well-written dialogue, rafe with fairy tale cliches, and enhanced by Alan Menken's and Stephen Schwartz' score, ""Enchanted"" is nothing less than, well...Enchanting!",1245110400,,3997,5.162790697674419

79892,5,078887148X,"Enchanted is one of those movies - which like ""The Princess Bride"" can be enjoyed by children for the straight-forward story of fairy-tale characters cast into the real world, and by adults for the skewed sensibility and sly wit involved. The animated opening is a picture-perfect send-up of classic Disney movies involving a lovely heroine with a penchant for bursting into song as she is attended by helpful animals, a swashbuckling handsome prince and his wicked Queen stepmother, an adorably cute talking chipmunk, true loves' kiss, et cetera, et cetera.
It's a good-natured and affectionate send-up of the genre, and in the general gloom, doom and heavy-handed-message pictures which came out about the same time over the holiday season, it shown all the more brightly.

Dumped into a magic well by the wicked stepmother, Giselle (Amy Adams) - dressed in a hugely crinolined white dress that looks like Scarlett O'Hara's nightmare - emerges  in the middle  New York, followed closely by her Prince (James Marsden), his not-so-loyal henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall)  and Pip the Chipmunk. Giselle finds refuge with a cynical divorce attorney  Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his naturally princess-adoring small daughter... although her penchant for making clothes out of draperies is at least as unsettling as being able to summon helpful animals to clean up their apartment.  As it is the city, the animals that come and cheerfully set to work scrubbing, straightening and putting to rights are pigeons, rats and a bevy of roaches. About the only bigger show stopper than that is the sequence in Central Park when Giselle sings about knowing the one you love and manages to scoop in a chorus of grooms and their brides, street performers, construction workers into one grand set-piece.

Will she be rescued by her fairy-tale prince, the earnest and endearingly dorky Prince Edward, and find true love with him... or perhaps Robert might turn out to be her real-life prince. Will henchman Nathanial  run out of clever disguises as he conspires to keep Giselle and Edward apart? Will Pip the Chipmunk ever be able to successfully mime a warning to Prince Edward... and finally, how did Susan Saranden manage to keep a straight face as the evil stepmother Queen Nerissa?

 When the first previews for Disney's Enchanted hit the big and small screens it had the potential to be a cinematography disaster. But the story of an animated princess to-be being forced into the not so fairy tale world of New York City by an evil queen in attempts to stop a marriage and save her own position on the throne doesn't disappoint. The lovely and talented Amy Adams plays Gissele and James Marsden plays her one true love. Or so they think. What follows is an epic adventure as the prince enters the present day in search of his love not knowing that his wicked mother and her enamoured henchman are close behind. Aside from Adams and Marsden, the all star cast rounds out with Patrick Dempsey and Susan Sarandon. Disney goes all out in not only creating characters that will enchant you but also in capturing former scenes with a new twist. For instance, aside from all the cameo's by past Disney voices (see if you can figure out who plays Sam, Dempsey's secretary at his firm) an observant viewer will note other quaint references to past classics including: the Italian restaurant from Lady And The Tramp, a thrilling rooftop battle in the style of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, poison apples as only Snow White's witch can conncoct, a glass slipper in Cinderella's size, and a dragon of Sleeping Beauty proportions, to name a few. Even the musical score and lyrics composed by Disney favorite Howard Menken is charming. Enchanted is a beautiful modern take on fairy tales and is a must have for every DVD collection.",1231545600,,2038,6.125874125874126
79904,5,078887148X,"I watched this movie just last night on Netflix, and though I thought it would be cute, I wasn't sure just how good it would be.  This movie really shocked me.  It was practically an old-school-Disney ""Princess"" movie - Brownie Point #1 - and it actually had REAL people in it, including a child (and to me, most kids in movies recently are just obnoxious), yet it wasn't overly mature (as in elements I don't think are appropriate for children) or annoying - Brownie Point #2!  The cast was great, in my opinion, and I loved how the animated characters actually looked like them!  It has music in it - classic ""somehow everyone knows the lyrics and sings along"" music - but that is part of the charm and it even sort of makes fun of itself about the singing.

Over all, a very good family movie!  If you are a person that is looking for a quality kids movie that doesn't have a lot of the garbage that's in a lot of children's films nowadays - then this one is for you!

79915,5,078887148X,"Think of Disney's ""Enchanted"" (2007) as part ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) and part ""Prince Charming"" (2001), with a bit of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) thrown in for good measure. But its real predecessor is Walt Disney's very first production ""Alice's Wonderland"" (1923). Contrary to popular belief Walt's first sustained character was neither Oswald the Rabbit nor Mickey Mouse. It was a six-year old real life girl named Alice. While working for an advertising agency in Kansas City Walt altered a concept from Max and Dave Fleischer's ""Out of the Inkwell"" series and mixed a live actress (Virginia Davis) with animation.

""Enchanted"" is all about the juxtaposition of the real world with the animated world. Animated characters become their real life counterparts, and then turn back into pop-up book scenes. As in ""Prince Charming"", a storybook prince finds himself dealing with modern day Manhattan. But this time he is has come to this strange world voluntarily.

It seems that his stepmother (Susan Sarandon playing a high mileage version of Snow White's Evil Queen) has transported his future bride Giselle (Amy Adams) to the real world. Adams is quite simply amazing in this role. She has no trouble selling her character's wide-eyed innocence (this is literally true-just watch her eyes). Giselle works her magic on cynical divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his six- year-old daughter. Although the film has no weak scenes I found myself trying to hurry along the portions that did not feature Adams.

There are some relatively subtle sight gags; watch for the difficulties Giselle has maneuvering her huge Princess gown around the real world. Also watch for Adams' two musical numbers, ""Happy Working Song"" and ""That's How You Know"". These are absolutely priceless and compare favorably with the cinema's best musical moments.

""Enchanted"" might have this decade's widest target audience as it has almost universal appeal. My only criticism is that the effects loaded climatic scene is not nearly as entertaining as the sequences that precede it.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1228348800,,2131,5.183139534883721
79916,5,078887148X,"This is a truly delightful love story that parodies Disney's Cinderella storyline.  You have the capability to play through the entire movie or to select from 20 individual scene selections.  There are also bonus features such as deleted scenes, bloopers, behind-the-scenes shots, and a Pip adventure sub-story.

The presentation begins, as a storybook opens, with cartoon characters.  It changes quickly to humans.  Evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) does not want her stepson to marry because she is afraid his marriage would mean the loss of her throne.  Prince Edward is riding his beautiful white horse ""Destiny"" through the woods.  His servant Nathaniel is with him.  He is thinking about true love's kiss while he is out in the woods chasing trolls.  Simultaneously, Giselle is in a cottage in the woods, daydreaming of true love's kiss and her prince.  Edward hears Giselle singing from afar and becomes instantly enamoured. *sigh* He rescues Giselle as she falls from a tree after being chased up the tree by a mean troll (big troll too).  They fall in love immediately and plan to marry the next day (without a pre-nup), but the Queen will have none of that!

On Giselle's wedding day, the Queen, disguised as an old hag, pushes Giselle into a magic well and Giselle comes out on the other side in Times Square, Manhattan, NYC.  This sure ain't nuthin like Andalasia and she is totally out of her comfort zone.  She is alone, afraid, and looking everywhere for Prince Edward, not realizing what has just happened to her.  Giselle (Amy Adams) seems likie a real fruitcake when Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan spot her.  To Morgan, Giselle is right out of a fairytale.  To Robert, Giselle is a little wierd, but is so helpless.  (Anyway, it is New York, so colorful is not that wierd :-)\

At Morgan's urging, Robert takes Giselle out of the rain and into his apartment just to dry off.  Well wouldn't you know it--Giselle zonks out on the couch and the fun begins.  Across the storyline side of town, Prince Edward jumps into the magic well looking for his Giselle.  Not-so-nice Queen Narissa enlists the assistance of Nathaniel by hinting she will make him king and be his woman if he just gives Giselle an itty bitty poison apple.  By the way, Robert the rescuer has a fiancee named Nancy, who just does not relish sharing him with Giselle.  And the whole time, there is an adorable chipmunk from the Royal Court running around Manhattan trying to help Edward and Giselle get back together, while speaking Chipmunkese.

This is a great good vs. evil, feel-good story, a modern-day Cinderella.  It is great viewing for the whole family.  The music is great and so is the CGI (computer-graphic imaging).  Giselle has a lovely voice, the kind that Disney typically uses for its movies.  When you're all done watching the movie, watching the backstage scenes really gives you an appreciation of the work that went into this delightful movie.

79917,5,078887148X,"I was told that this movie made fun of every other Disney movie ever made, so when I saw it, I expected to just see it once, for laughs.  But it turned out to be a sheer delight to watch and is quickly becoming one of my favorite Disney movies.

The movie has great Disney-classic musical sequences mixed with Broadway dancing.  Beautiful Amy Adams, the actress who plays Giselle, displays amazing acting and singing talent.  Her expressive face was perfect for the part.  Patrick Dempsey did a really good job portraying the cynical, but protective single father.

The only thing I would have excluded from this movie was the scene with Narissa at the end.  It was unnecessary, since the rest of the story was wrapped up, but I think perhaps that scene is where people get the idea that it ""makes fun"" of all the other Disney movies.  I still didn't find it sarcastic or satirical toward Disney--just unnecessary.

If you watch the movie and love the musical sequences as much as I did, I recommend you watch the Bonus Feature ""Fantasy Comes to Life,"" where they show the some behind-the-scenes footage of three of the major songs.

79922,3,078887148X,"Amy Adams stars as Giselle, a fairy tale princess banished by wicked, power-hungry Narissa, her mother-in-law to be (Susan Sarandon), from Andalasia, her idyllic cartoon-land to the live action, hardened streets of New York City. Patrick Dempsey plays Robert, a single-parent and divorce lawyer who becomes Giselle's unlikely rescuer and real life Prince Charming. Needless to say, Giselle eventually wins everyone over--including of course Dempsey's cynical character.  With her own Prince Edward (James Mardsen) and an evil minion of Narissa's in hot pursuit, Giselle gradually adapts to her new world, while maintaining a storybook innocence and cheerful affect that's straight out of Neverland.

As a whole, this comedy probably looked better on paper than it comes across on film.  While the idea of ""Enchanted"" is a charming twist on the musical and fairytale genres that combines elements of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Snow White,"" or ""Peter Pan,"" the film itself is only mildly amusing.  True, there are inspired bits such as the running gag of Giselle's fairytale princess-speak and Prince Edward's confrontation with a gruff city bus driver, as well as his later attempt to break into song just before being trampled in the streets of Central Park. Most adults, however, may find ""Enchanted"" somewhat underwhelming, although it is entirely appropriate for a seven- or eight-year old. The actors gamely play their parts, the direction is seamless and the production values high, but ""Enchanted"" isn't the slightest bit hip or knowing. For all its provocative NYC environs, this movie fails to come alive in the way of a recent comedy such as ""Juno.""

Whoever at Disney thought cockroaches helping the princess clean the house was a good idea, should be committed to a mental-institution. The writers having the characters make poses from past Disney fairy-tales, shows the writers unfocused from writing a better story.

The actress playing Giselle the princess does an excellent job portraying fairy-tale innocence. The writers should have had the innocent fairy-tale characters have heroic character and heroic acts that wow us. Instead, they portray the prince as a dummy. I did not like the idea of one guy stealing the other guy's girl.

Worth watching for some good ideas and some good scenes, but frustrating for lack of purity. This movie was made by committee with some smart people starting great ideas and some other weird people spoiling them.",1224547200,,961,5.315789473684211

It pretends to put the fairy tale world upside down and teach a couple of things about ""true love"", but instead ends up reaffirming the fairy tale concepts, but without the class and elegance of the original. In fact, bad taste is all over the place: Almost-nudity, a joke involving faeces, talk about boys wanting ""only one thing"", easy jokes copied from Shrek and ""Splash"", a nauseating musical number in Central Park...

Then I really liked it, and I ordered a copy for our DVD library.  When I was watching it again today,  I realized that I truly love this movie, and I needed to write a review of it.  It's only after repeated viewings that I have finally recognized genius in this film.  Disney has pulled out all the stops to make a hilarious live-action parody of its own invented genre of animated fairy-tale romance.  I bet I have watched this movie ten times now, and I find something new every viewing.

Amy Adams is an amazing actress.

In Enchanted, she really makes you believe that she is the animated character of Giselle, come to life.  Her dippy hand gestures and her wide-eyed straight delivery of truly goofy lines are superb.  But what makes the performance even more amazing is the gradual transformation of Giselle from cartoonish to human before our very eyes.  Adams never loses her Disney-princess innocence, but she becomes fully three-dimensional in her movements and her line readings as the film moves to a satisfying happily-ever-after for the stars.  It's an inspired performance.

The other actors are equally good.  Patrick Dempsey is now a confirmed hunky leading man -- I still recall him so clearly as a geek in his early teenage movies.  James Marsden is also sigh-worthy.  And Susan Sarandon as the Evil Stepmother -- what can I say?  The woman is ageless, gorgeous, and can play anything.

And the songs?  Marvelous.  When I took my kids to New York this past May, we spent half a day in Central Park, our Ipods plugged in, swooping around and singing out advice on ""How does she know you love her?  How does she know you care?"" while we checked out all the places where they filmed the scenes from that number.  (Yes, if you were in the park that Tuesday, that was us -- and no, we hadn't been drinking.)

It is a good Disney film.  Putting the live action flip into a tried & true fairy tale Disney formula with the young woman to be rescued from the prince & living happily ever after.

I was glad Susan got the part of the Queen.  She did a good job.  BUT, HER ROLE WAS TOO SMALL.  We done see her until the end of the film & before that just her voice in a few scenes.  I would have loved to have seen her take off with the role.

Let's see.  Dempsey got the role because of his hit ABC show.  I found his role & performance boring. Went no where.

The film SHOULD have won Oscars for the music.  Shame it did not with Oscar winner Alan Menken at work again.  Sure beats that ""you've heard it once you've ever one of Randy Newman's music for the Disney/Pixar films"".

Amy Adams did an OK job as Giselle.  Just, her performance was just missing 1 little spark in my opinion.

79934,4,078887148X,"What a hoot! Starring Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, and Susan Sarandon, this modern take on the traditional fairy tale is a fun romp through all of Disney's previous stories.

Giselle (Adams), in her animated world of Andalasia, has the good fortune to meet her handsome Prince Edward (Marsden). The two experience love at first sight. With plans to marry the following day, Giselle heads to the castle in an elaborate wedding gown. Little does she know that jealous Queen Narissa (Sarandon, playing Edward's evil stepmother) and her henchman (Timothy Spall, in a fabulous comic turn) are plotting to prevent the wedding, enabling Narissa to remain queen indefinitely.

As Giselle arrives at the castle, Narissa pushes her down into a ""wishing well,"" sending the beautiful would-be princess to a place where ""there ARE no happy ever afters."" This place? Modern-day New York City. After wandering aimlessly for a while, Giselle meets world-weary divorce lawyer Robert (Dempsey) and his six-year-old daughter. (Robert himself is a divorcee, though he has plans to propose to his current girldfriend.)

Cheerily awaiting Edward to come rescue her, Giselle calls her animal ""friends"" to help tidy up Robert's messy apartment. (In New York, that means a rather disgusting cadre of rats, pigeons, and cockroaches show up to dust off his kitchen countertops with their tails. Yuck.) She then proceeds to cut up Robert's drapes to craft inventive outfits for herself. Lastly, she wanders into a discussion between one of Robert's clients and her soon-to-be-ex-husband, causing more trouble for Robert. Robert is, by turns, infuriated and charmed.

Once Prince Edward, back in the mythical land of Andalasia, discovers what has happened to his bride-to-be, he blunders into New York himself to do his princely duty. From then on, the desires of each character lead us to a satisfying (but thoroughly over-the-top) conclusion.

What I find interesting about this movie is that it's a conversation between an optimistic fairy tale and the jaded modern world. Does true love exist? What about love at first sight? When so many traditional fantasies have been debunked, how do we continue to believe in ""happily ever after?"" Or believe in love at all?

Adams provides a great rendition of Giselle, a fairytale princess come to life. More impressive, though, are the moments in which Giselle realizes that she might not be such a good fit back in Andalasia now that she's had a taste of the ""real world."" Prince Edward is hilariously written (without malice) as a vapid, vacant, self-absorbed prince. Sarandon gloriously chews the scenery, and Dempsey (as always) provides the best-looking brokenhearted man I've ever had the pleasure of watching on screen.

I personally thought the ending fell apart a bit. It was a little too much, and the statements that Disney was going for were a little too blatant. However, I understand that this is a family movie, and some of those choices were designed to benefit younger viewers. At any rate, I don't think the ending detracted too mightily from the preceding action, which I heartily enjoyed.

I thought this movie was a great send-up of the fairytale tradition, and I applaud Disney for being big enough to wink at its own narrative history. What a fun film!",1220140800,,3305,5.096118299445472

79936,4,078887148X,"Enchanted starring Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey is a cute Disney flick for all ages. James Marsden and Susan Sarandon also star and steal the show. Adams's performance is a bit annoying but her angelic voice and adorable charisma is the perfect recipe to play a sweet, doe-eyed princess. Dempsey is pretty good in this as well, he's more than McDreamy guys! This movie is part animation and live action, I like the songs and ending. Give this charming fairytale a chance, enjoy!",1219795200,,479,4.783132530120482
79937,5,078887148X,"This movie is pure magic - a true gift to all movie viewers of all ages.  In this day and age it is so important to have a movie that just makes you feel good and manages to give you a natural high.  This movie is so well crafted.  The story is very original - cartoon characters coming to life - but it could have been silly.  Instead, it is handled by only the most talented at all levels from director to A++++ actors to bring pure art together.

Amy Adams as the princess is a revelation.  She inhabits this character with all she has.  The princess becomes very real and you experience all the wonders of the world with her.  Her comedic timing is impeccable and her singing is glorious.  Adding Patrick Dempsey as her real life Prince Charming was ingenious casting.  It is so great to see him away from Grey's Anatomy.  He is a class act and truly personifies all that is good and caring in this world.  He also manages to make his character believable and not a caricature.

When the movie bursts into song your heart will sing.  It is amazing.  The entire package of this film from beginning to end is pure magic and a journey for people of all ages to take.  Show it to your kids so they can see that positive, happy feelings are possible.  And for me, being 47, I recommend it to all adults.  It will make you see how we all become a little jaded in life and it reminds us that the world can be magic and love is the greatest gift of all.  True love's first kiss.

This movie will become a Disney classic.  It ranks up there wih the best of them like Mary Poppins.  It is honestly one of the best and most feel good movies I have ever seen.

Kudos to ereryone involved and highly recommended.",1219795200,2,1703,4.204334365325077

79939,2,078887148X,"I wanted to like this movie.  I like fairy tales and happily every after.  And it had a few good moments, but overall this movie grated on my nerves.  Watching it made me tense and edgy for reasons I can't quite explain.  The chipmunk, of course, was the highlight of the movie - and that's saying quite a bit.

There were moments of dialogue where I did like the characters, but I spent most of the movie cringing - especially when it came to the prince.  I just couldn't handle his character - it was so very, very bad.  And it wasn't so much the acting (though that was over-the-top, perhaps by design) but the script and the costumes and everything.  And perhaps he was supposed to be annoying.  The wicked witch was better in person than she was animated, but still felt like a two-dimensional character.  Some of the supporting cast were better (the little girl, for one) but it simply didn't make up for what felt like a real lack of chemistry between most of the characters.

And even though I expected the story to be somewhat predictable, there were zero twists and turns to liven it up.  Absolutely nothing original or interesting once you got past the 'falling into the real world' bit (which, admittedly, was big, but you need something near the finale - besides a scene that reeks of political correctness).

For a really good fairy tale movie, check out The Princess Bride and give this one a miss.",1219190400,,1413,4.515748031496063
79940,4,078887148X,"A very good romantic comedy, Enchanted, brings to the screen the story of a soon-to-be-wed cartoon princess who magically gets sent to NYC by her betrothed's evil stepmother. Although the dashing prince sets forth to rescue his beloved, things get a bit complicated when the princess falls for an unsuspecting New Yorker about to ask his girlfriend in marriage...
Enchanted is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
Amy Adams (who is GORGEOUS!), Patrick Dempsey, Timothy Spall (from the Harry Potter movies!), James Marsden, Susan Sarandon, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face. It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good!
Though not a masterpiece, Enchanted is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1219104000,2,1188,5.097435897435897
79941,4,078887148X,"This is a wonderful family movie because kids love it (mine range from 3-11 and all enjoy it) and there is plenty for grown-ups to laugh at also.

79942,2,078887148X,"In Enchanted, Disney is content with shoveling us the same old s*** and calling it sugar.

I was hoping this would be a biting satire of the Mouse House's past fables but instead they played it safe and only increased their self-awareness: ""Yes we know how silly the musical numbers were in those old cartoons, so let's ratchet up the camp level a little for this film!"" Except for a bizarrely crude cleaning-song parody involving NYC's vermin (amusing in concept and maybe initially but like all the movie's good parts, the fun factor was quick and fleeting), I can't think of anything that makes this different from all the other cookie-cutter sludge the company churns out every year.

Disney really made it seem like they were going to town on all the soggy cliches clogging up their extensive family-friendly output but it's not like I was expecting this to star Sarah Silverman (though that would have been genius). Instead we get James Marsden beginning to belt an over-the-top ""I've been dreaming of..."" and then getting hit by a group of bicyclists in Central Park. That's about it.

All the scenes with McDreamy were snooze-worthy and highlighted the main problem of Enchanted: its tone. The real world scenes weren't crazy enough... in fact, they tried to act like this was reality and not, you know... a f***ing DISNEY production. No police or post-9/11 military personel patrolling the city at all? Not a single person thinks about sending Amy Adams to a psychiatric ward (though that might have been too darkly comedic)? It's either a total fantasy or not. You can't try to have it both ways.

In the end it's another dumbed-down kid flick. There are much worse injustices in this world and if you're satisfied with that then by all means, watch it with the whole Sunday School class.",1217894400,2,1798,4.809061488673139

79946,5,078887148X,Having three little girls that believe they are all princesses I have to endure many Disney movies. Enchanted is different from many other Disney movies in that it kind of makes fun of the basic FairyTale formula Disney has relied upon for years. As an adult male with the children I found the movie funny and I laughed in places my kids did not get. For having to sit through this on a long drive it was pretty good. Despite not having any car chases or fiery explosions I still liked it.,1215993600,2,489,4.326086956521739

79948,4,078887148X,"Well, this particular movie has been on my must-see list for absolutely weeks.  I've heard lots about how it turns the whole fairy tale story onto its head in a family fun way and wanted to see for myself.
To recap, Giselle lives in Andalasia, a fairy-tale cartoon land.  When an ogre comes to eat her, Prince Edward rushes to her rescue.  Immediately, the two fall in love and go off to marry.
Enter wicked witch/step-mother.  She doesn't want to lose her reign, so she tosses Giselle down a waterfall to land in New York.  There, Giselle meets up with Robert, a divorced lawyer, and his young daughter and completely changes their lives (and they also change Giselle a little bit too...).
The movie starts out really corny...love at first sight, sappy songs, etc. but this is all to contrast it with the New York parts latter on (so if it's annoying, just hold on, it gets better).
Amy Adams absolutely shines as Giselle.  She sings so beautifully (the songs are adorable and catchy, particularly ""The Working Song"" and ""How do you know?"") and is charming.  McDreamy as Robert is perfect as the charming, skeptical divorcee.  I adored Susan Sarandon as the wicked queen (perfect casting, absolutely perfect).
The plot is crisp and fluid.  The story really takes the typical ""love at first sight"" concept and turns it on its heels in a delightful way.
If there are any annoying parts there are two primary ones.  The first is that Susan Sarandon is not in enough of the film (mostly appearing as a cartoon figure in a bowl of soup or a glass of water).  The second is more critical.

SPOILERS!  If you don't want the ending ruined, stop here and go to the end!

START: The theme of the movie at the beginning seems to be you can't fall in love with someone you hardly know.  Robert has been dating Nancy (Idina Menzel) for five years after all and is finally thinking of proposing to her.  He in fact tells Giselle that love is something that takes years to work at and includes dating to get to know someone.  But at the end of the film, Nancy goes back to Andalasia with Prince Edward, whom she has known all of one day, and Giselle goes with Robert, whom she has known barely a week.  This conclusion seems to contradict in every aspect the theme so carefully set up at the beginning.  So, are they being satirical, that true love takes time to cultivate, or are they reinforcing the idea, that true love can appear in a moment?  END

I adored the film until the end.  The conclusion really ruined the movie for me.  However, the excellent casting, beautiful songs, and really good story at the beginning could not be completely erased.  Definitely fun for everyone.

79950,5,078887148X,"I am really glad I saw this movie, it has all the components of a great fairy tale adventure movie. The characters are from another world but end up in New York City where they are constantly suprised by the difference between our world and the fantasy world they come from, making for great comedy. Susan Sarandon plays the evil witch, and though her performance is excellent, it's strange because in real life Susan Sarandon is known as a selfless person who stands up for people who can't stand up for themselves, she has dedicated herself to so many causes, that seeing her as the villian is difficult to do, though her acting in the movie is spectacularly entertaining. The movie is also a musical and the princess character frequently breaks into song- and these are wonderful moments in the film. Another strong point of the film is that, unlike many fairy tale films, this one does actually have unexpected plot twists in it. It's not a formulaic movie like some might expect from fairy tales. Most important of all, the movie has a happy ending. So of course, great acting, great singing, great story, all of these are reasons to see the movie.",1215302400,,1153,4.6568627450980395

Losing power was actually a blessing in disguise, because it gave my whole family (plus Grandparents) the opportunity to fire up the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Generator/dp/B0009VF62C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Generator</a>, and gather around the only TV in the house that would go on with the only DVD in the house that no one except my daughter had seen...Enchanted.

What a pleasant surprise! Enchanted was great. It might even be one of my favorite, all-time Disney movies. It's about an animated world's evil witch-queen that casts a Snow-White-esque character into real world NYC in order to keep The Prince from marrying her. Sounds silly, I know, but it's not the story that makes this movie, it's how the actors just nailed their roles...especially Amy Adams as Giselle. She took every silly, only-a-Disney-Princess-character-acts-like-this nuance and brought it to life.

Patrick Dempsey, a big-time divorce lawyer, and his young daughter find Giselle, and the rest is a highly entertaining, heart warming story with some laugh out loud moments that I've not experienced in many movies these days.

79963,5,078887148X,"Not since the brilliant Howard Ashman and 'Aladdin' has Disney managed to create a perfect movie. Fifteen years later Ashman's partner Alan Menken has found a new lyricist equal to the task, in Stephen Schwartz. This wonderful movie is guaranteed to delight children, and there's plenty for adults as well. Everyone will respond to 'Happy Working Song', a hilarious and magical reworking of 'A Spoonful of Sugar', and also 'That's How You Know', the first fully-successful ensemble performance since, perhaps, 'Sound of Music'.
For me, the greatest thing about all great Disneys is the way they challenge people to think about moral questions, without ever being preachy. This film is firmly in that tradition. It focuses on the question of cynicism, plausibly placing a completely uncynical person into the cynical, worldly world of New York City. Her journey is from a girlish perception of love to a womanly appreciation including sexual attraction, but she never moves an inch in terms of cynicism, despite everything swirling around her. Rather, hers is the victory as, one after the other, the various people she meets get drawn towards her world-view.
The film explores a second theme, having a lot of fun with the idea of people of different paradigms coming together. The film explores this in terms of inclusiveness and understanding, even reaching across sexual stereotypes in the big ensemble number (starting with the idea of old people falling in love, and taking it from there).
Great entertainment for all. I hope that more adults look beyond prejudice and give this film the chance it deserves, to delight and enlighten. It bears many repeated viewings.",1212883200,7,1670,5.143382352941177
79964,4,078887148X,"You have to think that Disney realized that they were setting the bar pretty high for themselves, when they decided to parody themselves.  In an age of Scary Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc. perhaps it was the wisest thing to do, before the image they have built up for years was reduced to toilet humor and fart jokes.

Being a Disney movie their riffing on themselves while enjoyable, was still a little too syrupy sweet.

Adams is wonderful as Giselle, and while not an Academy Award winning performance, still one that had me believing in her doe-eyed innocence and sincerity. One never knew that by the end a stereotypical Disney princess could turn out to be so sexy.

If you are a long time Disney fan, you'll enjoy picking out the parallel scenes to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, etc.

79965,5,078887148X,"This may be one of the best Disney films I have seen in a long time.

In the animated section, it brings you back to the delightful old-style of Disney animation, with just a touch of modern design. Giselle is sweet and delightful as any Disney princess -- but perhaps not as harsh as the modern day cartoon princess.

The fairy tale seems to come to a quick conclusion when she meets her Prince just moments into the film -- but no happy ending can happen that quickly!

Cue the evil stepmother/queen who wants to rule Andalasia forever! Susan Sarandon does a marvelous job in this role -- both as the voice and in her live-action role. If she doesn't remind you of Maleficent, you need to watch Sleeping Beauty again!

Long time fans of Disney films will delight in the numerous references to older films. Just when you think you've seen them all, another one pops out.

Robert's receptionist? That's Jodi Benson - the voice of the Little Mermaid! She's not the only voice talent who shows up either, so keep a careful watch.

The only disappointment was that I'd read Idina Menzel (Nancy) had a singing part. It wasn't in the film, it wasn't in the extras, and it wasn't on the soundrack. Rumors say there may be an Enchanted sequel -- if it comes to fruition, hope for a nifty plot and that Nancy sings!

I saw this film twice in the theatre, and adults and children were simply enthralled. Even the youngest children (under 5) were silent except in the funny bits where they laughed delightedly.

""Enchanted"" is a fish-out-of-water tale that is also an homage to ""Snow White,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Mary Poppins,"" and countless other Disney classics that have come before it.  Here, a fairy tale princess (Amy Adams) crosses over from the world of animation to the  world of live-action, without losing her cheery disposition and otherworldly charm in the process.

On the day she is to be wed to her long-awaited Prince Charming, the beautiful Giselle is tossed out of the storybook kingdom of Analasia by a jealous evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who has no intention of letting some pretty little upstart usurp her throne.  When Giselle finally finishes falling, she lands smack dab in the middle of a live-action Manhattan that is only a tad less immaculate and a shade less colorful than the cel-animated world she calls home.  The plucky heroine is both dazzled and a bit confused by this strange looking world where the people don't seem quite as friendly or optimistic about life as the inhabitants of Analasia.  Giselle is befriended by an unromantic, decidedly commitment-phobic divorce attorney (Patrick Dempsey) who doesn't know quite what to make of this odd, undoubtedly deranged creature who, when she isn't inspiring critters to help her tidy up the apartment or breaking out into full-throated, spontaneous song, is extolling the virtues of true love and declaring her undying faith in happily-ever-after endings.

Most of the fun of ""Enchanted"" lies in watching this almost impossibly cheerful, utterly imperturbable former cartoon character going up against the harsh realities of the real world (as harsh as the ""real world"" in any Disney film can be, that is), yet maintaining her sunny disposition throughout.  The filmmakers have devised some spot-on parodies of the typical Disney musical number, replete with high-pitched warbling,  a chorus of singing animals, and lyrics that reflect an unquenchable conviction that all is for the best  in this best of all possible worlds.  At times, the idea of the film is better than its execution, opting, as it often does, for silliness and strained slapstick over sophistication and wit.  And sometimes, even the concept itself falls flat, as when we are left to ponder whether these creatures, with their weird behavior and exotic garb, would really be all that out of place in Times Square.  And, regrettably, the filmmakers couldn't resist throwing an utterly superfluous, CGI-generated dragon into the mix at the end.

Yet, for the most part, the movie is clever, bright and beguiling, and boasts a wonderfully ditzy performance by the lovely Miss Adams that brings the whole sugarcoated confection to life.  The material many be stretched a bit beyond its breaking point, but ""Enchanted"" casts a spell over its audience anyway.",1211328000,20,2804,5.184035476718403

Although I wasn't totally let down, I was not entirely impressed when I watched it.  It was a cute movie for the 8-12 year old girl range, but a little lacking for adults.",1211068800,,277,4.2075471698113205
79977,3,078887148X,"Enchanted is a fun family film, no doubt. Not brilliant, but fun and cute.
 If I were to say one thing to anyone who has yet to screen it, I would suggest that it is not necessarily a movie for boys. Some boys will surely fall in love with it, especially those who have been raised on Disney classics. But any boy who is not into this sort of thing is going to be utterly bored, and ready to snooze as all the ballgowns and cutesy animals and musical numbers go by.

I enjoyed the film, mostly because it's such a spoof of Disney fairy tales. But I cannot understand why they waited so very long to bring the evil queen into the real world; when Susan Sarandon finally shows up as a live action character, the film is nearly over. Oh, well.
I was very impressed by Rick Baker's makeup on Susan Sarandon as the hag/crone. Remarkable. It does not even look like her, but it is her. I haven't been so taken aback by fantasy makeup since Sigourney Weaver played Snow White's wicked stepmother in Snow White: A Tale of Terror (a very dark version of the story). Another fantastic hag makeup job in that film too.

All the in-jokes here are cute, and the songs aren't bad at all.  You know which man the maiden is going to end up with very quickly.
I only had a few minor issues watching this, such as why the writers felt that cockroaches and a swarm of flies were needed to help clean up the apartment. Not something I would've considered.

Bottom line here-- if you're a fan of classic Disney animation, this is a fun evening's entertainment. And it looks like Disney will continue its fairy tale tradition because their future animation projects involve princesses (The Princess and the Frog, and Rapunzel).",1211068800,5,1705,4.434504792332269
79978,3,078887148X,"Little girls today don't believe in fairytales the way they did even a decade ago: they see much more commonly now that the women in their own lives closer resemble the women from Lipstick Jungle--struggling to balance work, family, friends, and romance--rather than the princesses staring out their castle windows, dreaming of the prince who will come save them from a life of gold-collar imprisonment.  Nothing seems like it could ever be as picture-perfect as those brightly colored cels we remember so well from our childhood, but Director Kevin Lima tries his hardest with Enchanted, creating one part traditional fairytale (for the kids) and one part slightly sardonic chick flick (for the moms and big sisters).  For both, though, Enchanted incorporates modern-day feminist theory to challenge traditional roles for princesses and real world women alike.

Living in the fictional storybook fairyland of Andalasia, Enchanted opens with Gisele (Amy Adams) throwing open her cottage window and singing alongside the birds and other woodland critters about finding her ""true love's kiss""... all without an ounce of cynicsm or snark in her tone.  Moments later, she is rescued Prince Charming (Edward, James Marsden) and is all set to marry him until his mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) concocts a plan to send Gisele plummeting down a dark well to ""a place where there is no happily ever after,"" read: New York City.  While that is an example of one of the jokes the adult audience chuckled at but probably soared over the younger counterpart's heads, Lima's Disney-fied version of New York was not nearly gritty enough to hold up to such a label.  The color palette is as bright, pristine, and chipper as Gisele herself, even in human form, where Adams' long, wavy hair and big bright eyes all scream cartoonish innocence-- in the daintiest way possible, of course.  Lima creates a fantasy even in a supposed reality, especially upon meeting Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a New York lawyer so surprisingly unjaded, he allows this strange and seemingly troubled young woman into his home, even with his young daughter (Rachel Covey) sleeping in the next room.  It is hard not to get lost in the magical fantasy Enchanted offers as an escape from the jaded tedium of our real world.

Enchanted is cute film that elicits quite a few chuckles, but it does bite off a little more of the apple than it can chew (to use one of the many allegorical references to past fairytales the film employs) when it tries to marry (pun intended) the characters from the two worlds.  Suddenly Lima seems to rely on the pure hope that his core demographic will be too young to question his fuzzy logic of how some characters mature and evolve (such as Gisele learning what real dating is and questioning what she wants for her life) and others do exactly the opposite, ultimately throwing away everything they have ever worked for (like the underused Idina Menzel's Nancy), and muddling the attempt at the female empowerment message.

Years ago, true love would have been enough to defeat the Queen's nefarious plans, but today's audiences tend to look for additional twists as they near the end of a film.  Lima delivered on such expectations with a rushed remembrance of what makes the Disney villains so classic: they need to scare the children to the point of closing their eyes in their movie theatre seats.  Enchanted had been so focused on Gisele's journey and the romantic-comedy aspect of the story, that Narissa only popped up occasionally, in makeshift mirror reflections, and in order to suddenly blow her persona up to larger-than-life status, he did so quite literally with a CGI creature that unfortunately was much lamer than what today's youth is used to seeing.  It was an admirable attempt, but if anyone closed their eyes at that sight, it was out of embarrassment.

Some may remember the very early trailer for Enchanted that played before Disney's summer blockbuster Pirate's of the Caribbean: At World's End: it featured a brief but more sinister glimpse of Menzel's Nancy, as if alluding to a subplot and subsequent underlying message that if Robert actually went through with the marriage, she, too, would turn into an Evil Stepmother.  When Enchanted was released theatrically in November 2007, though, Menzel's role seemed considerably scaled down, as she appeared as barely a supporting player--wasting her classic theatre talent in a musical that doesn't even allow her to sing.  The hope was that the DVD would offer deleted scenes that showcased Menzel's powerhouse vocals... but it looks like in order to get any of (if they even do exist), we'll have to wait for the obligatory Two-Disc Collector's Edition that Disney releases from their fictional vaults to mark their films' anniversaries.

In fact, the studio must be waiting for an anniversary edition to give us the goods because this release meagerly offers six deleted scenes, introduced by Lima, including an extended opening done in storyboard form because the idea was scrapped long before they started animating.  ""Fantasy Comes to Life"" is your standard ""Making Of"" for the musical numbers (namely ""Happy Working Song,"" That's How You Know,"" and ""A Blast At The Ball"") and what went into putting them together.  The most interesting there is of course ""Happy Working Song,"" which delves into which parts of the number was done with live animals (and how) and which were purely CGI.  There is also a quick blooper reel, the ""Ever Ever After"" music video, and an interactive game featuring Andalasia (and subsequently New York)'s unofficial mascot Pip.  The game is a little sophomoric even for Enchanted's young fans, considering the movie asks for a savvier, slightly more mature audience.  If you buy the Blu-Ray version, though, there is an extra bonus featurette that looks at the film's subtle (and some not-so) references to past Disney films, including cameos by the actresses behind Ariel, Belle, and Pocohontas.

Enchanted is one of those movies that will be enjoyed by both kids and adults-- perhaps on different levels and for different reasons-- but the movie really seems to be made for the generation that grew up with such classic Disney fairytales as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast--a generation that is now decades more mature and therefore able to poke fun at the very idealistic, very nave beliefs of their childhood... all while still managing to hold onto a little bit of those optimistic hopes.",1210982400,4,6509,5.01669758812616
79979,4,078887148X,"Since Shrek, numerous studios have produced movies that overtly combined themes from classic Disney cartoons.  So it was only time before Disney joined in; the result being this combination cartoon - live action flick titled ""Enchanted"".  The story is simple enough, but the execution was actually very impressive.  As a Disney movie, there is singing, and it was actually quite good.  The comedy was original enough, and appropriate for both adults and children.  The casting was also good, with Susan Sarandon being the perfect pick as the wicked step-mother.  I could only find two drawbacks.  First, like just about every other Disney classic, all the main characters are white.  Second, this movie bears an eerie resemblance to Hallmark's TV miniseries, ""The Tenth Kingdom"".  Both movies alternate between a magical land and New York City, and both movies star a single dad raising a daughter.  But overall, not bad, and one of the better Hollywood productions that combined live-action and cartoon into one story.",1210896000,,1019,5.196319018404908

I waited for the DVD release of Enchanted and sat down with high expectations. I have seen what the animators can do. But the transition to real-time from animation left me cold. Although the actors did a fine job the magic of the story didn't come across as it does in the animation. Take for example the fact that Giselle, with merely a melodious call of her voice, summons the sweet, docile, furry woodland creatures to help her clean house in the animated portion. Imagine seeing her do that in the real NYC and finding the call being answered by packs of sewer rats, flocks of pigeons and swarms of roaches. Not magical in any way. I was ready to put in a call to an exterminator!

Not really for children who aren't used to seeing the seamier side of life.

I did like two parts of this movie: the portion where the evil queen turns into a dragon (I really like dragons) and the conclusion where the viewer see the words The End.

79990,5,078887148X,"Ingeniously incorporating a mix of memorable elements from earlier fantasy classics, including The Wizard of Oz, Men in Tights, King Kong, and their own fairy tale repertoire, the Disney folks, whose products are often annoying, have turned up a winner. Filmed like a musical, Enchanted is a delightful, sometimes fanciful , sometimes realistic tale about make believe characters who wind up in NYC because of the curse of an evil queen. Amy Adams and James Marsden are perfectly cast as the innocent, ingenuous maiden and prince, and Susan Sarandon overacts deliciously as the evil queen. Patrick Dempsey provides just the right contrast in his role as wordly, disappointed-in-love divorce lawyer, and, as his daughter, little Rachel Covey hits just the right note, neither too precocious nor too sweet. The hundreds of animals are right off the pages of Cinderella, even the bees, the pigeons, and the rats. The reactions of the New Yorkers who encounter the strange ensemble are priceless.
There are few surprises here, but its very predictably, presented in such a charmingly magical way, results in a film that lifts the heart as it entertains. The settings, costumes, music, and  special effects are all first rate. In this film about love, what's not to love?",1210636800,2,1266,5.115942028985507

Well, we were wrong.  We didn't just like ""Enchanted"".  We all loved it.  To me, with the big, fun, colorful, well-developed musical numbers, it's almost like a return to a different cinematic era - one where the story tells the story instead of special effects telling the story.  Amy Adams and James Marsden are wonderful, and McDreamy and the young actress who plays his daughter are really good, too.  I feel that this film is appropriate for kids of pretty much any age, although Susan Sarandon's character might frighten some.

The one ""downer"" (and I use the word very lightly) is that the beginning of the movie - the animated portion - moves more slowly and is less entertaining than the live action section.  It's not unenjoyable, but I felt that the movie really got going once Giselle arrived in New York.

The choice to make it a musical also alienated me a bit, because the songs are all really annoying (It's no Sound of Music.)

80011,5,078887148X,"In the magical, animated land of Andalasia, a beautiful maiden named Giselle sings to her animal friends of her inevitable meeting with a charming prince who will whisk her away to her own happily ever after! Sure enough, she soon meets such a prince, the insufferably charming Prince Edward. The wedding is immediately on, but Edward's stepmother, the evil Queen Narissa, has no intention of losing her royal status. Thus begins Narissa's labored attempt to thwart the ever upbeat Giselle's happily ever after. In the guise of an old hag, she sends Giselle down an enchanted well and into the real, live-action world of contemporary New York City, a place where, according to Narissa, there are no happily ever afters.

Within the real world, Giselle appears real herself, as do Prince Edward and Giselle's chipmunk friend, Pip, who later follow on a rescue mission to find her. On her own in New York at night, still unclear on just what has happened to her and why, Giselle is extraordinarily lucky (or is it fate?) to be discovered by a single father named Robert and his sweet little girl who holds a not uncommon fascination with princesses and fairytales. Reminiscent of Maureen O'Hara in ""Miracle on 34th Street"", Robert has been burned by love, abandoned by the mother of his child, and is opposed to tales of true love and the idea that dreams come true. Intent on raising his child with a ""real world"" sensibility, he is reluctant to become involved with the clearly contrary Giselle, but his good nature makes it unavoidable. Robert takes Giselle in, intending it to only be temporary, but her magical presence and unrelentingly optimistic personality soon turn Robert's world upside down. As Robert tries to last through Giselle's spontaneous (and beautiful) singing and animal friends' antics long enough for her prince to come retrieve her, he also has to keep things square with his own halfhearted romance to city girl Nancy and not lose his well-grounded mindset in the process. Meanwhile, Prince Edward has acquired the help of Narissa's untrustworthy servant, Nathaniel, who is on his own mission to lead Edward astray while attempting to serve up poison apples to Giselle at every chance he gets with only little Pip aware enough to try and foil him. Eventually, everyone comes together and all truth comes out for a truly magnificent, truly Disney finale!

The first time I saw it, Disney's ""Enchanted"" instantly became one of my top favorite films! To the hardcore Disney fanatic, it should be seen as nothing less than a new Disney Masterpiece. It is, as director Kevin Lima says, a celebration of all things Disney. It's the culmination of 80 years of Disney magic! Everything about it is simply wonderful, and at its heart is an all new Disney ""princess"" story that is every bit as delightful, magical, and fantastic as those of Snow White, Ariel, Cinderella, Aurora, Belle, and all those other Disney dreamgirls. Amy Adams makes a perfect Disney ""princess"", and I know Disney princesses. I've been trying to find one for years! Oh, they're around, but not in my area and never single. Le sigh... She couldn't be more gorgeous, nor could her voice, and her performance is simply marvelous! The rest of the cast is flawless as well, with Patrick Dempsey playing a believable and perfect contrast to Princess Giselle's whimsy, Susan Sarandon as a living embodiment of the traditional Disney villainess, James Marsden spot-on as the dashing and slightly narcissistic prince, Timothy Spall as the humorously devious Nathaniel, Rachel Covey as little Morgan (Robert's daughter), and Idina Menzel as Robert's love-interest, Nancy. We even get Disney legends Julie Andrews as the opening narrator and Jodi Benson as Robert's secretary. Disney's musical magicians Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz handled the music here, earning Oscar nominations for 3 of the 5 outstanding original songs! I am definitely getting the soundtrack! The traditional, Art Nouveau animation, in the few animated sequences, is top-notch Disney quality, and so are the visual effects, from the CGI Pip in the real world to a creature in the finale that is Pip's complete opposite. Of course, for the Disney fanatic like myself, one of the big treats of watching ""Enchanted"" is spotting the countless nods to Disney films of the past. There are far too many for me to try to list! Not that the novelty takes away from the story at all. Following Giselle's adventure in New York and the changes and development of the characters as they affect each other is a priceless experience that may even bring tears to your eyes!

In my opinion, ""Enchanted"" is unquestionably a must-own film. Whether you are a Disney fanatic or not, you'll likely find it plenty entertaining if you're not opposed to magical films altogether. The decision would be on which version to get. The film has been released on DVD in widescreen and fullscreen formats, and also on Blu-Ray. Personally, I can't afford the upgrade to Blu-Ray yet, so I picked up the widescreen DVD. People, don't buy fullscreen. It's dumb. The picture quality, even on the humble, regular DVD that I went with, is stunning, and so is the sound. The bonus features are a bit light though. Sadly, a film so deserving of a commentary in this case has none (I'm sure we'll see one in a later release). What we do get are three nice behind-the-scenes featurettes on two of the main musical numbers and the finale at the ball, a blooper reel, six deleted scenes, and ""Pip's Predicament: A Pop-Up Adventure"". Pip's Predicament was pretty disappointing. Despite knowing what to expect, it still felt pathetic the whole time. Rather than make a real animated short (as PIXAR would have), Disney used the pop-up book style of telling a story here to do it more cheaply, and a rather weak story it is. Might have been okay in animation though. There are also two Easter Eggs, though they're not really hidden. One is the Carrie Underwood music video for ""Ever, Ever After"", the end song of the film. The video is a bit goofy in the live-action sequences, but it has original animation, and that's always appreciated. What they were trying to do was pretty good, and they pulled it off okay. Glad to have it as an extra. The other Easter Egg is more frustrating that pleasant. It is basically an advertisement for the Blu-Ray release of Enchanted, letting us know that on the Blu-Ray disc there is an extra featurette showcasing various Disney film comparisons to Enchanted. We get a slight taste of it, so that's cool, but who wants to have their nose rubbed in the ground for not buying the Blu-Ray. That stuff is still too pricey, especially the players themselves. But, when I do get a Blu-Ray player, I'll have little trouble repurchasing ""Enchanted"". It's just that good!

One last comment about bonus features. When this film was released, Target stores carried it with a bonus disc holding a 31 minute behind-the-scenes featurette on the film. It's an excellent featurette, and you should really seek out that bonus disc on Ebay or something. It is a crime that this featurette was only available as a new release bonus from a particular retailer. This featurette should have been on all releases of the DVD.

If you enjoy ""Enchanted"", look for these awesome flicks on DVD: ""The Little Mermaid"" (read my review for the Platinum Edition), ""Cinderella"", ""Snow White"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" (coming soon to DVD and Blu-Ray!), ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", ""Pinocchio"", ""The Sword in the Stone"", ""The Black Cauldron"", ""Peter Pan"", ""Mary Poppins"", ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"", and, well, anything Disney really, my favorite film of all time, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and coming soon from Disney, ""The Princess and the Frog"" and ""Rapunzel""! I also recommend the Cannon Movie Tales, ""Ever After"", ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (not for kids), ""The Slipper and the Rose"", ""Ella Enchanted"" (I haven't really seen it and it looks a bit goofy, but you might like it), ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Return to Oz"", ""The Wiz"", the Shrek film series, and Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre. Now, I'm sure I forgot some... There are also some Disney direct-to-video sequels that are not bad, believe it or not, like Cinderella 3, and I, for one, am highly anticipating the upcoming TinkerBell movie and Little Mermaid prequel. They are my two favorite Disney girls, after all, though I adore Giselle almost as much!",1209686400,,8432,4.914385964912281

The only downside is that so much of Disney's ""bad"" characters have developed into such a ""dark side"" look. I wish they would not make it so scary looking for children! Narissa (the stepmother, played by Susan Sarandon), did not have to be so scary and destructive in her ""characters"" to get the point across.

The only gripe concerns sequences with CGI cockroaches trying to help the heroine clean up the flat. Shivers and gossebumps for me (I am really allergic to their very sight! Yuk!)

I found myself laughing out loud at the play on so many of the classics from Disney. Of course, only Disney could take these classic ideas to this extreme. Any other studio would have been sued for 'abuse' of the Disney characters, like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Prince Charming and more.

When the heroine sings out of a New York City apartment window to summon the 'little creatures' for assistance, I was not prepared for the city dwelling helpers to include cockroaches. I groaned as they bored out of the bath tub drain; and then, I had to laugh. Yes, Disney even makes cockroaches seem...hmmm?...helpful, cute and loveable. Did I really say that?!!!

I also enjoyed the constant disrespect for the stero-typical Prince, whose obnoxious goodness is too campy for words. I only wish that Disney had reverted back to animation for the final sequence with the dragon.

80045,4,078887148X,"When Mike Myers poked fun at fairy tales in the ""Shrek"" films, he did so by blending pop culture into the stories.  The result was hilarious.  Disney takes the humor up a notch with the live action/briefly animated family feature, ""Enchanted.""  With a vast amount of excellent material to use as references, Disney took the generic story of a princess living in a fantasy land and smacked it in the face with a good dose of New York-style reality.  The result this time was a film that was more family-friendly than ""Shrek"" but just as funny, with countless in-jokes that only Disney fans can pick up on.

Amy Adams heads up the cast as Princess Giselle, a gullible, ""golly-gee"" generic Disney princess who thinks anything and everything can be solved with a song or true love's kiss.  Her love, Prince Edward (hammed up by James Marsden), has plans to marry her.  Those plans seem to be going quite well until Edward's wicked stepmother Queen Narissa (a devilish Susan Sarandon), pushes Giselle through a portal that sends her to reality, literally, in Times Square hoping to rid the kingdom and the queenship of her.

When reality checks in, animation checks out.  Adams wanders aimlessly around trying to find help, which results in some funny moments in the film.  She finally stumbles upon Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his cute daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey).  Robert's up to his neck in relationship problems at work and at home.  Giselle's goofy way of doing things only adds to this at first, but as the tale rolls along Robert realizes that all of that mushy fairy tale stuff just might actually work.

Meanwhile, Prince Edward has jumped through the portal in order to find his true love.  Along for the ride is Pip, a hilarious chipmunk that's sure to make the kiddies laugh.  Marsden's character suffers from a wicked dose of ""knight in shining armor,"" and his interactions with the residents of NYC make for some funny moments.

Of course, the wicked stepmother has to cover her tracks.  In order to do this, she sends bumbling Nathaniel (an excellent Timothy Spall) to finish off Giselle.  Pip does his best to warn Edward of Nathaniel's motives, but Edward believes that Nathaniel's there to help him.  In the end, though, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.  This means that Narissa pays reality a visit with some good ol' fashioned fantasy wickedness.  Will the damsel-in-distress be saved?  Will Narissa keep her crown?  Who falls in love?  Who loses love?  You'll have to watch to find out.

The entire cast is solid, including Elpheba Idina Menzel as Nancy, Robert's real-world love interest.  She has a small role in the film, but she delivers a solid performance.  The special effects are excellent, including a climactic face off with a dragon.  The only minor letdown is the musical in the film, which is almost too generic to befit what will probably become a classic Disney film.  It isn't terrible, but it isn't up to par with the music in the films that it references.

Old and young fans alike will enjoy picking apart scenes to determine which Disney film is being referenced.  Some of the references are more subtle than you'd think, which makes it that much more fun to figure them out.  The DVD comes with a pop-up adventure featuring Pip that I'm sure will please youngsters as well as deleted scenes, a Carrie Underwood video and other features.

Overall, ""Enchanted"" stands as a solid family film.  There is a little sexual innuendo and almost a nude scene (thank heaven for the help of small woodland creatures), but nothing that a young child will be able to pick up on.  I don't recall any bad language at all.  There is a little violence, but nothing too disturbing.  While this is a good family film, I suggest watching the wonderful Disney classics that this movies references to see just how magical the wonderful world of Disney can be.

80060,1,078887148X,"First, let me say that I am not a man-hater or necessarily a feminist.  I'm all for equality, though.  I'm not a troll, either.  I'm not trying to be inflammatory.  And no, I am not a hippy all stinky with patchouli and wet wool, and I am NOT voting for Hillary Clinton.

I just finished watching the movie ""Enchanted,"" which is one of Disney's new, modern, feel-good romances, starring Amy Adams and that guy who was cute in the 80s, then got plastic surgery and is now on Grey's Anatomy.

The movie started great. The princess, a total moron, falls for a prince, who is also a total moron, simply because they heard each other singing in the forest. It was a great setup. Then they all become ""real,"" and are suddenly in Manhattan.

The Grey's Anatomy Yutz (let's just call him G.A.Y.), of course, falls instantly for the vacuous princess, and his fiance, who is an intelligent woman with (GASP) a career, sort of figures it out, but is okay with the whole thing.

Career women don't mind being tossed aside, and in the name of Disney-brand ""true love,"" she ends up falling for the stupid, effeminate prince.  Because surely, she must secretly want to be ""the man"" in the relationship.

In the finale, the queen, played by Susan Sarandon, turns into a dragon and is portrayed as an evil uber-bitch as she wants to keep her crown rather than leave it to her Forrest-Gumpy stepson, the effeminate prince. So she gets killed (to great cheers from the imagined audience), G.A.Y. of course ends up with the moron Amy Adams princess, and the effeminate prince gets the ""smart,"" but oddly emotionless former G.A.Y. fiance by default. Everybody's happy, and the credits roll.

Am I the only one who was actually REALLY upset by this ending? I am actually still in a messy, slobbery rage over yet another misogynist-disguised-as-moralistic movie in which being a woman completely dependent on some man swooping in to SAVE her is the best thing to be?

That ""true-love's kiss"" is the most powerful thing in the world?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME???

It's 2008, and yet everyone in the world (even outside Taliban-controlled areas of the world) seems to think it's the middle ages as far as women are concerned.

According to Disney, these are the rules:
-If we women are meek, stupid, frail and pretty, we are in GREAT shape.  We will get a man, who will make our lives complete.
-If we have brains in our heads, have a job, and rational perspectives on things, it's perfectly okay to just toss us aside in favor of someone who needs to be saved.

Just because I don't know how to make my own clothes, and I know how to form a thought in my brain, and actually, gods forbid EXPRESS my thoughts and opinions, I may as well be a dragon to be pushed off the top of a freaking building.

Susan Sarandon, who has always chosen her roles well in the past, should be ashamed of herself. Same with Amy Adams, who was BRILLIANT in ""Junebug."" Same with every single person who does anything for Disney. And shame on me for watching this film.

If you are a woman or know a woman who is even SLIGHTLY above average intelligence, don't bother putting yourself in the path of this movie.

This movie makes me feel completely worthless. If this is an expression of what the world is like, I don't want to live in it. I am ashamed to be a human. I wish there was some sort of magic laser that could transform me into some other creature than human. I wish I had an ice pick. If I did, I swear to all that is holy that I would lobotomize this demoralizing movie out of my head.  If it failed and I died, it would still be worth it.

If anyone mentions ""Disney"" to me in anything other than a derogatory manor, I will smack them across their face.",1208563200,19,3714,4.454948301329394

80063,5,078887148X,"I had originally planned not to see this film (""Disney? Nah!"") , but I did, for two good reasons: first, it starred the STILL woefully unappreciated Amy Adams (and if you haven't yet seen ""Junebug"", go rent it; you'll see why see got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work in that film), and second, my sister, a soccer mom with no tolerance for treacle, told me that it was something adults would enjoy. She was right, but on matters of popular culture, she always is.

The action begins in the (animated) kingdom of Andalasia. Adams is charming as Giselle, the naive fairy tale maiden who falls in love with her prince, agrees to marry him as soon as they meet (this is Andalasia, not Earth) and is banished on her wedding day (the next morning) by his mother, the Wicked Queen, to a place ""where there are no happily ever afters"": Manhattan. There, in her full length hoopskirted bridal gown, she is adrift, vainly searching for some way to get back to her Prince, until she is reluctantly given shelter by a single father (Patrick Dempsey) and his little daughter, who sees more in Giselle than her father does.

A special treat for me was seeing the places where I used to work, places I miss seeing and used to take for granted - Columbus Circle, Central Park, even the Time-Warner building! (I worked in the Paine Webber building). My spouse and I used to drive to work, and were always frustrated when the crosstown road running through Central Park was closed (or slowed down by rubberneckers looking for celebrities) because someone was making a movie. But in this instance, the time they took was well worth it.

As Giselle, Adams is both beguiling and funny in a natural, artless way. As Edward, her Prince, who goes to Manhattan to find his Giselle, James Marsden is an absolute hoot. I've never seen a human being look so much like a Disney cartoon prince as Marsden does, and I don't intend that as an insult - he's just uncannily perfect-looking. He takes the role of Edward and plays it with such a goofy brio that I couldn't help but be delighted by his performance.

This may be a fairy tale, but is is, for the most part, set in New York City, and so there are thousands of extras other than people - rats, pigeons, waterbugs and assorted vermin are the City's version of the ""woodland creatures"" who love and are loved by Giselle. New Yorkers will appreciate the nod to the realities of Manhattan, because a Manhattan without vermin is WAY too unrealistic, even for a fairy tale :)

I don't want to say too much about the story, but I will say that it's a thoroughly enjoyable film. The ending sung, sung by Carrie Underwood, is pretty good too.",1208476800,3,2677,4.545643153526971

There is nothing in it that a child cannot see yet adults can enjoy the wit.  A lot of the film is a takeoff on the older Disney collection: the cartoon princess waiting for her love's ""one true kiss"" and just leaving it there, etc.

But some of the bits are wonderful. Amy Adams as the Princess is marvelous. Her scene in a divorce lawyer's office when she realized that a couple is parting FOREVER is great.

The songs are a bit weak, not up to standard Disney levels.

But the performances by Adams, Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden are exceptionally good.

80073,5,078887148X,Patrick Dempsey is Great in this film. It is his Best Acting role of his career and his Best Film. He plays the leading man role of a lawyer named Robert. Patrick Dempsey acts sincere and serious. Amy Adams is the leading lady a modern day fairy tale princess who sings. The Best scene in the movie is with Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams dancing at the Ball and singer Jon McLaughlin sings the song So Close. The way the scene is played by Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams is story book like Romance. They should make more movies like this. Patrick Dempsey is a Great actor and should be in more family movies like this. He is good in his role. There is audience for movies like this. It shows Hollywood they are able to make good family movies that make money. The filn has done good sales in theatres and in DVD and it is because it is a good film and the leading lady and man are good. Amy Adams is good in the role. Patrick Dempsey mentioned in a interview that she is like Julie Andrews. There is a scene where Patrick Dempsey asks Amy where she got the dress and she tells him she made it from his curtains just like The Sound Of Music movie. There is alot of fun and funny scenes in the movie though it is the great acting abilities of Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams that make the film special. You know the characters Love each other though it is not until the scene where they are dancing at the Ball with the song So Close being played that you know they really do Love each other and will Marry. There should be more musicals and this one is a all time favorite and if you like Dorothy and The Wizard Of Oz you should enjoy this. If you like Patrick Dempsey then you should enjoy this film. He is dressed in a business suit and later in a prince costume at the ball.

80076,5,078887148X,"I passed on this one in the theaters, but after hearing and reading so many positive reviews, I bought the DVD sight unseen.  And I've actually been kicking myself for not seeing it on the big screen.  Enchanted is a perfectly delightful fairy tale.  And while there are some cliches (the fish-out-of-water thing, mostly), the movie's success hinges almost solely on the pitch-perfect performance of Amy Adams as the princess Giselle.

Also refreshing is an almost complete lack of modern cynicism that affects so many movies, even other ""family"" fare.  This is best given voice by a character who comments on Prince Edward's (a brilliant comic turn by James Marsden) profession of true love for Giselle: ""You say that without a touch of irony.""

There's a handful of song-and-dance numbers that are a joy to watch.  There's the obligatory CGI animal sidekick, Pip the chipmunk.  And there's Susan Saradon's scene-chewing evil queen.  And amidst all the fun and laughter, there are many references/inside jokes to the Disney's rich history of animated films.  But even if you don't catch them all--and I'm sure I missed a few--you'll still have a great time watching this one.  In fact, I can't wait to watch it again.  When's the last time you watched a movie and immediatly wanted to go back and watch it again?

I can't imagine better casting.  Amy Adams does ""wide-eyed innocent"" like it's never been done before (even better than Judy Garland in ""Wizard of Oz"").  Patrick Dempsey is the ultimate skeptic and general naysayer - nothing in life is ever as good as it seems.  James Marsden plays the fairy-tale prince to the hilt, and is hysterical doing it.  After all, ""what's not to like"" about him?  Timothy Spall as the simpering assistant who finds redemption in the end is hilarious.  Susan Sarandon is completely over the top as the evil queen, and has never been more entertaining!  The best part, even my 2-year-old likes this movie, and the ""scary"" scenes aren't too much for her to handle.  Both of my girls are now singing songs from the movie, all of which are catchy and endearing in their own way.  I actually laughed out loud when Dempsey's character showed amazement that everyone seems to know the song Giselle breaks into in the middle of Central Park (he knows the song, too?  how come I've never heard this song before?) - after all, isn't that how musicals work?

80097,5,078887148X,"Fortunately for us in Australia, not just the USA, Walt Disney was forging ahead in leaps and bounds in both cinematic releases and television right up to his death in 1966.

With television only being introduced in Australia in time for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, we were already starved for entertainment.  The Disney Studios successfully exported the ""Disneyland"" and ""Mickey Mouse Club"" TV shows to Australia, where despite only having been made for 3 years, the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" shows were broadcast for 14 years!!!  I even remember seeing the Mouseketeers when they toured here in 1959 and 1960, despite the fact that I was only 4 and 5 at the time... Yes I've been a Disney fan for almost 50 years!  For those who need to catch up, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walt-Disney-The-Triumph-of-the-American-Imagination-Vintage/dp/0679757473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination (Vintage)</a>

Walt Disney was a true visionary and was responsible for the public acceptance of many major innovations including respectable theme parks and even space travel and exploration.  Walt's attitude of ""keep moving forward"" never allowed numerous instances of impending financial ruin to daunt his efforts to produce astounding improvements within the entertainment industry - from his innovations in animation techniques to the planning of Disneyworld and EPCOT in Florida.  Fortunately since his death in 1966, the Disney Corporation has continued this approach of constant improvement, despite ruining Walt's true plans for EPCOT.

ENCHANTED IS THE EPITOME OF ALL THINGS DISNEY.  It pays homage to Walt's great early animated triumphs, ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" and infuses Walt's love for the combination of live action and animated characters right through to the extraordinary CG-animation perfected by the recently acquired Pixar Studios.  Some critics have failed to grasp the relevance to so many great Disney offerings handled so well under the clever writing by Bill Kelly and precise direction of Kevin Lima.  In true Disney form, characters fall in love almost instantly and are not daunted by their apparent non-conformtiy in modern day New York, for example, James Marsden's excellent portrayal of the affected Prince Edward.

To the uninitiated, the ending may appear to go a little off track, but again refers to the early Disney classics, including the poison apple and the transformation of the evil queen into an equally evil dragon.  Followed by the clever use of the pop-up book technique which takes Disney animation a step further.  These are made totally transparent and obvious in the Disney Blu-Ray DVD release.

Amy Adams portrays a true Disney Princess, like no other before her, and is offset well by the very corporatised Patrick (McDreamy) Dempsey.  Susan Sarandon also appears to have been born to play a Disney Evil Queen and Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew from the Harry Potter series) is a real life version of so many animated Disney sidekicks.  Congratulations also to (Aussie) John O'Connell for his all-inclusive, interpretative choreography so befitting a true Disney classic!

To sum up, I believe that Walt Disney would be EXTREMELY PROUD of this great offering which has been produced truly in his style 40 years after his demise.  For those with a Blu-Ray DVD player buy that version to truly appreciate the references to Walt's genius!",1207785600,,3478,5.479400749063671

80099,3,078887148X,"""Enchanted"" is a clever high-concept film - a princess from a Disney-esque animated fairy tale gets banished by the wicked queen to real world NYC, only to be pursued by her prince and other assorted characters. That it was even done by Disney made it even more appealing. Then the Disney pre-Oscar publicity machine shifted into high gear turning it into a ""must see"" event. Because of circumstances, I missed it in theaters and so bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.

Despite the hype, this is, at its heart, a small film. That's not to say cheap - every penny of its budget is on the screen for all the world to see. It also has some great moments, alternatively wonderful, cute, funny, and nostalgic. However, it's ultimately an unsubstantial film. My life wouldn't have been diminished if I'd never seen it.

Had I seen it with more modest expectations, I would have enjoyed it more. Which is all to say that it's a good film, but not a great film.",1207785600,5,958,4.468571428571429

I was a little concerned that the dragon might have been too scary for my four year old but she had no problems with it. The best part of the movie was the music. Alan Menken is one of the best composers Disney has ever hired for their movies and this time out was no exception. All of the songs are memorable and even my small kids like them all. They sing to the soundtrack constantly and always want to hear it when we're in the car.

There's something in the movie for everyone, both adults and kids, so I'm not surprised this movie was a great success. The acting of Amy Adams and James Marsden was exceptional as those two essentially made the movie what it was. I look forward to seeing them both back when the sequel is made. I just hope the sequel won't be a disappointment like so many sequels have been.

It's my favorite Disney classic movie ever and I've seen just about all of them.

The Blu-ray has the D-Files, the only addition that the Blu-ray version has that the DVD doesn't. I'm a little disappointed that the only way to play it is to watch it throughout the movie through periodic interruptions. I would have preferred that it be an offline game. Also, you can't see the special snippets if you miss a question. Other than that, the D-Files was very interesting and informative and is well worth going through at least once. I would have preferred to see more deleted scenes, too. I've seen some scenes elsewhere that were cut that weren't on the DVD or the Blu-ray.

I am a fan of film music (I find a will buy a DVD based on the quality of the music in the film) and this has some major songs in it. Amy Adams turns out to be a great singer as well.

80106,5,078887148X,"Enchanted was a great Disney film, and let's face it folks the best Disney films had singing in them.  But this one was a complete satire of Disney films.

WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS

Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful, yet naive strawberry-blond haired beauty named Giselle (Amy Adams).  She lived in the forest with her animal friends, her best friend is a chipmunk named Pip.  Well anyways a handsome but just as naive as Giselle, prince named Edward (James Marsdan)comes and rescues her when she falls, and they decide that after one day to be married.

Now how would your parents feel after they found out you planned to marry to a total stranger you just met?  Just ask Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) Edward's step-mother.  However, she's conserned for a totally different reason, she feels that once Edward weds that the thrown will be his.  So to keep her thrown, she disquises herself as an old hag and pushes Giselle down a well or magic portal, to a place where ""there are no happily ever afters"".

Amazingly enough, Giselle ends up in New York, no longer a cartoon but real person, and people aren't very nice to her. Meanwhile she stumbles across a cynical divored, but dashingly flawed lawyer named Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), and his daughter Morgan.  Morgan is thrilled while Robert is a little bewildered by Giselle's naiveity.

Then Prince Edward with the help of Pip comes into the real world also to rescue Giselle and even slays a dragon, which is actually a bus.  Then Nathaniel (Timothy Spall), who is head over heals in love with Narissa, follows them and tries to track Giselle down and kill her all because he wants to impress Narissa.

Meanwhile all sorts of magical things happen with Giselle around, she can command the dirty animals of New York to clean the house up, burst into song only to have others sing along, and she makes her own dresses out of curtians.

This only leads to one question, where's happily ever after in all of this?  Is Robert's girlfriend Nancy (Idina Menzel, better known as Ty Digg's wife) right for him, or will something better come along for the two of them?  Will Giselle share true love's kiss with Edward or will something better come along?  Will Pip save the day?  Will Nathaniel realize that Narissa isn't the person he thinks she is and will something better come along for him?  I'm not telling you have to watch and see, you'll like the ending I promise you!

Anyways, the cast and acting is great!  I give Amy Adams, James Marsdon, and Timothy Spall credit for running around in old fasioned clothing and tights.

The music by the famous Alan Menken who worked on Aladdin and so forth, was great, I don't even like country and I would listen to the Carrie Underwood song on the soundtrack ""Ever Ever After"".  Maybe I should go out and by the soundtrack, but that's a different story.

80109,5,078887148X,"I must say that Amy Adams is really growing on me. I've seen her in a few things, but I really have been enjoying her. She stars in Enchanted as Princess Giselle who is destined to marry her true love. In true Disney fashion, there's an evil witch/stepmom who sets out to ruin that dream b/c she wants to be queen.  So she sends Giselle through a well, and she lands in New York. She soon discovers that she's ""not in Kansas anymore""

I was interested in the movie when it was in theaters, but never got around to seeing it. In the beginning, the cartoon portion caught me off guard, but the movie seamlessly switched over to the live-action.

All of the actors played their roles well. I've already mentioned AA, but who doesn't love Patrick Dempsey?  I've had a crush on him since Can't Buy Me Love, and ignoring Grey's Anatomy, he was born to play the handsome guy. He plays Robert, the widower with a young daughter who loves princesses and takes an instant attachment to Giselle. He's got the Miracle on 34th Street syndrome where he's the cynical parent who doesn't believe.  James Marsden plays Prince Edward who reminds me of the good Prince Charming from Disney films plus the Prince Charming from Shrek, plus Gaston from Beauty and the Beast.  He's all those things minus the evil characteristics.  His landing in NYC is particularly funny, and there's a scene btwn he and Dempsey that cracks me up.

Long live the family-friendly movies! I plan on buying the DVD for my own personal collection, but also for my niece as well. It's a delightful musical (one of my fave genres) that entertains across all age groups.  The story is does follow the fairy tale template, but I really enjoyed the journey there. There were lots of funny moments. You won't be disappointed.

And of course, most of the time, all of this is accompanied by a few dwarves or cuddly animals, as well as a song or two.

What I loved about ""Enchanted"" was that it thoroughly satisfies all of the requirements above -- and it also just as deftly skewers them, for those who like their entertainments a little less syrupy.  The fact that this is Disney skewering itself is pretty delightful and surprising, frankly, and ""Enchanted"" is a treat from start to finish. Whether you're in the mood for a Disney fairytale cartoon, or a movie making fun of a Disney fairytale cartoon, ""Enchanted"" will fit the bill for you. (Like ""Galaxyquest,"" the movie is just as superb an homage as it is a wicked spoof.)

The movie is wonderfully written, with a smart, witty and knowing script, and the actors are all equally wonderful, each so well cast they appear to have stepped out of a cartoon (a good thing, since that's what they literally do here).  With her innocent blue eyes and strawberry curls, Amy Adams is a heroine come to life, with a light, strong soprano singing voice and an absolutely divine sense of comic timing.  Patrick Dempsey does the lawyerly/princely thing very nicely here, and with a touch of sadness that suits him very well. But the real surprise for me was James Marsden, who is absolutely hilarious as the hapless Prince in pursuit of his lady love -- from the pratfalls to his fabulous singing voice, he's absolutely ridiculously perfect.

On the slighty less successful front: While I loved Susan Sarandon as the Evil Witch, she's not in it terribly much (nor are her motives always all that clear, especially in the end, when her intervention seems completely unnecessary). There's a great moment when the queen stomps across a busy New York street, electricity flying angrily from her fingertips, and it's so funny and well-done that I wished for more of this.  I wanted to see the Queen adjusting to the perils of NYC too -- dealing with a hapless doorman or a surly cabbie, for instance. And we see far too little of poor Idina Menzel, who does make a thankless role sweet and believable (I also can't believe they cast this fabulous singer and didn't let her make a peep).

But overall ""Enchanted"" is what it says it is, and then some. The songs by longtime pro Alan Mencken are every bit as good as you'd expect (and are by turns naughty, funny, and surprisingly lovely), and the humor is quick, sharp, and tart. Aside from the hilariousness of the ""Happy Working Song,"" I personally am still giggling over an incident involving a chipmunk, a hanger, and a closet.",1207440000,,2809,4.677484787018256

80127,5,078887148X,"""Enchanted"" is a delightful, sweet tale of a fairy-tale princess transported to the real world, with her prince following her to bring her back.

Hopelessly lost and confused, she stumbles into the relucant help of Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan.

Prince Edward (James Marsden) and his helper follow her in, and are equally unprepared for the new world, leading them to attack buses and talk to TV sets.

Watching this reminded me when Disney was truly a magic place, producing classic after classic. ""Enchanted"" deserves to be a classic. Amy Adams is on her way to becoming a true movie star.

As a child, I devoured Disney.  My parents (where do you think I got my analytical, critical tendencies?) had a lot to say against The Mouse, but my sisters and I were addicts.  I even had Mickey Mouse ears, and wore them to school one day (almost got laughed to death, too).  But in adulthood I turned against The Mouse.  I don't like to see my granddaughters watching and re-watching hyper-femmy heroines with iconic long hair drifting around and capturing the prince, etc.  I don't like Disney World.
But I LIKED THIS MOVIE!  A LOT!  In it I saw satirical references to the happy, loving animals in Snow White; I saw Bambi; I think there was something of Chip and Dale; there was a cafe named after the song from Lady and the Tramp (Bella Notte), and in the next scene a dog pees on someone's nice black shoe; I saw Cinderella's coach, Ratatouille's kitchen...the rats,cockroaches, and pigeons cleaning up a New York apartment are worth the price of this show all by themselves!  (Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo!)
Twyla Tharp's (somewhat disappointing) movie rendition of carefree hippie dancing in the film version of *Hair*!  The watery reggae musician-dudes of The Little Mermaid!  King Kong! Part of the action takes place in a Time-Warner building!
There's probably more that I missed. The bottom line is that this film is a very entertaining little story with a lot of references (I almost said ""cultural"", but....) to what we all grew up with:  Cartoons!  And don't forget that the kernels of all these stories (Snow White, Little Mermaid, Cinderella, etc.) are old tales, really old ones - yes, children, older than evn old cartoons.
There was a lot of intelligence and taste involved in the making of this flick.  The sensibility behind it was that of our time - hopefulness spiced with cynicism and a feeling that we've seen and been through an awful, awful lot.....and all the actors were great.  What more can you ask?
Well, the reason I didn't give it a top five-star rating is that there are some continuity problems (what color is the heroine's hair NOW?  when did she get Invisalign braces?) and some shifts in energy and focus that disrupt the rhythm of the film in an inartistic way, one of the worst being the shopping trip taken by wanna-be-princess Giselle and her step-daughter-to-be.

 Enchanted is a hybrid of everything good about old time Disney. You get thrusted in a happily-ever-after kingdom, complete with the Prince Charming, peppy little woodland creatures and topped of with the evil old witch. Disney mixes everything that is Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty then hurls them into it onto the concrete slabs of NYC. All of the fun innocence that is a fairy-tale gets contrasted too the Big Apple. Music is phenominal, in every sense of the term. The lively tunes from 60's Disney flicks are timeless, especialy once you mix songs of par-quality in real time spots in New York. Amy Adams gives a beautiful show, really showing what a happy-go-lucky princess would look, carry, talk, and yes, dance with a broom, in our reality. Team that audio and acting with a 'lost princess' story theme that could easily contend with one of Walt's oldies makes Enchanted a modern masterpeice.

Sit back and let Disney take you away on another great adventure. Special features - Disney can be annoying that they think deleted scenes mean storyboards that haven't been animated.

Others also played well too.  For the direction, it was very clear, simple and good.  For the visuals, they were excellent especially the night fight scene on the roof in the end.

80135,5,078887148X,"They could have cast other actors in any of the other roles, but for the role of Giselle the wood nymph, I can think of no other actress who could have carried this movie the way Amy Adams did. Every thing about her performance as Giselle was perfect, every hand movement, every playful/innocent look, and move.

She should have won an Oscar as I can think of no film in 2007 that had a better performance by a female lead. And this was an extremely difficult role to pull off!! But we know the academy only give Oscars for ""serious"" roles. Sigh....

As noted by other reviewers this movie is a collation of many Disney movies/themes but it all works beautifully. People talk about ""Disney magic"" but in modern times there are very few Disney films that are truly ""magic"". Well, look no further. This is your ""magical"" film that will leave you and your family happy and full of the purity that only a genuinely positive experience can bring.

Amy Adams is a treasure and I believe that this film will finally push her career into the ""elite"" of Hollywood actresses. She was nominated for an Oscar in ""Junebug"" so she has been knocking on the door for a while.

Amy has left me ""enchanted"".....and feeling like a kid again.",1206576000,4,1222,4.515837104072398

As the perennially sunny and interminably pregnant Ashley, she stole that picture easily, and the same holds true for this far more extravagant 2007 Disney production directed by Disney stalwart Kevin Lima (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/102-Dalmatians/dp/B00003CXQ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">102 Dalmatians</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarzan/dp/B000AAF1TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarzan</a>). This time, she provides the voice for Giselle, a fair maiden in bucolic woodland where the animals sing and dance as she dreams of kissing her prince. Fortunately, the handsome, self-absorbed Prince Edward shows up with his Marty Feldman-like sidekick Nathaniel in the nick of time as a gigantic troll is about to pounce on Giselle. They fall in love and decide to marry the next day.

However, Edward's stepmother, the evil Queen Narissa, does not want Giselle in line for the throne, so she plots to be rid of Giselle by pushing her into a portal that ends up in the middle of Manhattan's Times Square. It's at this point that the film turns to live action, and Giselle is fully embodied by Adams as a wedding ball-gowned fish-out-of-water. Bill Kelly's amusing though somewhat erratic screenplay has her going through the predictable shenanigans, including a chance encounter with Robert, a pragmatic divorce lawyer and a single father to Morgan, an Abigail Breslin-look-alike moppet who wonders if Giselle could be really a fairy princess. Of course, complications ensue with not only Robert's suspicious fiance Nancy but also Nathaniel, who has come after Giselle upon Narissa's orders. Edward also shows up, and consequently a romantic quadrangle develops with Giselle in an unfettered search for true love.

Most of the musical numbers by Disney veteran Alan Menken and Broadway composer Steven Schwartz are catchy and true to the spirit of the story. ""Happy Working Song"", a vermin-infested paean to Snow White's ""Whistle While You Work"", and ""That's How You Know"",  which mimics the calypso beat of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid/dp/B000F8O35U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid</a>'s ""Under the Sea"", benefit from witty staging and Adams' surprisingly clear soprano. The only exception is the turgid love ballad near the end, ""So Close"", sung by Michael Bolton-wannabe Jon McLaughlin. Beyond Adams, James Marsden plays the hilariously misguided prince with gleeful panache, and Timothy Spall dances easily between malevolent and befuddled as the conflicted Nathaniel. Susan Sarandon is slumming as the Queen, but once she finally shows up in human form, she puts her authoritative spin and killer rack into the character. Perhaps because his character is scripted as such a downer, Patrick Dempsey makes for a lifeless romantic lead for the ebullient Adams. A couple of familiar Broadway performers show up - Idina Menzel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked/dp/B0000TB01Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rent/dp/B000005ALT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rent</a>) as Nancy, and Tonya Pinkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caroline-Or-Change/dp/B00028HOG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caroline, Or Change</a>) as an embittered wife facing a nasty divorce.

The one problem I had with the movie is the drastic shift in tone during the overdone, CGI-saturated finale. While I can appreciate the female empowerment orientation being conveyed, the story could have easily ended about ten minutes earlier. Fortunately, the hand-drawn animation in the opening sequence is a fine tribute to Disney's pre-Pixar glory. Given it is from Disney, the 2008 DVD has plenty of extras beginning with a behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Fantasy Comes to Life"". Divided into three parts, it shows how the production numbers for ""Happy Working Song"" and ""That's How You Know"" came together, as well as the finale. There are six deleted scenes, all introduced by Lima, which includes a storyboard-only alternative to the opening sequence. A two-minute blooper reel is included, as well as a five-minute short for the kiddies called ""Pip's Predicament: A Pop-up Adventure"" about the daredevil chipmunk and a music video of Carrie Underwood's ""Ever Ever After"". Definitely better than I expected.",1206576000,4,4809,6.4743390357698285
80137,4,078887148X,"I know this will cost some 'Positive Feedback' votes, but while I found ""Enchanted"" technically superb, I felt it lacked 'heart', relying more on easy laughs than the magic that has always symbolized Disney, to me. The idea of a traditional Disney animated Princess being uprooted, and dropped into our world, was inspired, but I don't think Walt would have approved of much of what followed, even as a homage to many of his classics...

First off, I found Amy Adams annoying. My idea of a Disney heroine would have been a young Julie Andrews, who would have made Giselle's goodness and innocence believable, and desirable; Adams comes across as simple-minded and silly, instead. While her animal-aided clean-up of Patrick Dempsey's apartment channeled ""Snow White"", cockroaches were more low-brow than Disney, and emphasizing cleaning a cruddy toilet? If Giselle couldn't understand how a shower worked, how would she know what a toilet was? Did the magical realm of Andalasia, set in, I guess, around the 18th century, have toilets?

Patrick Dempsey didn't impress me, either. There was a lack of real warmth toward his daughter (Rachel Covey), and his growing love for the air-headed Giselle seemed contrived. He seemed superficial, certainly not as much as Prince Edward (James Marsden), but as the role is pivotal to the story's resolution, his character should be someone worth sacrificing life in Andalasia for...and, for me, he wasn't!

Moving on to the henchman, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall)...I didn't find his abusing the chipmunk funny (hooking it, spread-eagled, on a coat hanger, was uncomfortable, to me, looking nearly like a crucifixion!) His character also seemed far better-versed in our society than he should have been.

Then there is Susan Sarandon's evil Queen...While I loved the ""Snow White"" touches, why did she become a dragon, for the finale, when her 'master plan' (Edward and Giselle NOT marrying) had worked? Yeah, it homages ""Sleeping Beauty"", but it also introduced an element of Fantasy into the 'real' world so LARGE, and so destructive that it can't be explained away (which throws reality off-kilter, as the media attention would change our world, forever)...the ball finale should have ended with the 'true love kiss'...Is this too picky? Remember ""Darby O'Gill""? We all knew the magic existed, but it was something that was our 'special secret'...had leprechauns and a banshee marched through the village, it wouldn't have seemed nearly as 'magical'...I feel the same way about a dragon appearing in New York...

Loved the wonderful production number in Central Park, but the chipmunk's excreting poop in another scene would have been cut by Walt in a heartbeat!

Maybe I'm just too old-fashioned, but the films ""Enchanted"" pays tribute to ARE old-fashioned...and I expected something that would respect what made them so special...Five Stars for the Effects, Two Stars for the Cast and Story...",1206576000,5,2931,5.2123142250530785
80138,5,078887148X,"For the first time I can think of.... Disney found an internal sense of humor, the ability to truly laugh at its own conventions, all the while playing in to them!

  I was very surprised by ""Enchanted"", it is a movie that I would never have expected from Disney.  It pokes fun at the typical Disney fairytale, while still essentially being a typical Disney fairytale.  There are absolutely few surprises story-wise, but it works because the movie is intentionally over the top and self-conscious of where it comes from, the amazing performance by Amy Adams, which is sincere and fun, and awesome musical numbers .

  When the movie opens it is animated with a lonely maiden named Giselle (Amy Adams), in a cabin in the forest much like Sleeping Beauty.  She is singing about dreaming of her ""True Love's Kiss"", and of course this ""true love"" Prince Edward (James Marsden) appears pretty much right at that moment.  After this they are to wed the next day, but the plan is thwarted by his evil stepmother (Susan Surandon) to keep him from inheriting the throne.  The movie is then filmed in live-action once Giselle is transported to our world by the evil stepmother.  The rest of the movie is Giselle struggling to cope with anger and pain in this new world as she waits for Edward to rescue her, and coming to grips with the fact that he may never do so.

  The movie plays very well on the balance between spontaneous love and committed love.  Can you love someone at first sight?  Is that what a relationship is built on?  Or is a relationship really built on hard work and commitment without the romantic fluff.  It is something I never expected Disney to make, but I am glad that they did.  It is the first great live-action movie they have produced since Pirate's of the Carribean.

However, my favorite actor in this is James Marsden. His role is not very big, but he makes the most of it. He's charming and perfect as the dashing prince. Even Timothy Spall's small role is amusing. The only downside is Patrick Dempsey and Susan Sarandon who don't really accomplish much in their roles.

80147,4,078887148X,"So what do you do when you have done animated fairytale and live action fairytale movies? Why you mix the two of course. This isn't the first time we have seen live action and animated mixed, but this is certainly another successful mix of the two. If you enjoy movies like ""Mary Poppins"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Stardust"", and ""The 10th Kingdom"", you will probably find this entertaining. Some funny things happen and a cute chipmunk adds to the hilarity.

The premise as the Amazon review indicates is a to-be princess Giselle is teleported from her animated fairytale happiness by an evil to-be mother-in-law. She becomes a living person in New York City and bumps into a single father with a little girl that believes in fairytales. The prince from the fairytale gets himself teleported to New York City to find his true love princess. Things don't always work out as you might expect and the princess learns some interesting things about New Yorkers, good and bad. An ""enchanting' movie, pun intended. I have rented and seen it a few times on cable and now I intend to add it to my video library.

My wife and I enjoyed the movie and I think most family members will find something entertaining about it. What made it different is the unique story and the great blending of the two worlds. You genuinely find yourself wondering, ""What if a fairytale princess came to life?"" Some scenes should definitely get a laugh or two. One example is the creatures that Giselle uses to clean house in New York are not quite the same as in a animated fairytale. Afterall what kind of creatures do you see the most of in New York City?

80148,5,078887148X,"I'm not much for singing in movies but then again I do like Robin Hood: Men in Tights and the Muppet movies. Ironic, right??

Here's a movie that takes a cartoon into the real world like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. We start with the lives of Princess Giselle looking for her one true love to marry. Prince Edward happens to be the single bachelor. Add in Patrick Dempsey who is a single father who notices the distressed princess as he brings his daughter home from her karate class. When all there lives cross again, add the evil Queen Narissa (who happens to be the step-mother of the Prince) seeks to prohibit this marriage because she doesn't want to relinquish her crown. Strange how the evil doer is related to the hero. Does this remind you of Shrek 2 (The Prince was the son of the Fairy Godmother)? Her plan was to banish the princess into another realm which just happens to be real time Manhattan. What happens when the princess in her poofy dress lands in Manhattan? Will the construction workers figure out that the manhole leads to the fairytale world? Will Prince Edward find Giselle before the queen?

All in all this movie has the Disney magic along with some laughs mixed in ( I love the bus driver who was angry at Prince Edward for ""stabbing her bus). The songs were short and pretty good. I didn't deduct any stars even though I mostly can't stand singing in movies since it's my own personal preference. The ending (don't want to give it away) was a little disappointing when you scratch your head and wonder why this action scene happened but it didn't take anything away from the movie.

This DVD comes with many extras including deleted scenes and blooper outakes which are my favorite. When you see the deleted scenes you might feel overjoyed that they weren't in the final cut of the movie lol. While the deleted scenes weren't that good, it's a nice touch to add them into the DVD extras.

Headed to happily ever after until perfect princess Giselle falls into reality, in the form of a New York sewer, and charms most creatures who come into contact with her. I began to be less enchanted as Giselle changed, but as she grew I enjoyed the progression to the satisfying end.

A little bit of Shrek twisted fairy tales, a bit of the charm from Just Visiting and Kate and Leopold, it's a sweet movie and an entertaining hour and a half. Several laugh out loud moments fill the film and the adventure was just silly enough to keep a smile on my face throughout.

I loved the musical aspect even though I generally don't like musicals. Giselle's charm was infectious and similar to George of the Jungle's innocence and enthusiasm. Young or very sensitive viewers may struggle with scenes of animal peril and a big scary dragon-witch. I'm going to purchase it.

There's one wonderful scene where our heroine, Giselle (Amy Adams), in a messy New York apartment beckons the local critters to help her clean to the tune of ""Happy Working Song"".  Instead of furry woodland creatures the local rodent population comes ahither.  This segment is not only inspired it's downright classic.  As for Adams, a star is born.  She falls into the category of classic girl-next-door wholesomeness.  I saw her before in appreviated turns in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Ricky Bobby"" and she caught my eye but this film suggests somebody who'll command the screen for some time to come.  Good comic turns by James Marsden, Timothy Spall, and Susan Sarandon also enhance the film's appeal.

80152,5,078887148X,"You can get a review of the actual film and plot from various sites so this is just focusing on the DVD release. 'Enchanted' is by far one of the best movies of last year and one of the best Disney films. It's almost like the many spoof movies out there taking on the stereotypes found in Disney movies with the twist of setting the main plot in the 'real' world, though the animated and real world often are competing, showing the differences between what we hold as reality and the idealistic values and plots Disney movies often are founded upon. The fun part of 'Enchanted' is that it really does take a piece from all the classic Disney films such as Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid. Part of the fun is simply identifying what classic Disney film inspired what scene, line or action.

There are some musical numbers in 'Enchanted' and they are what really propels this film to the level of greatness. The producers did a great job of finding out how to get Giselle and Prince Edward singing and dancing in 'our' world with it seeming very cheesy but fun. Unlike many movies, this movie comes with great acting, a good plot, fun musical numbers and an actual message or 'moral of the story' that can be applied to everyone's life. While this is a Disney film and fun for all to watch, I did feel like this was a Disney film best appreciated by young and older adults more so than just children.

As for the DVD, I actually enjoyed watching the special features as much as I did the actual film. There's a feature breaking down the musical numbers, showing how CGI and real animals were used for 'Happy Working Song' and showing how they managed to pull off a musical number in the middle of Central Park in New York. There are bloopers and deleted scenes that add more fun to the film and a few other features that reveal how this film came to be and all the thought and attention put into making this a film that really had a good balance of classic animation (rather than CGI) and real acting. It was all very fascinating and helped the audience understand how special and 'enchanting' this film is.

This is one I'd recommend for everyone to watch. It's hilarious, there are parts that'll bring a tear to your eye, but this movie is one you'll be able to rewatch and it'll still keep you amused and entertained. Definitely worth checking out and buying on DVD.",1206230400,4,2398,4.482837528604119

This, coming from a 38-year old man who really wanted to watch NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but folded to the requests of his wife and 7-year old daughter. ENCHANTED did it all right, with the exception of 1 VERY MINOR thing that I'll get to later.

Too many times, movies with great premises are wasted with hasty rushes to get it to the big screen before everything is in place and things are overlooked or not polished, or not GOOD ENOUGH. With ENCHANTED, the creators actually covered all their bases, and although it wasn't nominated for best picture, it could quite possibly be the most memorable and longest lasting film of the year. Ten years from now, ENCHANTED will still be remembered and watched.

The music was well thought out and oscar-worthy. The story was well-constructed and creative. All the actors were spot on, with special props going out to the UNDERRATED AMY ADAMS. The disney moment dance of the New York City rodents and bugs was fantastic... all the way up to the inevitable end of the roach who thought the pigeon was his new friend.

ENCHANTED, on the surface, is a kids movie, and maybe even a girly kids movie... but, that's just on the surface, because this movie is FOR anybody and EVERYBODY. A brilliantly crafted adventure with laughs, charm and emotion.

The movie is 5 stars. Hands down. So why do I only give it 4 stars? Well, I'm a tough nut to crack... and I found one moment, one single very important moment, a little too quick and unexplained. In the final seconds of the epic battle between Dragon and Chipmunk, even after watching it twice... I'm still not sure why she fell?

80154,5,078887148X,"Absolutely delightful film with a wonderfully quirky premise -- characters from a fairy tale world get thrown into the real world of present-day NYC but still retain their fairy tale world sensibilities and abilities.

It never grows too saccharine and that is a feat all in itself.

Lending some credible weight to the proceedings is the fact that the principal actors do all of their own singing.  No Marni Nixons in sight!

My only complaint about the film is that Susan Sarandon seems a bit lightweight as the evil queen Narissa.  She never seems to relish the role or play it to the full hilt.  In fact, watch her face during the scene where she first arrives in NYC (via a sewer tunnel).  As she rises to street level, she slowly turns around to survey her surroundings.  Problem is, Sarandon looks like she's posing and not acting.  In fact, throughout the whole movie I never really buy her as her character -- she comes off as ""Susan Sarandon doing line readings"".

I like Sarandon, but in this role she doesn't nail it as she could.  Lots of under-utilized potential here.

And the battle with the Narissa/dragon at the climax:  it ends too quickly and abruptly, if I remember.  Lots of ""atmosphere"" in the climax (darkness, rain, thunder, lightning, etc) but very little in the way of thrills or tension, again mostly because it all comes and goes in the blink of an eye.

Aside from the obvious, there's more than a passing reference to ""The Princess Bride"". Patrick Dempsey is fine, and Rachel Covey (as the little girl, Morgan) is excellent. Timothy Spall is sufficiently nasty, and Susan Sarandon as the evil queen acts as if nothing could be more fun. Good songs and rousing musical numbers add to the enjoyment.

80157,5,078887148X,"Giselle (Amy Adams) is your standard, run of the mill animated woman.  Breaks out into song?  Check.  Carries on conversations with animals?  Check.  Dreaming of true love's kiss?  Check.

Prince Edward of Andalasia (James Marsden) is also dreaming of finding his true love.  At the orders of his evil step mother, the queen (Susan Sarandon), he is kept occupied chasing trolls.  That is until one day when he overhears Giselle singing.  Its love at first sight, and the two plan to wed the next day.

Step Mommie Dearest doesn't take this lying down, however.  Disguising herself as an old hag, she pushes Giselle into a ""magic wishing well"" that will really destroy all her dreams by sending her to some place where dreams never come true - New York City.

Meanwhile, there's Robert (Patrick Dempsey).  Robert is a single father living in New York City who is about to propose to his girlfriend of five years.  A divorce lawyer, he is bitter and cynical.

When Giselle and Robert meet accidentally, Robert tries to get out of helping Giselle, but he can't seem to get rid of her.  He can't decide what to make of this strange woman.  And Giselle certainly doesn't get him or the real world.

But Prince Edward isn't taking the disappearance of his sweetheart lying down.  He sets out through the magic well to find Giselle.  As more and more fairytale characters keep coming to our world, what will happen?  Will any of these characters ever be the same again?

This is such a unique film.  It starts out with traditional 2-D animation.  But as the fairytale characters enter New York, they become flesh and blood people.  And that's when the spoofing really starts.

See, the characters expect the rules of their world to apply to ours.  As a result, this movie does spoof certain Disney movie moments (and there are lots of references to those animated movies if you know what to look for).  Yet the movie spoofs the genre in general more then any specific story, which makes things work well.  In fact, one of my favorite moments was Giselle singing ""Happy Little Working Song"" as the animals in Central Park help her clean Robert's apartment.  Yet this movie has its serious moments as it compares real life and fairytales.  It never gets preachy and is very well done.  The plot is fairly predictable, but it is a fairytale, so that's no surprise.

Robert and Giselle, as the two main characters, are the most developed.  The others just aren't given any emotional development.  And that's not a slight against the actors.  Everyone does a great job.  The animated characters are delicious over the top in our world, but it never gets annoying and works well.  The animal characters usually look pretty realistic, but occasionally do look computer animated.  Either way, it never really bothered me.

I wish I could stop here, but I can't.  While this movie doesn't go overboard with them, there are a couple adult references thrown in.  Yes, they are funny.  But they aren't exactly subtle.  They may lead to some questions after the film is over, so be forewarned.

Having said that, this is a movie that parents and kids can certainly enjoy together.  It's got a great theme and plenty of laughs and action.  This movie will entertain anyone who watches it.",1206057600,11,3267,4.729537366548043

In contrast, fairy tale world is a lot more simple, loving and happy world compared to the ""new world"", more complicated, exausting, full of non true love and unhappy living style. A call to reflect about our lives, and to make our living way more loving, spontaneous and expresive of our true emotions. I hope everybody finds a good and possitive message in this movie.

80162,5,078887148X,"This highly recommended film  arrived yesterday from Amazon, and I'm delighted with the speedy delivery!  I hate to state the obvious, but ""Enchanted"" is an enchanting treat for Disney fairy tale aficionadoes. It's already been hailed as ""an instant classic""-- and deservedly so. ""Enchanted"" did extremely well in theatres in late 2007, and it will continue to enchant generations of audiences to come on DVD.
  Evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) transports incadescent Amy Adams as Princess Giselle from the animated world of Andalasia  to real-world NYC. She is quickly followed by her stalwart Prince Edward. James Marsden is earnestly charming as the good-hearted Edward. Giselle, however, is befriended by Patrick Dempsey as  Robert, a  jaded and cynical divorce lawyer and his young daughter--and finds shelter in their apartment. Giselle comes to the real world with her fairy-tale sensibilities intact. Can she bring magic to a bitter and world-weary  NYC and melt Dempsey's hardened heart? The plot outcome may be obvious, but the journey is delightful. The extraordinary thing about this film is how cleverly and affectionately Bill Kelly's script  pays homage to the ""classic Disney Princess""  franchaise of ""Snow White,"" ""Cinderella,"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" (in a nice twist, Adams saves Dempsey from Sarandon's fiery dragon)-- and several other non-Disney family-friendly classic films as well.
  Giselle's journey from a fantasy world to the real-world is Dorothy's journey in ""The Wizard Of Oz"" in reverse. When Giselle runs through a vibrant and lushly green section of Central Park singing ""How Will She Know?""  , the scene recalls Julie Andrews' joyous spin in the mountains at the beginning of ""The Sound Of Music."" Julie Andrews, of course, also starred in the Disney cash cows ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Princess Diaries"", and she is heard here as The Narrator at the beginning and the end. Jodi Benson, voice of Ariel in ""The Little Mermaid""  appears as Dempsey's secretary.  In a scene in Robert's office where Giselle looks at fish in an aquarium, the muzak playing extremely faintly in the background is ""Little Mermaid"" Ariel's theme ""Part Of Your World.""  Paige O'Hara (Belle in ""Beauty and The Beast"") is briefly seen as Prince Edward watches a TV soap opera. Later, when Edward knocks on apartment doors searching for Gieselle, Judy Kuhn (""Pocahontas"") appears as a pregnant lady surrounded by a bunch of kids. She takes one look at Edward in his fairy-tale Prince costume and exclaims, ""You're too late.""
  I've never seen Dempsey in ""Grey's Anatomy"", but with ""Enchanted,"" he is 20 years removed from ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" in which he played a high-school outcast who went ""from Totally Not To Totally HOT.""  In ""Enchanted"", he is HOT once more. Dempsey and Marsden represent two very different types of Prince Charmings, but Amy Adams holds the entire magical enterprise together with her complete sincerity as Princess Giselle.",1205884800,3,2956,5.211416490486258

I liked the fact that Prince Charming, played by James Marsden, appeared briefly on a big city bus, with the Superman logo clearly visible behind him on a billboard sign, of which James starred in Superman Returns. Accident? Whatever.
If you don't catch yourself imitating Amy, with her princess body language, than you are definitely a watcher in life.
There are four real princesses I could find in Amy. 1.)Snow White at the beginning, with getting the critters to round up. 2.) Aurora, with spinning in a penthouse office lobby rug. 3.) Cinderella, with losing her shoe towards the end. 4.) Ariel, for simply looking like her.
Susan Sarandon is extremely campy, with accent on Snow White's evil queen and transformed hag.

80165,4,078887148X,"When initial screenshots and trailers were coming out for ""Enchanted"", my first thought was ""oh lord, what's Disney up to now?"" For the most part, Disney's track record as of late has been spotty with their best releases either being done by Pixar - save Cars, of course - or releases of their well-known films on DVD and Blu-Ray. But with a charming story and a knowing sense of humor, the film is sort of those critic proof films where criticizing it is kind of pointless since this was never meant to be powerful storytelling, just plain fun.

In the animated world of Andalasia, Princess Giselle is to be wed to Prince Edward. But Edward's stepmother Narissa isn't about to give up her throne so easily so she sends Giselle to the real world, more specifically New York. Meeting up with divorce lawyer Robert living with his daughter, Giselle waits till she gets rescued by her Prince while being aware things don't happen the way they should and her resolve to let dreams come true.

The idea of live action and animation blends has been done before. Whether it's combination such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Space Jam and Mary Poppins to transformation like the Pagemaster, the 2 artforms have always been separate save for special projects. Enchanted brings Disney back to 2D after all but abandoning in favor of 3D which hasn't had a lot of success critically and financially except for the Pixar films. What helps the film feel unique is Disney's self-aware humor of the cliches and conventions its used. From the people in love who barely know each other to the helpful animals and characters who can inexplicably sing the song's lyrics despite it being sung for the first time, the film pokes fun at itself but in a more lighthearted way rather than being self-deprecating.

I think many can agree one of the best things about the film is Amy Adams. Always an attractive and insanely likable actress, she actually gives what is basically a parody of typical Disney princesses and gives her depth on occasion while being completely wild-eyed and perky but not irritating. The other notable is James Marsden who basically acts his you-know-what of at being completely outrageous and having fun with the role. And of course to bring in the women is ""McDreamy"" himself Patrick Dempsey as Robert who helps bring that cynical and reality-worn presence to a film bubbling with optimistic characters.

There's not a whole lot of criticisms I can level at the film since it's obviously aimed for family and young kids but there's either too much fantasy and cheeriness or too much in-jokes and references that make it feel more like parody but you're having so much fun anyway you could care less. It even does a twist at the end for its finale of role reversal which I thought worked exceedingly well and people will love cameos such as the voice actors for Belle, Ariel and Pocahontas to the references (the italian restaurant is named Belle Notte, the song performed during the spaghetti scene in ""Lady and the Tramp"").

It's not really classic by any means but it's the kind of family fun that Disney always does so well so those looking for some sugaryness won't find much to be disappointed at here.",1205798400,3,3207,4.7504488330341115
80166,5,078887148X,I just saw this movie today and must say that for a Live Action Disney movie it was wonderful. I like so many others have loved Disney movies since childhood and now in my 20s I am still happy to see Disney's still got it! I have seen Amy Adams in other roles(Junebug) and her character in this movie was very close to the one she played in that movie... which was well... lovely! This is a good movie for all ages!,1205798400,,415,4.073170731707317
80167,4,078887148X,"This movie was a celebration for everyone who loves Disney classics, whether they've seen them so often they've memorized them, or just grew up waiting until the animated features returned to theaters every seven years -- what an event that used to be. Enchanted is such an event.

My family and I went to the theater three separate times to see this film, and every time we noticed new things. This is the best argument ever for buying the DVD. Now, seeing it at home without the spectacle of the big screen, it's possible to focus more closely on the subtleties of the acting, the music, the color and Kevin Lima's expert direction.

Years before he most likely ever dreamed he'd be the director of Enchanted, he remarked on the audio commentary of his first live action feature, 102 Dalmatians, that he took great care when he re-created the Lady and the Tramp spaghetti scene for that film. He said his wish was to stage something that existed in animation but made sense in reality. He more than succeeded with Enchanted, which seems to have not one false note.

That's especially true of the most magical actress of our day, Amy Adams. She brings a Julie Andrews sincerity to her portrayal of Giselle, but adds a deft transformation from animated to real-life in her every movement. The entire film rests on her delicate shoulders. We could just as well have started to find Giselle irritating after a few scenes or repeated viewings. Remarkably, this performance is pitch-perfect.

The DVD looks and sounds wonderful, but I it does make me hope that there will be a special edition someday because I was really looking forward to an audio commentary. The bonus features are quite good, but the pickin's is lean, considering how rich this film is (thus the four stars).

If you get the Blu-Ray version, you not only get a better picture but they've also added an interactive quiz feature about the numerous Disney classic references. Now, if the Blu-Ray had a commentary or two, I'd be asking my wife for a Blu-ray player for my birthday.",1205798400,5,2044,4.714285714285714

80169,4,078887148X,"""Enchanted"", starring Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams, has James Marsden and Susan Sarandon in supporting roles, and Julie Andrews as the Narrator. There are numerous cameo appearances by ""princesses"" and personalities from past Disney films, as well as sight-gags, dialog and other references to - it seems - just about every Disney film ever made.

The film combines classic Disney-style animation with live action, set in New York City; and its clear the writers had alot of fun playing with the classic Disney ""princess"" storyline.

In the animated world, the Evil Queen (Susan Sarandon) realizes that Giselle will destroy her control over her son, the handsome prince (James Marsden), threatening her position as Queen.  She sets out to destroy Giselle by throwing her into the real world - New York City, where our heroine, winds up in our hero Robert Philip's (Patrick Dempsey's) life after he sees and rescues her at his daughter's request when they see her wandering the streets of New York: lost, confused, and desperately trying to get back to her home.

The rest of the film tells how Giselle, in her sweet, wholesome, slightly ditzy, and enchanted way, learns more and more about what reality is.  As the film progresses, you see that her expectations of love are very romantic, perfectionist, and unrealistic - just as Robert Philip's views of love are equally unrealistic - but in the opposite direction: jaded and too willing to accept a relationship (with a long time girlfriend) that just was not going anywhere.

The story is really about how both of them grow up - the film seems to be trying to tell us that Fantasy is good, and fun, but that there is reality too.  Reality may not always be fun, but everyone eventually needs to find a balance between the two.

The film is aimed at pre-teens and their parents, and both will definitely enjoy the experience - it works at many levels, and is full of color, action, song and humor, as well as the before-mentioned references to many past Disney films which will take parents and children alike on a trip down memory lane.

The performances of all the actors are excellent and enjoyable.  Amy Adams, in particular, gave a great performance as Giselle.  The film received an Oscar nomination for music.

Be aware that there is an intensely emotional scene at one point that will fly right over the heads of younger children.  There is also a very intense and somewhat violent sequence at the end of the film which may be unsuitable for very young children.

Even so, I really enjoyed the movie, and - aside for the caveats mentioned above, have no concerns about recommending it for the whole family.

~ The songs are really fun to listen to and to watch! The coreography was wonderfull!

And now the negitive.....

Seeing as how my 4-year-old sister was with me, I think I was being extra cautious about this movie's content.

As far as I can remember, there was no swearing in it.

but....

In a couple scenes things are implied that are inappropiate and in one scene you see Giselle in just a bath towel. There are also some extremely lenghty kisses at the end of this movie.

Also, the wicked Queen turns herself into a old women with a poisened apple, much like the one on Snow white. But the witch was very scary looking, which might make you want to re-consider this one for your younger children.

There is also a semi-scary dragon who chases Giselle.

So.... Overall???? I enjoyed this movie, and know a lot of people who have too. You may have to look over a couple bumps along the way, but overall it's a fairly decent movie, with just a few mishaps.

80173,4,078887148X,"Enchanted, not to be confused with Ella Enchanted, is a delightful movie for young and old alike. The premise is that an evil cartoon witch, Susan Sarandon, expels her daughter-in-law-to-be to a distant realm, New York City, which is not cartoon. There were many ways Disney could have gone with this, but fortunately, for us, they took a rather fun path. What helps make it work is that the princess-to-be retains her magic. For instance, she can sing for the woodland creatures to come and help her. And when such creatures emerge from the sewers and rooftops of NYC, they do help her and she doesn't seem to mind. More than that, the actress herself is able to pull off her own magic. She plays the part perfectly and has you convinced that she was really Snowderella or Sleepunzel. All of the supporting characters give solid performances and everything meshes very nicely.

It's a fun movie. Watch it.",1205452800,,906,4.734177215189874
80174,5,078887148X,"Disney did this one right.  Enchanted is fun-filled family entertainment for children of all ages.  This is a new take on an old fairy tale, where the real world and the animated world collide in, you guessed it, New York City.

This story is Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty and the Beast all rolled into one.  Think hidden cottage in the woods with woodland friends, a heroic rescue, an evil stepmother, a handsome prince, a glass slipper, an old hag, a wishing well, a poisoned apple, a grand waltz, true love's first kiss - you name it, Enchanted has it.  And it all works.

The live action characters are all comfortable and enjoyable in their roles.  Amy Adams is a delight as the beautiful, sweet natured princess, and Susan Sarandon is brilliant as the wicked stepmother.  McDreamy and James Marsden are both very entertaining in their respective roles.  A surprise pleasure is the evil henchman, played by Timothy Spall, fresh from his role as Wormtail in the Harry Potter films. As these real-life animated characters break into song in the middle of Central Park, you find yourself with a smile on your face and a toe tapping foot.  I think I grinned throughout the entire film.

At the start of the film, our princess is living in her small hidden cottage in the woods, where every morning she calls the woodland creatures to help her get dressed and clean up.  On her first morning in NYC, she does the same thing.  Now just imagine what sort of ""creatures"" come to her from the depths of New York City.  I will not spoil it for the viewer, but it is the most cringe-worthy, yet highly entertaining scene in the entire movie.

Any fan of fairytales and/or Disney will love this film.  It is light, fluffy, well done fun.  I highly recommend it.",1205193600,6,1776,4.623003194888179
80175,4,078887148X,"I don't suppose anyone will go into this not having at least a minimal idea of what it is about.  The film begins, of course, as a typical Disney fantasy romance.  A princess awaits her prince, who in this case arrives early in the first reel.  But his evil stepmother, leery of his intention to wed instantly the young maiden, tricks her into falling into a well that transports her to another world, or New York City, as it is otherwise known.  And the cartoonish princess instantly assumes the visage of Amy Adams.

Knowing just that much, anyone with any sense at all of how these things proceed can pretty much guess everything else that happens in the movie.  It would, therefore, be redundant to dwell on any further plot details.  It would also be dishonest to pretend that the film has any hidden depth.  It is what it appears to be, a fun, light-hearted romantic fantasy.  Expect more than that and you'll be disappointed.  Fail to enjoy at least that and . . . well, you just don't know how to have fun.

This film works primarily because the producers did a very, very good thing and cast Amy Adams in the main role.  We BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER fans tend to be a bit possessive and consider anyone who appeared in that show as their own.  Amy appeared in a fairly small role in one of my all time favorite BUFFY episodes, ""Family,"" in which she played Tara's cousin.  I was delighted when a couple of years later she appeared in the first season episode of THE OFFICE, ""The Hot Girl,"" in the title role.  She appeared in a couple of more episodes as Jim's girlfriend (interestingly, both Amy Adams and Jenna Fischer, the objects of Jim's affections on the show, possess many of the same virtues, both physically and personally).  Despite an Oscar nomination for the film JUNEBUG Hollywood for some unfathomable reason failed to provide opportunities for her.  She is talented, immensely likable, and quite beautiful, blessed with a wondrous face and amazing porcelain skin.  After this film I think the public at large has become cognizant of her in a way that they were not before.  I hope that she now lands a long string of first-rate film roles.  She really does deserve to be a major star.

The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  I've never cared for Patrick Dempsey aka McSomething-or-Other on GREY'S ANATOMY, but he was moderately pleasant in this.  I was not aware ahead of time that Timothy Sprall was in this, but the instant I saw the cartoon version of his character I knew that he had to be.  He is one of the best character actors of his day in part because he simply doesn't look like he belongs to this world.  He seems the physical incarnation of a cartoon character.  James Marsters aka Cyclops in the X-MEN movies shows his range as an actor as the unfailingly good-hearted, but insipidly self-impressed Prince Edward.  Idina Menzel has been one of the most successful musical performers on Broadway in the past decade, but has had little success outside of the Great White Way.  This film really didn't take much advantage of her talent.  It would be nice if she got some film roles worthy of her talent.

Disney films have often been filled with self-referentiality and in jokes and this is no exception.  The whole film, of course, could be considered a gloss on SNOW WHITE, CINDERELLA, SLEEPING BEAUTY, and all the rest.  Take the shots of Times Square.  You see billboards for WICKED, which costarred Idina Menzel and was written by ENCHANTED song lyricist Stephen Schwartz.  There are billboards for SUPERMAN RETURNS, in which James Marsters appeared, and the musical HAIRSPRAY, the film version of which featured Marsters.  There were also billboards for RENT, another musical in which Menzel appeared (she reprised the role in the film version).

All in all, I enjoyed it.  It also left me angry that Amy Adams hasn't had more film opportunities.  But I've never understood why some actors get endless opportunities and some get relatively few.  I don't ever remember smiling, let alone laughing, at any moment of any Will Ferrell film, yet he gets one starring film role after another.  I don't get it.  Just as I don't get why Amy Adams isn't one of the most in-demand actors in the world.  Maybe this film will be the one that will change that.",1204934400,4,4292,4.645418326693227
80176,4,078887148X,"""Enchanted"" (2007) has to be one of my favorite Disney movies in years; it is a return to the type of classic movies that were produced under Walt's supervision, but it also acknowledges the times we live in without being too negative. Right off the bat, I was amazed to be able to watch a film that had no profanity and other than the topic of divorce, hardly any adult situations. Of course, there is some 'wink-wink' adult humor that will go over the head of children, but even that is pretty tame. How refreshing to know that an excellent movie can be made without looking like the 10pm news or a tawdry reality show. PLENTY of fun references to vintage Disney films, and a number of cameos by some Disney favorites.

The film begins as a typical classic Disney animated film would; Julie Andrews narrates the story of Prince Edward (James Marsden) from Andalasia, who must find his true love to marry, and his evil stepmother Narissa (Susan Sarandon), who does not want to step down from her throne and will do whatever she can to thwart Edward's search. Enter Giselle (Amy Adams), a maiden of the forest with plenty of animal friends. She too is searching for her true love, and through song and fate, Edward & Giselle meet, fall in love, but are separated by Narissa, who sends Giselle out of the toon world and into the harsh reality of present day New York City. While Edward and Giselle attempt to reunite, a hardened divorce attorney, Robert (Patrick Dempsey) & his daughter attempt to help her along the way. Giselle's positive attitude and belief in true love has a profound effect on Robert, who has apparently been embittered by his own divorce (what actually happened to his first wife is somewhat nebulous, and basically left open for interpretation). Robert is already seeing someone; Nancy (Idina Menzel) is the romantic girl he has been dating for the last five years. No plot spoilers here; you will have to see how it all comes together.

This film rests on the able shoulders of Amy Adams; in the role of Princess Giselle, she could have easily done a parody of Snow White, Cinderella, and the other Disney Princesses. However, she brings warmth, charm, humor, and great emotion to her character; she is totally believeable. James Marsden again shows off his tremendous vocal talent, and as a toon Prince, he gives a letter perfect performance. Although he is a little one-dimensional at times, it works perfectly with the plot and how the movie progresses. Dempsey also does a wonderful job in his role, with just the right amount of bitterness; it is very apparent that he underneath he believes in romance but what happened with #1 has forced him to change. The only weak link in the cast is Sarandon, which is a shame. She is one of our finest actresses, and yet her characterization just misses the mark for me; she lacks the power and evil that we expect from a Disney Villain; in the climax of the film, she almost appears to be yawning through her part. It is the power and force of a Disney Villain that makes their ""fall"" so enjoyable; evil must be very evil for the triumph of good to be truly satisfying. Still, it hardly detracts from the overall product. The songs in this film will stay with you after you watch the movie...in a good way. Rarely have I immediately been overcome with the desire to purchase the soundtrack from a film in recent years. Overall, a definite 5 stars for this movie.

The DVD is a different story; although there are extras, it does seem like Disney skimped on them. The highlight is the behind-the-scenes look, ""FANTASY COMES TO LIVE,"" at 3 sequences: ""Happy Working Song,"" ""That's How You Know,"" and the Ballroom finale sequence. Seeing the layering of the CGI effects and Amy Adams having to ""act"" to nothing (""Happy Working Song"") gives an even greater appreciation of her talent. You will also learn that one of the dancers from ""Mary Poppins"" has a cameo in the ""That's How You Know"" number. There is also an ""extra,"" PIP'S PREDICAMENT: A POP-UP ADVENTURE, that tells the tale of Pip's alerting Edward that Giselle was no longer in Andalasia. MAYBE very young children will find this amusing, but personally, it was a little on the lame side. There is also a ""Hidden Mickey"" that is basically a promotion for the Bluray version of ""Enchanted."" The deleted scenes are fun to watch, as is the blooper reel. Neither are very long though. The Carrie Underwood music video for ""Ever Ever After"" is also included.

I am sure (or at least I hope) there will be a 2-disc special edition in the near future. So, for this 2008 Widescreen edition, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of extras. The movie itself still packs a wallop!",1204848000,56,4705,4.624401913875598

80178,3,078887148X,"Watching ""Enchanted"" reminded me of all the wonderful Disney movies I watched growing up - but there was this cloying, nagging feeling that something didn't quite work in this one. I think the problem was the last twenty minutes. The entire ballroom scene was way too 'staged' and no one seemed in the least bit 'dramatic' - which is weird because they spent the whole film being way too dramatic and hamming their lines every other minute. The last bits played out so weakly that any strengths of the film were automatically undermined, and it became a 3-Star movie in the process.

The first hour though, is superb. The opening animation is 'new and improved' Disney, while retaining an old-world charm. Of course, the lead actress is beautiful (but not too beautiful) and she has a squirelly-bug-eyed charm that is both goofy and infectious. Patrick Dempsey is of course as superb as ever, and James Marsden plays his Prince act with his trademark deadpan expressions (which actually work here). The songs however, didn't quite stand out. No wonder all three song nominations lost out at the Oscars. ""How Will I Know"", which they sing at the park stuck out as being out of tune and extremely irritating.

The standout scene is when Gisele looks out her NYC apartment window and sings out for the 'animals' to help her out. Rodents, cockroaches, bugs soon fill the house - and they actually help her do some work! The audience I saw this with giggled like little girls throughout this extended segment.

""Enchanted"" might go down as a future Disney classic, and it certainly is innovative, but it lacked a certain something for me to give it four or five stars. At the end, and especially after the horrendously boring climax of the dragon-slaying (which ends very suddenly and tepidly), one is left with a sense of 'it could have been so much better'. Disney really pulled out the stops for this one, but it doesn't quite come together.

First of all, I'm a huge Disney nut, so I loved the 60-70 hidden references to the Disney princess films of the past.  There are quite  a few websites that list the references.

So much so that we went back and took Grandad to see it, too and he loved it as well! Amy Adams is perfectly cast as Giselle and Patrick Dempsey acts his part to perfection.

This is a movie that hits all the 'usual' Disney princess fantasy highlights (large production numbers, beautiful costumes, animals, eternal optimism, happy endings). Some of the songs will have you singing for days. Yet, rather unusually for Disney, it manages to make fun of all those Disney classics at the same time as honoring them and it is this element of fun that will keep the whole family watching closely over and over again, competing to see who can spot all the subtle Disney classics references (e.g. Within seconds of hearing the narrator's voice you'll be shouting out, ""That's......."")!!!!!

It is predictable, yet surprising at the same time and the ending is delightfully appropriate and satisfying, in my opinion.

Truthfully, I had been put off by the initial trailers for this movie, which I don't think captured the sense of fun, real-life lessons portrayed or tongue-in-cheek script adequately. There is definitely something for everyone in ""Enchanted"".",1203379200,4,1275,4.8663594470046085
80182,5,078887148X,"Finally, a film that does exactly what it says on the tin. This is truly a fantastic film for all the family. The film begins as a traditional, beautiful Disney animation set in a wonderful fairytale world filled with Princes and Princesses, magic and giants.

After an unfortunate encounter with a giant, Giselle, a lovely young woman meets Prince Edward and in classic fairy tale fashion, the two fall in love and plan to marry the next day. However, Prince Edward's evil stepmother, Queen Narissa, has other ideas and plots to get rid of Giselle, thereby keeping her throne. The moment when she pushes Giselle into a massive magical pit is when the film makes its ingenious transition from animation to live action. Giselle ends up in New York City - as Narissa evilly puts it ""A place where there are no happily ever afters"" - and is lost and alone. She eventually runs into a lawyer played by Patrick Dempsey, and his young daughter who is especially taken with her. Eventually, Prince Edward also ventures to the city to find his true love and after this happens, anything goes.

Amy Adams' performance as Giselle, which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy is a revelation. She shines in every scene that she is in with her wonderfully sweet and funny peformance, which has her singing at random and calling to her animal friends to help tidy up.

The film is an intelligent send up of classic Disney fairy tales as well as a genuinely heartwarming love story and exciting adventure. Children of all ages as well as adults will love this as it really has something for everyone. One of the best films of 2007, if not ever.",1203292800,8,1666,4.640677966101695
80183,5,078887148X,"In ENCHANTED the Walt Disney Company shows that the company does have a sense of humor and parodies itself in a mix of classic animation and live action.  The story begins in the magical, animated world of Giselle (Amy Adams), a beautiful young woman who can talk to animals and has an impressive singing voice. Giselle dreams of meeting a prince.  She meets Prince Edward (James Marsden) one day, the two fall in love, and become engaged to be married.  However, Edward's stepmother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) knows that the marriage will be the beginning of her downfall.  Unbeknownst to Edward and Giselle, Narissa is a witch and casts a spell opening a portal to another world.  On the day of her wedding, Giselle is pushed through this portal and finds herself not in the happy, colorful storybook world, but in the damp, dark, and mean streets of New York City.  Giselle discovers that this ""new"" world is not very nice.  Her fortunes go from bad to worse until she is rescued by a young girl, Morgan (Rachel Covey) and her divorce attorney father, Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey). As Giselle waits for Edward to come and rescue her, she finds herself falling fall for Robert and has to figure out who her true love really is.

I really liked ENCHANTED and it's a fairy tale movie that everyone can find something to enjoy.  Amy Adams shines as Giselle and the movie is worth watching for her performance alone.  For women, the movie has not one, but two handsome men vying for their attention.  Theirs lots of comedy of all sorts, from simple pratfall humor that children will find funny, to quick and witty allusions that only educated adults will understand.

80186,5,078887148X,"Enchanted is the newest wonderful movie from Disney featuring a beautiful princess, a handsome prince, an evil stepmother and a bunch of cute animal characters. And guess what, it's not a cartoon. Oh, it does start out in traditional Disney animation. Princess Giselle has finally found her true love in Prince Edward. They are set to be married, but Queen Narissa is afraid Giselle will steal her kingdom. She devices a plan to banish Gizelle from their cartoon paradise to a place where there is never a ""happily ever after."" Gizelle is pushed down a well and ends up in present day New York City. And this is where the real movie begins.

Robert (Patrick Dempsey from ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"") comes across Giselle and thinks she is crazy, but harmless. At the urging of his daughter, he decides to give her a place to stay and rescue her from herself and New York. Giselle sees Robert's apartment is a mess and uses her ""princess"" powers to summon all the animals of New York City to aid her in singing and cleaning. She also has a great song and dance number in Central Park  Prince Edward (James Marsden) does come to look for Giselle and he is just as out of place in New York as Giselle was. Queen Narissa isn't far behind in her quest to stop him from succeeding.

I loved this movie. Amy Adams was great as Giselle. She has the cartoon princess character down perfectly. James Marsden was great too. Dempsey seemed wooden at times, but my wife loved watching him on the big screen. This movie might be scary at times for the little kids with the climax that includes a battle with a dragon.  This scene almost had to be done to complete the spoof on traditional animated films, but it did take some of the momentum out of the story.

This is a perfect movie for its genre. A rare movie that will capture the imagination of your kids while bringing a smile to the parents' faces. This is the kind of movie that you'll love but you must watch it knowing what kind of movie it is.

80188,4,078887148X,"I'm not one to normally go gaga over a fairytale type film but one this magnificent demands my praises.  `Enchanted' is just as the title would suggest; enchanting.  From open to close is a beautiful and charming adventure that perfectly fuses the cartoon with the live action, never losing its Disney charm.  The plot is not original as one may have hoped and borrows a lot from Disney favorites `Snow White', `Sleeping Beauty' and `Cinderella' but it manages to bolster up its own genuine charm in order to keep us entertained and wanting more.  A lot of this is due to Amy Adams divine performance (so bummed about her Oscar snub), a performance that must have been difficult to acquire yet she wears it so well.

`Enchanted' tells the story of Giselle, a beautiful young girl who dreams (literally) of true loves kiss.  It just so happens that the handsome (and someone empty) Prince Edward is dreaming of the same thing, and when the two meet it's destiny.  The problem though is that Prince Edwards mother Queen Narissa is opposed, strongly, to their love and vows to get rid of Giselle before she weds her son.  With a spell cast and a little push Giselle is sent to out of fairytale land and into our world smack dab in the middle of New York City.  This is when she meets Robert Philip, a big shot divorce lawyer, and his young `princess obsessed' daughter Morgan.  Morgan insists that they help Giselle (the whole scene with Giselle pleading with the billboard sign is laugh-out-loud funny) and so Robert begrudgingly agrees.  Giselle and her fairytale views on love and life clash aggressively with Robert's more mature (according to society) outlook and both of them through the course of the film come to a more balanced understanding.

Prince Edward of course cannot be separated from his true love and so he travels to New York to rescue her.  The evil Queen then sends her servant Nathanial to accompany Edward and make sure that he never reconnects with Giselle.  Giselle's squirrel friend Pip (one of the grandest things about this movie) follows the pair in order to save Giselle from the hands of Nathanial.

The performances from just about everyone are spot on.  Amy Adams is, as I mentioned, devine, truly adorable and inspired.  She manages to perfectly balance the immaturity and campy quality of her fairytale character with the warmth and charm of a true cinematic princess.  Her performance is notches above many praised this year and truly deserved all the attention is received.  Besides, her singing voice is astonishing.  James Marsden was phenomenal as well as Prince Edward.  James Marsden has been an actor on the cuff of greatness for some time now but he's never been able to transcend the stereotype of young actors, never breaking out as anything other than the sidekick, but here he becomes the standout among many.  His `numskull' Edward is utterly hilarious, and the way he smarts off the word `peasants' makes me shiver all over with excitement.

Patrick Dempsey is a little bland for me, but I've never really liked him too much.  I see why some think he's `dreamy' but as far as acting goes he's far from captivating.  My other disappointment was Susan Sarandon, and actress of whom I'm smitten with.  I just really thought she didn't get it here, she didn't know how to ham it up in a good way.  She went way too far over the top and lost everything that could have made her character interesting and her performance fun.  She lacked that balance of camp and charm that Adams and Marsden captured.  In fact it's her debacle of a performance that costs this film a star in my book (well, more like half a star but I can't do that here).  I loved this movie, but she killed part of it for me.

That said though I can't deny the fact that `Enchanted' works beautifully for me and I will surely own this movie and watch it time and time again.  I recommend this to anyone with a healthy imagination desiring to see a film that will dazzle you and make you remember why you love fairytales to begin with.",1201478400,,4045,4.6455696202531644

Her being so ""pure"" and singing wherever she went or making dresses overnight from curtains, her prince coming and singing, the chipmunk, it was not only cute, but clever and funny.

80191,5,078887148X,"In these modern days of Disney animation, who would have thought anything short of Pixar could save them. And word is that Pixar actually did collaborate with Disney on this film. Whatever the cause, the effect is stellar. All the right ingredients went into this film, and to complete the analogy, it was baked at just the right temperature.

ACTORS: Amy Adams perfectly captures what the Disney princess is all about, with her winning, sometimes-naive charm. James Marsdan finds no trouble portraying the handsome-heroic-and-knows-it Prince Edward, while Patrick Dempsey fits the bill of ""everyday hero"" quite well. Susan Sarandon also exemplifies the antagonist, sounding almost like Eleanor Audley, the classic Disney ""evil villainess"" voice (Evil Stepmother, Maleficent, etc). And you already know the gist of the plot; fairy tale princess gets sent to the real world and has culture shock times ten.

What really makes the movie so fantastic is the way those two worlds blend.

PLOT: Watching these characters step out of the far fields of fantasy and encounter the ""real world"" is simply magical, whether it be the exaggerated heroism of Prince Edward in stabbing the ""metal monster"" bus, or the tender bewilderment of Giselle at feeling anger for the first time. Yet, the blend is not one-sided. Going in, I assumed fantasy would be handled as the current trend in movies so often is - getting its butt kicked by reality to the refrain of a needle abruptly sliding off a record.

But instead, a little bit of pixie dust goes a long way, and the gilded gleam of fantasy holds steady against the culture shock of real life; even winning out in some cases. The mix (and transformations) are enchanting, showing it's not just the fantasy characters who need to ""grow up""; fairy tales have something to teach us too. Just as the real world forces Giselle to undergo a maturation process without completely discarding her princessy ways, fantasy helps Robert learn to believe in love again, and brings out his humanity without leaving him in euphoric naivet.

This isn't just fantasy meets reality. This is past meets present. This is the spirit of childhood meets the realities of being grown-up. And it's a stroke of genius to forge this connection. Disney clearly recognizes that times are changing, and that in contemporary cinema - and in the culture overall - the era of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty is all but gone. But instead of permitting parody (brought on largely by Dreamworks' ""Shrek"") to sweep fantasy away utterly, Disney blends the two together, to ease the transition and, hopefully, to preserve the past.

And the past is certainly worth preserving. I was impressed by the exhibitions of honor in the film. For example, When extending compassion to the rain-soaked princess, Robert allows her to come to his apartment. When she falls asleep on his couch, he reluctantly permits her to remain...and informs his daughter she'll be sleeping in his bed, to avoid the obvious implications of having a strange woman sleeping in his apartment. (Not all princes wear cloaks and carry swords.) Honor among men is not a quality oft-exhibited in modern cinema any more; it was practically a thrill to see it in Enchanted.

Likewise, the unselfishness of the main characters also stood out. When Prince Edward makes his debut, he seems first to be the self-obsessed narcissist reflected in parodies like Shrek 2 (IE, hair net under the helmet to preserve those golden curls.) But when it comes down to it, Edward sacrifices his own love for the happiness of the Giselle. When his kiss cannot break the spell, his desire to see Giselle saved overcomes every other thought, and he insists that Robert kiss her. Similarly, Nancy sacrifices what she thought was her dream, not just by permitting but by insisting that Robert kiss Giselle.

The movie works wonderfully for youngsters, with just a tinge of spook as all classic Disney movies have. But on a higher level, adults can identify too. Like the film, members of the Disney generation (or any generation) have had to grow out of their simple, ideal world and meet full-on all the joys and pains of the ""real world."" This movie is a wonderful melding the two.

MUSIC: The music too hearkens back to Disney's grander days. The smashing compositions of Alan Menken and lyrics of Stephen Schwartz (the two collaborated on The Hunchback of Notre Dame) are appropriately cheerful, perky or sentimental as the situation requires. Additionally, James Marsdan and Amy Adams do their own singing - and excel beautifully.

Watching this movie was like being reunited with an old friend whom you haven't seen in so long that you've nearly forgotten he exists. Let's admit it, most of us grew up on the Disney classics like Peter Pan, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. And let's also admit that, while shades of those Disney memories existed in the sequels and prequels and threequels that Disney has been mass-producing (falsely believing that the characters were what made the classics so grand), it wasn't the same. But Enchanted represents a return to the glory days.

Thanks, Disney, for refreshing old memories and the chance to make some new ones.

Walt would be proud.",1200873600,6,5225,4.972508591065292
80192,5,078887148X,"Leave your cynicism outside the theater and enjoy ""Enchanted,"" starring the talented Amy Adams.  She is captivating as Giselle, the lovely, wholesome, and nave young woman who is convinced that all she needs to make her life complete is her one true love.  Alas, Prince Edward, aka ""Prince Charming,"" has a rather unpleasant stepmother, Queen Narissa, played with raucous glee by Susan Sarandon.  Narissa wants to thwart the lovers so that she can keep the throne for herself.  She hatches a diabolical scheme in which she sends Giselle to a far-off place where innocent people are eaten for lunch--New York City.

""Enchanted"" adheres to the conventions of the ""fish out of water"" genre, which was used successfully in such films as ""Elf"" and ""Splash.""  Giselle emerges from a manhole wearing her tiara and an ornate wedding gown.  Luckily for her, she runs into a kindhearted divorce lawyer, Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), who is bewildered and bewitched by this strange creature.  Besides having a ridiculously optimistic outlook on life and a sickeningly sweet disposition, Giselle has a way with animals (including rats, pigeons, and cockroaches--this is New York, after all) who help her clean house and run errands.  Robert's daughter, Morgan, is soon smitten with Giselle; this sweet and pretty lady represents everything that a little girl dreams of in a mother.  Robert's girlfriend, Nancy, who has a more down-to-earth and practical disposition than Giselle, is less than entranced by this interloper whom she senses may be a rival for Robert's affection.

The director, Kevin Lima, wisely encouraged his performers to play their parts straight, with nary a wink at the audience.  Bill Kelly's witty screenplay pokes fun at such fairy tale clichs as the wicked stepmother with her arsenal of poisoned apples and the plastic, square-jawed prince gallantly wooing his fair damsel.  Among the many amusing visuals:  Giselle uses curtains and other fabrics that she finds in Robert's house to make cutesy, off-the-shoulder dresses; a chipmunk accompanies Giselle to New York and keeps popping up in odd locations to warn her of the danger that she's in; Giselle strolls in Central Park with Robert and everyone bursts out in merry song.

Amy Adams is adorable as she tries to adjust to an urban environment as well as the realities of modern romance.  James Marsden is an appropriately vapid Prince Edward and Susan Sarandon camps it up as the vicious queen.  The gorgeous Patrick Dempsey nicely evolves from a bitter realist to a man falling under the spell of a beautiful and soft-hearted woman.  The music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz are charming, and the animation is effectively eye-catching.  ""Enchanted"" is great fun.

The twist behind ""Enchanted"" is pretty catchy: what happens when the artificial sweetener of your average Disney-animated princess movie is flung tiara-first into The Real World?  Giselle, the impossibly wide-eyed heroine of Andalasia, accomplishes all of her daily chores with the aid of helpful woodland creatures, and most of her woes are washed away just by singing a song.  Stick her in present-day New York, though, and she's just another passing weirdo, although with better hair and skin.

Writer Bill Kelly has tried the fish-out-of-water scheme before (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blast-From-the-Past/dp/0780626494/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blast From the Past</a>) with mixed results.

The guy has some intriguing ideas, I'll grant him that, but his execution needs serious work.

With ""Enchanted,"" he's come closest to hitting his mark.  The syrupy-silly sensibility of the movie is perfect for catering to kids, and although there are a few hide-behind-mom's-elbow moments, they're not really any worse than the things you might catch in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty/dp/B00005JKHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bambi/dp/B000OJ3WLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bambi</a>.  Giant trolls, evil sorceresses, and blood-thirsty dragons.  Considering the bulk of the flick takes place in the Big Apple, it's not so disturbing to find out that at least three of the littler apples are poisoned.

The only real problem with the film is its inconsistency, its many pulled punches.  Giselle is played with almost annoying perfection by Amy Adams; her princess-to-be is so floofy and precious that she is suitably grating, and at the start of the film, most of the people who meet her think she's four sheets to the wind.  This includes Robert (Patrick Dempsey), the divorce lawyer who has the (mis?)fortune to save her from having to spend a night on the streets.  There's a fantastic bit when Giselle awakens in the morning to Robert's sty of an apartment; in true Disney-land fashion, Giselle calls for help from New York's resident wildlife, and she cleans the place with a cadre of roaches, rats, and pigeons.

This stuff is spot on, but the spots start moving.  As Giselle moves through the film, New York responds to her less and less like the ""real world"" of the tagline, and more and more like Disney's hoped-for version of a big, crazy town.  Robert starts the movie suitably annoyed and weirded out by Giselle's crazy antics (she ruins his drapes, puts him on the outs with his girlfriend of five years, and disrupts his business practice), but -- with very little coaxing at all -- in the next scene he's glibly accepting the grand, spontaneous musical numbers and Giselle's unsettling ability to get random birds to do her bidding.  Keep the musical numbers, by all means, and leave in her Dolittle panache, of course.  That's half of the recipie, right?  So where's the ""real world"" I was promised?

It fades away fast.  The movie starts out as a cute, tongue-in-cheek self-satire of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White/dp/0736421866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White</a>&nbsp;formula, but then it quickly decays into a (still very) cute (but also blase) embrace of the very thing it was riffing on.  The irony, after all, is the richest thing about the premise.  By the time Giselle and Robert fall in love with each other (just because they're supposed to, it seems), the only ironic thing about the movie is that it apparantly just duped itself.

It's a great kid's flick, don't get me wrong, but it's not exactly what it wants to be, which is too bad, because its aspirations are pretty fun.  Watching the honey-bright Adams sing to tub-scrubbing roaches is a treat in itself.  I get the feeling, though, that at the end of the movie, if Giselle had sung her trademark ""come hither"" warble, she would've been greeted by cuddly bears and squeaky-voice fawns, instead of scuzzy rats and birds.  It's too bad; without the scuzz, this is just another fairy tale.",1200873600,10,4519,5.785498489425982
80194,5,078887148X,"Enchanted was such a delightful movie that we have seen it twice at the theatre, and can't wait for it to come out on video!

What would happen if all of the typical characters in a Disney fairy tale (the heroine, the prince, the wicked witch, the bumbling servent, and even the cute animals with whom the heroine communes) suddenly found themselves in real life in current-day New York City?

That's the premise of Enchanted, and it does it amazingly well. And it is delightful to see Disney lampooning all of its own stereotypical ideals!

First, to be clear - the characters become real as they arrive in New York - this is not animation interacting with real life, ala Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but rather the animated characters become real. Thus the heroine, once arriving in New York, is played by Amy Adams, the prince by James Marsden, and the wicked step-mother witch queen (yes, all in one) by the always-wonderful Susan Sarendon.

Heroine Giselle is sent to the real world by Prince Edward's (Marsden) wicked step-mother queen (Sarendon) on her wedding day, because Sarendon does not want to lose her position as queen of the throne. She emerges through a manhole in Times Square, and after a series of mishaps is befriended by way-too-practical-and-cynical lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey).

Prince Edward, played to perfection by Marsden as a sincere, but slightly vapid prince, follows to rescue his love. He is, in turn, followed by the queen's doting and dopey henchman, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and Giselle's equally doting chipmonk, voiced by both Jeff Bennett and Kevin Lima.

Just about the only scenes which are even remotely of concern in this very feel-good movie are when, in a scene where heroine Giselle is having pigeons, mice, and cockroaches clean Robert's apartment, one of the pigeons unexpectedly suddenly gobbles one of the cockroaches, and a scene where Morgan tells Giselle that ""you know that they say, boys are only interested in one thing."" Even there, when Giselle, in all wide-eyed innocence says ""What's that?"", Morgan responds ""I don't know, nobody will tell me.""

There are also several scenes which find chipmonk Pip to almost be in peril - but only almost (although there is a visual of a sword held at his throat - also there is a scene where a sword is plunged into a bus - because Prince Edward believes it to be a horrible beast).

It should also be said however, that the climactic ending may be too intense for younger children - it is very reminiscent of the scene at the end of Ghostbusters when they are battling Zuul on the roof.

All in all, Enchanted far exceeded all of our expectations, and we cannot recommend it highly enough.

80195,4,078887148X,"Enchanted is obviously a holiday movie. With magic spells and ""a prince who doesn't know the truth until page 70"", they are all classic Disney moments and plot lines for an all-out holiday production.

What makes enchanted enchanting is the merge of two worlds - a long missed hand drawn animation world and a rough cold New York reality. They are so far apart that their clashes made the movie funny to watch. The movie played on the sudden singing in animations but brought them into the real world, where, people were either enthralled or pushed away.

Amy Adams did a great job as Giselle, the animated princess turned human who is waiting for her Prince Edward (James Marsden) to save her from the concrete jungle. It's a concrete jungle, so the hollow tree house became an apartment in a building block of Robert (Patrick Dempsey). However that didn't stop Giselle from singing and mobilising...em...""the NY rodents"" to do the unbelievable - cleaning up the apartment. Amy manages to impersonate every move that her animated alter ego does and that makes it unbelievably watchable. And her out of place tone of voice full of passion and optimism just completely put her in a weird position in the NY city. However, as the story progresses that kind of charm was lost gradually, which made the last 30 minutes of the movie a bit of a drag.

Patrick Dempsey is fit for purpose but James Marsden does a hilarious job as compared to the all too serious Cyclops in X-men a while ago. He seems to be getting good regular appearances in interesting productions like Hairspray and Superman Returns nowadays. James proved that he is versatile actor who is not afraid to screw up his face for a role. As compared to him Patrick Dempsey is a bit lukewarm despite he is a total fit for the role. It probably is not his problem but more of the roles he got. Dr. McDreamy is too deep rooted to get him out of that frame.

As mentioned the last 30 minutes was more of a drag but the short appearance of Susan Saradon as the wicked step mother did spice things up. Unfortunately it was a bit too short.

The scores of the movie were beautifully written and it was interesting to see how the Disney style song played out in the Central Park.

All in all, it is a very enjoyable movie but that's that. So don't expect anything classic but just a good night out (or good night in when it is out on DVD).",1200182400,,2390,4.4953917050691246
80196,5,078887148X,This is such a breath taking movie and so well made. And this is a good movie for all ages in everyones opinion. So if you want to see a good movie add this one to your shopping list because this is the best fairytale movie ever filmed.,1199750400,,236,3.9375
80197,5,078887148X,"Sometimes a movie hits just the right notes (especially a musical), and is released at just the right time - that it is on its way to massive box office returns by the first day of release. Disney's ""Enchanted"" is such a movie. The last time a movie was so perfectly timed, and of such high quality, might have been Francis Ford Coppolla's ""Apocalypse Now"". This is not to say in any way, of course, that ""Enchanted"" has anything in common with ""Apocalypse Now""... wait. Hold on. Now that I think about it - they have so much in common.

Apocalypse Now documents the shattering of a country and the two male leads (Brando and Emilio Estevez's dad) through the Vietnam War, a complete upheaval that sucks up everything in its path and spits it out again all broken and battered, or just plain dead. Lots of folks end up waking up dead in ""Apocalypse Now"". Enchanted is a kind of apocalypse, too- a potentially life shattering event for a cartoon princess in which the heroine could well find herself waking up dead! Great stories are about watching interesting characters go through changes. The more intense and cinematic the change, the better! Few films have come close to the shattering images in Apocalypse Now, for example the image of Marlon Brando making a million dollars a minute for his fairly average performance is hard to forget. Much like the disturbing and artsy images from Coppolla's violence-fest, Disney's ""Enchanted"" has equal number of bright, happy, and sometimes ""ewwwww!"" inspiring moments to match.

While helicopters thump and whirr overhead and shriek across village's blowing them to bits in Coppola's helo homage, Amy Adams twitters and flits and bobs and dances and smiles her way into almost every viewer's heart in ""Enchanted"". Met with almost universal affection from viewers and pointy headed critics alike, There are exceptions, of course. These folks can find help easily. Some folks just haven't got any joy. One unhappy reviewer even suggests that ""...the movie becomes pedantic and predictable, proceeding from fanciful to boring in about ten minutes flat."" So wrong. So sad. So many people scratch their heads and wonder aloud about critics - how they can appear in print when they are so often utterly mistaken or deluded in their grasp of art and the artists who perpetrate it!? The value of critics and criticism is outside the purview of this particular post; needless to say, most critics have little merit. A by-line doesn't make one insightful. However, even the most clueless of critics can have moments of accuracy. Roger Ebert, for example, so notorious for being so wrong, so often, is favorable to the movie. So, where critics are concerned, fantasies can come true! [For a great illustration of how deeply confused most critics are take a look at their utterly pathetic wrong misinterpretations of ""Running With Scissors"". A superb and disturbing movie almost completely misunderstood by critics.]

""Apocalypse Now"" has Martin Sheen, while ""Enchanted"" has the by far more talented and lovely Amy Adams. Both films were just right for the times in which they were released, both were box office hits and critically acclaimed (not that that matters). It was the right time in 1979 for Coppolla's movie. It was right for him-he needed money for his vineyard and winery, and he got it. It was right for the movie-going public-folks were ready for a serious artistic review of the Vietnam War. Apocalypse Now was there when it was needed and wanted. In a sense it provided a service. Now, folks are ready for a more whimsical tour de force. ""Enchanted"" is perfectly timed, and has just the right mix of charm, humor, drama, action, music, and romance. This is the combination that America needs now. And boy do we need it bad!

Some will say, including me, that ""Enchanted"" may be the best Disney movie since Julie Andrews' stole America's hearts in with her attitude heavy portrayal of Mary Poppins. The country is ready for ""Enchanted"" - America now has more than enough real apocalyptic activity going on right about now what with the vanquishing of evil, mysogonist, reactionary, cruel and heartless, self-aggrandizing Islamists over in Iraq and Afghanistan and on our own shores currently underway. ""Enchanted"" is a much deserved break from the harsh realities of our lives. And its timing couldn't be better.

The foundation of good drama, good art is watching folks change. The more change, the more real the change, the better! What could be more traumatic to watch (other than repeated viewings of Rocky Horror Picture Show) than a lovely cartoon princess being thrown into the real-life (at least from her perspective) bizarre, shocking, and dirty world of current day Times Square? Not much! That is exactly the predicament sweet Princess Giselle finds herself in. But she handles this existential change not by being shattered or violently blowing things up, but by handling herself with panache, positivity, music, and meeting new animal friends! Princess Giselle then has to fight Susan Sarandon, of all the horrors the film makers could throw at the young lass, did they have to be so cruel as that? Well, yes. And despite Ms. Sarandon's lack of ""clue"", the ensuing conflict works. Princess Giselle grows into a perfectly decent, always stunning and talented New York gal of the current day. Patrick Dempsey of Grey's Anatomy is lucky enough to find her wandering in the rain in Times Square and takes her home so that his five year old girl can explain how life really works to him. Male leads in Disney films are often incredibly daft. And over time, we see Dempsey change and grow and learn that his cynical approach to life can be quickly overturned when the right princess is dropped in his life to muck up his very tight schedule, which doesn't include cleaning his very expensive west side apartment. All the leads are quite good except for Sarandon whose obvious obsession with Frank N. Furter leads her far far astray.

While a critic (not me, of course) could readily blame the director for allowing Ms. Sarandon to so muck up her role, it's more fun to directly heap criticism upon her. But it's not all bad with Ms. Sarandon. Taking a much needed break from her seeming endless agitprop silliness Ms. Sarandon may well have put her most memorable role on celluloid with this movie. A small hint regarding her questionable performance can be found in a recent interview in which she says that she never was really ""into"" the princess thing and doesn't really understand why so many little girls are so intrigued by them. In answering the question ""Why do you think the princesses still resonate with a new generation of girls today?"" Ms. Sarandon uses the term ""I don't know"" four times. Clearly, she is being honest. Looking a cross between Norma Desmond and Rocky Horror's FrankNFurter, Ms. Sarandon is so far over the top that the plummet to the bottom of the fountain for Giselle is but a quick dip compared to the endless millenia it will take for Sarandon's Princess Narissa to fall her own distance to bottom.

""Apocalypse Now"" had helicopters spitting fire from on high, ""Enchanted"" has a dragon doing the same. Both are scary in some primal way. But as our helicopters were silent during the release of ""Apocalypse Now"" - they are very much in action again today. Now is the time for ""Enchanted"" with it's personal upheavals and battles and profound multiple apocalypses for a battle and war weary public.

This is not an anti-war film by any stretch, it recognizes as so many in our country do not, that there are times when force and evil must be met with an overwhelming force response so that the princess and the kingdom can be preserved. Believing that our enemies will desist in their evil because we request them to do so, or because we hope they will, or because we apologize to them is more a fantasy than anything in ""Enchanted"".",1199577600,2,7923,4.855029585798817
80198,5,078887148X,"As a young girl, I grew up with Disney fairy tales where the princesses found their princes and lived happily ever after.  Of course, reality is that it is a cruel world and you may not find that happily ever after or your true love.  In Enchanted, Giselle does find her true love in the fairy tale but is sent to the evil, cruel reality called New York City by her evil stepmother-to-be who is afraid that Giselle will take over being queen.  She gets lost in the real world and is helped by a single father, Robert who has a 6 year old daughter, Morgan, and who doesn't believe in fairy tales.  While waiting for her prince to come rescue her she falls in love with Robert and Morgan and vice versa.  In this time, the evil stepmother also has sent someone to kill Giselle and eventually has to come to do the deed herself.  In the end, who is Giselle meant to be with? Is it the Prince from her fairytale world or the one she has just met in the real world?  Is a happily ever after possible?

I would have to say that anyone who grew up listening to the fairytales would love this tale.  It gives hope to all that are still looking for their true love and their happily ever after.  Sometimes it is where you least expect it.

The cast is excellent with Amy Adams playing Giselle, James Marsden as Prince Edward, Patrick Dempsey as Robert, and Susan Surandon as the wicked stepmother.  I like how it incorporated different aspects of the fairy tales that I grew up with such as my prince will come, cinderella calling on the animals to help clean and sew, the evil step mother, etc.  This is definitely on my to buy list when it comes on dvd.",1199145600,5,1646,4.2709677419354835
80199,5,078887148X,"Enchanted is about as clever a film as was released in 2007. This witty, lovable satire on the conventional fairy tale brings not only lots of laughs with it, but also warmth, charm, and a good natured sensibility that reels you in from the beginning.

When a jealous queen tricks her son's beloved into going through a portal to the real world,  the young fairy tale maiden manages to touch not only the hearts of the jaded single lawyer and his daughter who come to her rescue, but our hearts as well. She has that sickeningly sweet demeanor that fits in her world, but seems foolish and whimsical to our cynical eyes. But she's a survivor, which is something real world people can relate to, and her pluck and determination make her someone to root her and not despise.

Amy Adams gives a wonderful performance as the maiden, as does Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, James Marsters as the dashing prince, and Dr. McDreamy himself, Patrick Dempsey, is perfectly modulated as the hapless good samaritan who gets a lot more than he bargained for by coming to the woman's rescue.

Enchanted works on many levels, but if nothing else, it works as a nice tale in a world where people desperately want to believe that it's possible for someone to live happily ever after.",1198713600,4,1268,4.622222222222222

She is like a walking cartoon character in the beginning of the picture, but she allows some subtler shadings of emotion to creep into her character as she is affected by our world and the single father and daughter (Patrick Dempsey and Rachel Covey) she meets here.

Still, I have to say I left the theater less than enchanted.

I won't waste your time explaining the plot, which has been extensively covered in all the previous reviews.

The first two-thirds of the movie really are charming. Amy Adams has an extraordinary voice and plays the wide-eyed Giselle perfectly.  If Heidi Klum is a faultless, real-life Jessica Rabbit, then Amy Adams gives life to a multitude of Disney Princesses.  There is an extended musical interlude that has Giselle overcoming the famous (or notorious) New York cynicism in a song and dance number that includes romancing senior citizens, a country-western street minstrel (which I think would have really been hilarious, and more authentic, if the movie could have included New York's celebrated ""Naked Cowboy"") a Reggae Band, Mariachi Band and about a thousand Rockettes dressed as Bride and Groom.  It's really the best part of the movie (for fans of musicals) and it prompted applause from me, my family and our fellow theater-goers.  James Marsden (of X-Men and Hairspray fame) is rapidly becoming to the 21st century what Val Kilmer was to the 80's.  I personally think, like Val Kilmer, the depth of his talent is vastly underrated, though time may (I hope) prove me wrong.  Marsden can sing, dance, and, when the script calls for it, actually act.  Susan Sarandon is mostly only heard and even when seen is quickly CGI'ed into a large, though strangely un-threatening, dragon.  That's too bad, because in her all-to-brief appearance as the in-the-flesh evil stepmother, she proves that she can still be a sexy vixen.  But maybe that's just my age showing.

It was the resolution of the plot that disappointed me and, if I hadn't known better, it looked like the writers had to quickly end this movie and join the striking picket lines, abandoning several threads that could have made for a more interesting and honest ending.

At the risk of spoiling the ending (if you haven't seen the movie yet - stop reading now) let me explain.

Prince Edward has already ceded over to Robert (played by New York leading man stereotype Patrick Dempsey) the fact that he is not Giselle's ""one true love.""  He's then betrayed by his stepmother, who then tries to kill everyone - and I do mean everyone.

When the evil Queen finally morphs into the dragon, she leaves the Prince's sword planted in the ballroom floor, seizes Robert and climbs to the top of a skyscraper roughly the size of the Empire State Building.

So who seizes the sword and saves Robert?  Before you answer, consider:  Prince Edward is the perfect representation of a Disney Prince.  He's brave (he's spent almost his entire life capturing seven-story-tall ogres,) noble (he's just handed over the only love he's ever known to a total stranger in order to save her life,) and unafraid of taking action when the situation calls for it (forget stabbing a New York bus - he's just faced down his own mother and toppled her from the rule of Anadalusia.)  Is such a man going to stand by while a mere wisp of a girl, one for whom he's sacrificed so much, takes on a gigantic dragon?

Not likely.

So I propose an alternative.

Giselle, seeing her One True Love in mortal danger, leaps forward and struggles to pull the sword from the ballroom floor.  However, seeing as how it's been planted by a giant dragon, cannot set it free.  Edward, obviously struggling with his own tragic circumstance, sees her and, mustering a lifetime of courage, casts aside concern for himself, gently pushes Giselle to one side, and effortlessly pulls the sword from the stone.  Sorry - another Disney movie reference - Edward effortlessly pulls the sword from the floor.

He attacks the dragon but, despite his best efforts, is unable to overcome it alone.  Robert, who up to this point has been a passive, almost metrosexual, bystander to the events that are determining his own life, is inspired by Edward's example.  He overcomes his own fear and together, Edward and Robert, they defeat the dragon.  A manly handshake ensues.

Edward presents Robert to Giselle, thus completing the bridge between the fantasy world of Andalusia and the gritty streets of Manhattan.  Angie, Robert's theoretical fiance (played by Samantha Ivers) is truly the under appreciated tragic figure in this story.  However, she is swept away by the depth of Edwards courage, nobility, and romance.  She rewards him with a kiss and they both discover that they are each other's One True Love.

Robert weds Giselle, Edward weds Angie, and the wicked queen's former toady, Nathaniel (played by Timothy Spall) goes on to be a best-selling author.

We, the audience, have now found a new respect for the characters of Edward, Robert and Angie.  They've overcome their heartbreaking circumstances and grown.  Real literary stuff.

I thought all that up while sitting in my seat watching the credits scroll up the screen.

So I wasn't entirely satisfied by the ending.  ""Enchanted"" is still a good, though not great, movie and, as directed by my own 11-year-old-princess, I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.",1197763200,6,5363,4.859030837004405

""Enchanted"", the new film from Disney, featuring a mix of live action and animation, is almost the perfect entertainment for your family this holiday season. A tongue-in-cheek look at the rich history of animation at the studio combines with an over-the-top live action musical set in New York to create a film just about everyone in your family should enjoy.

Giselle (Amy Adams, ""Junebug"") is the quintessential Disney heroine. She lives in a quaint cottage in the forest and sings to her animal friends as she dreams of the prince she will one day meet. As she dreams of this man, making a mannequin of him, Prince Edward (James Marsden, ""X-Men""), the quintessential Disney hero, gallops through the forest hunting trolls, with his sidekick Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) close at hand. The two meet and this instantly causes the wicked Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), who is, you guessed it, the quintessential Disney villain, to become concerned she might lose control of her kingdom, Andalasia. As Edward's step-mother, she would lose her throne as soon as he marries his one true love. She disguises herself as an old crone and lures Giselle to a wishing well. The queen pushes the young lady in and Giselle falls through before finding herself in New York City. Soon, the Prince learns his one-true love is gone and follows her. In New York, Giselle meets Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce attorney and single dad of Morgan (Rachel Covey). Morgan, is, of course, captivated by a real-life princess.  (Disney Marketing Team alert: Add Giselle to the Disney Princess Line of merchandise!!!!) Robert is more skeptical. Giselle ends up staying with them as Robert tries to help her get back to her country. This makes his long-time fianc&eacute;e, Nancy (Idina Menzel, Broadway's ""Wicked"") nervous about their relationship. Queen Narissa becomes concerned about Giselle's whereabouts and sends her henchman, Nathaniel back to New York as well. Unhappy with the progress, she soon decides to go to the Big Apple and take matters into her own hands.

Directed by Kevin Lima (""Tarzan""), ""Enchanted"" is a fun film to watch, but it isn't one of the best films you will ever see. Then again, it isn't one of the worst either. As the film progresses, the quality of the story and the acting become a little uneven, marring the quality a bit.

The film begins in the animated world of Andalasia. Everything in this portion of the film is pitch perfect. From our initial encounter with Giselle, as she sings to the animals in a very ""Snow White"" like sequence, to the first appearance of the incredibly handsome Prince Edward, who spends every waking moment hunting trolls, the tone and feel of classic Disney animation is captured and presented in a way to poke light fun at it. As soon as the two meet, they decide to marry. The next day. Giselle makes her own dress with the help of her forest friends and arrives in a very- Cinderella like coach. The animation is also very nice and compliments the tone of these segments very well. You almost forget the film will soon thrust us into modern-day New York, leaving this world behind.

As soon as Giselle arrives in Times Square, she takes on the looks of Amy Adams. Adams appeared in ""June Bug"", an independent film released a few years ago. In that film, a very pregnant Adams stole the show as Benjamin McKenzie's (who? He was the star of TV's ""The O.C."") pregnant wife. It was a delightful performance and she continues to show that quality in Giselle. As the princess-to-be stuck in New York, she has a wide-eyed innocence perfectly capturing the naivety of an animated princess. Living in an insular world, she naturally assumes New York is just like Andalasia. She doesn't understand that it isn't and doesn't understand why it can't be, so she is determined to bring her Andalasia way of thinking to the mean, gritty streets of New York.

It is a funny, delightful and perfect performance for the role.

In New York, she meets Robert (Dempsey). As Robert is an adult living in the real world, he doesn't have the same misconceptions about life in New York and is very reluctant to enter Giselle's dream world. Robert eventually has enough of Giselle's fantasies, washes his hands of her, and sends her on her way in Central Park. He quickly realizes she will never make it on her own and rejoins her. As they walk through Central Park, Giselle quickly attracts a following and they break out into song, using the sounds and rhythms of New York, the group cavorts throughout the park. Throughout, Dempsey has to remain skeptical, but at the same time show some emotion, any emotion, to make his character human, so it is a strange performance. It is difficult to see the shades of gray (no pun intended) in his performance. He is either smitten with Giselle's innocence, or determined to maintain his steely New York reserve.

Naturally, he has to, at some point fall in love with her. I think Dempsey and the filmmakers try to make this seem like a gradual thing by showing us the two sides to this character, flipping back and forth between them. But this only serves to make his character seem a little uninteresting. Because these are the only two facets to his character, we need more to make him seem more human.

It doesn't help that Robert is in a relationship with Nancy (Idina Menzel). I think the filmmakers are trying to portray their relationship as ""modern"" - they have been together seven years, yet never married. But Nancy just puts up with it, until she finds Giselle in Robert's arms. Her character just isn't interesting enough to hold our interest.

James Marsden plays Prince Edward and he is pretty much pitch perfect as well. In the animated sequences, Edward is the type of blowhard nincompoop you would expect in a Disney film - think Gaston in ""Beauty and the Beast"". Edward is very nice, but full of himself. When he meets Giselle, per fairy tale law, they immediately decide to marry the next day. They have, after all, met ""True Love's Kiss"", which is the name of the song they each sing separately leading them to meet. When Edward follows Giselle to New York, to bring her home, his attitude doesn't change at all, but his environment does. He is now in New York City and has to deal with all that entails. But, much like Giselle, he doesn't understand why this place is different. And decides it can't be, so he just shrugs off the temporary setbacks he experiences.

In New York, Edward is even more of a nincompoop and has to stumble upon his love in order to find her. Pip, Giselle's sidekick, a talking chipmunk follows Edward to New York to help him find the princess. In the real world, he can no longer talk and becomes amazed that he has to lead the Prince by the hand to find his one true love.

But the Queen also sends her henchman, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) to New York. He must do everything he can to stop them from reuniting. When Nathaniel realizes Chip might actually tell Edward where Giselle is, he also tries to subdue the chipmunk.

""Enchanted"" starts to unravel towards the end of the film.  Susan Sarandon plays Queen Narissa, and during the animated sequences, she is quite good, playing a variation on ""Snow White""'s wicked queen, complete with poison apples. But her big moment, during the finale is a bit lackluster. This is no fault of Sarandon's, who is a great actress, but rather the writer and director. When you would expect her to start pulling every magic trick out of her hat, she is rather simply subdued. But then again, this is only the prelude for the real finale. This is, in and of itself a problem. Because the finale starts of slow and then ramps up to another big moment, it just seems to go on forever.

""Enchanted"" is a lot of fun, and has a lot going for it. It is the perfect film for family holiday viewing. Will it become a classic? No. But it will help provide some fun entertainment during an otherwise stressful time of year.",1197504000,,7978,4.696709585121602
80204,5,078887148X,"I absolutely adored this movie, and I can't believe the Walt Disney company actually made it! ""Enchanted"" is a hilarious film in which a classic Disney fairytale collides with modern-day New York City. Prince Edward meets his true love, Giselle, in the fairytale world of Andalasia. Unfortunately, the prince's wicked stepmother doesn't want him to get married because she will forced up to give up her position as queen. Evil Queen Narissa pushes Giselle down a magical wishing well, and the poor princess-to-be ends up in a New York City sewer (where she also ceases to be animated).

Needless to say, Giselle (Amy Adams) and her fairytale mentality don't mesh well with the big city lifestyle. Fortunately, she runs into Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a kindhearted lawyer whose young daughter convinces him to lend Giselle a helping hand. Robert's kindness ends up causing a major rift between him and his girlfriend (Idina Menzel), and when Price Edward (James Marsden) finally arrives in the Big Apple to rescue his true love, Giselle realizes that her ""happily ever after"" story isn't all it's cracked up to be, and her heart may actually belong to someone else.

This is a fantastic film that celebrates (and slightly satirizes) many classic Disney animated films, especially ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty."" It's such a clever film, and the concept of fairytale characters walking around New York City in the year 2007 is every bit as funny to watch on-screen as you can possibly imagine. I really enjoyed the twist with Giselle's happily ever after ending, which I didn't see coming at first but suited the film perfectly. ""Enchanted"" also benefits from an outstanding cast. Dempsey and Marsden are excellent, and Susan Sarandon delivers an entertaining performance in the role of Queen Narissa (although I wish she'd been given a bit more screen time). However, this movie belongs to Amy Adams, who is absolutely brilliant and deserves an Academy Award nomination for her performance. She is amazing!

Overall, ""Enchanted"" is a very enchanting movie that deserves a place of honor in the Disney vault! Children and adults will adore this film.",1197417600,13,2152,5.090651558073654
80205,4,078887148X,"This movie proves that Disney doesn't take itself too seriously, at least not all the time.

I'm sure you've seen a bunch of those movies, all vaguely the same, with some beautiful princess and some dashing prince. They seek each other out for True Love, overcoming great hardships through derring-do and gratuitous bursts of song. What the True Lovers lack in the way of everyday pragmatics, they more than make up for impractical clothing.

Now dump that ethereal belief in frilly gowns and eternal romance into the rain-soaked lap of a New York divorce lawyer. The hope of eternal passion should simply die under the legal eye of a man whose job is to end marriages, and its corpse get trampled into the city's grunge. Instead, we see a spectacular satire on the Disney themes. Even the princess's magical command of the woodland animals translates neatly into the world of urban pests, complete with a song routine that I could scarcely hear over my own laughing.

Young kids might enjoy this. It features plenty of broad comedy, and most of the dangers seem mild and story-bookish enough that they're not truly threatening. There's something here for the slightly more sophisticated tweenager, too. Most inmportantly, its offers enough cleverness to reward the adult who pays for the kids to see it.

80206,4,078887148X,"This is a delightfully silly and fun movie.  Be sure to start watching it with an open, childish readiness.  It requires its viewer to give in to the almost saccharine mood...but it rewards the willingness to go along for the ride.

ENCHANTED starts in animated form, and it begins the story of a young girl who is a mix of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty (when they were both awake)...a typical Disney princess, in fact, even down to living in a large tree and being helped in all her daily tasks by the many creatures in the woods.  She pines for a handsome prince, and amazingly, one is just about to discover her...through her singing, of course.  The jealous queen flies into a rage, and her machinations basically cause a tunnel to open, one that pushes the princess through to OUR modern New York City...right in the heart of Times Square, in fact.  The movie turns glowingly ""real life"" at that point, and we now get to enjoy the ""fish out of water"" story of an enchanted princess, and see how she gets on in our world.

Now the princess looks a lot like the spunky and endearing Amy Adams (JUNEBUG)!  She is confused and somewhat dazzled by all she sees, but also clearly expects someone to simply come to her rescue at any moment.  That rescue comes very reluctantly in the form of attorney Patrick Dempsey, who along with his cute little daughter, takes Adams home to get her in from the cold.  Will she end up staying longer than one night?  Will the tightly wound Dempsey loosen up with the this lovely and beguiling girl's help?  What do you think?

Into our world soon comes the prince (James Marsden) and he's so much fun.  He's totally clueless, completely in love with himself and the IDEA of being in love with Adams and he's brave, clumsy, dashing, silly, conceited and good-hearted all in one.  He's not the villian of the piece, he's the comic relief.  His assistant has come along (Timothy Spall) and that slimy individual is really working for the wicked queen...with the idea of perhaps killing the princess.  Certainly can't have the two falling in love.

And that's most of the film.  It's the details that make it so much fun.  There are simply wonderful scenes, such as when Adams enlists the help of the local fauna to clean up the apartment (who would have thought rats and roaches made such good custodians!?).  There's a perfectly Disney kind of song to go with the scene...but seeing it in ""real"" life just adds a element of delight...you'll find yourself smiling throughout.  Another very ambitious production number takes place in Central Park, and it hearkens back to the grand old days of movie musicals such as SOUND OF MUSIC or MARY POPPINS...when the WHOLE TOWN seemed to take part in the number and a classic crane shot is all that will work to take in the entire sweeping panorama.

Smaller touches such as how Adams gets her first few dresses, or seeing Marsden discovering television are fun.  Frankly, the whole movie, even when you see every plot twist coming, is a treat.  It is quite sincere...it never makes the kinds of inside jokes that make the Shrek movies, for example.  It is never too cloying, but it isn't afraid to be grandly romantic.

None of that would work if it weren't for the stellar Adams.  She is a comedic, musical and romantic dynamo...and I think this film makes her a star.  She's nicely paired with Dempsey, who we can enjoy watching thaw.  Marsden is also sincere and funny.  His character has a good heart, and when he finds HIS true love...that's a great little moment too.

To me, the primary weakness is the villians.  Spall is just generically nasty...almost like a rat come life...but he's such a bufoon that we never truly fear him or really give him much thought at all.  Susan Sarandon plays the witch who must finally come to earth herself to take care of business...and everything about the portrayal is generic.  Her costumes, her lines, her special effects.  It's as though the movie wanted to combine all Disney wicked witches into one, and they ended up with an unscary generic witch.  The movie never really gives you a sense of any peril.

But that doesn't detract too much from the fun and frivolity of this well-named film.  Only the hardest hearts will not be enchanted.",1196812800,2,4263,4.633333333333334
80207,5,078887148X,"I'll be blunt, I'm a stereotypical, young, male college student that enjoys films like Red Dawn, Rambo, The Rock and Aladdin.  In other words, you would NEVER expect me to go to the movie theatre, fork over X amount of money to go see Disney's Enchanted.  It was Thanksgiving and I was at my Mom's place away from college and she wanted to see Enchanted while my brother and I wanted to go see Hitman.  Needless to say, I lost the coin toss.

I went to the theatre and realized my friend John and I were the only males in there that wasn't a grandpa taking his grandchildren or a dad taking his daughters.  I got lots of looks from the audience and felt quite embarrassed.  HOWEVER, throughout the movie I think John and I laughed the hardest and not because we hated it but because we genuinely enjoyed it.  I left the theatre feeling like my money was well spent and later went back to see it again.

One of the emerging trends in Disney films is the inclusion of adult popular culture references in order to keep them from falling asleep or wishing seppuku since they are the ones forking over the money.  Enchanted had numerous references to past Disney films from Snow White, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and even Cinderella.  It was enough to keep my interest perked and my laughter on key.

The story is pretty simple, a cartoonish damsel in distress is banished to New York by the evil step-mother and the hilarity of culture clash commences (could be worse, she could've been sent to Canada eh?).  The damsel randomly breaks out in song much to the bewilderment of others, finds animals to clean house and makes dresses out of the most... off-the-wall things.

It's a good mixture of Disney magical adventures, adults humor (but not too vulgar), popular culture adventure and elements that actually make it a family film.  I was happy to spend money to see it again and I recommend this to all Disney fans, families and any popular culture fans.  A 92% overall.",1196812800,7,1971,4.543909348441926
80208,5,078887148X,"In the animated world of Andalasia, Giselle (Adams) dreams of falling in love with a prince.  Fortunately, Prince Edward (Marsden) falls in love with her the moment he sees her.  Of course, Edward's evil step-mother, Queen Narissa (Sarandon) is not happy with the match, and banishes her to New York City - the real world.  With the help of Nathaniel (Spall) and a talking chipmunk, Edward goes on a quest to return Giselle to their world.  In the real world, Giselle is a fish-out-of-water who is rescued from wandering the streets by Robert (Dempsey), a single parent who doesn't believe her story but is too nice to just leave her.  If Edward is able to find her, she may have to decide who really is her true prince.

""Enchanted"" is a great movie, capturing the spirit of Disney's princess movies.  Amy Adams is adorable as Giselle.  She clearly has done her homework, and has the mannerisms down pat.  She looks and acts like she just stepped out of a Disney cartoon.  She is the reason that this movie is as good as it is.  The rest of the cast fill their roles nicely.  Marsden is good as the dopey prince, and Sarandon gets to have some fun as the evil Queen.  ""Enchanted"" is an enjoyable film, and I highly recommend it.",1196812800,4,1229,4.506787330316742

What I did not expect is that my wife and I would love it too. We laughed and were entertained through the whole movie. At the beginning, I wondered what was up. The opening animation sequence is primitive and cheesy, looking like something from the 1950's. I soon figured out that this was Disney spoofing themselves. When the film switches to live action, it really takes off. At the heart of the picture is Amy Adams as the princess. She is luminous, beautiful, and very funny. I look forward to seeing her in future films. Brilliant casting all the way around, and a definite winner for Disney.",1196726400,2,673,4.479674796747967
80210,4,078887148X,"When I first heard about Enchanted, I immediately wrote it off.  While I've enjoyed older Disney affair, a lot of their recent movies not featuring pirates have left me empty and wishing for the movies that had their signature sparkle.  Then, the reviews started pouring in and they were mostly positive.  So, I allowed myself to be dragged to the flick, hoping for the best.  And I'm glad I did.

Enchanted opens with an inspired zoom into the top of the Disney Castle and to a pop-up book that begins the tale simply with narration provided by Julie Andrews.  Presented as a bright cartoon, we quickly get to know the stereotypical Disney Princess, here named Giselle; you know, the one who speaks with animals, lives in an enchanted forest, is completely naive to the way the world works and pines for her True Love (who she hasn't even met yet).  The introduction brings to mind all of the older Disney movies like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.

Things quickly go sour after Giselle meets her Prince Charming and his Evil Stepmother and she ends up being pushed into a well, turning up in downtown New York.  Here is where the movie begins to shine.  The rest of the film is a perfect dichotomy of real world and Disney world as Giselle, the perfectly innocent and naive princess, has to deal with a world that has grown cynical and laughs at such things as happy endings, true love and romance.

The casting is truly inspired.  James Marsden hammed it up in this summer's Hairspray and takes a similar comic approach to his Prince Charming stereotype to great laughs.  Patrick Dempsey mopes to perfection about being rational and not needing romance.  Idina Menzel who starred in the musical productions of Wicked and Rent (also the movie version of Rent), is a terrific choice for Nancy, the other love interest for Dempsey's Robert.  And, of course, Susan Sarandon as the wicked witch/Stepmother.

But, above them all, the weight of the film rests on Amy Adams as Giselle.  And it is her that turned even this cyncial-and-sick-of-Disney-sappiness-person into a fan.  Her mix of naivete and innocence perfectly captures the character that you cannot help but smile whenever she's onscreen.  She lights up the picture and carries it.

All in all, its a great family film and a great film for everyone.  By mixing up the standard cliche-ridden Disney stories with what it'd be like in the real world, Disney succeeded where so many of their recent hits failed.  They completely recaptured the magic and the feeling of their previous works and crafted a story that's perfect for the season.  I'd definitely recommend checking this one out.",1196640000,2,2644,4.800884955752212
80211,5,078887148X,"Let me make it immediately clear that I'm not a big fan of Disney films. Most (if not all) of them are overly-schmaltzy, teach kids nothing about the real world, and are so simple a chimp could follow them. But my twin 19-year-olds (boy and a girl) wanted to check out this latest mouseketeer event. It isn't hard to imagine someone of my nature grudgingly slapping down hard-earned cash then grumpily sitting with an overpriced and oversized box of popcorn, ready to be bored out of my mind and intellectually insulted.

What I got instead was a big shock. I'd obviously seen the ads for the film on television and thought, ""Ugh. Another no-brainer."" My initial concerns seemed justified as the film started and was quickly assaulted with the 2-dimensional animation we've all seen during early Disney tellings. I sank further into my chair, grumbling, ""This is super-lame."" But as the film progressed, and the animation gave way to live action characters, I began to realize that Disney was ...poking fun at itself? No. It couldn't be, could it? But yes, they did, and they did it right!

This is a melting pot of animation, live-action, and animation within live-action that is seldom seen. That's a nice score for Disney. Added to this is the retelling of old fables that've become part of our movie history. A combination of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and several other commonly seen films are incorporated into ENCHANTED to give it a familiar yet equally unique story.

Amy Adams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talladega-Nights-The-Ballad-of-Ricky-Bobby/dp/B000J4P9P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</a>) stars as Giselle, a soon-to-be princess recently swept off her feet (literally) by Prince Edward (James Marsden,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000HCO83Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>); it's noteworthy to mention this all takes place in the early animation portions of the film. But Prince Edward's mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabethtown/dp/B000CNESJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabethtown</a>) doesn't want to give up her queenly title and throws Giselle down a ""wishing well"" on her wedding day. Giselle anti-magically reemerges near Time's Square in New York (we've now entered the live action portion of the film). Searching high and low for her castle and her future groom, Giselle quickly learns that New York is no fantasy world. Jewelry is stolen off her person by the homeless, her dress quickly becomes soiled, rain drenches her, and no one is saying friendly things or breaking into happy song.

Divorce attorney Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-Writers/dp/B000NOK1KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom Writers</a>) and his eight-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) are on their way home via cab when they discover poor Giselle. She (again) literally falls into Robert's lap and he and his daughter feel pity for this seemingly deranged woman and take her home with them to help her find a way home (via cab, subway, etc.). Robert is less than thrilled about having an attractive woman in the house as he is prepared to pop the question to his longtime girlfriend Angie (Samantha Ivers,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>). But Giselle falls asleep on Robert's sofa and he's forced to let her stay the night. Come morning new discoveries await Robert and his daughter. Giselle, who can normally call up all the cute and fuzzy animals of the forest to help her with household chores, decides to do the same here. But her sing-song doesn't bring cuddly rabbits and dainty deer. She's in New York City, and when her enchanting voice reaches the creatures of this land, they come in the form of cockroaches, sewer rats, and pigeons. They still help her clean up Robert's apartment, but when Robert awakens, he finds the invasion of his home by insects and rodents too much and shushes them out of his plush home. He also finds that Giselle has made a new outfit for herself out of his expensive curtains. At wits end, Robert takes Giselle to work and thrusts her needs onto the company secretary who can't find out where her home is let alone who she is.

In the meantime, the now unanimated Prince Edward comes to the real New York City, too, and finds it terribly difficult to locate his lost love. With him comes an assistant of the queen, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000E6EK38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>), who's job it is to make sure he and Giselle never meet up. Failing that, he's supposed to give Giselle a poisoned apple (in the tradition of Snow White).

When all fails the queen, she's forced to come to the real world, too, and does so with frightening ferocity. But can even her powers stand against true love's first kiss (a theme that runs throughout the movie)?

It isn't necessarily the fairy tale items that grab movie-goers but the failing of those items by those that come from such a land where things exist and are forced into a land where reality is more brutal. The reverse obviously becomes true, too, as those who live a hardened life in the real world come to accept that having a bit of fantasy fun and believing in the unbelievable can have overwhelmingly positive results on your life, love, and your happily ever after.

The movie is funny beyond mention, too, with some perfectly executed scenes (including a dance sequence in Central Park, watching Prince Edward break into song only to be stopped by bicyclists plowing into him, Giselle's continued clothing designs by utilizing various items in Robert's home, Prince Edward believing a television to be a kind of magical looking glass, just to name a few).

The film is touching and, in the end, pretty predictable. But that didn't stop young and old from applauding when the film ended. I even found myself clapping a few times. Wow. Imagine that.",1196553600,8,6298,5.5863874345549736
80212,5,078887148X,"Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know

(Lyrics from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Some Day my Prince Will Come)

""Enchanted"" begins in an animated land named Andalasia, with a young girl named Giselle (Amy Adams) meeting the prince of her dreams, Prince Edward (James Marsden) and preparing to live happily ever after.  Andalasia, and large parts of the movie are based on a combination of the Disney worlds of Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, so of course you can count on the appearance of an evil stepmother-wicked witch (Susan Sarandon) to put an end to all the wretched happiness.

As soon as Giselle comes within striking distance of the castle on her wedding day, the witch (disguised as an old hag) zaps her into another world where ""happily ever afters"" and true love apparently haven't existed for years - present day Manhattan.

Switching to live action, Giselle tries to understand the New York state of mind, and falls into the arms of a McDreamy guy named Robert (I don't have to tell you who the actor is, now do I?)  While Giselle begins getting acclimatized and introduces herself to the local wildlife, a rescue party from Andalasia also uses the Manhattan transfer, and soon the streets of New York are stormed by a CGI chipmunk, a prince in search of his missing damsel, and a henchman with a funny accent (Timothy Spall).

If you're a fan of fairy tales, and in particular Disney tales, you'll love the little touches like poisoned apples in the Big Apple, Beauty & the Beast ballroom dancing and glass slippers, but this updated magical, musical, funny fairy tale will be a treat for the whole family.

A definite ""YES"" for family entertainment, and one you probably should buy when it comes out on DVD.  Rated: 4.5 stars

80213,4,078887148X,"What the world really needs in 2007 are more films with the ageless charm and wit of ENCHANTED. It's priceless entertainment from the Disney studios, providing plenty of chuckles and downright laughter as PATRICK DEMPSEY, AMY ADAMS, JAMES MARSDEN and SUSAN SARANDON go through the paces of their fairy-tale roles. What helps immeasurably is that the witty script has been given a sumptuous look in both the animated and real-life scenes and the musical score is fresh and appropriate, if not a bit familiar in that it seems to be borrowing heavily from other Disney films--most of the time intentionally so.

The script has the animated Giselle, a princess, being banished from the palace when her beauty surpasses that of Queen Narissa (SUSAN SARANDON). She exiles her to an existence in hell--make that New York City. Once in the city, after climbing out of a manhole cover in full princess regalia, the lovely princess (AMY ADAMS in a cheerfully over the top performance), runs into all sorts of predicaments because she acts like someone who ""just escaped from a Hallmark card"", according to the lawyer (PATRICK DEMPSEY) who gives her shelter for the night but soon finds himself forming a romantic attachment to her.

It moves along at a brisk pace, is stunning to watch because the hand drawn animation is so beautifully rendered, and is fun all the way, with everyone giving their own brand of exuberance to the acting.

SUSAN SARANDON is extremely effective as The Wicked Queen and her make-up as the old hag deserves an Oscar. JAMES MARSDEN has all the physical requirements for his role as Prince Edward and tops that with a performance modeled after the vain Gaston from ""Beauty and the Beast"".

There's no shortage of romantic chemistry between PATRICK DEMPSEY and AMY ADAMS in the leads, evident from their first awkward encounter to the final fadeout.

Too bad Hollywood isn't capable of churning out more films like this one, as solid a romantic fantasy as anyone could wish for with lots of sly fun at the expense of other Disney classics and enough old-fashioned charm to satisfy adults and children.",1196208000,,2117,4.902234636871508
80214,4,078887148X,"In `Enchanted' two worlds collide:  The real world and the animated world.  This has been done before.  We've seen Tom and Jerry tap dance along with Gene Kelly, and we certainly experienced this fusion in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit/dp/6305531412/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>'  and later with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Jam/dp/0790749858/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Jam</a>'.  This time the two worlds are separate, but they meet into one another.  As if pop-up books spring characters from children's fantasy stories and brought them live to the modern day world.  How would we react?  Just the way they do in the movie.  People in New York City would wince at Shakespearean actors on the loose and in their way during a busy work day.  Much like they did in the movie `Elf'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elf-Infinifilm-Edition/dp/B0002F6BRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elf (Infinifilm Edition)</a>&nbsp;with Will Ferrell and James Caan, only better.  And as it is with that recent Christmas classic, the meeting is meant to make the world we know a better place.  That's why the enchantment works so well.

If you want to bring wide-eyed innocence to the screen, I know of few better ways than to have Amy Adams (`Junebug') play Giselle, a Snow White or Cinderella figure who escapes the evil witch, Narissa (here wonderfully performed by Susan Sarandon in a role we're used to seeing Glen Close or Tilda Swinton play) from the magic kingdom, Andalasia.  She's betrothed to Prince Edward (bka ""Charming"" or James Marsden of `Hairspray` fame) and on the run through a starry expanse that reminded me very closely of a portal used in one of the later `Myst` games.  (""Destiny"" is his horse, which is to say there isn't too much subtlety here.)  And, as each character goes through the symbolically significant portal, a man-hole cover, one easily forgets that this trajectory is a close reading of the focal point of 'Being John Malkovich'.  Nevermind all this, however, for no matter how familiar certain elements may feel, the thrust of this film is certainly fresh and inviting.

The witch wants to dissolve their nuptials and has the portly Nathaniel to chase her down.  On the allies' side is a chipmunk messenger who has good intentions, but a poor success rate with only charades as his communication method. Running into Giselle is Robert (Patrick Dempsey) a jaded single father who is a prosperous, but floundering attorney.  She needs him to shelter her from the rude awakening of a rainstorm on a bad side of town, and he needs her to give him a new outlook in life. He's about to give his hand to Nancy, much to the chagrin of daughter, Morgan.

One of the great merits of this movie is how they suspend our disbelief to the events that occur.  Marsden, Adams, and Sarandon bring the otherworld with them in ways that preclude any notions that over acting prima donnas are spilling their way into Central Park and beyond.  Particularly Adams' wide-eyed innocence sets up that her displacement can bring real joy and revitalization from the past without seeming facile or saccharine.  (Or when it is shown to be wildly unreal, there's plenty of good humor to poke fun of it all when they break into song.)

Once Narissa catches up with them, we begin to see that there really is decency we can draw upon in our own world and a menace that exists in their world that is worse than our own.  Innoculated with chivalry and romance, all the dirt and grime of city life are given a face lift along with our spirits.  Just like 'Across the Universe'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B000UZ4G82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>&nbsp;before it, 'Enchanted' is an experience of love and music transcending the dingy mean-spiritedness that is all too often identified as reality.",1195948800,46,4056,5.5

She plays unironic naivete so perfectly throughout this movie that she utterly convinces you that her prince will come. It is her performance that takes this fractured fairytale and elevates it to far above average. While I doubt that a light-weight Disney family flick will draw the finicky eyes of the Academy, Adams is so perfect in her role that she makes Giselle an irresistible addition to the long list of Disney characters. Add a solid supporting cast, and you get one of Disney's best family features in recent memory.

Suddenly Giselle pops up in Times Square and soon finds herself confronted with hustlers, bustlers and inattentive people. You know, typical New Yorkers.

Enter Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) as Lawyer McDreamy and his sad but wise daughter, who find themselves coming to Gisselle's rescue, and things get fun. At this point, every Disney fairytale cliches gets poked and prodded to a wonderful effect, and there are easy laughs throughout. (Especailly Phillip's daughter's ""better than a fairy godmother"" line.) Where in the enchanted forest, every cute and big-eyed critter rushes to help Giselle, in NYC, you have to settle for the real multi-legged creatures...and it is one hilarious scene. Same for the obligatory ""everyone breaks into song"" moment, where Adams tries to serenade Dempsy in Central Park. Dempsey tries to convince Adams that people just don't break into song-and-dance in the real world...and of course has to follow haplessly as everyone promptly does so.

Naturally Prince Edward wants his Princess back, so James Marsden shoots through the Times Square Manhole and sword-fights a bus. Playing his toothy-grinned good looks for all they're worth, Marsden lets the goofy contrasts between the two worlds play in good fun, while the weasely henchmen to the Evil Queen (English-do-badder Timothy Spall) tries to thwart their locating Giselle. Every Disney classic from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs/dp/B00003CXCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>&nbsp;(poisoned apples) to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella</a>&nbsp;gets tweaked along the way, in a parody that is thick on charm and light on its feet.

By the time Giselle and The Evil Queen square off and the roles of hero and saved get spun, you'll forgive the fact that the third act starts getting a bit too far out. The songs, by Alan Menken and Stephen Scwhartz, are all in the vein of Disney songs since they began their hot streak in the 90's. Julie Andrews adds a touchstone with her book-end narration, and the hand drawn (none of the digital silliness here!) completes the classic look. With Amy Adams' star turn as Giselle, Disney's ""Enchanted"" is a solid family movie that everyone can get the humor of.",1195948800,4,3420,5.86144578313253
