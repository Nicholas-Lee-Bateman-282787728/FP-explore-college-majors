5182331,4,B008U1AN6M,"Honestly, this is one of the funniest stand-ups I've ever seen years! Tony Roberts, Gary Owen and Lil Duval had me CRYING! Tony Roberts had one of his best performances in this one. He's incredibly funny and I look forward to more of these!",1349827200,3,240,4.4772727272727275
5182332,5,B008U1AN6M,I had the opportunity to catch this taping in Orlando and it was hilarious! I was literally laughing out loud at all of the comedians. Lil Duval and Capone were especially funny. This comedy series gives all of the rest a run for their money.,1349222400,3,242,4.4

5182397,5,B008U1AN6M,"Different strokes for different folks. I've seen all Shaq's comedy jams, and this was the best one over all. All of the comedians had their moments but Lil Duval and Capone were the funniest. Gary Owen is funny as hell and was a good host. Anybody who didn't think this was funny probably loved All Star Comedy jam from Atlanta (which was horrible), Friends, Seinfield, and Saturday Night Live (after Eddie Murphy). This one had me crying before it was all over.",1426032000,,462,4.646341463414634

5182412,3,B008U1AN6M,It was just okay. Gary Owens was funny but the comedians seem to have no script. They were all over the place when it came to a subject matter.,1391990400,,143,3.9655172413793105
5182413,4,B008U1AN6M,This video had me cracking up! ROTFL (Rolling on the floor laughing) The host was very funny! Can't wait until the next Comedy Jam.,1390780800,,131,4.5
5182414,3,B008U1AN6M,"I choose this rating because this comedy was not all that good until the end of the show, so I wouldn't recommend this comedy. Every  person have his or her on opinion.",1389052800,,168,4.25

5182418,3,B008U1AN6M,"This was just okay compared to the rest of the All Star Comedy Jam's, Gary Owens was a great host, but some of the rest of the comedians was not that funny, its just ok, I hope the next Shaquille O'Neal All Star Comedy Jam will be better, but this I had to give just 3 stars, but its good to get for your collection, another thing it didn't have any female comedians which would have added a little more flavor to this, but buy it if you are a All Star jam Fan.

5182421,1,B008U1AN6M,The worst comedy of their career.  I have seen them do so much better.  It was as if they were given a script on what to do jokes on and you could really tell that they were not all that into it.,1374624000,,195,3.619047619047619
5182432,3,B008U1AN6M,"Capone and the guy from Florida are the best, the rest were weak. Gary need a full role, he is a funny comedian, hosting is not for him.",1365897600,3,136,3.892857142857143

8530405,5,B008U1AN6M,"I saw Capone live and he is funny as hell. When you leave a comedy show that he's preforming in, your stomach will be hurting you. The man is born to be a comedian. They are all good, but Capone is the best.",1515369600,,207,3.8372093023255816
