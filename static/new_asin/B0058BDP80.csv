4598206,5,B0058BDP80,"Maybe a complete Columbo Blu-ray set will be produced for the US market some time in the future. Maybe not. But if you're a Columbo fan who wants to watch this classic series in all it's high def goodness, this set will not disappoint.
Premium priced, yes, but no buyer's remorse here.",1418428800,2,285,4.5
4598207,5,B0058BDP80,"A quality product in every sense - from the packaging to the technical aspects of the discs themselves. If you cannot read Japanese, you will miss out on some of the extras like the descriptive booklets and notes, but this in no  way impacts on the programs, which are readily watchable in the original English with or without subtitles, in superb color and sound. The on-screen menus are in Japanese, but it is extremely simple to navigate for watching.  A must-have for true Columbo fans.",1404086400,2,490,4.752941176470588
4598208,5,B0058BDP80,"This is a great box set, and it's criminal that a box set of Columbo like this on Blu-ray has never been released in North America and Europe. It contains every single episode, including the pilot episode Prescription Murder from 1968.

The packaging is of very high standard. There is a long booklet telling you about every single episode, although it's all in Japanese. There is also a booklet called Prescription Murder, which, I guess is all about that episode. Again, this is also in Japanese. Although it's all in Japanese, it makes you wonder why this Blu-ray box set can't be released in North America and Europe with all the words translated in to English. It's not like they've got to scan the negatives again. This Japanese box set was released by Universal (who own the rights to all episodes of the show in Europe and North America), so I find it even more annoying that this Blu-ray box set isn't available on the continents mentioned above. The DVD Complete Series (which is available in Europe and North America) just has one very short book about the series which has around five pages.

It should also be noted that although this is a Japanese box set, the title on the box is all in English. It's also worth noting that the titles of each episode are written in Japanese and English. This includes in both booklets, on the back of each Blu-ray case (six in all), on the discs themselves and on the on-screen menu, so you'll have no trouble at all finding a particular episode you want to watch.

The picture quality on the standard DVD Complete Series is actually very good, and I've often wondered if the standard DVD Complete Series release is sourced from these HD transfers used for this Blu-ray release.

Although the picture on the standard DVD Complete Series is good, this Blu-ray version looks far more stunning in HD. I would guess that the first generation negatives were scanned in 1080p or 1080i for this Blu-ray release, although I can't be 100% sure. I don't think using second or third generation film copies would produce such a fresh picture. The picture is in 4:3 on the earlier episodes with a black bar down each side (which personally doesn't bother me). The later episodes were filmed in a dual format and were captured in both 4:3 and 16:9 (I guess to make them future proof). The 16:9 versions are used on this Blu-ray box set, and they fill the whole screen. These are the episodes from 1989 onwards.

The standard DVD Complete Series is 100% 4:3. I personally prefer to have the 16:9 versions. If this dual format was to make them future proof, then surly the DVD releases now should provide the 16:9 versions.

As for the audio, all the Blu-ray discs in this box set have a dubbed Japanese sound track, as well as the original English sound track. For the later episodes that were made in stereo, only the English sound track is in stereo. The dubbed Japanese sound track is in mono for these episodes. Obviously, I don't really care about this, but if it was the other way around I would be quite pi*sed off! The sound quality in English is top-notch as well. You don't have to watch it with Japanese, English or any other subtitles either.

There are 35 discs all together and the picture format is MPEG-4 AVC, as opposed to the more common MPEG-2 format. MPEG-4 AVC is supposed to be a better format, but I can never tell the difference.

I got a brand new copy on Amazon.jp for GBP171.28, which is US$280.02. It used to be a lot more around a year ago.

I hope this review has helped Columbo fans decide on whether they want to buy this Blu-ray box set or not.",1387929600,9,3611,4.534562211981567
4598209,5,B0058BDP80,"I never leave reviews, however this news must be shared. If you are a real Columbo fan (you know who you are) you must see this set. The Japanese artists who rejuvinated these, some of which are 40 years old  performed a miracle for Columbo lovers. The old episodes are amazingly clear, you will see detail, and hear sounds that were impossible to imagine on the VHS or DVD versions. The packaging is lovely, and the shipping took about 11 days including weekends. I purchased from samurai-media-JPN4US,and was very pleased. The Amazon Japanese website would not for some reason ship to me, however their price was somewhat cheaper. This was not inexpensive, however to me is worth much more than the money paid. I hope that the people who are still around who actually were involved in making these films are enjoying them in this format. The Japanese menus etc are easily figured out in a few minutes, and subtitles can be turned off. You may get a kick out of seeing your favorite Columbo with Japanese dubbing turned on. Absolutely DELUXE- stunning!",1374192000,12,1053,4.754098360655738
4598210,5,B0058BDP80,"My box set has just arrived today,and I got it directly from amazon japan very quickly at a good price(compare to other options) about 300 euro including tax and duty.
I have to say that the images look definitely much  better than the SD versions whith pristine  brilliant natural colors and good definition, although not always  on a continuous level.
In conclusion it worths the economic sacrifice if you really like columbo!",1363996800,2,428,4.916666666666667
4598211,5,B0058BDP80,"Columbo appeared on dvd properly in Japan many years before he did in the UK or US so it's possible that the Bluray situation may be the same so dive in and purchase it. Japanese subtitles do appear when playing but they are easy to switch off using the SUBTITLE button on your remote or via the disc menu - once you get to know your way around it . Pictures are superb although the pre-credits teasers on some episodes are less than perfect . All the revival episodes are in 16:9 , that's the 22 starting from 1989.  The only bonus features I can find are the presence of music and effects tracks on some episodes. Murder Smoke & Shadows seems to be the only revival episode with one but there are quite a few of the 70's episodes with the tracks including the tv movie , series pilot , final episode and some others. Nice option to select only the scenes with music so you can view for anywhere between 13 and 37 minutes depending on the film rather than having to browse through the complete film to skip the silence. I suppose its a bit expensive compared to some of the bargains we get these days but for die hard fans of Columbo this set with all 69 films on is a must - worked out just under 300 for me including a customs charge of 51 - it was 243 delivered from Amazon Japan and it took 3 days to arrive in the UK . If you're a big fan and have some spare cash I can't recommened it highly enough . Its region free and even has English subtitles",1363305600,14,1454,4.119718309859155
4598212,5,B0058BDP80,"I was hoping that Universal would put out a complete Columbo set on blu-ray, but no cigar. So I purchased this Columbo Complete Blu-ray box from Japan. While it was a splurge, I am completely satisfied with the set. The video looks crisp and the sound is consistant throughout. In case you are wondering, the programs are in English with Japanese subtitles. There may be a way to turn off the subtitles, but I have yet to find it. I have not found the subtitles to be distracting. The set is well packaged, simulating a cigar box, and has notes and a script from a show, but unfortunately the text, with the exception of individual show titles, is entirely in Japanese. One of the discs has the NBC Mystery Movie Theme openning as a bonus feature. That sure beought back pleasant memories of when I first saw these shows back in the seventies. I would think that one day a similar product will be available in the US, but if are like me and don't want to wait for it, then I can recomend that you buy this collection, cigar box and all. I bought this from Amazon in Japan and was pleased with the price (compared to others) and the promptness of delivery.",1358294400,10,1155,4.401869158878505
8461319,5,B0058BDP80,"Happy with this as a purchase. I think the following have been covered elsewhere but, for reference:

1. Seems to be region free and I (Australia) had no issues with playback.
2. It is subtitled by default when playing but this can be turned off and or English as a subtitle is available.
3. There some published content in the box that is only in Japanese. That's unfortunate but with various transcription services - even from photos - those desperate to read the content should be OK.

Strangely, in playing some of the 'season 2' discs, I did note that the episodes seemed to be out of whack with what was listed on IMDB; some of the episodes seemed to be listed as season 3 on that site. So, if you want to watch everything in the sequence as broadcast you might need to do some research and re-order the discs from the numerical sequence provided.

Other than that it was a purchase I'd been tossing up for a while - I already owned a box set of DVDs - but the better quality was compensation and I'm glad to have this available to  re-watch in the future.",1526774400,,1062,4.348484848484849
8461320,5,B0058BDP80,excellent quality!  worth every penny.  It is fairly easy to turn off the subtitle even though I don't know any Japanese :),1512432000,,123,4.545454545454546
8461321,5,B0058BDP80,"I love it. The box is sturdy paperboard with lovely wrapping, the booklets are probably nice but my Japanese is now useless. It's good enough to figure out which disc has a desired episode. There's a handy strap to help lift the cases out of the box. The bluray cases are nice and easy. The blurays themselves have a beautiful simple menu system that, while in Japanese, is easy to drive. The picture quality of the episodes is amazing -- better even than the content that was on Netflix in 2016. (It feels like the same scans but higher bandwidth than Netflix uses in their streams.)

It's eerie to be watching a version that is significantly nicer than was ever broadcast on TV in the hey-day.

Of the 38 episodes I've watched so far only a handful had the 'music only' sound tracks. I was hoping they all would have this option.

Oh, one more thing: There's also an unskippable 41 second pre-roll video that's shown before the menu. It's a surprising blemish on otherwise top-notch product, but hardly unique to just this set. (I have a theory that half of video piracy is fueled by people upset at unskippable content on blurays.) If you intend to watch the second episode on a disc later, I suggest playing the second episode for a second, pausing, and then turning off your player -- many will jump right to the paused point the next time they're turned on.",1499990400,3,1363,4.532520325203252

8461323,5,B0058BDP80,"To echo a previous review, any self-respectiing Columbo fan MUST get this.  Yes, it is pricey but worth every cent.  Period. The detail and clarity is remarkable; so much so, that it enhances and elevates the ""Columbo experience"" to a whole new level.  Love it, love it, love it.

8461326,5,B0058BDP80,"There is no getting around the price tag. It's expensive. I would love for an official US release, but life is short and I finally ordered after debating it for a long time. You won't find better image quality. The disks do play in US Bluray players. You can turn off the Japanese subtitles easily and the menu set up is easy to figure out and I can't read any Japanese whatsoever. One more thing... I don't regret this purchase at all.",1485734400,5,436,4.329268292682927
8461327,5,B0058BDP80,"Just had this BLU RAY box set imported from Japan, item was priced very good but the only thing that was not good was the tax this UK government charged me on this item  67.00. Any way this is the best i have ever seen columbo look with a very clear and sharp and colour full looking picture, from season,s one to seven the  you get a 4.3 picture frame that,s where you get on a wide screen television black line,s down each side of the screen but that,s the way it was made and shot back in the day, as you may know TV channels have started to screen more and more columbo episodes this way, as for season eight_nine and ten where made in 1.78.1 wide screen but never shown on TV in the UK that way, but this BLU RAY has given us it in that wide screen formate and again look,s fantastic as you can now see more on the left and right side of the screen to what' was missing on TV showings and the DVD,s as they are shown in full frame format, as for sound once again great_ very clear sounding, i just hope that this gets a UK BLU RAY release for all to enjoy this new lease on life for this great tv show,  as for columbo him self well as you all know he,s on TV all the time a lately for a new generation to start to appreciate this great show and the best ever detective of all time, long live columbo and GOD bless and rest the soul of the late great peter falk, or there is just one more thing_A GENIOUS MAN.",1479945600,3,1414,3.9543859649122806
8461328,5,B0058BDP80,"Fantastic!  The set is not cheap and I took the time to read other peoples feedback closely.  I was impressed with the overviews and it was clear this was a high quality product.  I am 100% thrilled with this set.  Much of the packaging is in Japanese as noted by other buyers but I think that is actually kind of a cool thing.  It gives it a unique mystique and makes a nice conversation piece (if you know anyone that cares about Columbo (hahaha).  The playback itself is 100% in English and the Japanese subtitles can be removed with subtitle button on your remote.  The folks that re-mastered this Blu Ray product did a GREAT job.  The color is excellent for the most part and some scenes are so clear and correct you would think it was a good quality modern DVD.  Funny thing I have noticed:  You can really tell when different cameras and film stock was used in different scenes.  Not to worry though, the worst shot on any disk in this set is better than the best show on the old US spec DVDs.  Some episodes and scenes have true dynamic depth and surprisingly rich color (reds in particular look fantastic for the most part).  My hat is off to the Japanese on this one.  It was expensive but worth every penny to me (A die hard Columbo fan).  I look at it as the last Columbo set I ever have to buy!",1456012800,10,1307,4.2560975609756095
