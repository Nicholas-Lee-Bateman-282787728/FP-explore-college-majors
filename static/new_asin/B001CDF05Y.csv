8286983,3,B001CDF05Y,"Excellent concert. Clapton, Page, and Beck on stage together! Doesn't get any better. Unfortunately,  the video quality is very poor. Concert from the 1980's, so, not unexpected.",1391990400,3,178,5.592592592592593

8286985,3,B001CDF05Y,"I bought this DVD about a year ago, this is a very poor South American version. They turned the full-frame screen into a widescreen format. The picture looks elongated or stretched. There are other versions out there (also South American) but I don't recommend this one, I resold it after I received in excited anticipation but was really disappointed in both the audio & video quality.",1293840000,9,386,4.863636363636363
