8210458,5,B000TRIR22,"The DVD contains very good information and I would recommend it to anyone who is starting out in soap making and is interested in the basics of melt and pour. Great information, examples, troubleshooting advice, along with the expected how-to's. But, if you are really interested in seeing more (and more up to date) information about soap making of all kinds (melt and pour, cold process, bath bombs, and specialty techniques) I would save my money and not buy the DVD. Anne-Marie has numerous wonderful and fun videos all under 10 minutes long on her Soap Queen TV blog and You Tube videos.",1391212800,2,592,4.757281553398058

8210460,5,B000TRIR22,"Making soap is terribly addictive fun and learning how to make soap from Anne-Marie just makes it that much better!

It had been years since I'd made melt and pour soap, so I ordered the DVD to see what new ideas I could find from Anne-Marie; I found all kinds of great info, starting with how to melt the base.  The soap I'm making now is much better, thanks to this DVD.

It's intended for beginners or folks wanting to brush up on how it's done.  You can visit Anne-Marie's website for further ideas on more advanced techniques in this type of soap making as well as making other toiletries.

A nice entry into soap making and kid friendly!",1215993600,7,643,4.369747899159663
