7020622,5,B00TQGGJTK,"If I were a Hollywood producer and Mr. Amazon, a screen writer, had come to me with the story and wanted me to make a movie out of it, I would have said to him, ""And after I buy this, what other ""bridges"" will you try to sell me"".  But, of course, I would have been wrong.  You see, no one has to ""suspend his disbelief"" here.  If you are doubtful of the story's veracity, think it is all made up, the subject of an imagination that focuses on the impossible, boy would you be wrong.  See, all these feelings and opinions would be valid except that they are all verified at the end of the movie when the people all these things actually happened to are showcased and shown in motion and still pictures.  They are real.  The things depicted in the move really did happen to them.  And the real people acted with the doubts, insecurity and, finally, the triumph of faith portrayed by the actors.  You see, there is a deeper lesson here.  A lesson that should cause us to lessen the doubts we may have when we hear of similar stories whether or not portrayed on film.  If it really happened to Hoovey, why couldn't it happen to a little girl with a serious abdominal problem (""Miracles from Heaven"") , or a family ravaged by the plague of addiction who find relief and comfort in places they never expected (quietly happening every day in ways we will never know).  ""Hoovey"" sends a powerful message of faith, fortitude and confidence in a power greater than us.  If it could happen to Hoovey (and it did), it could happen anywhere to anybody.",1472947200,2,1540,4.383802816901408

My husband and I both would recommend this movie and are glad we purchased it so we can watch it again.  Always make sure the people in your life realize how valuable they are to you because life is short and precious and we all have an expiration date but we don't always know when that is. I just read about parents watching their son playing High School football saw him tackled, taken off the field and after 9 days of a medically induced coma was gone.

7020705,4,B00TQGGJTK,"This film is based on the life of Eric ""Hoovy"" Elliot (Cody Linley) and family. Hoovy loved to play basketball and was hoping to play at the college level when he became ill. After an MRI, ""It's a tumor."" (Feel free to use your Arnold voice) Hoovey's days were over and the farm was in financial trouble. Hoovey manages to overcome which they credit to faith and at no time the skilled neurosurgeon who operated on him.

The film is meant to be inspirational, and repeats the lesson of Job a few times. A transfer student from Atlanta (Brandon Mychal Smith) provides some minor internal conflict. The acting is passable. While the film was designed to be emotional and heart felt, it wasn't over powering.",1434240000,2,705,4.64

8702865,5,B00TQGGJTK,"I am definitely not a basketball fan, and was not sure if I would like this movie. I loved it. The fact that is a true story, that it happened in real life, and the way this family handled the heavy crosses put in front of them, was what made the movie great. Acting is so good that one almost forgets one is watching actors, not the real people whose lives are displayed on the screen. Especially impressive were the young actors, all of them, from Hoovey's sister, to his girlfriend, to guys on his team. Very good. And there is no ""preaching""- it's just honest people living their honest lives, and because their faith is part of their lives, the faith is present in the movie. And it makes sense.",1529625600,,700,4.351145038167939
