3946598,5,B002LFPB2E,My husband bought this DVD/CD and we love it.  Although I have to admit I am a bit of a Christmas nerd and I enjoy the music more than he does.  The different scenes and the music truly sets the tone for Christmas!  Great to use for holiday entertaining or just relaxing around the house.  Living in Florida we don't have a chimney so it's nice to see the yule log on my screen while enjoying the peaceful and beautiful Christmas melodies in saxophone.,1322352000,2,452,4.345238095238095

8372897,4,B002LFPB2E,I haven't found how to get to all three scenes on the dvd.  The instructions say to hit the angle button on the remote. That button is not on my remote.  The fire looks great and I like the songs.  Cheap way to add a fireplace to the bedroom.,1484092800,,242,3.8979591836734695
