8757329,4,B01DYUYY7M,"P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong defended the championship against Drew Galloway with both men being aggressive with delivering chops throughout the crowd & one man being tossed into the ceiling & back wall while later as Strong lived up to his name of ""the Messiah of the Backbreaker"" heavily working over that area of the body with his variations of that maneuver while Drew showcased his strength being able to throw Strong around from different areas & positions along with stealing a page out of Strong's own playbook.  Former Tag Team Champion Evil Uno returned to P.W.G. to face off against Mike Bailey that saw a completely different side of Uno not previously seen living up to his name ""Evil"" with the tactics used on the floor to in the ring while Bailey used his trademark educated feet & speed offense with both men not afraid to leave to their feet on more than one occasion.  Other matches include Dalton Castle making his debut against Chuck Taylor in a match that definitely had it's entertaining moments knowing both men's personalities; Chris Hero vs. Trent? in a competitive match; Sami Callihan against Jack Evans that had antics from a kiss battle (and I don't mean the metal band) & beer drinking & chairs to the point where the commentary felt like they were in ""a Jackie Chan movie""; Andrew Everett's first singles match since his surgery in a back & forth encounter against Adam Cole; and Trevor Lee vs. Zack Sabre Jr. in a physical match with both men using a mat based style using submissions & chain wrestling working over different joints of the body.

Typical what you would expect from P.W.G. in this was a good card from top to bottom & a solid show overall.",1473897600,,1690,4.702702702702703
