8746673,5,B01A7ZKQ6K,"Documentary filmmaker Robert Mugge has made a few other films about Louisiana music and this is the latest. The film was an offshoot of a music project that was the idea of Station Manager Roger Lamay and Station Music Director Bruce Warren from the non-commercial FM radio station WXPN in Philadelphia  the home of the nationally syndicated World Caf with David Dye. Garnering funding from the Pew Center for Arts & heritage, XPN created a 16-month-long project to gather, present and preserve the musical culture and heritage of Southwest Louisiana (basically the area around Lafayette).

The project started by bringing some LA musicians to Philadelphia (actually, it was Camden, NJ across the river from Philly, where XPN holds their annual three-day music festival every July) to perform. (They also had an evening of dance in suburban Philly). Then Dye and Mugge travelled to Lafayette to record full, club performances by some of the living legends of Zydeco. Many are second (or even third) generation in the Ardoin family or the Dopsie family. The performances are great  nealy all complete. And the camera work makes you feel you are right there. Dye ties it all together with interviews between the performances.

The film runs 87 minutes but theres a BIG bonus here too: A 55-minute film showing a full set from Rosie Ledet.  A lot of entertainment  and education here  in a nicely done package at a darn good price.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
