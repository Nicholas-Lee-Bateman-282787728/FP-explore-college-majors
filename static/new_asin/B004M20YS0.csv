8435463,2,B004M20YS0,"Spike Jones the Legend had two of the three tracks on Wild Music all but making this a redundant purchase notwithstanding the amazon promotion stating other buyers bought both.  I guess I was just as gullible as the ""other buyers"".",1464652800,,231,4.775

8435465,5,B004M20YS0,I have always enjoyed spike. These musicians are top professional's to be able to perform as they do. It's a DVD. And able to see all the action Great price. Very entertaining.,1441238400,,176,4.53125
8435466,5,B004M20YS0,A genius of the musical abstract still yet to be discovered by many.  This kind of musical talent never goes out of style.,1384128000,,122,4.304347826086956
8435467,5,B004M20YS0,"I vaguely remembered watching Spike Jones as a child.  I remember his band/orchestra played lots of fun stuff.  Once I got this dvd the memories became clearer and clearer.  The band has some great musicians that also take part as actors in lots of hilarious slap-stick comedy skits.  Then, there is Spike playing his crazy xylophone and shooting off his starter pistol, while all the time chomping on  gum.  He is also actively involved in skits too.  He seemed to always have visits from various popular ""stars"" of the day, along with a variety of other entertaining acts. Though in B&W, the video quality is very adequate and brings with it plenty of nostalgia.  I wish my Dad were alive to relive the fun with me.  I ordered a copy for an old high school friend, a fellow trumpeter in a little dance orchestra we were in ""way back when"".  I know he, his wife, and his Mother (who is still living) will flip over being able to once again see Spike Jones.  It is unfortunate that many in our present day never had the opportunity to see him, and probably have never even heard of him--oh, the fun they missed.",1380672000,3,1111,4.477611940298507
8435468,4,B004M20YS0,"As a member of a much younger generation, this sort of entertainment is something that I have never really experienced. The picture and sound quality are not great, and at times things move more slowly than I am used to. Additionally, there are plenty of celebrity references that don't mean anything to me. That being said, I found  the humor in these videos to be satisfying. The musicians are tremendously talented, the scene changes are impressive, and the ""special effects"" are very inventive.
Spike Jones was something of a genius in terms of his ability to transport his audience in spite of the technological constraints. Very enjoyable to those looking for something entertaining and who aren't too put off by black and white picture!",1378252800,2,743,4.991935483870968
8435469,4,B004M20YS0,"I purchased this DVD in the hopes that it would offer very different offerings than the three VHS tapes I have of Spike & his band (Spike Jones and His Band, Volumes 1, 2 & 3) but it mostly a repeat. And, I don't think that the visual quality is better either.

That said, I use selected segments of Spike's work (?) when I teach music in elementary school to simply illustrate that music and musicianship can be fun.  For me, and for my students, it is valuable mayhem.",1362441600,5,470,4.269662921348314
8435470,4,B004M20YS0,"If you don't already have the expensive set Spike Jones The Legend, this is an inexpensive way to get most of the content of that set. This DVD has 4 shows, two All-Star Revues and two Colgate Comedy Hours. The video quality is almost as good as the expensive set; in fact, if you are bothered by grainy film, you may prefer this DVD, since a lot of the grain has been eliminated here. It still doesn't qualify as a real restoration of these films, but it is very watchable.",1322524800,14,474,4.277777777777778
