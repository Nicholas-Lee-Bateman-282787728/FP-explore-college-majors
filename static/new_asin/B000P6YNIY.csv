8189886,5,B000P6YNIY,So my kids love these so much that this is to replace the VHS we had when they were little.  My daughters that are 17 and 22 still watch these and sing the songs all of the time.,1515369600,,178,3.6842105263157894
8189887,5,B000P6YNIY,"I was loaned another Liken video and fell in love with the quality, humor, and yet seriousness of each film and got my own complete series little by little but have had to replace my copies little by little because people ""forget to return"" when I've loaned them my copies so I now keep a ""lending list"" of when I loan them and to whom.",1362960000,,336,4.184615384615385
8189888,5,B000P6YNIY,"This DVD has something to hold the attention of all ages. My husband and I are grandparents and this DVD enthralled us as much as our children and grandchildren of various ages. The music, story, and humor are exceptional! Buy it and you'll love it.",1190246400,2,249,4.555555555555555
8189889,5,B000P6YNIY,"I have to admit, my favorite part of this movie is the song ""Here Waiting,"" which is done boy-band style. It's clean, fun, and just plain cool.  However, even with the silliness, there is a great reverence in this movie that teaches about the Lord's love and these people's faith. You won't regret this purchase, or any in the Liken series!",1179446400,,340,4.573770491803279
