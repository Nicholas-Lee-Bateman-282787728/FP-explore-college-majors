1902921,5,B0000A59W4,"I recommend this video for a newbie who wants an easy way to start exercising, or for a pro who just wants to get in a quick 15-minute workout in the comfort of her/his own home.
I live in a second-floor apartment, so I was concerned about getting a good exercise video that wouldn't disturb my downstairs neighbors.  WATP is great for this reason.  The moves never require a lot of bouncing around.  The video requires you to walk in place, and alternate this with various stretches.
I never thought the video was too tough; in fact, it was a simple motivating workout with just the right intensity level I was looking for.
I'd especially recommend the WATP Success 3-pack of videos that comes with the ""Stretchie"" band.  This set includes the one-mile walk, as well as two-mile and three-mile walks.",1062547200,,801,4.659574468085107

7995947,5,B0000A59W4,"This is an older Leslie workout and I think it is better than some of her newer ones.  She has her regular 'signature' steps, but adds a little variety to all of them.  I recognize her 'old gang' doing the walks, and everyone looks so young!  You can't beat the price, and it comes with a very nice stretch band.",1456876800,3,312,4.166666666666667
7995948,4,B0000A59W4,I like Leslie Sansone workouts. The Walk Away the Pounds Express  is on another video of hers that I already have though.,1398556800,,121,4.5

7995951,5,B0000A59W4,"I love having a 4 mile walk that doesn't use stretch bands or weights. This video is one of Leslie's better workouts. Now, Leslie could talk a lot less but then boredom would set in. There are no new moves in this workout. Just plain exhilarating,heart pumping fun. After completing this 4 mile walk you will feel on top of game for duration of the day.",1281916800,3,353,4.363636363636363
7995952,5,B0000A59W4,"Another great walking program by Leslie! And it's nice to have the variety of the stretchie band in this 3 mile walk, adding more benefits.",1176681600,,139,4.6
7995953,5,B0000A59W4,"Easy walk is a simple cardio walking workout which also incorporates a strechie band to work on upper body strengthening as you walk. The program contains about 16 minutes of walking followed by a 2 minute stretch. The walking part includes Leslie's 4 basic steps--walk (march), side step, front kick, and knee up--and spends some time at a brisker pace, although Leslie constantly encourages you to go at your own pace. The band is used for just a few exercises in the second half mile; you can change the resistance on the band, substitute light dumbbells, or skip the band altogether.  This would be an especially nice program for beginners, although more advanced exercises can up the intensity and still work up a sweat.  Highly recommended.",1118361600,2,746,4.912698412698413
7995954,4,B0000A59W4,"I am a busy mom with a 3 year old son, and I find it very difficult to exercise on a regular basis. I purchased this video because of the positive reviews I read here at Amazon and because the video is quite short (15 minutes). I figured I'd have no excuses to skip exercising anymore. And you know, I was right.

This video is terrific for someone who isn't used to exercising regularly. It starts out with a very comfortable walking pace. During the warm up, Leslie shows you the different variations on the walking steps you will use. Although she doesn't cover them all right here, they are EASY. As you reach the 1/2 mile point, a progress bar appears on the screen. The walk becomes brisker in the middle and can be a little bit hard to keep up with on your first viewing, but it isn't important to be exactly in step with the video. As Leslie emphasises, the point is to keep moving.

The video features a lot of people (age 27 to 70 as I recall), and with a range of body shapes and sizes. Leslie is bubbly, but not too annoying, and she is middle aged. Yay! (She's a far cry from a 20-somthing twinkie in a thong leotard). You can't help but be inspired by all the walkers on this video. They all seem to care about themselves.

The cool down portion of the video features optional exercises you can do with your arms while walking. They require a stretchy fitness band (that I believe comes with the video when purchased new, although I got mine from an Amazon Marketplace seller used). It's somewhat tricky to do the exercises and stay in step, so I usually stop trying to keep pace with the other walkers at this point. It's the cool down anyway. At the end of the video, you feel as if you've really gotten active, and best of all, you only needed to find room for 15 minutes out of your day.

I would have given this video 5 stars, but I am not happy with some of the music used during the walk. I feel they should have chosen something with a very strong beat so that I can turn down the volume and still be able to follow it (what if I want to exercise while my son naps?). However, to their credit, they don't make you listen to the same monotonous music the whole time.

Give this video a try before you say you don't have time to exercise!",1092355200,16,2258,4.217592592592593
