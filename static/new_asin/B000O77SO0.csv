2791685,5,B000O77SO0,"The Fall Guy on DVD is long overdue! I was so happy to see that it will, in fact, be released on DVD this year (2007)!

The Dukes of Hazzard, The A-Team, Knight Rider, Six MIllion Dollar Man, Charie's Angels and so many others couldn't hold a candle to The Fall Guy and Colt Seavers!!

Featuring a hot, talented cast and the most action that can be held in 50 mins...the Fall Guy is and always will be the leader of the pack!

Maybe not the originator..but most definetely the best!!",1174694400,16,483,4.285714285714286

2791696,5,B000O77SO0,"This was one of the shows that I grew up with.... my buddy and I wanted to be stuntmen after watching this show, and even had Fall Guy Stunt Assoc. jackets made up, which was followed by ""actions without thinking"", such as: Jumping our bikes too far, or off hazardous environments, or jumping off highpoints onto solid grounds, being dragged by cars, and other stupid teenage boy stuff. I honestly have to say its amazing we didn't end up in traction! So when I spotted this DVD, it was a must have down memory lane (without the stupidness) purchase.... Sure some of the plots are kind of silly, it was TV at the time, but its innocent and fun! Hey guys, when it Season 2?????",1479340800,2,676,4.416

2791732,4,B000O77SO0,"The show still stands up to the test of time, despite the fact that when I originally watched it I was in grade school. It is fun and lighthearted, which is what I think the producers and creative staff wanted to do. The genius of the show is to put a stuntman front and center as the protagonist. Lee Majors is a great choice for the role, and the supporting characters do a great job as well. If you are wondering in what episode you can see Heather Thomas coming through the double doors in a polka dot blue bikini, that would be Season 1, Episode 12.  The show also features a great theme song, sung by Majors himself. Especially in this first season you get to see many cameos by friends (and a former lover) of Majors.",1436054400,8,724,4.246376811594203

2791737,5,B000O77SO0,"The first couple seasons of this show are classic 80s TV, and as an added bonus you get to see Heather Thomas in multiple bikinis.

I have fond memories of this show and even the when it was cheesy it wasn't as bad as I remembered. If you liked the show, pick up season 1. The later seasons lost their way, but the first couple... poifect.",1429747200,,339,4.136363636363637

2791740,5,B000O77SO0,Don't recall seeing this series from the early 80's but I like it a lot.

2791744,5,B000O77SO0,"Wow!!! Finally I do remember The Fall Guy from back in the day growing up as a kid from the 80's On Miss Heather Thomas for her most notable role on a TV show as Jody Banks, She was red hot and super sexy from back in the day. She was cast on the show and she previously guest starred on five TV shows from 1978-80. Also, She was one of the hosts on Talking With a Giant (1971) at the tender age of 14 in her earlier career, She'd later guest starred on 12 other TV shows in the later years of her acting career and 7 film appearances until she'd quit acting in 1998. She'd appeared on numerous pin-up posters throughout the 1980's as a pin-up model back then. Today, She's now at Age 57 as a screenwriter, author, actress, guest star, guest and former pin-up model and currently married to Skip Brittenham (1992-present day). On Lee Majors, He'd put in a five-year successful run on the sci-fi fantasy TV show The Six Million Dollar Man and also as TV director (1973-1978). Now stars as ""The Unknown Stuntman"" Colt Seavers in this five-year run hit TV show with notable guest from The Jackson Family singer, actress and model LeToya Jackson guest stars.

The show was originally aired on ABC from 1981-86 and in year two, Markie Post later joined the cast until 1986 and she'd moved on and was cast on the primetime NBC sitcom Night Court (1983-93) as Attorney Christine Sullivan.",1425081600,,1381,4.437007874015748
2791745,5,B000O77SO0,Loved this show growing up. As soon as the opening song played it brings you back in time and makes you smile. The 80's shows were the best.,1424908800,,140,4.035714285714286

2791775,5,B000O77SO0,I love The Fall Guy. But of course I love Lee Majors. I'm hoping that more cd's become available for this show. But for now I'm enjoying the episodes on Amazon instant video. Thank you for offering them,1359158400,,202,4.342105263157895
2791776,5,B000O77SO0,"The fall guy is quintessential 80s TV at its best. It is humor action adventure and just plain old fun. Now if they would just release the rest of the seasons two through five, that would make me happy.",1358294400,,202,4.205128205128205

2791778,5,B000O77SO0,"Have the first season, but whats really pricking me off is  the later seasons of FALL GUY are only being released overseas. I've seen european releases PAL-region 2, but their always out of stock before I can order them, so whats the deal? this has been true with a number of American TV series like baywatch....etc they only release the first 1 or 2 seasons here then it goes overseas.
Bring the good TV series back to America!",1351987200,,428,4.487179487179487

2791780,5,B000O77SO0,"Too funny!  A country singer punches out his limo driver and gets his underling to confess to the assault.  The limo driver dies and Colt just about is eaten by a lion, his truck is out of commission.  He and Howie have their hands more than full in this hilarious tale.  I won't tell it all--get it and  see it for yourself.

I want the whole thing. This is the best show I have ever watched.

Lee Majors ought to be in charge of TV!
If I could give it 10 stars, I would.",1330905600,,262,4.038461538461538
2791793,5,B000O77SO0,"I just loved the Fall Guy when I was in high school, and was very excited that they finally released season one. Season two was released in the UK.  I am very disappointed that they still have not released the rest of the series.  I think it's a shame that fans are left with an incomplete collection.  Unlike other TV shows The Fall Guy only got better as the seasons went along.",1322870400,,380,4.25
2791794,4,B000O77SO0,"Nice to have this series available on DVD. No heavy life lessons here (well, maybe a few if you look between the lines and inside Colt Seavers' battered but generous heart). Just a lot of wrecked cars and snappy dialog and wretched bad guys, along with an appealing cast and leading man. The real highlights are the many cameos by stars past and present (James Coburn, Farrah Fawcett, Milton Berle, Tom Selleck etc. ). Never know who will show up next. Nice DVD transfer and the discs include a short feature on the making of the series with interviews with Lee Majors, Heather Thomas and the series creator Glen Larson.  Oh yeah, and that theme song is still darn catchy 30 years later...still rattling around my head even now.  Great memories of a time when you could switch on the TV and lose yourself in a slightly amped up version of the real world where the girls are always  beautiful and the bad guys are always brought to justice by determined but vulnerable heroes like Colt Seavers. Nice to have him back.",1322697600,2,1016,4.571428571428571
2791795,5,B000O77SO0,"I've been wanting this set for quite a while and at this price, it was a no-brainer.  I have fond memories of watching this as a kid and I was not disappointed when I sat down and burned through the first two DVDs in one night.  Yes, it is cheesy, but it is a fun watch and getting to introduce my son to the Fall Guy is absolutely priceless for me.

Now, if they would just get around and release the rest of the series, I would be a very happy man.",1321833600,,450,3.869565217391304
2791796,5,B000O77SO0,"I just bought the first season and cracked it open the day it arrived.  I forgot how much I enjoyed this show.  Right from the opening credits I was transported back to 1984.  The plots, humor, stunts and oh yea...I also forgot how insanely hot Heather Thomas was in that show. Watching her stroll through those bat wing doors made the purchase worth every penny. Can't wait for the other seasons.",1309564800,,397,4.563380281690141

2791798,5,B000O77SO0,"Great rainy-day viewing; Lee Majors is even better in this show than in the 6 million dollar man. And when this show came out, I had a crush on Heather Thomas like you wouldn't believe....",1302825600,,188,4.4
2791799,5,B000O77SO0,"Lee Majors followed up his role in ""The 6 Million Dollar"" man with this very fun series about a stunt man who makes ends meet by doing some bounty hunting at the same time. A real treat in the show was Heather Thomas (often confused with Heather Locklear of TJ Hooker and Dynasty fame).

I give this show its stars not for outstanding acting or rock solid plotting, and especially not because of Lee Majors' singing talents in the theme song LOL, but because this was a very original premise and they made it work. You've got a bit of a PI show combined with a bit of Mission Impossible and a large dose of action movies ... all in one.

Lee Majors was in the sweet spot of his career after his success as the Bionic Man. He was very entertaining in this role, with a rugged physique to go with his good looks that made him entirely believable for the character. This character's name, Colt Seavers, added to the atmosphere. Douglas Barr added to the mix as Colt's affable sidekick, and The Fall Guy also provided an early look at Markie Post, before her well known run on Night Court.

The show is sheer laid back escapism, and certainly worth a look if you didn't get your fill of it in the early 80s.",1299628800,,1203,4.314159292035399
2791800,5,B000O77SO0,My husband absolutely LOVES these dvd's. His only problem is only season one is available. Amazon needs to get the rest of the seasons.,1298332800,,135,4.666666666666667
2791801,5,B000O77SO0,"This first season of FALL GUY is available as volumes 1 and 2.  You have to buy both to enjoy the entire first season.  As an ardent fan of the FALL GUY (Lee Major's best TV series, even over the SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN) I was not disappointed.  Now that I have watched the entire two-volume set of the first season, I'm wondering if they will produce seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5!  It's really too bad if they don't produce the entire 5-year seasons.  It leaves those of us hankering for more left in the lurch.",1295568000,,505,4.164948453608248
2791802,5,B000O77SO0,"Yes, even after almost 30 years, the Fall Guy still makes me hang to my TV set! I was a fan then and I am still now and not just for the lovely Heather Thomas! Actually, I wish I had a truck just like Colt's, I do own a GMC truck but It doesn't have the suspension kit nor the big tires and roll bar. I have to admit that this truck was part of what made watch this every week back then but the formula was kind of origninal being the story of a hollywood stunman who actually earn revenu during his cinema break working as a bounty hunter. Of course, sometimes you can see it coming...but some other times, you get suprised as how the story turn and end up! The DVD comes in a neat box and work very well, these DVDs gave me the opportunity to watch the pilot episode of the serie which I missed when the show was aired on tV in the 80's. There are of course a few extra on the DVD like interview with Lee Majors and Glen Larson. All in all, I am absolutely satisfied of my purchase and I intend to buy the rest of what is available of that TV show. I also would like to warn potentiel buyer's of the fall guy serie, I myself went for an offer on the net for the complete serie on DVD. The price was $50.00 wich I considered a real deal for so many DVD discs but there was a catch! All of theses DVDs were cheap (and I mean cheap) copies who's quality wasn't even worth the price of the disc they were on!!! So if you are to buy some DVDs of the fall guy, go for the originals wich are of prefect quality and buy them wright here at amazone, the trouble free market place!

Here it is 25 years later, and I am enjoying it even more now than I did then. The Fall Guy is unique in today's world of reality TV, game shows, and who wants a new mommy or babysitter...whatever. The Fall Guy featured lots of action, with a few awesome stunts, some gold old fashion bare-knuckle brawling, and sexy women. Yet somehow, the show was clean, good natured, and the good guy wins. It seems Hollywood just can make shows this enjoyable anymore. If you watched The Fall Guy when it aired, then this DVD set is a complete no brainer. If you have never seen it, I would suggest maybe buying one episode through Amazon's video on demand so you can get a feel for the show. Trust me; you will want to get the entire season on DVD! I am looking forward now to getting Season 2, and eventually the complete series collection. If you have kids, please consider introducing them to The Fall Guy. I think it's something they will really enjoy, and it can teach them a thing or two about doing what's right as well. That's hard to find on television these days! In the meantime, I will enjoy watching this season a few times and feeling young again.

The whole family would sit in front of the television to see this show.  This is wonderful for Fall Guy fans.  Sure, the scripts were not Emmy award winning, and the acting was not Emmy award winning, but people tuned in to see light-hearted entertainment and action.  It had no message, but we didn't expect it to have one, we just enjoyed the ride. It was fun.  We got to see Lee Majors, car chases, and older actors from the sixties and seventies that you didn't see anymore. They had a soundtrack of popular music of the eighties in many episodes.

I saw this show for the first time when I was a child and it was airing on television and I liked it then and rewatching it many years later on DVD, it still holds up pretty well. The show is a nice blend of comedy and action, with some truly amazing stunts. Given the fact that the stories were written in the 1980's, they're not too bad, and the three leads, Majors, Douglas Barr and Heather Thomas, are all likeable. And finally, this show has one of the best television theme songs ever. If you don't find yourself singing along by the final episode, I'd be surprised.",1212537600,,799,4.333333333333333
2791832,1,B000O77SO0,"I am disappointed. The reason is simple.
I have literally waited and waited for a video release of the Fall guy, and then waited and hoped it will come out on DVD, for decades!
Then one day - VOILA - I see it, I buy it, and I regret it. I was thinking ""I cant believe it, this is so good!"" And unfortunately it was too good to be true. In the title it says the ""COMPLETE Series 1"", and nothing can be further from COMPLETE than what can be found in this load of rubbish!
Every single song has been either chopped up (to the point that you get the feeling the camera operator might have been drunk) OR the song has been completely replaced with a GENERIC imitation with different melody and lyrics to the song that was originally used.
Now this is NOT A MUSICAL SHOW. However, this is history. The DVD is supposed to be a representation of a particular way of life and way of thinking in society at a particular point in time.
Instead of getting an artists work', we get a version of a corporate executive's greed. Enjoy the show!!
This show must be retitled, removed the word COMPLETE from the subtitle, and all artwork resembling the show changed to more GENERIC ACTION MOVIE images, from the front cover.
This is NOT the Fall Guy.",1208131200,7,1232,4.314655172413793

In the pilot movie, during the bar fight scene, you'll notice the band performing in the background is blurred out, and there's some strange editing going on.  Fox was trying to hide the fact that they replaced and edited out Paul Williams singing the Patsy Cline hit ""Crazy"", and the acting scenes he had before and during the fight.  Since all traces of Paul Williams were edited out, his name was removed from the guest star credits at the beginning of the movie, and the song credit for ""Crazy"" was edited out of the end credits.

There's no mention of music replacement on the back of the box, but in their review of the set, TVShowsOnDVD provided some information that may indicate lots more music replacements in the set:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chris Cook dug up some information from NOMA Music and posted it to the Home Theater Forum. NOMA posted this on their website: ""20th Century Fox home video release of ""The Fall Guy"" starring Lee Majors features eight new songs by Robert Allen, Octane Saints, Don Fisher and Matt King."" This, coupled with the odd scene from the pilot, leads me to believe there were some music replacements on the set.

I watched the DVD episode a little more and noticed more instances of music replacement, such as during the restaurant fight, and some score music removed before and after that scene.  There are probably lots more, but it would take a lot of effort to compile a complete list.

I taped this episode many years ago in syndication, and although the quality of my copy sucks (it was before I had cable), I have to keep it because it's a more complete copy than what's on the DVD.

It makes me mad that not only did Fox not mention the music replacement on the packaging (reminds me of Anchor Bay with the Grounded For Life sets), AND edit out all of Paul Williams' acting scenes, but that they're charging more than usual for the set - even going so far as to split it into two volumes to make it more affordable - which I presumed was due to music rights, but now I can only assume that greed was the motive.",1207612800,7,2917,5.303687635574837

2791848,5,B000O77SO0,As good as I remembered. They did a great job on the transfer. The picture and sound are crystal clear. I was happy to see that they added a couple of featurettes and was pleasantly surprise that Heather and Lee shared some of their memories. Too bad Doug didn't make an appearance though. Hope they bring the whole series to DVD!,1205193600,4,330,4.426229508196721

Not only was the price very reasonable, especially compared to other places (which it was priced way too high!) The episodes are top notch, and the quality is very good. They just don't make television shows like this these days, mainly because they would be too expensive to produce.
  In addition, the storylines were very well written, and there were many great guest stars. Lee Majors certainly played the part very well, and it is also great for the nostalgia factor. Shows like these take you back to a more simple time, an era where television had to be good!",1201046400,,705,4.67741935483871
2791851,4,B000O77SO0,"This abbreviated 1981-82 Season DVD of the FALL GUY was probably my favorite season throughout it's whole 5-year run on ABC, since it seemed to show Colt Seavers(Lee Majors) hot and snazzy '81 GMC 4X4 Sierra Grande pick up more often and Colt's truck was probably shown in the 1st Season more often than it was shown in the remaining 4 seasons, plus I always liked watching Colt chasing the goones or being chased by criminals in his awesome pretty truck as well, despite the fact that Colt would either end up losing the bad guys a lot or wrecking his truck a lot in the process and sometimes Colt's pick up would even end up getting damaged while being chased by crooks trying to kill him even when he'd shake them off with his truck, since Colt's pick up was usually more upgraded with more advantages than the vehicles Colt would chase or be chased by.

Additionally, this 1981-82 Season was also the season when Colt Seavers bitchin 4X4 GMC Sierra Grande was brand spankin new and when Big Jack(Joanne Pflug) was Colt and Howie's agent, which was replaced by Terri Michaels(Markie Post)in the Second Season.

FALL GUY's 1981-82 Season also had a lot of interesting guest stars like
*Comedian Buddy Hackett in ""The Adventures Of Ozzie & Harold"" episode.

*Heather Locklear in the ""Scavenger Hunt"" episode during her co-starring days as the greedy Sammy Jo on DYNASTY and Hooker & Romano's spunky fellow cop(Officer Stacey Sheridan)on TJ HOOKER

*Morgan Woodward in the ""Snow Job"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS.

*Judith Chapman in ""The Rich Get Richer"", ""Goin For It"", and ""Three For The Road"" episodes before her days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS & DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Brianne Leary in ""The Human Torch"" episode after her co-starring days as California Highway Patrol Officer Sindy Cahill on CHiPs

*Monte Markham in the ""License To Kill"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Thorpe on BAYWATCH

*Anne Lockhart in the ""Snow Job"" episode after her co-starring days as Lt. Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*David Hedison in the ""Snow Job"" episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

*Mary Frances Crosby in the ""Ready, Aim, Die"" episode during her co-starring days on DALLAS

*Country Western singer(Mickey Gilley) in ""The Silent Partner"" episode

*Douglas McClure in the ""Scavenger hunt"" episode before his co-starring days as Mayor Applegate on OUT OF THIS WORLD

*Richard Moll in ""The Human Torch"" episode before his co-starring days as baliff Bull Shannon on NIGHT COURT

*Eddie Albert in the pilot episode after his co-starring days on GREEN ACRES

FALL GUY's First Season also had some interesting cameo apperances done by
*Lee Majors ex-wife(Farrah Fawcett)in the pilot episode after her co-starring days on CHARLIE'S ANGELS

*Kathy Lee Crosby from THAT'S INCREDIBLE in the ""No Way Out"" episode

*Tom Selleck filming on location for MAGNUM, P.I. in the ""License To Kill"" episode

*Robert Wagner from HART TO HART in ""The Meek Shall Inherit Rhonda"" episode

*Jim Coburn from DALLAS in the pilot episode

*Linda Evans during her co-starring days as Krystle Jennings on DYNASTY in the ""Colts Angels"" episode

*Lou Ferrigno filming on location for THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the ""License To Kill"" episode

*Milton Berle in the ""Rich Get Richer"" episode

*Paul Williams in the pilot episode

Additionally; this season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when the FALL GUY was part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up starting with the GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM; followed by the FALL GUY at 9PM; and then topped off with DYNASTY at 10PM; which gave me something to look forward to every Wednesday other than the fact that Wednesday is hump day, since Wednesday is the middle of the work week for me as well as most other people, since Wednesday means the week is halfway over.

This DVD also contains a bonus material segment showing Lee Majors(Colt Seavers), Doug Barr(Howie Munson), and Heather Thomas(Jody Banks) talking about their days co-starring on the FALL GUY looking back on it, which also explained how this show had a contract with General Motors to use at least several GMC trucks to do their stunts with, since the stunts wreaked havoc on all the pick ups they used to do the stunts with, just like all the stunts Bo and Luke did with the General Lee wreaked havoc on all the '69 Dodge Chargers they used for their stunts on the DUKES OF HAZZARD and just like all the stunts that KITT made on KNIGHT RIDER wreaked havoc on all the '82 Pontiac Trans Ams they used to run that show, but Colt's pick up definetly outclassed the General Lee.

THE FALL GUY's 1st Season also takes me all the way down to memory lane when Ronald Reagan was president and when we had all those budget cuts going on back then during the recession in 1981-1982, which reminds me that ABC's motto at the time during this season of the FALL GUY was ""Now Is The Time, ABC Is The Place"".

It was also cool being able to watch all these episodes complete & uncut without all those additional commercial disruptions you'd get watching FALL GUY in reruns, especially when it was on FX from 1995-98.

So now that they've already had the FALL GUY's 1981-82 Season out on DVD for over a year now, I don't see what's taking them so long to bring the FALL GUY's 1982-83 Season out on DVD and I can hardly wait till the FALL GUY-Season 2 gets released either, which will hopefully be released by the end of this year(2008) along with the fact that the FALL GUYs Second Season DVD would make a nice X-Mas present for this year.",1200528000,3,5556,4.72360248447205

2791855,3,B000O77SO0,"I was a little disappointed when I got this show on dvd. I watched it as a kid, and thought it was such a great show. I always liked the friction between Howie and Colt, and how they were always making me laugh. They were always complete opposites, and it's what made the show work. I don't remember the show too much though from when I was a kid other than catching a few reruns here or there on tv. But what I was disappointed with this season is Markie Post hasn't came into the show yet, which I remember her being a big part of the show, and also the writing of the episodes hasn't really come along yet.

I remember the episodes being cleverly written, and didn't drag. I found quite a few episode towards the end of the season really dragged, and were quite boring. The humour was put a bit on the backburner, and got more serious with the stories, which really weren't all that interesting to begin with. The series really started off well, and had a great mix of fun stories in the episode, as well as some good humour. For instance in the pilot episode when Howie gets punched by Colt, and asks if it was some kind of test you give stuntmen, and Colt says no, that's just me trying to knock your head off!, and also when Howie asks if Colt wants him to store this gear in that shed, and Colt says THAT AIN'T A SHED, THAT'S MY HOUSE! lol

I found stuff like that really added to the episodes, and kept you laughing right till the end. I'm not really disappointed with the set in general, other than I heard there was some music substitutions and in the Pilot episode you can clearly see the band in the background of a bar blurred out for whatever reason, which is kind of stupid. I think I was more disappointed with the price of the set, which was around 60 bucks, and the lack of quality in some of the episodes.

so I recommend this set to any fans of the series, but I don't think this is the best season of the show, I remember the seasons after this being a lot more focused, and had better episodes.",1196294400,4,2016,4.190721649484536

The show itself doesn't disappoint.  Classic 80's TV.  Yes, the effects are rather cheesy compared to today's high tech stuff and yes, you can definitely see where the ""stock footage"" comes in, but if you take it for what it is, it's super enjoyable.  I know it never fails to bring a smile to my face!  I got it while deployed to Iraq and the scenery made me ache for home.
Bottom line, if you're looking for a blast from the past, you've got it right here.  I just hope that all the seasons of this classic show end up on DVD!",1193875200,2,663,3.9398496240601504
2791867,5,B000O77SO0,"Welcome to the full first season of The Fall Guy.  This is an 80's TV show that is a bit cheesy but lots of fun.

Colt Seavers (Lee Majors) is a professional stunt man. But like most people in the entertainment business, he finds that doesn't cover all of his bills. So he also works as a bounty hunter for bail bondswoman Samantha Jack (Jo Ann Pflug). Helping him out are his cousin Howie (Douglas Barr) and his protege Jody (Heather Thomas). And it's a good thing he can do stunts, too, because that ability comes in mighty handy when the crooks run.

This is an action show.  And when you consider this was a TV show, it's pretty amazing the stunts they do.  Each episode usually features one movie stunt and then several more ""real life"" stunts as Colt works to catch his man.  While we get plenty of car chases and jumps, there are some truly spectacular stunts, especially in the first half.

The cast does a great job and they are obviously having fun together.  Unfortunately, Heather Thomas is underused as Jody, sometimes being reduced to just a cameo.  And speaking of cameos, they've got an impressive list of cameos from Tom Selleck to Farrah Fawcette and Herve Villechaize.

This season of the show got three releases, this set and two sets that broke the season up into two halves.  I recommend this set.  It contains everything from those two sets at the same price.  Why get two when you can get one?

This is a guy's action show with impressive stunts.  It's 80's television, but still lots of fun today.",1193875200,3,1522,4.5036496350364965

Okay, so this is a total guy show with all the action.  But it is a fun guy show.  And there are all the cameos, from Farrah Fawcett to Tom Selleck and Lou Ferrigno.

Fox did three releases for the first season, a complete season set, plus the season divided into two halves.  This is the first half of the season.  You get eleven episodes, including the double length pilot.  In those episodes, Colt goes to Hawaii twice, gets caught up in international intrigue, hunts down a white collar criminal, and tangles with the mob in Vegas to name a few things.  You also get a bonus featurette, interviews with creator Glen Larson and series stars Lee Majors and Heather Thomas about how the series came to be.

If you are on a tight budget this may be the way to go.  But if you are a true fan of the show, look for the full season set.",1190160000,,1466,4.330882352941177

2791872,1,B000O77SO0,"After watching all but three episodes of the first season, I only have one thing to say. SUCKS!!! This is without a doubt one of the worst, stupidest shows ever made. Or at least that's what I think of Season 1. When you thik of The Fall Guy your first impressions are thrilling stunts, explosions, action, and babes at every corner. Don't be fooled. Season 1 of this very kiddish show has very little action and most of the stunts in the show happen with rear-end projection in the background. Every episode has the same story and idiotic characters. I'm extremly disappointed with Season 1 of this pathetic show. The fan base this show attracts are of mindless people. The only thing I enjoy in this stupid show is Heather Thomas. A beauty she is, with a nice body, however, she's hardly in any of the episodes. I think Lee Majors didn't want her to upstage him in every scene. Because she does when she is on screen. I have a rule though when I buy tv shows on dvd. The first season in shows are always bad, with a few exceptions. So I'll give The Fall Guy another chance when they release Season 2 on DVD. After that if that fails then you know the answer after that. The whole show SUCKS!!!",1187827200,,1195,4.36322869955157

My only complaint? That whole extra where the original writer of ""The Unknown Stuntman"" sings the theme his way. Colt Seavers did it a lot better.

This DVD  offers full screen and mono audio, and it does not provide today's standard such as widescreen or multi audio channels (not even stereo)

Ironically, it did not bother me at all because that was how I watched the show back then.  This show turns out to be retro classic.  It is unfortunate that we no longer see those old fashioned good tough ole boy like Colt Seavers on TV today, and it is priceless watching Lee Majors in action on this DVD.",1181347200,3,599,4.165217391304348

2791879,5,B000O77SO0,"I have not watched anything yet but the featurette about the theme song, but wanted to say that I loved the series and am glad it is on DVD. I hope they do them all. I have loved this show since I saw Heather Thomases first poster (with the fall guy pickup truck) in at 3D 20 some odd years ago. But lest, you think she was the only reason to watch, I truly liked the show. She is just what made this guy check out the show when he was around 13-14.

A few points I did notice was that there are three separate DVD cases (holding 2 discs each). There is no booklet telling about the series, but on the back of each cover it lists the episode title, original airdate and a brief (one sentence or so) description of the plot. In some ways this is better, but I would have liked to have had a little more in the way of info although a lot of sets that have booklets probably don't give this much or a whole lot more. Maybe one of the bonuses will tell more. Bonus items are a featurette on the theme song (with Lee Majors and others) and ""remembering the fall guy"" (Which I haven't watched yet.)

I was really surprised at Lee Majors though. He is thinner (from what I saw), older (of course) but his voice also is pitched higher. I truly had to do a double take. I am pleased that he was involved in this and hope he is doing well.",1181001600,6,1329,4.03030303030303
2791880,5,B000O77SO0,"The Fall Guy was one of eighties best all-around action series. Yes, there're so many other classic series. But, for pure entertainment value, I ranked The Fall Guy with The A-Team, two of the best eighties action series. Lee Majors really shines with stunt man Colt role. I'm a big fan of Six Million Dollar Man series, but I think The Fall Guy is Major's finest role ever. He had fun with this series, you can feel it. He enjoyed every second of it, and viewers, too.

Lee Majors sings title song for this series. The Fall Guy theme was one of my favorite eighties tv theme songs. It's catchy pop-country style song. And I remember saw Majors sings The Fall Guy song for Solid Gold. Yes, you remember Solid Gold. I remember, too. Fun show, lots of stars and those dancers! Hey, Lee Majors sings himself, what a great moment that was.

So, if you've seen this great show already, I think this dvd set is a great collection. If you haven't seen it, give it a try. This set is vol. 1 of The Fall Guy season. 1 There're vol. 2 is also available. And, entire season. 1 set also pre-order right now. Price is all the same, so choice is yours.

2791883,5,B000O77SO0,"This is one of my favorite Action/Adventure series. I love the Theme ""The Unknown Stuntman"" by David Somerville, Gail Jensen, and Glen Larson. The theme sung by Lee Majors.

The hallmark of this series was the spectacular stunt work. For Lee Majors the show was his fifth successful show. Majors played the role as Hollywood stuntman Colt Seavers, who by using his special skills to track down and capture bail jumpers picked up a little extra money. Helping out were Colt's inexperienced but eager younger cousin, Howie, and stunning stuntwoman Jody. The team took thier assignments from Samantha Jack, a sexy bail bondswoman named ""Big Jack"".

Each episode started with one of Colt's daredevil movie stunts(usually in high-speed)and then shifted to his pursuit of the bail jumper, often using the same stunts he had used in the movie.

The Fall Guy first aired on November 4th, 1981 until May 2nd, 1986 for a total of 5 seasons and 113 episodes, which I wish to own.

The First season was up there with the best 30 TV shows, ranking 26th in its first appearance and getting 19% of viewers according the Nielsen rating (The Nielsen rating is the percent of all TV-equipped homes tuned to the program on an average night, as measured by Nielsen Media Research).

The cast for this show were:

Colt Seavers..........................Lee Majors

Howie Munson........................Douglas Barr

Jody Banks........................Heather Thomas

Samantha""Big Jack""Jack(1981-1982)...Jo Ann Pflug

Terri Shannon/Michaels(1982-1985)....Markie Post

Pearl Sperling(1985-1986).............Nedra Volz

2791885,5,B000O77SO0,"Films featuring car chases and complex ""stunts"" have long been solid attractions at the box office. Notable examples are ""Bullet"" (1968) and the ""french connection"" (1971). But it wasn't until the late 70's that big budget, formula driven, Hollywood ""stunt films"" began to have massive box office appeal. ""Smokey and the bandit"" (1977) is probably the best known and most successful of the crop. ""Bandit"" director (and former stunt man) Hal Needham quickly followed his initial success with another Hollywood ""stunt film"" titled ""Hooper"" (1978) - A film that revolved around the life of a Hollywood stunt man.

TV producer, writer, and ""Fall Guy"" creator Glen Larson became quite famous for keeping a watchful eye on ""big screen"" successes and then, with a little ingenuity, creating small screen equivalents. ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" became ""Alias Smith & Jones"", ""Star Wars"" became ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Every Which way But Loose"" became ""B.J and the Bear"" and ""The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo"", and finally, ""Hooper"" (mixed with Steve McQueen's 1980 film ""The Hunter"") became ""The Fall Guy"".

The Fall Guy certainly wasn't the first series to use a ""stunt driven"" formula to attract viewers. ""CHiPs"" and ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" had already proven the formula by featuring stunt work in most of their episodes. But, before the ""A-team"" arrived, The ""Fall Guy"" featured the most outrageous and incredible stunt work on TV. In fact, when the A-Team finally DID arrive on TV (in 1983), an early advertising campaign was launched to make DIRECT claims that it was more action packed and had better ""stunts"" than ""The Fall guy"".

Beyond its ground breaking stunt work, the Fall Guy also featured a very likable cast. Lee majors was perfectly cast as stunt man ""Colt Seavers"", a role that afforded him the opportunity to prove that he was worth much more than ""six million dollars"". The series also has the distinction of introducing the world to the first ""Heather"" of the 80's. Not ""Locklear"", but ""Thomas"". For a brief moment in time, Heather Thomas was the most popular ""babe"" in all of America. A poster featuring Heather (wearing a blue bikini) became the biggest selling poster of its kind, even surpassing the record breaking sales of the now legendary 1970's ""Farrah Fawcett"" pinup.

One cannot also forget other such notable aspects of the series such as; The theme song is actually sung by it's star, Lee Majors. Singer ""La Toya Jackson"" made a guest appearance to perform her song ""Hot Potato"" (in 1984). The ""other Heather"" of the 80's (Heather Locklear) makes an appearance in episode number 23 (""Scavenger Hunt"")!! The series also featured a pre-""night court"" Markie Post as a regular cast member (1982-85)!

The first few seasons were fresh, sometimes funny, and quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, by the time of its cancellation in 1986, the series had become quite horrible. Once groundbreaking stunts were replaced by special effects that featured badly filmed miniatures and models (I kid you not!).

This series is a great piece of 80's nostalgia and will be enjoyable viewing for those looking for harmless, escapist entertainment. I sincerely hope the DVD release is not edited in any way and I'll be updating my review as soon as it's released!

I was a bit surprised at the retail price for the complete season one box-set, and that seperate ""split volumes"" of season one will ALSO be released. I'm a firm believer that the best way to generate the most DVD sales is to avoid the split volumes approach and simply release an entire season at a decent price.
