2255377,5,B00080ZG2O,"I agree what is taking so long.  Why are we putting shows that are still currently out there on DVD but we aren't putting Lois & Clark.  I watch it religiously on TNT and I also watched it when it first came out and all seasons after that.  They took the Superman story to a whole new level.  I loved and who ever puts out these DVD's wouldn't be wasting their money.  The show is going to no longer be running on TNT and I need to have it to keep.  I would buy all 4 seasons if available.  Please, please put this out on DVD as soon as possible.",1060819200,3,546,3.909090909090909
2255378,5,B00080ZG2O,"I still watch Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman everyday on TBS and I would love to see a DVD movie of the tv show to come out! The way the 4th season ended left its viewers confused and i know i speak for all of the fans when I say, PLEASE make a Superman DVD movie!!! I love the original cast with Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, Justin Whallin, and the rest of the gang! Their on-screen chemistry is just GREAT!!!!!  Please do all the fans a favor and make a movie and end the confusion of where the baby came from!!!",1060732800,,524,4.038461538461538
2255379,5,B00080ZG2O,They need to come out with the episodes on DVD so that everyone can watch it when ever they choose.  I enjoy the show all the time. Dean Cain is a very very good superman. Please let them introduce it on DVD.,1060646400,4,208,3.9523809523809526
2255380,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman continues, even in re-runs, to be the best and most charming show on television.  I watched it as a teenager, and if TBS showed it in Atlanta, I would still be watching it.  Now TBS seems to be threatening to drop our favorite show from the airwaves.  We *cannot* lose it due to the whim of a fickle TV station--bring it to DVD.  The main message boards for the show are still growing in membership after the series has been cancelled for six years.  It's recently reached over 2000 members.  I think that this is saying something about the enduring nature of this particular show.
Dean Cain turned in excellent performances as both Clark Kent and Superman, while Teri Hatcher's performance as Lois Lane.  In fact, Ms. Hatcher's Lois Lane stands as the definiative Lois Lane.  Ms. Hatcher took what was previously a very two-dimensional character and made her into a real person.  The same can be said of Mr. Cain's dual role--both his Clark and Superman have personalities of their own, linked, but seperate.
This show remains an enduring testament to the longetivity of Superman and as an example of what a Superman television show or movie *should* be.  It took the comics revamp of the 80's and successfully translated it on to the small screen for us to enjoy.
We fans would like nothing better than it to be on DVD for us to enjoy.",1059955200,12,1384,4.612244897959184
2255381,5,B00080ZG2O,"With of all the shows that are being put on DVD, I don't understand why this one is being overlooked. Dean Cain made one of the best Clarks ever - He is the truest to the old comic books of any ""Superman"" out there. I realy think this show is the best of Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Please get it on DVD! And while your at it, release the soundtrack, too!",1059609600,5,353,3.9166666666666665
2255382,5,B00080ZG2O,"OKay,
  I know I can say this for I know that there are many fans,that loved this show as much or even more than I did. Though I probably don't love it as much as them,those who have seen this show through all it's seasons. I have now come to love it by watching it on TBS Superstation. I don't know if I could say one word to describe this sensational show. I have only seen few episodes but now watch it faithfully everday since the first time I caught a glimpse of it. This show is a true classic which many love and I hope will love for many years to come, even though it no longer runs but has re-runs. Please I'm saying this from all the fans of the show,put it on vhs and dvd!",1059436800,,683,3.9420289855072466

2255396,4,B00080ZG2O,"When this series first came out, I liked the two leads and their chemistry a lot. I also liked the humor and the relaxed nature of the show. Putative villain, Lex Luthor, was attractive. Perry White was very funny. And Clark's relationship with his parents was just so nice. Terry Hatcher was funny and sexy, and Dean Cain had a nice Aw Shucks manner. In short it was a series I could enjoy with my 10 year old daughter. It's still entertaining, if not worth $2.00 an episode. I look forward to the day when this will be a Prime feature.",1474329600,,537,4.326732673267327

But the performances are warm and fun without the dark edgy meanness that Batman can bring into a story. Dean Kane lead a cast that was fun and light without being childish or too campy. After being away from it for a few decades I am happily surprised how much fun we are having revisiting this show. Somehow we lost track of it the first time around. This is a real joy!

2255459,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is one of my favorite shows, and one that I rewatch every few years because I particularly enjoy the chemistry of the leads.

At its core, this series is a romantic adventure comedy of the mid 90s, and it comes with all the upsides and downsides of this (if the cast of characters had cell-phones available, many of the plots wouldn't work). You won't see many CGI effects, and while it's true the few you see don't necessarily age well, it's still a fun romp to enjoy. There are a lot of shows on today that are very emotionally heavy, and while I enjoy them as well, I find one of the reasons I enjoy Lois & Clark is that it's simply a fun romp, like a popcorn flick of a romantic comedy that happens to involve Superman. Many of the episodes are ""villain-of-the-week"" style stories with campy, somewhat two-dimensional characters, but it works as a serial, and there are certainly story arcs, but they don't have as much depth as say those of Smallville.

All-in-all, if you like superheroes, secret identities, romance, and the 90s, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman might be up your alley, and I would definitely recommend checking it out.

This is the only version of Superman I've ever enjoyed watching for one reason - the show focused on Clark Kent instead of the super hero. Character building is fun in this show even if the plots, special effects, and super human feats were on the corny side. I'd recommend the first season to anyone, as the cast is memorable and this is one Superman who is relatable.",1454630400,,547,4.372549019607843

2255486,5,B00080ZG2O,"My favorite superman series.  This series had humor to it that you usually do not see in superman.  The actor playing Perry White was great and his interplay with Clark, Lois and Jimmy often made me laugh. The actors playing Clark Kent's parents were extremely talented as well and this series gave you a chance to see their relationship in a way not seen in any other superman show. I loved Lex and felt the writers allowed him to be more than just a bad guy. You see him as a rich guy who was use to being top dog in town until Superman arrives to steal his thunder as well as the girl (Lois) he wants. 20 years later I am still sad it was canceled but glad Amazon has released an affordable version for fans to own.",1422662400,5,718,4.158273381294964
2255487,4,B00080ZG2O,"I grew up watching this show, so naturally I had to get it.
 Sometimes the show doesn't stand up to the test of time, and it was only good in your memories... and you discover that by rewatching the show, etc.  But thankfully that wasn't the case here for me. When I watched though the entire season, I found that it still stood up on it's own merits and were still watchable even as an adult. I never realized how many adult jokes or innuendos they put into the show until I re-watched it as an adult! So it had me chuckling at some parts as we watched Clark Kent juggle being Superman and a reporter at the same time.
  However... some parts of the show is a little dated. You can tell this was a show made in the 90's.... due to all the fashion, as well as how they incorporated some of the classic golden age comic fashion. They also play it fast and loose with the sense of timing, because you can't tell if it was a week, if a month or a year passed in that universe... which leads to Clark and Lois's relationship sometimes feeling a tad rushed, as well as Lois's relationship with Lex Luthor. well, I was given the impression that at least three months passed during season one. I could see Lex Luthor just impulsively asking Lois Lane to marry him despite the fact that they barely spent any time together... because he strikes me as the kind of rich man who just goes for anything he wants, and doesn't want to wait.  However, Having Clark Kent ask Lois to marry him too after they spent 3 months working together?
  Call me old fashioned, but I felt that there should had been more build-up between Clark Kent and Lois Lane before there was any talk of marriage between them.

 That said, those are the only complaints I had about the show... and it left me wanting more when I finished season one. So definely buying season two to see what else happens. :)",1422403200,2,1868,4.299145299145299

2255520,4,B00080ZG2O,"I'm a Superman fan from way back, having grown up watching the George Reeves series in its original showing. I fell in love with Lois & Clark right off the bat, mainly because of the pilot. The first season itself is good, but not great, hence four stars rather than five. Still, the first season is the best. I'm glad the pilot is included on the disc, because it was the one episode of the series that I would describe as truly great. It doesn't start on Krypton, or even in Smallville, but with Clark Kent's first day in Metropolis. We get to see him apply for a job at the Daily Planet. We get to see his parents worry about him being discovered every time he saves somebody. We get to see his mom help design the costume and we get to see him go into action for the first time, saving a mega-space shuttle from a bomb and then give it a boost into space. We also get to see his first meetings with Lois Lane, who worships Superman but dumps all over poor Clark, who takes it all with wit and style.

For me that pilot was just about perfect, and the guilty pleasure is because this is my favorite Superman movie. The rest of the first season is good, but I wouldn't call it great.

A quick comparison: Lois & Clark was the first screen Superman to be set in the ""new"" DC universe, which was revamped in 1986. The concept was great but the execution was less so. Whereas the comics are rich in characterization and every character recieves time of their own to be fully realized as a person with his own life, L&C slowly turns into a romance novel with all the supporting characters becoming little more that cardboard background.

And then there's Smallville. Smallville, as it must if the series is to be maintained, perverts everything so it all happens when Clark is still a teenager. They changed just about everything from the story I know and love. That said, they also do what L&C doesn't, which is to take the subject matter seriously. Lois & Clark has the concept right, but the execution was mediocre and got steadily worse. Smallville corrupts the concept, but the execution was nearly flawless. If only L&C had taken it that seriously they might have also lasted ten years.

Still, it's Superman and there's a lot of good stuff there, so I do still like it and watch on a semi-regular basis.",1391644800,,2308,4.410798122065728

2255529,5,B00080ZG2O,"Fair warning this will contain some spoilerish material so be warned....

Lois and Clark was the first live action Superman series to be on TV in decades.  It was part soap opera, part romantic comedy and part comic book action series.  The writers paid homage to the comic, but made the series around the relationship (rivals, partners, friends and romantic) between the lead characters.  It was as much (if not more so) a series about the relationship than it was about Superman.

Personally I think the first season (as with many television shows) was the best of the series.  It did take a few episodes to get its legs, but once it did, it has the best group of supporting actors, many of the best episodes and the freshest stories of the series.  Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain played the roles as well as anyone could.  They looked the parts and had great chemistry with each other.  Superman's main foil for the season was Lex Luthor, who in this version was portrayed as a billionaire philanthropist who the world saw as good, but was really a super villain.  John Shea played the part brilliantly and the series really lost something when he was no longer a regular.  He and all of the supporting cast really did help anchor the series and made it what it was.  Everyone from Lane Smith as Perry White to Michael Landes as Jimmy Olson added something. The only character that was totally ancillary was the gossip columnist Cat Grant who was only around for the first season.

The A/V quality of the DVDs were about as good as you can expect from a show that is now 20 years old.  It was just on the edge of really good special effects, and really bridged the gap effects wise between series like the Flash which was on a few years before this started and Smallville which started a few years after Lois and Clark was off the air.  As far as extras go, there is a 25 min ""making of"" feature and a 6 min feature on the special effects of the series.  There is also the 19min Comic Con presentation of the pilot that was done before the series hit TV.

All in all if you were a fan of the show, as cheesy as it could be at times, it is definitely something you want to add to you collection.  If you are really devoted to the comic books, you likely already have an opinion of the show, good or bad.  It was definitely a different take on the story, but a very enjoyable one.",1377907200,,2377,4.349206349206349

Well, I LOVED it right from the first episode, and I could not wait to continue through the entire first season.  Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are FABULOUS together, and have UNBELIEVABLY great chemistry together.  It's not as high on action and special effects as I would like, but the acting and fluffy-fun storylines make up for it.  The only detriment to the show was Tracy Scoggins as Cat, and thankfully someone recognized this fault, as the first season was her ONLY one.

2255547,4,B00080ZG2O,"To date, there have been four live action Superman series. ""The Adventures of Superman"" from the 50s with George Reeves, ""Superboy"", produced by the Salkind brothers and inspired by the success of the Christopher Reeve Superman films from the 80s, ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" from the 90s, and ""Smallville"" from decade 2000. Of these four, ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"", had the psychologically deepest, most relatable, modern, and eccentric interpretations of the classic Superman characters (Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor) seen on the small screen. Each is immature and neurotic in their own unique way. Lois, is a neurotic, romantically repressed, feminist snob living out the modern woman's dream; Clark Kent is a developmentally stunted mama's boy, living out his inner kid as Superman; Luthor is a pleasure seeking, manipulative, utilitarian, megalomaniac whose ego knows no boundaries. Each live action Superman series had its characteristic strengths and weaknesses. For ""Lois and Clark"", I'd say the strengths were the characters and the humor of the character interactions. ""Lois and Clark"", didn't feel like a traditional Superman series with stock bad guys, and Lois or Jimmy getting into trouble every episode, and needing Superman to bail them out like a good insurance policy. ""Lois and Clark"" plays out more like an episode of ""Moonlighting"", or ""The X-files"".",1363910400,,1424,5.361607142857143

2255549,4,B00080ZG2O,"This is a pretty good version of Superman, with him being a bit more willing to use his abilities as Clark Kent. The only one comparable in that fashion is, of course, Smallville. The only thing I still don't find all that good about this one is the suit. Sorry, but all I can think of is, ""Way to try and make him a sex symbol without actually getting it to happen.""

Now, I actually watched this one after watching Smallville for many years, so it was a bit different. I liked that he was flying a whole bunch in this, since Smallville had the 'no flying' thing and kept to it until the final episode (though they teased it in the middle of the final season). Terri Hatcher plays a decent Lois Lane, but after the tough-as-nails version I'd gotten used to in Smallville, every time this version of Lois broke down crying (which was at least once an episode), I groaned out of exasperation.

Suffice to say, its enjoyable, but my advice is if you've already watched Smallville and are a major fan of that, and haven't seen this one, then don't get it. You'll be disappointed with a lot.",1362960000,,1087,4.376237623762377

Now I know that Clark is who he is, and Superman is just a part he plays. But still, you're playing the most powerful being on earth. And He just doesn't quite carry it through, Now Christopher Reeves, and Gerard Christopher played both Superman and Superboy to a T. Having finished Season one, the only thing that saves it is John Shea, who played Lex Luthor. Now, to disagree with a reviewer, Perry was obsessed with Elvis, in the comic books. Again, having watched season one, and even starting season two. It juust doesn't quite, well I'll put it this way. As one person said, I understand that they wanted to focus on Lois and Clark. But you can't leave out Superman, also. My biggest problem. LOIS GETS IN TROUBLE ALL THE TIME!!!!, I counted one maybe two episodes where Lois wasn't kidnapped, shot at, or just in trouble. It got old real fast, just like smallville. At some point someone has to ask clark why he's always there to rescue everybody, here it's why don't you move away to a different city. Again, to me, John shea saved season one. His Lex Luthor was awsome, really the only bright spot for season one. I give it two stars only for John Shea, nothing else.

Later we would see Tom Welling channel his inner Dean Cain and basically try to play Clark the same way. It was done well enough to influence the animated series and even the Superman comics at that time!

The pilot was done so well it feels like you are watching a Superman reboot!

The first season is the best with a lot of subtle but intoxicating chemistry between Lois and Clark. Their characters are best described through their wedding oaths (4th season). Clark Kent is a man with ""gentle grace and quiet strength"", which Dean Cain is naturally gifted to portray. Teri Hatcher has successfully shown the evolution of Lois Lane, from a cutthroat career girl into a loving wife. The supporting characters are very good as well.  Luthur, Perry and Jimmy are all memorable.

Plot holes abound, but even so, it is pleasant to watch, and you quickly fall in love with the characters.

Life was never the same.  The wonderful, weird & funny relationship between Lois & Clark made the show.  Clark was calm, cool, Lois was wild and full of it.  The show was never played out fast and choppy; time was taken to flesh out the characters, and to provide the viewers with some fun.  Lois sings in a club, they got zonked with love potion and they have a honeymoon hideout.  It was fun to watch, the office set was really nice, and Lois & Clark always looked amazing.

I think Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are fantastic and have great chemistry, not to metion Teri Hatcher is absolute eye candy!  I know this show revolves around Lois and clark(hence the title) but i was expecting a little more Superman and a little more action(which i see really ramped up in season 2) but i got tired of seeing Superman wasting his powers on heating up cups of coffee, floating paper balls into wastebaskets and eating a plate of eggs at the speed of light....I hope seasons 3 and 4 come down in price soon so i can own all 4 seasons cause im never paying 40+ dollars",1298246400,,828,4.19496855345912

2255584,5,B00080ZG2O,"Season 1 is the benchmark for all other television premieres to follow. The pilot is like a movie. L&C just a breezy, fun show and I can't imagine anyone not liking it just a bit.

Dean Cain fits this role like a glove, portraying a kindhearted yuppie who isn't hokey. -- probably the hardest part of playing Superman. Teri Hatcher as Lois is pigheaded and brave in her own inimitable way, like Lucy from Peanuts all grown up. Lane Smith is the best Perry White of all time, period. Micheal Landis is a success as Jimmy Olsen; His nasally Bronx accent is, oddly enough, perfect for the role. A big blow to the series was executive meddling which replaced Landis with Justin Whalen, thus ruining the rapport with Perry. Smith and Whalen are Laurel & Hardy, whereas he and Landis have a genuine bond.

L&C also puts a neat spin on Clark's parents, particularly Eddie Jones as an unconventional Pa Kent. The deep-throated voice and rotund appearance sets Jones apart from what is traditionally a good ol' boy depiction. Lastly, John Shea provides Lex Luthor with a tone similar to Telly Savalas. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't always think of things for him to do, so Shea pops up in various episodes for no reason. There are whole scenes of Luthor pontificating to himself, to his butler, to his dog, to his reflection, none of which adds to the plot (though his speechifying is fairly amusing). Similarly, Tracy Scoggins' Cat Grant is an utterly useless character. Happily, they got rid of her season 2.",1277164800,,1507,4.726235741444867

2255587,5,B00080ZG2O,"It's hard for me to admit that I actually prefer this adaptation to the first two Christopher Reeve movies, since I think those two are still among the best superhero movies ever to hit the screen.  But the truth is, on the balance, I do like this series just a little bit better, despite the silliness and the camp that it often displayed.  It was an interesting new take on the Superman story.  It's very different in focus from the movies.  In them, Superman was the main character.  The first movie shows his arrival on earth, and some of his upbringing with Jonathan and Martha Kent, and it's made abundantly clear, from the beginning, that he has a great destiny ahead of him.  His early life is just shown as preparing him for it.  Then, in his late teens, he finds a green crystal which leads him to someplace in the arctic, where he raises the Fortress of Solitude, and finds recorded images of his father, prepared for this day, and he spends years ""training up"" to fulfill his destiny.  He even reappears dramatically, in costume as Superman for the first time to make this clear.  He's not really Clark anymore; he's Superman.  Clark is now just a disguise he wears to fit into human society, and allow him not to lose touch with his humanity.  Superman is the real person, and Clark is the disguise (which is why he doesn't mind frequently looking like a fool in his guise as Clark).  The upside of this is that it does make it at least SLIGHTLY more plausible that a pair of glasses would be enough of a disguise, given that A) most people probably don't think Superman even has an alter ego, and B) that he acts so differently, slouches, and alters his voice as well.  Superman and Clark act like two completely different characters.  The downside of this is that it means Lois is never going to go for a dweeb like Clark.  Her eye will remain fixed firmly on Superman.

Lois & Clark had a different take on things.  Superman is not the main identity, Clark is.  There is no Fortress of Solitude where he goes to be educated in his destiny by Jor-El's avatar.  He simply goes to college and studies to become a journalist.  Superman is not some role he was destined for; it's just a way he came up with on his own to try and use his great powers to help people, while still remaining able to lead a ""normal"" life and have normal relationships with his friends, family, coworkers, and the woman with whom he falls in love.  The downside of this is, that since he doesn't act all that differently as Clark and Superman, it is rather incredible that nobody ever sees through his disguise -- a fact at which they frequently poke fun in the series, with tongue firmly in cheek.  But the upside of this approach is that it does allow for Clark, as well as Superman, to be someone with whom Lois can believably fall in love.

And this is where the series excels.  The Lois & Clark relationship has never been written better.  It starts out with Lois being grudgingly saddled with a new partner whom she snidely dismisses as ""a hack from Nowheresville,"" even as she is totally swept off her feet (literally in the final scene of the pilot) by the Man of Steel.  She soon comes to value Clark as a friend and partner, however.  She's actually attracted to him early on, but being a basically asocial, career-oriented, type A personality, with a history of bad relationships with both her family and her past boyfriends, this is something she would sooner die than admit.  But then, gradually, she comes to face her true feelings for Clark, and even, in the end, realizes that she loves him more than Superman.  This is something they handled really superbly on this show.  It bears comparison with ""Smallville.""  On that show, Clark and Lana are romantically attracted to each other, but in order to maintain romantic tension over several seasons, the writers were obliged to keep them from really getting together permanently.  Unfortunately, this is hard to do believably over such a long time if the characters are supposed to be in love with each other, and they resorted to a bevy of plot devices that had the unfortunate side effect of taking a character who started out as a beautiful, sweet-natured, good-hearted, girl-next-door, whom it was easy to see why Clark fell in love with, and transforming her into a rather unsympathic character, who is by turns, whiny, unreasonable, passive-aggressive, manipulative, hypocritical, and other equally unattractive things, and it got to the point that you had to ask what Clark saw in her.  The writers of Lois & Clark never did this to Lois, and yet still managed to stretch the pursuit and courtship out over three years.  If anything, Lois got more likable and sympathetic over time, and it was easy to see why Clark was head over heels for her.  Of course, it helped tremendously that Teri Hatcher was the actress playing Lois.  She remains far and away the best actress in the role yet, and her Lois was gorgeous, sexy, vivacious, aggressive, feisty, and just plain adorable, especially when she's displaying the temper that caused Clark to refer to her (after they got engaged) as ""my little tornado.""

Dean Cain is good in the dual role of Clark and Superman.  He's not nearly the actor Christopher Reeve was, and his Superman is not remotely as good, but his onscreen chemistry with Teri Hatcher was perfect, and he's great as Clark.  Also superb was the entire supporting cast.  Lane Smith was absolutely brilliant as Perry White.  Michael Landes is also the best Jimmy Olsen ever, in my opinion, and the makers of this show made a huge mistake in replacing him (supposedly, they thought he looked too much like Dean Cain), though Justin Whalin did very well in the role from season two onward.  Tracy Scoggins was good, and it's a shame she didn't return.  And finally, Eddie Jones and K. Callan were perfect as Clark's parents.  I also like it that in Lois & Clark, Jonathan and Martha don't just raise Superman, only to die and clear the way for him to fulfill his destiny.  They remain an important part of his life, not only as the parents who gave him his values, but to whom he turns again and again whenever he faces difficult situations and difficult decisions.  And moreover, I like it that they remain simple, unassuming, ordinary folks.  It always kind of bothered me in ""Smallville"" how first Jonathan and then Martha got elected to the Kansas state senate, with Martha eventually becoming a U.S. senator and moving to Washington; it's always been a feature of the Superman story that his parents were just good, ordinary, salt-of-the-earth common folks (though perhaps ones with uncommon integrity and moral fiber), not influential politicians and power brokers, or great movers and shakers of society.

Some are inclined to dismiss this series because it's a Superman series rather light on Superman; the special effects are rather crude at times; and it can certainly get rather silly and campy.  But look past the flaws, and enjoy it for what it is.  It's meant to be basically a romantic comedy, and it's focus is squarely, as the title suggests, upon the relationship between Lois and Clark, and it's evolution from a friendly rivalry, and an ironic love triangle (with Clark as his own rival), into a romance.  It's a great take on the classic American hero, and well worth watching.",1257724800,,7369,4.664860681114551
2255588,5,B00080ZG2O,"Another ""Superman"" series after the serials with George Reeves and the enormously successful (discounting the horrendous ""Superman III"" & ""Superman IV""), did we REALLY NEED another ""Superman"" series? The answer is a resounding YES, YES, YES. Deborah Joy Levine has recreated Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's immortal comic book hero for a new generation. Gone is Lex Luthor, mad scientist with a bald head. Gone is Lois Lane, typical damsel-in-distress. Gone is Perry White, ""Great Caesar's Gohst."" But...never fear, die-hard ""Superman"" fans, all is not lost. Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and Perry White are only a few of the characters that have been updated in this family-friendly television series. As it was shot for ABC, the show was very family friendly, with only some suggestive dialogue, but that's as far is it got (at least for Season 1; I've yet to buy Seasons 2-4, as I wasn't allowed to see all the episodes of this wonderful series, but then again, I was only 7 years old). No graphic violence, no swearing and no sexual content. Today's shows, unfortunately, are very raunchy, and you can almost not find a wholesome family program (unless you have TVLand, where you'll constantly find reruns of ""I Love Lucy,"" ""Hogan's Heroes"" and the classic favourite ""The Andy Griffith Show."") Why is is that Disney's 1957-1959 television series ""Zorro"" isn't rerun anymore? Or The Three Stooges' shorts? Or ""Touched By An Angel""? Or ""New World Zorro""? Or this excellent show? All of these television shows were family-friendly. But I digress.

Thwe first season of this show is HIGH-FLYING FUN. I especially liked the banter between Lois, Clark and Cat. The bickering that went on was never risque. I also love ""Foundling."" Very well-written scene where Lois and Clark face off about his having lied to Lois. Every episode of the first season is excellent. I can't wait to get the rest of the seasons. The bonus features aren't as many as I thought, but everything is there: interviews with Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, John Shea, Tracy Scoggins, K Callan, Eddie Jones, Deborah Joy Levine, Robert Butler and a few of the behind-the scenes technicians. I also highly recommend the commentary on the pilot, as well as the series presentation andf introduction to the pilot by Ms. Levine. ""It's a bird, it's a plane. No, it's...SUPERMAN."" And The Man Of Steel IS BACK, AND FLYING HIGHER THAN EVER. (It would have been nice if Christopher Reeve, for me, the ideal and quintessential screen Superman, had made a guest appearance in the series. Not Rated.",1255305600,,2542,4.953161592505855

The quality of the screenwriting is refreshing, bold and mature, light-hearted, honest and romantic. From the start we know that this show has been made unashamedly and unapologetically to appeal to both women and men, whether straight or gay. First class adult-oriented, yet child-friendly entertainment.

The quality of the video is fantastic - with only a few scenes in the first two series showing the limitations of the editing equipment of the time. Just as you can see with each season how rapidly the Daily Planet's office computer systems have progressed, by season three the video quality is as good as anything we see today. Throughout the entire series the audio is, to my picky ears, impressively detailed and damned near flawless.

I love Dean Cain in this role - and also for his marvellous performance as the guilt-free gay bimbo Cole in ""The Broken Hearts Club"". Teri Hatcher also amazes me with the breadth of character that she brings to Lois - while creating a completely different style of person for her role in Desperate Housewives.

The extra features for each season are also a genuine treat and I greatly appreciate the work that's gone into them.

I also thought that the series has been cut short.  The way that Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher chemestry was on film through out the entire series was also phenomenal (I am not going to say anymore for those of you who haven't seen the series).

2255592,4,B00080ZG2O,"In this modern (read early 90's) take on the classic American Superhero, things are pretty much as we'd expect.  Clark Kent (Dean Cain) has moved to Metropolis and gotten a job at the Daily Planet.  He is teamed with investigative reporter Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) as they investigate stories for the newspaper under the demanding eye of editor Perry White (Lane Smith).  Rounding out the newspaper staff is eager young reporter/photographer Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes) and society (gossip) columnist Cat Grant (Tracy Scoggin).

But Clark Kent has a secret.  He's not a normal human but a man with extraordinary superpowers.  In order to keep that a secret, he takes on the identity of Superman, a fact that comes in handy since many of the stories he a Lois investigate seem to include lots of danger.  There's the sabotage of a space station.  A gang of thieves use invisibility suits to pull off their crimes.  A freak heat wave sends Superman behind bars when he is blamed.  An asteroid hurtling toward earth gives Superman (and Clark) amnesia.  A rival newspaper keeps scooping The Planet.  And the staff of The Planet becomes hostages in their own office.

Behind many of the problems is one man, Lex Luther (John Shea).  And while Lois has a crush on Superman (ignoring Clark in the bargain), Lex is pursuing her.  Will she discover how evil he is in time or will she fall in love with the villain?

I'm not too familiar with any of the incarnations of Superman, but that hardly matters here.  It builds its own mythology, while keeping many of the things familiar to fans of the comics.  And the emphasis here is on the romance.  In fact, it would be fair to say this is Superman as romantic comedy.  There are several pretty funny episodes in this set, but they are balanced by some of the more serious, episodes that managed to pull at my heart strings.

And yes, there is plenty of action.  Some of the special effects do seem dated today, but they hold up for the most part.

Everything is tied together well by the acting, including K Callan and Eddie Jones as Martha and Jonathan Kent.  And you can feel the chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher.

My only complaint with the season is the under use of Lex.  He is often shown and used.  But, unlike today's shows, nothing truly builds until the last couple of episodes.  Instead it feels like every episode they forget what came before so they don't build anything.

Still, that frustration is minor.  On the whole, this is a fun show.  It probably doesn't have the mythology completely right.  But it entertains in spades.",1215302400,,2595,4.660044150110375
2255593,5,B00080ZG2O,"Better late than never... I just recently discovered ""Lois and Clark"" thanks to some fellow Smallville fans. After tentatively buying season one, I rushed to get the rest of the series. My only complaint has been that there are only four seasons to buy.

I honestly don't know why I didn't watch this show when it was on the air... I remember thinking that Dean Cain was just not my idea of how Superman should look, but I got over that about 30 seconds into the pilot on DVD. Dean is delicious in tights and makes a great Superman! But he's even better as Clark Kent. I love the way he portrays Clark as a sweet, sensitive guy, who is also very competent and no pushover when it comes to dealing with Lois. You can tell why she eventually falls for him. And Terry Hatcher plays the best Lois I've ever seen. The chemistry between her and Dean is tangible and mesmerizing.

Sometimes the plots are silly and the special effects are primitive, but after awhile that just adds to the charm of the show. The characters were so well written and played, they didn't have to rely on fancy effects.

2255597,5,B00080ZG2O,"Very good series that focuses of the romance between Lois Lane and Clark Kent.  The writers used the tried and true technique of taking the viewer up to the point of Lois and Clark having a relationship and backing off.  After several of those ""false starts"", the two became an item and toward the end of the series actually married.  The weak point of the series was that this Superman was the dumbest of them all.  Here we have an alien with super powers and super intellect who seems to be confused and lost about events all to often.  In one episode, Lois is convicted of murder and sent to prison.  Clark, alias Superman, seems to be saying to her, ""I'll visit you on visitors day"".  That's the best the Man of Steel can do?  But the good guys prevail and Lois is finally proven innocent.  At least the writers realized she couldn't stay in the slammer.  duh...  But I still remain a fan of the series.  Dean Cain was very good as Clark Kent (he didn't write his part) and Teri Hatcher was a very good Lois Lane, along with being the prettiest of all the Lois Lanes to date.",1192579200,,1079,4.313432835820896

2255599,4,B00080ZG2O,"I have to admit something up front- I did not watch Lois and Clark when it was on - mainly because I am a sci-fi snob and had a really tough time with the incredibly cheesy special effects. Lois and Clark premiered the same year as the X-files, and the next year ER and Friends premiered. I never got into the show- I loved the SUperman movies with Christopher Reeve and had a tough time accepting Dean Cain as Clark Kent.

Fast forward- I have watched Smallville now for some time having got hooked on the DVDs and then watching first run epis last year when SUpernatural moved to Thursdays after it. I love the interaction between Tom Welling and Erica Durance as Lois and Clark.

I was told that much of the banter and styling for their relationship was lifted from LOIS and CLARK. Thus this review.

I find the show now to be utterly charming! Terry Hatcher as Lois is tough, savvy and still a little vulnerable- but only with Clark or her sister. Clark? He has a wonderful relationship with his parents- I love the L&C interpretation of Martha as a bit of a kooky overgrown hippy artsy type and Clark is definitely not the nerd of the past- more a little shy and not always certain of things , but with Lois he is witty and smart and other women see his brawn and good clean cut looks right away.

Tracy Scoggins as Kat is a hoot! Her overblown sexuality and constantly coming on to everything in pants reminds me some of Samantha on Sex and the CIty and adds some bonus levity when you don't expect it.

John Shea is growing on me as Lex- it is hard to see anyone else as Lex though after being treated to Michael Rosenbaum for 6 years.

I bought the remaining 3 seasons and look forward to more fun. One thing is certain- I know why Smallville was brought to TV- Warner Brothers was treated shabbily by ABC with limited budgets and resources for this show and they wanted to make sure that the story of Clark Kent was told without the cheese that is the one thing that really mars Lois and Clark. But this was ABC. Can you believe ER also a Warner production was shot starting the year after Lois and Clark premiered? The first season of ER has better effects than Lois and Clark which speaks volumes about the networks airing the repsective programming.",1180483200,,2261,4.371428571428571

2255605,4,B00080ZG2O,"Lois & Clark is an interesting re-telling of the Superman mythos.

Unlike the films, the original black and white series or Smallville, Lois & Clark strives to be a light-hearted, romance comedy. Also, instead of being ""about Superman,"" it's actually about the two title characters--this is a series about Lois & Clark, and their relationship; Superman usually just shows up near the end. I like this change in perspective. It's neat to really see the man behind the Man of Steel, for a change, and shows that ""Clark Kent is who he is, Superman is what he does.""

Concept aside, the execution is here and there. The acting runs the gamut. Cain and Hatcher are both great-looking people, and usually when people talk about this show, that's what they'll bring up. Their acting? Passable, but not brilliant, though I will say that Hatcher plays Lois Lane just about how I think she ought to be played. Cain's Clark Kent is a bit of a mold-breaker, because he's not the quiet, shy, nerdy Kent of Christopher Reeve--he plays Kent as a romantic, leading man. I still don't know quite what I think about that.

John Shea is a wonderful actor. That said, his Luthor doesn't quite stand out among a group of wonderful characterizations we've had over the last several years, including Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, and (the best thus far), Michael Rosenbaum. Shea's Luthor is okay, but it's wonderful how the series sets Luthor up as a romantic villain as much as anything else, as the third point in a triangle between our two heroes. Brilliant.

Disappointments in the casting include whatever the kid's name who plays Jimmy Olsen (though I've been told he gets replaced for the following seasons, and good riddance), and the horrible, horrible actress and character of Tracy Scoggins. She's neither a good actress nor attractive, her character adds nothing to the series, and I really have to wonder who she was, er, ""dating"" to land this gig.

Finally, it must be said that Lane Smith is just about perfect as Perry White. There's no better Perry White in any medium, and I can't imagine there would be; he owns this role, and the series is worth watching almost for him alone.

The episodes themselves are hit and miss, some being interesting and some being kind of boring. There is a slow plot progression in the background, as Clark learns about his Kryptonian background and Lex Luthor struggles harder and harder against his nemesis, Superman. It culminates in a wonderful two-part conclusion with a shocking finish.... I really wonder where they're going from there.

All in all, this isn't a perfect series, but it has enough strengths to be recommended (and particularly for fans of the Superman franchise). The primary fame of the series always seems to have been how hot Dean Cain is, or Teri Hatcher, or something like that. Fine, they're hot. But that's not why this show is fun to watch; it's fun, and interesting, for being a different sort of look at these iconic characters, featuring some standout characterizations and some nifty episodes.

2255607,5,B00080ZG2O,"I never enjoyed a television series as much as this.  Teri Hatcher is my idea of the REAL comic book Lois Lane and Dean Cain is such a wonderful Clark Kent alias Superman.  They have a great chemistry and most of the episodes are pure fun and often funny and so very, very well written and filmed.  I also liked the way Dean Cain would look at the audience with a certain look and make you feel part of the action.  This version has Clark's parents (Mom AND Dad)whom he actually consults with.  I recommend this for anyone who loves Superman, liked the old Superman series with George Reeves, and enjoys a good romantic comedy which includes a really super, super hero and a remarkably wonderful Clark Kent, and a beautiful, savvy, take-charge Lois Lane!!  And then, there's a really handsome but chilling Lex Luther who is able to mask his evil side from everyone except Clark/Superman AND the audience.  Lex is even more formidable because he gets away with so much, and Lois actually almost falls for him!! Perry White is AOK as are Jimmy Olsen, Cat, and Inspector Henderson.  I missed the series when it originally aired on television and have not seen the other seasons, but I have nothing but praise for Lois and Clark, Season I--the best Superman series ever!! Deborah Joy Levine has made this Superman adaptation even better than the original television series from the 50's starring George Reeves -- this should clue you in.  Cain has the looks, the body and the style of Superman and Teri Hatcher is believable as star investigative reporter Lois without being annoying, and Cain as Clark gently puts her in her place....put this together and you have romantic comedy at it's best!!",1155427200,3,1692,4.708474576271186

2255609,4,B00080ZG2O,"""Louis & Clark: the new adventures of Superman"" is a tv series first aired in 1993, that lasted 4 seasons. That might be a relatively short time, but it was enough to make me a fan. If you are another fan of the series, you will understand what I'm talking about, and why this dvd is a very good purchase. If not, I will try to explain it to you.

I will start by telling you about the plot. Of course, this series is about Superman/Clark Kent (played by a very handsome Dean Cain) and his struggle to save the world from Lex Luthor (John Shea), while falling in love with Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher). It is highly likely that you are already bored by this premise, specially considering that you have probably already watched some ""Superman"" movies, and maybe even ""Smallville"" (the new tv series featuring a teen Superman). However, I think that ""Louis & Clark: the new adventures of Superman"" is worth your time, due to the fact that it is:

a) different to the movies and ""Smallville"".

b) engaging and funny, it starts well with the first season, and gets even better later.

All in all, I think that you should give this tv series a try. However, bear in mind that this dvd includes merely the episodes of the first season. From my point of view, that is barely enough to show you what the series is about: you will want more :)

2255611,4,B00080ZG2O,"This show started when I was like 14 going on 15 and I never really got into it then. Even when TBS showed rerurns I never got that into it. I thought of it as just a lame soap opera that just focuses on the relationship of Lois and Clark. Now that I bought season 1 and 2, I see that it's much much more. When watching Smallvile, I used to think that it makes Lois and Clark look like [...] but it's really the other way around I realize now. I mean Smallvile, I realize now is what's really like a soap opera. When it has a chance to tell a great story, it just focuses on the Clark and Lana relationship when we've been taught a thousand times that they can never ever ever be together. So why keep showing us that ? We don't need any more proof. Now that it has a Clark, Lana and Lex love triangle it's even worse because it reminds me of the Dawson, Joey and Pacey love triangle in Dawson's Creek. So I now realize that Smallville is much more of a soap opera.

  Lois and Clark has villians of the week like Smallville but the creators are a lot more creative. I mean we've seen how many villians in Smallvile who got their powers from kryptonite. They've used krpytonite for everything possible in Smallville. Kryptonite bullets, kryptonite drugs that Lana was on recently ""rolls eyes lol"". They've used krptonite for so much that in season 6 I predict that someone will try to kill Clark with krpytonie toilot paper...lol. Anyway in Lois and Clark they have bad guys who are a lot more clever and out smart Superman without...krpytonite.

  The special effects maybe totally corny compared to Smallville's or even the original Superman movies but still if you can look passed that this show is a good time. It has a sense of humor and lets face it...Smallville needs more of a sense of humor sometimes. This show has a good cast too. I love the late great Lane Smith as Lois and Clark's boss Perry White who's obsessed with Elvis. He's possibly even my favorite Perry White. While John Shea (Mutant X) also steals the show as Lex Luther. I also liked Michael Landes (Final Destination 2) as Jimmy Olson in season 1 but he gets replaced by Justin Whalin (Dungeons and Dragons) in the following seasons. To me Landes was the better Olson, just my opinion lol.

  I'm now watching season 2 and to me the show really picks up then. Although this season is pretty good, esecially the finale where Lois almost makes the mistake of marrying Lex Luther despite everyone telling her it's a huge mistake. Also  Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher have chemestry and aren't always crying together and constantly talking about how they can't be together like...Clark and Lana in Smallville. Lets face it, that's about all we get from Clark and Lana.  With all the times Clark has saved Lana with  her knocked out so she can't see him use his powers. She would either be dead, in a coma or have a serious concussion lol. So thank you Smallville for making Lois and Clark look better and better.

John Shea is a delectably evil Lex Luthor, and remoulding Perry White into an Elvis freak is a stroke of genius. The Daily Planet sets cleverly reflect the influence of a 1930's comic and romantic sensibility that permeates the show. Dean Cain can't act (to put it mildly), although he certainly looks the part. It doesn't detract from the series too much because everyone else is so good, and the scripts are generally witty. Even so, Christopher Reeve's Superman (although not the film) seems more and more definitive.",1143849600,2,614,4.970873786407767
2255613,5,B00080ZG2O,"There have been three live-action Superman television series.  Firstly, the classic ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN series, which ran from 1952 to 1958; and lastly, the superhit look at Superman's youth, SMALLVILLE, which began in 2001.  In-between those two shows was LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN.  LOIS & CLARK does an interesting and clever thing (for which we can thank the creator, Deborah Joy LeVine): it takes what was originally a superhero vs. the bad guys story and turns it into a romantic comedy in the vein of MOONLIGHTING.  Some Superman fans liked it, others did not; regardless, the show developed a large fan base from its start in 1993 to its finish in 1997.

Here there is more focus on Clark Kent, the man, than on Superman.  Another interesting aspect of the show is that rather than Clark Kent being the mask and Superman being the true person, as portrayed in the SUPERMAN film series, Superman becomes the mask and Clark Kent is the true person.  That said, Dean Cain does an excellent job as the guardian of Metropolis, providing a very interesting and likable take on the Superman character.  Teri Hatcher is wonderfully crazy as Lois Lane, the dedicated reporter in love with Superman; the problem is that she's not in love with Clark ... or is she?  Throughout this first season the relationship between Clark/Superman and Lois is the focus.  Coming in as a side player is John Shea, giving a terrific performance as criminal mastermind/billionaire Lex Luthor, who also happens to be in love with Lois ... and despise Superman.  The supporting cast consists of Lane Smith, who is just fantastic as Daily Reporter editor Perry White (who in this show harbors a strong love of anything Elvis); Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen; Eddie Jones and K Callan as Clark's loving (and lovable) parents; and Tracy Scoggins as sexy playgirl Catherine ""Cat"" Grant.  This season's guest appearances include Dean Stockwell (in episode ""The Rival""), Larry Linville (""Neverending Battle""), and James Earl Jones (""The House of Luthor"").

Along with a fine cast and an interesting concept, LOIS & CLARK also includes some great and often funny writing; a perfectly magical score by Jay Gruska, which includes an absolutely magnificent theme song; and ... well ... some pretty cringe-worthy special effects (they've come along way since 1993).  Some of the season's finest episodes are the ""Pilot"", in which Clark Kent arrives in Metropolis; ""Neverending Battle"" (which features some very funny references to the 50's TV series); ""The Green, Green Glow of Home"", in which Clark discovers Kryptonite; ""The Man of Steel Bars"", where Superman promises not to use his powers after Metropolis' citizens suspect him of causing an immense heat wave; and the two-part season finale, ""Barbarians at the Planet"" and ""The House of Luthor"".  ""Foundling"" also features an interesting guest appearance from David Warner as Clark's biological father, Jor-El.

To some fans of the original superhero, LOIS & CLARK is not anything to rave about; but in my opinion, LOIS & CLARK is a grand little series sure to please those who give it a chance.  There's a charming simplicity to it, yet it's far from brainless.  LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN is high-flying fun.

2255614,4,B00080ZG2O,"Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, Lane Smith & John Shea.  In this 90's series the focus is not on Superman but on the relationship between Lois Lane (Hatcher) and Clark Kent (Cain).  While Cain's muscular frame may not need a padded super suit like the one worn by George Reeves his Superman still lacks the presence the hero should have (particularly if you compare him to Christopher Reeve) but his Clark Kent is such an enduring figure you don't care.  He doesn't play Kent as a geek but as simply a soft spoken planner very much in contrast to Hatcher's risk taking Lois.  Hatcher's Lois is such an exciting personality it is no wonder the Man of Steel's heart melted for her.  But what is most appealing here is the on screen chemistry between Cain and Hatcher.  This is what carries the show even in some of its weaker episodes.  This first season as in so many cases is its best with John Shea's new exciting version of Lex Luther as a major player.  After Shea left the series as a regular at the end of the first season no other villain matched up to him.  And  his return appearances over the next three years were always most welcome.  Most of the other supporting characters were also well played.  Lane Smith ranks as my favorite live action Perry White.  Eddie Jones and K Callen were also wonderful as Pa and Ma Kent.  Ms. Kallen's Ma Kent was also a new twist on the role.  Only Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen failed to impressed. To many he appeared to look too much like Cain to have much of an impact in the role. Sexy Tracy Scoggins was underused as Cat Grant - a total rewrite of a character who was a recent addition to the comic books.  Highlights of the first season include the ""Pilot"" which tells how Clark Kent got his job at the Daily Planet and how he and Lois first met.  ""The Green, Green Glow of Home"" which tells of Superman's first encounter with Kryptonite.  ""All Shook Up"" involves the possible destruction of the city of Metropolis from an on rushing meteor.  This episode is an uncredited remake of the ""Panic in the Sky"" an episode of the 50's George Reeves series.  In the final episode of the season Phyliss Coates (television's first Lois Lane)appears (following a tradition started by Noel Neill) as Lois Lane's mother.

2255619,5,B00080ZG2O,"I am Mexican and I got to see this show on the Warner Channel here at home. I'm a Superman fan since the comic ""The Death of Superman"" came out here in Mexico. Since then anything to do with Superman caught my attention.
This new perspective on the Superman caracter makes him more human and therefore suceptible to the only woman who has ever caught his attention, Lois Lane. Every Superman fan knows she's his true love, all the movies take in on that and also in the comic book there's ""The Wedding of Superman""
I'm a romantic at heart and this series is great because you get to see real human feelings in Superman and his inner conflicts regarding Lois and his career as super hero.
It is a great thing that fans of the series can now get it on DVD, even if it's thanks to Teri Hatcher's soaring career.

2255621,5,B00080ZG2O,"There are many great things about TV series coming out on DVD.  First, no commercials.  This has the obvious benefit of keeping unwanted ads from interrupting the narrative, though a secondary benefit is that it has been devastating to older television studies theories concerning television that emphasized the way that shows were integrated into network scheduling, an approach that made commercials integral to the experience of the show and made the show's themselves subservient to its role in the evening's programming as a whole.  Now we can finally appreciate shows entirely on their own.  Second, we get the opportunity to go back and catch up on some shows that for whatever reason we missed the first time around.

THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK was a show that I knew many people liked and enjoyed, but while I enjoyed the several episodes that I saw, I did not watch all that much of it at the time.  The great news is that the show is marvelous to watch for the first time twelve years down the road.  The show seems hardly to have aged, thanks in part to the timelessness of the design of the show.  The Superman legend has been used over and over since the earliest days of television.  There was the famous George Reeves version of the show in the early 1950s, a 1980s version of Superboy, this 1990s romantic version, and the currently running SMALLVILLE, which reconceptualizes the Superboy story.  On top of this there are multiple cartoon versions in both film and TV and several films.

Although THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK is respectful of previous versions of the Superman legend, its true predecessor is MOONLIGHTING, with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher filling the slots that Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd filled on that show.  The title is not merely a take off on Lewis and Clark, but a statement of purpose in emphasizing Lois as much as Clark in the story.  This truly is about Lois AND Clark, specifically their relationship with one another.  The story of the Man of Steel actually takes a back seat to the romantic comedy in the foreground of the series.  The show works in large part because of the great chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher as well as the overall production that keeps their relationship interesting.

Although I very much enjoy this series (at least through Season One), I have to note that the romantic relationship prospers at the sake of all else.  There is virtually no dramatic tension in any episode.  There are tremendous potential tensions in Clark's situation as a super empowered individual on the one hand and his need to keep this a secret so as not to endanger others on the other hand.  If one compares THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK to SMALLVILLE, this is all made pretty obvious.  On the latter, Clark's stringent efforts to keep his abilities secret comes close at times to destroying all his relationships.  Over and over his relationships come close to ruin because each of his friends knows that he is dishonest with them.  Precisely what he is hiding from them or lying about they are uncertain, but they all know that he has kept a great deal from them.  When Clark at the beginning of Season Five tells Lana that he wants a relationship with her he begins by telling her that there will be ""No more lies.""  Over five seasons Clark and Lex Luthor's friendship has been severely damaged by the lack of trust and truth telling between the two of them, each of them guilty of lying to the other.  There simply are no similar tensions in LOIS AND CLARK.  In fact, the earlier show is remarkably tension free.  In a way this is not surprising.  If LOIS AND CLARK's main predecessor is MOONLIGHTING, SMALLVILLE's predecessor is the profoundly dramatic BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER

Nonetheless, LOIS AND CLARK succeeds well as a romantic comedy.  It is filled with a host of in jokes and gags, most of which work.  My favorite might be at the start of the season, where Clark asks his mother to create a costume for him so that he can fight wrongdoing while keeping his identity secret.  She wonders if he should wear a mask to cover his face, but he explains that all he need do is remove his glasses, and demonstrates by removing them.  As his parents look at him, he apparently becomes unrecognizable to him each time he removes his glasses.  Of course, the ludicrousness of no one being able to recognize Clark as Superman has always been at the heart of the Superman story, but never has anyone made such a nice joke about it.  (On a side note, this is the major problem for SMALLVILLE in any attempt to have Clark create his Superman persona, since even Lois Lane knows him without his glasses.)

I should note one other problem with the show, though it is mainly a problem that SMALLVILLE has created for it.  By far the finest thing in that show has been the reconceptualization of Lex Luthor, making him a vastly more interesting and compelling figure than in any other version in the history of the franchise.  LOIS AND CLARK's Lex, on the other hand, is rather cartoonish and uninteresting.  He has been conceived as a sinister industrial magnate, but he is not really allowed to become more than a two-dimensional character.  The rest of the cast is at least OK, though the great stand out is the late Lane Smith, who succumbed this past summer to ALS.

On a minor note, fans of movies like THE MUSIC MAN or TV shows like THE GILMORE GIRLS will notice that the show is filmed on one of the most heavily used sets on the Warner Brothers lot.  Any fan of THE GILMORE GIRLS will over time start to recognize bits of the streets of Metropolis as parts of what is now Stars Hollow.  I first caught this on the episode where Clark takes Lois back to Smallville.  I recognized the set and then thought, ""If the camera will just move a bit we could see the gazebo on the town square.""  The camera moved and the gazebo was right where it was supposed to be.  The stock footage for the skyline of Metropolis, however, is clearly that of Chicago.  Interestingly, only night shots are used for Clark's flying scenes over the city.",1135123200,5,6110,4.6044362292051755
2255622,3,B00080ZG2O,"After 4 movies throughout the 1970's and 1980's, Superman seemed to have vanished from the realm of TV or movies.  So fans were thrilled when it was announced that Warner Brothers was making an hour long weekly drama series based on the 'Man of Steel'.  With this new series Warner Brothers was also quick to point out that this was going to be a slightly different take on the iconic hero, true there would be the classic costume, and plenty of special effects and action sequences, but the main drive of the show would be the relationship between Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent and his future love, Lois Lane.  This made some fans nervous, because they wondered will it stay true to the comic roots or just go off on its own, the answer was, a little of both.  But when the series premiered to huge ratings it looked as if Superman was back and better than ever and ABC had a winner on their hands, with ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"".

However, as good as the first episode was the show quickly spun out of control in terms of serious drama with some comedy, and became more of a comedy hour that focused less on Clark Kent and Superman (Dean Cain), and more on their lovely co-star Lois Lane as brought to life by actress Teri Hatcher.  Story lines were more humorous than they should have been, and the villains were never that threatening, and even Lex Luthor wasn't as intimidating as he should have been.

The aspect of the show that was always strongest was the acting, all of the cast members were very good in their respective roles, especially Teri Hatcher as a more modern Lois Lane, and Dean Cain as Superman, his take on Clark Kent was too macho for the role.  The problem with Dean Cain is that he played Clark almost identical to Superman, so there really was no differentiating the two characters other than by use of powers and clothes.  Also, a choice made by the producers of this show that served as a semi-slap in the face to fans of Superman, was the fact that they made Clark Kent's hair have the classic 'S'-curl, and Superman's hair was always slicked back, when in the comics it's always been the other way around.  This wouldn't have bothered me so much, except it was intentional, showing the lack of respect the production team had for the source material, in my opinion at least.

Truthfully, I liked the first episode and a few others here and there, but by the end of the first season I would catch a few episodes at a time, but was never a devout viewer, and based on what I've heard from other people I wasn't missing much.  Sadly, this show that had so much promise, failed on so many levels.  If you're a fan of Superman and would like some good television based on the character you may want to look at the season box sets of ""Smallville"" (seasons 1-4 are available on DVD) or the first season of ""Superman: The Animated Series"" (from the creators of ""Batman: The Animated Series""), both shows are terrific.

If you're still interested in ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"", in todays television rating system, this show would receive at most a TV-PG, so it is safe for the whole family to watch.  And as I said, there were several good episodes, and who knows you may just love it after all and think I'm completely off-base, and that's possible, though I doubt it will happen with this show.",1131926400,8,3362,4.488524590163935

2255626,5,B00080ZG2O,"This was a show that ended too soon, yet still left an everlasting mark on the Superman mythos. And Season 1 is JUST the start.

This is definately a Byrne era Superman, vs the Curt Swan era Superman that we've got in Smallville. You have a Superman with problems. You have a Superman that is Clark Kent and Superman is just the suit that he wears. Not the other way around where Clark is the disguise.

If you watch Season 1 and then follow it up with checking out the original ""Man of Steel"" comics mini-series from 1986 you will see A LOT of it brought to life on the small screen, with changes of course. But Lois looks ALOT like the early Byrne Era Lois, and Clark looks sort of like how Byrne did Superman (whereas Superman looks more like Byrne's Clark with the slicked back hair)

From a comics fan perspective, this is a fun series to watch that while it nods to continuity, it still has its own that doesn't really make you feel like you need to know the comics to enjoy the show.

And just from a TV aspect, it's a great comedy/action/drama. If you like Desperate Housewives and Smallville,  you'll be hooked. There are plot threads that while they mean nothing when you watch them, they creep up, or pop up in later seasons. (Like the Romance Novel that Lois is told to be writing early on in Season 1 pops up in Season 3)

Teri Hatcher is like this generation's Lucy Ball. She's a great physical comedy actress. Her facial expressions and the fact that she can take a hit or prat fall without it appearing forced or done solely for comedic purposes. You gotta love her, she can feel dumped on, but then she'll put her head on Clark's shoulder and mutter something about ""Oh Superman will never notice me' and sigh pitifully. All the while you've got ol' Clark thinking, ""Uhm you're resting your head on his shoulder... wake up girl""

I can't wait until WB releases season 2. It feels like its been forever since this came out, but I hope it comes out soon. Be a nice Christmas present for the Superman fan in your life. Or someone who's been getting into Smallville or hearing about the impending ""Superman"" movie coming out next year.

Maybe its because I found it exciting one moment and annoying right after.  The effects were decent during its time, but one thing that I found weird was the flying sequence.  Dean Cain usually had his arms in a kind of fighting stance, bent at the elbows and his fists close to his chest.  This is not how Superman was portrayed in either the movies or comic books.  At least Smallville got it right when Clark flew for that brief moment at the season premiere of their 4th season.  And another thing, is it really that hard to distinguish the Superman persona from the Kent identity?  If Lois Lane was really such a keen, top-notch reporter, how could she not see the resemblance between the the two identities?  And she worked with him on a daily basis!  Heck, Clark didn't evern try to differentiate his voice in any way. I have watched half of the episodes, and it hasn't excited me enough to want to finish watching the whole season right away, unlike the Smallville installments.  But I do admit Cain and Teri Hatcher were a perfect match to play their respective identities, and the chemistry and banter between them is fun to watch.",1126915200,5,1270,4.530701754385965

2255634,4,B00080ZG2O,"""Lois and Clark"" finally made its debut amidst the mass of other Television series box sets. For those of you who enjoyed the show when it first aired, this DVD set is a blessing. For all those who missed the show the first time around or watched and perhaps didn't like it, this box set is still a blessing; only you're going to have to give it a second chance.

I don't remember much of the show when it was first out. I wasn't a fan of superman, and I was all of 16, so an emotional drama about the struggle of an alien superhero in a world of humans was the last thing on my mind.

I've grown up since then and Superman has grown on me. So much that I'm willing to sit through season after season of the dull and reiterated ""kryptonite bad guys"" of Smallville, simply because it's about the Man of Steel. But that makes me sound like a fan boy, and perhaps I am, but this review isn't going to be a lyrical banter of why Kal-el is the greatest of all. Because... even if Lois and Clark had absolutely nothing to do with Superman, it would still be worth that $60 you spend on it.

While I wish I could say Dean Cain is a phenomenal actor, I can't. Dean Cain is charismatic; I'll be the first one to admit it. Some things are a bit out of his range though, as I can't really see him playing someone comical, however, I can and do see him as ""Superman"". His presence is striking to say the least. He's built, he's tall and he has every facial aspect-the strong jaw, the sharp eyes and the wavy hair-we've come to recognize from Superman. But that only goes so far, if you want to slap the guy on a poster and be done with it, looks will work. But for Dean Cain to actually pull off being Superman he has to act like him as well. I've always pictured Superman with a quiet confidence, the stern glare while his arms crossed over his chest. The sort of fellow that lets his presence speaks for itself. Dean Cain pulls that aspect off with a glittering perfection. He's stern but not abrasive when he speaks, and no matter what he's dealing with Cain carries a certain amount of compassion in his voice, much like I can imagine superman having. He's bold without being over-bearing, confident without being egotistical. Even the movements Superman has when he's flying, or revealing the S underneath his shirt is demonstrated in a stunning quality. Dean Cain does a very good job of being Superman.

However, Dean doesn't do an outstanding job at being Clark Kent. Perhaps I'm still stuck on the majesty that Christopher Reeves created and I'm being too picky, but Clark Kent is a dork. He's clumsy, he's unsure and he strikes me as almost wormy. Dean Cain is just too confident all the time. He comes across-to me at least-as Superman with glasses when he's playing Kent. He tones down the boldness only slightly in his role reversal and comes across as a bit egotistical. But it's only a minor set back and doesn't make the show horrible by any means.

Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane. This girl has got everything right so I won't drone on too much about her role. Needless to say it's stellar. She personifies everything that Lois Lane is: Egotistical, untrusting, pushy, melodramatic but with an underlying compassion; a sort of innocent nature amidst her otherwise leather emotions and it shows in her obsession with Superman.

The other characters do just as well and you won't have to ""deal"" with the fact that Lex Luthor has hair or that Jimmy Olsen isn't a photographer yet. To be honest, you won't even notice. Each person plays their role to perfection, despite the tiny changes made.

Let's not forget that even though this show is about Superman and he has a lot of comic book appeal to him, it is a drama. It's-at times-sappy, eye soaking, and gushy but it still remains in the realm of heroic and inspiring. Every aspect is balanced incredibly well. Some episodes are strictly about Superman and his desire to fit in with the human race while some are about the incredible, impending relationship he shares with Lois. I never got bored because there was too much flying or too many heart fluttering moments. Granted, a lot of it has already developed. Superman is Superman, to put it bluntly. The first episode goes over his costume; one has his first involvement with Kryptonite and many have him building his feud with Lex. This is a story about Kal-El being Superman, not becoming Superman.

The evolution and development of the story lies not in Superman, but between Clark Kent and Lois. This show is an absolute 100% teaser. I found myself watching episode after episode just because I'm campy and I like those brief, smile forcing heartfelt moments between the two. There are plenty, so don't worry that you're going to be fated to endure four years of hopping around before something finally happens. *Coughs.* Smallville. True, they don't ""end up"" together... at least not yet, but it isn't so dragged out it seems like they're running out of ideas and trying to scrape one more year by you either. Everybody knows they end up together. The enjoyment of each episode isn't in wondering if they are going to fall in love, but instead watching it happen. Seeing someone fall deeply in love is almost as fun as doing it yourself. There is a balance in their relationship as well. Clark is everything Lois is not and vice-versa, but they get along surprisingly well and they have their own childish antics, which makes the show humorous at times. It's just easy to watch them together; plain and simple.

Maybe I'm bias because I enjoy them both-Superman and lighthearted, romantic dramas. It's a demographic though and if you don't fit in to it, chances are you won't like this show. But fans of The Man of Steel will find the show having enough of a superhero aspect to keep watching, and the drama fans will find plenty of what entices them as well. I wasn't a fan of the show the first time around, and oddly enough I find myself anticipating the second season. This show is more then worth giving it a second chance, maybe even a first.",1125100800,8,6055,4.522374429223745
2255635,5,B00080ZG2O,"Season one is a great start to this take on the Superman story.  Dean Cain is every bit the part of both Superman and Clark Kent.

2255636,5,B00080ZG2O,"Corny? Yes. Slightly sappy? Yes. Iffy acting from a few characters? Yes. Still worth watching? Yup.

We need heroes; even made-up ones. Unlike previous generations, however, we're less likely to expect or believe that our heroes are perfect, infallible god-like creatures. Good, bad, or otherwise (your opinion may vary), we're much more cynical/realistic in our expectations of our heroes, real-life or fictional.

Lois & Clark turns this slightly more realistic and less worshipful eye towards the icon of Superman. In focusing heavily on his day-to-day interactions as Clark Kent, and on his many internal conflicts regarding the meeting of his two identities, we are able to understand Superman as a heroic human being, rather than simply a hero.

In this sense, of course, the series may be too ""soap-opera-ish"" for some. Office interactions and internal conflicts are not, necessarily, as fun to watch as explosions and flapping capes and men in blue flying over breathtaking skylines... although they squeeze enough of those into the episodes, I suppose, at least for my tastes. Superman/Clark Kent is a man who has unrequited crushes, bumbles around a decent amount, has to convince himself NOT to use his X-ray vision to see Lois changing when they share a hotel room on a stakeout, and is decidedly uncomfortable speaking into a microphone at a charity engagement.

He is also, of course, 100% the hero. Lex Luthor, conversely, is 100% the ""bad guy,"" although like Kent, his character complex beyond goodguy-badguy definitions. In season one, at least, he is not without redemption, or at least the possibility for redemption. He falls, hard, for Lois Lane, and while his actions to make her his own are not acceptable by any standards, his capacity of love, pretty much truly and honestly, humanizes him considerably. We'll leave what happens to his character in future seasons for after the are realeased.

Lois Lane's character is perhaps the most interesting of the three. The traditional trio: hero, villian, damsel-in-distress, is still the basis for the show. And Lois certainly DOES find herself in a lot of life-threatening jams. Her character's vulnerability, however, is combined with a toughness that makes her constant need for life-saving a little more palatable.

These characters, as well as the minor characters (Jimmy, Perry, Cat, and various incidentals) make the show well worth watching despite its apparent and obvious hokey-ness. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll enjoy it.",1124755200,3,2512,5.236318407960199

Here you laugh with him, not at him... he's witty, sexy, loyal and confident, with a delightful mischievious streak and a bit of a temper... proving that mild-mannered people don't have to be doormats!  In order to use his powers to help people, Clark invents a superhero alter-ego, whom Lois promptly dubs Superman; but he soon discovers that living a duel life has its complications.  Lois is obviously smitten with the man in the cape, who she thinks is perfect... and the more Clark succeeds in making him so, the less Lois notices her new partner.  You can't help but feel for the guy!

I was surprised at how well the series has worn.  Even the special effects still look good (although not up to the standard of Smallville, of course).  The sets haven't dated, the scripts are still fresh and I'd still kill for most of Lois' wardrobe!  In fact the only things that look out of place are the green-screen computers and over-sized cell phones, which I think we can forgive... don't you?  I can't wait for seasons 2, 3 & 4 to be released!",1123459200,5,1348,4.487704918032787
2255643,5,B00080ZG2O,Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman was awesome! I can't wait for the next season to come out! Dean Cain is so Hot!,1123286400,2,126,4.08
2255644,5,B00080ZG2O,"When I bought the dvd, I thought I'd only still like it bc I loved it when I was a teenager.  But I so love watching it now bc Lois and Clark was an amazing show!  And I'm so bummed that they've only released the first dvd set bc I can't wait to buy all of them.  Pls release seasons 2-4!  Please!  All of my friends are waiting for these too!  This show has everything Smallville is missing.  If I were one of the writers for Smallville, I'd be ashamed that Smallville doesn't even compare to everything Lois and Clark embodies: witty comedy, a romance bw Lois and Clark that makes you giggle and have butterflies, original and well-thought of plots and so much more...oh, and yeah, an actor that can actually act!  Dean Cain is amazing (and hot!); the way he portrays Clark makes you melt bc Clark is so smooth but super cute at the same time.  Tom Welling's hot too but c'mon, the guy can't act.  All he does is look from the left to the right at the end of each scene!!  hahaha, it's funny, but it's true.  Anyone can notice that.  And the plots for Smallville are so inconsequential, nothing much ever happens, and Lana's blah.  Buy Lois and Clark, it doesn't matter that it's a 90s show.  I love Desperate Housewives, but Lois and Clark is funner to watch, and Teri is even more captivating.  And did I mention that Dean Cain is drop-dead gorgeous?",1123113600,4,1354,4.334661354581673
2255645,5,B00080ZG2O,Lois & Clark is a great DVD for the whole family to watch. We can't wait until the Complete Second Season is out as well.,1123027200,3,121,3.88
2255646,5,B00080ZG2O,"This was one blast from the past that entirely lived up to expectation.  I've been waiting for L&C to come out on dvd for what seems like forever, and when it arrived I wasn't disappointed.

The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher still sizzles, and ten years after I first fell in love, Cain seems as attractive as ever, something you can't always count on when you look back at childhood crushes.  Frivolity out of the way, on to more serious considerations.

I know some Superman fans were disappointed with the focus on romance in L&C, but I count myself as a pretty serious Superman fan too, and the wit and charm of this series leaves others in the dust.  The second season, which had more man in cape heroics, was considerably weaker.  These days I enjoy Smallville too, but the writing of this show is vastly superior.

The packaging is beautiful, and the extras are good, though not the best of any dvd set I own.  The ""making of"" is fun though, and has input from Deborah Joy Levine, the creator, and both Dean and Teri as well as John Shea (Lex Luthor) which was nice.  The commentary on the pilot is also good - DJL sounds amazingly good-natured when speaking about ""creative differences"" (she left at the end of S1), and Dean Cain sounds like he had a ball filming and still looks back on the show very fondly.

I'd watched every episode and all the extras within a week of it arriving on my doorstep, and can't wait for the rest to be released, which I think is a pretty good sign!  I heartily recommend this dvd to old fans and new alike.",1122508800,5,1562,4.407665505226481
2255647,5,B00080ZG2O,"I love this collection.  It is exactly how I remember watching the series and I enjoy watching them in order.  I like the ""Play all Episodes"" feature on each disk.

2255648,5,B00080ZG2O,"I guess you had to have grown up with George Reeves' original ""Adventures of Superman"" television show to truly appreciate and love ""Lois and Clark.""  I know the latter series was criticized by some alleged die-hard comic book fans as a spoiling of the legend but, dang it, as a George Reeves Boomer I found myself glued to the TV set every Sunday night.  You see, Superman is one of the only characters from pop culture who has meant something for every generation since his debut in the late 1930s.  L&C took the ball and ran with it.

We Boomers grew up with the 1950s series and can pretty much recall every single episode.  We secretly wished the show had grown beyond the dated cheesiness of its later years.  We also loved the Christopher Reeve movies but you can only do so much with characterization in the course of a two hour film.

As proven again with the current ""Smallville"" show, Superman is a superhero who is best portrayed in the environs of a weekly television series.  More than any other comic book character, Superman's supporting cast is so strong that we need to see them play out their roles and grow over the course of a few years.  L&C gave us the chance to finally see these people that we love portrayed in a fresh way.

Comic book writer-artist John Byrne once said that the story of Superman is not the story of larger-than-life heroics.  Rather, the character truly shines in his struggles to live out his extraordinariness in the ordinary routine of daily life.  Nothing pleased me more than to finally see Clark find happiness with the woman that he loved.  I give thanks to the creators of ""Lois & Clark"" for portraying these beloved characters in a way that updated them for the 1990s generation but at the same time made it meaningful for us 1950s folks.  It was truly a multigenerational show.",1122422400,2,1832,4.579754601226994
2255649,5,B00080ZG2O,"I watched every episode of this show as they came out so long ago.  And I was so excited to finally see the first season on DVD.  Since then I have probably watched every disc at least two or three times.

The show is something funny, entertaining, and at times cheesy.  Its quality entertainment that you can feel good about letting your kids watch, unlike some of the trash on TV these days. I'm just waiting impatiently until the rest of the four seasons come out.  I'm looking forward to reminiscing in the continuing story of Lois and Clark.

In response to some other people's reviews, its a show, its about a man who flies, and it doesn't have to represent reality as it is.  If that were the case, then the show wouldn't have been on in the first place.  Also, the average person has literally no clue how things in space work and doesn't notice bullets that don't make dents.  And those that do, really don't care.  Like me, I'm a physicist, I use this as material when I teach because its unreal and I have my students figure out why.  It just something fun, nothing to get fussy over.",1122422400,2,1095,4.371287128712871
2255650,5,B00080ZG2O,"you just gotta love this show! definitely one of my favorite... however, there are four consistent bugs throughout this season(or possibly the whole series)

first, people are not supposed to hear anything superman says in space as there is no air out there as the medium of transmitting sound;

second, also 'cause there is no air in outer space, superman's cape is not supposed to be flowing like it is when he is flying out there;

third, bullets that hit superman will bounce back 'cause he's invulnerable. his outfit, however, is not. but whenever any bullet hits him, you can see absolutely no damage whatsoever at all done to his clothes. actually you can see how useless the bullets are in the episode ""i'm looking through you"", in which numerous bullets hit the police cars outside the gold repository, but none of them even dent a little bit.

fourth, if clark always wears his superman outfit inside his suit, where does he keep his cape, which always mysteriously appears when he changes in a flurry of light? in fact in the episode ""all shook up"" you can see that when he regains his memory, unbuttons his shirt to reveal the outfit, the cape isn't there and he takes off without it. of course in the next shot, he is already wearing it as usual.

and there are a few other bugs in some individual episodes:

in the episode ""the green, green glow of home"", the hypersonic watch is activated twice, but the sounds it produces in these two times are distinctively different;

in the episode ""the man of steel bars"", just after superman pretends to have got out of the shower to talk to lois, in one shot his hair is put in place by the water from the teapot, but in the next when he says he has to stop the runaway train, you can clearly see that his hair is already ""glued"" down by mousse or something to that effect;

in the episode of ""pheromone, lovely"" the 1% solution of miranda's perfume is supposed to work for 48 hours, but obviously everyone who gets sprayed with returns back to normal just a little after 24 hours. also when lois gets miranda's note perry is about to hold a staff meeting, but after jimmy talks to april and gets her forgiveness, everyone just goes back to work with no mention of the meeting at all.

in the episode ""i've got a crush on you"", when superman confronts the toasters, he freezes them. but that fit of cool air obviously doesn't come from supman, as he is standing right in front of the gang and you can see very clearly the air comes from somewhere from the left;

in the episode ""witness"", judging from the heavy coats people are wearing, it should be in late autumn or early winter. when lois gets up in the morning, her clock shows 6 a.m, yet it's already broad day time outside. but at 6 a.m in late autumn or early winter, it should be still pretty dark outside(at least for a city located in such latitude as metropolis). obviously that scene is shot much later in the day.",1122076800,,2933,4.465420560747663
2255651,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois & Clark is simply an awesome show, and this DVD set of Season One is very good.  The special features it offers, though not many, are interesting and give you a view into the making of the show and the actors behind the characters.  Lois & Clark is a show for the old and young alike.  It would make a great addition to any collection.",1121731200,4,340,4.121212121212121
2255652,5,B00080ZG2O,I remember seeing Season 1 so many years ago. Seeing it again brings back so many memories. This series is really exceptional I am pleading with WB to release Season 2 as soon as possible.,1121644800,4,188,4.4
2255653,5,B00080ZG2O,"I've been in love with the Superman character and mythos since I was a little girl in the 70s and the movies first came out.  Even back then watching the movies I rememeber wishing there was more romance-- more interaction between Lois and the man of steel.  When I heard that this series was more about the Lois and Clark releationship, I was a little skeptical.  However after buying the DVD and watching the entire first season in one weekend, I am sold on the idea.
I never got a chance to see the series when it first aired but as I was watching all I could think was --WOW!  I LOVE THIS!  The slow build in the Lois and Clark's relationship from friendship to something more than friendship is truely delightful and the unresolved sexual tension between the two main characters kept me saying 'I'll just watch one more episode' on into the wee hours of the night.
I love the fact that both Lois and Clark hide who they really are.  Clark, of course, has to hide his Superman persona but Lois is also hiding her need to be loved and accepted behind her tough-girl reporter image.  The few times she lets Clark inside her carefully guarded walls are just delicious and very well done.  I think my favorite part of season 1 is the scene in Witness right after an attempt on Lois's life.  Clark (as himself, not Superman) rushes in to save her.  When he finds out she's all right, he wants to go catch the bad guy.  But Lois begs him, 'No, please don't leave me.'  He replies, ""No, I won't.  I'm here-- I'm right here.""  Then he wraps her close in his arms and holds her, stroking her hair and back.
Not to sound like a fangrrrl but this is the kind of thing I wanted more of in the movies as a kid and Lois and Clark has it in spades.  As far as I'm concerned,seasons 2-4 just can't come out fast enough.  In fact, if anybody has them on tape I will pay.  Mail me at[...]Thanks, vangiekitty",1121644800,7,1893,4.2873239436619714
2255654,5,B00080ZG2O,"Well, they finally got their act together and put out a DVD set of the first season...but now I crave MORE of Dean Cain in those fabulous tights! Not many men can pull those off! What is great about this collection is not just the that all the episodes are included but the bonus features are interviews with the cast now...ie. Teri Hatcher on the Desperate Housewives set. They talk about casting decisions, how Dean Cain was almost deemed to young for the part! Blasphemy! They also talk about the visual effects, which now seem a little hokey, but at the time were wonderous, especially for a tv show. How they wanted to add more real ""womaness"" to Lois' character...so much extra info that enriches the viewing experience. A must have for any man who wanted to be the man of steel as a kid, and any woman who, despite wanting to deny it, would love to be swept off her feet!
In my humble opinion, as always...",1121385600,4,913,4.440476190476191
2255655,4,B00080ZG2O,"I haven't noticed any comments from anywhere online, but the pilot episode on the DVD does include footage that wasn't in the original  ABC airing back in 1993.  It's been so long ago that not even the commentary by the producers and Cain seem to realize it.  Someone even makes comment during opening credits that he didn't rememeber it looking that way when it first aired.

Teri Hatcher's intro scene on it's original network airing was not with the bearded disguise.  A lot of scenes did look unfamiliar so had to geek out and find a friend with an original VCR (old school) taping from the series premiere and sure enough, many of the scenes in the DVD appear to be previously unaired.

If you were a fan of the show back in the 90's and haven't picked up the DVD set, now you have another incentive to go out and purchase it.  But to my knowledge, it is only the pilot that has added scenes.  The other episodes appear to be the way they originally aired.",1121126400,4,961,4.389830508474576
2255656,5,B00080ZG2O,"At a recent chat, a WB representative said to expect more ""Lois & Clark"" in 2006. Let's hope it's sooner in the year rather than later, because after watching Season 1, I cannot wait for more!

Season 1 has always been my least favorite of the seasons (Season 3 being the best), but the entire show was still excellent. This season was so much fun to watch! Highlights include the 2-part season ender, where Lois rejects Clark and Superman rejects Lois, and ""Honeymoon in Metropolis,"" which is pure fun (""There's no such word as 'chumpy'""). But they're all worth watching over and over again.

The casting couldn't have been better. Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain had awesome chemistry that kept us wanting more; Lane Smith (Perry White) was a hoot with his plethora of Elvis references; the extremely talented John Shea was born to play a villian, delivering his lines perfectly as Lex Luthor; Michael Landes and Tracy Scoggins (Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant) made for amusing supporting players; and K Callen and Eddie Jones were perfect as Clark's supportive and loveable parents.

If you are considering purchasing this season, by all means go for it! They only wave of disappointment that overcame me during the viewing occurred at the last episode's conclusion, when I realized that there were no more episodes to watch, and I would have to wait at least six months for the next season.

Season 2 is even better, so hurry the heck up Warner Bros.!

PERRY: Ooh, I'm just not going to go near that.

LOIS: He's a man; I'm a woman. Do you want me to draw you a diagram?

CLARK: I just wanted to say goodbye.

LOIS: Goodbye? We're partners.

CLARK: You don't need a partner Lois, you never did.

LOIS: Well, maybe not, but I was starting to like having one.

***

LOIS: I said nine, I thought you'd be naked, umm, ready.

***

CLARK: Lois has a pair of Superman pajamas.

MARTHA: You saw Lois in her pajamas?

CLARK: No! Well, yes, but it was an accident, when her robe came undone.

***

LOIS: Mrs. Lex Luthor. Lois Lane Luthor. Lois Luthor Lane. Lois... Lane... Kent.

***

LOIS: And let's get something straight, I did not work my buns off to become an investigative reporter for the Daily Planet just to baby-sit some hack from Nowheresville! And another thing, you are not working with me, you are working for me. I call the shots, I ask the questions. You are low man - I am top banana and that's the way I like it, comprende?

CLARK: You like to be on top. Got it.

LOIS: Don't push me Kent, you are way out of your league.

***

LOIS: Well, what he can't do, it doesn't matter. It's the idea of Superman. Someone to believe in, someone to build a few hopes around. Whatever he can do, that's enough. I just wish that I could tell him that.

PERRY: ""I love the smell of fear in the newsroom.""

Teri Hatcher's sass and in-depth vulnerability made Lois Lane seem more like a woman you could possibly be, minus the numerous attempts on her life.

2255665,5,B00080ZG2O,"I watched this entire season box set over one weekend.

I've never done that before, with any television series. I just couldn't stop.

There are many things to pinpoint that makes this show rise above the other Superman incarnations (including, sadly, the initially promising Smallville which has turned into just another teen soap opera), and television in general.

First of all, the characterization of Lois as a strong, brilliant, independent woman, slightly annoying but intoxicatingly endearing, is a refreshing change from Margot Kidder's ditzy Lois or the original series' damsel-in-distress. All of the acting is totally believable, including the minor characters. Guest characters include all sorts of familiar faces, including Robert Beltran (Chakotay from ""Voyager""), Mike McKean, Jerry Hardin (""Deep Throat"" on The X-Files), and more.

Furthermore, the writing is superb. The characters are truly intelligent people, even Cat (Tracy Scoggins), the gossip columnist, and the decreasingly-naive Jimmy.

The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher is possibly even better than the Mulder/Scully chemistry on The X-Files.

Most of all, this series is exciting, and funny, and just plain entertaining to watch.

Maybe I'll watch the whole thing again next weekend. Meanwhile, everyone should buy this box set, so that they'll release the rest of the series without further delay.",1119225600,6,1393,5.604761904761904
2255666,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman The First Season is a FIVE STAR show if I ever saw one.

This show has a completely new take on the beginnings of the Characters. It is creative in a way that I believe would make Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster proud. I believe this because I have the distinction of having Parents that not only went to School with both of the creators, but were their friends and were there when Joe and Jerry first came up with the idea of Superman. I have grown up with all sorts of stories of how Superman came to be in the first place. My Father's brother was in Art class with Joe and Jerry and witnessed the very first sketches of the man of steel. Therefore my feelings of this new and innovative creation are very personal.

Given this information, I must say that Lois and Clark are absolutely fabulous. The set designs and costuming ring very true to the original as well as adding it's own mark. It is done in a way that will sustain a certain timelessness. The use of the 1940's and the current times combined together are ingenious. This was a very clever way of giving the show a look and feel that will last forever.

The stories may not follow the exact history of the original Superman, but nonetheless are so very creative that they make you want to watch every episode because of it's freshness. They are exciting, humorous, and romantic making the show enjoyable to watch. The sexual tension between Lois and Clark not only makes one root for them to get together, but also encourages us to not to miss a single episode.

Dean Cain is the perfect Clark Kent/Superman and adds a down to earth quality that everyone can relate to. He is not only very handsome and charming, but extremely talented and adds an innocence to the character that has not been seen before.

Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane adds a completely new spin to the character. She is not only talented in her own right, but is classy, sassy, sexy, intelligent and very much her own woman. She adds all these qualities to Lois and still has the ability to show a certain underlined vulnerability at the same time.

The qualities in both of these people make them the perfect match. There in lies the magic and success. The secret to any good show is not only the strength of the story telling but the main characters as well. They must be solid not only as individuals but have chemistry between them. Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman has it all.

When one adds up all these factors, it gives the show a freshness that doesn't take anything away from the original. On the contrary it adds a uniqueness that makes the show a classic in it's own right that will definitely stand the test of time.

In conclusion, I not only recommend you buying this season but suggest that you get the other three for it only gets better each year. My only regret is that the show didn't last longer than four years.

I am now completely hooked on the Smallville series, and can't wait to see the new Superman movie. I hope he gets together with Lois again. Superman without Lois may as well not have his super powers. They are intrinsic.",1118966400,3,435,4.4375

I did not get to watch the complete series though, so I am really happy that they made this series into DVDs. The quality of the DVDs are really good and you get special offers from Warner Bros.

2255669,4,B00080ZG2O,"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman came along at a time when Superman's popularity was at a low. It had been ages since a movie had come out (the abysmal Superman IV: The Quest for Peace in 1987). At the time, Time Warner had absorbed DC Comics and decided to resurrect the superhero but on TV instead of on the big screen. The network brought in Deborah Joy LeVine (who had very little TV experience at the time) to create and write the show's feature-length pilot episode. She hadn't even read a Superman comic before and envisioned a Moonlighting-style romantic comedy.

The show featured two new, fresh-faced talents, Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher and managed to maintain the homogenous utopia of the Christopher Reeves' movies. Everyone looks good, nobody seems to have any real problems (like paying rent or finding a job) and good and evil are easily identifiable. But that is kind of the point, right down to the city streets that are always clean and uncluttered-obviously shot on a soundstage. This is purely escapist fare for one to lose themselves in. Lois and Clark presents an idealized world as opposed to a realistic one.

Lois may be a tough-as-nails reporter but deep down she's a hopeless romantic at heart. Hatcher brings a sexy, girl-next-door vibe coupled with good comic timing (that she showcases to an even greater degree on Desperate Housewives) that catapulted her to fame when the show originally aired. She's gorgeous but also conveys a vulnerability that makes her endearing. Like WKRP in Cincinnati, Lois and Clark plays up the overt sexuality of ""Cat"" Grant (Scoggins) as the show's promiscuous bombshell when it is painfully obvious that it is Lois who is the real knockout (and has integrity as well).

Cain wisely doesn't try to copy Reeves' iconic performance from the movies but portrays Clark as a smart and idealistic guy who is the perfect foil for Hatcher's headstrong Lois. He has an engaging smile and all-American good looks that makes him ideal for the role. Cain doesn't have too much range but the role, as written, doesn't require much of him. The chemistry between him and Hatcher feels genuine and is definitely the appeal of the show. The give-and-take between them is cute and there is obviously some heat, some sexual tension brewing under the surface.

Ultimately, Lois and Clark is all about upholding strong, moral values and decency. This is represented most obviously with Clark's, straight-from-America's-heartland parents juxtaposed with the cynical, big city as represented by Lois and Perry White. The show attempts to demonstrate that some kind of harmony can exist between these two worldviews but when push comes to shove, it sides with the folksy, sage advice of the folks from Smallville.

The first DVD features an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by Dean Cain, executive producer LeVine and director Robert Butler. LeVine dominates the track as she talks about how the episode was supposed to establish Lois and Clark's personalities and their relationship (i.e. sexual tension). Cain is modest and talks about his experiences during the casting process and shooting this episode.

LeVine didn't want to alienate Superman fans but also wanted to do something different with the character. To test the waters so to speak, she cut a 20-minute reel from the pilot episode and showed it to fans at that year's San Diego Comic Con. This is footage is included on the DVD.

On the sixth DVD is a fine retrospective featurette entitled, ""From Rivals to Romance: the making of `Lois and Clark.'"" Cain and Hatcher appear in brand new interviews along with most of the other main cast members. Cain almost didn't get the role because the powers that be thought he was too young. LeVine wanted Lois to be a modern woman with a lousy social life and Hatcher liked her character's duality: tough exterior with a needy, romantic interior.

Finally, there is ""Taking Flight: the Visual Effects of `Lois and Clark'"" that takes a look at how the show's special effects were created. Not surprisingly, both Cain and Hatcher found the wire harness to be a painful experience.",1118880000,6,4141,4.948201438848921
2255670,4,B00080ZG2O,"Reimagining an American icon can be a challenge. Superman has been so much a part of the American landscape since his creation by Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster that his comic book visage dominated much of the mid to late 20th century. Superman and other comic book characters are part of our mythology our pulp literature tradition. Deborah Joy Levine had a daunting task; to update Superman for a TV audience without pandering to the camp style that dominated so many comic book TV adaptations. By focusing as much on the relationship between Superman's alter ego Clark Kent and Lois Lane she refocused the characters creating new appeal for a new audience. She obviously hit a nerve because the show was popular from the moment it premiered until it fly off into the sunset four years later.

During the first season we meet The Man of Steel for the first time as well as the reporters at The Daily Planet the newspaper where Clark Kent and Lois Lane work. The irrepressible Perry White (the great and underrated character late actor Lane Smith who passed away this month in a fun take on the character) their boss wants action, photos and, most of all, stories that sell newspapers. Superman sells newspapers so when his infatuated star reporter Lois makes it her mission to talk to The Man of Steel it gets done. We also meet Lex Luthor (the marvelously oily John Shea) for the first time as well who will, ultimately, become Superman's nemesis and rival for Lois' affections. Meanwhile ""Cat"" Grant (Tracy Scoggins) has her eyes on Clark for herself. This show is not only a testament to strong writing, direction and performances but great casting. Everyone in the series fit their roles perfectly (even the first season Jimmy Olsen played by Michael Landes although I appear to be in the minority in this opinion) and it's a testament to the fine eye of the casting director Lorna Johnson. Casting a series or movie is a difficult art at best and she's successfully done it for over a decade working on such series as ""Dawson's Creek"" and the cult classic ""Vengeance Unlimited"". So while kudos certainly should go to all that were involved in the production of the first season a special tip of the hat should go to Ms. Johnson. This is really the series where the cast and crew saw their careers take off. (with the exception of vets like Robert Butler who directed key pilot episodes for ""Moonlighting"", ""Star Trek"" and other shows. The pilot and director of it are important for establishing the overall tone and feel for the series)

Aside from some minor analog imperfections in the pilot episode, the series looks very good overall. The bright images are crisp and clear for the most part with nice flesh tones and color reproduction. A couple of episodes had their fair share of soft images (particularly, again, the pilot episode). The color is occasionally inconsistent during the visual effects sequences and there's more dirt and debris noticeable in these sequences as well. For a series that's 12 years old and had countless reruns ""Lois & Clark"" actually looks pretty darn good overall. The audio has nice presence with dialog that's crisp and clear. The stereo imaging is nicely used and the soundtrack no distortion that I can detect.

There's a 20 minute featurette on the presentation of the pilot episode at the 1993 ComicCon. Producer/writer LeVine discusses the reception of the pilot by the audience and the fears that they all had that it might not live up to their expectations. ""From Rivals to Romance"" focuses on the development of the characters throughout its run. Among those interviewed are Levine, John Shea, pilot director Robert Butler, actress Tracy Scoggins and some of the folks at DC comics. The initial creation and casting of the series is discussed as well particularly the difficulty in finding someone that could carry the series without resorting to the camp clichs that have dogged the genre on TV. There's also a brief visual effects featurette that demonstrates how some of the effects were achieved pretty simply whether it be the flying sequences or Superman's super strength. There's no featurette to discuss the casting changes during season two (that'll probably be addressed in the next set) when Michael Landes was replaced as Jimmy Olsen by Justin Whalin during the rest of the series' run on ABC.

There's a bonus DVD included with every package as part of Warner's 50th Anniversary of their Television division. This DVD includes the thematically appropriate ""Smallville"" which was developed as a teen version of ""Lois & Clark"" (although the series is inconsistent with ""Lois & Clark""). The episode presented ""Crusade"" is the 4th season premiere. I'm not a huge fan of ""Smallville"" so hadn't seen this episode and have to admit it was done pretty well.

Star Dean Cain and writer/producer Levine provide the commentary track along with pilot director/executive consultant Robert Butler on the double length pilot episode. Evidently this is the extra long version of the pilot which runs a bit longer than the final broadcast version. We discover lots of trivia as to why some things were cut, how Dean Cain ultimately ended up with the role and lots of useful insights that apply to the series run as well.

""Lois & Clark"" was highlight of the 1993 season. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher became the title characters during this popular series short run. While the fourth season found the show limping to a less than stellar conclusion, the first two seasons of the show was full of intelligent writing, direction and sharp performances. The third season although it had it's moments was where the series began to lose its footing. Fans of this popular series will be happy this is finally available on DVD and Warner Home Video has done a super job in putting this set together packed with extras. Another studio might have just packaged these episodes without any extras and an indifferent transfer. Warner has done an exceptional job here with the materials at hand. I'm tempted to leap buildings in a single bound (except I'd break a leg or two) I'm so happy with the way this set has been presented. While ""Lois & Clark"" wasn't invincible (the last season didn't have the superpowers of the first two), the show managed to overcome Kryptonite laced scripts in later seasons to remain an enduring reinvention of a classic American icon. Kudos to Warner Home Video and along with the cast/crew for doing such a terrific job in putting this set together!",1118880000,6,6513,4.857785778577858
2255671,5,B00080ZG2O,"Sure it got campy and downright stupid at times, but Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had one thing you need in a series : chemistry. Season One stuck to what a Superman TV should be about. Lois/Clark and the evil Lex Luthor.

Season One Box set offers a lot. Sadly, last looks at departed Lane Smith as the best Perry White ever. This season also had the cool Cat (Catherine Grant) to be a foil for Lois. Michael Landes wasn't my favorite Jimmy Olsen (I liked his successor much better) but looking back at these DVDs he was fun and could either play the straight man or funny whenever he was called to do either.

John Shea made a menacing Lex Luthor. It just seemed like the writers couldn't come up with much for him after this first season. He had potential to be so much more than what he ended up doing after Season One.

The Kents (Martha & Jonathan) were Ok for the time in which this show ran. I much prefer John Schneider and O'nette Otoole as the Kents on Smallville. They add dimensions to the show that these Kents didn't or couldn't because of how they were written.

The best episodes featured Lex Luthor bringing a somewhat serious threat against Superman and coming between Lois & Clark.

Honeymoon In Metropolis stands out as one of the most romantic episodes with Lois & Clark going on stakeout and having to be together in a honeymoon suite.

All Shook Up is another nice episode where Superman gets amnesia.

The Green, Green Glow Of Home is one of the few episodes to feature Smallville outside of the Kent Farm. Unfortunately it is not the likeable Smallville from the current TV show, but it is a relatively fun episode.

Pheremone, My Lovely is a great episode in which the bad guy (or girl) is less deadly and actually causes a lot of funny things to happen. This is Cat's best episode and Teri Hatcher is steaming hot as (Lois) she tries to seduce Clark.

Vatman stands out as a Superman vs Superman episode. Unfortunately they didn't call him Bizarro, but at least they used him. Here is where the writers tended to mess up with a huge villians gallery. Vatman was a pretty bad title as well. Why not just Bizarre, or Bizzaro?

Fly Hard was pretty nice in that it was based pretty much on Die Hard. Clark had to find a way to protect Lois/Perry/Jimmy & Lex without revealing he was Superman. It was a challange because they were all stuck in a room for the majority of the episode.

The House Of Luthor brought to a head the romance between Lex &  Lois. It left a lot up in the air to look forward to Season Two.

Overall if you liked Lois & Clark at all you should love this season. It was the best. Before Teri Hatcher cut her hair way too short. Before Lois and Clark got together and ruined the romantic/sexual tension that was as important to the show as it was to Moonlighting. Before Lex disappeared/reappeared and disappeared again. John Shea was missed in future seasons as was Cat she added sexual tension to the show that was missed when she was gone. Also this season was before cast members came and went or were replaced with different people confusing the viewers.

The storylines were basically about Clark/Lois and or Lex and of course Superman. The supporting cast picked up the rest and kept this show top notch in the first season. The same couldn't be said about future seasons when the show got too silly/campy and lost all bit of reality it had in season one. Buy this set if you loved the show. You won't regret it. I didn't.",1118880000,2,3472,4.421630094043887
2255672,4,B00080ZG2O,Ok I was about 5 or 6 when this show first came on the air..and I remember how every sunday my parents let me stay up late to watch it. I have always been a huge Superman fan and I believe that Chirstopher Reeve was and is Superman. But Dean Cain did do a good job. But...there were two things I didn't like about his Superman.  1: He slicked his hair back which Superman has always done...but there wasn't a single strand resting on his forehead in the shape of an S which is a clasic must for Superman. 2: Dean Cain's eyes are brown...Superman has Blue eyes. Other than those two things his Superman was ok..but not as good as Chirstopher Reeve's...but I did like Dean Cain's version of Clark..I think its nice to give Clark a more modern personality rather than a compelte clutz farmboy. But the reason that Clark was oringaly like that was because that was part of his cover up...no one would think..that even though Clark looked like Superman..that a clutzy nerdy farm boy could possiably be Superman. However the story and its over all feel make the show a great edition to the Superman Legacy.,1118793600,,1100,4.472636815920398

Older and wiser, I still find myself cracking up at some of bad puns, like having Sonny Bono guest star and tell Lois, ""I got you, babe,"" in reponse to a question about the heatwave, or the appearance of ""Sore Throat.""  The romantic tension has weathered the time well, though, with Lois' romantic longings well shown by Teri Hatcher, and Dean Cain's portrayal of the unrequitably good Superman.  I love how the show makes the relationship between Lois and Clark, not Lois and Superman, central, and makes Clark the real person and Superman the disguise he uses to help people.

It had vivid bright colors, good special effects, great sets and costumes.  I bought the DVD set today and see they have done a fine job on the box for presentation.  The special effects are, of course, surpassed by today's TV series--but still quite good!  Too bad they couldn't get a better film transfer.  For example, the Pilot Episode contains a number of white blotches (scratches) every now and then on the film!  I'm thinking that even though the show is not too old, and was syndicated, not a lot has been done to take care of it!  Great series!",1118102400,6,694,4.548387096774194

It made me a fan of superman again. I also learned alot about superman.  Teri Hatcher made that show, why it stayed on for only 4 years baffles me to this day.  Probably cause of abc network wanted more ratings.  If it was on wb or upn....they would still be on.  The series was absolutely fantastic. Right when the internet was budding....Teri Hatcher was the most downloaded person at that time.  She was on top the the world. The series should have been on dvd a long time ago.

2255683,5,B00080ZG2O,"Tune in at ground zero for one of television's greatest TV romances with Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete First Season! Developed by Deborah Joy LeVine (""Dawson's Creek"") and a brilliant staff of series writers including Thania St. John (""Roswell""), Lois & Clark takes the Man of Steel on his most exciting and challenging adventure of all - rivalry & romance (and later marriage) with Lois Lane!

Lois & Clark was easily one of my must-see, must-tape-commercial-free shows back during its first-run on ABC. Updated with a 90s sensibility, Lois & Clark brilliantly re-examined Superman through his relationship with Lois Lane, which evolved naturally during the course of the show's 4-year series run. The writing, performances, action and effects were always consistently effective. However, the main reason I faithfully tuned in to the show was for the interplay between Lois & Clark. The idea of Superman struggling thru relationship issues, like any other guy, while still doing the ""superhero thing"" was very appealing. Just look at the Spider-Man films for clear proof. No matter how weak some of the villains may have been regarded, the writers gave them just enough ""menace"" to justify Lois & Clark's investigative attention as the reporters sorted thru their personal stuff while in the process of ""getting the story."" Their chemistry & banter, like that of David Addison & Maddie Hayes in ""Moonlighting"" (another ABC hit and also available on DVD), are what viewers fondly remember most about the show.

Teri Hatcher (""Desperate Housewives"") & Dean Cain (""Ripley's Believe It, Or Not!"") star as the unbelievably ""real"" title characters. They not only look great as Lois & Clark, they simply are great. Dean Cain pulls off a decent Superman with easily the best build of his predecessors and an even cooler Clark Kent, who sports great suits and designer eye-frames, making him more appealing to women. Teri Hatcher, who recently won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in Desperate Housewives, clearly should've received an Emmy for her performance in Lois & Clark. Hatcher really BECOMES Lois Lane in this show - encompassing her beauty, intelligence, independence, tenacity and heart with incredible talent. Though, some viewers & critics did initially mock the sound of her voice and her progressive thinness as the show went on. However, Hatcher's beauty and sex appeal were never questioned as TV Guide once proclaimed her as ""The Sexiest Woman in Cyberspace"" (most downloaded), dethroning then-reigning queen Cindy Margolis.

I'd be remiss to not mention John Shea (""Mutant X"") as the charasmatic yet deadly Lex Luthor. His exceptional performance rates up there with Murder One's Richard Cross and Alias' Arvin Sloane as standout TV baddie. The rest of the supporting cast are a delight as well including Lane Smith (""V"") as Elvis-lovin' Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White; Michael Landes & Tracy Scoggins as photographer Jimmy Olsen & columnist Cat Grant, respectively - both only appearing in this season one set; and of course Eddie Jones & K Callan as Jonathan & Martha Kent. I loved those cute scenes like where they first meet Lois: Martha leads Lois out of the room to freshen up, looks back at Clark and Jonathan and silently mouths to Clark ""I love her!"" to which Clark dismisses her with a playful ""get outta here"" wave. I also liked how the writers addressed common Superman issues such as ""the glasses"" in the pilot where Clark (wearing the final suit) is checking himself in a mirror when Martha, looking on, quips ""Well one thing's for sure, no one's going to be looking at your face."" An embarrassed Clark snaps ""Mom!"" Martha retorts ""Well, they don't call them 'tights' for nothing."" Great stuff.

Lois & Clark - The Complete First Season is a 1034 min. 6-disc set, which features all 21 episodes in full frame (1.33:1) picture, and stereo sound. The super extras include: ""From Rivals to Romance"" series retrospective, visual effects featurette, Dean Cain Pilot commentary, original pilot presentation and one bonus DVD containing ""Crusade,"" the season 4 premiere of Smallville, the other popular Superman-related show, which no doubt influenced the release of this Lois & Clark DVD. So don't ""skip Smallville and fly to Lois & Clark"" as another reviewer advised, but instead add it to your Superman collection along with Smallville. Treat yourself to one of the most anticipated TV DVD releases this side of ""Roswell!""

If you go back to the very FIRST Superman and come all the way up to now, you'll notice changes had to be made.

It was only when I grew up and was in high school that I started watching the show on TNT in 2000- 2001. I watched it in the mornings when it was summer vacation. It was a usual morning and I was clicking through the channels and came across it. I watched the episode (I forget which episode it was) and after that episode I fell in love with the series, and watched the rest of the series every morning.

The show is well it's just awsome! The storyline and plots were always filled with action, comedy, drama, romance, and tense. I love the series more because of the drama. Any Superman fan would love this series, and even new fans I believe would like it too. I'm glad that WB is putting it on dvd. And like what everyone else has said- I wonder when the rest of the seasons (2-4) would be put on dvd. Hopefully we won't have to wait long( crosses fingures)",1114560000,10,1021,4.182741116751269
2255689,5,B00080ZG2O,Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is the #1 Superman TV series ever. I am been waiting for this day.  I watched Lois and Clark every Sunday nights on ABC when I was 10 through 14 and since this day.  I did also watched Lois and Clark on TNT and TBS every mornings when it was showing reruns. I was disappointed when TBS put it off the air and just been showing Dawn Creek. I am excited that Lois and Clark is coming on DvD now.  Right now I am watching Smallville the third best Superman series.  I also been watching the 90s through 2005 cartoon series: Batman The Animated Series/The New Batman - Superman Adventures to Justice League Unlimted the second best series/saga. I just brought the Superman movies with starring Christopher Reeve. Now I will buy the Lois & Clark Series and probably Smallville too.,1114387200,9,821,4.489932885906041

2255691,5,B00080ZG2O,"1993. A new Superman incarnation hits the airwaves. Unlike previous approaches to the character, Clark is the real person and Superman is the disguise. Superman himself is also less of a greek god and more of a ""boy next door"" - with superpowers. Lastly, a strong emphasis is placed on the wonderfully bizarre and unique relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane.

Suffice it to say, ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" didn't go down well with most Superman fans. But never fear! Despite the reservations, and in some cases, venomous bile of hardcore supporters of the boy in blue, ""Lois and Clark"" was a frequently stylish, witty, irreverent, charming and altogether refreshing take on (at that time) a 55 year old legend.

Just how did Lois and Clark succeed in this, its first - and finest - season of episodes? The secret lay in its casting: Dean Cain was impossibly buff and good looking as Clark/Superman and Teri Hatcher was near enough his sexual equal as Lois. In the same screen space, their chemistry set the series on fire. What's more, in ""Lois and Clark""s debut season, they were backed by stellar writing and a formidable supporting cast: Lane Smith was perfectly cast as scowling newspaper editor Perry White, John Shea made a fantastically devious Lex Luthor and Michael Landes held his own as photographer Jimmy Olsen.

Unlike its latter seasons (in which the show became progressively lighter and unbelievable), the first season of ""Lois and Clark"" superbly balanced pathos and humour, love and danger, action and inaction, happiness and horror. Notable highlights include the pilot episode in which a program to build an international space station is threatened by sabotage, ""The Green, Green Glow of Home"" in which Superman encounters Kryptonite for the first time, ""Man of Steel Bars"" in which Superman is suspected of causing a heatwave and jailed for using his powers, ""Honeymoon in Metropolis"" in which Lois and Clark share a hotel suite whilst investigating high level political corruption, ""All Shook Up"" in which Superman intercepts an asteroid and suffers memory loss, and the closing two-parter ""Barbarians at the Planet""/""House of Luthor"" in which the Daily Planet is shut down and Lex proposes to Lois, threatening to split Lois and Clark up forever...

Heady stuff! If you plan on getting the later seasons, tread carefully. Executive Producer Deborah Joy LeVine was sacked at the end of Season One as television network ABC demanded stronger ratings and brought in a replacement - the show was never the same again. But before all that happened, here's the perfect encapsulation of what once was. Highly recommended.",1114214400,11,2669,5.0590909090909095

Anothe cast favourite was Cat Grant played by Tracey Scoggin, i loved her character. About time it came to DVD, i have been waiting for this for a very long time, as no one plays videos anymore and i wondered when it would get a release date, as i can not watch videos anymore because i have an dvd player, i have preordered mine already as i am an UK fan, and i am not waiting for the UK release date which will be forever. Also included is Smallville episode Crusade, i love Smallville and it is one of my favourite shows from the USA right now, but when will they release season 4 to buy as i have 1 to 3 on DVD and i want season 4 of Smallville, as i will preorder that from the USA instead of waiting for the UK release date, i think Tom Welling and Erica Durance have better chemistry then Dean and Teri, and the storylines are better on Smallville, as i am older now and it is an newer show and one of my favourites, but Lois and Clark comes Second place as it is an older show, but i will definetly buy this as i loved this when i was an teenager.",1114041600,2,1842,4.008152173913044

This wonderful series deserves the DVD treatment much more than most of the series that get released today.  Why did we have to wait so long?  Please don't make us wait ages for seasons 2-4.  Very pleased to see that Dean Cain is providing some commentary for the pilot.  For me, season 1 was not my favourite, much preferring Seasons 2 & 3.  However, it will certainly take pride of place in my DVD collection.  Also, as a UK viewer, when they originally aired, many of the episodes were cut, due to both transmission times (5pm for seasons 1-3 with repeats on a Saturday morning on kids TV) and for timeslot reasons.  Rather than being allocated a full hour (44 mins I think excluding commercials), it was reduced to 40 mins (with no commercials).

I grew up reading the Superman comic books which were pretty good but as I grew older I found the stories were very similar after a while and there wasn't really any ""good"" Lois and Clark stories. When this series aired I anxiously watched it hoping it wouldn't be some half-baked, thrown together series. I was truly awed by it, that ABC got it right! To have Superman as a secondary character and let Clark and Lois (and of course, the supporting cast) be the primary characters. Some of the stories were a little out there but it was great. The producers really understood the mechanics, to place the emphasis on the ongoing relationship of Lois and Clark and also Superman. All of the stories were incredibly done with great detail to the continuity of the characters. Lois Lane, Perry White, Jimmy Olson, Lex Luthor, Clark Kent, Ma and Pa Kent..... all of these wonderful people brought to life in an astounding way be some of the greatest and talented actor's ever seen! John Shea's Lex Luthor is awesome, K. Kalan as Martha Kent is exactly what I have always pictured MA KENT to be like. Thank You ABC for making such a great TV Series and thanks to everyone for finally bringing it out on DVD! Now just don't make us wait 2 1/2 years to own the entire series and I will be estatic!!!!!!",1113177600,5,1348,4.506122448979592

I've seen every episode, and I have all the episodes on tape, but they're not that great in quality. What I liked about Lois & Clark was when Clark used his powers as ""Clark"", and not just Superman.

  Even now, I see someone who was a guest star on the show, and I think, ""They were on an episode of Lois & Clark"". What's really cool, is that the DVD set will be released the week before my birthday.

Thanks to the Powers that be for releasing this terrific show on DVD!!!!

2255698,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois & Clark:TNAOS, what can I say. It's the series that's closest to my heart. Teri and Dean's chemistry is so unbeatable when it comes to generations of Superman shows, even Tom and Kristin Kreuk's Clark and Lana of Smallville couldn't hold a candle to it. I wasn't a fan during LnC's initial run every Sunday night, but when I caught this show's reruns on TNT, I became an instant fan! Smallville may be better than LnC technologically and plot-wise, but it missed on something that LnC delivered...LnC gave the audience a heartwarming spin on two lonely people who find each other--this is something NO Superman show had ever done. It presented a couple relatable and endearing to everyone and it also added a whole cast of characters like Jimmy, Perry, Cat, Lex, Martha&Jonathan Kent and a whole slew of characters that added humor and depth to this series without taking away from its main couple Lois&Clark.

Originally, I didn't think Dean Cain would make a good Superman because he doesn't look at all close to Superman (Not by a longshot!). But after seeing his depiction of Clark Kent, I can't think of anyone playing a better and more human Clark.

This is a definite MUST HAVE DVD for every romantic at heart!",1112227200,10,1222,4.732394366197183
2255699,5,B00080ZG2O,"I am so happy that Warner Brothers is releasing this superb TV series on DVD.  I remember walking in New York back in 1993 seeing all the black and white posters of Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher adverstising for this new series.  I said this better be good and it was GREAT!  The chemistry between not only Dean and Teri but the whole cast is just wonderful. I still have everysingle episode on VHS tapes from all 5 seasons.  I hope that the studios will release the remaining seasons in time.  The only disppointing thing was the last episode of season 5 when they ended up with their baby.  Sometimes it is hard to wrap up a show when the network decides to pull it from the line up.  I know both Teri and Dean are busy with their new projects but it would be GREAT if ABC would do a two hour movie wrap up of the series.  I am positive Dean can still fit in those tights and teri never looked better.  It would be great too, if ABC would get Dean Cain on Desperate Housewives and hook him up with Teri again.  They do have such believeable chemistry.",1112227200,8,1050,4.17910447761194
2255700,5,B00080ZG2O,"The first season wasn't that good, it was the same thing I saw the original adventures of Superman that it was getting kind of getting old. The show showed a lot more improvement in the second season because more of a family than colleagues working together. Before Smallville came on the air, their was Lois and Clark the new adventures of Superman. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher who played Clark Kent and Lois Lane they look like more like teenagers than adults. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are like the adult Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk of Lois and Clark: The new adventures of Superman.  After the show was over Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk took over the characters of Clark Kent and Lana Lang of a prequel of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.",1112140800,,760,4.547445255474453
2255701,5,B00080ZG2O,"The Superman I grew up with was George Reeves in the show that ran from 1952-1957.  Reeves' acting was rather wooden, his Superman was grim and one-dimensional, and with each show being only a half-hour, there wasn't much time for plot development.

From there I read the comic books and even though their Superman had more of a personality than Reeves, he was still just this cardboard cutout. I thought the movies were ok, but they were still focused on Superman, rather than the person where he spent most of his time.

""Lois and Clark"" is IMO the best Superman yet.  Dean Cain and Terry hatcher had an excellent chemistry, and the focus was on Clark rather than Superman.  One memorable line is when Clark tells Lois, ""Clark is who I am.  Superman is what I can do.""

I think the show jumped the shark when Clark and Lois got married, perhaps even when they became ""an item.""  Some of the tension that made up their relationship - the ironic love triangle between Ckark, Lois, and Superman - was lost when Lois finds out Clark's identity, but the show was still way ahead of any other treatments of Superman that have yet to be offered.

Like many other fans, I have been waiting for the series to come out on DVD for years.  I hope they don't take as long for subsequent seasons.",1111968000,6,1284,4.472103004291846

2255707,5,B00080ZG2O,"I cannot believe it has been 10 years since I first saw this show.  I was 15 at the time, and I remember eagerly tunning in each Sunday night to watch.

I had never been a big fan of superman personally, having grown up with Xmen comics and Marvel, I never did read many DC comics.  However, this show really brought something special to the Superman mythos- it brought a sense of the characters as being real people.  It was great to see such great character portrayals by Terri and Dean.  Their chemistry was obvious and they played their role to perfection.  The initial love/hate relationship of the first season was so well done, it kept me on the edge of my seat thinking, when is she going to find out?  I still remember that one episode where he grabs her and Jimmy (it was also in the TV intro at one point) and flies them as a bomb explosdes in the background; she still didn't put two and two together, and accepted his excuse that the bomb's explosion must have propelled them like that. Haha, it was great.

The supporting cast was the best I've seen, with Perry White played to perfection. The constant Elvis references by Perry were truly funny.  Cat was ok, but she was largely forgetfull, since I was only reminded she was in the show by reading another reviewer.  Jimmy had two actors play him; I'm not sure who was better, but let's just say they both, in their way, hit Jimmy right on the head.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to see much of the last parts of season 3 and 4, because at that time I had gone off to college.  But hopefully the WB will release all seaons of this show.

Lately, I've been running out of stuff to buy (TV series wise) because it seems all the great shows I loved, I either already bought, or have not been released.  This makes me sad, considering the appaling number of dumb old TV shows that are being released.  WB is pretty good at releasing dvds, unlike Fox, which I'm still hating since they have not released ""Space: Above and Beyond"" yet and don't seem to have any plans to do so.

Anyway, I want to buy this show. I never had the foresight to tape the show, and thus, I have not seen it in almost ten years.  I still remember many of the episodes, and who can forget the pilot, where Clark leaves that hand print on the bus.  This show is part of a lot of my teenager memories, so please, WB, now that you are releasing season 1, I hope you don't stop, and soon release the rest 3 seasons.",1111449600,6,2445,4.278260869565218

2255710,4,B00080ZG2O,"This 1991-1997 ABC series reignited interest in the superman legend by now focusing on Clark Kent's life and thus relegating Superman to a supporting role in the Metropolis reporter's life.

He still showed up to save Metropolis and Earth, but Superman was regarded as less a separate person than a cover for Clark Kent's other-worldly powers. Contrasting with the previous incarnations, both Clark and Superman get their fair share of on screen treatment.  This 1993-1994 22-episode season has superhero greatness itself.

Coming off of a guest-staring role on Beverly Hills 90210, Dean Cain proves that it is possible for actors to simultaneously have beefcake and brains. Cain never looked puzzled while delivering his lines and thus made this series so much more than a televised Superman movie, personally writing some of this series's scripts himself. Even in `romantic' scenes, Cain convincingly portrayed a professionally-trained reporter wanting to do the right thing in his very busy life. This series would have bombed and royally if Kevin Sorbo had instead received the Clark/Superman role (which he actually read for)!

Michael Landes's Jimmy Olson is a refreshing twist on another often maligned character. `Lois and Clark's' Jimmy wears really stylish clothes suggesting that he is a ladies man. Jimmy Olson thus becomes upgraded from junior sidekick of the `adults' to an adult himself in this television series. He even gets an episode of his own ""The house of Luthor, part II"" where he helps research Lex Luthor's (John Shea) connection to the buyout and downfall of the Daily Planet.  I honestly did not remember seeing this first season where Landes had played Jimmy, so being able to see his performance through these DVD's was a good experience.

My favorite episodes this season include the two part pilot which explains that Lois had inadvertently helped Clark to create Superman, also showing the process which Clark then goes through to become the world-famous superhero. I'm partial to ""requiem for a superhero"" because Lois and Clark officially become reporting partners in that episode and Lois learns her father, Dr. Sam Lane (this episode played by Denis Arndt) is responsible for creating very strong robots-which of course go haywire.  In  ""The green, green, glow of home""  Clark takes Lois home to Smallville to meet his parents Martha and Jonathan Kent (K Callahan and Eddie Jones) when a strange meteor is discovered; naming it Kryptonite, Clark also discovers that it makes him sick.

Since Lois does not yet know Clark's secret or Superman's real identity, this season is packed with delicious tension. Lois is smitten with Superman, but only has (at this point at least) platonic feelings for Clark. She is also peeved by her partner's frequent and unexplained disappearances and absences. Clark himself becomes befuddled trying to explain things.

Phyllis Coates (who played Lois in the 1950's TV show) has a recurring role as Lois Lane's equally-strong willed mother in an extra built into the screenplay itself. Lois prides herself on being tough, but she is no match for her own mother. Both Lanes are incredibly tough cookies with a soft side revealed only to the most dedicated of suitors.  Lois is initially convinced that Clark looks down on her family life for being less than perfect, but ultimately learns that it matters much less than what kind of person she is.",1111104000,14,3414,5.1315315315315315

Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I feel that the fans deserve a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. What gets me is some tv shows being released on DVD now days didn't even do half as good as Lois & Clark or last more than one season, and yet they seem to get released. I encourage all of the fans to write to Warner Bros. and/or voice your opinion and write your reviews on the show here on amazon. Remember it's the wheel that squeaks that gets the oil. Below is a complete episode list of the first Season of Lois & Clark in hopes that the first season will see a DVD release soon.

I believe many of them are not aware of this item here (item #B00080ZG2O) and if amazon corrected it many more fans would be aware of the release date.",1111017600,18,3053,4.322862129144852

I got hooked on this show as soon as I watched the pilot episode and am thrilled to know that I'm finally going to get to own it on DVD.  Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher were just perfect as Clark and Lois, especially in the first two seasons.  This one has been added to my ""buy immediately"" list.",1110758400,,538,4.235294117647059

I can't believe some of the shows coming out on DVD and this one hasn't even been considered as of yet on DVD.

2255724,5,B00080ZG2O,"I have to say that this is my most favorite of shows. I am a big romantic and this show and these characters turned Lois and Clark into what i think is a classic show.  First of all there is Dean Cain who one of the most goergous men on earth, that combined with the chemistry he had with Teri Hatcher really hooked me on the show. after all the show was centered on their romance, they pulled it off splendidly. the way he looked at her throughout the show, you only wish someone would look at you like that. with total love and devotion. even now it gives me goosebumps. it was a shame it did not last longer on screen. this is why i hope they convert Lois and Clark onto DVD very very very very quickly. it would be so wonderful to have the show with no commercials and no static ( like from old tapes) and to have commentaries from the actors and directors and maybe some background info ( like bloopers, deleted scenes, interveiews, etc.) anyway this show deseves to be made into DVD if not for posterity but for all the loyal fans out there and i know there are a lot who want this to happen.",1108080000,5,1098,4.154929577464789

I have seen practically every episode. It was the first show that had me routing for the guy and the girl to get together! It was a torture that kept me watching every single week! I've love both the leads and any excuse to see Dean Cain with his shirt off is more than welcome!

Please GOD please.... what does it take to speed this up???",1105228800,7,484,4.03125
2255728,5,B00080ZG2O,"The fans have finally been heard and we have the first season of the ""Superman for the nineties"", ""Lois And Clark - The New Adventures of Superman"". Although long a fan of the show and having seen most episodes many times while the show was on and later in repeats (which unfortunately haven't been on in several years), it's nice to see the first season on DVD.

Beginning with the Pilot episode, which plays like a full length film, we see a Clark Kent who is not a bumbling, fumbling loser constantly pushing oversized glasses back in place (a la Christopher Reeve)and who isn't willing to back down from Lois Lane (the exquisite Teri Hatcher)just to please her.

We know from the start that a ""partnership"" is developing here, something Clark sees and Lois doesn't (it always seems the man seems to know first...it's the woman who plays hard to get), but we get a genuine appreciation of friendship between the two characters.

In the end, Superman is more a supporting player in this show, as it is more about Lois Lane and Clark Kent with Supes just along for the occasional ride.

Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen was a departure from previous depictions of the character and was solid, though not solid enough to be brought back for seaosn two. Perry White as played by the late Lane Smith (""Great shades of Elvis!"")was great as the father figure and mentor to Jimmy and the hard on the outside, soft on the inside editor of the Daily Planet. Probably his most touching scene of the first season was when he decided to go bungee jumping on his fiftieth birthday and Jimmy thought the worst.

Lois and Clark had a chemistry and we probably would have seen it develop faster were it not for the incomparable John Shea as Lex Luthor. Sure, it's a different interpretation, Lex with hair and all, and it could be a little over the top sometimes, but Shea brought an ""evil sophistication"" to the role. Unfortunately, he, too, would be gone after season one.

The other face not back for season two, Tracey Scoggins as Cat Grant really wasn't much of a loss. Ms Scoggins may be an attractive woman but she served a comedic purpose that had no point and spouted non-sequitors that had nothing to do with the plot itself. I would cringe at the scenes she was in...fortunately she didn't have too much screen time per episode.

In the end, though, it was about Lois and Clark and the interplay between the two of them and the suspension of belief that a pair of glasses was all it took to throw the ""best investigative reporter"" off the scent regarding Clark Kent/Superman. Never did it occur to her that they had the exact same voice.

Favorite episodes include:

The Pilot - Our introduction to the characters and some great effects. Plus we get to see Teri Hatcher in a dress (see, I remember thinking how annoying this Lois Lane was until that scene...strange how perceptions change quickly).

Neverending Battle - A test of strength and speed as Lex Luthor sizes up the Man Of Steel.

I've Got A Crush On You - So Lois can sing, too? Every male in the joint was looking at her. The scene where Clark dumps Lois in the garbage was priceless.

The Green, Green Glow Of Home - Lois feels out of sorts in Clark's hometown and meets Clark's parents.

The Man Of Steel Bars - Is Superman and his powers responsible for the city's heatwave? Superman (and Clark) decide to say goodbye.

Pheromone, My Lovely - Lois shows her wilder side to Clark, Perry gets a black eye from the husband of the Planet's cleaning lady...but not after a very (very!)bad Elvis impersonation.

Honeymoon In Metropolis - Lois And Clark in the honeymoon suite on the trail of a crooked congressman.

All Shook Up - Clark and Superman have amnesia after Superman flys into outer space to stop an asteroid from hitting Earth. Watching Ma Kent shove her son off that balcony was priceless.

Illusions Of Grandeur - A magician has Superman believing that wrong is right.

Foundling - A strange globe is discovered then stolen and sold to Lex. Our first introduction to Jack.

Vatman - Lex makes his own Superman, who doesn't exactly play by the rules.

Barbarians At The Planet/The House Of Luthor - These final two episodes begin with the downfall of the planet, it's rescue from oblivion by Lex, the destruction of the Planet, Lois agreeing to marry Lex, Clark declaring his love for Lois and Superman trapped in a kryptonite box as Lois walks down the aisle...

All of the episodes shine from season one and only whet our appetites for season two...and three...and four (and for those of us who are particularly smitten by the beautiful Miss Hatcher, we'll also put Desperate Housewives, Season One on the list as well...).

Season two is on the way in January...the legend continues.",1105142400,9,4753,4.633333333333334

2255732,5,B00080ZG2O,"""Lois & Clark"" was one of those shows that just about everyone talked about at the water cooler Monday morning (it aired Sunday nights on ABC).  It is a timeless classic that put an attractive and entertaining spin on the traditional Superman mythology.  ""Lois & Clark's"" conception of the well-known heroes, villains, and stories connected with Superman lore were enjoyable to say the least, and I feel the show was produced with a desire to retain the spirit of the Superman story as it was originally told, but packaged in an updated, modern version that can appeal to people of a newer generation, just as The WB is doing now with ""Smallville.""

If this series is produced on DVD, you can be certain that the money I will immediately put forth for my own DVD set of ""Lois & Clark"" will be money well spent.",1102723200,7,810,4.572413793103448

2255737,1,B00080ZG2O,"I was very disappointed when this series hit the airwaves. It was for one reason and one reason only:Dean Cain. Out of all the actors who have portrayed the man of steel,Cain was by far the worst. I was so relieved that he wasn't cast in the new Superman movie. Every actor who has put on the cape,has had to meet certain requirements. They must have the right facial look,they must have a commanding voice,and must have an athletic body. It is obvious that these qualities were not required for Lois and Clark. I will say that Cain had the muscles,but that was all he had. He didn't have the voice and he didn't have the face. There is a fact about this show,I feel is worth mentioning. Actor Gerard Christopher(played Superboy in the 1980's T.V. series)auditioned and won the role of Superman. He was cut when it was discovered that he played Superboy. BAD MISTAKE!!!. Gerard Christopher (except for Christopher Reeve)looked and acted the part better than anybody. It would have been nice to see him make the transition from Superboy to Superman. This series is a waste of time for the true Superman fan. Smallville is ten thousand times better! Some people have been criticizing my point of view and have even criticized me personally,but this is my opinion and I'm sticking with it. Unlike other Superman fans,I HAVE TASTE!",1100476800,5,1327,4.724137931034483

Finally!  I echo the reviews posted on Amazon regarding this classic series.  Can't wait till the set streets!

""Sidebar"": '05 is looking like it's going to be a monster year for TV/DVD releases.  Great news for collectors like myself  :).

2255739,5,B00080ZG2O,"Christopher Reeves was an excellent big screen Superman because he played the classic role, but this primetime 90's series was the first to really focus on a Clark-centric storyline. Even the 'soapy' portions of this series cannot tarnish this all-around excellent product which viewers receive.

Dean Cain is an excellent actor who can easily pull a 'brooding' look while also sounding intelligent (duh, Cain actually went to Princeton!). Building on the ""Lois's"" of the past, Teri Hatcher is an independent and assertive career woman (think a female version of Woodward and Bernstein rolled together) who still senses that she is missing something from her 'successful' life---Mr. very right!

While she eventually does find out her coworker's secret, she is annoyed by his frequent disappearances and 'strange' behavior during this season.

Also unlike before, Clark himself now is supposed to look very hot to the viewers. Gone are the days of the bookish 'nerd' who characterized earlier film, radio, and comic versions of the Kansas farm boy with a very special secret. In those versions, Superman was held up as the ideal, but women were not supposed to lust after Clark. This Clark is both brains and brawn, the latter is shown off very nicely in his spandex-like 'Superman' outfit.

Thankfully, that costume appears to be mostly Cain's real body instead of some over pumped Hollywood prop!

You can tell that ABC..etc really spent a lot of time, money, and thought putting together this series because the sets look very detailed.

We don't have to put up with annoying inconsistencies which have insisted that Ma and Pa Kent are capable of driving from Smallville into Metropolis (which is supposed to be New York City!) in a single day--minus the Superman Express. Even during the all-critical first season (with a different Jimmy instead of Justin Whalin who would have this part during later seasons) the show genuinely draws viewers in.

Even if this release does not have any extras, it will be nice to own a series which managed to 'update' the Superman saga without throwing in absurdities. Clark's parents (played by Eddie George and K Callahan) are open-minded people, but they were ultimately small-town country farmers who only want the best for their son.

Since rumors suggest that this series finally will be released, do yourself a favor. Skip Smallville and fly towards Lois and Clark. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",1100304000,113,2460,5.086848635235732

Ten years older and wiser, to my surprise, I have more appreciation and respect for this show.  I fell in love with it all over again.  Lois and Clark definitely stood the test of time.  IMHO, this is by far the best treatment of the Superman myth.  This series had its own brand of charm, which reels you in, and makes you come back for more even after it has long been gone.

Never have I seen or most probably will ever see a better portrayal of Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher made these comic book heroes come alive with their characterization and extraordinary chemistry. Not to forget, a very talented supporting cast and creative writers adding up to a great series.

Unfortunately, TBS stopped airing after a week of watching the reruns.  Add to that, and to my utter disappointment, it hasn't been released on DVD.  I have since gotten VHS copies of the series from a fellow fan but it's slowly and steadily deteriorating from repeated viewing. Lois and Clark is a show deserving to be on DVD.

 There have been very lame DVD televison series that have come out, and the big question is why not Lois & Clark? This show was great. I agree with the other reviews, the chemistry was wonderful bewteen Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain. The story lines were good until about the last season, but even so it was great. It is a perfect time to put Lois & Clark on DVD because of Smallville and all the superhero movies. People are crazy about superheros.

This certainly is a better show then some of the DVD's that are out there, so please listen to these requests and put Lois & Clark on DVD!!!",1092268800,,736,4.169014084507042

I did see it being aired on TBS really early in the morning on weekdays, but since then I have not seen any sign of the show, its like it dropped off the face of the earth! I would buy the dvds as soon as they came out, and still hoping they do.  They were funny, suspenseful, romantic and the actors played amazing roles!

I watched it everytime it was on and loved every minute it was the only time I had time for myself in a busy house hold. Now that I have grad. college and I am 24 years old. I started to collect some of my fave movies I have seen along with T.V. series's I used to watch. Many have came and went. I had my intrest sparked and thought what was my all time fave series? Well you guessed it I picked the one that didn't  go to making copys like the rest. I would love to be able to buy lois and clark the new adventures of superman. It was funny romantic and something all girls should watch Lois-Terri Thatcher was my fave actress and still is one of the most beautiful and most talented actresses I have ever seen. Not to mention Superman- Dean Cain he was absoultly gorgous. They are my fave. and the whole cast including the chief and Jimmy were someone you could grow to love they had thier faults and their good points just like we do I loved the series and would love the oppertunity to buy it. I just wish I knew who to get in touch with to get a copy. If anyone knows anything let me know hugs

2255761,5,B00080ZG2O,"Seeing previews of Teri Hatcher's and Dean Cain's new fall shows reminded me that I miss ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" and it must absolutely be made available on DVD for fans of the show!

 Teri and Dean had such wonderful chemistry together and Dean was the perfect actor to play kind, loyal, somewhat nerdy Clark (but who still looked HOT in those glasses) and had the body to play Superman. I loved their verbal banter especially in the early seasons when she barely gave Clark the time of day...and I remember their first date. SIGH...what wonderful memories!

 I agree with some of the other reviews posted here...there are some ridiculous shows that have been marketed into a DVD set...if those can be produced into DVD, then Lois & Clark certain can!

 The DVD may even gain a new following with the popularity of Smallville and action films such as Spiderman2. Teri and Dean certainly have more chemistry with each other than Tobey and Kirsten...sorry.

 To the producers, marketers, and all those involved with this would-be project--PLEASE, PLEASE listen to the fans and put together a DVD set of this wonderful show!!!

  It is a real bummer that this series has yet to come out on DVD.  Warner Bros, or whoever has the rights to the series, needs to get on top of this.  This series is one that was very popular during generation X and had such a cult following...just like other shows (e.g. Buffy the Vampire slayer, Angel, and now...Smallville).

We would like to have this series in the comfort of our homes.  Whoever has the power, .... PLEASE use it to get this show on DVD.

2255764,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I feel that the fans deserve a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. What gets me is some tv shows being released on DVD now days didn't even do half as good as Lois & Clark or last more than one season, and yet they seem to get released. I encourage all of the fans to write to Warner Bros. and/or voice your opinion and write your reviews on the show here on amazon. Remember it's the wheel that squeaks that gets the oil. Below is a complete episode list of the first Season of Lois & Clark in hopes that the first season will see a DVD release soon.

2255765,5,B00080ZG2O,O.k I have written something b4 hand and still they tend to prolong our earning of the series of a lifetime. I mean if they can bring out t.v series that weren't as popular as lois and clark adventures they shouldn't advertise on amazon or whomever. It was a great series and i tend to buy it over the net from amazon cause they provide DVD's earlier on b4 it even gets out here in australia or won't even reach our shores. So for someone who has an ocean that divides what i really want i'm willing to write out bout it and request that they produce LOIS & CLARK:NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN on DVD.

2255772,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois and Clark was one of my favorite TV shows ever. At first I began to watch it since I have been a fan of Superman since I was a little kid but I was surprised by how well the characters were developed in the series. They seemed very much like real people and there was always a tension between the two central characters that was building up over time.
I know that every time that I go to a Best Buy I see all these different TV series that are available as box sets and I keep hoping that one day I will see Lois and Clark available on DVD. I just wonder why Warner is taking so long to release it. There is obviously a fan base who would purchase it.
I was a little sad to see it end as it did but luckily I found a few good fan fiction sites that continued the story from where the last episode ended.
Anyway, Warner if you are listening, just release the series on DVD already. I am waiting with money in my hand to purchase it on DVD.",1083888000,13,943,3.9424083769633507
2255773,5,B00080ZG2O,This television show was the epitome of good television.  I've been awaiting this title on DVD since they began putting tv shows on DVD.  I think it would appeal to many fans of Smallville as well.  Dean Cain is the ultimate Superman.,1083628800,4,234,4.523809523809524
2255774,5,B00080ZG2O,"So many forgettable shows are being released on DVD, why not this one! This show was big for ABC in the 18-49 demographic ratings every Sunday night, at least until they treated it inappropriately. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had unbelievable chemistry from coworkers to friends to lovers. The backup roles were played really well and the plots were always witty and interesting. It was good TV back then. Why can't you guys make it a Great DVD for us!",1080864000,2,451,4.65
2255775,5,B00080ZG2O,"Lois & Clark is perhaps one of the best television shows that I have ever seen. I have been a Superman fan for a long time now, and this show brought the classic Superman saga back to life. Everything about this show was done the right way. First of all, the show itself featured a wonderful mix of action, comedy, and romance. This managed to satisfy all different types of people. Some fans would watch the show due to Superman and his powers, while others would watch the show to watch the romance between Clark and Lois play out.
Lois & Clark features perhaps the best casting picks I have ever seen. Every actor chosen for the show was perfect for the part that they played. Dean Cain was able to turn both characters off and on very easily. He nailed the geeky and adorable charm of Clark Kent, and the strong hero persona of Superman. Teri Hatcher personified Lois Lane. She not only posessed the beauty of the character, but she also brought the attitude, spunk, and her talent for comedy as well. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher probably had the best on screen chemistry that I have ever seen, and they really made the relationship between Clark and Lois believeable. Lane Smith was great as Perry White. He brought the tough as nails personality to the character, as well as the funny and light hearted side that would make us all laugh. Lane's obsession with Elvis Presley brought a lot of entertaining moments to the show. K Callan and Eddie Jones were outstanding as The Kents. They also had outstanding chemistry between them, and did a very good job supplying the support and love that Clark needed. My only gripe casting wise was Jimmy Olsen. The first season Jimmy was played by Michael Landes, who I felt nailed the role. However, from seasons 2-4 the show's producers wanted an actor that appealed to more of a younger audience and they went with Justin Whalin. While Justin did a good job, I always felt that Michael did a much better job, and should have remained in the cast.
Overall, Lois & Clark is one of the best shows ever made in my opinion. All of the actors involved were unbelieveable, the effects used for Superman's powers were very well done, and the show featured a wonderul mix of action, comedy, and romance that made the show extremely well rounded and enjoyable overall. Ever since Smallville was put on the air, Lois and Clark and Smallville have battled to claim the title of best Superman show. While I highly enjoy Smallville, it will never come close to Lois and Clark in my opinion. If there was ever a show that deserved to be released on DVD, it is Lois and Clark. Frankly I am suprised that season 1 has not already been put out. The show continues to gain fans through reruns in syndication, and even Dean Cain himself has put in a request for the show's release on DVD.",1080518400,6,2814,4.519607843137255

Lois and Clark added to that Superman story by highlighting the story *behind* the story, giving the viewer more than just Superman, but what went into making Superman.  Lois and Clark brought fun, romance, morality, special effects, excitement, and light-hearted banter to the TV.  In the midst of all the reality shows, cop shows, high-tension shows, Lois and Clark is something the whole family can sit down to -- all generations, from my teenage daughter to my 87 yr old mother -- and just have an enjoyable time. Lois and Clark has a large fan base even though the show has been gone for more than 5 years.  A brief check of the fan sites (including the extensive fan fiction sites) would assure you that a DVD release would fare very well.  I look forward to having all 4 seasons of Lois and Clark on DVD!",1064620800,8,1035,4.4787234042553195
2255799,5,B00080ZG2O,This show has it all.  It appeals to all ages.  It is timeless because the message of good always winning over evil is the one constant that we cling to.  The morals Superman protrays are what we all aspire to have.  Please speed up the process of releasing all four seasons on DVD.  We the American people need Superman just as much as Lois and Metropolis do.,1062979200,6,360,4.313432835820896

There was no show I waited more anxiously for its debut than ""Lois & Clark, the New Adventures of Superman"" and the new ""Smallville"".  I want to have the entire DVD collection of ""Lois & Clark""; even today I watch the show on reruns whenever they are on.  I love Dean Cain and buy everything he is in and tape everything else.  There is no more perfect Lois Lane than Teri Hatcher.  I especially liked the fact that Clark and his parents still had a relationship and were a very close family.  Please, please, please put it out on DVD so that Superman fans everywhere will be able to have this collection in their own homes to watch whenever they want.",1062720000,11,838,4.480263157894737

2255804,4,B00080ZG2O,"There definitly needs to be a Lois and Clark series DVD set.  There are so many average and bad shows that are coming out on DVD and it is just a shame that this hasn't come out yet, and this is was a great show.  Lois and Clark was just a great show.  Some of the storylines were a little off and some of the villans after the first two seasons were kind of a stretch, but for the most part, this show was great.  You have Dean Cane who makes a great superman.  The guy looks like superman and hes a very solid actor.  Also, (the biggest reason for Lois and Clark DVD) you have Teri Hatcher who is just amazing and extrememly beutiful.  The woman is great.  Cane and Hatcher have just an excellent on screen precence when they are together.  The show just gives a very cool twist to the superman saga.  I get up everymorning to watch the show on TBS and it would just be beutiful if the show was on a DVD set so it would be at everyone's disposal to watch at any time they want.  At some point, TBS will probably move the show to a different time slot and this will effect many people's ability to view the show.  When this happens, there needs to be a DVD set to ease America's pain of not being able to see the show anymore.  Lois and Clark seasons on DVD needs to happen now.

However, I, (as well as many, many other people I know), would buy this DVD over taping it ANY day. It's a wonderful show, one that cannot be compared to. I never get sick of watching this show, and a DVD would be a good, (and profitable for those who are making it) idea. No Lois and Clark fan will be able to resist buying it. I know I wont! It think it's what's definitely missing from our video-specialty stores. It's probably one of the only big-hit television series without a DVD out already!",1062028800,4,653,4.069767441860465

But in their rush to make some more money out of bad shows corporate executives forget one thing, they could make even more money bringing out top rated shows that are no longer running. Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman of is just such a show. From the very first episode I was hooked on the superhero action with a wink this show provides. Where some tv shows made for children lose appeal when those children have grown up, Lios and Clark keeps interresting in it's use of humor and by not taking itself all to seriously.
This show deserves to be brought out on DVD. As does the still large fan base deserve the reward for all their patience in waiting for so long until it finally is available on DVD.",1061164800,17,780,4.312925170068027

Once TBS cancels the series we will have no way to watch this fantastic show. Dean Cain's portrayal of Clark/Superman gives depth to a character often dismissed as comic fluff.  Terri Hatcher's portrayal of Lois Lane is easily the best work of her career. Let's get involved and get this series on DVD!!!!,1060992000,2,419,4.573333333333333

It took me a while to realize the camp is completely intentional. Some episodes are better than others, but I just love the lead characters and the chemistry between them. The supporting characters are wonderful as well. I wish I could watch it again for the first time!",1509926400,,505,4.326315789473684

8055069,5,B00080ZG2O,"My wife and I always enjoyed this series back when it ran live. Terri Hatcher was an attractive, yet suitably bossy and bitchy Lois Lane, straight out of the mold of the 1978 movie. Dean Cain made a remarkably personable Clark Kent. He has a wonderfully expressive face, and could literally crack us up with the well timed raise of an eyebrow. In addition, Lane Smith nailed Perry White, the demanding and bombastic editor of the Daily Planet.

While the series is dated compared to modern technology, the Superman special effects hold up very well, as does the visual presentation of these shows. They are bright and colorful, and remarkably crisp considering that these are DVDs and we are now spoiled to Blu ray resolution.

The pilot episode does a very nice job of introducing Clark Kent, and displaying some of his powers bit by bit. At this stage he hasn't even decided to become a ""super hero"" ... he's got these awesome powers, but his parents are more worried about him being discovered and spending the rest of his life as a lab subject. A sequence at the end of the pilot where ""Ma Kent"" is sewing a variety of candidate super hero costumes for him to try on is laugh out loud funny. The actors came into the pilot with these characters fully developed in their heads, and the early portrayal of our favorite Metropolis group is not only fulfilling in terms of our expectations for the roles, but is remarkably true to the long term portrayals ... something not always easily accomplished for the early stages of a TV series.

The stories in these episodes are classics that often seem to come right out of the pages of the comic books. These shows are also fun in that Clark Kent has to use his brain fully as much as his brawn (and other powers) to solve the mysteries and problems which confront him.

You can find all of these seasons at bargain prices now, which makes collecting them a no-brainer if you were fans of the series, or the ""Superman set"" in general. One of the bonuses for us is that this series ran before we had a DVR available, so I'm sure we missed a show from time to time which we can pleasantly discover as we go through these seasons.

Highly recommended.",1503360000,,2194,4.516372795969773
