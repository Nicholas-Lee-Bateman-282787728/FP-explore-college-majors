8529610,4,B008QOH1OK,now what I had expected but good anyway.,1455580800,,40,4.125
8529611,1,B008QOH1OK,Really bored me. I like to see actual footage. Stayed in one area too long. Was not impressed with it.,1438560000,,102,4.15
8529612,1,B008QOH1OK,"Not at ALL what I expected, it's audio quality is poor, the video looks like someone did it with a camcorder, you can barely hear what's said, there's no real discussion of the hauntings, just a couple of people talking about the building, I turned it off about 45 mins in, wish I could get a refund on it, and I'm not one to return things typically, don't waste the money, there are much better shows available about the paranormal. I have seen other shows that were ""low budget"" about ghosts that are far far superior in quality and informational value.",1430265600,2,555,4.5049504950495045
8529613,5,B008QOH1OK,great movie,1417824000,,11,5.0
8529614,1,B008QOH1OK,"Not at all what I expected. This is simply a discussion with home owners about what a medium thinks he sees. If you want to be bored to tears, then by all means, this is the dvd for you!",1410912000,5,186,3.7948717948717947
8529615,5,B008QOH1OK,"Lots of footage for your buck! I live for ghost shows, haha...this one was very cool. I started orders shows like these rather than the big Hollywood ones because a lot of those seem sooooo acted. I want to wonder if its real or not, not be certain that its fake! This one made me wonder. Eeriness abounds!",1374969600,7,306,4.293103448275862
8529616,5,B008QOH1OK,Wow! Great dvd. I'm a big fan of all the ghost shows and this is on par with all that stuff if not a little better. They need to make a series of this. I'm so there.,1374710400,5,165,3.4864864864864864
8529617,4,B008QOH1OK,Paranormal research is an awesome area to explore. Especially when you get to do it through the eyes of experts who know what they are doing and have the proper equipment. I have watched this one a few times.,1362614400,4,208,4.358974358974359
