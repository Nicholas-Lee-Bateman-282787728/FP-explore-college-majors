4234880,3,B003ZM81AQ,"Before watching a movie like 2010 MOBY DICK, you have to make sure your expectations are realistic--after all, it IS from The Asylum!
Loosely based on Herman Melville's classic, this update gives us a HUGE whale, predictably hokey FX and unbelievable dialogue.
But what's surprising is Barry Bostwick's over the top Ahab.  Chewing the scenery mercilessly, it's a performance that outshines the material.  The film's ending also foregoes most predictable endings and though rather quick, it's not what I expected.
It won't be a classic but it's entertaining.",1305331200,,557,5.318181818181818
4234881,5,B003ZM81AQ,"First things first: Any movie where the antagonist resembles an enormous shriveled phallus is a winner before it's even out of the gate.  Granted, the acting is three rungs below the craftsmanship one might find on a 10 am Mexican soap-opera, and the special effects are akin to a cardboard cutout of David Hasselhoff, and the writing is a bit less complex than ""Goodnight Moon"", I still think that its strict adherence to Melville's tome is admirable.  I mean, when Captain Ahab loses his prosthetic leg and thus substitutes a wooden grave marker, I nearly wept from the humanity.  If you hate films that diverge from the original novels, if you are a lover of independent cinema or (as the unrefined may say) ""artsy"" films, if you're seeking for a visual masterpiece to compliment that bottle of chardonnay chilling in the fridge, then definitely forgo the mere 3.99 rental and instead spend... nay, INVEST the $17.17 for 2010: Moby Dick, this masterpiece of American cinema.

4234882,2,B003ZM81AQ,"*** Some small spoilers are in this review ***

This movie is an adaptation of Herman Melville's book, and it is almost a good modernization.  I really wanted to like it because it tries hard to be a decent monster movie.  The acting, effects, and camerawork are better than they are in most Asylum movies.  But it fell apart at the end.

The movie had three main flaws that ruined it for me:

(1) Captain Ahab's motivation.  Why did he finally snap?  Did he have cancer or a terminal illness?  Did Moby Dick suddenly begin destroying ships?  Did he finally captain a vessel capable of destroying Moby Dick?  Ahab commands the ""most advanced boat in the Fleet"", so perhaps that last reason is correct.  But waiting forty years for revenge?

(2) The set-up for the last battle is just illogical in too many ways to discuss. Moby Dick has all of the oceans of the world to make a last stand, and he chooses to fight *where*?  And Ahab and his crew fight him in rubber dinghies with small arms?  And then they all die?  Doesn't the Asylum have any ideas on how to set up a battle?  And couldn't Moby Dick have destroyed the Pequod at any time?

(3) The ending is a big cop-out.  We have destruction but no satisfaction.  Another five minutes of falling action, a short voiceover to wrap up the movie, a flash-forward . . . anything is better than watching the credits roll.  Did the scriptwriters just run out of steam?

The movie has some memorable moments.  The blackness of Moby Dick's eyes.  The dual-recognition of the ""absence of sound"" in a sonar scan.  Birds indicating the presence of whales.  Moby Dick eating another whale.  Even the silliness of the last battle has some good moments --- the hiding whale, the crawling whale, etc.  But they all lead to a disappointing ending, and that makes ""Moby Dick"" only a two-star movie.",1301875200,,1835,4.529051987767584

If you liked ""Altitude"" you might be able to tolerate this movie. First let me say I have been on nuclear submarines and the technical aspects of the movie are about zero accurate except for the fact submarines go under water. You can not extend a periscope at 1700 feet (about crush depth for 1969 subs) beneath the water and see anything, let alone take a picture. You cannot poke a periscope through ice, nor can a submarine do a 90 degree up bubble without uncovering the reactor core and immediately going right back down the way they came. They don't then splash on the surface as the Seaview used to do. The list is endless of the gross technological impossibilities.

How did Ahab rise from an enlisted sonar technician to becoming the Captain of the Pequad? I think after losing his leg, he would of had a medical discharge. The movie stars Renee O'Connor (whale scientist) of Xena fame who wears a bikini top in the beginning, sporting her new set of love handles. She manages to do some decent acting amidst a sea of bad actors and stolen lines from the original Moby Dick. Like Supercar, Moby Dick appears to be at home both on land, sea, and in the air. Ahab is obsessed with finding the white whale and goes rogue. Meanwhile the government is hunting Ahab and blaming all the damage done by Moby Dick on him.

4234894,3,B003ZM81AQ,"This review is for the DVD release of 2010: Moby Dick released by The Asylum.

This is probably more of a 2 1/2 star effort but i'm giving it 3 stars because I'm feeling generous today and the first half was pretty good but you forget that when you get to the disappointing finale.

The movie started off well enough. The main problem is the last 20 minutes. It just get's ridiculous at that point.
'Moby Dick' has some decent buildup even if it is preposterous. Obviously they were attempting to follow the book somewhat...except in modern times.
I can live with all the plot holes. I can live with not following naval procedures. I can live with the illogical behavior of the whale. What I can't live with is when you start to tell a story and then never tell it. They realized there was a reason for the whale's behavior and that it was acting illogically, yet they never bother to explain why. We just sort of get to the end and it seems like the director said....f*** it...we are out of money....let's just finish this thing. It was like they wanted to tell the story of 'Moby Dick' but just lost their way.

I'm fine with a 500 ft. whale. Afterall, it is a monster movie. I'm not fine with it jumping around on land. The whale was CGI and it didn't look great but it didn't look terrible either. It could have been worse.
The scenes on the island at the end just killed it for me. I don't know what happened here. It seems as if they just gave up at this point. How exactly did that girl survive after getting blown to smithereens? I guess they had to have somebody live so that they could have a happy ending.

I won't be holding my breath for 2020: Moby Dick.
I'm not sure why I'm giving this 3 stars...it's a lost opportunity. I'd give the first half of the movie 4 stars but the second half 1 star, thus my average of 2 1/2 stars.
Recommended for people who like CGI cheezy monster movies.",1490659200,2,1899,4.281337047353761

The writer had to create a super monster that would never act like a whale. So they made it a combo between a shark and a whale and used recent stories about a humpback whale breaching that took down a small boat. The acting is fairly good a nice combo between the book and Crimson Tide. The problem becomes when they get to an island the story quickly becomes a unreal unstoppable monster against humans movie. It can breach onto land and crawl around can take gun fire and a rocket powered harpoon. Finally they nuke the island, which being so close to Hawaii would cause people to glow in dark and the scientist survives we presume to get cancer later. The whale survives to kill again. This would have been a much better story if they had done it on another planet, it just doesn't work as a modern retelling.",1336521600,,958,4.382022471910112
4234920,2,B003ZM81AQ,"I'm assuming they shot the script they had.  If that's the case, then the script is a perversion to behold, so wrong on so many different levels.  It's literally as if a 7-year-old heard about a classic book called MOBY DICK and was asked to tell his version of it.

I didn't think that special effects would one day be worse than the Godzilla & Friends from the Japan I grew up on.  But CGI is proving to be worse than a man in a rubber suit destroyed a Lego town as firecrackers go off.

There are scenes in 2010: MOBY DICK that make GODZILLA look like JURASSIC PARK.  And action so bad that it's nearly great in being so bad: the great white whale at one point chases soldiers up onto a beach.  When we next see the whale, it is leaping from a cliff overhead to attack another band of soldiers before scurrying back into the sea.

This is a script that twists into impossible contortions to have a scarred Naval submarine commander quote Captain Ahab from Melville's original novel.

Scenes are lifted from many other movies, so are stock characters.  Things happen because...well...this is how things happen in movies.  For example, two torpedoes plow toward an island.  Not a little island.  A big island with trees and cliffs and stuff.  The lead actress, a spunky scientist, is not about to go down without trying to escape and runs across the island.  Torpedoes hit.  Apocalyptic fireball engulfs the entire island.  Next shot, the island is GONE.  Not one pebble breaking the surface, and the ocean is surprisingly calm.  Girls breaks surface.  Unharmed.  THAT's what I mean: things happen, movie things, and reality is insulted.

""2010: Moby Dick"" is a modernized version of a Herman Melville classic produced by The Asylum, an American film company and distributor that has made such films as ""Snakes on the Train"" ""Transmorphers"" and ""Paranormal Entity."" The direct-to-DVD production follows the story of Ahab, who was severely injured while on board the USS Acushnet back in 1969. And the submarine was attacked by a white whale called Moby Dick.

Cue to the present day. A marine biologist Dr. Michelle Herman (Rene O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) reluctantly join the Pequod, a US submarine under the command of vengeful Captain Ahab (Barry Bostwick). He and the submarine crew are after the mysterious whale Moby Dick that has attacked several ships and an offshore rig.

4234926,4,B003ZM81AQ,"Whenever my faith in The Asylum begins to waver, a movie like 2010: Moby Dick comes along to remind me why I am, in all probability, the world's most unabashed admirer of this film company's low-budget wares.  I'm certainly not saying this modern cinematic adaptation is going to supplant Herman Melville's epic masterpiece of literature, nor am I nominating it for any ""best of"" film awards.  What I am saying is that 2010: Moby Dick is just great fun to watch.  So what if Moby Dick could never be easily mistaken for an actual whale?  Heck fire, Moby Dick has always been - more than anything else - a metaphor for any number of things dreamed up by literary critics.  The same can be said of Ahab and his mad quest to exact his revenge on the great whale.  This movie, in my opinion, actually manages to explore some of the same themes as the original novel - it doesn't get very far or do it all that well, but I was surprised just to see the effort made along those lines.

For all of its fakeness, Moby Dick is really a sight to behold - over six hundred feet long, battle-scarred, and bristling with the remains of dozens of harpoons over the years.  Even a military submarine is no match for this beast of the sea - and that gets us to Ahab.  Having seen the whale first-hand back in 1969 and blaming him for the loss of his leg, this young navy man overcame his physical handicap (and the fact that he is pretty much insane) to rise to the command of a nuclear submarine in today's American fleet - a submarine he personally refortified and redesigned as the final step in his master plan to hunt down and kill the whale that took his leg.  Now he's gone rogue, telling his crew that he has orders to hunt down Moby Dick and boat-napping ""whale language"" expert Dr. Michelle Herman (Renee O'Connor) to help him track down the beast.  The Navy doesn't take kindly to a madman with stripes leaving the reservation with a nuclear submarine, leaving Ahab little time to find the whale before the Navy finds him.  Modern-day versions of Queequeg, Starbuck, and Stub are just along for the ride.

I actually liked the ending, even though it's the type of ending that most viewers will find incomplete and disappointing, and there are some great moments along the way.  It's great fun to watch Captain Ahab (Barry Bostwick) stomp around (with his artificial leg) and chew up the scenery as he proclaims the deadly menace of Moby Dick, and the whale has some pretty good scenes as he basically toys with the man he knows to be his mortal enemy.  There's even one point where the whale surfaces purely in order to laugh at Ahab's latest failure.  That, to me, is entertainment.",1317513600,,2678,4.479423868312757

4234929,1,B003ZM81AQ,"A loose remake of Moby Dick and absolutely ridiculous from start to finish.  Barry Bostwick is now Captain Ahab Captain of the finest of America's submarine fleet, the ""Peaquad"" Bostwick ""Ahabs"" around with enough ham for Easter dinner with enough left over for sandwiches.  It's pretty silly having the murderous whale being chased by a submarine instead of a rickety, beaten down boat.  To compensate they make the whale ten times bigger but the CGI effects are so soggy that Moby looks like a giant, white turd with teeth. As expected Moby eats the rest of Ahab that he had missed before.  Apparently Moby Dick is partial to ham.

But my question is where was Ishmael?  Unless Ishmael was supposed to be the bikini clad scientist who is ""requested"" to join Ahab and his merry band of whale chasers.

A total waste of time but what can you expect from The Asylum whose movies always smell a little fishy?",1308441600,3,906,4.660377358490566

I gave it three stars because some of the crew believed in what they were doing.  It was OK... definitely not the best movie ever.  But, again definitely not the worst I have ever seen.  So if you do not need to count on the greatest cinema photography, lines and acting take a chance and watch it.  You may enjoy it... and you may not.

If you love cheesy B movies, then this one is absolutely on the must see list!  I really like the cheesy B movies with big name actors from the past.  Why?  Because they are FUN to watch!  This movie is absolutely fun.  If you are looking for a serious take on a Moby Dick remake, look elsewhere.  This isn't it.  It seems this was meant to be cheesy from the start and I loved every gooey moment.",1527465600,,516,4.141414141414141
