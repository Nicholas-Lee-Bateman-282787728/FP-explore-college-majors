8225058,5,B000WPGVGA,"This is surprisingly very good and spooky.  The host is a historian and a great story teller.  He tells of urban legends and haunted roads, houses and cemetaries in Ohio.  A lot of fun.  I'm very glad I purchased this.  Turn the lights down and picture youself in front of a campfire - and listen to the chilling tales of faceless phantoms and drowned spirits trying to gain access to a home - and the Hook Man!  Great stuff!  His narratives of his own personal experiences with haunted roads are the most chilling.  Very informative and definitely not boring!",1318032000,,560,4.585858585858586
8225059,5,B000WPGVGA,Great stories on this DVD. The historian is telling them and you get to see a lot of the places where these spooky stories came from! Definitely creeped out ... I live near some of these places. Lots of variety and I was left wanting more!,1284508800,,239,4.217391304347826
8225060,5,B000WPGVGA,True ghost stories from Ohio with Richard Crawford is a creepy journey into serious local ghost stories.  What makes it genuinely unsettling or spooky is that the host is a historian which gives an authenticity to the ghost stories.  The music combined with the cinematography and on-site footage makes for a different experience found with generic Hollywood documentaries.,1271808000,,373,5.413793103448276

8225062,4,B000WPGVGA,This dvd was very entertaining in it's story telling.  It made me want to go to some of the sites.  (and I did).  These are some great ghost stories and my favorite is the faceless hitchhiker.  It's been a legend I've heard about since I was a kid but never knew where to find it.,1252627200,,280,4.036363636363636
