4082491,5,B0037X5BME,I bought this Dvd for my father and he loved it. I went home to watch it with him and I must admit the camera stills are stunning. If you are a humming bird enthusiast I would highly recommend this product.,1279411200,38,206,4.048780487804878
4082492,5,B0037X5BME,"My wife and I love hummingbirds!  We have three kinds that visit our feeders, Anna's, Black-chinned and Rufous. They are a joy to watch. Until we watched this video, some of their behavior was a mystery to us. We had assumed we were watching territorial disputes between the males and courting between the male and females. We were right! This video captures some amazing footage of hummingbirds doing some amazing things.  There are scenes of hummingbirds in their natural habitat and in gardens.  There is one scene in particular of many, many hummingbirds in one garden feeding that you've got to see. I wish the video was longer but based on the Behind the Scenes featurette, it was difficult to make.
My one and only gripe about this video is the ridiculous assumptions of how the THEORY of evolution influenced these beautiful creatures in their behavior and development.  There is no question that micro-evolution exists but the kind of evolution that is discussed in this video is absurd. At any rate, this doesn't ruin the video at all and it's just my opinion. For any hummingbird lover or anyone interested in birds, this is a FANTASTIC video!",1275609600,48,1154,4.842639593908629
4082493,5,B0037X5BME,"If folk like ""March of the Penguins,"" then they should like this work on a different type of bird.  The work says hummingbirds only live in this hemisphere, but they film in diverse locations (the Andes, SF, Louisiana, etc.) to film the 300-plus types.  The work shows scientists studying hummingbirds using new video technology and this shows that we have much more to learn on this species.  At one point, two researchers use a live female hummingbird and a dead one to lure in a male hummingbird.  I understand why they did it?  Perhaps the animals are too smart to be deceived by a dead one.  But could you imagine a living man walking up to a woman in order to flirt and then learning that she's dead!?  For those who love baby animals, the work eventually shows eggs, nests, and hatchlings.  I loved seeing the symbiotic relationship between these birds and flowers, but I was wondering about how man's destruction of such plants and habitats would affect these birds since the start of the work.  The work only mentions endangerment near the end and they focus on an example in which humans are trying to fight the tragedy.  Thus, this work gives a positive spin that perhaps its audience wants to hear.  I also imagine that gardeners would enjoy this documentary too.",1267660800,9,1275,4.672645739910314

4082506,5,B0037X5BME,"I might have enjoyed more a show that was a visual essay on hummingbirds and had less human presence in it.  This show, to a great degree, is a show about scientific research being done on hummingbirds.  And, while the hummingbirds are not really treated inhumanely, some of the research using captive hummingbirds is a bit uncomfortable to watch.  You should approach this show more as an educational scientific show than as a tribute to the beauty of hummingbirds.  But if you are prepared for that, it is an absolutely fascinating show, and any show that contains hummingbirds cannot help but be beautiful as well.",1418428800,4,617,4.847619047619047

4082541,4,B0037X5BME,"""Hummingbirds: Magic in the Air"" gets four stars for the quite spectacular footage of these small jewels of the avian world. Many of the hummingbirds featured are very, very strange!

My favourite is the species living high in the mountains, where the air is too thin for the bird to hover - which doesn't matter, since all flowers are within reach on the ground. Another classic is the hummingbird who nests close to hawks' nests, since hawks love to eat animals that prey on hummingbird nests. And how many people realize that swifts are evolutionary cousins of hummingbirds? The most spectacular part of the documentary shows the mating ritual of the rare spatuletail, endemic to a small region of Peru.

That being said, I nevertheless get the impression that this documentary is more about nerdy ornithologists doing research on hummingbirds, than about the birds themselves...

But sure, if ""hummers"" are your first love, this might just indulge you.",1374969600,,956,5.037974683544304

4082543,3,B0037X5BME,"This dvd about hummingbirds has spectacular video, including fascinating slow-motion segments of these amazing creatures.  This ""Nature"" channel product keeps the viewer engaged with flight facts and observations of unique behavior.  However, the injection of Evolution beliefs as fact is annoying, and increases as the dvd goes on.

If someone can believe that hummingbirds ""evolved,"" I suppose that believer could believe anything Evolutionists tell them.
The narrator is not even consistent.  Sometimes he says ""designed"" and sometimes he says ""evolved.""  If a living thing was designed, there had to be a Designer.  That is a simple fact.

Something about the theory of Evolution I would love to have explained is; If a change in a living thing takes millions of years to effect, how can the change be a true ""need""?  If that species can survive for those million (+) years, why was the change needful?  Obviously, by definition, a change cannot be a ""need"" if creature after creature comes to life, lives and reproduces successfully.

The slow motions really show how the birds acheive what they do. Lots of birds included that you don't encounter in USA. And not enough of the ones that are here for my taste.

Although they virtually dissappear during the maiting and hatching season, they come back to visit with us for the rest of the summer.

It helps us to better understand the life of our little friends.",1320019200,14,472,4.436781609195402
4082571,5,B0037X5BME,Isaw this video initially as a program on PBS Nature. Every parent should make their children sit down and watch Nature. Drag them away from their X Boxes. I unfortunately caught only the last twenty minutes of the hour long show. I am a birdwatcher and a hummingbird enthusiast so I am delighted to have the video. It is wonderful in showing all the outstanding feats these little giants are capable of doing.,1319328000,,410,4.63013698630137

4082580,5,B0037X5BME,"""Extraordinary Birds"" is a new collection from Nature (PBS) that highlights the unexpected, unimaginable, diversity of the avian world.  Over six hours of award-winning programs includes: ""The Wild Side of Paradise,"" ""Raptor Force,"" ""American Eagle,"" ""Pale Male,"" ""Birds"" and ""Hummingbirds.""  All are incredible nature films of great beauty with superlative images, but the real treasure is the simultaneous release of the Blu-ray edition of ""Hummingbirds: Magic In The Air.""

Seeing hummingbirds captured at 500 frames per second is a trigger that evokes wonder.  These birds, the smallest warm-blooded creatures on our shared planet are also among the fastest.  Their wings beat up to 200 times a second!  Try flapping your arms as fast as you can and you'll be lucky to get three flaps per second!  Most of the fascinating world of these fragile creatures is beyond the perception of human eyes.  But now, with high-speed cameras that world can now be seen.  We witness their deadly predatory pursuits and their elaborate mating routines and rituals including aerial displays of nose dives that subject them to ten G's of force!  Read that again.  That's enough to cause a military-trained jet pilot to black out!

If you appreciate nature as a source of delight and awe, this never-before-seen collection of stunning images is one to own.  Academy Award winner F. Murray Abraham does the exemplary narration.  From Questar.  Blu-ray.",1300320000,2,1437,5.241228070175438
