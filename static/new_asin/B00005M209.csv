1623931,2,B00005M209,"Here's an example of Lucio Fulci at his worst. Just so you know right up front, this film is actually pasted together from bits out of other movies! The story tells of a troubled film director who finds that the gory scenes he creates in his movies seem to be acted out in real life. Is he going mad or is there some supernatural element at work? If you waste your time watching this, the chances are you won't even care.

To make up most of the running time, unrelated and disparate scenes of gore and murder have been spliced in from several of Fulci's other films made at around this time. For this reason, the film appears to make no sense at all. It's like some very lazy clips show. All the films that the clips are taken from were unsuccessful on release...maybe they thought nobody would notice! There's no attempt made to help the viewer identify which scenes are real and which are fantasy. And although in some movies that works very well (""Images"" is a good example), you have to be a very skilled director to pull it off, but Fulci is not capable of building any kind of atmosphere except one of confusion. He also takes the lead role as the troubled director..sadly his acting skills are nothing to write home about either.

Only appealing to absolute hard-core Fulci enthusiasts, this movie is an insult to any serious or even casual horror buff. Save your money and give this a wide berth.",1237248000,3,1405,4.484375
1623932,5,B00005M209,"Maybe one of the most bizarre horror-comedies ever made. If you're a fan of 'the master' are will be delighted my this extremely violent, yet funny film.",1235088000,3,153,4.703703703703703
1623933,3,B00005M209,"I like Lucio Fulci but don't think he's a genre god like some fans do, so I kind of enjoyed Cat in the Brain.  It's sort of a comedic 8 1/2 with Fulci playing himself and doing a pretty decent job of it.  The plot is completely silly and most of the gore spliced in from other Fulci movies, so it's obvious he wasn't taking this very seriously.  This DVD should be a must-have for Fulci completists who own the Region 2 full-frame version.  The extras alone are worth the upgrade.  A good film?  Nah!  A fun trifle?  Definitely.",1234483200,4,528,4.262626262626263
1623934,1,B00005M209,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've seen most of Fulci's other works (which range from mediocre to zero degrees Kelvin). I have never understood the cult of Fulci, as he has made some of the worst films ever made.  This film is a prime example.  Filled with bad acting, bad dubbing, cheesy gore, a stupid story, continuity flubs, and just overall bad craftmanship, it was a chore to sit through this one.  It isn't surprising that many current American horror filmmakers cite Fulci as an influence, as their work is reminiscent of his: sloppy, badly written, badly directed, and just, well, BAD.  In some of Fulci's earlier films (like The Beyond, House by the Cemetary and City of the Living Dead), there's a really visceral gore scene, a decent camera move, and/or a really strange, surreal ending.  I do believe the endings of both The Beyond and House by the Cemetary are surreal and strange purposely, but in Cat in the Brain, there's none of that.  Fulci's performance isn't that bad (he always had a cameo in his films, and was always good), but overall this film is his worst, and that's saying something.  Some will swear he's a genius; I'm not one of them.",1234396800,5,1188,4.5754716981132075

1623936,2,B00005M209,"Cheesy music, poor dubbing, glaring continuity errors, dodgy acting (not the least from Fulci himself) and buckets of often less-than-convincing gore. Even the cat looks ridiculously fake!

What was Fulci thinking of? If intended as a (cat got yer-)tongue-in-cheek satirical comment, it should have been sharper and wittier. If intended as grand guignol horror, it should have been darker and more menacing.

Just about saved from being a lone-star movie by the interest value of seeing Fulci himself and the variety of butchery just may melt the hardened gore-fan's butter.

On the whole very disappointing though.",1175299200,5,615,5.385416666666667
1623937,4,B00005M209,"I can see why ""Cat in the Brain"" is so expensive at Amazon - it was released about 17 years ago and still hasn't got a decent DVD re-release by Anchor Bay or whoever. And that's a mystery to me because it's one of the greatest Lucio Fulci films. Certainly it's not like his classic works of the late 70s and early 80s, nothing like ""The Beyond"", ""The New-York Ripper"" or ""House by the Cemetery"". But it still delivers the usual Fulci goods. The director plays himself - a horror movie-director who's being stalked by some lunatic and meanwhile suffers from brutal and bizarre hallucinations.
Although the film has rather an ambiguous plot and multiple meanings, it still remains an exploitation feature like many others of Lucio Fulci. And you may search those meanings recalling Oscar Wilde's quote about life imitating art, but still... ""Cat in the Brain"" is interesting primarily because of its cheesy content.
I remember watching this film in the beginning of the 90s on VHS and I was pretty amazed about how much it was unlike most of the usual American slashers and chillers. ""Cat in the Brain"" started with a guy chainsawing a naked woman lying on the table, then hashing her parts in a meat-grinder and finally feeding the mincemeat to the cats. I couldn't recall any other movie that was as much explicit and graphic. And all this stuff were made with a master shot, all the details of the woman's anatomy and chainsawing quite visible.
So if you enjoy this kind of violent cinema, you'll definately like this one - and it's full of likes of the above-mentioned scene, stabbing, gore, Nazi-uniform orgies etc. What else can attract exploitation films' lovers? And if you like previous Fulci's works, I'm sure you'll like ""Cat on the Brain"" too. You can still see Maestro's hand here, it's just that Lucio achieved some new level with this film. A new level of brutality maybe or a new level of sense - it's for you to decide.
And I still hope we'll see a nice DVD release of this outstanding movie.",1153699200,3,2007,4.656338028169014
1623938,1,B00005M209,"As one who often paid good coin to see Fulci movies during their brief theatrical runs, I can appreciate the guilty pleasure of kicking back to hoot at badly-dubbed sadism and cheesy gore. But I draw the line at clods who insist that Lucio Fulci was some kind of tortured, misunderstood artist. Better you should write theses on the mise-en-scene of AIRPORT 1975, or maybe the underlying theme of ROLLER BOOGIE. There's no doubt Fulci was intending to shock his audience with mean-spirited viciousness; however, his ham-handed obviousness and ineptitude are what make his films ""classics"". I haven't seen BEATRICE CENCI or that DUCKLING one, so maybe there was some real talent there once. But from ZOMBIE onward, Fulci delivered more unintentional comedy than on-purpose terror. CAT IN THE BRAIN is probably his worst ever, a hopeless porridge of old gore-fx footage spliced into new scenes in an excruciating attempt at a psychological thriller. A horror-film director slowly losing his ability to distinguish reality from fantasy IS a scenario ripe with possibilities: wait till you see how badly this simple-yet-solid premise is botched. Or better yet, take my word for it and pass altogether. I hold no personal animus against the late Fulci, but it irritates me no end that this guy is slowly gaining a reputation as some kind of great Italian moviemaker - mostly from lazy gorehounds who can't be bothered to check out De Sica, Rossellini, Visconti or legit horror masters like Bava and Freda. Maybe CAT IN THE BRAIN isn't representative of Fulci's best -he was in failing health at the time- but I've seen his other ""triumphs"" and his only genius was in aiming low - and missing.",998697600,17,1687,4.964664310954063
1623939,3,B00005M209,"I'll begin this review by warning everybody that it will only focus on the content of the film, not the DVD itself (which is still 2 months from release at the time of this review).  This being an Image Entertainment release though, I feel safe in my assumption that the sound and video quality will be at least acceptable.
This is in a way Fulci's autobiography.  Fulci on Fulci if you will. A look (sort of) into the mind of one of the Italian Cinema's most controversial and prolific filmmakers, at least that was the idea.  This movie can only be taken on one level, gore munching fun.  Unfortunately all of the potential of a poignant look into the mind of the maestro is absolutely wasted, and what's left is a somewhat 2 dimensional story. A director of violent movies (Lucio Fulci) tries to cure himself of all the mental anguish having created such pieces of horror celluloid bestows upon him. In his hunt for absolution, he finds himself in the office of one of the most ludicrously acted doctors this side of Brian Yuzna's The Dentist, who takes it upon himself to live out every murderous fantasy he's ever had and pin the wrap on Fulci.
This idea in itself would have still made for an interesting movie, if not an incredibly deep one, but as anybody interested in this movie probably already knows, only around of half of the movie is actually a new film. Most of Cat in the Brain (or Nightmare Concert as it is also commonly known) plays as sort of a Fulci's greatest hits, being made up of gory highlights from many of his lesser known latter films (and a few movies that he didn't actually direct).  It's not unlike, if Lucio's career had been a television series, this would be his end of the 5th season ""flash back episode"".
Even though many have taken issue with the somewhat plaguristic leanings of this movie, the idea itself still kind of works. The problem is the execution is such that the viewer's head is left absolutely spinning. The film cuts from story, to random gore, to story and back again, allowing the film to get to the point where even the most rabid of gore hounds will be tapping his foot and wondering ""When is the blood gonna stop, and the film gonna start again?""
Interestingly enough, through all of this mayhem, Fulci proves to not be all that bad of an actor (his 8,000,000 Hitchokian cameos more than likely got him ready for the role), but unfortunately for the film, he is the only one who appears very fit for the screen.
This film will more than likely only be truly enjoyed by Fulci (or eurohorror) enthusiasts, and while others might enjoy it, they probably won't be able to sit through repeated viewings. But if you are an admirer of the late maestro's work, then there is no reason to not own this ""ode to himself"".  And besides, where else but in a movie made by Fulci, about Fulci would we see multiple Italian beauties swooning ""Look, it's the director Lucio Fulci, maybe I can be in his next movie.""  From the sound of it, she probably has never seen what most often happens to girls in Fulci's movies.",993254400,13,3061,4.504504504504505
1623950,3,B00005M209,"Caught this at The Alamo movie house a week ago when they had their special screenings with a friend who is a huge Fulci fan.  To me, his movies are hit and miss.  The Beyond is probably my favorite of his.  They said the presentation was the new hi-def scan.  The movie was ok but the picture at times was blurry and not cleaned up well.  It wasn't the projector or lighting, one of the Alamo guys said that the original source scan material was in bad shape.  But, if you are a Fulci fan and love Cat in the Brain it's probably the best it ever looked and it is totally uncut.  Lots of gore, T&A and a weird story behind it all.  I'll still buy this Blu-ray package and give it another shot though.",1467676800,2,700,4.095588235294118

The only real genre I watch is horror and this movie would be in my top 50 as worst horror movie, ever. Slow as hell to top it off. Want a good chop em movie? Rent the Hatchet series.

1623952,5,B00005M209,"This horror film, directed, co-scripted and starring the late Lucio Fulci, is about 85% recycled footage from other late-80's Fulci-directed or produced films, but is still interesting nonetheless. Fulci plays a bastardized version of himself, a horror film director named ""Lucio Fulci"", who becomes unhinged when he is unable to differentiate the gory violence in his films with real life. Fulci goes to a psychiatrist, Professor Egon Schwarz (David L. Thompson), to discuss his problem (The Professor's receptionist recognizes him and calls up a friend, telling her that she hopes he gives her a part in his next horror film!) and the Professor tells him that his mind is breaking down the boundaries between fantasy and reality. Fulci goes to the set (at the real Cinecitta Studios in Rome) of his newest flick, a Nazi horror film, and finds a documentary crew waiting to make a film on his life and movies. He loses it and attacks the documentary crew and nearly rapes the female interviewer while in some kind of trance (He apologizes to the woman and she says, ""I really never had such a thrill in my life!""). Professor Schwarz watches all of Fulci's films (as research) and hypnotizes Fulci to ""curb this tendency you have to pass over the boundaries between reality and fantasy"". It turns out that the Professor is actually the madman, though. He conditions Fulci (with an electronic bell tone) to believe that he is responsible for a series of brutal murders that are happening in the area, when it is, in fact, the Professor committing them. We watch the psychopathic Professor cut off some poor woman's fingers with a switchblade and then cut her head off with an axe while making Fulci believe he is actually responsible. As Fulci sinks deeper and deeper into paranoia (his producer, Filipio [Shillet Angel], is forced to shoot scenes of the new horror film by himself), we learn the reason why the Professor is murdering all these people: His unfaithful wife, Katya (Melissa Longo), flaunts her affairs in front of her husband and killing other women (and a few men) is his way of dealing with it. He uses Fulci's films as blueprints for his murders, as if to say violent films cause violence in real-life (He says that same exact thing out loud at one point in the film, only in a sarcastic manner). Thankfully, Fulci has a police inspector (Jeoffrey Kennedy) following his every move and catches the Professor trying to set Fulci up. The cops kill the Professor and Fulci sails away (with the Professor's receptionist!) on his sailboat (named ""Perversion""). A sound of a chainsaw below deck proves that Fulci is not as innocent as we are led to believe. Or is he?  One gets the feeling when watching this film that Fulci was trying to tell his financial backers and fans that he was burned-out and tired of making gore films and it comes across loud and clear. While this film is gory as hell, Fulci uses the blood as a means of demeaning the horror genre rather than to defend it. Fulci was quite capable of making good films in many genres, from giallo (PERVERSION STORY - 1969; LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN - 1971; DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING - 1972), sex comedies (THE EROTICIST - 1972), family films based on Jack London novels (WHITE FANG - 1973; CHALLENGE TO WHITE FANG - 1974), supernatural thrillers (THE PSYCHIC - 1977), crime (CONTRABAND - 1980), sword & sorcery (CONQUEST - 1983), post-apocalypse sci-fi (THE NEW GLADIATORS - 1984), erotic thrillers (THE DEVIL'S HONEY - 1986) and even Westerns (MASSACRE TIME - a.k.a. THE BRUTE AND THE BEASTS - 1966; FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE - 1975; SILVER SADDLE - 1978), but since his gore films, like ZOMBIE (1979), THE GATES OF HELL (a.k.a CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD - 1980), THE BEYOND (1981), THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY (1981) and NEW YORK RIPPER (1982) proved to be his most popular and financially successful (Even if he did turn out the occasional cropper, like THE BLACK CAT - 1980; MANHATTAN BABY - 1982 and AENIGMA - 1987), the only films he could really direct in the latter half of the 80's and early 90's were horror and gore flicks (HANSEL E GRETEL - 1990 [he was uncredited co-director]; DEMONIA - 1990; VOICES FROM BEYOND - 1991; DOOR INTO SILENCE - 1991; Fulci's last directorial film) and even the occasional Italian TV Movie (HOUSE OF CLOCKS - 1989; SWEET HOUSE OF HORRORS - 1989) and this semi-autobiographical film speaks volumes on how he was feeling at the time. A CAT IN THE BRAIN is a very apt title (and, yes, you do see [puppet] cats munching on a brain) to how Fulci must have felt. To have your entire career reduced to nothing but gore-filled horror films after a lifetime in the business must have been truly disappointing to Fulci, yet for all his disappointment, he still manages to ladle on the blood, as we witness a woman being dismembered with a chainsaw, various stabbings, beheadings and impalements, cannibalism and a juicy sequence where Fulci repeatedly runs over a man in his car. None of these scenes were original. They were all lifted from films like Fulci's TOUCH OF DEATH (1988; featuring Brett Halsey and Ria De Simone) and SODOMA'S GHOST (1988; featuring Robert Egon); Andrea Bianchi's MASSACRE (1989); Mario Bianchi's THE MURDER SECRET (1989) and several others. A CAT IN THE BRAIN should please two types of horror fans: Those looking just for the gross-out (including a child in a wheelchair getting beheaded with a chainsaw) and those looking for a little subtext to go along with the blood. I get what Fulci was trying to achieve here and I couldn't agree with him more. Fulci does quite nicely playing himself (It's not as easy as it seems!) and the cast also includes Judy Morrow as the receptionist (who gets her wish), Layla Frank, Georgia Moore, Paul Muller and Marco Di Stefano. Also known as NIGHTMARE CONCERT. Originally released on laserdisc by Box Office Spectaculars and available on DVD from Image Entertainment as part of their ""EuroShock Collection"". Also released on 2 Disc Deluxe Edition DVD from Grindhouse Releasing, the preferred method of watching this film. Not Rated.",1423526400,9,6095,4.782732447817837
1623953,2,B00005M209,"One of Lucio Fulci's oddest films.  Fulci plays himself, a horror director shooting a grisly movie.  Unfortunately the violence from the  movie starts bleeding into his real life, driving him crazy.  He goes to see a psychiatrist who is driven completely mad after watching all of Fulci's movies and becomes a real life maniac like those in Fulci's movies, hypnotizing Fulci so he will think himself the murderer.

It's hard to tell exactly what Fulci was attempting with this one--was he trying to be all meta and clever and make his own 8 1/2 or maybe he was just trying to have a little fun at his own expense.  Whatever it was Fulci was trying to do he doesn't really succeed--Cat in the Brain is an extremely disjointed mess that as often as not feels like Fulci re-purposing deleted scenes and effects from earlier movies and linking it all together with the flimsy meta story.

Still, hard-core Lucio Fulci fans will likely get more of a kick out of this than I did.  It's certainly more playful than the usual Fulci flick and it might feature more over the top gore than all of his previous films put together.  Brett Halsey also has an amusing cameo as the leading man in the movie within the movie.  But if you're not already a fan you should stay away from this one and stick to one of his classic horror movies like The Beyond or City of the Living Dead or House By the Cemetary instead.",1416441600,,1399,4.47244094488189

1623957,4,B00005M209,"I finally caught up to this release after a few years purchasing it.  Mostly all of Director Lucio Fulci's  genre films have been released onto DVD except his wonderfully erotic 'THE DEVIL'S HONEY' aka 'DANGEROUS OBSESSION' aka 'IL MIELE DEL DIAVOLO'-1986 and his early comedies. 'CAT IN THE BRAIN' aka 'NIGHTMARE CONCERT' aka 'UN GATTO NEL CERVELLO'-1990 should only be purchased by viewers who are familiar or who have seen at least his classic titles because the film emerges as a catharsis on film making and his own personal journey in keeping up with them so first time viewers may scratch their heads in befuddlement or appalled by its graphic cartoon-like sequences. It's not one of my favorites as its constructed using clips from other films Fulci was involved in and seems to get lost in its mantric presentation of the director's supposed state of mind although many of his messages do penetrate through it all.  You have probably read all of the reviews included here but not many have commented on the superb presentation by Box Office Spectaculars of the film and its second disc of superb extras.  Not only is the film presented in a clear transfer so you can throw away your bootleg copies but disc one also includes 20 minutes of footage from Fangoria magazines 1996 Weekend of Horrors where Fulci finally got his due.  Looking very frail and obviously put off by the stupidity of the questions asked of him, Fulci would pass away shortly after this appearance which makes it more poignant.  Disc two continues with two excellent 40 minute interviews with the maestro : Genre terrorist in which he discusses the thriller and horror genres and the television years where he gives an excellent account of the Italian film industry in the late fifties and early sixties.  Its like spending over an hour in your screening room getting to know this underrated artist.  Included also is a 45 minute interview with actor Brett Halsey who discusses his film career in Hollywood and Europe with an incredible amount of stories and his work with Fulci.  Rounding out the rest of the disc are written bios and filmographies of Fulci and Halsey, an Italian and US trailer for the film, posters and stills galleries , 3 short remembrances of Fulci by actors Jeoffrey Kennedy, Sacha Maria Darwin and Malisa Longo which seem to be culled from the DVD tribute 'PAURA-LUCIO FULCI REMEMBERED'-2008, and 14 trailers to other sleazy grindhouse forays.  All in all, its worth the price tag and a must for Fulci fans.",1345593600,2,2513,4.836829836829837
1623958,1,B00005M209,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I want to say that first before I give mine.
  This movie is sick. It's downright beyond insane. The gore in this movie is so graphic, elaborate, drawn out and detailed it's horrifying. I am a horror movie fan myself, but this is... phew. There is something called morality, humanity, sanity, and being reasonable. I've seen the trailer of it, read about it, and after that decided to brace myself and watch the piano scene. That did it. Most movies I can watch in full, but not this one. I couldn't continue watching something so evil. I've never been so horrified or shaken up by a film in my life. To think that people, actual PEOPLE, thought the plot up for this honestly worries me. I didn't know the depths of one's mind could go that far down in depravity. I'm surprised it was allowed to even be made. Wow. Dogs & pigs eating organs? Ripping out someone's organs by a chainsaw? I mean COME ON! I'm sorry, but that is beyond, and I mean BEYOND... I can't even think of a word to describe how SICK this movie is.",1337904000,2,1061,4.380710659898477
1623959,3,B00005M209,"Of all the Fulci films ever made, perhaps his opus Cat In The Brain has received the most mixed reviews. Needless to say, it's not his greatest masterpiece but certainly not a waste of your precious time either. Fans of the late Fulci will not be able to sleep until they've witnessed the bloody atrocities nor until they have this DVD within their grasp. After all, it's a Grindhouse release & anyone who knows anything about Grindhouse will tell you they dont' do anything half ass. Cannibal Holocaust, anyone?

Perhaps Fulci is best remembered for his blood-soaked horror epics in the eighties & his widely acclaimed zombie flicks so we simply cannot envision anything such as Cat.  Even so, the maestro doesn't disappoint us but rather takes a completely different approach to the horror genre which could very well be his most ambitious work ever if you can imagine that. If nothing else, let this film serve as a good final film from our beloved director & call it a day. Hell, the extras alone on this baby are worth the cost you will invest in this special edition & the first 2,500 copies are limited edition copies that include a lenticular cover which hardcore enthusiasts will no doubt shell out their hard earned cash for.

Cat is a fairly fun flick for what it is. It's darkly humorous, ultra-gory, & really does make it's audience think about the horror film-making industry as a whole. While Fulci could've milked the whole concept of paranoia regarding video nasties in the late eighties or nineties a bit more, he tosses that card in pursuit of a more bizarre comedy with a twist of nostalgia & plenty of the red stuff. Lucio actually plays himself in this partciluar film as a horror film director (who would've thunk?) that seems to be either burnt out in the process of his craft or a tad bit disillusioned if you will. Have these films caused him to lose touch with reality & could he capable of murdering people in real life?

Unable to cope with the violent images in his head which stem from making one too many gruesome flicks, Fulci decides to visit a psychoanalyst in hopes of a cure. Throughout the course of his visits, the viewer immediately suspects something may not be so kosher about the doctor & soon things begin to spiral out of control. Unbeknownst to Fulci, the psychiatrist is a psychopath who wishes to use Fulci's mental breakdown to his advantage with the grand intention of framing our director for these crimes. Heh.

While Fulci was accused of simply using a great deal of footage from the archives of his older works, Cat InThe Brain is not just a copy & paste job by any means & the scenes are actually well-integrated into the overall story.  Yes, Fulci addicts will recognize some montages from some of the lesser known vehicles as well as Bianchi's Massacre (which I can't seem to find anywhere online as of right now).  Having said that, this could naturally deter some potential viewers although most Americans are not well versed when it comes to international horror flicks & will more than likely overlook this.

Most of us will either love or hate Cat In The Brain but I'm riding the fence for right now. I can definitely appreciate the artistry as always with anything Lucio makes but this wasn't my all-time favorite film even though it's doubtful that I'll ever get rid of it. Cat In The Brain will perhaps grow on me over a period of time & I'm hoping the film gets better with repeated viewings although I've only watched it twice since my purchase on 03/31/2009. Somehow, I believe this one would've really been a lot better had I never seen a Fulci film & had nothing to cross reference. Sadly, I was a bit spolied with films like The New York Ripper & of course the classic Zombie so I'm not overly impressed. Nevertheless, it's certainly not a waste of time.",1309219200,,3825,4.622974963181148

Expect lots of Fulci and lots of gore, but with that being said, this is a movie which I'd recommend mostly to fans only (everyone else could probably just stop after New York Ripper).  It wouldn't surprise me if this had the lowest budget of any Fulci film, it basically reuses scenes from other late period Fulci films with added footage of Fulci, the effect is sometimes disjointed and its easy to see why this film divides Fulci fans.

He's on the set, carving out a tale of a man who butchers his wife and dines upon her choicest bits, leaving the scraps to his hog. Fulci is overworked, exhausted, and close to breaking. He goes to lunch, but finds he has no appetite for his favorites, filet mignon and steak tartare. They remind him too much of the morning's shoot. He tries to go home and rest, but his neighbor is cutting up wood in the backyard, and he hallucinates the man covered in blood, the moans of the dying filling his head and driving him close to insanity. It feels, he says, as if a cat were eating his brain.

The disturbance sends Fulci searching for a psychiatrist. Lying on the couch of Egon Schwarz, he confesses his fears. The psychiatrist explains to him that the walls between reality and the horror he creates are breaking down. Fulci tries to return to the set, to film a sadistic Nazi sex scene, but now he feels nothing at all; he's seen it all before. A documentary crew arrives to film a ""making-of"" movie, and Fulci tears the clothes off the head of the crew; he apologizes profusely, but she confesses that it was the most thrilling moment of her life. Everything is upside down, and not just for Fulci. To be attacked by the master of horror is the finest moment this woman has ever experienced.

Despairing, Fulci returns to the psychiatrist, who says he can plant a hypnotic suggestion that will ease Fulci's mind. Dr. Schwarz has other plans for Fulci, however; the suggestion he plants tears down the final barriers between reality and Fulci's horror-filled imagination. Now Dr. Schwarz can commit murders and Fulci will believe that it is he who is the villain. The body count skyrockets.

Lavish and strange, A Cat in the Brain is unlike any other giallo we have seen. Excellent special effects, surreal scenes, and a surprisingly good performance by Fulci himself all work together to warp the world into a fiendish frenzy. The film was clearly made for Fulci fans; others will probably see it as self-indulgent and contrived. But for those who love Fulci's work, the running internal commentary provides a window into Fulci's mind that will delight.",1303948800,,2322,4.714285714285714

I expected a lot out of this film and it sorta kinda delivered.  It took me a couple of times to get through it, not because I couldn't handle the gore or anything lame like that, I just couldn't get into the story the way I should have.  It's an enjoyable little piece that has pacing problems, but if you're a fan of either Fulci or horror or both, you're still in for a treat.",1300060800,,497,3.891089108910891

1623975,2,B00005M209,"Well, not quite as bad as I had been led to believe, but not good either. Fulci plays himself as a director haunted by violent scenes from his own (and other people's) films, and ends up going to a psychiatrist for help.  As it turns out however, the psychiatrist is a real life psycho, trapped in a loveless marriage, and uses Fulci's problems as an excuse to go on a murder spree with the intention of ultimately framing Fulci himself for the crimes. While Fulci does a reasonable job playing himself, the psychiatrist provides one of the worst performances I have seen on screen for many a year, being alternately wooden or over the top hammy.  But I guess the primary reason people watch this film is because of the much hyped gore sequences. Well, while it is true there are numerous such scenes in the film, I am afraid much of the gore is of very poor quality - with dodgy rubber prosthetics and cheap looking severed heads.  I am afraid I felt myself nodding off between the scenes of carnage, which is surely not a good sign.",1250294400,4,1034,4.4603174603174605

That's all you really need to know going into this film.  Chances are you're  on this page because you're an exploitation fan or you like Fulci, if that's the case than this film is for you.

He keeps seeing strange horrible images everywhere he goes,(The movie utilizes a lot of gore scenes from other Fulci films.)

1623978,4,B00005M209,"FILM: this later day fulci film is a little hard for me to explain but i'll try my best. lucio fulci stars as himself(?), a director of gory horror films who lately has been halucinating and having visons of bizzare sex and violence. he seems to be going crazy so he sees a psychiatrist who happens to be a serial killer. the psychiatrist decides to use fulci as a diversion to his slayings because since fulci is going crazy amd seeing things he sometimes ends up at the scenes of the shrinks crimes. that probably isn't a very good explanation of the plot but cat in the brain isn't to concerned about following a good plot. no, cat in the brain is much more interested in filling the screen with graphic, brutal murder sequences and disgusting gore. fulci has always beem known for doing over the top gore and cat in the brain is no exception. the gore sort of comes in 2 forms: scens shot for the film (the psychiatrists murders, some of fulcis visions) and footage taken from some of fulcis other films and films he's produced (the films fulcis character is directing in the movie, some of fulcis visions). so some of the gore and violence is from other films. most notebly all the gore from fulcis Touch Of Death ends up in this film, some of it as a film fulci is directing and some as murders happening in the actual film. any way, theres plenty of gore. hands are hacked off, limbs are eviscerated, faces are bashed apart, throats are sliced, guts are ripped out, there are many stab wounds and heads are lopped off by chainsaws in usual fulci detail. any one who doesnt like gore will want to avoid this film, as will any one who doesnt like seeing woman being killed. i'm not saying that fulci is a woman hater or takes pleasure in woman being mutilated but some of the murders of the female characters have a bit of sexuality mixed into the violence like when right before a woman is disembowled with a hook her skirt is ripped off, leaving her running around in her underpants. or another scene where a hooker runs through the forest topless before having her throat carved. maybe i'm just over analyzing things but it seems a little mysoginistic (probably not spelled right). personally, i don't mind these scenes. its just a movie, and its a movie you cant really take seriously. the special effects are cheap(but satisfying)and the acting is very hammy so if your offended then grow up, there are better things to be upset about. cat in the brain is a very fun little film. the mix of graphic gore and hammy, comedic acting combine to make cat in the brain one of fulcis most enjoyable films. it drags in some parts and some scenes show a serious lack in funds but the movie is fun to watch. any fan of fulci and trash cinema will not regret seeing cat in the brain. 4/5

DVD: i've been waiting for a lonmg time to get this film on dvd. having seen it on bootleg dvd before i couldn't wait to get a legit release. grindhouse has (as always) done a stellar job with this dvd. the film is uncut and the quality is fantastic. the extras are a real treat especially the interviews with fulci. there are over 90 minutes of fulci interviews, a 40-50 minute interview with the star of Touch Of Death and some brief interviews with other actors who've worked with fulci. there are of course the slew of trailers to films grindhouse is taking its sweet time releasing. if grindhouse released more films then they would probably be the #1 company of exploitation/horror releases. i guess you cant blame them for the small rouster considering the huge amount of material put on thier dvds. this is a great dvd, don't hesitate to pick it up.

The plethora of extras is the best reason to get this--extended interviews, lots of trailers, etc.  My logic is this---you would probably not be interested in this if you weren't a Fulci fan, and a Fulci fan will love all these bonus materials.

1623991,4,B00005M209,"Cat in the Brain blu-ray

There's a lot of mixed feelings on the blu-ray edition of Cat in the Brain from Grindhouse Releasing; First and foremost this was a very low budget film that was shot on 16MM. Now of course there's been other low budget films that used 16mm and looked fine on blu-ray, but different film print and so on have to be remembered and also you have to take into consideration is that Cat in the Brain mixes footage from 6 different films so with all those different sources there's really only so much that can be done and to deliver a true restoration that would be very costly and even if Grindhouse had the means, but the sales even if strong probably wouldn't justify it. The biggest problem is from DVD to blu-ray every fan of cult cinema holds Grindhouse Releasing in very high standards, which could be the reason for the mixed feelings. All I can say is I'm not knowledgable in terms of deep detail with the transfer, but can give a basic idea. While I haven't done a frame by frame comparison, and based on screenshots I was able to come across there doesn't seem to be a huge difference. From what I compared from my DVD to blu-ray the footage filmed for Cat in the Brain does show some improvements in detail and clarity and colors are also stronger. As for the footage edited into Cat in the Brain it does look a little better, but it's still a little rough looking. The upgrade here isn't huge, but this isn't simply an upconvert, but it is clear Grindhouse used the same HD master created for the DVD rather than a new scan. That's actually quite common to use an existing HD scan rather than creating a new one. Grindhouse used an existing HD master for the Beyond, but the DVD for Pieces was mastered in HD, but for the blu-ray they created a new 4k scan. The transfer for the blu-ray of Pieces got rave reviews, but the Beyond did draw some mixed reviews, but I found it quite pleasing, but I would say Cat in the Brain isn't quite as strong as the Beyond, but I suppose due to the film elements that should be expected.

As for upgrading I guess it depends on how one feels about the film. If you're a big fan than you'll want it anyways right? But if you're basing that off an upgrade in video than perhaps you may wanna hold off and than circle back around for this and grab other films you've been meaning to add to your collection. If you don't own the DVD and are a fan of this than by all means go for it. However if extras are important than Cat in the Brain is more than worth the upgrade as it carries over all the features from the DVD and adds in a slew of new ones and that makes this release a nice upgrade over the DVD. This release will end up a top 10 release for cult cinema in 2016, but that's again more due to the features.

There's been comments about DNR, which I personally didn't notice. Basically all the flaws with the video on the DVD are present here, which is how I know it's the same HD master from the DVD. As I mentioned this isn't simply an upconvert and just call it a day. The Anchor Bay blu-ray of Silent Night, Deadly Night was clearly nothing more than an upconvert as its identical to the DVD with very and I mean very slight improvements. The footage that was filmed for Cat in the Brain does again show some improvements even if not a huge upgrade, but again clarity, detail and color are stronger than the DVD. The footage sourced from other other films is where we don't see as much of a difference and like how the DVD quality would be up and down that can also be said here, but like I mentioned 6 different film elements were mixed in so you really shouldn't expect a major leap in quality, but even the footage edited in does show some minor improvements.

While I'm happy about my purchase, but going on just the video quality it does again show some improvements, but if I could only view Cat in the Brain on DVD I wouldn't say it was a downgrade. But the extras more than make up for the minor video upgrade.

In closing I'm happy with picking up the blu-ray and despite what some reviews say there is improvements here that give it the edge over the DVD, but only it's not a major upgrade. It's the extras that elevate the release. So again the major reason for getting this on blu-ray is for the extras. If you don't really care about that and the video is the only factor than you may wanna wait for a sale as again even with the upgrade in video it isn't major.",1239148800,9,4454,4.247641509433962
1623992,4,B00005M209,"A CAT IN THE BRAIN (aka NIGHTMARE CONCERT) was for many years Lucio Fulci's most elusive horror title... so much so that I had never seen it until I received this fine DVD edition. The film had been announced as an upcoming release twice before, and both times was canceled for reasons unknown to me. So, when this third announcement came, I was skeptical until I actually had the disc in hand. I'm pleased to say that the film is worth the wait; it's both revolting and humorous, and the package includes a generous selection of extras that are actually worth watching. A CAT IN THE BRAIN will most certainly please Fulci addicts with its non-stop parade of hardcore gore, which is presented with such comic gusto that it approaches H. G. Lewis' self-deprecating satire. Yes, the film does make liberal use of stock footage from earlier films, but said footage is well integrated into the story, and these films are largely unknown in the USA. Although Fulci stars as himself, and is clearly no actor, in his own peculiar fashion he has made a film about filmmaking that is as entertaining in its way as 8 1/2 or THE PLAYER. Even those who hate Lucio Fulci's horror titles may take to this one! The quality of this DVD set is fine throughout! And I love the 3D cover! So buy it!",1238630400,4,1279,4.517241379310345
1623993,4,B00005M209,"Those saints at Grindhouse have finally given us Cat In The Brain, and being the cool guys they are, have given the DVD excellent treatment.  There are a bunch of interviews(two with Fulci himself), Fulci's appearance at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors, trailers, galleries and the whole shebang.  A very nice package with a groovy hologram cover.
Hows about the movie?  It won't quite tickle you like Fulci's classics, but it's quite good.  As I'm sure you know(about 100 times over)Fulci is playing himself in this film.  He's become quite disturbed and disillusioned by his constant shooting of violent films, and the lines between his work and his life start to blur(some of these scenes are really well done).  He goes to a wacko psychoanalyst(but aren't they all?) for help, but the Doc takes advantage of Fulci's predicament to go on a murder spree for some odd reason(his wife being a hoochie momma may have something to do with it, or maybe he's just having a slow day).  For the Doc, Fulci will make the perfect scapegoat.  He convinces Fulci under hypnosis that Fulci is the one committing the crimes during his horror movie directing induced episodes, while the Doc is really the one doing the deed(the huge grin worn by the Doc as he stalks his victims is funny yet sinister at the same time).
That's your plot, folks.  A Woody Allen movie gone mad!!  It's more in the giallo vein, except there's really no mystery going on, only a question of what's real and what's in Fulci's mind.  And it is a gory one too, as you might have guessed.  Yes, there is footage from some of Fulci's lesser known films, as well as Bianchi's Massacre, but I didn't find this so appalling and distracting as some did.  In fact, I think it actually fit what was going on pretty well.
It's cool to see Fulci doing something a bit different and poking fun at his career.  Though still brutal, gory and kinda comically dubbed like many of his films, it's like nothing else he's done before.  I'd actually suggest this to the critics(including Roger Ebert) who had probably only seen Zombie and/or The Beyond and feel Fulci is nothing more than a hack horror director.  Oh hell, who am I kidding?  They already have their minds made up.  But regardless, Fulci fans have never given a hoot about what other people say, so it's all good.  Obviously this is recommended for the Fulci fan, though that really goes without saying.
Thanks again, Grindhouse.",1238198400,19,2437,4.691764705882353

Fulci fans you need to pick this release up for the rare extras even if you are not a fan of the film. Some of the extras are Fulci's rare first and only US horror convention visit at the 1996 Fangoria Weekend of Horrors, which is a real treat for horror fans such as myself who never got this on a nth generation bootleg. The is also a short hidden extra showing Fulci signing autographs on disc one, just select the eyeball in the extras menu on disc 1. Disc 2 has some in depth interviews with Lucio Fulci and Brett Halsey as well as 3 very short talks with some actors from Cat in the Brain remembering Fulci. Also on the second disc are the biographies and filmographies for Lucio Fulci and Brett Halsey. Lastly you also get a booklet with linear notes from Lucio's daughter Antonella, Eli Roth, and writer David J. Schow. All in all for such a obscure film, this DVD is absolutely loaded with extra material.

The film itself is oddly enough a self reflection/parody for Lucio and is about himself as a director being driven to madness because of the violent imagery in his films. The murders of his films start happening off the screen and Lucio gradually starts to believe it's his fault people are dying. It's an entertaining film and definitely worth a viewing if you're familiar with some of Fulci's work. If you've never seen a Fulci film before I recommend seeing his 2 most popular fan films Zombie and The Beyond first just to get a feel for his work.

Its great to see Fulci act in his own film for the entire duration and enter his own honorific cinematic world.

The storyline isn't the best, but the energy is where most of the film's enjoyment stems from. It's best to enjoy this crazy flick on day when you want to see the old master work his magic tricks one final heroic time. It's a nostalgic piece and recalls the past glory days of the maestro's cinematic masterpieces.

Lucio Fulci is without question, one the finest horror directors to ever work in the medium, with utter masterpieces as THE BEYOND, ZOMBI, and THE PSYCHIC. Although this film is not as strong as those defining adventures, its a brilliant companion to Fulci's fantastic career.

Remember, it was made well past the time that Fulci made his visceral horror masterpiece THE BEYOND, so it wouldn't be fair to compare it with that film, ZOMBIE, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, etc.

CAT IN THE BRAIN (also known as NIGHTMARE CONCERT) stars Lucio Fulci as himself - a horror movie director who is having a bit of a breakdown as a result of all of the violent images he creates for the screen.  Soon, it seems people are being murdered just like in his films.  Are the horror films Fulci creates causing him to lose touch with reality and actually murder people in real life?

Much has been said about Fulci, from that he was a tyrant on set to him being a lovable, funny and quirky character.  His lead performance in this film shows that lovable, funny side.  He is clearly poking fun at the films he has made, certainly not taking them too seriously.  But at the same time, his film is making a comment about the notion that violence in film leads to violence in real life and the hypocrisies practiced by those who often make such ridiculous remarks.

If you don't care about Fulci or social commentary but just want a fun, gory film, this is for you too.  Much of the gore is taken from other late '80s Fulci productions, and some criticize that fact.  But why criticize what was precisely the point of the film to begin with??  This wasn't merely a question of budget -- the movie is about Fulci as a director of gore films.  Why not use the exact scenes he created for other films to illustrate his filmed visions of violence?

For those who didn't enjoy CAT IN THE BRAIN the first time around, it deserves another look.  And for those who have no idea who Lucio Fulci is, to me you don't get the full picture without seeing his incredibly entertaining performance in this film.",1237507200,,1961,4.405555555555556
