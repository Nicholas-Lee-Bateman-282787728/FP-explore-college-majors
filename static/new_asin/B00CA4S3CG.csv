8579043,4,B00CA4S3CG,"My main interest in this set was to acquire ""Pitfall"" and the commentary for ""Martha Ivers"".  I very much enjoyed ""Pitfall"" and am pleased with its presentation.  The print is quite good with only minor imperfections.  There is a restoration comparison for ""Martha Ivers"", but even then the Paramount DVD has much better picture quality.  The Paramount DVD has no extras and this Film Chest DVD has the commentary and a trailer.  ""The Stranger"" also has a restoration comparison, but I still think the M-G-M DVD edition is better in terms of picture quality.  You get a trailer on the Film Chest edition while the M-G-M has no extras.",1388188800,21,634,4.770642201834862
