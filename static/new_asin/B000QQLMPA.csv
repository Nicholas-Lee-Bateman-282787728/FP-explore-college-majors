8196806,5,B000QQLMPA,Great Tour of Dublin and the Novel by a scholar who enthusiaticaly enjoyed the it the way Joyce intended it to be,1487376000,2,113,4.181818181818182
8196807,5,B000QQLMPA,"Very nice stroll through the land of Ulysses.  Only misstep is the clarity of the readings - although, the auditorium/microphone echo has a ghostly, from the grave quality.  The museum host is filled with true deference and sheer joy for Joyce and the home they both have shared.",1406764800,5,279,4.791666666666667
8196808,5,B000QQLMPA,I bought this dvd on a whim and was pleased that it was not only a tour of Dublin but in a way a video version of cliff notes for Ulysses.  If I'm ever lucky enough to make it to Ireland I'll make a point of visiting the museum and hopefully congratulating the narrator on a job well done.,1301184000,10,289,3.8983050847457625
8196809,3,B000QQLMPA,"Our Dublin guide Robert Nicholson (curator of the James Joyce Museum) is a game amateur in the original sense; his awkward bounding love manifesting in the odd flick of spittle heading the lens' way.  Many of the original buildings from the famous novel are gone, but the lay of the land is the same, and Harrison takes the viewer on an affable armchair ambulation.  The DVD is done dirt cheap, which mostly adds to its silly charm, the sad exception being the poor sound quality of the brief readings of the corresponding episodes of Ulysses which introduce each station of Bloom and Stephen's passionate day.  For Joyce completists mostly.",1263600000,21,641,4.862385321100917
8196810,5,B000QQLMPA,"This is a truly glorious renewal and reenactment of Joyce's Ulysses, as each of the episodes is renewed by way of a reenactment by way of the actual place and its environment. Thereby the whole novel is reenacted and we encounter again each of its characters in the very context of their Dublin world.",1259971200,14,301,4.592592592592593
