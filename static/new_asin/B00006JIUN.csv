7970390,1,B00006JIUN,This DVD is one of the most boring I ever seen.  It is dated and the individuals interviewed throughout the DVD have zero personality and enthusiasm.  Definitely doesn't do a very good job of making Key West a possible exciting destination to visit.  Better off with a current Frommer's Travel Guide.,1301702400,,300,4.8431372549019605
7970391,2,B00006JIUN,"I thought it would be a vacation guide to Key West. It was not. Firstly, it is very short. Just over 50 minutes. It did not  point out specific sites or the best places to go (someone had stated it was an ""insiders view"", I would disagree). It did feature the ""Conch Train"" which was sort of interesting. But it was mainly a historical/cultural look at Key West. In doing so, it was far too brief to be particularly effective.
Also, it came in a cheap cardboard container. Not the typical size or construction of a DVD container. For the price, I expect better.
Bottom line, if you are looking for a vacation guide try something else. If you just want to see what Key West ""looks like"", you may enjoy this DVD. Even then, it is far to brief to justify the cost ... Not particularly well done either.",1049932800,,799,4.326666666666667
7970392,5,B00006JIUN,"Even if you have been a repeat visitor to Key West, the zest of this dvd exploration will make you want to go back again.  Mr. McGill's montage reveals the magic of Key West and why its allure never fades.  It is an enchanted place, and these delightful DVD images show  why.

7970393,4,B00006JIUN,"I bought this DVD while on a visit to Key West recently and wished I had seen it before I left on my trip. I found out it was produced by local professionals, and you can tell because it contains no silly ads or commercial content. Just carefully-selected, beautiful scenery of the island, the reefs, aerial stuff...and great interviews throughout with some truly colorful Key Westers. Captain Outrageous could only live, and ""work"", in Key West! Nice work!",1030579200,,457,4.871794871794871
7970394,5,B00006JIUN,"If ever there was a temptation to pack  and depart immediately for the southernmost city, this DVD is IT! Thoughtfully and skillfully produced, the vivid flavor of this island city enthusastically jumps out to grab the viewer while at the same time wrapping itself 'round like a languid and sultry tropical afternoon. The characters are real, the tempo is palpable. I am not wasting any more time on this review - I am too busy packing!",1030579200,,436,4.7368421052631575
