7846062,5,6303362222,"I like above all Bergman, but the ""second Bergman"", the biographical Bergman: ""Fanny and Alexander"", ""The best intentions"", ""Sarabande"", ""Private confessions"". Also the wonderful ""Scenes of a marriage"" from 1972 (The best intentions was directed by Bill August und Private confessions by Live Ullmann, but based on novels and screen-play of Bergman and in best Bergman's manner.

Sanday's children, by his son Daniel Bergman, is a nice complement of Best Intentions and Private Confessions. Not a masterpiece, but anyway interesting for people who likes Bergman and wants to know more of his life.",1390003200,,597,5.419354838709677
7846063,4,6303362222,"A lovely, interesting film, given more meaning by being the third of
the three parts that more or less make up the history of Ingmar
Bergman's family; starting with the sublime Fanny and Alexander, moving
on to The Best Intentions, and then ending with Sunday's Children,
which starts in the 1920s, but jumps forward and back to the late 1960s
occasionally, where a character named Ingmar is confronting his dying
father, from whom he's long felt estranged.

Most of the film focuses on the Ingmar character's childhood, in
typical Bergman fashion, capturing the complexities of family life,
good and bad, funny and heartbreaking. Also fascinating is that Ingmar
Bergman chose his own son, Daniel, to direct this story of Ingmar
Bergman's relationship with HIS father.

While there's clearly a certain poetry to that choice, I'm not sure it
was the strongest possible one artistically. Unlike Billie August with
'The Best Intentions', Daniel Bergman sometimes seems to just be doing
an imitation of his father's style, and that lack of an organic feeling
to the film-making keeps this from fully soaring.

But the complexity of seeing the father/son relationship though both a
child's eyes, when his father seems like a basically decent man with
problems. and his adult perspective on the same behavior as cold and
destructive is pretty fascinating.

It's very frustrating that this terrific looking, and important film has never been
released on DVD.

A complex film I look forward to seeing again.",1333670400,,1499,5.127049180327869
7846064,5,6303362222,"So many vastly inferior, C-list films are available on DVD, why is one of Bergman's best movies, indeed, ANY Bergman movie, not out on DVD?! This is enexcusable.",1295308800,,161,4.785714285714286
7846065,5,6303362222,"This beautiful evocative film was taken from a written text by Ingmar Bergman, and filmed perfectly by his director son Daniel and long-time cinematographer Sven Nykvist. It really amounts to a final Bergman film, and as such, it deserves an excellent Criterion DVD release.",1235088000,2,274,5.25
7846066,5,6303362222,"Sunday's Children is one of the most insightful films about parent/child relations I have ever seen.  The camera follows the activities of Pu, a young Sweedish boy vacationing in the country with his family.  Pu's father is a minister who is struggling to make sense of his life and reconcile with his wife, who finds it increasingly difficult to live with him.
Pu is an especially observant child who sees and feels the suffering of people and animals and thinks God must be wicked to allow so many terrible things to happen in this world.  In one scene Pu watches as a farmer bludgeons to death his calf with a large ax.  Scenes like this are painful to watch as are Pu's often strained relations with his family.
Pu decides to travel with his father to church for the Sunday services.  On the ferry Pu is sitting on the edge of the boat and his father discovers him there and slaps him several times across the face because Pu has put himself in danger.  We know what both father and son are feeling and we know they are both right for being upset.  This one example demonstrates how complicated this film is and also how truthful it is.
We find no easy answers in Sunday's Children.  Life is full of suffering and some of the pain comes from our illusions about how our parents should behave toward us.  Pu blames his father for some of his unhappiness, both as a child and then later as an adult.  The viewer knows that Pu is not wrong, but he is not right either.  Pity and compassion are independent of right and wrong and simply allow us to empathize with the suffering we see in other people.  In the end Pu's father is dying and Pu is unable to forget the past and forgive in the present.
Sunday's Children goes far beyond entertainment.  It is cinema verite that holds a mirror up to life and let's us see a bit of the truth about ourselves and our own families.  The truth that this film illustrates is that as we want to be forgiven, so must we be willing to forgive.
Many viewers who have not seen Bergman's Fanny and Alexander will find that film equally disturbing and fascinating.",1005264000,13,2097,4.412987012987013
