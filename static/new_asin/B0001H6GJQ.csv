8012488,1,B0001H6GJQ,"Ghosts have escaped from the films projected in a movie theater, and they are wrecking havoc amongst the moviegoers as they cannot leave the theater and are forced to watch a stream of awful movies endlessly. It's hard to tell how good or bad the acting is as the sound is intentionally distorted - there is nothing wrong with your entertainment center - except for one instance in which they all sing a silly song to exorcise the ghosts and demos from the theater. The film is 95% all clips from various F grade class movies, in a couple you'll recognize the actors mentioned in the DVD box, but they played no part in this piece of junk. It belongs in the same collection as ""Begotten (1991)"", ""Eraserhead"", the rape scene in ""Irreversible"", some of Pedro Amodovar's very early films, Andy Warhol's ""Frankenstein"", Farenhype 911, ""I stand Alone"", or ""Fireproof"" ...  None of these qualify as movies to be watched while hanging with your buddies over some beers on a Friday or Saturday night - thoroughly disturbing, and the inevitable sense of having been cheated.",1375660800,,1066,4.762162162162162
8012489,1,B0001H6GJQ,"Horrible acting, horrible editting, horrible costumes, horrible effects, etc, etc, I could go on and on.  I seen homes decorated at Halloween better than the decorated studios in this low, low budget flick.  Could not understand what some people were saying because of the overly used echo they had on some of the voices.  And the props?  Someone dressed up a monster eating a plastic,,,hmmmmmm,,doggie toy.  I am suprised it did not squeak as he put it in his mouth.  The editor should be ashamed for himself.  You can see the quality from film to video tape with a few jump cuts in between.  Don't waste your time watching this or spend any money on it.  Not even worth the $1 store price!  The only reason it got a one star rating is because CDNow won't let me go any lower than that!",1132012800,3,787,4.440559440559441
8012490,1,B0001H6GJQ,"""Reel Horror"" is one of the most odious films ever made. It is dreadful beyond all ability to comprehend. I knew that I was in trouble when the opening credits announced ""A Ross Hagen Film"" and ""Conceived and Directed by Ross Hagen."" You may be familiar with Ross Hagen for his role in ""Sidehackers"" (made famous by MST3K) as ""Rommel"". Eventually Rommel was shot in the back in ""Sidehackers"", which less politically correct viewers may think too kind a fate after viewing ""Reel Horror.""

The film is basically unrelated snippets of eight different (awful in their own right) horror movies combined with ""host segments"" featuring the least talented cast in film history, including a one eyed woman and the creepiest dwarf sidekick I have ever seen. The only thing I found entertaining in the entire film was the closing credit reading ""Eye Patches - Tony Mack."" It is true: there were a lot of eye patches featured here, and they were the best thing in the film.

I can't even begin to know where to start in discussing the ""plot"", but the film jumps right in with both feet in some footage of Donald Pleasance as a black panther jumping around in some haunted woods. The only other significant performance by a name you would recognize is that of Vic Tayback portraying an insane and abusive Italian butcher, with an idiotic apprentice butcher in training who has to hunt down a mute girl pulling an American Flyer wagon in his hearse full of pig carcasses. (It makes even less sense when you actually watch it.) This part of the film is actually genuinely gross, featuring shocking and disturbing actual chicken beheadings.  The box says it features John Carradine, who I have seen in many, many movies. I never saw him show up. Either his was a very small part or my eyes had glazed over and rolled back into my head when he was onscreen. Others I did recognize included Victor Buono, Ross Hagen, and Julie Newmar.

This movie has the worst editing I have ever seen, period. It makes ""Manos"" appear well crafted and thoughtful, and ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman"" appear logical and intelligent by comparison. There is an overriding principle at work in this film: Never let the audience know what is going on, at any cost.

One other aside before I go throw my copy in the trash compactor: the host segments are physically uncomfortable to watch, particularly the musical segments, the ""fat demon"", segment, and the ""pig seance"" segment.

This movie is best actually viewed in a vomitorium.",1093564800,9,2496,4.73963133640553
