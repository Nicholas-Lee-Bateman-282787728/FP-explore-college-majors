5963886,1,B00F2N512M,Terrible movie a waste of time !!!!!!!! How this ever became a movie is beyond me . The actors can' act and the director can't direct .,1388361600,2,135,4.037037037037037
5963887,5,B00F2N512M,"Very dirty bad taste movie! I'd seen a few minutes that was enough. Its just plain perverted. To each their own, sure not me",1388275200,2,124,4.208333333333333
5963888,2,B00F2N512M,Movie had very little plot except to show Ms. Oldham's skimpy attire. Was a subtile subplot to draw attention to fact that phone sex invades all levels of society.,1388275200,,163,4.655172413793103
5963889,2,B00F2N512M,"Amazon website picture quality was very good.  The movie is so, so. I was looking through the Amazon movie list and was just really checking it out. I watched the movie for about 10 minutes and it did not hold my interest.",1388102400,,222,4.285714285714286
5963890,5,B00F2N512M,"A sex-line operator / performer named Summer (Christy Oldham) has had her fill of weirdoes, sick-os, and psychos. Unbeknownst to some of her more criminally-minded customers, she's been secretly recording some of their confessed, highly illegal exploits. Summer decides to take the law into her own hands, setting out on a mission to rid the world of dangerous, and / or hypocritical perverts. She goes on a road-trip, sort of a ""destroy-all-rapists-and-pedophiles"" tour. One by one, the creep-sters fall! BARRACUDA is an off-center, comedy / revenge film. Ms. Oldham is quite convincing in her angry role. As disturbing as the subject matter is, the absurd humor is insane enough to make the whole story more of a ludicrous romp. Not for everyone (the person I watched it w/ thought it was terrible), but I thought it was a riot!...",1396828800,,833,5.0
5963891,5,B00F2N512M,"revenge movies seem to be very popular these days, and this is a good one. besides, it wasn't all revenge,mostly vigilante about something that needed to be done.",1389052800,2,162,4.821428571428571
5963892,3,B00F2N512M,"Nice to see scumbags get some of their own, even in a fictional sense LOL Should happen more in real life..",1389052800,,107,4.142857142857143
5963893,4,B00F2N512M,"When I first saw the trailer, I equated the film with production values reminiscent of those employed in ""Grindhouse"" (a distinct 70's ""low budget on purpose"" sensibility); the reality is quite different. I found the cinematography excellent and the editing crisp. The plot is quite interesting (though taking a lot of artistic license regarding police procedures), and the acting is first rate. Christy Oldham carries the picture, but with an excellent supporting cast. The movie has good pace and is ultimately a very enjoyable cinematic experience. There is no nudity, despite the implicit premise of the film (phone sex worker vigilante), but it's not part of the integral plot line and the way the film is constructed, would have been gratuitous. Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone interested in obtaining a strong action film with a good plot line, excellent performances and a Tarantino like sensibility.",1388966400,3,923,5.243243243243243
5963894,5,B00F2N512M,"I do not think that men will like this movie...lol! It is a about a painter who works phone sex on the side to pay her bills and realizes that some of the ""fantasies"" of her customers are reality.  How she deals with it and how it relates to her own childhood is the focus of the movie.  It is a little on the campy side but I thought the camera work and acting was excellent for a low budget film.  The twists and turns in the plot were not predictable. This is definitely not for children.  A guilty pleasure.",1388793600,2,511,4.08
5963895,2,B00F2N512M,"Interesting premise, really weak delivery. This move was like someone's random thought, blown up into a full length movie that no one could figure out what do do with. Kind of frustrating to watch when there were opportunities for some interesting twists that the writers et al didn't pick up on. Skip it.",1388707200,,305,4.773584905660377
5963896,4,B00F2N512M,There were some disturbing images in this movie. I wasn't surprised by that. The movie was interesting and engaging. I probably won't watch it again but I do not regret watching it.,1388620800,,181,4.6875
5963897,5,B00F2N512M,True to life portrayal of 90% of the men out there. Could have used a bit more violence overall 5 stars. Good job Christy!,1388448000,,122,4.125
5963898,1,B00F2N512M,"it`s basically unwatchable. This,coupled with the fact that it is poorly written(appararently,improvised for the most part)and very boring.  Don`t waste your time.",1388361600,,163,6.409090909090909
5963899,1,B00F2N512M,"Unbelievably bad movie. A sick, twisted, white trash,middle aged skank in a beat up old Plymouth Barracuda sets out to wreck revenge on her former sex chat customers, but really because her step father may have molested her as a child. She is supposed to be an artist but has no talent what so ever. It was written, directed and produced by the main ""actress"". She can't write, direct or act.",1388361600,5,392,4.535211267605634
8611745,1,B00F2N512M,"Summer (Christy Oldham) is a phone sex operator who is shocked at how perverted men really are. She decides to do some vigilante visits. It attempts to create over-the-top characters that fall flat. The film has not withstood time.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1525219200,,265,4.888888888888889
8611746,4,B00F2N512M,One of the best indie movies I've seen.,1511222400,,39,4.0
8611747,4,B00F2N512M,"I enjoyed this project and was able to laugh at points and feel sickened and disturbed at other points.
Cinema should make us feel various emotions not just one.
 I am not someone who will ever jump on the man hating feminist band wagon but this film is fair and has a few heroic male characters and there is no doubt we have perverse sickos in this world.",1451952000,,356,4.235294117647059
8611748,5,B00F2N512M,I love this movie. I'd recommend it for everyone. I will be getting more of their work. Respect,1446768000,,95,4.333333333333333

8611750,1,B00F2N512M,Tried to make it to the Mopar Car she road trips in but it was just too lame to suffer that far. Advice watch Gone In 60 Seconds (either version) for the millionth time instead.,1441843200,,177,4.085714285714285
