2477834,5,B000E112BG,"As has been so well reviewed by the preceding writers, this film centers itself on the life of a group of widows in a small city of India in 1938.

The actors move beautifully through the story with grace and emotion. Contrasting with the two other movies by Deepa Metha, this one has an intense serenity about it, despite the tragic events described.  Great attention to details show in the depiction of secondary characters. One has a clear idea of how these widows have to live in acute poverty, but despite their drab surroundings, the arrival of the child widow, the grace of Lisa Ray (Kalyani) and  of Seema Biswas (Shakuntala)  transcend the tragedy.

The film was to be shot in the sacred city of Varanasi, but the following day of arrival of the crew, 2,000 protesters destroyed the built movie set, and the

film was then cancelled. Deepa Metha started to receive threats to her life.

It is an unforgettable film about the spirit of life,  the connection to the elements and beauty of nature. Truly a  masterpiece, surpassing even some of

Satyajit Ray.

If you decide to go and see it, you will probably sit at the end of the credits, in silence as it seems that this happens at each showing. It is indeed a deeply transforming experience.",1150156800,10,1251,4.615384615384615
2477835,5,B000E112BG,"Chuyia (Ronica Sarala) is an 8-year old child bride who, after her ""husband"" dies, is sent off to live at a house for widows. She befriends a beautiful young woman named Kalyani (Lisa Ray) who is used by the hateful and corrupt Madhumati (Manorama) to earn money for the house as a prostitute. Chuyia also finds motherly support from Shakuntala (Seemas Biswas), an intelligent, compassionate widow who is angry about her circumstances but feels unable to change them.

Kalyani develops an intense mutual attraction with Narayana (John Abraham), an idealistic, educated young man from the upper class. But a relationship between them is strictly prohibited by Hindu tradition, which considers widows to be ""polluted"" and not allowed to re-marry. Still their romance blossoms in a series of secret encounters and Narayana suggests they get married and leave for Calcutta. Madhumati learns of this and locks Kalyani in her room. But Shakuntla manages to free Kalyani and sends her off to marry Narayana. However, their romance ends in tragedy when it turns out that Narayana's father knows of Kaylani's past as a prostitute. Narayana still wants to marry her. But the shamed Kaylani ends up drowning herself in the Ganges River. The monstrous Madhumati then attempts to turn Chuyia into a child prostitute. But she is saved from this horrible fate by the brave Shakuntala, who feels empowered to act by the social changes taking place in India during this era of Gandhian inspired reform. Finally, Shakuntala manages to bring traumatized little Chuyia to Narayana, just as he is leaving on a train with Gandhi and other activists.

This film definitely has an epic tone, especially in its ""Romeo and Juliet"" like story of the tragic romance between Kalyani and Narayana. I don't typically go for this style of film. But ""Water"" manages to pull it off fairly well, especially since the film is set in 1930's India. Still what I think takes this movie to a higher level is that it doesn't just focus on their star crossed romance. But instead challenges the dogma of Hindu tradition which called for widows to live out their existence as ""polluted"" wretches segregated from society. Of course, this was a hopeful time in India, as Gandhi and his followers were trying not only to achieve independence from Britain. But also uplift the downtrodden, including Untouchables and women. The sad reality is that the Gandhian movement only manged to transform Indian society to a certain extent. Even today most women, especially among the poor, are still considered second class citizens in India and severely oppressed, a fact that I witnessed first hand while visiting the country. Even worse, there is currently a strong Hindu fundamentalist movement which has gained a serious level of political power while trying to roll back the social reforms of modern India. It was these fanatics who waged violent protests during the shooting of this picture. But brave director Deepa Mehta managed to complete the movie anyway. So congratulations to her and all involved in this outstanding film.",1149897600,12,3080,5.061023622047244
2477836,4,B000E112BG,"When I was in film school, I remember a professor showing an Indian film called ""Panther Panchali"". Despite the terrible print, I could see director Satyajit Ray was an artist. ""Panchali"" is a beautiful film about a poor Indian family living through the monsoon season. I then went on to discover some of his other films. A couple of years ago, Merchant Ivory hosted a retrospective of Ray's films and these restored prints are available on DVD. You are depriving yourself if you do not watch these films.

As I watched ""Water"", the new film from director Deepa Mehta, I was constantly reminded of Ray's films. The composition, pacing, subject matter and acting style are all the same.

Chuyia (Ronica Sajnani Sarala), a seven year old girl, finds she has become a widow; her arranged husband has died leaving her adrift in a society that favors men. Religious law dictates if she lives a chaste life she will join her husband in heaven. Of course, she doesn't know or understand any of this when her family takes her to a home, to live with other widows. She soon meets the matriarch of the house, Sadananda (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), a fat woman who eats the most food, Shakuntala (Seema Biswas), a bitter woman who shows some compassion to Chuyia and Kalyani (Lisa Ray), a young woman who is allowed to grow her hair out and meet `clients' to help support the house. Soon, Chuyia meets Narayana (John Abraham), a bachelor from a rich family who is instantly attracted to Kalyani. As their relationship grows, there are murmurs of Gandhi leading the Indian people to independence from Britain.

Deepa Mehta has crafted a beautiful film depicting a sad reality in India's history. As one character states, families used this religious practice to free themselves of a financial burden and another mouth to feed. In this belief, there are three ways of dealing with a widow; marry her to a younger brother of the deceased male, have her join her husband on the funeral pyre, or banish her to a house to live with other widows until she dies and rejoins her husband in Heaven. Of course, if a wife dies, the husband is free, encouraged to remarry. After Mehta establishes the details of this practice, she introduces us to the main characters, the people who will inhabit the story we are about to watch. There are people from every generation in this house; ""Auntie"" is an elderly widow who still dreams of the sweets she had at her wedding, when she was seven, Sadananda seems to be a gang leader, or pimp, sending Kalyani out to meet married men, to help support the house and her eating habits. Sadly, every generation is represented.

The growing relationship between Kalyani and Narayana is very believable and touching. Indian tradition and the difficulties of Kalyani's position dictate they must behave in a certain way. But Narayana is a modern Indian man and he soon tells his mother he and Kalyani will be married. When his mother finds out his intended bride is a widow, she is shocked and won't allow it. But Narayana has no doubt that he will wed his lover, all it takes is some convincing.

As the story moves towards its emotional climax, Shakuntala becomes the voice of reason. She helps Kalyani get out of the house to meet her lover and eventually helps other members of the house.

Mehta composes every shot with a painter's eye. Vivid colors poke out throughout every frame, colors so bright they appear to be painted on the screen. As we watch these characters struggle to live in the house, they make infrequent trips outside to bathe, walk, and experience. Inside the house, everyone wears a sari made of the same natural cloth and everything is rather drab. But as they explore the neighboring community, we see women wearing bright saris, vivid flowers and bright gold, copper and silver. The difference between the two worlds is very noticeable and helps to contrast the living conditions of the two different groups.

Ray used the same attention to detail in his films creating beautiful compositions in black and white.

Both filmmakers chose similar subject matter. Like Ray before her, Mehta has chosen a fairly simple, straight forward story. Because the story doesn't have a lot of distractions, it allows you to concentrate on the characters and give them your attention. The actors provide vivid, interesting portrayals that compliment the story.

""Water"" is a very good film. Search it out and you will be rewarded.",1149552000,57,4448,4.803921568627451
2477837,5,B000E112BG,"Deepa Mehta's _Water_ was one of the best films I've seen in a really long time.

Nine-year-old Chuyia barely remembers her wedding, and now her father has come to tell her that she is a widow. Her parents take her to an Ashram - a sort of rest home for widows - to live out the rest of her days. There, she meets Auntie, an aged senile old woman, married when she was seven years old, who still longs for the sweets that she had at her wedding. The leader of the ashram, an old, overweight woman and the only one of the women living there who gets full meals, rules like a tyrant and pimps out the young widows to Brahmin men on the other side of the holy river.

One young widow, Kayalyina (sp?) falls in love with a young Brahmin who has embraced the teachings of Ghandi. Tragedy strikes, however, when the differences in their caste prove impossible to overcome. Chuyia escapes the Ashram, but only after much suffering.

The acting, especially by the young girl who plays Chuyia, is incredible here, and the cinematography was astounding. I was deeply moved by this film; I don't believed that I've wept at a movie as much as I did tonight watching _Water_. This film is highly recommended; I can't wait to see the two 'prequels' - Fire and Earth.",1149206400,6,1252,4.411255411255412
2477838,5,B000E112BG,"This haunting, brilliantly acted movie will stay with me for a long time. It was shocking to see the way that widows were treated less than 100 years ago and to realize with dismay that fundamentalists opposed the filming of this movie today!!!

The whole concept of child brides is also repugnant. Very illuminating, beautiful photograpy and powerful acting. Makes you think about the clash between fundamentalism and progress. Highly recommened - definetly not a Hollywood type flick.

2477840,4,B000E112BG,"""Water"" is a beautiful, tragic, sad, emotionally available film about the deplorable situation in India in regards to its many millions of widows: who are segregated into Ashrams, forced to beg in the street, some into prostitution to support the Ashram and are viewed as if not Untouchable...then unavailable for remarriage.

""Water"" focuses on the beautiful very young, as in 9 years old, Chuyia (Sarala), Kalayani (Lisa Ray), both widows and Narayana (John Abraham): a young Ghandhi follower in love with Kalayani.

The time is 1938, India is in social, political and religious upheaval but director Deepa Mehta uses this as only a backdrop for her very personal and tragic story. At times, though her agenda is without a doubt important, Mehta's approach is too overwrought, too heavy-handed. But her film is so gorgeous and her mise en scene so much about the cleansing qualities of color: turquoises, lemon yellows, scarlet reds, lime greens...that most of this didactic quality can be forgiven.

Water can cleanse, Water can heal, Water brings forth life and renewal and ""Water"" is full of these images but it is also about Hope for the future and Redemption through the restorative power of Love.",1147132800,50,1204,5.070707070707071
2477841,5,B000E112BG,"Set in India during the year 1938, this film follows the singular experience of Chuyia, a child widow.  For religious purposes, Indian women were sent to a sanctuary to live out the rest of their lives.  When married, women become part of their husbands and when the husbands depart, dearly or not, it is said a part of the women die.  The film shows the harsh life of an unfair position; the women are reviled, pitied, and outcast.  As Chuyia learns the way of the widows sanctuary, she makes unique relationships with the women there.  It gives pause for thought to the identity and role of women and gratitude for changing times.  It is a beautiful, touching, alarming, endearing film, giving the viewers a glimpse of a time and a culture in social and religious change.",1146960000,5,773,4.647058823529412

It simply tells a very touching story of the experiences of a group of widows during the period that Gandhi was challenging the ethics  and morality of some extreme religious viewpoints in India.  I learned so much from this film that I didn't know about.  Also, the scenery is so beautiful (filmed in Sri Lanka) and the little girl that plays Chuila is an absolutely amazing actress.",1443398400,3,877,4.642857142857143

Widows could include an 8-year-old girl such as the central figure in this story, who had never left her family, but whose marriage was secured too early for her to remember. Upon the death of her husband, she was obliged to enter a life of poverty in a home for widows for the rest of her life. The jewels in the story are the photography and acting, and the complex relationships between the women. The other women emerge to share the storyline. There is tragedy, romance, and flickers of hope. The story ends with a very uncertain flicker of hope for the child widow, but hardly the happy ending most westerners expect from their movies.",1430438400,2,807,4.572413793103448

2478066,5,B000E112BG,"""Water"" (2005)  that was written and directed by Deepa Metha, the Indian-born Canadian film director and screenwriter,  is a final part of her Elements trilogy, Fire, Earth, and Water. Each film deals with serious and often unknown outside of India problems that the country has inherited over its long history of religious traditions that always played highly important role in all aspects of Indian society.
Water, a heart breaking tale of Indian widows, is set during the early 1940s and tells the compelling story of an eight-year-girl who learns that she became a widow. Her parents married her when she was an infant to an unknown man but were taking care of her until she was old enough to become a wife to the husband she never met.  After his death, according to the holy laws the little girl  had only  three choices in her life:  to burn with her husband on the funeral pyre, to marry his younger brother or to become untouchable and spend the rest of her life in an ashram - a shelter for widows at the temple, on the banks of the great river.

Delicately beautiful and colorful film introduces the viewers to several unfortunate widows of different ages who whose families have abandoned them forever. The women have to live together and use any means possible for surviving.  Pain, grief, loss, sacrifices are the essential parts of their daily struggles. Deepa Metha deserves every praise and award she has received for her memorable and passionate film which may shock the viewers who would not imagine what choices were available to a woman - widow back in the days and even now in some rural parts of India. But the film also praises the beauty of nature, joy of friendship, and eventually, it brings hope for better future for those women and their country.

Not only is Water an exquisite work of art,  it is  an important social statement.  So important, indeed, that the Indian government interfered with the production process, cancelled the funding of the film, restricted Metha to shoot in India, and did not stop the fundamentalists' riots that threatened the physical violence toward the female director and the members of the crew.

If the things have improved in India, as the officials proclaim, why the government hated so much just the idea of the film and caused all kinds of obstacles for Deepa Metha and her crew?",1425081600,2,2348,4.767901234567901

2478100,4,B000E112BG,"It is a journey into the paganism and abuses that are India. It is a true story.

One of the first things that got my attention was that the same harsh traditions exist in India no matter which century, this timeline being 1938. They are still practicing the old cruel, pagan customs regarding their women dating back 2000 years taken from the ancient Manu Hindi Script. It is a tale of sadness, loss and pagan practices that need to be abolished. The fact is that women who are widowed at any age end up in Ashrams (filthy prisons) and is truly horrible. It was Ghandi's intentions to give the Untouchables another chance to live life as most of them were widowed as early as age seven after being betrothed or sold by their parents to older men who died suddenly and it is blamed on his wife causing her to be known as a ""husband eater"". This is a travesty!

These widowed women could have been able to live productive lives but instead are used for sexual vice by male family members and other men in the area.  What hypocrisy! They are wasted and tossed out like so much trash proving that India is steeped in gross, moral corruption and pantheism. India is one of the leading countries that refuses to come into the twenty-first century and abolish long-held moral and religious crimes perpetrated against its people especially women and girls.

This film deals with the ""secret selling"" of most of the young girls into prostitution to keep things going. It is a gross and wicked sin and the worst form of human abuse practiced against women and young girls. From the money these poor young women bring in from this evil is handed over to those who run the Ashrams (fat house mothers) making them able to live secret, lavish lives eating gluttonously while all the other women literally starve. They are like walking ghosts in coarse, white linen saris with shaved heads with only death as an escape.

A courageous film maker, Deepa Mehta, wants to inform the world of this inhumane practice in India using her amazing filming talent. In it she uses color and imagery to tell not only of this profound wrong but she also weaves a tender love story like a golden thread and she does it in such a way that is moving and beautiful at the same time. At no time do we lose touch with the actors or the story while the brilliant use of color and shadowy images become her form d'art.

The Ganges is the main element since it is worshipped in India as a [g]od. I think what came to my mind most of all was the harshness of Hinduism. They believe in Karma which doesnt allow for compassion or mercy. People die by the millions with no one to care or assist them especially children. I feel deep sorrow for all those who do not know that God the Creator made them and for a much higher purpose than sexual slavery. One woman stated, maybe Kalyani will come back as a man. This is blatantly reincarnation, one of the main tenants of Hinduism. The Holy Bible states, And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Hebrews 9:27. These are true words regarding death.",1413417600,,3086,4.47246891651865

Not a word is spoken, and yet, through the magic of dynamic, painterly sequencing and well chosen sound, the action is moved; so very much is communicated.

I will note that this film directly questions a system that makes an 8 year old child an irrelevant being for remainder of her lifetime. In fact, should 8 year old children be married? For devout Hindus, this film may be extremely difficult. And that is exactly the point, bringing laser focus to a system that can destroy a child's life.

But the film is NOT a polemic. It is a beautiful exploration of life, the will to live, desire to have something, even in the face of having had everything taken away.

2478218,5,B000E112BG,"Water is the story of a group of women living in an ashram for widows in India in the 1930's. At the beginning, the story seems to be focused mostly on Chuyia, a seven year old girl whose life is over for being a widow. However, as the film progresses, we have a peak into the lives of two other women: Kalyani, who is being prostituted by the ashram master and the help of a transgender pimp, and Shakuntala, a strong woman who is struggling with making sense of that belief that forbids widows to remarry. We're also introduced to Narayan, the son of a Brahmin who, inspired by Ghandi, questions how unreasonable indian traditions can be.

Water isn't a motion picture but a ""motion painting"". It flows slowly like the Ganges (although, apparently, it was shot in Sri Lanka), but every minute of it is so beautiful and enthralling that you never want it to end. The soundtrack adds a hypnotizing element to the stunning photography. All in all, Water is a deeply moving film that depicts both a fiction and non-fiction story.

2478233,5,B000E112BG,"Summary:
The movie begins with a happy Chuyia munching on a sugar cane as the wagon takes her and her sick husband to a doctor. Unfortunately Chuyia's husband dies, and she is forced to shave her head and to live with other widows. She is seven years old. In the house of widows, Madhumati, a corpulent matriarchal figure who uses her position of power to take advantage of her fellow widows, greets Chuyia. Shakuntala, another widow, becomes a pseudo maternal figure to Chuyai. In addition to Shakuntala there is Auntie, an elderly widow whose husband also died when she was seven. Lastly Kalyani, the second youngest widow befriends Chuyai.
These women are sent to this house to live a life without sin. A life where they can receive the bad karma that they have developed over their lifetimes in hopes of being able to achieve moksha (in accordance with the Hindu faith). However, the irony is that some of the people who are in positions of religious power are the most corrupt. Madhumati often sends Kalyani across the river as a prostitute, so that the house of widows has money for rent.
Kalyani and Chuyai meet Narayan, a privileged romantic whose father is of the Brahmin caste. Narayan is instantly infatuated with Kalyani. And despite initial reluctance, Kalyani agrees to marry him. This is controversial during this time because several key hindu scriptures state that, ""A woman who is unfaithful will be reborn in the womb of a jackal"", and even the thought of remarriage of a widow is a sin. Madhumati, disgusted with Kalyani but also fearful for her lack of financial support if Kalyani leaves, gives Kalyani an ultimatum - stay, or leave and never come back. Kalyani chooses the latter, however on the boat ride to Narayan's home, she realizes that one of her previous clients was Narayan's father. She asks Narayan to turn the boat back, but does not tell him her motivations for doing so. Narayan confronts his father who states that a Brahmin can sleep with anybody, and any woman that lies with a Brahmin is blessed.  Narayan, disgusted with his father, goes to the house of widows to find Kalyani, only to find that she has drowned herself due to her grief and shame.
Madhumati, always eager to exploit others for her benefit, uses Chuyia as a replacement for Kalyani, and sends her across the river to one of Kalyani's previous clients. Shakuntala, horrified when she finds out Madhumati's plan rushes out to the river only to find Chuyia traumatized and unable to respond. After spending the night by the river, cradling Chuyia, Shakuntala goes to the train station where she hears Gandhi will be speaking. In a last act of desperation she chases after his leaving train, and pleads for passengers to take Chuyia and to give her a good life. Narayan, who is on the train, takes Chuyia, leaving behind a teary-eyed Shakuntala.
Critique:
Great Movie.  It's very insightful into the socio-economic statuses of widows in India in the 1930s. It also gives a lot of insight into the Hindu faith and how it translates into a human perspective. One quote said by a widow after Auntie dies, summarized their perspective, ""God willing, she'll be reborn a man"".
Water is used in this movie as a symbol. It is a symbol of hope (when Kalyani and Chuyia are dancing), and is used as a symbol of peacegiver (when Kalyani drowns herself). It symbolizes everything that humans need, and so indirectly symbolizes God. This symbolism has a profound effect on anyone watching the movie. It forces us to look on our lives in juxtaposition with the lives of Chuyia and Kalyani, and to find similarities between the main characters and us. We feel relieved that we are lucky enough not to live in such a broken system, however we feel guilty for our fellows who are living within said system.
The movie has less to do with God, but rather with the people who worship God. It is a story of the purity of the downtrodden, and the corruption of the ""pure"". This irony sends a potent message that we receive often enough in sermons and other after school specials - Don't judge a book by its cover.
In my World Religions class, we learned that Hinduism allows people to pursue whatever they want due to the different desires that people want. Hinduism believes that people progress at their own paces and will eventually want to achieve moksha or freedom from the illusion that is life. It teaches that everyone should follow their Dharma, or purpose, otherwise they will reincarnate as a lower life form. This resulted in Hindu caste systems and it was interesting get a perspective on how this affected people's lives, in this case that of widows. But, overall great movie. I would definitely recommend it.",1338681600,3,4705,4.75764993880049

Mehta's daughter, Devyani Saltzman, wrote a following story of the making of this film; ""Shooting Water."" The facts I learned surrounding the filming of this story makes it even more compelling.

You will not see many awful things there-they are just subtly implied, but implied so effectively, that you will think about this for days. I would say, if you are very impressionable, then just read about the movie on wikipedia.
  India is not very unique in putting down women(even in US today men are paid about a third more for the same job, and some still expect woman to do most of the housework, even if they both work outside home), but the intensity of sitution depicted in the movie is terrifying. Almost every religion has its dark side as their main objective is to control others. What they don't understand is, that abuser is never going to be happy either, because people who feel need to abuse feel powerless to begin with.
  The reason I take one star down, because I think, viewers should be given a bit more of history and situation now, if not in the movie, then in special features. I know, that these things are not prevalent everywhere in India(I have a friend from there who divorced her first husband who was unfaithful and married again -and this time successfully in US). I got more questions -like what would happen to kids, especially, if they are small? Do rich people would practise that too or just poor? Why other women were so cruel to the widows, even though they had a very good chance to become widows anytime themselves? Why child marriage was popular? Why would parents agree to marry a child girl to an old man knowing what widow's life would be? What is the situation today?",1336694400,,1605,4.5625

According the ancestral codes, both must live for life a sort of perennial isolation as well as any chance to reconstruct their lives. When her husband dies, the half of them are dead too.

2478241,5,B000E112BG,"`Water' (2006) is the third and final film in Deepa Metha's' trilogy joining `Fire' (1997) and `Earth' (1999). While a slower moving film than the first two it is also the most poetic in atmosphere and much more traditionally Hindu in presentation. Like the two films preceding it `Water' deals with one of those ignored and generally unspoken problems underlying Indian culture. In this case it's the unethical, inhuman treatment of widows.

Synopsis: The film begins with the death of the husband of eight year old child bride Chuyia (Sarala), leaving the little girl a widow at an age when she should still be playing with dolls. She is taken to a rundown ashram housing an impoverished group of widows doomed to live out the rest of her life as outcasts. Chuyia forms an immediate bond with Kalyani (Lisa Ray) whose physical beauty has become the sole means of support for the community through the vehicle of prostitution.

Through a chance encounter Kalyani captures the attention of Narayan (John Abraham), a wealthy, idealistic follower of Gandhi. Soon a proposal of marriage follows and now for the first time Kalyani envisions the possibility of a new, happy life. However traditional beliefs and social pressures work against the young couple at every turn. As Kalyani battles with the superstitions and taboos that seek to deny her one last chance for love those same social evils begin to close in on young Chuyia threatening to enslave her into the same lifestyle Kalyani has endured. will Narayan have the strength of conviction to save them both or are they destined to remain amongst the forgotten and ignored? What would Gandhi do?

Critique: `Water' is a beautifully filmed and heartbreakingly elegant conclusion to Deepa Metha's trilogy. Everything was done to perfection in this film; cinematography, soundtrack, storytelling and wonderful acting with a number of truly memorable performances. Deepa Metha has once again shown how to meld filmmaking with important, contemporary issues without devaluing the cinematic art or the social message. Bravo!",1304812800,2,2072,5.160714285714286

2478243,4,B000E112BG,"Even before the opening credits, I could see by the gorgeous cinematography that WATER was going to be an outstanding film--and it is. The movie takes on the Hindu caste system & focuses on the plight of lower caste widows during the early rise of Gandhi in the 1930's. The widows in the film are sent by relatives (as in parceled out like an ordinary commodity) to a sort of rundown hostel in the poorest section of New Delhi. A toad like elderly female tyrant runs it--but she's not totally bad, she deeply mourns the death of a pet parrot--AND she likes to blow Ganga while praising Shiva...she might be cranky & look like Yoda, but, hey, she's my kind of gal!

The film revolves around 2 major plots: The life of a little girl widowed at the age of 7, and the love between a beautiful widow & prostitute (?) with an upper caste attorney who supports Gandhi & the social modernization movement. The actress Sarala who plays the young girl (making her Bollywood premiere) is outstandingly natural & a pure joy to watch. The adult young woman & the upper caste man are appropriately attractive & star-crossed.

In one scene a very old woman is talking to the girl, telling her that she was also widowed as a child. The happiest moment she can recall was her wedding feast (when she too was 7) where she ate all kinds of candies & sweets. Now she doesn't have the money to buy sweets & often dwells on her only happy memory during her entire lifetime and she constantly reflects on it--often--as us old folks are prone to do. The little girl surprises the old lady while she's sleeping, leaving a large confection near her head for the old woman to see when she wakes up. The woman dies that same night. I don't recall if she at least had the time to wake-up & see her new friend's act of generosity.

When discussing life in general, another widow remarks that if a woman were really, really good in this life, when she dies she might be blest enough to return (reincarnate) as a man. This widow is also spiritually attached to a Hindu priest & his modest Ashram (spiritual teaching/healing center). This sub-plot illustrates how people in general often seek compensation in religion for the hardships of life, a life that--more often than not--seems wholly indifferent to the human condition.

Another character of interest in the movie is a male transvestite who always wears women's clothes--sort of like the ""Gaudy Goddess Line"". I'm not exactly sure what h/she was meant to convey in the movie, but I do know that there is a Hindu deity named Kartikeya who is androgynous. The actor does seem to ""parrot"" (or parody) the emotions of the old tyrant, and together they appear to burlesque a mutually exaggerated emotional view of life.

Now on to negative reactions to
the socio-religious-political implications of WATER.
(Whew!)

The people who gave this film a single star (and probably would have withheld even that if Amazon review rules allowed it), in no uncertain terms denounce the film on political & religious grounds. A lot of the dissention centers on the ancient Texts of Manu (specific date uncertain, but generally between 200 BCE-200 CE). The texts deal with the subject of Hindu spiritual law. As much I am drawn to Hindu practices & incorporate them into my personal religious mythology, I don't have the educational background at the moment with which to weigh in on the specifics of the reviewer's arguments. They are quite vituperative in their objections to WATER.

Perhaps there is a certain degree of truth on both opposing sides?

The events as portrayed in WATER occurred 70 + years ago. Certainly the United States, for example, has experienced a near revolutionary reform of race relations from the 1950's onward. I am aware that there remain today extremely backward ""spiritual"" practices in India such as astrology & the Guru racket (not all gurus are confidence tricksters, but many are). Women aren't jumping into the husband's funeral pyre (i.e. suttee) anymore (I hope.) Then there's the artistic aspect: I find abhorrent the politics & twisted mythology of the 1930's Nuremberg Nazi documentary, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL by Nazi enthusiast Leni Riefensthal, but nonetheless I recognize it as a masterpiece and--yes--work of genius. The film's artistic merit transcends its' own propaganda--and I don't mean to equate WATER with racist fascism, but it's always difficult when dealing with diametrically opposed symbolism & belief systems.

Obviously I don't have ready answers to the political & religious objections raised by other reviewers, but I do want them to know that I don't dismiss their concerns, and will look closer into the issues.

In conclusion--and on a much more positive note--the wonderful fusion composer, Mychael Danna, is credited for the softly woven soundtrack of WATER.

If your faith and your conscience are conflicted, it is time to reassess.  Faith should comfort you, not make you turn a blind eye to what you know is wrong.  But out of the tragedy that results from their ancient religious laws comes the resiliency of the human spirit, the innocence of youth, and the blindness of love.

I was delighted with the images, landscapes, actors, dialogues, but at the same time I became more and more indignant as the film went by.

I can't digest this kind of treatment towards women. It really amazes me how so many and different cultures around the world think of women as second class citizens, or worse. As impure, as sinners, as disposable objects. And regardless of the time period this is the current treatment for many women around the world. They get ostracized, shunned or killed based on religious beliefs. And in a less obvious way, but it also happens in modern industrialized countries. Still, the movie is a beautiful piece of art worth watching.

2478249,5,B000E112BG,"Deepa Mehta's ""Water"" is the final part of a trilogy of movies [the other two being ""Fire"" and ""Earth""]. All three explore certain facets of Indian culture and are excellent social commentaries.

In ""Water"", the film is set during the time of British Colonial rule of India, known as the British Raj. The year is 1938, and despite British rule, there is a prevalence of child marriages. Many young girls are married off to much older men, and one such unfortunate is Chuyia [Sarala Kariyawasam]. She is an eight-year-old who has just been widowed and as per the custom of the time, is packed off to a widow's ashram to spend her life expiating her 'sins'. The other motivations for consigning the widows to ashrams is to offset their families' financial responsibilities and also alleviate the social stigma of having a widow in the family [ widows are frequently seen a symbols of bad luck, a perception that has lifted somewhat in contemporary Indian society but not altogether dispelled].

The presiding authority over the ashram is Madhumati {Manorama] an obese and completely ruthless lady who rules over the ashram with the aid of a pimp, Gulabi [Raghuvir yadav],and a eunuch. In order to keep the ashram functioning [apparently donations are insufficient] and Madhumati well-fed, the old witch prostitutes one of the ashram's residents, young widow Kalyani [an ethereally beautiful Lisa Ray]. Because of Kalyani's economic importance, she is the only one of the widows who is allowed to keep her hair [all the others, including young Chuyia have their heads shorn]. Then there is the literate widow [not many of the women can read] Shakuntala [portrayed by the talented Seema Biswas] who is battling her own inner demons. Shakuntala finds it hard to reconcile her devout Hindu beliefs with the fact that she abhors being a widow. Young Chuyia on the other hand, keeps thinking that she will be eventually taken away from the ashram by her mother, having no clue as to how dire her situation really is.

The story gets moving with the introduction of another character, Narayan  [John Abraham], a staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi, and who comes from an affluent and influential family. When Narayan and Kalyani meet, sparks fly but both are very much aware of social taboos which hold them back from each other. Kalyani begins to refuse servicing clients, inciting Madhumati's anger. Narayan finds a way to meet Kalyani and the pair make plans to get away, a secret that Kalyani divulges to Chuyia. The young child accidentally blurts out the secret to Madhumati and this sets the stage for a series of tragic events.

Beautifully filmed, the story serves as a powerful social commentary on the plight of widows in India as set during the late 1930s. Though widows are much better off in contemporary India, their situation is still dire, with lives spent in poverty and under oppression, primarily in the rural areas. With ""Water"", director Mehta has given us a remarkably human story of substance that lingers in one's consciousness long after the credits have rolled.",1245196800,3,3078,4.957364341085271

2478263,5,B000E112BG,"I have been a big admirer of Deepa Mehta's work for some time. Because she is really the only voice that shows the ouside world what is really going on in India. The government of India and also hindu's have been hiding these things and so many others from the outside world. She is the only director willing to show the bad point of hindu society especially with woman. I have a very close connection to this theme because i am also related to India by marriage, and have lived there for years off and on. Also Mehta is the only director to start showing things of hindu society. But for years Bollywood has been showing bad points of muslims in india and 99% aren't true. It is ok for them to do that but if they try to make anything about Hinduism then they try to shut it down.
 Water is a wonderfull showing of the hindu's attitude towards woman. Woman are nothing but property that is bought and sold at marriage, and if they do not give enough money to husband at marry so many times family will burn them.  When husbands die especially if they are young so many times are forced out from their husbands homes because they are considered bad luck. of course not that many hindu's follow  this idea of putting woman in ashrams. but it still happens today, and they do end up into a life of prostitution as it shows in this movie. Actually this movie shows you a more tammer side of what happens to widows in india. They used to actually throw woman into their husbands funeral piers by force.
  This movie has a wonderfull story line and also lesson about what is actually going on and outsiders have no idea. The acting was good but it would have been alot better if the original cast of Shabana Azmi playing the lead. But unfortunatly the indian government forced them to shut down filming in India and also forced Shabana Azmi out of the film. So if she would have been in it then it would have been the best acting. Next I think Deepa Mehta needs to show about abortion in india, and how many hindu babies are being aborted by their parents just because they are girls. Woman being forced to have abortion even if they don't want. Also how much india's population is going uneven with more boys then girls. In some places as much as 30% girls to 70% boys.
  But I advise anyone who wants to see some reality that is going on under wraps, then you need to see every one of Deepa Mehta's movies. I find they will be a big awaking to those who are not familier with indian society.",1219968000,,2488,4.314775160599572
2478264,5,B000E112BG,"I didn't really know what to expect about ""Water"" except that it was an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film (generally a good category for ""sleepers"").  It didn't take long before I got drawn into the story and, especially, the characters.  The picture takes place in 1938 India and Ghandi was a sort of supporting role in formulating the plot.  We start the movie by witnessing a young girl (we're talking somewhere around 7-9 years old) finding out she's a widow.  We then find out that widows in the Indian culture are doomed to live their live in a sort of impoverished pennance while being banned from remarriage.  Our young girl is condemned to a sort of halfway house for widows.  Some of the widows have been that way since the age of our heroine only now they are middle-aged.  They have to fend for themselves which involves begging and more intimate pursuits.  Our girl refuses to accept things the way they are and it is her agitation that creates a new attitude in the ranks of her elders.  There are many facets of this theme played out in ""Water"" utilizing the many unique characters in the story.  In the end, we are left with a modern-day perspective of a problem I (and, I suspect, most viewers) were innocently ignorant of.

This is a quality film which impressed me on virtually all levels.  The cinematography was outstanding, the sound was terrific with the Indian music weaving in and out of the background, the acting was supurb, and the directing was excellent.

2478265,5,B000E112BG,"Courageous and feminist film from Deepa Mehta about women in India who are widows.  Although based in the distant past (1938) when Ghandi was rising to power in his peaceful resistance to the British occupation there, film concludes in its postscriipt that in present times, there are almost 32 million widows in India today living under similar circumstances. Film is focused on the young 7-year old girl who arrives to ashram when her husband passes away.  Since she was promised to him since her birth, regardless of the fact that their marriage was not consummated, she is banished forever from her own and her husband's family into an ashram where other widows reside.  These women of all ages and social classes coexist together trying to find purpose in their new envirinment. When they are not cooking, cleaning or mending, they are praying or begging on the streets in order to pay the rent for their lodgings. Their income is meager and in most cases they obtain their food from  money paid for services from Brahmins who get young widows procured to them in secret of the night.  There is an underlying message here about the society of women who are promised into marriage at birth and have no change of ever learning how to read or obtain a trade that would allow the to earn decent living if there husband is no longer around to provide for them.  They are deprived of ever having family, or remarriage.  The customs say that woman can be cremated at the time of her husband death (burnt alove), sent to ashram for the rest of her life to live in penitence that will honor her departed husband, or with permission of the family marry her husband's younger brother.  The traditional laws seem to overrule social laws created by the forward thinking progressive intellectuals.  Forced protitution, pedofilia and general expoitation of these women is completely hearbreaking.  Their only way out of it is death - natural or suicide - or miracle of any man wanting to marry them if they are still young and pretty enough.  Feminist movie, that will get one thinking for  a long time about women's (social) places in rural societies, or societies where religious tradition outweights all others.",1213315200,,2204,4.816976127320955

  This film really surprised me.  I was expecting a good movie with good cinematography, good music and a good story.  Well, 'Water' was all of those things.  But it turned out to be so much more in a way that you really need to see for yourself.
  Well, the cinamatography and music are not just good - they are fabulous.  The cast, made up of actors I had never even heard of (besides John Abraham, a popular Bollywood actor)act wonderfully and are all perfect for this film.  Aside from perhaps 'Rang de Basanti' I have never seen such a talented ensemble cast in an Indian film.  I was especially moved by the beautiful Lisa Ray's performance as Kalyani.
  The only criticism I have for this movie (and this is nitpicking here) is what I felt was lack of screentime for Seema Biswas, who plays Shakuntala.  Other reviewers on here praise her performance as the good-hearted and conflicted widow.  I agree that she is excellent in her role, especially in the final scene, but I feel more time could have been put into developing her character.

2478291,5,B000E112BG,"I can't remember the last time I saw an Indian film of such beauty and stillness. Stillness - that's the word which kept coming to my mind from time to time, as the languid, long shots slowly wove together the delicate storyline. I felt silenced and humbled, and Water overwhelmed me completely, but in a beautiful way that I shall not forget for a while.

Water tells the story of the pain and suffering that Hindu widows have had to suffer for time memorial due to oftentimes unfair diktats of their religious scriptures. The movie is set in the days of the British Raj, when the mindsets of the masses were still more or less firmly rooted in the past, and widows really had only one of three choices according to the Hindu religion: to burn themselves alive on their husband's pyre (""Sati""); to give up all material possessions and live completely frugally within a sisterhood of widows, or; in special circumstances, to marry the younger brother of the husband. This movie's plot revolves around three women in an ""ashram"" for widows on the banks of the holy river Ganga: one a young girl in her single-digit years who is widowed and sent to the ashram (played by Sarala), another a beautiful widow who is forced into providing the livelihood for the ashram by providing carnal pleasures to the local rich (Lisa Ray), and the third a woman who though not the head of the ashram, is in many ways the sense and strength of the ashram (Seema Biswas). The lives of these three women have become more or less settled in a groove, till a disruptive force appears in their midst in the form of a newly-turned Gandhian who wants to marry Lisa.

To avoid any spoilers, I won't say much more directly about the plot. Instead let me just focus on other aspects of the film, and the feelings it evoked in me. The film has been well thought through in terms of the soundness of its story and the unrelenting hammering of its key message - the ludicrous blinding of faith and its infinite capacity for harm. The plot is highly predictable, but simple and effective, and the predictability does not detract from the film overall. Giles Nuttgens does a first rate job with the camera, creating beautiful and haunting images reminiscent in quality of Christopher Doyle's work in ""In the Mood for Love"". The music is effective, though Rahman could have done better.

The acting deserves a separate paragraph altogether, so here goes: let me start by saying that even though I understand Deepa Mehta's desire to bridge ""art"" cinema with mainstream cinema, I still can't fathom how she manages to cast so terribly from the mainstream sometimes. Lisa Ray and John Abraham? OH GOD, GIVE US A BREAK! I love Lisa Ray's beauty, but can she act? And John? The result is that the acting in this movie is of two types: the outstanding, and the trash. The trash would be obvious by now, so let's talk about the other category. Sarala, in the role of Chuhiya, is a find. It never ceases to amaze me how children can be made to act at this level, but I guess some of them are just naturally gifted. The woman who steals the show however, is Seema Biswas, who delivers the performance of her life. She's done great work before, but nothing is even remotely comparable. I rate her performance in this film among the best I have ever seen on cinema - up there with Emily Watson's performance in ""Breaking the Waves"" and Gena Rowlands in ""A Woman Under the Influence"".

Finally, Deepa does a brilliant job of bringing it all together, and while she was already a good director, I think she has truly arrived as a top-notch director on the global scene with this film.

Do watch the film - you won't regret it.",1175299200,5,3679,4.568181818181818
2478292,3,B000E112BG,"The story doesn't make sense, but it isn't the focus of the movie. THE FOCUS is to show the costumes, put the screen full of colors and this part is well done.

The story is poor, boring, predictable.",1174780800,,343,4.622950819672131
2478293,5,B000E112BG,"You really should view Mehta's three films that make up the trilogy in order.  With Earth she covers the carnage, brutality and massacres of the Indian civil war that broke out at the state of Independence from Britain.  Fire covers sexual politics and is an incredibly brave film which is taboo shattering for Indian audiences. With ""Water"" Mehta has created a masterpiece.  You cannot sit and watch this film without feeling the pain of the discarded Hindu widows.  The little child that does not even know she has been married is forced into a secluded and highly restrictive life, made to feel little higher in society than a leper.  Looked down upon by other Hindus with a disdain that is imbued with hatred, these poor women must fend for themselves till death.

Of course Mehta is outraged that India remains so hidebound to traditions that are anti-life.  This movie caused a sensation in India when she tried to film it there.  At the outset she had been given permission, the script had been vetted, the actors selected, sets built.  Then came the backlash of vile innuendo spread by the BJP in the press.  Not knowing any better, people gathered at the film set, protested and then trashed the set, causing a distraught and shocked Mehta to exit India.  The film remained on the shelf, she did more films and then miraculously raised the budget all over again; this time removed to Sri Lanka with a new cast.

What is miraculous is that looked at now the film seems to be perfect and could not have been improved upon had it been shot earlier.  The cast completely shines from top to bottom.  The young girl chosen to play the child widow was a Sri Lankan and Hindi was not a language she knew.  Instead of shirking from this, Mehta worked with her and the little girl spoke her lines phonetically; as a non-Hindi speaker I could not have detected anything.  She is a perfectly natural actress and her portrayal is very powerful.

This is a very heartbreaking film and you simply cannot see it without feeling grief and yet at the very end, hope.  As of early 2007 the film has yet to play in India although I hear that plans for it's premier are for later this year.  I'll believe it when I read of it.

A young Indian girl is widowed at the age of eight and moved to the house of widows to mourn for her husband's death the rest of her life. But this young girl begins to question the reasons for this mourning, creating quite a stir in the fundamentalist Hindu women.

Although the cinematography is beautiful, the story moving, and the story of the film's creation a story of perseverance in itself, Water is lacking something to really move the plot along. It's just a rather slow film. If you're a very patient viewer who exults in slowly developed characters (don't confuse that for slowly developing character arcs, because unfortunately the characters are rather two dimensional), then you will likely enjoy this film, otherwise I think viewers will find themselves getting a bit bored.

Not that the topic of the film is at all boring, in fact, it's wonderful to see such a socially conscious film being made, and watching the behind the scenes featurette and ""the making of"" featurette on the DVD really shows you how violently fundamentalist Hindus reacted to the production of this film. The production was delayed five years, completely recast, and moved from India to Sri Lanka. It's amazing that Deepa Mehta got this film made, and you can tell from the interviews on the DVD and from the film itself that it has a very special place in her heart.

My point is that men and woman are created differently and if there isn't something to clarify that difference and to explain it, there will be problems.  Widows are looked upon differently in cultures. Some are respected and some are looked down upon. We need to follow our hearts and do what is right, regardless of what the social laws say.

A Great Movie with Flaws.

No motion picture is ever perfect, I suppose, though some come awfully close.  This one doesn't come all that close, but it has great impact and deserves it's high-flying reputation.

To get the low points out of the way quickly: 1. The movie is too 'preachy,' and that sometimes gets in the way of the story-telling.  2. The story-telling style is inconsistent, sometimes giving the plot to us in a sort of mental slow motion with numbing amounts of detail, and at other times, jumping ahead, or into and out of fantasy, with almost no clues at all to things we are evidently supposed to guess at.  3. The little girl who plays the role of catalyst in this story of cultural challenge and change is much too aware of the camera.  She's cute, and at times very effective, but you can almost hear the director telling her what to do, how to look, which way to turn, how to utter the phrase, when to cry, when to laugh.  She seldom manages to seem 'natural.'  4. The lead adult female role is seriously miscast.  Lisa Ray doesn't look at all Indian, she's far too beautiful to be believable in this setting, and her portrayal of her character is disappointingly shallow.  5. One plot point involving a necessary 'coincidence' in particular stretches believability to the breaking point.

BUT . . .

But in spite of those flaws, I give this movie and its DVD the full 5 stars.  [Four and a half, in my mind, but I rounded up.]

A seven-year-old widow [not eight as some reviews and interviews have suggested] is exiled to life in an Ashram-- a sort of halfway house for the legally dead.  As is explained in the movie itself, a widow in 1938 India has three choices: (a) she can throw herself onto her husband's funeral pyre, (b) she can marry his younger brother, if there is one, and if he wishes it, (c) she can live the rest of her life dressed in the solid white of death shrouds, with no color in her life, one meal a day, and no chance, ever, to be a functioning part of her society.

Except that his particular ashram has a director, herself a widow, who has capitalized on the extreme beauty of one of her inmates-- a young woman who was widowed at age 9 and who is now rented out as a sort of Call Girl of Death for the sexual entertainment of wealthy middle-aged 'clients.'  And this young woman meets a handsome young man about her age, and . . . well, you can guess the rest.

And thereby hangs the plot.  I will not give away anything other than to say that this movie is a tragedy, but it is not at all predictable, and with the one major exception already mentioned seems entirely believable.

So far so good, but there are some 'extras' that lift this film above the commonplace and bring it close to being a masterpiece.  I'll list these elements.

First, and perhaps most importantly, the cinematography is breathtaking.  Remember 'Picnic'?  This one goes the night scenes in that earlier movie one better.  That one had electric lightbulbs inside paper lanterns.  This one has several night scenes in which the only lighting is indirect, and even then is provided by candles, and they are magical!  The daylight scenes are just as lovingly photographed, and the title element is exploited wonderfully.

Second, the inclusion of Ghandi himself [first via voice recordings, then in person] in the plot line is a stroke of genius.  Doing so shows how traditional patriarchal Hindu culture, very much alive still today, had even then already begun to abandon one of its hero's prime points of philosophy.

Third, the musical score by one of my all-time favorites, Mychael Danna, is evocative without being slavishly true to the subject matter and setting.  The flute tune during the opening titles, although a bit too Western in harmonic usage, grows over the course of the movie to provide powerfully moving musical undercurrents to the story, done as only Danna can do it.  [Remember 'The Sweet Hereafter'?]

Fourth, the use of almost violent color in one fantasy scene comes as a powerful reminder of the deprivation (of so many kinds) that these poor widows are forced to live in, if you can call it living.

I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  This movie will live with me for a long, long time.  The flaws bring it down below the level of ultimate greatness, but the total impact the movie has ensures that it is powerful, moving, and memorable.",1167868800,2,4407,4.554002541296061

2478324,5,B000E112BG,"Water is far too powerful and moving to be called a mere film; this is a brave cinematic triumph that illuminates a tragic issue that few in the West know the first thing about - namely, the historical plight of widows in Hindu society.  It also has much to say about modern Hindu culture as well, though, as the mistreatment of widows is still a problem in India today - and quite a touchy one, as made clear by the reaction of Hindu fundamentalist groups in India during filming.  As I watched the end credits of the film roll, I was a little puzzled as to why the movie was shot in Sri Lanka, but now I have learned that the original production was basically run out of Upper Pradesh, India, because it was attacked as anti-Hindu in nature.  It took four years for the filming to be taken up again - this time outside of India, with the two lead roles played by one actress who only spoke Hindi as a second language (Lisa Ray) and another who spoke no Hindi whatsoever before filming began (Sarala).  Obviously, the subject matter makes for a most touchy issue; Hinduism is the world's oldest religion, so we're talking about traditions ingrained into much of the population for thousands of years.

I first became fascinated with India a little over a year ago, and I found this film to be nothing short of shocking, exposing a part of Hindu culture I knew nothing about.  I knew that widows had to give up their own lives in the funeral pyres of their dead husbands many centuries ago, but I had no idea that widows still gave up the majority of their lives here in the modern day.  It is heartening to discover that Gandhi opposed this traditional practice.  This great man was about much more than peaceful opposition to British colonialists and the elimination of the caste system - and widows were basically an anonymous cast unto themselves, separated and shunned by society.  It's especially tragic to see a young and vibrant life essentially snuffed out by this practice - and it's doubly tragic that so many of these women did not question it, as they had been brought up to believe they deserved to be punished for not dying when their husbands died.  It's even more especially tragic when such widows included little girls.

Chuyia (Sarala) is one such girl, widowed at seven years old.  She accepts the ritualistic shaving of her head to indicate her widowhood, but she is far too young to understand why her parents abandoned her, leaving her in the care of a group of widows forced to live outside of normal society for the rest of their lives.  Initially rebelling against her new position in life, she finds only one kind soul, a beautiful young lady named Kalyani (Lisa Ray).  Kalyani lives somewhat apart from her fellow widows; she has a dog (which is forbidden) and she also still has long hair - but only because the dominant widow forces her into prostitution.  Kalyani soon meets a young man named Narayan (John Abraham), a modern thinker and follower of Gandhi.  They fall in love, and Narayan (to his mother's horror) asks her to marry him.  That sets even more dramatic events in motion, leading up to a conclusion that will more than likely have you in tears.

As you may have guessed, this is a pretty depressing film, with a number of very uncomfortable, heart-breaking scenes.  Your heart just goes out to so many of these widows, from the outrageously young, such as Chuyia, to the very old (such as Auntie, who has spent the better part of a century dreaming about the sweets she has been unable to taste since the time of her own childhood wedding).  Amidst so much hopelessness, however, there is a modicum of hope embodied in one very religious woman (Seema Biswas) who begins to question the values she has always believed in - and in the end there is also Gandhi, who has returned to his native land and just been released from prison by the British (Water is set in 1938).

I really wish I could convey to you the raw power and emotion of this extraordinary film.  The story is woven together in a masterly way, evoking almost infinite meaning from so many small incidents and events, and on a surprisingly large number of issues.  The cinematography and sparsely effective musical score simply soar, and the performances of the entire cast could not be more impressive.  I don't know if I've ever seen a film express so much meaning so effectively.  Water is just a magnificent cinematic achievement.",1164844800,12,4443,4.6078680203045685

The movie takes an intimate story, of the little girl-widow and the people around her, to become a microcosm of the reality of India at the time Ghandi and independance from the British. The whole movie then acts as a metaphor of India as a new independant nation (in the western sense of the world); a confrontation of tradition vs the modernity that the country is confronting, and how that battle will affect the lives of its inhabitants, to the smallest of them.

The end scene is one of the most moving i have seen in any other pictures before. One of those rare films that reafirms the realization that the reality of a nation is reflected in the everyday reality of its people. HIghly recommended.",1161648000,3,859,4.61437908496732
2478326,5,B000E112BG,"This is an absolutely stunning movie.  It is gorgeously photographed which helps to offset the somewhat somber nature of the story.  Have a box of Kleenix handy as this is an emotionally powerful movie.  Those fundamentalists who threatened the life of the director and destroyed the sets and ultimately forced the movie out of India should be ashamed of themselves.  I suppose they were upset because the movie exposed the harsh truth of how widows were treated in India (and perhaps some who still are treated this way).  Sometimes the truth hurts and I think those who protested and fought against this movie do not truly believe that their treatment of widows is right and proper.  If they did honestly believe it, they would have no problem at all with the movie which portrays it as it was (and perhaps still is, in some cases).  They would have no shame if they truly believed they were right and just.  Obviously they don't believe it is right, so it is something that must be hidden; a deep dark secret that makes them look bad.  The interesting thing is that their protests probably made this movie better known than it would have been otherwise.  Instead of keeping it from being made, they strengthened the resolve of the director to make this movie, as well as bringing more attention to it.  I honestly don't think this movie is in any way detrimental to the religion or to the perception that people have of India.  Would anyone get upset if a movie was made about the injustices that America perpetrated on black slaves or native Americans in our past (and sometimes even now)? That's doubtful. How is this any different?; it is set in the 30's, after all.  Things have changed a lot since then in India, as they have in America and many countries.  It's pathetic the way women are treated in some parts of the world.  In many ways, India has changed for the better and is continuing to change, but there are still places in India where (sadly) it is hell to be a woman.",1158624000,6,1986,4.570621468926554
2478327,3,B000E112BG,"Several reviews have already described the plot and details behind the making of this film, so I won't repeat that.  I did want to mention something that may not be as readily apparent to most American viewers but that seems important for an appreciation of this film.

One reader compared this film to the realism of ""Pather Panchali"" and I agree with another that the similarities between these films are superficial: the ""auntie"" character in both films are similar, they both work by focusing on the lives of a few set against the backdrop of major changes in India that affect their lives.  Where the films differ is that in Pather Panchali, Satyaajit Ray was attempting (and was remarkably successful) to bring to his own country a style of poetic realism he learned from European directors and most notably from Renoir.  In this film, Deepa Mehta appears to be attempting to adapt mainstream Bollywood style to the problem of conveying realistically the problems inherited from a rigid interpretation of religious traditions.  In this she is also remarkably successful.  Some have complained in these reviews of a melodramatic and emotionally charged feel to the film -- but what is missed is that this style is characteristic of mainstream ""Bollywood"" filmmaking, and the director has been able to adapt this style to her own purposes, which suggests that her primary intended audience is in India.  What I found most interesting was the way she adapted the traditional musical numbers in Bollywood films, including them while making them much more plausible than in the standard Bollywood musicals.  In such films, emotions of the characters are expressed through highly stylized musical sequences, in which the main characters dance and sing to express their love for one another or jealousy or fear or sorrow.  In this film, the numbers were toned down, and the emotion was carried by the song, while the characters adopted poses or activities that suggested their emotional state without explicitly bursting into song.

""Water"" is beautifully shot with a very effective cast.  At great odds and against the backdrop of persecution and opposition by fundamentalists, the film successfully brings attention to the traditional (and to some extent still continuing) plight of widows in India.  Moreover, it effectively employs a style of filmmaking that would both be accessible to non-Indian viewers and that at the same time respects and honors the great tradition of mainstream Indian filmmaking.  Definitely worth seeing.",1158019200,15,2533,5.178921568627451
2478328,5,B000E112BG,"This sad statement is the core of the film's message about the reason for the sequestration of widows from Indian society.  The Hindu religion states that a woman is half her husband and when she becomes a widow (no matter the age - many children are married to very old men) she must live a chaste life without the joys of the world, becoming a virtual begging outcast.  But despite this 'religious' reason for sending the thousands of widows into seclusion in the city of Varanasi, the apparent true reason is to not have them take up space and money in the homes of the deceased!

WATER is Deepa Mehta's masterpiece of writing and directing, creating a film of such extraordinary beauty and sensitivity despite all plots to keep her from turning her 'anti-Hindu' story into  a movie for public consumption.  Years of frustration preceded the final product, a film that had to be shot in Sri Lanka to avoid the crowds of protestors in Mehta's beloved India.  The story is simple yet profound: Chuyia (Sarala) is an 8-year old girl married to an elderly man in an event she doesn't even remember.  But as a new widow her father takes her to an ashram in Varanasi where her head is shaved and she wears a colorless sari and must live with the other outcast widows.  She is befriended by the religious and kind Shakuntala (Seema Biswas) who attempts to protect her from the forces that make life difficult and by  Kalyani (the stunning model turned fine actress Lisa Ray) who befriends her, shares her puppy and her secrets, and in the end helps Chuyia understand the injustices of the custom of isolating widows.  Kalyani is 'farmed out' by eunuch procurer Galabi (Raghuvir Yadav) to keep her humanness alive.  But a handsome commoner and follower of Gandhi (the year is 1938), Narayan (John Abraham), is struck by both Chuyia and Kalyani and falls in love with Kalyani, a love that is never to be realized in marriage for reasons unveiled in the story.  At film's end there is a sense of hope for the widows as introduced by the rise of Gandhi and his philosophy and the film's closing is immensely touching.

Mehta knows how to tell her story well and is not only supported by a strong cast but also by a fine production crew: the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens is incandescently moody and gloriously beautiful and the original music by Mychael Danna and A.R. Rahman blends Indian songs with Western orchestral writing in a perfect union that works well with the story.  This is one of those films that not only stands alone as a strikingly beautiful creation, but it is also a film that informs us about other cultural patterns about which most of us are ignorant.  It is a masterpiece on every level, a film to add to your library along with the other two parts of Mehta's trilogy - Fire and Earth.  Grady Harp, September 06",1157846400,12,2830,4.6187624750499

The importance of Ghandi and the changing times in India also play a significant part in this movie, but again, at the root, this movie is about personal beliefs against those of a whole society.

Written and directed by Deepa Mehta, WATER is the third in her ""elemental trilogy,"" having been preceded by EARTH and FIRE. I had seen neither before watching the DVD of WATER, so don't worry, you don't need to know the other stories to know what's happening in this one. You're probably going to want to go back and watch the others just because WATER was so good, though. I know I have put them at the top of my rental queue.

WATER is set in India during the 1930s. Gandhi is starting to gain notoriety and his progressive ideas are sweeping over a nation that has spent too much time under foreign rule. That is merely a backdrop, however, an indication of a larger social milieu. The real story is in an ashram where widows live the remainder of their lives in a state of denial, compelled by Hinduism to abandon the material world at the same time their husbands did. Only, since they are still alive, they have to do so by renouncing their very existence. Heads shaved, allowed only one meal a day, and forbidden from any extended contact with men, they live a meager existence together in their own pocket culture.

The film opens when eight-year-old Chuyia (played by Sarala) is informed that her husband has died. Not even old enough to realize that she had been married, Chuyia is in a state of confusion when she is shuffled off to the widows' ashram. She rebels and fantasizes about escaping. Eventually, she settles in, befriending the beautiful Kalyani (Lisa Ray), who has been forced into prostitution by the rotund ruler of the house, Madhumati (Manorama), in order to provide for the needs of the other widows. Chuyia and Madhumati clash instantly, and it's only thanks to intervention of the calm Shakuntala (Seema Biswas) that the young girl escapes a beating.

The injustice of how the widows live is quite obvious, and Mehta doesn't have to overdo it to make us see her point. She deliberately sets the movie at a time of cultural change in India, because it gives her a convenient platform to illustrate this bizarre situation. The three generations of women--Chuyia, Kalyani, and Shakuntala--represent three tiers of belief. The youngest does not yet know what is in store for her, whereas the older is completely resigned to her fate. It's only the middle woman, Kalyani, who is aware of both sides, and who can temper the hope of the child with the wisdom of age. The handsome and sensitive Narayan represents the progressive mind of India. He is willing to buck his mother's desires for him to marry within his class, smitten as he is with Kalyani. A student of Gandhi, Narayan is also an aficionado of romantic poetry, imagining himself as a warrior in an epic battle for love. He's going to marry Kalyani, and he's not afraid of the consequences.

Naturally, changes of this kind do come with consequences, and none of the women are unaffected. Shakuntala is goes through the deepest transformation, and the fate of the child is placed on her back. All the actors are great, but Biswas has the most work to do. The gradual erosion of her resolve could have been overwrought, but she makes the inner conflict feel real. It's largely down to her that the ending works. Once again, in less capable hands, the final scenes could have been schmaltzy, but Mehta is not interested in a complete triumph. She has written a story where good things happen, but with the appropriate price.

Just as complex as the social issues is Mehta's approach to the various images of water in the movie. She is not content to establish one metaphor for the element, but to look at all of its uses. It might be cleansing and life giving, but it can also take away. It can ferry us to a new life or to our own destruction. The most romantic use of water imagery, however, is when Narayan is alone with Kalyani and he recites a verse about how rain clouds are the messengers of the heavens. Thus, his failure to see an oncoming storm also becomes all the more ironic.

Even if WATER didn't have such an involving story, it would be worth watching just to look at it. Mehta and her director of photography, Giles Nuttgens (YOUNG ADAM), are clearly enamored of India. The city streets are lovingly shot, the details of the people and their surroundings orchestrated down to the smallest detail. This means they also don't shy away from the squalor, which provides an excellent contrast to the gorgeous nature shots. The ones centered around water are particularly beautiful.

WATER isn't just an exceptional movie, but it's also an exceptional DVD. In addition to a commentary by Deepa Mehta, there are two featurettes on the making of the movie. A lot of preparation went into getting the historical and cultural details of the movie correct, but there was also a behind-the-scenes struggle to get the movie made that is just as interesting as the final product. Faced with opposition from religious fundamentalists who misconstrued Mehta's intentions, the production was shut down before it started, and it took Mehta several years to get it going again. When she did, she had to shoot in Sri Lanka instead of India. For a film about the gradual change of religious politics set over sixty years ago, the battle against Water is a grim reminder that we're still faced with such problems today.",1157500800,12,5716,4.7032967032967035
2478341,5,B000E112BG,"""Water"" is the third film in writer/director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy, following ""Fire"" and ""Earth"". It explores the plight of widows in traditional Hindu culture, where women are condemned to a grim, rudimentary existence after their husbands die. Driven by characters as much as by its cause, this is not a bleak film. On the contrary, ""Water"" is breathtakingly beautiful. In India in 1938, young Chuyia (Sarala) is widowed at the age of 8. By religious law, when a man dies, his wife may either be cremated with him, marry his brother, or live the life of an ascetic -chaste, poor, and pious. Chuyia's head is shaved, her jewelry removed, and she is sent to live in an ashram with other widows of all ages. She is befriended by a pretty widow named Kalyani (Lisa Ray), watched over by the devout and generous Shakuntula (Seema Biswas), and often at odds with the ashram's callous matriarch Madhumati (Manorama), who pays the rent by prostituting Kalyani. A handsome law student with progressive politics, Narayan (John Abraham), is smitten by Kalyani. But it is sinful for widows to remarry, and Kalyani is a prostitute besides.

The story of making ""Water"" is a drama in itself. Filming in India in 2000 was shut down by violent protests by religious fundamentalists, who believed the film was anti-Hindu. Deepa Mehta's view is that a misinterpretation of religious texts has perpetuated the dreadful state of widows in Indian culture, which is actually the result of economics. If a widow is sent away upon the death of her husband, her own family does not have to pay to feed or house her, and her would-be inheritance remains in her husband's family. In any case, there were riots, Deepa Mehta was burned in effigy, and the film's sets were thrown into the river. Four years later, the film was recast and the production moved to Sri Lanka, where filming began again. All of the temples and buildings that you see are sets by production designer Dilip Mehta. Sarala, who plays Chuyia, is Sri Lankan and does not speak a word of Hindi. She learned all of her lines phonetically. Somehow that doesn't even seem odd amid this international cast and creative crew.

Giles Nuttgens' cinematography is a force in this film. Everything appears so alive and luminous that I wanted to step into this world to be bathed in its beautiful light and touch its delicate features. The light has a striking purity. The film's score by Canadian Mychael Danna and songs by Indian composer A.R. Rahman are an ideal auditory accompaniment to ""Water""'s visual splendor. Although it focuses our attention on the plight of widows in India, ""Water"" is not a realistic film on the narrative level. Kalyani and Narayan are idealized characters. She is pure, lovely, and suffering. He educated, and socially progressive. To Narayan, Kalyani is a romantic figure, a fragile, innocent soul in need of rescuing. The idea that a wealthy, educated man would want to marry an illiterate peasant prostitute who will never understand his causes or his world view seems far-fetched. But Kalyani's reticence and Narayan's sensitivity draw us in. Narayan is a change of pace for John Abraham, who is an Indian supermodel and Bollywood star. Lisa Ray is Canadian, also a supermodel in India, but Hindi is not her first language. Director Deepa Mehta has a real talent for casting the perfect actors from seemingly unlikely choices.

For all of Kalyani and Narayan's beauty and sympathy, ""Water"" is not their film. Shakuntula is the character who has an arc, and Seema Biswas gives the film's great performance. She personifies the conflict between conscience and faith that is at ""Water""'s core. (You many remember Seema Biswas from her lead role in ""Bandit Queen"".)  Manorama, who has acted in an extraordinary 1301 movies, is memorably sharp as the matriarch Madhumati. Professor of Hindi literature Dr. Vidula Javalgekar plays the kindly, sweet-toothed, elderly widow Patiraji, a woman who must be very unlike herself. ""Water"" is simply a gorgeous sensory experience that movie-lovers won't want to miss. In Hindi (and some Sanskrit) with English or Spanish subtitles or English captions.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): ""Behind the Scenes"" (20 min) includes interviews with writer/director Deepa Mehta and the cast. Mehta talks about the controversy surrounding the film and its themes. The actors discuss Mehta's directing style, mastering the period mannerisms, and their characters. ""The Story Behind the Making of Water"" (4 min) is about the controversy and the ill-fated first attempt to film ""Water"". There is a good, continuous audio commentary by Deepa Mehta in which discusses the sets, actors, character development, cinematography and lighting, the film's score, and provides additional information about Indian culture.",1157414400,196,4812,5.078381795195955
2478342,4,B000E112BG,"The story is set in 1938, when Mahatma Gandhi was starting to influence the people of India.  The film opens with a young girl of eight riding in a cart next to a very sick man.  We soon learn that this man is her husband, even though the marriage has not yet been consummated.  The man dies and the little girl is confused as her head is shaved bald and she is forced to put on a white sari.  Then she is taken to a ""house of widows"" where she is expected to live for the rest of her life.  At first she rebels.  But then she makes friends with women, one of whom is in her twenties and has been allowed not to shave her head because she is taken by a boat across the river to service wealthy men.  Another one of the women is in her forties and even though she is a devoted Hindu, she questions the traditions that force widows to live in poverty and not let their shadow fall across that of a married woman.  But the saddest of all is an old woman in her 90s, who has lived in this place since childhood.  Widows are not allowed to eat sweets and can only eat one sparse meal a day, but this old lady only dreams of sweets and talks lovingly about her wedding feast where she had a wonderful time feasting on such treats.  This was many years ago because she, too, was widowed in childhood.

The little girl is a delight and soon she wins the hearts of all the women in the ashram.  She also won my heart.  And I could not help but be saddened by her plight and all her sister widows.  The young woman with the long hair has a romance with a handsome young rich man who is a follower of Gandhi.  It looks as if they can find happiness.  But, alas, that is not to be.  Often, it was hard to watch and I thought a little too much time was spent developing the romance between the couple.  Also, some of the horrors were just repetitive and started to lose their impact.  Basically, though, this is a really fine film.

There was one thing that bothered me, however.  This was the fact that none of these widows had children.  I wanted to know more and spent more than an hour on Google trying to find out what happens to a widow with children.  Does she take them with her to the Ashram?  Does she live in the house with them?  Does she have to leave them behind?  These questions are still unanswered.  It does seem that all of the widows in the film had been child brides with unconsummated relationships.  I was waiting for them to talk about widows with children.  But they never did, which, I think is a weakness of the film.

I definitely recommend ""Water"" to anyone interested in the expanding his or her knowledge of the world's customs.  There is really so much we don't understand.  And, as the film faded to an end, a descriptive sentence on the screen informed us that there are over 34 MILLION widows living in India today.  I can't help wondering how many are still living by the old rules.  It is all so very sad.",1157241600,5,2929,4.162210338680927
2478343,4,B000E112BG,"Water is a beautifully filmed, well-acted, thought-provoking film. Aside from a couple of scenes seemingly in homage to Bollywood, it will move you deeply.

It took five years for the film to be completed due to Hindu fundamentalist groups shutting down the production two days into filming in 2000.

""Breaking up the sets was far too mild an act, the people involved with the film should have been beaten black and blue. They come with foreign money to make a film which shows India in poor light because that is what sells in the West. The West refuses to acknowledge our achievements in any sphere, but is only interested in our snake charmers and child brides. And people like Deepa Mehta pander to them,"" said India's The Week magazine (February 13, 2000).

Same old story - of hating and shattering the sincere mirror held up to our faces.

Water is the final film in Mehta's elemental trilogy (Earth-Fire-Water). Her films are based on elements that have the potential to nurture or destroy, to protect or consume, to be used constructively or otherwise in our lives.

The film's premise is based upon the 2,000 year old Laws of Manu which state that a Hindu wife has only three options upon the death of her husband: She can burn herself alive on his funeral pyre, marry his younger brother, or live the remainder of her life as a widow in self-denial, ostracized from society.

Set in India in 1938 along the River Ganges, the film chronicles the lives of several widows against the backdrop of the rise to prominence of Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent campaign for liberation.

Water is an eloquent protest against the maltreatment of Indian widows, 37 million of whom were recorded in the 2001 Indian census. In the past and present, many of these women were forced to enter ashrams or ""widow houses."" Labeled as worthless without a husband to measure themselves by, they struggled to survive by begging and often turned to prostitution.

At our screening in March, Mehta talked about the widow problem in India: ""It's what the text of Manu says: a woman is half-body of her husband when he is alive, and then when he dies, she becomes half-dead. However, the texts were written by men, interpreted by men, misinterpreted by men.""

Mehta argued that an economic privilege is at play. ""It's all economic, it really is,"" she says. ""It benefits the households and the men if a woman who is a widow is sent away under the guise of religion.""

A widow thus sent has no claim on the family land or wealth and does not need to be fed or clothed.

Mehta made it very clear that she is Hindu, Canadian-Indian, proud of her heritage and determined not to let what she sees as a narrow, patriarchal vision of Hinduism eliminate all other voices.

While not arrogant enough to think her film would transform the condition of the widows on its own, she felt it began a conversation, and that even in the past five years since she started the project the conditions of widows had changed a bit for the better.

I highly recommend seeing this film as a thought-provoking and necessary examination of how man-made interpretations of divine laws become unquestionable and sacred in their own right; the tensions between having a conscience and having faith that arise from these interpretations; and the diffculties women face in reconciling text and practices that often seem to favor men over women.",1156723200,4,3398,4.748726655348047

2478346,4,B000E112BG,"This is a well made film with really good cinematography and interesting characters.  It is a shame that there were those who wanted to ban it and that violence had erupted because of it.  Rather this should be used for discussion of which I feel compelled to participate in.  There are certain choices in the film that can be questioned as misleading of which a quote is given in the beginning that is referring to what is claimed to be ""Hindu scripture.""  Actually what is interesting is that the term ""Hinduism"" is falsely applied as the practices and philosophies are multi-faceted and yet do not apply any form of ""social code"" dictums or dogmas.  The quote is from a book called the Manu Smrti, which though significant to many western academics, is barely insignificant to most Hindus.  It was written quite late, after much of the colonization and is not very known among the majority of practitioners.  In fact Hinduism does not fit with the term ""religion"" in the western/Abrahamistic sense of the word in that it is not have laws for it's practitioners to adhere to.  Instead it gives an abstract term ""dharma"" which is an internal knowledge of the right action for the right time.

But in the end, such practices towards widows did occur in India, though not widespread, and possibly for much different reasons than what is suggested by the film (In a previous film by Mehta, it is suggested that lesbianism ""occurs"" because of poor Hindu marriages rather than is an innate sexual preference).  In actual scripture we find that the foundations of Hinduism is based on nature worship which exemplifies the female energy.  Meanwhile western culture is based on the writings of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle who had very low regards towards women.  Yet we do not focus on these aspects of our culture.

Don't get me wrong, it's beautifully shot and our heroes are just so darned pretty and we really really hope they get together.  But all in all it's a predictable story that pushes some buttons.  Having strong emotions because the director told you to is not the same as discovering those same emotions in the presence of great art.  Seeing the injustice of 12-year-old brides makes me feel sad.  But it's not the same depth of sadness I feel in the pivotal scene in Satyajit Ray's perfect and poetic film.
