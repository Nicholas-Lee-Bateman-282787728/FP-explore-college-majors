218553,3,6300183785,"If these can't be released in video, then Miami Vice is suffering a great injustice.  These 2 episodes were the BEST of the entire series:  ""Smuggler's Blues"" - great Glen Frey audio when the plane is on the deserted runway. ""Brothers in Arms"" - breaking through the sheetrock wall & the phrase ""book him"" when the corpse was unveiled...""but he was my partner..."".  Please make all of Miami Vice available to purchase on video.  There are a lot of die-hards out here who would purchase. Though a cable channel is now showing re-runs, I would prefer to buy clear videos, without commercials. PLEASE!!!",981331200,21,600,4.796116504854369
218554,5,6300183785,"Release the entire series on box set DVDs (One season per box set) and I'll buy every one. For me, It's all or nothing.  This is hopefully going to be the new trend.  The X-files has already released season one and two, and so have a couple of others.  So, come on, there are a lot of us out here.

218555,4,6300183785,"I just got done with watching Miami Vice and it took me back to the '80's again, when everything was all good. ""The Decade Of Excess"", or as it is now so known so affectionately, brought back the old memories.  Cool cars (Ferraris) and even cooler clothes then ( hot pink blazers) were  of the day. Miami is a much different city now than it shows on here, but  if you want to know what Vice was all about, this is the video to get!",955756800,5,432,4.0588235294117645
218556,4,6300183785,"Though it has a great storyline and a very efficient sense of dramatic motion, this first episode still coudn't show everything this series could do or would turn to be. That is, of course, understandable, nobody knows at  this point who were James Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, those characters  would naturally have a deeper approach later. Lieutenant Castillo (Edward  James Olmos) was yet to come. It is nice to see Jan Hammer's Miami Vice  theme still without the guitar melody and extended a bit. Phil Collins'  ""In the Air Tonight"" is one of the highest tension points during  the movie, which has Hammer's ""Chase"" and ""Flashback"",  too. I can't believe that there are only two episodes available, there are  so many other important moments of the series (the coming of the new  Ferrari, the death of Zito, the second marriage of Sonny Crockett and etc).  At first, other 2 hour lenght (or double episodes) could be released, like  ""Hit List"", ""Golden triangle"", ""Down for the  Count"", ""Hostile Takeover"", ""Freefall"". After that  the entire collection should be released. We are talking about an artistic  production famous by its development of a new narrative language (having  the influence of videoclip and making influence in it too), very original  and sophisticated visual textures. And of course, the famous guest stars.  I'm sure a lot of people would like to see again the appearances of James  Brown, Ted Nugent, Charlie Barnett, Phil Collins, Gordon Liddy, Jan Hammer  and SO MANY OTHERS.

218927,5,6300183785,"I was so excited to see that my favorite show had made it to Blu-ray. Seeing as how its a show from the 80's, my expectations were not that high, but damn if they didn't screw the pooch on this one. If you don't have surround sound and are happy with regular stereo sound, you should find these to be pretty good. If instead you were hoping to listen to these in the advertised 5.1 surround sound...run...run away as fast as you can and do not buy this set. I read other posts were they claimed to have fixed the issues, but it sounds horrible and is out of sync. At times you can hear what can only be described as a digital echo or hum along with weird feedback. Sounds like a phonecall made to Europe during the 80's...delay and echo. If they do indeed have newer versions of these discs that fix the sound issues, I would love to get a set. I would be willing to update my review, but based on what I purchased I would stay far away from this garbage set.

UPDATE: 3/15/18

After I posted my review, I sent an email to Mill Creek and told them how bad the sound was and how disappointed I was with their product. They responded within an hour and promised to send out replacement discs. The discs arrived today (along with a free movie) and I decided to change my review from 1 star to 5 stars. Great customer service and the new discs sound much better and the sync is spot on.",1520467200,4,1382,4.1722846441947565

218930,1,6300183785,"Absolutely terrible! In some cases you get what you pay for, not this. I'm watching it on a new not cheap (I don't know if you can say brands on here) TV using HDMI hookups, with a very good sound bar. The quality is so substandard it reminds me of watching an old VHS tape on the lowest record setting (If you're old like me, you'll know what I'm talking about). The picture is so dark and grainy, even after adjusting the picture to get it at least watchable, some scenes you can barely see what's going on. The sound is the same, terrible. Lastly is the packaging, completely useless. They would have been better off using one of those bulk plastic tubes. I know companies have to pay for the rights to reproduce movies, shows, etc, so I understand there are costs involved, however, I'm guessing this set is being produced in China for pennies. I would return it, but since I started watching it, I don't think that would be right, plus they would probably repackage it and send it to someone else.",1519862400,4,1002,4.421621621621622

219071,5,6300183785,"Ground-breaking series that changed the face of television forever. The first two seasons were the best, filled with classic episodes you can watch over and over without getting bored. Toward the end of the series, Michael Mann stepped aside, and his vision went with him. The show lost its sense of humor and became too obsessively ""dark"" in tone. All in all, a classic study of how one man's vision can remake a whole genre, and what happens to that vision when the original creator loses interest. Still well worth the purchase price.",1516924800,,537,4.78494623655914

Two Audio choices  Standard Stereo or Surround Sound I do not have Surround sound and so far I have found no issues with quality or up/down volume or misdubb.
Picture quality given the originals are almost 30 year tech they won't be blu rey quality however this is  the limitations of tech. if you get real close you can see some grain and pixel however at a normal  viewing distance 5ft or more  it was better than I thought on a 55' flat screen.
You will have black bars on the sides but that is a limitation of the original format overall I am very pleased with the quality and happy to have an updated set my last DVDs were wore out...It seems the previous issues were addressed good packaging good quality with what they had to work with.",1515888000,,905,4.3

drawbacks: Season Five disc have stops and stutters.. the cardboard sleeves it comes in.. they will do the job if you are careful with them.

I received the updated corrected disks with the serial numbers on the case spines of season 1 and 4, and the serial numbers in fine print under the Disk Number on S-1, Disk-1 and Disk-4, and S-4, Disk-4.
Have only had time to watch season-1 and season-4.  No audio problems at all. BUT S-1, Disk-1, Episode-1 ""Brothers Keeper"" had two spots where the video would stop, pixelate, and skip a few minutes then resume playing.  No visible problem on the disk and cleaned it twice, but same trouble at both spots.
Contacted Lyle Goff at ""Mill Creek"" and he sent me a replacement disk which arrived quickly and plays with no problems.
Kudos to Mill Creek for their customer service.
If I come across any trouble with the rest of the series disks, I will update this review.

I heard warnings about the sound and such and the DVD would be better. My reason for getting the blue ray was mainly because I've purchased other DVD sets from mill creek entertainment and they are not neat and in cases always (I experienced this with the party of five complete season). I saw photos of what the DVD looked like and it looked similar and so I preferred with the blue ray since the discs weren't a cluster and in cases! Highly addicting, some episodes are a bit slow and boring but good for winding down and making you sleepy, and some make you want to be in a time machine, what I would do for a white tesslarosa!",1500076800,2,787,4.184210526315789
219396,1,6300183785,"I would have to say this version is not as well done as the one released by universal 10 years ago.  First, I am very unhappy with it being in 4:3 verses full screen, and I know it was originally in 4:3 and remember watching it on a little tube set but universal made it full screen for their release but also used double sided discs too.  I am glad that they at lease used 5.1 master hd but it was already put in 5.1 by universal anyway.  Netflix also had in 4:3 and they did not even use the real sound track which this version used just like the universal version did.  The video quality is as good as can be expected it was originally in 480i and that can never be changed and only upsampled which can only do so much good and really varies by how it was shot and maintained from the original material.  I would have to say the biggest issue is double stacking dvd's which is cheap and stupid and yes those little swinging double sided holders break but if they used four of those little slim case that hold two discs each it would have been better.",1499904000,,1053,4.142156862745098

219488,5,6300183785,"Miami Vice is one my all time favorite shows and I was excited to see it come out on Blu-ray; I had been waiting for it for a long time. Miami Vice Blu-ray released by Mill Creek Entertainment is actually not as bad as it is on the reviews here. I own hundreds of Blu-ray titles and I also own all 5 seasons of Miami Vice on standard DVD so I think my review will be fair.

I just finished watching the season 1 disc 1. Blu-ray picture quality is excellent. People who complain about the picture quality may not have the best TV or the eye-sight. I cannot imagine a better picture quality than what is presented here. There are just a couple of scenes where the picture gets extremely grainy but they do not last very long (only about 5 seconds) and the picture goes back to crystal clear HD quality quickly. I will have to watch the standard DVD to compare those scenes; I wonder if they are also present on the standard DVD edition.

Audio: I have selected 5.1 and I have not experienced any of the audio problems that are mentioned although I had contacted Mill Creek Entertainment by email and asked for replacement discs even before I started watching the Blu-ray discs. They responsed the next day and said that I would receive the replacement discs in 5-6 weeks, I actually received them in just 4 days. I do think some of the audio problems could be stemming from the original film elements as I remember experiencing some weird audio issues on the standard DVD. I do trust that the replacement discs are fine (most reviewers here are happy with the replacement discs). If the new batch already took care of the audio issues, it would be nice if Mill Creek communicated that somehow -maybe with a note in the package- to eliminate the need to deal with replacement discs/requests.

Widescreen: Some reviewers complain about the presentation not being in widescreen. That is not a legitimate criticism as the show was never in widescreen format. And I don't think there is any need for it to be now. It is presented in its original aspect ratio.

Packaging is just alright. I am not entirely happy with the way the discs sit on top of each other but I do own other TV shows where the discs sit on top of each other. It is not ideal but if you handle them carefully, I think they won't cause any problems.

My biggest complain is that the Blu-ray does not have subtitles. I was thinking about taking off one star from my review because of that. Individual seasons of Miami Vice on Standard DVD do have subtitles. I am not sure why Mill Creek Entertainment left them out. Would it cost them a lot of money to include the subtitles?

As for the show itself, Miami Vice is probably the most stylized TV show ever made. The soundtrack is simply amazing and adds so much character to the show. I don't think there is any musical piece in the entire series that I do not love. Every song is spot on. In addition to the excellent soundtrack, the show is visually elegant, external scenes against the backdrop of Miami, wardrobes of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas (which created a trend) and overall style of shooting the show is just awesome. I could watch the show over and over again just to listen to the soundtrack or watch the visual style. As for some criticism on the show, some episodes are not very compelling in terms of story telling, does not match the sophistication of the visual style and  it has always bothered me the way the guys are shooting out in the open without cover and get shot easily and those shots do not look very realistic as you watch people getting shot close up but no blood.

Overall, I would highly recommend Miami Vice Blu-ray The Complete Series to any fan or a new comer who wants to explore the show. It may have its flaws but still a great purchase and worth it (if you consider individual seasons being priced around $25)",1492128000,8,3869,4.447108603667137

219644,2,6300183785,"Miami Vice the series on blu-ray at last. And that's pretty much the only positive thing about it. Video and audio quality could've and should've been better. Look for the release of Knight Rider to see how it should be done, same period, similar production values and better in every way. Video wise the first season is a disaster and the next don't do much better. Audio is even worse, the original stereo track is a mere dolby digital (when will they learn that original and/or old fashioned doesn't mean low quality :-( ?). I still choose that, partly because I prefer original tracks and also because the new 5.1 track is defective as acknowledged by Mill Creek Entertainment. They have started a replacement program but they don't ship outside continental U.S and Canada, while Amazon seems unable to locate and send as replacement box sets from the functional production run, even though as per Mill Creek Entertainment's instructions they can be identified by product numbers added specifically on the spine art of seasons 1 and 4 of the corrected production run. I've received 2 replacements that are still defective after having been guaranteed by Amazon to be functional and I've decided to opt for a full refund and call it a day. So international customers beware. As a fan I was tempted to give it 3 stars but that would've put my rating in the better half and that wouldn't have been reasonable. I can't believe they got it so wrong, what a mess :-( :-( :-( .",1485820800,7,1474,4.694980694980695

219710,5,6300183785,I haven't watched many tv shows I care enough about to want to own. I've always thought Don Johnson was a very good actor. When I set out to see if I could own some of his work I searched his name. I was shocked to see Miami Vice was available. I debated getting it cos I've bought older movies that was grainy. But Vice was a huge thing for me on Friday nights back in the 80s. I'd rush to make sure everything was done so I could watch it in peace. I loved the Daytona!!! Don so rocked those clothes!!! So I decided to get it on Blu-ray hoping the picture quality would be better than dvds I've bought from the period. When I got it I immediately started watching. I noticed some infrequent audio issues so I ordered another 1 & amazon promptly replaced it. When it happened in the same place I looked at reviews in here & discovered others had reported the same issue. So I found Mill Creek Entertainment's number (866) 410-9000 & reported to customer service I'm running into audio issues. I got a call back from Lyle. He was very pleasant & understanding. Which was nice because there isn't any customer service in most companies these days. But Lyle was really nice. He promptly sent me out the discs to replace the ones having the issue. So go on buy it!!! Beautiful beautiful picture on Blu-ray. That surprised me the most I think. If I didn't know I'm watching discs I'd swear it's 1984+ and I'm watching NBC. I always wondered why older people watch older shows. Listen to older music. Now that I'm older I understand why. It takes us back to when we were younger. It's been more than a delight to see this again. It's like running into an old friend and picking up where you left off. You just gotta look at it as... you are watching a TV show about Miami Vice cops from back in the 80s. Thanks Mill Creek for breathing life back into a TV show I never dreamed I'd see again!!!,1484697600,15,1888,4.276536312849162

Solid Blu Ray set that exceeded expectations. After reading some reviews here I was thinking that I'd be getting something simply ""bearable"" to watch but considering the fact this is TV from the 1980s it looks great.  It is a bare-bones set (so no extras) but the packaging looks sharp, discs are secured and again the picture Quality is solid. Audio is just ""ok"" but  that doesn't take away from the viewing enjoyment at all.  Immensely fun to be watching this old gem on a 70 inch flat screen!

219869,2,6300183785,"As expected this is a budget blu-ray set and the quality fluctuates from being extremely good to very poor. This is not only per episode, but also per episode itself. For example, the title role with the characteristic theme is extremely poor. Marks are clearly are clearly visible and I wonder if even an attempt is made to restore this to the original quality. Mistakes are wide-spread, for example Nobody Lives Forever (Season 1, disc 4) does not contain a DTS master 5.1 audio track. Only AC-3 2.0. Subtitles are absent on almost every Mills Creek release and this set is not an exception. This is really a problem if you have hearing problems.

On the bright side, the overall quality is definitely much better than the DVD-releases of the past. The sound definitely rocks if you consider that the first season was recorded mono. Combined with the reasonable price, the purchase of the set is still a good buy. But production companies really have to start include quality assurances into their distribution contracts as consumers get a relative poor product in comparison to the capabilities of blu-rays.",1480204800,2,1110,4.904255319148936

219954,4,6300183785,"I am mostly a movie guy but Miami Vice was a favorite show of mine as a kid and it holds up extremely well today. The stories, style, music and action are all on the high-end of 80's television. Michael Mann infused the show with such a great cinematic tone it rivals many 80's crime films in quality. If you like Michael Mann movies (Heat, Collateral, Thief) or you like 80's crime stores I think Vice is a no-brainer purchase, especially for the first few seasons. I am almost through the first two seasons in this set and have been smiling from ear to ear.

When we first heard the news Mill Creek we worried Miami Vice would be poorly handled on blu-ray. I am happy to report this is (mostly) not the case. The HD masters Universal have given Mill Creek to release are pretty solid. There are some flat or faded scenes, mostly early in the show's run. There are nighttime scenes that are very grainy but this is normal and good for film. There is a great increase in detail in most scenes, especially daytime scenes. It's not the complete and amazing remaster Star Trek: The Next Generation got, but it's a very solid effort that blows away the DVDs. Don't listen to anyone saying it should look cleaner, brighter or widescreen. It should look ACCURATE to how the show was shot, which it does.

Sound quality is very solid. There is a flaw in a few season one episodes with the 5.1 audio, but Mill Creek just today announced replacement discs. On every other disc the 5.1 track is solid, though I ended up using the original stereo tracks. Season one was done in mono and sounds a little flat, but from season two on the stereo tracks have a lot of punch and sound great. The music is all intact and is a highlight of the show, as it should be.

The packaging is cheap, there are no extras, it's not a completely amazing overhaul of the show. However it's also $50-60 on average. For that price this is an amazing set which blows away the DVDs and streaming versions and gives you a permanent Miami Vice set that will likely never be topped. An easy purchase recommendation.",1477872000,66,2078,4.420365535248042

220005,3,6300183785,"Despite negatives on the audio issues (which is really only noticeable in a couple of spots in the first few episodes) this is actually a pretty great little set. True, my expectations weren't exactly high given what I've seen about Mill Creek's other releases - but this is reasonably okay. A little extra effort could have made it truly great though.

POSITIVES:
* Great shows (obviously)
* HD transfers look great. Generally clean image. Still in original 4:3 format (thankfully not recropped for widescreen as this would have ruined it)
* Some effort has gone into the audio. The soundtrack is one key element that made this series. Shame it was botched in a couple of spots but not the end of the world.

NEGATIVES (mostly ones I can live with)
* Cheap & tacky cases. Disks stacked on top of each other. I think most fans would have been happy to spring a few extra bucks for decent cases - and maybe even a great presentation case with memorabilia booklet.
* No subtitles. Really useful for those of us in multi-lingual households or where we can't blast the soundtrack late at night.
* Issues with Dolby 5.1 remix in a few spots. Honestly, great thing that Mill Creek thought to try a remix ... but investing in better Quality Control will stop upset fans badmouthing your product.
* Minor issue - but some video clean-up might have helped in a few spots. I suspect this is an issue with the original film elements more than a fault in the transfer. For example, there are a few grainy shots - especially some indoors shots in the first episode where there's likely been insufficient lighting or optical zoom has been used to focus in on the actors' faces. Applying some digital noise reduction (albeit sparingly) to these shots might have made them a little less jarring. Colours in the first few episodes also seem a little muted - again I'm not sure how much of this is a transfer issue, but some quality control and bumping the colour saturation / white balance may have helped even things out to give a punchier look. This may have been warranted as today's screens are quite different than those we had when watching the show in the 80s.
* Multi-region disks. This would have been a bonus for those of us in Region B countries (Australia, NZ, Europe). Although fortunately there are ways around this.

SUMMARY:
It's an okay effort by Mill Creek. Still a good set for fans if you don't mind some issues. Sadly, Mill Creek have made some mistakes, and missed an opportunity to make this a truly great flagship product for them. Poor quality control has let them down, generating howls of anguish from angry fans and the expense of shipping replacement disks. Hopefully, whoever releases this in Region B countries will take heed of lessons learnt here and make a much more memorable release.",1477094400,14,2802,4.656565656565657
220006,2,6300183785,"I don't know what to do. I got my copy in. Right away, there were issues, as the episodes are not in widescreen so I have to use the wide button on my tv to smear the pic across the screen, another thing, 5.1 has a hollow echo effect, and in some episodes the lip synch was off, or the action onscreen did not match the sound.

You can also clearly see the artifacts, or snow in the picture.  I have the complete collection on DVD, and I thought when the series received the blu-ray treatment we would see, a complete remaster, meaning, 1080p, cleaned up visuals, true 5.1 or 7.1 sound, but what they did here I don't like, and to honest I would have gladly paid more for that.

I guess I was expecting a remaster, maybe that was unrealistic but I expected better. The quality control just isn't good, and I am surprised Universal would allow Mill Creek to release one of their greatest series with such quality issues.

Why put these old tv shows in full HD if you don't do anything to enhance the visual quality, or the aspect ratio, or in this case make the sound worse than DVD?  This needs to be pulled from all shelves, until corrected.",1477094400,6,1142,4.293023255813954

220009,1,6300183785,"I was a big "" Vice "" fan. I've watched every episode at least 3 times it's initial run until series finale,so I thought let's relive that retro 80's era  and kick out 60 bucks for the blu ray. I mean blu ray, Vice  has gotta look awesome remastered right? Wrong! What kind of remaster is this? The picture goes grainy in certain scenes throughout  episodes. The blu ray 4.3 ratio is fixed, and cannot be changed, A good thing I'm not hearing impaired because there are no subtitles! Television shows remastered from decades before Vice look 10 times better than this release. This mill creek version is the pits I'll never buy anything even remotely associated with that name ever again. I gave 2 stars for the sound which is decent on my home theater system. Why Universal  would give a groundbreaking property like this, to a company that's obviously incapable of giving it the justice it deserves, is beyond me.

In the opening scene staged in a warehouse of Season 1 episode ""Heart of Darkness"" the pronounced reverb makes the video unwatchable. I set the audio to Dolby Digital Stereo. This was likely how the show soundtrack was originally produced. I forgot how good this series was for the intense stories and the better if not best of the 80's music. At this time I'm debating to return the box set. I don't see an alternative for obtaining the set. One star for product not being as described 5.1 audio.",1476748800,12,602,4.635514018691588
220011,4,6300183785,"I retract my original review. Upon further watching I kind of jumped the gun. The colours are alright. Definitely an improvement over the dvds and the sound is a lot better. There was apparently some manufacturing defects with the audio echoing in certain episodes, and I heard some have audio that isn't synched properly. I experienced the echoing on Heart Of Darkness but no synching that I've experienced so far. Mill Creek is looking into the issue, so if this gets resolved then these blu rays will be decent quality. I hope this gets fixed because I am a huge Miami Vice fan.

*UPDATE*
Originally I gave this 3 stars due to the picture quality on Season 1. Although at times it looks rather average, when you get to season 2 the picture quality gets significantly better, seems less grainy, and the colours really pop. So I decided to give it 4 stars. The picture could be better but this is the best it's looked so far, so I am totally happy with this quality.",1476748800,4,967,4.525714285714286

220083,4,6300183785,"This is a total re-edit from my original review first the good... When the product first came out there were some MAJOR audio issues with a few of the episodes... Mill Creek Ent. did the customers right with replacement BluRay to all who could prove purchase. granted the packaging was a little cheap but they did the best they could with what they had been given by the rights holder and managed to turn out a major TV series at a very inexpensive price. Kudos to them. Also of course great series so that adds to the star rating...

Now the bad... not widescreen I can live with this understanding it was shot in 4:3 for television. I am also disappointed in the lack of special features. I mean, if you are going to go through all of the trouble of renewing all of the song licenses (which to my understanding is the reason it took so long to release this on Blu-Ray in the first place) and do a remaster process etc. I'd like to see something extra added in. A featurette or two on the music of the show or the style or heck even a ""Where are they now"" segment. I mean that's just adding basic customer value. They couldn't even add subtitles to the thing.
It just seems like they rushed this out there trying to get it in before Christmas  I'd have been more than happy to wait another 3 or 4 months and paid an extra $10 or $20 if they had gotten this right. These issues and the blame for them fall on NBC/Universal though, not on Mill Creek. It's a shame that NBC couldn't take more pride in a show the have that really helped define a generation. These things reduce my rating by one star. I still recommend buying.",1476489600,16,1624,4.26948051948052

This is a fantastic much needed improvement. It really brings out the 80s colors, 1980s Miami Vice was totally made for hi DEF, and this Blu-ray does not disappoint. The other neg comments some mention about the audio. And yes there are a couple of episodes that have a few minutes of a hollow sound.  It's not during the entire episode.  It's barely noticeable unless you're looking for it.  This is a must for fans of vice.  I'm  very pleased with the bluray upgrade.",1476489600,5,636,4.422413793103448

I saw the show in the old days but have never experienced like this. Get it if you are a Miami Vice fan. UPDATE:  Now that I finished Season One---yes, there are instances in a couple episodes where there is echo issue with the mix. It doesn't affect the Dolby Stereo track.

When the Mill Creek logo is even pixelated and looks bad, you can count on them not bothering to restore and clean up the picture. Looks like a direct transfer from video with the exception of the first five episodes in season one. However, the colors look terrible on those first five. Hue is off and has too much green and blue. Universal did an HD version of the first five, so I imagine the transfer is from that; however, the HD on Hulu streaming is far better and the color balance is better. The original DVD release from universal was actually better, and even that wasn't all that good. REALLY disappointed. Mill Creek must have a McDonalds-level team to put out something this bad. The packaging? Discs are stacked on top of each other (2 per side). Audio problems galore! Weird echo effect on several episodes. This is my favorite series and I never thought I'd say this after waiting so long, but I'm returning these blu-rays and keeping my original universal dvds.

220090,1,6300183785,PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW. First the series then the discs. Miami Vice defined the 80s and influenced the cop buddy formula as far as I'm concerned. Its an excellent show with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas perfectly cast as the main characters surrounded by a great cast in general that includes an outstanding Edward James Olmos and endless cameos. The series gets a 5. Now to the discs. This is a tough one to rate. The picture quality is great (a lot better than I expected) but unfortunately I and other people have noticed some extremely bad audio issues on some episodes especially episode 2 of season 1 but its only on the 5.1 mix. There's a horrible echo when there is talking and an echoey sound in general in the background. The 2.0 mix is just fine except it isn't lossy audio. Im not sure if other episodes are affected but I won't know because now I'm just sticking with the 2.0 unless Mill Creek corrects the issue and offers a replacement program for the affected discs. Another complaint I have is that discs are stacked on top of eachother but as long as you take care of them and be careful which you should do with a product you value anyways it should be fine. That is minor compared to the audio issue though. Unfortunately I can't recommend people pay their hard earned money on a defective product so I have to give this a low 1 star rating due to the audio issue. I've only started it though so I will update this review if I notice any further defects or problems. Be warned the audio issue is unwatchable. I emailed Mill Creek about the issue and hopefully they will do something to correct this and I highly encourage everyone else to reach out to Mill Creek as well for their blu ray series.

I'm pretty sure it contains all the episodes of season 5 since it says ""even the lost episodes"".  I rated them OK because I really haven't seen much of them.  However, I don't understand why after delaying the release because of quality problems Mill Creek still put out discs that had some scenes that are grainy.  If you are not an aficionado they may be acceptable.  Since I have been watching the series on DVD and am up to episode 1 of season 5,  I will watch season 5 on Blu Ray.  What I see will determine whether I keep them or return them.  Like I said some scenes are stunning. Finally watched more episodes.  Grainy scenes are awful.  There is one scene in Victims of Circumstance where the background is actually white.  Very strange.  The set was cheap at $56, but even that was too much.  I have returned it.

October 25, 2016.  Now I'm reviewing the DVDs. Since I returned the blu-ray I thought maybe I would order the DVDs just to have since I do have DVDs from Mill Creek of season 1 and the package is fine and the DVDs play as good or better than the Blu-Ray did.  Boy was I wrong.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Since I only had to pay about $30 for these DVDs,I guess I had it coming.  The box (?) they come in is more like paper.  Inside the box there are sleeves (paper) holding 2 DVDs each making up 20 discs for 5 seasons.  I'm not going to return them. I may not even watch them for a while.  I am tired of returning inferior products.  I thought VEI did a poor job on the Nash Bridges DVD set. The discs were bad, but the packaging looked like a million dollars compared to this.

I know there was a lot ADR dubbing in places which are also evident on the DVD but comparing it to the DVD release it's noticeably worse.  Also the second episode ""Heart of Darkness"" the audio is 180 degrees out of phase and sounds hollow and has a strange echo/reverb effect on certain scenes.  The 5.1 Dolby mix on the DVD sounds better.  Also the episode ""Home Invaders"" would not play DTS-MA audio and can only play Dolby 2.0 stereo only.  ""Evan"" has out of phase audio with echo/reverb distortion on the DTS-MA audio but sounds fine on the Dolby 2.0 stereo mix.  I have sent an e-mail to Mill Creek Entertainment bringing these issues to their attention in hopes that they will fix the issues and offer corrected replacement discs.

10/13/16 - Mill Creek has responded to my inquiry and have forwarded my concerns to their production and manufacturing team to investigate the audio issues and will contact me when they have determined the best course of action should they offer replacement discs so there is hope they will fix this!

UPDATE: 10/31/16 - Mill Creek has responded to address the audio problems.  They will be sending out corrected replacement discs! Here is the e-mail they just sent out:

""To our customers and fans of Miami Vice, we thank you for your patronage and passionate responses to the Miami Vice - Complete Series release on Blu-ray. We appreciate the messages we have received and have been following on forums and social media. We have investigated and reviewed the issues found, debated, and discussed. We hope we can provide answers and clarity because we want fans to be able to enjoy this landmark TV series to its fullest.

  Aspect Ratio
o  It has always been our intention to release the series in its original, full screen aspect ratio which is how the HD masters were provided to us.

  Packaging
o  Based on customer feedback, we chose to package this product using standard Blu-ray cases inside a slipcase instead of packaging using cardboard sleeves. Unfortunately, we cannot control how our resellers re-package and ship direct-to-consumer, so for any consumers receiving damaged product from shipping, please notify the retailer directly.

  Audio Sync
o  The audio throughout the series is in sync as on the masters provided. For those moments questioned, they are a result of dubbing (ADR) from the production of the show. We have been unable to identify any occurrence of asynchronous audio as a result of our authoring of the episodes. We have concluded that the issues are more noticeable now than in previous DVD releases due to the uncompressed DTS-HD Master Audio and HD video which cause these slight imperfections to become much more audible than ever before. This also affects the dynamic range in the audio during scenes where background audio may also become more noticeable. This will vary by individual home audio systems, setups, and personalized audio settings.

  5.1 Audio
o  We have re-QCed each and every episode across all five seasons and have identified the following 4 episodes in Season 1 which have errors with the new 5.1 lossless audio:

Heart of Darkness
  The 5.1 audio track does have issues in the mix creating an echo/reverb-like effect that phases in and out periodically throughout the episode.

The Home Invaders
""Nobody Lives Forever""
  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio tracks were accidentally left-off the disc after we conducted the original QC

Evan
  The 5.1 audio track does have issues in the mix creating an echo/reverb-like effect that phases in and out periodically throughout the episode.

We apologize for these errors and are fully prepared to fix the issues in Season 1 on Discs 1 and 4 of the Blu-ray Complete Series set.  We will send disc replacements out to customers who contact us and provide us with proof of purchase.  It will take several weeks for replacement discs to become available, so we appreciate your patience as we work to resolve these errors.""

Bravo, Mill Creek, for taking responsibility and fixing the audio problems.",1476144000,206,4300,4.929068150208623

220253,2,6300183785,"MIAMI VICE TV SERIES finally on blu-ray which is Great so it should be
but it's Independent company Mill creek that's reissued all 5 seasons on blu-ray, not universal which is tragic
there's alot of problems with the transfers & the audio, plus no extras anyway so Definitely not worth the cash
1st not all the 1080p HD transfers are 100% solid on every episode which is tragic
some episodes have very Good HD transfers and some look similar to Digital remaster quality only
meaning still some Grain & Dirt in the quality
plus all episodes have there original 1:33:1 ratio with black pillars which i found annoying
at least Universal made the effort to somehow make 1:33:1 ratio to appear 1:85:1 ratio without the black pillars
and Universal did this without stretching the picture image aswell
2nd the so called 5.1 master mix drops in & out thru out each episode on all seasons so the 5.1 mix is not solid
Incredibly insulting obviously Mill creek didn't make much effort to make this reissue worrthwhile
3rd no extras at all absolutely O extras, so the extras from Universal season 1 dvd have not been carried over
and 4, terrible packaging
each season has 4 Blu-ray Discs packed on top of each other inside clamshell case which i think is plain Laziness by Mill creek
the Discs should've been put on Disc trays really
Uneven HD transfers, Uneven 5.1 sound quality are you kidding me what a Joke, Universal should've reissued the series on blu-ray
not a small company like Mill creek
so i personally think the Universal dvd versions still Hold up compared to this Insulting blu-ray reissue
amazon are selling this for $50 a big ripoff waste of money this new blu-ray reissue is not worth $1
MIAMI VICE Deserves alot more respect than this Insulting blu-ray reissue
5 stars for the TV series, 1-2 stars for this new blu-ray reissue, very tragic",1467763200,6,1846,4.683076923076923

220256,5,6300183785,"The TV series ""Miami Vice"" stars Don Johnson as Vice Detective James 'Sonny' Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs, an ex-New York street cop who after the first episode becomes Sonny's partner. A police drama which aired for five seasons, the hit TV series was first aired in September, 1985 until the series ended in July, 1989. Other regular cast members included: Lt. Martin Castillo (Edward James Olmos), Det. Gina Navarro Calabrese (Saundra Santiago), Det. Trudy Joplin (Olivia Brown), Det. Stanley 'Stan' Switek (Micahel Tolbott), and Det. Lawrence 'Larry' Zito (John Diehl, but only for the first three seasons).

Episode #1 & #2 ""Brother's Keeper"": In the pilot two-parter episode (original working title ""Dade County Fast Lane""), Sonny reluctantly teams up with New Yorker Rico to solve several murders connected to a mysterious Colombian drug lord named Calderone (Miguel Pinero). But Sonny feels that Rico is not really being honest and that the New Yorker has his own agenda. Will they be able to work together to bring the drug lord to justice?

Being the pilot of the series, the episode really sets the stage for the entire series, most importantly the first meeting between future partners Sonny and Rico. A good start to a fantastic series, ""Brother's Keeper"" has it all. Here is a list of what to expect in the series and how this episode showcases each merit:

Acting: What can I say, ""Miami Vice"" boasts star power, most prominently Johnson and Thomas as the main characters. Both are talented, conveying both their professional and relaxed sides with ease. Johnson's best scenes are easily when he's with his son, Billy, in part 1 and when he confronts a 'mole' in the police department. Rico's best scene is when he catches up with Calderone. Saundra Santiago as Gina also has a great moment when she finds the rose Sonny left for her.

Action: Expect plenty of action in ""Miami Vice"", action and excitement. Besides the dramatic elements of this police drama, there is plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat. Best action and most tense sequence of this episode is easily the last showdown against Calderone. Well done!

Boats/Cars/Chases: ""Miami Vice"" has plenty of nice 'hardware', that's for certain! The show became a 'cult program' for car lovers, especially because of Sonny Crockett's car. His original car was the Daytona Spyder, or rather, a look-alike Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona Spyder (in other words, it was really a Corvette). Later on the series, Ferrari was so upset about the series using a 'fake' Ferrari (because the 'fake' Ferrari was getting so much attention) that they gave the show a new car for Crockett to drive around in; a Ferrari Testarossa. Crockett also owns two boats, the ""St. Vitus' Dance"" where he lives and a Chris Craft Stinger. Best chase is when Rico 'borrows' Crockett's boat.

Cinematography: Fantastic cinematography, some of the best I've ever seen in any TV series. Nice camera work especially on moving cars like in the car chases. Action sequences are filmed well, as are the 'MTV' moments.

Drama: Besides excitement, expect some 'shockers' or moments where you feel the tears forming in your eyes. Plenty of touching moments in this episode, though cannot reveal what they are or it'll spoil the episode.

Humor: Mostly a drama, ""Miami Vice"" still has plenty of humorous moments. Classic funny scenes in this episode which are my favorites are: 1) when Sonny introduces Rico to 'Elvis', 2) when there's a temporary blackout at the courtroom, and 3) when Sonny vents out his anger because a bust he's been working on for two weeks goes down the drain.

Music: ""Miami Vice"" most certainly truly began the idea of integrating short 'music video clips' into a TV series. Scattered throughout the show are hit songs and songs which eventually became hits through the show. Jan Hammer composed the soundtrack for the film, including the famous theme song for ""Miami Vice"". The pilot includes these songs:

*Miss You ~ Rolling Stones* - played from the boombox at the beginning

*Body Talk ~ The Deele* - played in the New York club

*Somebody's Watching Me ~ Rockwell* - played at a Miami strip club

*Girls Just Wanna Have Fun ~ Cyndi Lauper* - played on the Miami beach

*All Night Long ~ Lionel Richie* - performed by a band in a restaurant

*In the Air Tonight ~ Phil Collins* - played as Crockett & Tubbs drive to a bust (perhaps one of the most famous song in the entire show)

Star Power: All right, I admit, the main reason I'm watching the series is because of Don Johnson. But honestly ladies, after seeing him in ""Miami Vice"", how can you resist? At the time, Don Johnson easily through this series became a sex symbol with his expensive sports jackets (usually white with matching white trousers) worn over a simple t-shirt, no socks (it's true!), and unshaven appearance. A must watch show for Don Johnson fans because besides his great looks, he is also a great actor.

To sum up, ""Miami Vice"" has it all. Has been nominated for and won several Emmys and Golden Globe awards, most noticeably winning a 'Best Actor in a Drama TV Series Award' for Don Johnson. Great acting from great actors, fantastic music, lots of drama with a nice dash of humor, nice cinematography, gripping action, and to top it off, hot cars. Don't pass this show up, especially the TV series pilot, still one of my favorites. My only complaint (as many others have voiced... when's the DVD coming out?

*Message to Parents* ~ Since this is a TV series and does not necessarily have a rating, I will take the liberty of putting my own rating on. I would say ""Miami Vice"" safely deserves a PG-13. In other words: definitely not for kids or young teenagers and needs parental guidance. This is mostly because of the overall theme of ""Miami Vice"". Dealing with drugs, prostitution, gambling, money laundering, and several other mature themes, kids should be well kept away since first of all, they won't have a clue what is going on. They won't enjoy what they don't understand. And while it being a TV show means there is much they cannot show, there is indeed much they can very easily 'insinuate"". Sonny and Rico are both notorious womanizers... you guess the rest. Also, there is a small amount of swearing. Parents and older teen should enjoy the series.",1098835200,4,6342,4.802752293577981
220257,5,6300183785,"This has to be one of the best programs of the 80's in fact ever.
Never has a show created such an impression on me like this show
did and i probabley won't ever find it again. Because Miami Vice
was a show that was great for it's time and is still way ahead
of our time went it comes to great storylines, music fashion,
cars anything you can think of this show showcased it long before
it became popular. The teaming of Sonny Crockett a wise mouth
seasoned vice cop who lives with his pet aligator Elvis and the
Cool Well dressed Ladykiller Cop from New York Ricardo Tubbs was
well done in contrast and style and as the series went on you never get tired of the show and it's chracters because it always kept you going in non stop excitement with great scripts, great villians and actual beautiful Miami Florida Scenery. I wished they would release the series on video and see just how many die hard fans would pick it up that it would be instantly declared cult status. I love this show!!!! At one time i wanted to be like
Don Johnson because i thought he was what i emvisioned coolness
was a nice sportscar, beautiful women and a fanatastic wardrobe.

220258,5,6300183785,"""Miami Vice"" was sold by creator Michael Mann to NBC as ""MTV Cops,"" and this police drama more than lived up to that label juxtaposing the glamorous resort city of Miami with the seamy haunts of the drug underworld.  In this pilot movie, which first aired on September 16, 1964, our two heroes meet for the first time.  Detective James ""Sonny"" Crockett (Don Johnson) was a vice detective who lived on his sailboat St. Vitus' Dance with his pet alligator Elvis.  Richard Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) was an ex-New York street cop who came to Miami to hunt down the drug dealer who murdered his brother.  This first case not only brought Crockett and Tubbs together, it made them partners.
The MTV influences were obvious from this first episode: as Sonny drives around the streets of Miami at night, pondering why his marriage to his estranged wife, Caroline (Belinda Montgomery) is dead, the show makes effective use of Phil Collin's ""In the Air Tonight"" in what is essentially a music video.  Jan Hammer's driving theme song and evocative soundtrack became as much a part of the show as the actors and the location.  The show made Don Johnson a sex symbol with his expensive pastel sports jackets worn over a t-shirt, no socks and a stubbly beard--what became known as the macho/grubby look.  However, when we look back at the show today what really stands out is its introduction fo Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo, the head of the Vice unit (when was the last time you same Thomas in anything?).  Olmos is not in the pilot, but Jimmy Smits is as Crockett's original partner, who ends up getting killed, setting the stage for Tubbs being the new partner.  As for Mann, he was able to bring his unique sense of style to several successful theatrical films, most notably ""The Last of the Mohicans.""
Looking back, ""Miami Vice"" is one of the more significant shows of the 1980's simply for the way in which it made contemporary rock music an integral part of television drama.  Every time you catch a hit song on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Dawson's Creek,"" it is all because of what happened on ""Miami Vice.""  Note that Sonny tools around Miami in a black Ferrari Spider sports car, which was later traded in for an even snazzier Ferrari Testarossa after the original car was blown up (accidentally) at the beginning of the third season.",1010880000,16,2350,4.693430656934306
