8059100,4,B0009CTTVA,"I saw this DVD last night, all three episodes. The first episode was about Rachel's friend, Serena Sebastian, who's sister was going to marry a man who was one of three triplets. The father of Serena's sister fiance was visiting the Sebastian manor. When all is well, the power goes out just after the father of the son who's going to marry leaves. Someone is then seen with a mask smashing something with a bloddy rock. When Conan and the others go outside ther see the mashed body of Serena's sisters fiance's father. When the other two triplets come to the scene, it's up to Conan to find out which one has killed their father. It's a good mystery DVD with two other good episodes, but at times it might be a little confusing, but it was a good product!",1122940800,9,756,4.4071428571428575
