8187483,5,B00006FD90,"After watching the first volume straight through, i can not wait to see the next volume!  Lisa Ortiz (Lina Inverse of the ""Slayer's"" series) is a perfect cast for the principal character ""Mito"" for the english dub version!
The animation is sharp and colorful, and just cheeky enough for the style of the story.  I also enjoyed the jaunty play on some of my other favorite anime, as well as one of my favorite rock songs! Although the stories in each series do get a little silly every now and then, it isn't over done, and the scenes are very well timed.
The Story involves an alien space pirate called ""Mito"" who visits her earth born son, who is unaware of his mother's true career path, believing instead that she is a New York supermodel.  In the process, the galactic police follow her in attempt to arrest her, her son, and the rest of Mito's crew, and find a key to a super weapon that Mito has hidden somewhere in the galaxy.  Adventures abound for the overprotective mom and her son as Mito tries to get her son to call her mom again, all the while trying to avoid giant transforming robots (made out of everything from a construction site boom crane, to a pinic table umbrella), a maniacal high school teacher who is in dire need of a reality check, and jealous girlfriends!
All in all, a great series so far!",1044230400,,1319,4.43801652892562
