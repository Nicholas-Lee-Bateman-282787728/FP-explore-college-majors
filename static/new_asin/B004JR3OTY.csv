4391115,4,B004JR3OTY,"I saw this at a store and the cover is probably the best i've seen in a long time. However, you cannot judge a horror movie but it's cover. 9 out of 10 times the movie will suck. Mask Maker is about a couple who buy a home in the middle of nowhere. A long time ago the woman who lived there was accused of being a witch and was killed by the towns people and so was her baby. Her husband whoses face was horribly burned saw the entire event, I might have missed something. Anyways, the man unearths a stick in the graveyard behind there house and the man is resurrected. If you're a person who needs to see someone killed every ten minutes, then this movie is not for you. It's slow placed but the kills are well done. The killer looks like the new Leatherface without muscles. The ending was a typical slasher ending and I guess there will be another part made. I'd welcome a sequel since this did have potential.

Overall, a good horror movie that was a little slow paced.",1316908800,,974,4.208556149732621
4391116,3,B004JR3OTY,"A guy buys a house for his girl and there friends come to celebrate. Then they die by some masked guy who reminds you of leather face from Texas C. The deaths were alright and the storyline was good enough. His masks were basically the faces of whoever he killed which is easy to get in general. Plus they do show the backdrop to who this killer is and why everything is happening, so it was fun to watch this C horror film but don't rush out to buy it.",1313625600,3,453,4.044444444444444
4391117,2,B004JR3OTY,"I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen.",1307232000,6,628,4.1138211382113825
4391118,5,B004JR3OTY,"I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!",1302652800,7,592,4.201754385964913
4391119,4,B004JR3OTY,"This movie was fun to watch although it drags on a bit at times. I have to say that I was more impressed with the acting in this low budget horror flick than the majority of the cookie-cutter characters I'm used to seeing in horror movies. If you are looking for a movie full of blood and guts, this may not be your cup of tea. But, if you want to watch a fun movie with good acting and some decent scares, this is your kind of movie. Definitely worth the watch.",1302480000,3,462,4.032608695652174
4391120,3,B004JR3OTY,"What if your dream turned out to be a nightmare?  After Jennifer's (Deloach) boyfriend Evan (Colletti) surprises her with a new house for her birthday strange things begin to happen.  This is a hard movie to review.  It is not that bad, but it drags, a lot.  It's another haunted house because of something buried in the land movie that is not that bad, but it would have been a good ""Fangoria Series"" movie at an hour long, trying to stretch it out for an hour and a half really hurt the movie.  If you are looking for a decent horror movie that is a cross between suspense and a slasher, this is a good choice.  If you are looking for a very scary movie then I would go for something else.  Not terrible, not great.  I did like the ending though.  I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - I doubt it.",1302393600,3,800,4.103225806451613
4391121,2,B004JR3OTY,"Mask Maker (Griff Furst, 2010)

Poor Stephen Colletti. The guy should fire his agent. First, he shows up in a Griff Furst movie. Then, the next year, he lands a part in Kill Katie Malone (q.v.). That he still has a career at all is down to his role in the TV series One Tree Hill. And to be fair, Mask Maker, while silly and derivative, is not as bad a movie as Kill Katie Malone; Griff Furst tends to be a director who gets attached to scripts without a single original idea in their collective head, but he does competent work with what he gets (and he's improved tremendously since the last feature of his I saw, the ridiculous Asylum mockbuster&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Omega/dp/B003ABZGDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Omega</a>).

Plot: mirroring at least a dozen other stupid slasher movies you've seen over the course of your life (or maybe a dozen you've seen in the last month), Mask Maker gives us the tale of a couple of college students, Evan (Colletti) and Jennifer (Love and Other Drugs' Nikki Deloach). Both are adrift, but have found each other; their relationship is long-standing, we are to gather from the opening scenes, but has never been stable. Evan, in an attempt to stabilize things, buys them a house--a mansion, really, an old plantation house he got an incredible deal on (in the way of college students, he never stopped to think about the ridiculous property taxes he will be responsible for come next April). A bunch of their friends appear in order to party, and unfortunately they all discover that the house was so cheap because it houses an undead, and seemingly unkillable, serial killer with horrible facial deformities who gets his moniker from his penchant for skinning the skulls of his victims and using their faces as masks.

On the other hand, the fact that it is a dead-generic supernatural slasher film that is relatively predictable means that if you're in the mood for this kind of thing and you've exhausted your personal library, you could do worse (a lot worse, actually) than Mask Maker. Don't go in expecting anything but a generic slasher film and you'll have a good enough time with it. The problem is, most people will go in at least expecting some sort of original content. So let this review serve as a kind of gateway: this is a turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy-the-ride movie. I'm impressed with Furst's progress as a director, and if he keeps going at this rate we may get something really good out of him in a few years. **",1365811200,,2539,4.886310904872389

4391123,4,B004JR3OTY,"I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert.",1349568000,,213,4.487179487179487
4391124,4,B004JR3OTY,This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!,1340150400,,315,4.015873015873016
4391125,2,B004JR3OTY,"This film seemed to have a bit of potential at first. It was obvious it was going to be a rehash of a lot of the old Leatherface clichs, but Nikki DeLoach's good humor was infectious and the couple launching off on their new life in the isolated old house was likeable. So I was ready to overlook the townsfolk with secret knowledge of the house's dangerous past - the gathering of frolicsome young people at the house, ready to be picked off by the killer while they were in the act - and all the other formulaic plot elements that the ""Scream"" series does such a good job satirizing.

But then things got really dreary. Leatherface, Michael Myers, and all the other killers in that tradition might have seemed almost superhuman in their ability to rebound. But the key word with them was ""almost."" They might be inexorable, but it was still possible, however remotely, that they could be representing real people. A viewer could justify the time spent watching these films with the ""based on a true story"" rationale. After all, Ed Gein was a real person who really did drape himself in human skin.

But the killer in this film seems to rise from the dead. He emerges from a mishmash of supernatural shenanigans. So there's no way I could feel I might learn anything about the heart of true evil by watching this film. And so it lost me.

""Mask Maker"" is well-photographed and has a few scary moments. But over all, it's a false-face.",1321833600,2,1435,4.532818532818533
4391126,1,B004JR3OTY,"Positives:
None that I can think of. Really, I'm trying.

Negatives:
(1.) Cheap, e.g. starting with no subtitles or special features. Acting experience/filmography for the most part consists of shorts, TV videos which is typical of cheap and quick almost made for TV productions. Cheap costume store style face masks and usual cheap knife/hatchet effects stabbings.
(2.) Not creative (you've seen this storyline so many times), time worn college students in a remote farm. The usual Native burial (never explained why) and the usual some sort of illicit child grows up to cause some bodily harm to some really dumb acting students. The usual towns folk have a secret about the previous occupant of the farm house which was, thinking she was a witch, they killed her with a Native spear (never explained why). One person survives, as usual, and we think the bad grown up child person is dead - but not really. Time for a cheap money making sequel.
(3.) The face mask has been done before and is anatomically/physically impossible for a variety of reasons so it loses some credibility points there. Besides they were't even scary. Unlike the superior SAW they didn't even bother to show much other than one time pulling a rubber mask off of a person to make it look like it was real.",1321660800,,1281,4.796380090497737
4391127,3,B004JR3OTY,"Mask Maker starts off with a flash back of something traumatic that happened years before in a barn next to the main house but we don't really learn about the real story until Jennifer and Evan move in to the house years later when Jennifer finds and reads a journal and as she reads it we go to more flash backs..Jennifer and Evan get the house,barn and 40 acres for 10.000 dollars and feel so fortunate that they got such an amazing deal and better yet the house is filled with pricey antiques ,they are about to find out nothing good comes cheap.
There were so many similarities between this and Friday The 13th part 2 and the house looks just like the one from the remake of the Texas Chainsaw massacre.
There is even a scene very reminiscent of the scene where Jason falls face first onto a machete in F-13th part 4.
I liked it because the story was pretty cool and the killer lurks around very Jason Voorhees/Michael Myers style and is very creepy. His face at first is bandaged because of some kind of skin Condition he had as a child.
The new owners invite two other couples for the weekend and one by one they go missing ""of course"" gotta love the slasher formula.
As each is killed the killer takes the skin from their faces and puts it over his, very Leather Face -esque..The kills and effects were good and not over done,it's the kind of semi gore you would see in a Friday the 13th film nothing over the top,that's why it had an old school feel to me. I give it 3 and 1/2 stars and would watch it again.",1320278400,6,1516,4.267361111111111
4391128,2,B004JR3OTY,"MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion.  A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty.  Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.
MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either.  The cast performs on various levels of competence.  WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon.  Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role.  Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role.  Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female.  Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.
An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.",1320105600,,954,5.109677419354838
4391129,2,B004JR3OTY,"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie.  The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers.  I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films.  The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history.  A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late.  Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights.  This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried.  Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.
Even the title is a misnomer!  Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.
And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres.",1320019200,,932,4.606060606060606
4391130,5,B004JR3OTY,"Mask Maker is Part-Chainsaw Massacare(Minus The Chainsaw and Better in My Opinion),Part Zombie(sorta),Part Jeepers Creepers but with a Slasher,Part SuperNatural,and a Little Voodoo/Black Magic(ugh) thrown in,But What I like is the story,it is not extremely gory, but it does have some gore which I'd prefer not but then it wouldn't be a great horror movie. I like that it is a House(40 acres and no Mule,Take That Jesse and Sharpton!)albeit a haunted one and the story is unique so that it does not ripoff any particular movie. I don't care for the hickexplotation making fun of country folk and such,It could have made fun of snotty Easterners or Leftcoasters just as well as they always seem more deranged than any backcountryhillbilly ever could.",1318204800,,749,5.097560975609756

8431978,3,B004JR3OTY,"To be honest there will be spoilers here in this review. This movie i obtained because it seemed interesting,however i found the acting to be predictable and kinda weak. The story kinda reminds me of Texas Chainsaw meets Toolbox Murders. The story is some murders took place on the property. Several years down the road 2 kids buy a home & try to fix it up with some friends. They pull a staff up from the earth,causing a curse to be released. The monserously deformed creature comes up to rip the faces off of everyone there. 1 gruesome death after another but it seemed kinda dragged out or not acted well enough. I have tons of horror films from Demons to Bloodsucking Freaks to City of the Living Dead,Basket Case,etc. But something about this film just did jot grab me. But for the price 4$ it isn't that bad.",1445472000,,814,4.469798657718121
