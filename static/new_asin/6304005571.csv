756413,5,6304005571,"THIS IS A SUPER FUNNY MOVIE, I LOVED IT!! I'M GLAD IT'S FINALLY ON DVD. DON KNOTTS IS THE GREATEST AND THIS MOVIE IS 60'S SWINGING FUN! I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING!",1060560000,4,161,4.225806451612903
756414,3,6304005571,"I saw this film on television decades ago, when I was extremely young. It was ludicrous then, but more so now. The premise of Knotts being, by misadventure, transformed into the figurehead of a Playboy-type empire is actually amusing, sometimes pathetic. Where this film (made in 1969) perhaps unknowingly hits home is when censors are shown to be interested in the material they want suppressed. They are, perhaps, seeking to censor something inside them. The film also scores when the sharp-witted editor (Ann Francis) of Knott's magazine, ""Peacock,"" sees him and it as innovators of a trend where sex portrayed openly does not have to be sleazy. That the minister father of the small town girl Knotts wants to marry insists, toward the film's end, on Knotts's publicly declaring himself ""pure"" is actually more degrading than his duped role as a sex symbol. This film, in its way, symbolizes a changing era.",1036368000,2,910,4.993421052631579
756415,1,6304005571,"This is quite an odd movie, and what makes it weirder is its premise.  A pornographer lost his mailing license, so he buys up Don Knotts' failing magazine, and being publishing his rag under the name of Don Knotts's paper.  Knotts, who has been in Brazil bird watching, comes back and gets mistaken for a wild playboy, and gets alienated from his small town heart-of-gold girlfriend.
So this is like a cross between ""The People vs. Larry Flint"" and ""A Face In The Crowd,"" but with the twitchy Don Knotts trying to pass himself off as a n Austin Powers type of swinger.
This is quite an odd film, and it dragged and sagged in many areas.  It has a lot of interesting secondary characters, and a very contrived ending.  This film is listed as PG-13, even though it was released in 1969, so I am not sure of the original rating, since PG-13 was invented in 1984 after people got mad at ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""",1022976000,3,922,4.405882352941177
756416,5,6304005571,"This was a missfire at the box office.
It was also the first Don Knotts film to miss getting a ""G"" rating.
It's also his best film, in my own humble opinion.
There is absolutley nothing offensive about this  gentle little comedy that has Don Knotts duped into becoming the publisher  of a racy mens magazine.
The laughs come fast, the script is wonderful,  there is a wonderful song in the middle of the film called ""Mister  Peacock"" (Don's character's name is Abner Peacock"") that has Don  strutting to the music, in a montage of openings of the ""peacock""  club's around the world, and the pacing is just right!
Of course, in the  end, Don realize's he can't buy into this lifestyle and he winds up  marrying his virginal high school  sweetheart- what a wonderful movie!  I  am so glad it's finally on video!",955584000,31,809,4.548611111111111

756589,5,6304005571,"This is the funniest of the Don Knotts movies where he's essentially his Barney Fife character put into different situations.  ""The Love God?"" is the only social satire that Knotts ever did and it's pretty effective.  He plays wimpy, afraid-of-women, virginal Abner Peacock who is the publisher of the failing ornithology magazine, ""The Peacock.""  Some small-time pornographers need a mailing permit and give him the money to keep ""The Peacock"" going, but unbeknownst to him as a skin magazine.  The magazine becomes a sensation and Abner is now the rival of Hugh Hefner and the most famous and controversial man in America.  You'll have to watch the movie to find out how it all turns out.  Watch particularly for the great courtroom scene where the Attorney General and Abner's lawyer engage in dueling bombastic speeches about free speech.",1418083200,,842,5.065217391304348

It's halarious. Knotts plays a Hefner type at the height of
the sexual revolution and it works cause he's not the type
as was Hugh Hefner but in real life he was quite the ladies man!
This also has him as a small town country boy who is a virgin and
gets caught in with a swindler and the mob to put out a Xrated
magazine like Playboy but without his knowledge until it hits the
stands! Of course you can guess things don't go right and it all
blows up at the end. Knotts is halarious trying to play the playboy!

There were several very funny bits in this film (the 2 bird calling solos in particular, and Don lost in the jungles of Brazil.....no, that was pretty much it).  They lost me after things turned ugly with the evil/greedy uncle then the trial sequence, which was particularly nasty for a comedy.  Things careened wildly out of control after that, and not in a good way.  I realized that Anne Francis wasn't very adept at comedy (or else her character just wasn't funny).  They didn't use Edmond O'Brien enough or stick with the premise instead of going off on a tangent with the gangster and the word of the day.  They needed to focus on the matter at hand and not get bogged down with things that weren't germane to the plot.  But then, they never really fully utilized Don Knotts' talent in the movies.
This one made me cringe more than laugh.  And when they strayed into the 45 year old virgin territory.....yipes!  Not a movie I want to remember him for.  Not a keeper.",1315267200,3,1146,4.440191387559809
756729,2,6304005571,"This film is an odd mixture of a typical Don Knotts movie and a satire of the Hugh Hefner Playboy magazine/lifestyle. It does have some laugh out loud moments. Don stays ""pure"" thru-out. But there are many lascivious going-ons around him that somehow degrade his normally very innocent approach. Apparently at the time this film was turned down by many theatres, whose owners knew their core audiences would reject this offering.",1295568000,3,429,5.056338028169014

756732,2,6304005571,"When I decided to review this movie I could not believe the number of five and four star ratings it got.  This movie is just the next to last in the string of lousy movies Don Knotts made in the late 60's and early 70's.  The plot is predictable, the premise illogical, and the jokes are not that funny.

Knotts played the same character in all of his movies- the doofus from small town america that was swept into something- a haunted house, the space program, and the Hugh Hefner lifestyle- all backed up by his loyal home town love interest.  Obviously Universal intended to capitalize on Knotts' ""Barney Fife"" personna and believed these forays would be entertaining to the people who loved him in the Andy Griffith Show.

Unfortunately, it didn't work.  Almost all his movies were failures or made only small profits.  This movie was a pathetic attempt to garner an audience that wasn't primarily composed of children- hence its ""M"" rating at the time.

He made one more movie under his Universal contract and then it was allowed to lapse.

The only bright spot in this movie is Anne Francis, who I believe deserved better roles than she received over the years.

This DVD may be worth four dollars, but certainly not thirteen!",1247616000,3,1232,4.662037037037037
756733,5,6304005571,"I first saw this as a 13 year old on UHF television back in the early '70's, and though I didn't understand some of '60's sexual revolutionary themes this movie is based on (in a hilarious way) I've never forgotten many of the visuals of this fast-paced comedy and I still hum that catchy ""Mr. Peacock"" tune even now, over thirty years later. The transfer of the audio and celluloid print is excellent; the film could have been released last year. You'll recognize many of the character actors in this ""Hugh Hefner fighting for his First Amendment rights"" parody of an unwitting bird magazine publisher (Knotts) who gets conned into giving up his 4th class postal rights to a gentleman's skin magazine (tame by today's standards). Lots of laughs, girls (hence the PG-13 rating) and plot to amuse any fan of Don Knotts.",1233360000,2,818,4.7272727272727275
756734,1,6304005571,"I believe this movie must have been made at a time when sex was a new open topic, because it seems that the ONLY purpose this movie had whatsoever was to test how many times they could say the word ""sex"" in a movie during the sixties. It is not funny, sweet, sexy, dramatic or romantic. It is a nothing movie, nothing. Save yourself some money and just say the word ""sex"" out loud about 3 hundred times and call it watching the movie.",1229731200,6,434,4.178571428571429
756735,5,6304005571,"If you want some good solid laughs, you've got to see this unexpectedly hilarious movie! On the surface, you'd think that The Love God? is going to be the worst clinker in movie history. The editor of a failing bird magazine falls into the hands of a manipulative smut peddler who turns Peacock Magazine into a sexual revolution Playboy knock-off.

However, with a cast of great comedic talents and a script that will keep you laughing all the way through, The Love God? surprisingly rates as one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Nat Hiken is a comedy genius who brought laughs to Sargeant Bilko, one of the best sitcoms of all-time. I've loved Anne Francis since Forbidden Planet and there are few baby boomers who did not adore her as Honey West in 1965.

But the real magic of this film comes from the amazing Don Knotts, whose comedic skills blow everyone else off the screen. Don Knotts is the Jim Carrey of his era. Just seeing Don Knotts facial expressions are worth the price of the DVD.

The best plot twist of the film puts the enamored Anne Francis into the position of having to seduce Don Knotts for business reasons because the story is about to be leaked that The Love God is, in reality, a virgin!
(And she attempts to do it in a huge bed with a gigantic headboard of a cartoonish heart AND a scoreboard on display -- trying to convince him that it was her first time as well.)

Don't miss this film!",1197590400,3,1422,4.436781609195402
756736,4,6304005571,"Before there was Jim Carey, believe me, there was Don Knotts.

Jim is a master at contorting his face in any number of comical ways

but let's face it...then there is Don Knotts.

Don wrote the BOOK on facial hysteria! His numerous facial twitches, bug-eyed wonder and slack-jawed dumbfoundedness are a thing to behold.

And all of it is wonderfully on display in The Love God?

Don plays the meek editor of a bird magazine which has fallen upon hard times and just like that a saviour arrives in the personage of a rather seedy, slimey girly magazine publisher who manipulates poor Abner(Knotts) into turning his beloved Peacock magazine into a SMUT publication!

Well, one thing turns into another and before you know it Abner is leading a swinging lifestyle complete with his own Peacock clubs and a posse of Pussycat girls at his beck and call. And, the real love of his life, the ministers' daughter RoseEllen left back home waiting .....and waiting, for Abner to come home.

Abner is strung along in his new publishing venture by a fast city slicker editor by the name of Miss Lisa Lamonica played by Anne Francis.

As much of a tour-de-force that Knotts is, leaving us in stitches as he muggs his way through the grand musical number performed at the Peacock club, it is all equaled by the talent and charm of miss Francis. With her trademark beauty mark at the corner of her smile Anne is sharp, funny, beautiful and sexy all rolled into one. This movie cemented my attraction to her and now i want to see every movie she's been in!

In summation...if you want to laugh till it hurts watching Don do his thing and be smitten by the lovely miss Francis, try The Love God?

756805,4,6304005571,"In the Don Knotts canon, ""The Love God?"" occupies a unique place--not only because of its adult slant on sex, but because the ensemble cast is the strongest Don ever had. Edmund O'Brien and Anne Francis had both been feature stars, and they are ably abetted by a half-dozen vivid supporting actors. (The best of these is the great James Gregory as a legendary First Amendment attorney. What scenery chewing! You will never forget the sneering contempt in Gregory's voice as he defends ""this filthy little degenerate"" in court.)

By portraying the Swinging Sixties and its sexed-up icons as silly creations no more ""with it"" than the Silent Majority they mocked, ""The Love God?"" actually stands up pretty well for today's viewer. Plus it's fun to watch Don tricked out in mod fashions, making the scene in those groovy nightlife montages!

I think you'll enjoy this quirky mixture of ""Austin Powers"" and ""The Trial of Larry Flynt,"" especially when it makes clear just how seriously many people took these issues at the time.",1170374400,2,1023,4.907514450867052
756806,4,6304005571,"Sooner or later someone is going to rediscover Don Knotts, a comic genius who made four really funny films in the sixties:  The Reluctant Astronaut, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, The Shakiest Gun in the West, and The Love God. Honestly, Laurel and Hardy have nothing on Don Knotts in terms of comic timing and delivery, and he could teach Jim Carrey a thing or two about discipline and creating a character.  This one has a great cast.  Edmund O'Brien is great as a seedy girlie magazine publisher, and Anne Francis is so lovely that after it was over I sent her my very first fan letter.  This is the most satirical of Knotts' films, and satire isn't always laugh-out loud funny, but even when the material falters a little, watching what Knotts does with it is pure pleasure.  Abner Peacock is a great comic creation, a true innocent in a world of hustlers and exploiters, an American Candide caught in the culture war that continues to this day.",1103328000,15,945,4.568047337278107
756807,5,6304005571,"The Love God is not only hilarious, it's a bit of an eye-opener, as well.  I was perplexed when I saw the PG-13 rating attached to the film just before it began.  For one thing, you don't expect a classic Don Knotts movie to be PG-13 material; for another thing, I don't remember ever seeing an old movie retroactively being given a PG-13 rating.  Don't get me wrong here.  The Love God is quite tame by today's standards, but it deals with sexuality and censorship in a surprisingly upfront way.  I was amazed just to hear the word sex repeated multiple times throughout the film - obviously, the sexual revolution of the 60s was in full swing by 1969, but it's almost surreal to see a Don Knotts film that is ostensibly about that very subject.  I should make it clear that this film, while taking some amazing detours through the free and sexually conscious streets of town, does find its way back home to small-town America and its traditional values.  Virtue and honor are put to the test here, but they prove equal to the task in the end.

Poor Abner Peacock (Don Knotts) is the fourth-generation publisher of the Peacock, a magazine devoted to birds.  We see Peacock show off his personal bird-calling skills at the beginning of the movie, but he can't whistle up the tens of thousands of dollars he needs to save his magazine.  Enter one Osborn Tremaine (Edmond O'Brien), notorious peddler of smutty magazines; his investment saves the magazine, and in a matter of hours Peacock is happily on his way to the jungles of Brazil to try to get the first photograph ever of the world's most elusive bird.  Tremaine, in Abner's convenient absence, quickly changes the Peacock into a girlie magazine; when the authorities come calling with an indictment for peddling smut, it is poor, ignorant Abner who finds himself on trial.  His arrest sparks waves of protest all over the world, and the trial is transformed into a fight over freedom of speech.  The end result of it all is to make Abner Peacock the most famous swinger of his day; he's got more mojo working than Austin Powers, despite the fact that poor Abner is still the same old shy, regular little guy with a sweet and innocent girl waiting for him back in Peacock City.  Knowing the next issue of the Peacock is going to sell like hotcakes thanks to all the publicity, Tremaine is forced to bring in an outside investor by the name of J. Charles Twilight (better known as ""Icepick"" Charlie).  He also hires publicity-craving Lisa LaMonica (Anne Francis) to be the new editor.  So many powerful forces working in tandem compel Peacock to hang around a while, and he settles into the life of a famous playboy.  It is hilarious to watch the progression of shy Abner into the world's most famous swinger - and those outfits!

Dear, sweet Rosa Ellen still waits for him back at home, but Peacock seems unable to leave his lavish new lifestyle; indeed, his business partners are pretty darn determined that he not leave because it would mean the end of the fortune they are making off his image.  I think the movie ends wonderfully; you pretty much know how things are going to turn out in the end, but The Love God has a pretty effective way of taking you to your expected destination.

This has to be one of the first movies to satirize the hot-button issues of morality and censorship.  The very premise of the film speaks directly to the audiences of today.  You won't find the sort of behavior, nudity, and language of today's films here, but The Love God really was ahead of its time in terms of the issues it addressed.  I assume the nature of the discussion accounts for the PG-13 rating attached to it now, but rest assured you or your kids won't see a single thing here that they haven't seen long, long ago - probably on network television.  This isn't Don Knotts' best film, but it gives you Don Knotts as you've probably never seen him before - and the film is very, very funny.",1102032000,29,3948,4.5594900849858355

756812,5,6304005571,"A very funny movie, except that the credits start rolling on the screen before the movie ends. On the DVD At the very end of the movie when Peacock (Knotts) tells the minister that he can get up, the movie ends and starts the rolling credits. When the movie was played on television and showed in theatres, after Peacock tells the minister that he can get up, the next scene shows his wife playing the piano in the church and the choir is singing, and he then starts the bird calls, as he is doing the bird calls the rolling credits start and he continues doing the bird calls until he finishes. This is then the end of the movie. This is left off the DVD edition!! One of the funniest parts of the movie and it's left off. He does the bird calls twice in the movie, not just once as shown on the DVD!!",1065225600,11,802,4.147435897435898
756813,5,6304005571,"Easily Don Knotts' greatest vehicle (not saying much, unfortunately) - a rich script, colorfully tacky sets and cinematography, ""timely"" subject matter, and a hilarious performance from Knotts that will surprise anyone uncertain of his ability to pick films worthy of his talent.  This was Don Knotts' only foray into ""adult"" comedy, and it is rather racy, all things considered,  and compares favorably to the 1950s Tashlin and Jerry Lewis films.",1062547200,3,447,5.371428571428571
