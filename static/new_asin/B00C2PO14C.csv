a Killer Mountain. I probably will not revisit
this movie, but I happen to LOVE these low-
budget movie-of-the-week B-films!",1412726400,,170,4.896551724137931
5688911,4,B00C2PO14C,"I love monster movies.  There were monsters in this movie; unfortunately, they were not featured in a way that would qualify this as a `monster' movie (in spite of the illustration on the DVD cover).  These strange creatures, the guardians of a lost civilization, flit in and out of the darkness on a mountain top (hence the nondescript title).  They are not showcased in any meaningful way.  And.....they are not the only monsters in this movie.
In this sad tale of desperation, a filthy rich guy, dying from brain cancer, spends a fortune to retrieve a possible cure from a supposed Shangri-La like place that might be in or around Killer Mountain.  A lot of people die in the process (and there was never any guarantee that a `cure' even existed in this mythical location).  They based their slim hope on a very old map that suddenly everyone wants and is willing to kill for (resulting in some two-legged monsters showing up very late in the game to add another complication).
The action takes off when a mountain climbing expert (Aaron Douglas) is enticed to lead a new expedition with the bait being his ex-wife led a previous expedition and now she's missing on the mountain (don't see much of an incentive in that, especially considering she's his EX).  Dangers are manufactured at an alarming rate to help pad the story.  It's not something you want to watch and expect logic from.  The `famed' city is only seen at a distance for a blink of the eye.  The `cure' isn't exactly what they expected.
The characters are mostly played by Canadian television actors.  They do well enough with the suspect plot.  I will say it was roughly entertaining; I did like it enough to want to keep it for future viewings.  But it was not as good as it should have been.",1407369600,,1763,4.612179487179487

5688914,3,B00C2PO14C,"The screenplay for this one is straight from the Creature Feature Cliche Notebook. Both the cast of characters and the plot could've been developed from an outline for a hundred other features. I was able to call out what was going to happen next as the film progressed and some of the things the characters did were so stupid they had to have been written in for no other reason than to follow that outline. Shangri-La was there (barely) and the creatures guarding it--lizard-like but at least not Yeti--could reptiles survive at such a high altitude?  The Druks--yes, that's what they were called--are never really seen except in vague silhouette showing teeth and a dragon-like spine, and some slug-like larval stage which is just as deadly as the adults.  Needless to say, the cast follows the usual progression in being picked off one by one in accepted ways most of which are caused by their own stupidity or stubbornness. Some unnecessary violence by a corrupt government official along the way  and the expected conflagration at the end. I vacillated between turning it off and toughing it out but since I had noting better to do, saw it through to the bitter end, and was even less enlightened for it.",1390867200,,1210,4.779904306220096

5688916,3,B00C2PO14C,Killer Mountain is an okay movie.  The first time I saw the movie I was not impressed but I watched it a second time later and it grows on you.  Will never be one of my favorites but something to watch when you need to hear noise in the background.,1376611200,,248,3.94
5688917,2,B00C2PO14C,"A dying millionaire sends his son and a team of climbers up a dangerous Bhutanese mountain to find the lost kingdom of Shambalah, where he believes his illness can be cured. Too bad that the mountain is infested with insectoid dragon-like creatures who eat anyone dumb enough to come skulking around. Matters are further complicated by a local military commander who takes his own interest in the mountain and it's legends to dangerous yet predictable extremes.

These direct-to-video sci-fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
NOBODY. This movie is so cheap that there is literally nobody noteworthy in it.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Pretty solid. The monsters don't leave their mountain so going to them is basically the only way to get killed. Also the lost, highly advanced kingdom everyone is looking for is just a sad, monster-filled ruin that everyone looks at from a distance because exploring it would cost too much.

Carnage:
The monsters eat some people and even drag down a helicopter, but none of it is very exciting.

Awful Effects:
The monsters actually look pretty good- all black and withered from the cold, and covered in dangerous spikey bits. Like all syfy films however, this one insists on using CG for aircraft, gunfire, and just about everything else that costs money, resulting in a lot of effects that COULD have been believable practical effects looking super fake instead.

Romantic Subplot:
As is common in this film the hero and heroine are a divorced couple that doesn't really fight- this saves the screenwriters the effort of relationship building since the threat of monster mayhem is enough to push the starstruck lovers back together. In this case though they just go off as friends, so surprising realism I guess.

Big Action Truck:
In spite of the abundant rugged terrain on offer here, nobody has a big action truck.

Pedantic, small looking, and totally by-the-numbers, Killer Mountain marries lazy writing to contrived storytelling to give us a big old slice of forgettable. Just watch the first half of Rodan for the same general idea but better.",1372723200,7,2186,5.019337016574585

I am a huge fan of the SYFY channel and there movies, I cant help it but I love them. So when this gem was released I was all about it. Unfortunately I missed it on TV so I had to get the DVD which of course I had to have. It stars Aaron Douglas of Battlestar Gallactica fame as a climber who is called back into action when a wealthy businessman hires him to lead a team up a mountain on a rescue mission. To add to it his ex wife was the one who lead the failed climb that he must go rescue.

All is not as it seems though as the business man has ulterior motives, there is something on that mountain that he wants. But there is something else up there that is protecting it with lethal force. Something may have happened to that first team and the new one is climbing right into it. Now with any SYFY flick you can expect bad effects which there are many here but I have to say that I thought the creatures looked pretty good. The acting is good for this type of flick and may actually be better than most, at least from some of the actors. The film was written by Peter Sullivan [Chupacabra vs. The Alamo] and director Sheldon Wilson [Kaw] and it does exactly what it should, be SYFY goodness.

I wish there would have been a commentary by the two as a special feature or something but still it was your typical SYFY flick. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys these kinds of flicks. Now I must move on to the next re-watch, been a kick like that lately.",1421884800,,1482,4.103448275862069
