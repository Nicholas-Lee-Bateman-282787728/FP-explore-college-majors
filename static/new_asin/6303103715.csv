562545,5,6303103715,"The first scene is of a bird caught in a snare fluttering madly to escape, then a hand rescues the bird and lets it free.
Bresson depicts the utter malice than can lay behind a rural community to the abject meanness of poverty.

Asked to sing along in school, her voice was pretty until she hit the high notes and then she was ostracized by her teacher. What was there ever in her life to sing about? Altho at home, doing her chores her voice shines with sweetness

And her only moment of joy on the amusement park car flirting with possibly the only smile in her life, taken away in exchange for a night with a poacher.

It's amazing how her everyday face is a frown, except when she is tending to her dying mother when her face is beautifically transformed to absolute love and adoration.

And I don't believe Bresson asks you to feel sorry for her. He is just showing  us.
 Mouchette  finally needs to confess something to her mother, possibly the only time she has asked for help or advice but at that moment , her mother dies.
That day, an old lady in town gives mouchette a shroud for her mother and a beautiful  dress, the kind you might wear to confirmation or a baptism. She has had  only had tattered rags and ill fitting clunky shoes all her life.
Altho my description may sound melodramatic, the movie is not. It doesn't try to play on your emotions.
The last scene is haunting and unforgettable.
This is a most beautiful movie.",1055289600,13,1440,4.383458646616542
562546,5,6303103715,"i've only watched it twice but so many moments are burned into my memory forever.  it's something ineffable in the tilt of every shot, the slow, predestined precision of every movement of the figures ('actors' is not the right word for a bresson movie), the supernatural evocativeness of every facial expression, the densely but subtly arranged, teasing interplay of sound and image that builds up through the whole film until both sound and image come to an end in the only suicide on film that is truly a miracle.  each moment is an icon painted on slate and clearly visible only by the light of a candle in its own chamber in a dark and infinite church to which my mind will always have access though i'll never know the way there.",993340800,6,734,4.553030303030303
562547,5,6303103715,"I'd seen a bunch of Bresson films before I ever heard of Mouchette, and had always regarded him as the director who, while I wouldn't necessarily want to watch his films to the exclusion of anyone else's, speaks to what's  best in me; Bresson's work has an uncompromising directness that no other  film-maker has ever matched, in my experience.  Watching his films, you  feel that something is being imparted to you that you needed to know; in  this respect, he's utterly unlike the vast majority of directors, who seek  merely to provide diversion and laffs.  His influence on Scorsese,  Fassbinder and Kaurismaki is undeniable, and Paul Schrader has blatantly  ripped him off on more than one occasion (though we forgive Schrader  because he is himself such a good director).
Mouchette is not the most  famous of Bresson's films but it's one of the best I've seen - though  admittedly this is misleading, as most of Bresson's films after the late  40s are masterpieces.  Mouchette's life is almost unrelentingly awful; her  mother is dying, and most of her verbal contact with Mouchette consists of  orders to look after the baby and get her some more gin; her father takes  whatever money she earns, and her brother never says anything at all.  She  lives in a grotty village in a totally unattractive-looking part of  Provence, where the local boys have nothing better to do than drop their  pants in her direction, and where her sole recreation is throwing mud at  her schoolmates.  Nadine Nortier, one of a string of non-professional  actors to be burdened with carrying a Bresson movie, is stunning as the  teenaged Mouchette.  Few cinematic leading ladies have been so utterly  unglamorous.  Her hair is straggly and greasy-looking, her clothes are  outsized hand-me-downs and her shoes are enormous clogs that clack loudly  as she walks, yet Nortier never loses contact with Mouchette's livid anger  and spiritual dignity.  When professional actresses cry, they tend to  crease up their faces and emote; Nortier stares blankly into the middle  distance as the tears stream down her face.
Mouchette is an  extraordinary film, not one to be watched as part of a night of videos,  unless the other videos also happen to be directed by Bresson.  It's one of  Bresson's most unrelentingly sombre films, but the outcome, although  tragic, is not nihilistic (as, arguably, was the director's later study of  disaffected youth, ""Le Diable probablement"").  Not a feelgood  movie, but by no means a nothing-means-anything movie, either, which is a  considerable achievement by anyone's standards, and by the standards of  contemporary movies, an outright miracle.",963532800,17,2662,5.076566125290023
562548,5,6303103715,"Robert Bresson is a great film maker. He influenced all those who followed him (even though no one could truly imitate Bresson), and he changed the way we viewed culture before him. A modest artist perhaps, but one whose  work blew open doors that had remained shut. He dedicate himself to themes  film rarely dealt with: suicide, religion, rape. MOUCHETTE deals with all  three. Too often described as a Jensenist -- and Bresson himself encouraged  such a qualification, Bresson is in fact a neo-Baroque film maker. His  worldview is dark, yet never bleak. Mouchette kills herself yes, still  Bresson makes her a saint. Not a martyr but a modern saint. Opposites  collide all the time in this film where syntheses never come easy (if they  come at all). Bresson is one of the few film makers one we recognize  immediately: one can tell a Bresson image the same way one recognizes a  musical score by Mozart. This is the sign of genius. Bresson created his  medium, it did not create him. - Antonio D'Alfonso (1 March 2000).",951868800,6,1024,4.728813559322034
562549,5,6303103715,"Bresson sets up every shot as if it were a painting. The composition throughout is beautiful. The acting is typical Bresson fare: blank, subdued, but suggestive of enormous repressed emotion. Jean-Luc Godard's  second wife has a small role as a sought after bar-maid. The lead  performance is flawless. The ending is acutely disturbing. Wonderful  wonderful film.",918086400,6,363,5.446428571428571
562678,3,6303103715,"I love Bresson's films! Let's get that out of the way please.

I appreciate his vague sentimentality that he projects in his work.

I consider Mouchette to be his weakest effort mainly due to my personal taste I guess. I don't think this is a bad film per say. I just couldn't connect to it as much as I wanted to! I didn't feel overtly bad for Mouchette everytime something bad happened to her. All I could say in those instances was ""oh that sucks"" and then move on. I felt her tears were of those of crocodiles. I simply didn't get the whole empathy people have for Mouchette based on the many reviews I read.
I understand that Bresson used amateur actors and perhaps that was the problem for me. Perhaps! I could appreciate non-actors like in the films of Carlos Reygadas. But for some reason I couldn't feel the same way about this one from Bresson.

Oh well, this proves that even with your favorite movie director there will always be one or two films that you just can't get into for whatever reason.",1248998400,2,1008,4.408602150537634
562679,5,6303103715,"Based on a novel by George Bernanos, ""Mouchette"" is a sad, deceptively simple tale of a peasant girl whose misfortunes multiply and eventually lead her to an especially grim fate. As always, Bresson's visual austerity and utter absence of contrivance or sentimentality give this moving film a patina of solemn grace. Mouchette, as played by non-pro Nortier, is a victim whose pose of contempt for those around her masks a profound inner sorrow. A key scene at an amusement park--the girl's one joyous, carefree outing--is iconic and one of Bresson's most dizzying master strokes.",1182988800,2,579,5.170212765957447

562681,2,6303103715,"I was quite disappointed with this film.  The director used some non-actors to play some of the parts, and it shows.  Also, the editing and camera work is shoddy.  In one particular scene, you see Mouchette turning her body, which causes a coffee cup to move toward the edge of the table.  In the next shot, the cup falls to the floor.  The effect is very self-conscious and clumsy.  Finally, the actress playing the girl fails to convince us of her state of mind that occurs at the fim's end.

562683,5,6303103715,"This is my favourite Bresson film because I think his minimalist style works to its greatest effect here leading to a finale which is unexpected and forced me to deeply contemplate what I had just witnessed.  The film does have that transcandental quality that I have come to love from Bresson which signals an ambitious attempt to be slightly moralistic without seeming to be.  Mouchette is a character who I will never forget in cinema.

The criterion treatment is very good indeed although I have yet to sample the commentary.  A rare glimpse of Bresson at work directing the actors is a real treat.

For those comparing this to other releases of the same film, the very end of the film keeps the slightly strange looping of the water ripples which I don't believe is meant to be noticed.  It does seem less noticeable in this version though.",1171152000,3,845,4.675675675675675
562684,5,6303103715,"I'm not sure that what is most unique and remarkable about Bresson is his ""spiritual style,"" as it is often described.  One might say that by showing life in all its harshness his work opens the viewer to a vision of its ""fallen state"" and to the way in which a kind of grace is exhibited in the stubborn refusal of his central characters to cave in to the ways of the world even in the face of harsh adversity.  (Even here, Mouchette's final seemingly tragic act is shown to be in many ways a joyous one, the work of a child at play, whose counterpart in the film is the exuberant bumper car ride, where she laughs and flirts even as she is jolted and tossled about by the shock of being continuously smashed by other cars).  Still, what seems most distinctive about his films is not so much the subject matter as the deliberate lack of pretense in its style, which amounts almost to a kind of refusal to let himself as filmmaker or storytelling conventions intrude on the blunt portrayal of life.

While you can certainly reconstruct the events portrayed in this film in terms of a standard plot structure, Bresson seems unwilling to plot out the story of Mouchette; in an interview contained on this dvd he says to a reporter that if he could sum up what happens to Mouchette it would be absurd to make a movie of it.  He aims only to give the essentials, showing no more than what is absolutely necessary, with the implication that as viewers we feel as though the world we are shown piecemeal is much bigger and more complete than what we are permitted to see.  It is not so much ""Mouchette's story"" that we are allowed to see as ""Mouchette's world"": a small world, with a few recognizable places, and recognizable routines, a few places she is permitted to go by a domineering father, and by a mother and brother whose needs place great but uncoerced demands upon her, and a few places she goes on her own, in acts of deliberate defiance, and at the same time acts of seeking someone who will not judge her or use her or place demands upon her.  Because it feels like the world we enter with Bresson's films is not merely a story that is being told (even when, as in this case, it happens to be adapted from a story that had been written down by Georges Bernanos), it is something that endures, something that remains with the viewer (at least this one) long after the final image has faded.

In all of his films, but this one feels unique and special in this respect, Bresson achieves something more than merely fiction.  This is not an ""enjoyable"" filmgoing experience, and his aim is neither to uplift or to provide a message or entertain, but simply to show.  This film is entertaining and surprising in its own way, but in the sense that it is an endless source of surprise and wonder when Bresson refuses to employ cliches of any sort and yet manages to make the events he portrays directly intelligible, without any hint of manipulation of audience emotions or expectations.  Not to be missed by anyone who is interested in the potentials of film, or  in the artistic recreation of life in both its everyday and its tragic dimensions.",1170720000,22,3147,4.472949389179756
562685,5,6303103715,"Another Bresson masterpiece, presented in a beautiful Criterion edition with good extras about the shooting of the film.

The young girl, who as all Bresson characters are not professionals, does an amazing job just being who she is: an innocent young girl.

This movie is sad to the max, specially since the victim is this disprotected young person. We can identify with her all the time, with her isolation, her giving herself for the good of others. Her sacrifice. Her solitude. She's almost a Christlike figure. Bresson admitted during the shooting of this film that he certainly was a believer to the question of whether it was a religious film.

Mouchette, it has been said, is a crossroads among Bresson's works.. Once again he returns to another catholic - the author Georges Bernanos (diary of a country priest).

He made a film that equals his previous one, 'au hasard balthazar', in its immediacey and subtlety and moreover, deep sadness...

Mouchette is the ultimate Bressonian figure - she does not fit in with her society- and bears many hardships with almost christ like perserverence.. But ultimately, like christ, she succombs to the evils of this society.. Her suicide, while it might be considered wrong by some, is the ultimate statement of self.. here.. she is, like Balthazar, saintly and pure..

562687,5,6303103715,"Robert Bresson is one my top favorite directors . And this work is one of the best achievements in his brief but remarkable filmography .
Mouchette is simply one of the most powerful films ever made . After you have watched the last shot , you will convince by yourself we are not in the better of the possible worlds.
The story turns around Mouchette a child without love an emotional orphan , her little story and brief stage in this world is a brutal and penetrating reflection about us and our little miseries .
The Bresson camera is pure poetry . The triviality in the simple fact to serve sugar in a cup over and over talks by itself . The trivialty , the absurdity in the attraction park , and the terible events in which Mouchette is involved become in a perpetual deja vu for the listener .
As you know so well , Bresson is very austere in the verbal codes . He prefers the images become in the real actor , that's why many times the audience is serioulsy disturbed due there are several sequences entirely mude . Bresson is more worried in the powerful and expressive visual force working out as a silent witeness . His camera is a merciless eye but also a fascinating traveler guide who accompanies us in the mythical journey employing the simple reality but that is Bresson's genius touch ; he makes a simple image acquires an epic or tragic dimension and that artistic triumph is done with a clear resource economy.

7838019,5,6303103715,"This film, based on the novel by G. Bernanos, is a moving portrait of an outcast. Mouchette is a member of a poor family. Her mother is sick and her father survives only by poaching and smuggling. She is badly dressed and has no genuine footwear (a painted bird). She is continuously humiliated and insulted by other kids and by those who wield a certain power in the village, like her teacher or the Christian bourgeoisie.
Yet, she is the embodiment of real Christian virtues such as poverty and innocence. The purity of her feelings is beautifully illustrated in the sequence of the fair with its bumper cars.
In her story 'That particular Summer', Marie Cardinal (who plays the mother in this movie) paints a far from hagiographic portrait of Bresson: an awkward, insufferable and callous man. Nevertheless, with his sober style, (apparently) without any passion and a far cry from big theatrical gestures, Robert Bresson created a really disturbing masterpiece. He stigmatizes in a fierce way the human community, which tramples mercilessly on the underprivileged.

7838020,4,6303103715,"I continue to admire and appreciate Bresson, without being able to embrace some of his films completely.  But there is enough power in his all work that, as with Antonioni and other film-makers I've tusseled with internally, I'll keep returning to his works and see how my reactions grow and change over time.

Mouchette is the touching, sad story of a 14 year old girl who is truly and outsider. She is scorned at school, friendless, poor, struggling to cope with with a dying mother who demands mothering herself, a baby bother she has to do almost all the care-taking for, and angry drunkard of a father. Mouchette has understandably retreated within herself, attempting to cut off her emotions, although her tears sometimes come through (tears that I will admit distracted me by looking slightly phony, like a make up effect.)

Ultimately the girl walks away from it all for a night.  She has a complex nighttime encounter with a drunk, epileptic and possibly dangerous poacher that changes her deeply.  Suddenly she is more aware of the world around her, her own burgeoning sexuality, how people treat her, each other and the natural world.  Her tears come more freely.  All of this leads to an ending that is both moving, and just slightly mysterious in the way it is shot. '

I was never bored, always interested, and touched.  But I wasn't as deeply effected as most professional critics and film-writers seemed to be, nor did the underlying ideas feel that complex, or hard to decipher.  That said, as with all Bresson's deceptively simple work, I could well see my reaction being even stronger on a 2nd viewing.",1460332800,,1621,4.798561151079137

Notice her tenderness towards her baby brother and the poacher.  Notice her completely selfless joy and enthusiasm on the bumper cars.  Yet there must be a long history of negativity between her family and these villagers we viewers are not privy to.  The hostile reactions of classmates, teachers, and shopkeepers just don't make any sense at all based only upon her own behaviors.  Mouchette was dealt a lousy hand in life.  It gets drastically worse during the few hours this ""slice of life"" span.  Things seem random and abrupt because that is the way a 14 year old experiences the world.",1437955200,,731,4.65625
7838022,5,6303103715,"Robert Bresson's 1967 masterpiece Mouchette is the second of two adaptations he made of novels by the French Catholic and staunch monarchist writer Georges Bernanos. The first was Diary of a Country Priest (Journal d'un cur de campagne), a film made in 1951 and considered by many (including Andrei Tarkovsky no less) as the greatest spiritual work ever committed to celluloid. For me that is Bresson's most difficult film and I will come back to a comparison between it and Mouchette when I review it later. For now, I think it more enlightening to draw parallels between Mouchette and its immediate predecessor, Au hasard Balthazar (1966). This was the one and only time in Bresson's career where he made two films in quick succession (securing funds was a perennial problem for him) and similarities between the two are so close that one could be considered a loose reworking of the other.

Both films are set in the French countryside and address the poverty of village life in a direct and accusatory manner that provoked French audiences upon first release. Mouchette in particular caused consternation with its story of a poor teenage girl (the Mouchette of the title) who endures a miserable existence, one which she can escape in the end only by killing herself. Apparently, in the world according to Robert Bresson death is preferable to life in a French village and the outrage caused by the film's release is understandable, especially when the parents of Nadine Nortier (the girl who plays Mouchette) complained long and loud about Bresson's usage of their daughter.

Like the poor donkey Balthazar, Mouchette is forced to negotiate the 7 Stations of the Cross on the way to her Calvary - her final redemption and her attainment of grace. The Biblical Passion-like allegory of Au hasard Balthazar is made very obvious by the donkey being born in a barn and undergoing a journey rife with obvious (and many not so obvious) references to the gospels. In Mouchette, the parallels are less clear, but anyone who has seen Au hasard will grasp that we are dealing with exactly the same territory. The donkey went through 7 owners in his negotiation of the Cross from birth to death. We come into Mouchette's life 15 years after her birth and find her Stations of the Cross consist of dealing with the various tormentors that surround her. She has to look after her dying mother (Marie Cardinal) and tend for her baby sibling. She has to deal with the bullying of her alcoholic bootlegger father (Paul Hebert) who treats her like a piece of his property. She has to suffer the humiliation of her school teacher who reduces her to tears by forcing her to sing in tune in front of class. She is used as an alibi by the tramp Arsne (Jean-Claude Guilbert who plays virtually the same role in Au hasard - the only Bresson model to appear in more than one of his films) to escape a murder charge before being raped by him. She has to suffer an inquisition by the gamekeeper Mathieu (Jean Vimenet) and his wife as to why she stayed overnight with Arsne in his hovel and is pushed into a confession to having been sexually violated. Then after her mother's death she has to suffer the stares of nosy village neighbors - the shopkeeper who gives her coffee to satisfy her prying curiosity, a pious undertaker who gives her a sheet to wrap her mother's corpse in for the funeral and then boys who flash her in the street for fun. `Mouchette' is a colloquial French word meaning `little fly' and that is exactly how she is treated by everyone around her. It's difficult to think of a character in another film who suffers like Mouchette. Like Balthazar and of course like Jesus Christ Himself, she takes on her suffering for the sake of us all. Of all the models that appear for Robert Bresson, Nadine Nortier gives a 'performance' (if that's what we can call it - it's more like a luminous `presence') which is the most heart-breaking of all. Once you have seen this film and have empathized with Mouchette, her face will stay with you forever.

I have highlighted similarities between Bresson's two pastoral masterpieces, but in two radical ways they are very different. Firstly, Balthazar is an animal and is therefore `pure' and `innocent', the cruelties of man being refracted through him to the soft sounds of Schubert. Mouchette is an adolescent girl, and though she is innocent to a degree, she is also tough and answers insults with insolence. As per usual Bresson isn't interested in the psychology of how she is a victim of her social environment. Rather he continues with his Jansenist predestinarian belief that her fate has already been decided and she will gain redemption irrespective of whether she is `good' or `bad'. Therefore, Bresson doesn't hesitate to strip her character of any kind of sentimentality to make a film which is as harsh as any I have ever seen. Almost all the bad things that happen to her are answered back by Mouchette in kind. She insults her father when she goes out to find milk against his orders. She throws mud at her classmates who bully her. She refuses to sing for her teacher - at first we think the teacher is bullying her, but later we find out she can sing the same song perfectly well at home and was just being insolent earlier. She at first fights Arsne's sexual advances before seeming to acquiesce to them (watch her hands caress his back). She throws back the shopkeeper's charity in her face, she grinds mud into the undertaker's carpet and then finally she thumbs her nose at God Himself by self-destructing - remember suicide is forbidden by the Catholic Church. And yet, as the beautiful Monteverdi music (the Magnificat from the 1610 Vespers) tells us, she attains grace nevertheless. Mouchette is no innocent angel in Bresson's hands and her suffering (and how she makes others suffer in return) routes her very firmly in the reality of French country life. In this sense she becomes less like Balthazar and more like Marie, the heroine of Au Hasard who undergoes a comparable decline albeit without exhibiting any of Mouchette's insolence.

The second difference lies in the different narrative structures of the two films. Au hasard is Bresson at his most elliptical. A myriad of stories take place around the donkey. As he suffers we are propelled forward in time over a number of years with quite extraordinary swiftness. The complexity of the narrative is awe-inspiring in how much Bresson manages to squeeze into 90 minutes. By contrast Mouchette is extremely simple. The action takes place over just a few days and the story of Mouchette's victimization is rendered straight and direct in the manner of a Biblical parable. Au hasard has us casting around, playing detective to spot the clues to piece together the various stories that occur while Mouchette is built out of very clearly defined scenes which are precisely designed with impeccable balance to chart the girl's advance towards redemption.

The film opens with a monologue delivered straight to camera by Mouchette's mother sitting in a chair. She says ""What will become of them without me? I can feel it in my breast. It's like a stone inside"". On one level 'them' means her family and 'it' is the cancer that is killing her. But the fact that we don't know who this character is yet, that she rises after speaking to reveal her to be in a church, and that the camera remains fixed on the empty chair as the credits play to the Monteverdi on the soundtrack would appear to suggest a much more universal meaning to her words. Could she represent the Virgin Mary (everyone's Mother) so that 'them' means everyone living in the village (in the world?) and 'it' is the cancer (the evil) killing off society around them? Without belief in God and the existence of the love of man for man society is in danger of extinction.

It is this endangered society which Bresson goes on to depict throughout the film. Notice the framing sequences depicting hunting both immediately after the opening credits and immediately before Mouchette's suicide. The gamekeeper Mathieu is ostensibly trying to stop Arsne poaching on (presumably) private property. Actually they are both dueling with each other for the attentions of the local barmaid Luisa (Marine Trichet). She is presented by Bresson as what Mouchette would turn into in the future, another woman who is hunted, spied on and trapped by a patriarchal society. Women are the objects of the hunt, not the animals.

Bresson's perception of women being at the mercy of a patriarchal society (the hunt) is crystallized beautifully in the key fairground sequence which happens one Sunday morning after a church service. Mouchette leaves her father boozing away at his caf table to play on the dodgems. There she encounters (in a brilliantly edited, wonderfully lyrical little scene) a young man. They enjoy bashing into each others' cars. Then something miraculous happens. Mouchette smiles! It is like the sun bursting through dark and oppressive clouds. Encouraged, she approaches the man who is now standing at a shooting gallery (more hunting!) still wearing the same shy smile. Immediately the smile is wiped off her face by the harsh slap of her father who pushes her back into her place at the table sitting by his side. Tears silently roll. It is a devastating truly heart-breaking moment - one of the very greatest in all of Bresson's films. The director doesn't stop there either, for at the same time we have Mathieu again trying to come on to Luisa in the bar (while his wife sits outside!) and then jealously watching her take a ride with Arsne on another of the fairground attractions. Bresson here gives us another hunting ground with men controlling (or seeking to control) the women around them. We realize Luisa is a grown-up version of Mouchette and that Mouchette's situation will never change if she doesn't leave the village. But the village is her world and leaving it is a step beyond her capability. All she can do is yield to self-sacrifice. This is the sickness of the patriarchal society which Bresson depicts in his film. At the end as Mouchette wanders into the forest after losing her mother she observes more rabbits being hunted. Harsh gunshots ring out as if they are being fired at her and the parallel with her own suffering is obvious.

The ending is unbearably harsh and depressing, and yet Bresson gives it an astonishing sense of spiritual purity by having Mouchette wrap herself in the shroud meant for her dead mother, by having the sun shine gloriously down on a beautiful scene by the brook, by having her wave (seemingly hopefully) at a farmer on a tractor in a moment of almost clichd pastoral tranquility and then by the concluding burst of Monteverdi after she splashes into the water. Her soul has ascended to heaven and we are left gutted but exhilarated - that is the sign of quintessential Robert Bresson.

Bresson didn't stay hopeful for long however. Mouchette was his last b/w film and the last which has its main character achieve a firm sense of grace. The misanthropy evidenced in parts of Au hazard and most of Mouchette becomes all-pervasive in the color films that follow as Bresson seems to give up on the condition of his fellow man for good. Characters still engage on an unknowing search for spiritual release, for redemption as per their predestined fate, but this will only be found in acts of suicide or of anti-social violence. For example, in the director's bleak and desolate final film L'argent (1983) one disenchanted man axes a whole family to death in the name of spiritual release and Bresson posits the resulting imprisonment and possible capital punishment as the agents of his redemption.

Mouchette is a tough film, depressing and uplifting in equal measure. Not everyone will be prepared for Bresson's brutality, but the film is a masterpiece and one of the director's key works. As I have said earlier, I recommend watching Au hasard Balthazar first before you see it. You will appreciate Mouchette's plight (and the Christ-like parallels between the donkey and the girl) all the more for it. This is a review of the Nouveaux Pictures release which features decent visual quality (aspect ratio 16:9) and adequate sound. There are some problems related to the way the print has been digitally remastered especially in dark scenes where ghosting becomes noticeable. I see Artificial Eye have reissued it recently and that some recommend that transfer for making the very most out of Ghislain Cloquet's extraordinary photography - of all Bresson's films this is perhaps the most beautiful to look at. However, both this and the AE release have no extras. I find that disappointing - surely such a masterpiece deserves a scholarly commentary as well as a thoughtful documentary to bring this elusive director's work more clearly in front of the public eye. For the ideal presentation you can turn to the Criterion region 1 version which features a commentary by the ever-reliable Tony Rayns, a 30 minute documentary (with footage of the great director in action!), the original trailer cut by Jean-Luc Godard and on-set interviews with Bresson, Nortier and Guilbert. However that version is expensive and you will need a multi-region player to see it. The Criterion Robert Polito essay is at least offered gratis on line. Whichever version you choose, this film has to be seen.",1411430400,5,13421,4.84400871459695
7838023,5,6303103715,"Naturally this is a brilliant film. If you can't see it on the screen, this is a pretty close second. The aspect ratio appears to be as close to what I remember the screened version being. The print here looks even better than the print I saw at the Bresson retrospective.

More importantly the extras on this Criterion edition contain a brilliant commentary that explains Breason's links with surrealist and sexual sadist thinkers like George Bataille. I'd have enjoyed to hear more expounded on about this. I've always suspected it as Bresson was friends with Pierre Kosslowski his brother (the brilliant painter) Balthus and Pierre was an intellectual who's focus and primary interests were DeSade and other sexual sadists. Those two brothers were also friends with George Bataille. So I had always assumed there was some kind of link-in addition Pierre actually appeared as a priest in Au Hazard Balthazar (also the full first name of Balthus, the painter and brother of Pierre). All of which naturally made me presuppose. But I never heard or read anything supporting this.

Lastly, there are some excellent documentary supplements with Bresson working with his actors and technicians. Something that is extremely hard to come by.

For all these things along, it's worth the price of this disc.",1386460800,2,1299,5.0607476635514015
7838024,4,6303103715,"Robert Bresson's adaptation of Georges Bernanos novel, `Mouchette', is a film that will quietly sneak up on you, mostly because of the brilliant performance by the young lead, Nadine Nortier.  As Mouchette, Nadine is emotionally heartbreaking, completely fleshing out the loss of innocence this young girl experiences not only because of her circumstances but because of the harrowing situation she finds herself in one cold stormy night.  Bresson does a remarkable job of finding the layers in Mouchette's story, building subtle layers that reach a climax that is shattering.  I do wish that the film breathed a little more.  It feels extremely bleak, much like a Bergman film, but it doesn't have the same breadth of movement that his films have, or the integral dialog needed to make it all feel universally poignant.  Still, this is one you need to see.  It gets beneath your skin and really makes an impact.",1381708800,,912,5.006622516556291
7838025,4,6303103715,"The reason the film does succeed, and rises to greatness, rests primarily on the shoulders of the lead actress, Nadine Nortier, who, despite little dialogue, conveys great depths within her character, despite being a non-professional actress at the time. On the other hand, Jean-Claude Guilbert (a professional actor who also appeared in Au Hasard Balthazar, as another drunkard, Arnold) is also very good. The rest of the cast is solid. Yet, critical missteps abound, especially when some claim Mouchette is filled with anger. Yes, there may be acts of seeming anger (tossing dirt at her female rivals), bur clearly the character of Mouchette is a walking mass of desensitization. This would explain why she reacts the way she does to sex with Arsene, rather than seeing it as her `striking back' at the world. The cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet is not spectacular, but then it need not be. It does, however, have the simple look and feel of a film shot decades earlier, and one need only compare this film with a film like Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai, a color film made the same year, to get a sense of just how unique Bresson's vision was. The same is true for the scoring of the film, with little music that is not diegetic. Since the film rises and falls on its tale and performance, the technical aspects merely have to be solid, and they are.

  The DVD, put out by The Criterion Collection, is a very good package. The transfer of the film is first rate, as the 81 minute black and white film (Bresson's last film sans color) is shown in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The special features are also quite good. They include an insert essay by Robert Polito that is short on critical masturbation, and quite pointed; the film's original theatrical trailer by Jean-Luc Godard which, when seen against the film, is utterly at odds with it; a documentary called Travelling, which is a segment from a tv series called Cinema, and has interviews with Bresson, Nortier and Guilbert; another documentary, called Au Hasard Bresson, about the director; and also an audio film commentary by film critic Tony Rayns which flows very well, is not too scripted, is scene specific in its comments, and conveys both passion and erudition; traits too often missing in most commentaries. His lone weak spot comes when trying to explain (rather justify) the rather weak ending. Rayns claims that death, for the girl, was preferable to life, and that Mouchette had fulfilled her life, with sex and death, in the last day of her life, with the death of the rabbit being the final straw; but there is just no evidence for this, and Rayns, himself, is dubious over Mouchette's reaction, since she is a girl of the rural life, where hunting is a normal activity. And, while that may be what Bresson intended, and what the character may have thought, a critic needs to go beyond merely aping explanations put forth by an artist, especially in matters that so clearly demonstrate an artistic failure, and one which seems to accept, in toto, that failure, merely due to the reputation of the artist as `spiritual,' therefore beyond needing to make his art cohere.

  However, despite that failure, Mouchette is a great film, one whose concision heightens its power, and one whose deftness of portrayal burrows more deeply into matters than its good, but skeletal, screenplay does. One of the best techniques Bresson uses to get more out of each brief scene is through the use of repetitions of actions in unrelated scenes, which then connect those scenes to others. For example, when Mouchette's teacher punishes her and forces her to sing a song, it is under duress. Mouchette sings that same song while trying to tend to a seizing Arsene. Mouchette is pushed by her father whenever she wants pleasure, and she then pushes Arsene before she has sex with him. There is also a scene where Mouchette is wet, working in the bar, and then gets some coins as payment. Later, in his hut, she is wet, and Arsene pays her some coins to go along with his story regarding Mathieu's presumed death. What this does is not only link divergent scenes in a strictly visual and cinematic way, but it emphasizes the elliptical and cyclical nature of the film, where recurring images and motivs abound. Yet, all of them are slightly askew, and the camera always seems to look at its lead character's life slightly askance, as if it was somehow recapitulating the clearly warped view of life  Mouchette owns. In essence, the film called Mouchette recapitulates the point of view of its character Mouchette, which allows the viewer to both `feel' a bit of the character's warp, while also being able to step back and intellectually distance oneself and `understand' the character's warp.

  Whether or not Bresson intended this doubled perspective on life, it, and many of the film's other strengths more than make up for its weak ending, and lift it to a greatness that, while it falls short of the utmost in the canon of great cinema, nonetheless makes Mouchette a film for which the term great is applied a surety. There are, certainly, worse ways to misfire, slightly or otherwise.",1283299200,,5148,4.8133484162895925
7838026,5,6303103715,"Robert Bresson distills the superficial portrait of the archetypal gamin in order to derive the indelibly bleak and caustic cinematic image of Mouchette. Hardly the hapless waif or endearing pixie, Mouchette (Nadine Nortier) is all too human: a slovenly, unremarkable, and asocial adolescent neglected by a terminally ill mother (Maria Cardinal) and an abusive, alcoholic father (Paul Hebert). She hides behind a ravine after school, throwing dirt at other children. She jumps into a puddle in her church clothes on her reluctant way to mass. She purposely tracks mud at a neighbor's rug, after the elderly woman offers to donate clothing for her mother's funeral. But there are also subtly poignant moments of humanity: an abbreviated encounter with a boy at a carnival; concealing her mother's alcohol consumption by adding water to a bottle of gin; attending to the helpless game poacher, Arsene (Jean-Claude Guilbert), who has suffered a seizure. Drawn into complicity by Arsene's seeming kindness, she stays at his house during a rainstorm, and is violated. Returning home, her attempts to recount the painful episode are truncated by her mother's incessant instructions and, eventually, her death. In the morning, attempting to escape the misery of the situation, she leaves the house on an errand, only to find the same cruelty beyond its walls.

Bresson's use of spare and minimal camera work serves a greater purpose than to merely provide a signature style. From the extreme close-ups of the opening scene, showing only Arsene and Mathieu's (Jean Vimenet) eyes, to the headless shots of people in the bar, Bresson creates a metaphor for the fractured soul. Mouchette is profoundly alone, incomprehensibly searching for connection and acceptance, but is answered with betrayal and violence. Note the analogy of the two animal sequences in the film: illustrating the struggle to live, the crushing of the spirit, and the inevitable surrender to its fate. In essence, we are Mouchette - foundering and incomplete - seeking redemption from the misery of existence, incapable of articulating the pain - resigned to our own private hell.",1262736000,,2141,5.278592375366569
7838027,3,6303103715,"The Bottom Line:

After seeing and loving A Man Escaped I got really excited about Bresson but two films later (Pickpocket and this one) I'm not convinced that the first film I saw by him was an aberration and he's a really boring director; Mouchette is a widely praised film but I gotta tell you, it's quite a slog to sit through even at 80 minutes and it never does anything to suck the viewer in to the story.

If you have read the book, Bresson has made a few changes.  The setting is a French community during the mid 60s with a 14 year old teen who is treated as an outcast, and faces cruel experiences not common for a coming of age teen, including the burden at home. She goes home to a dying mother, an alcoholic unattentive father, a brother, and she provides custodial care for a baby brother.

Mouchette attends school where she is not included in activities with the other teens.  She doesn't fit in, is shabbily dressed, and painfully shy, but has few rebellious moments.  One day, walking home through the woods, she is raped by a poacher in the woods.  Another adult experience she faces is to lie during interrogation about a murder between a poacher and gamekeeper.  With the accumulation of treatment and more despair to come, Mouchette makes a shocking decision.

The Criterion film has been improved, subtitles are easy to follow.  What is wonderful is an hour-long  treat to observe Robert Bresson at work with detailed precision.
