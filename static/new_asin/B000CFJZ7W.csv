8098822,5,B000CFJZ7W,"""Grave Danger"" is one of my episode of this series. It was well written and well acted. I will watch it more often now that I have in my cillection.",1383782400,,148,3.966666666666667
8098823,5,B000CFJZ7W,"Movies and TV shows are to entertain!  If it's a thrillr and it scares the heck out of you... it's done it's job.  If it's a personal drama and it makes you cry... that's a good movie.
Now, CSI's Grave Danger.  If you are not, in any way, claustrophobic there is a chance that this episode may only be in your top ten of CSI shows.  But for those of us who are... This movie (yes, movie it had that long of a running time)will have you groaning and turning your head away throughout the grave shots.  For those of us who fear tight, restricted places they added things that would made the stituation beyound comprehenstion.  I came off my TV seat several times. This movie did it's job big time.  For around two hours my emotions where going crazy. It was simply great!  I have talked to dozens of CSI faithfuls and even as we await season 8 on CD, This episode was mentioned as the best by over 95% of them. I'm glad I bought my copy as I understand they are not available right now.  Put your order in... it should be everyone's movie collection.",1223683200,,1048,4.252525252525253
8098824,5,B000CFJZ7W,"By far the best two episodes of the series. The involvement of Tarantino was a real hit.

One of the things that usually happens in series as CSI is that episode after episode, they center on a pattern, bringing in a different eye such as Tarantino's, gives you the unexpected you always want to see in a season finale.

If you don't want to spend a lot buying the entire season 5, this is an excellent option, and it's also a stand alone project.

A most have!",1174003200,4,461,4.275862068965517
8098825,5,B000CFJZ7W,"This is by far the best episode of CSI, despite what the other reviewer on here thinks.  There are a ton of great episodes of CSI, but this is the one and only episode that I will watch over and over.  Quentin Tarantino is such a great writer/director, that he pulls superb performances from the Actor's here.

It was a shame when they followed up on this storyline, in Season 6. It was such a horrible letdown, allowing for only 5 minutes to wrap it up.  They should have asked QT to come back and do a second part.",1155859200,5,516,4.181818181818182
8098826,1,B000CFJZ7W,"This is by far the worst episode of CSI, despite it being constantly heralded as the best.  This episode brought in a big name fan of the show--Quentin Tarantino--and, because of his name, let him write and direct the show's season five finale.  The result of this was a lot of pointless dialogue, worthless scenes that dragged on and on, actors who seemed completely out of their element, characters who were out of character, and the ultimate torture of the beloved Nick Stokes.

While I do give credit to the magnificent acting of George Eads (Nick Stokes) and felt for his character who spent nearly the entire episode in his ""grave"", I feel that's about all there was to this episode.  And that's what the show rode on--the emotional instead of the logical, the reasonable, or the just plain decent.  The show relied on people being worried for Nick's life, and the fact that such a big name fan played a part in it.

Few seem to recognize that that's just what QT is and has always been when it came to CSI--a fan.  Yet, because of his status, his fan fiction story became CSI 'reality' which thus violated the characters' integrity, and their lives forever.  He added out-of-character bits of 'history' to their characters (even giving Nick and his father [who we'd previously been led to believe didn't have the best of relationships] extremely cliche nicknames for each other) that not only didn't fit, but have little value coming from a fellow 'fan' as opposed to the show's regular team of writers.",1151625600,5,1510,4.714828897338403
