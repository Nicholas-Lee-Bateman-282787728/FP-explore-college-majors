6305087,4,B00IY2P5CO,"""Divorce Corp."" (2014 release; 93 min.) is a documentary that takes a closer look at the business of divorce in the US. Yes, business, as we are informed that this is a $50 billion/yr. industry, and the average divorce (including related child custody issues) costs $50,000. As the movie opens, we are introduced to a guy in Cincinnati who tells the tragic story of how his second wife, not long after they have a little boy, pulls the rug from under his feet and is able to not only ruin his finances and reputation but also to keep him from seeing his own son. As the movie progresses, we come to know others (in Memphis, Dallas, etc.) who have similar blood-boiling stories to tell. To tell you more specifics of the documentary would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Couple of comments: first, even though examples are pulled from across the country, the documentary as a whole is heavily California-focused, perhaps not a surprise since it seems California is on the cutting edge of many divorce/custody battle strategies (and they do mean ""battle""). Second, what really gets under your skin is the vested and interlinked interest that EVERYONE involved except the families themselves, has to keep this ""industry"" going and growing. The documentary does a great job contrasting this with the situation in ""Scandinavia"" (mostly examples from Iceland, some from Sweden). Third, kudos to writer-producer-director Joe Sorge for bringing us this riveting, and revolting, assessment of divorce, and family courts in general.

This movie showed up in January on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. I figured this wouldn't be playing long so I went to see it a few days after it opened. I had a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. No matter, this is an excellent documentary. Whether you can check it out in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, ""Divorce Corp."" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394755200,18,1963,4.909638554216867

6305091,5,B00IY2P5CO,People think a prenuptial agreement will solve everything.  It doesn't.  More than 50% of prenups are challenged in court.  Did the co-signer have her own lawyer?  No?  The prenup is thrown out.  Was the co-signer coerced into signing with little time before the wedding?  The prenup is thrown out.  And most prenups do not cover post nuptial career success.  The smarter thing is to put assets into trusts.  Less than 10% of all trusts are challenged in divorce court.  The odds are in your favor.,1493510400,,498,4.741176470588235

6305095,3,B00IY2P5CO,"Eye opening documentary though perhaps a little fragmented in its structure.
One glaring omission was the fact that women initiate 75% of divorces and are overwhelmingly the beneficiaries when it comes to child support and alimony payments. Men are far more likely than women to be incarcerated due to inability to make these payments.
Women are also far more likely than men to abuse the system by making false claims of domestic violence and sexual abuse",1488758400,3,456,5.0131578947368425

6305102,2,B00IY2P5CO,"I just watched this documentary and have walked away with mixed feelings. It is also important to say that I have extensive professional experience with NY Family Court as I work in child welfare.
The first thing that struck me about this documentary is that it has an obvious agenda. So do Michael Moore's movies, so I rolled with it to see the point they wanted to drive home. The bleak and somewhat tilted portrait that the Dr/Director paints here does lead me to wonder why he is so compelled to bring this issue to light. This answer was found when I looked for info regarding his own divorce and the appellate decision of the same. He was apparently ordered to pay a sum in the neighborhood of $750,000 to his ex-wife's legal team when his argument that he had invested his $100 million in businesses that were not generating positive income at the time. All this to increase child support payments to the wife in addition to her $16k/mo alimony. And their child was 14.
Further, I was questioning some of the practices and roles within the court structure that he described. As an example, the film notes that children are sometime appointed a Guardian Ad Litum. In NY, every child is appointed an attorney to represent the child's interest as the parents' attorneys would do on their clients' behalf. I attribute some of these differences to state law but, even still, it takes away from the film that he only focuses on California (where nothing works) and Scandanavia (where everything about divorce works). He does throw in a few extreme cases where people do seem to have been screwed over however, as I have read in another professional review, these are the exceptions used here to sensationalize the point he wants to make.
Overall, I wouldn't call this the worst first effort for a documentarian however it falls far short of insightful and teeters on irrelevant for a large percentage of the population who are actually interested in learning more about this issue. I would not tell someone that they shouldn't watch this film but I would tell them that they should balance it with independent research and healthy questioning of the points that are repeatedly raised.",1469404800,3,2185,4.7678100263852246

6305118,5,B00IY2P5CO,"Most valuable takeaway - family court is not a court of law, it is a court of ""equity"" that is often bought by the most connected law firm involved in the matter.

A second takeaway - permanent alimony generates more legal fees (cost for parties) out of a divorce matter.  Later in life when the parties have some life event that changes income, they need to pay more fees to attorneys for the same matter to get any adjustment to alimony.  There is no consideration given for retirement.  Alimony can be like a life sentence.",1449619200,,526,4.505263157894737

6305121,4,B00IY2P5CO,"How I determined my rating:
__5 Stars for Content
__minus 2 stars for not disclosing that the 10 ""Bonus Features"" have *no* captions and *no* subtitles, so if you are deaf or hard of hearing, you are out of luck with the Bonus Features.
I think that most of the content in the Bonus Features is actually excerpts from the documentary, not additional material.  But that's not the point to me; when anybody is selling me something and I have no way to see the entire product before buying it, I have to take it on faith that ""Format: Closed-captioned"" means everything that I want to see is ""Format: Closed-captioned.""
And I do want to see the Bonus Feature about the paperwork involved in divorce (for example) without having to find where that info is within the closed-captioned documentary.
Plus, the info about the paperwork is from several different parts of the documentary.  So even though the Bonus Features may not be additional content, the content is in a different format because the content has been edited to pull together everything to do with paperwork, for example.
------It doesn't matter to me how many producers of DVDs follow similar practices and provide only audio for their Bonus Features.  I'm not buying those DVDs; I rent the actual DVD (not streaming) from Netflix.  This isn't yet available to rent, so I bought it because I saw the documentary without the extras, and  the documentary was captioned.

__I give the DVD an extra star for providing (in the documentary itself) both real (not pretend) ""closed-captioned"" format and also English subtitles.

Yes, I get to give extra stars when I want to; I learned that from the Amazon reviewers who have gone before me.  :-)",1446422400,2,1700,4.7979452054794525
6305122,5,B00IY2P5CO,"There is so much truth in this movie. It needs to be more available and charging $15 per copy is not a way to do it. Granted you can see it on Netflix, but I believe that copies should be mass-produced and made available in book stores or gift shops in cities where these courts are located. Everyone has time to kill while waiting for the judge to make a decision, walking up and down Main Street and finding this movie would be just the thing to give someone hope in a no win situation.",1444089600,,488,4.147368421052631

The cost of the surrogate for my child was a fraction of what it costs a man in divorce court and I don't go to baby jail for eighteen years.  The suicide rate for men is multiples of that for women with the main reason being loss of their children.

We have an international problem with the judiciary and the manifestations in the Family Court are the tip of the iceberg.  The emotional, social and economic disasters that the judges and grubbing minions fabricate, while taking advantage of folks that are compromised is disgusting.  While this documentary is largely context based, the principles it represents are universal.  This is a must see for everyone, especially those about to get married.

In the United State the constitution provides for a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.  In Family Court wild allegations are enough to strip a healthy and loving parent of their most sacred responsibilities.  A criminal has more legal rights tham a divorcing couple.  The ""broad discretion"" of the courts along with near absolute immunity for all family court professionals makes for epic disasters that continue to spiral our society into an abyss that consumes mind boggling resources and endorse mufti-generational abuse of our children.

There should be a rebuttable presumption of parental rights.  There needs to be a standard or proof, before the court can interfere with the parent child relationship.  The judges and court professionals need to be held accountable for their actions.",1434758400,8,1333,5.422330097087379

Because they're still following archaic rules of law here as if it was the 1950's where all people do not work or have access to jobs.
To have to pay alimony for more years than the actual marriage existed is beyond absurd.
Child support given to the parent to be used any way that they please. Plus the benefit of not paying taxes on this.
Having to go through a divorce can be a nightmare. And, these are just the FINANCIAL aspects that are being discussed.
Places like Scandanavia seem to have the best answer.
Alimony is only limited there to the time period of the actual divorce proceedings. After that, each party goes their separate way free and clear.
Which won't be happening here any time soon.
Because this video makes a very compelling case that it is not in an attorney's best interests to make a quick divorce a reality in the United States. It cuts into their profits.
I was actually surprised, given what they divulged, that so many lawyers were willing to expose the truth of the BIG business of divorce.
As an aside, this dvd is also an indictment on the limitless corruptive power that judges can wield and abuse.
There is no recourse to appeal a decision of a family court judge even if it has been shown to be biased and prejudiced. Who are shown to be involved in cozy relationships with attorneys in blatant instances of conflict of interest.
In one particular year in California, there were 1000 complaints against sitting judges in California.
That resulted in 0 terminations, 0 removals from office, 0 incarcerations and 0 cases of disciplinary action taken against any of them. 0 out of 1000 complaints says all you need to know about the power that can abused.
But, all in all, a DEVASTATING expos.

6305150,4,B00IY2P5CO,"""Destroy the family, and you destroy society."" V. I. Lenin

I live in California where the divorce rate is over 70%,which is a 20% bump above the national average. This movie is a shocker even to the skeptic on how ""family law"" and these judges who think they are gods wreck havoc on peoples lives. My only criticism is that the director even admitted in a interview (link below) that 90% of all child support is paid by men and 95% of ALL alimony is paid by men, yet by the way the documentary is edited it appears to be 50/50 with the sexes. In states where no-fault divorce was introduced, over 70 percent of divorce filings are by women. Among college-educated couples (higher average income bracket), the percentage of divorces initiated by wives soars to 90%.

 The reason for the documentary's more balanced battle of the sexes cut according to director Joseph Sorge is that he was going for wide market appeal, making the movie ""gender neutral"". So in other words showing REAL facts and statistics would be non-PC and his approach would help the sexes unite to demand change of these draconian laws. Women with the same education and resume now earn 94-100% of what the average man makes for the same job, yet this documentary is just one example of many showing how men consistently get the short end of the stick in our society.

 Regardless, like allot of agenda's in this country I believe there is a war by our loving government to destroy the family, therefore the FED GOVT. can be your mommy and daddy and indoctrinate (not educate) your children. I strongly recommend watching this documentary and read the book below which dives into the subject of divorce in detail. I posted on my comments link a interview with the director by Stefan Molyneux which I found interesting as he presses for the statistics that I mentioned above on how the system is stacked against men in the U.S.A.

BE CAREFUL WHO YOU MARRY

  By Stephen Baskerville, Ph. D

Marriage is a foundation of civilized life. No advanced civilization has ever existed without the married, two-parent family. Those who argue that our civilization needs healthy marriages to survive are not exaggerating.

And yet I cannot, in good conscience, urge young men to marry today. For many men, marriage has become nothing less than a one-way ticket to jail. Even the New York Times has reported on how easily ""the divorce court leads to a jail cell,"" mostly for men. In fact, if I have one urgent piece of practical advice for young men today it is this: Do not marry and do not have children.

Spreading this message may also, in the long run, be the most effective method of saving marriage as an institution. For until we understand that the principal threat to marriage today is not cultural but political, and that it comes not from homosexuals but from heterosexuals, we will never reverse the decline of marriage. The main destroyer of marriage, it should be obvious, is divorce. Michael McManus of Marriage Savers points out that ""divorce is a far more grievous blow to marriage than today's challenge by gays."" The central problem is the divorce laws.

It is well known that half of all marriages end in divorce. But widespread misconceptions lead many to believe it cannot happen to them. Many conscientious people think they will never be divorced because they do not believe in it. In fact, it is likely to happen to you whether you wish it or not.

First, you do not have to agree to the divorce or commit any legal transgression. Under ""no-fault"" divorce laws, your spouse can divorce you unilaterally without giving any reasons. The judge will then grant the divorce automatically without any questions.

But further, not only does your spouse incur no penalty for breaking faith; she can actually profit enormously. Simply by filing for divorce, your spouse can take everything you have, also without giving any reasons. First, she will almost certainly get automatic and sole custody of your children and exclude you from them, without having to show that you have done anything wrong. Then any unauthorized contact with your children is a crime. Yes, for seeing your own children you will be subject to arrest.

There is no burden of proof on the court to justify why they are seizing control of your children and allowing your spouse to forcibly keep you from them. The burden of proof (and the financial burden) is on you to show why you should be allowed to see your children.

The divorce industry thus makes it very attractive for your spouse to divorce you and take your children. (Women initiate over 70% of all divorces)  All this earns money for lawyers whose bar associations control the careers of judges. While property divisions and spousal support certainly favor women, the largest windfall comes through the children. With custody, she can then demand ""child support"" that may amount to half, two-thirds, or more of your income. (The amount is set by committees consisting of feminists, lawyers, and enforcement agents - all of whom have a vested interest in setting the payments as high as possible.) She may spend it however she wishes. You pay the taxes on it, but she gets the tax deduction.

You could easily be left with monthly income of a few hundreds dollars and be forced to move in with relatives or sleep in your car. Once you have sold everything you own, borrowed from relatives, and maximized your credit cards, they then call you a ""deadbeat dad"" and take you away in handcuffs. You are told you have ""abandoned"" your children and incarcerated without trial.

Evidence indicates that, as men discover all this, they have already begun an impromptu marriage ""strike"": refusing to marry or start families, knowing they can be criminalized if their wife files for divorce. ""Have anti-father family court policies led to a men's marriage strike?"" ask Glenn Sacks and Dianna Thompson in the Philadelphia Enquirer. In Britain, fathers tour university campuses warning young men not to start families. In his book, From Courtship to Courtroom, Attorney Jed Abraham concludes that the only protection for men to avoid losing their children and everything else is not to start families in the first place.

Is it wise to disseminate such advice? If people stop marrying, what will become of the family and our civilization?

Marriage is already all but dead, legally speaking, and divorce is the principal reason. The fall in the Western birth rate is directly connected with divorce law.

We will not restore marriage by burying our heads in the sand; nor simply by preaching to young people to marry.  The way to restore marriage as an institution in which young people can place their trust, their children, and their lives is to make it an enforceable contract. We urgently need a national debate about divorce, child custody, and the terms under which the government can forcibly sunder the bonds between parents and their children. We owe it to future generations, if there are to be any.

Taken Into Custody: The War Against Fathers, Marriage, and the Family: Stephen Baskerville:  ( view book on ""comments"" link)

Taken into Custody' exposes the greatest and most destructive civil rights abuse in America today. Family courts and Soviet-style bureaucracies trample basic civil liberties, entering homes uninvited and taking away people's children at will, then throwing the parents into jail without any form of due process, much less a trial. No parent, no child, no family in America is safe. The legal industry does not want you to hear this story. Radical feminists, bar associations, and social work bureaucracies have colluded to suppress this information. Even pro-family"" groups and civil libertarians look the other way. Yet it is a reality for tens of millions of Americans who are our neighbors.",1406592000,19,7916,4.87779433681073
