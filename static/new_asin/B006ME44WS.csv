5004691,5,B006ME44WS,"This is one powerful movie you may need tissues for as it tugs on the heart through-and-through. A Compelling and fascinating true story Of the life and death of Joyce Vincent, who passed away in 2003 in London. Her body was discovered 3 years later, with Christmas presents, and TV still on. Joyce was as Memorable and popular as the famous icon Stevie Wonder. How could it be possible, or even humane to find her body 3 years later, and when her death was announced, not even so much as a photograph? This heartfelt story has you thinking in silence, long after you watched the movie. It does leave a thought-provoking aftermath, and how could it not? A life of someone so important, yet no friends or family came forward to investigate her missing. The aftermath we feel is a sad one on humanity, and it makes us think of our own future and what will come about. Haunting, Chilling, Entertaining from start to finish. Highly Recommended!",1344038400,12,940,4.634730538922156

Dreams Of A Life...A film that is spreading worldwide by word of mouth & Twitter....

""Nobody noticed when Joyce Vincent died in her bedsit above a shopping mall in North London in 2003. Her body wasn't discovered for three years, surrounded by Christmas presents she had been wrapping, and with the TV still on. Newspaper reports offered few details of her life- not even a photograph.""

A seemingly detached life but after investigation revealed a popular and memorable woman who's story incredibly crosses paths with Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Cliff, Gil Scott-Heron & Nelson Mandela.

Saw it in the cinema [in Wood Green in the very building where this all happened!] and now have the dvd. So much more than it first seems. A story that will draw you in. And then won't let go.

Moving, stunning, haunting....one of the best docufilms ever made. The director Carol Morley has created an unforgettable piece of humanity and art.

As the tagline says: ""Dreams of a Life is sure to challenge the way you define friendship and will stay with you for a long time after viewing."" Fascinating true story that holds up a mirror to us all.

A film everyone, everywhere should see at least once. Just buy it, now. Watch it and feel the impact slowly alter your perceptions.

It will change you.....",1333411200,13,1310,4.765486725663717
5004693,4,B006ME44WS,"A beautiful, talented woman dies mysteriously in her flat in London, ""mysteriously"" because it takes three years for people to find her decomposed remains lying against the couch in front of the still-on TV, too badly degraded to find an actual cause of death.  What follows is how this could actually happen - how could someone in the middle of one of the largest cities in the world simply be forgotten?  Through interviews with former friends, lovers and colleagues and reenactments, the deceased is resurrected in memory as a vivacious, popular, ambitious woman who keeps her childhood demons to herself until they begin to pick her to pieces.  Some of those interviewed confirm that she was suffering a major downward spiral but, critically, they had dropped out of her life some time earlier.  And it is an odd sensation to listen to these people who were in her life and who claim to have thought her so dear when a little effort on their part could have saved her.  At the same time, it's hard for me to say whether I would have done anything as well.  Those interviewed did what we all do which is to keep up with life.  As for the deceased, it sounds as though her life had already ended on every level but the physical.  The film does not speculate on cause of death but it seems to veer in the direction of suicide although I would qualify it as accidental - once she realized what she had done, it was too late to get help.  Really, what a waste.",1494374400,3,1459,4.475471698113208
5004694,5,B006ME44WS,"The person/people who made this documentary did an excellent job tracking down Joyce's friends, co-workers and former boyfriends. They give some theories as to why this may have happened but there's just no way to know for sure. Obviously her sisters had nothing to say and isn't that telling? I wish the producers would have written something at the end about them even if it was just to say that they refused to speak on or off camera. Shame on them for forgetting her. I think many people these days lead lives with superficial acquaintances. Thanks to living our lives online it may seem we have hundreds of friends but it's not real.

5004707,5,B006ME44WS,"A very haunting documentary. Bravo to the filmmaker's decision to find out more about the person who died virtually unknown and under such unsettling circumstances. Only fragments of her life can be glimpsed from the interviews; and maybe the interviewees reveal themselves more than they paint a clear picture of Ms. Vincent. But as a result, you see how fleeting life is and how we may never really know the person next to us. It reminded me of ""Jacob's Room"" by Virginia Woolf.

5004726,1,B006ME44WS,"So badly done that it quickly extinguishes any interest in what is an actually very interesting, and sad, story.  Of course you start out wanting to know what happened to Joyce Vincent, who wouldn't?  But then.... this starts out with bunch of chopped up interviews with random people, with no indication as to who they are, or where or how they knew Joyce.  This approach often can work well, but unfortunately the editors of this mess were either utterly incompetent or, more likely, were just too carried away with creating all the silly, badly done re-enactments that are pasted in to fill this out to an hour plus - each one is worse that its predecessor.  Also thrown into the pile are shots of an incredibly disorganized investigation board, which is apparently supposed to provide context/background (if that board is actually the real work of the reporters who created this, that explains a lot).  All in all,a complete and total waste of time, although, if you make that far, the scene where the silly twit of a reporter ""reacts"" to hearing Joyce's voice will at least make you laugh (even while you cringe with embarrassment for him).

5004728,5,B006ME44WS,"This is a very interesting story. I became interested in this movie because Steven Wilson's album Hand Cannot Erase is based on this. I heard an interview with Steven Wilson where he talked about this young attractive woman who was missing for years and no one even noticed she was gone. She was found dead in her apartment several years later. Very interesting, sad, emotional and mysterious all at the same time. This moved Steven Wilson to base his album on her story.",1453075200,,471,4.686746987951807
5004729,4,B006ME44WS,"Very sad. I heard about Joyce Carol Vincent years before the movie came out. The film maker Carol Morley should be applauded. She took a newspaper clipping about Joyce that provided little details, no photo and no contact information to a documentary with people that knew her that could share a little light about Joyce (in which Joyce allowed them to see) to actual video footage of Joyce. That itself is amazing!

This film is really a conversation piece. Joyce Vincent had a difficult childhood in which she lost her mother at an early age. Her 4 sisters helped raise her and her Father was not really around. She didn't have a chance to develop emotionally. But she was beautiful. So I believe she learned to lean on her beauty. She also didn't have a sense of self. And we all feel this way at some point and use different coping mechanism to deal with it. She used relationships. I believe she was always looking for a Father figure (one of her ex boyfriends mentions this in the film). It explains why she reached back and try to recoup the relationships of her 20's in her 30's. It explains that by the time she died, she was living in a domestic violence shelter trying to escape an abusive relationship. I believe she would have benefited from some good counseling. But in the African American community, this topic is still be explored.

And I did a little research about why the rent and electricity were still being paid. She lived in a domestic shelter housing in which the rent and electricity were paid via electronic debit for a long period of time. When the money ran out, the London Housing Association went to repossess the bedsit. Her mail was fed through the open slot. She lived in public housing so the garbage was pretty bad. The smell of her body would have confused with the garbage. And her apartment was isolated. She also moved around allot. She could have been scared of staying in one place at one time. And please remember, cell phones, Facebook and all of the social media tools were just being started when she died in 2003. She was found in 2006.

All in all, the main message that this film is trying to say...is check on your family members, friends and neighbors. You never know the story behind the ""smile."" Joyce Carol Vincent was very beautiful but beauty is only skin deep. She only let people see what they wanted to see. Some of her boyfriend got a chance to know her a little bit but her story is cautionary tale. Reach out to someone and tell your story.",1452988800,5,2502,4.518763796909492
5004730,1,B006ME44WS,"Joyce Carol Vincent story needed to be told, but unfortunately the Carol Morley(the director) fell very short.

5004747,4,B006ME44WS,"this was a disturbing documentary.  the interview portions neatly sum up what little is known about the interior life of a woman that everybody seemed to like (with one obvious exception--see if you too spot the difference!) and yet no one really knew.  the recreation portions were a bit heavily used, and I generally dislike them anyway because we come to view the actress AS the person, and the recreations as somehow signifying their true personality when the problem was, I doubt anyone knew what the real personality of this woman was like.  she was a beautiful object, and seemed pleasant and approachable but no one with the exception of her boyfriends wanted to know much more.  Wikipedia claims that her family actually had hired investigators to track her down when they lost sight of her, but other than saying ""the family wishes to remain anonymous"" and conjecture about possible rifts (since none of her 'friends' or boyfriends had ever even met them), this film leaves that side mostly in the dark.

this woman was unloved, uncared about, and may have had emotional or personality problems that prevented her from getting close enough to another human being well enough for them to see it and help her.  one boyfriend, who is the only one that says cruel and uncaring things about her throughout the documentary which conflicts strongly with the person that all of the other interviewees are describing, claims to have cared about her deeply and yet shows very little emotion that isn't neutral or negative when speaking about her.  this is telling, to me.  either he got closer to her than the others and saw behind the mask that she portrayed (the mask of ""nothing is wrong.  my life is just fine.  I'm a bubbly, upbeat girl living a great life.""), or there was some personal issue between them which left him with the negative charge so clearly shown when he speaks about her.

I tend to think that it is a mixture of both, because he also says some of the most illuminating things about her:  that she was 'emotionally retarded' and had 'come from nowhere, and was obviously going nowhere'.  both are probably true, and linked.  if you know absolutely that no one really cares about you, you drift through life with no goals and nowhere to be.  why do any particular thing?  no one except you will care about it.  for some people, this is enough but for someone who is emotionally stunted at a young age and cut off from the primary caregivers in various ways, there is a very big lack of motivating force and almost no self-regard.  this woman kept up the appearance because it was the only thing she felt she had going for her.  she didn't think that she had much else to offer, and no one ever invested the time when she was young to help her see whatever strengths she may have had and develop them in order to live a productive life.  so, it didn't matter how intellectually capable she was.  the feeling underlying her life was ""no one cares because there is nothing about me to cause anyone to care"", and that comes directly from the family and then is reinforced by the personality formed this way, and the actions that personality tends to take.  this is not to disclaim all responsibility for one's own life, but hopefully enlighten people that there is a very large deficit with someone like this that impacts everything that they feel, think & do, or fail to do and which actively prevents them from changing the situation.

as someone whose family would not know or care about them if they rotted away to nothing, and who hasn't had a close friend in years, I can tell you that this kind of background leaves an emotional hole so wide (stemming as it does, from childhood) that almost nothing and no one can fill it.  it suggests to me that there was such an emotional disconnect in that family, that I'm not surprised that none of them wanted to represent themselves in this re-envisionment.  they would be facing the assumptions (which I'm freely making also) that they were ultimately responsible for how she ended up.  as someone who does not get close to nor trust many other people, who has 'none of their own friends', who adopts a chameleon personality and molds themselves to their significant other in such a way that it appears seamless, it suggests to me that the family never allowed her to express who she truly was.  they had an image of her, which may have come from the early childhood fixation on elocution & deportment training and her own physical appearance, that she would be a little china doll and go on and do great things (or marry great things), and in order for her to fit into that family and avoid negative reactions & conflict, she had to follow along and play that part for them, and let their power over everything go unchallenged.  this pattern was then repeated with each and every boyfriend (notice how they fixate on her appearance).  they didn't address what the child was truly feeling, help her set goals for her life or teach her how to work towards them.  they just assumed that she'd 'figure it out' when she got to live her own life without actually teaching her HOW TO LIVE.  and, from the way this woman walked out of any conflict in her life rather than confront it, it suggests a heavy atmosphere of Learned Helplessness--which is also instilled in childhood when you realize that NOTHING you do will have any impact on the outcome of the situation.  In other words, power was  oriented in such a way in the household that it did not matter what this girl felt or did, because none of those things would have an impact nor change the situation for the better.  the others would do whatever they were going to do, and she just had to live with the consequences of it.  if she could not bear the consequences, she ran.  that is how you 'cope with' negative interactions with people at work, boyfriends etc. as well.  the sad thing is, it works.  it alleviates the problem in the short term.  the tragic thing is that one never learns to deal with conflict or to resolve it. that suggests also that the family had conflicts that were just endured, or continued on and on and were never resolved.

as I say, I'm making heavy armchair psychoanalysis from a documentary that leaves you with only a rough sketch of a person and is probably an inaccurate one at best.  this would probably be false and hubristic of me after many hours speaking to the actual person, which means I'm really speaking to the image portrayed of this woman that resonated so strongly with my own life and background.  this kind of background makes you not want to trust, and actually fear being consumed and dominated by others, and hesitant to enter arrangements where another has power over you, because your past experience tells you that this power WILL be abused.  paradoxically, it also makes you really want to seek out a very involved relationship so that you have validation that, yes...you are cared about and someone DOES want to be around you and know you, and most importantly that at least one person in the world really does love you.  hence the comments that men were a bit too possessive with her from her friends, the abusive boyfriend(s) that they never managed to track down, etc.  so, you are stuck playing out a drama that eternally has a bad ending because you seek out traits in another person that will cause them to abuse your trust, and all of your energy will have been invested in that relationship leaving little else when it falls apart.

if this woman was really my doppelganger, she may have seemed like a nice, friendly person who had it all going for her, but she didn't feel that way inside.  she felt unloved and unloveable, with nothing to offer the world and no real reason to work on finding something either (who would care?  probably, there isn't anything in there worthwhile anyway.  or, ""I'm not good at anything, really.  just existing""), and probably totally helpless to change anything about her life for the better because everything in one's atmosphere and experience suggests that it is really one's entire self that has to change in order to be loved & accepted.  you feel deeply flawed, and don't know how to address it that doesn't involve the death of the person you are and a large effort to become someone else.  you can 'act like' what others expect and seem to want, but you do not know how to BE nor are you happy just 'being'.  this woman was surrounded by Christmas presents for people who did not care enough or know her well enough to call her up on the phone, or show up at the door.  this is symbolic of this kind of person:  I want to be liked, and show my care for others but no one seems to show their care for me, leading directly to the conclusion that no one does care for me because....all of the above.  it isn't even that the person is particularly unlikeable, or has negative traits that others will dislike.  they simply know that there isn't anything there inside that others will gravitate towards or care about.  and in this busy world, where there is never enough time in the day for the things that people really DO care about in their lives, they are right.  no one is going to take the time to invest that care, because no one is 'your parent'.  it was their job, and it somehow got neglected.  try figuring that one out without therapy.",1397260800,8,9370,4.571514063435068

5004761,3,B006ME44WS,"I watched Dreams of a Life night before last and Joyce Vincent is still on my mind. It's chilling that someone can lay in an apartment dead for three years in a busseling(sp) city and no one notice. Joyce's life is/was an even bigger mystery than her death. It seems that most people she had relationships with never really knew her at all. She only let people get so close before she just faded away. The sad part is that none of these people took it upon themselves to find out what was really going on with her, they just assumed that she was off living some fabulous life when she was in reality slowly closing herself off from the world. Even the boyfriend who claimed Joyce was the ""love of his life"" let her just slip away.

The documentary itself had the potential to be great, but with the combination of the few people(family, landlord, police) who could have offered substantive information and the serious lack of a paper trail (pictures, video, etc) it was hard to pull together a complete picture of this woman's life. The talking heads interviews were intertwined with reenactments of the ""friends"" accounts of evens in Joyce's life, although the actress did a great job, the singing of two complete songs during a documentary was a little much.

I wish she could have gotten the sisters, the ""polish boyfriend"", more school mates, someone that can help peace together this womans life, would have made this much more full.

For those who asked about how the landlord didn't come looking for his rent for three years; if seems that Joyce checked into a shelter for domestic violence victims, as apart of that program, they found housing for her and paid her rent(maybe electricity too) for her. It seems as some point, the trust that the money was drawn from went dry, so her rent went unpaid and that is why there was finally a notice of eviction. As an aside, I'm really curious as to what type of TV she had that could run three years straight without burning out?

Also Joyce's mail was delivered through a slot in her door, so there was no outside mailbox, which would of course have alerted people earlier that something was amiss. It also looks as if Joyce, alienated herself from her family for some reason, she also moved very frequently, so that is another reason it may have been hard for them to keep track of. All in all it seems as if a series of unfortunate events that cause this. It is definitely and eyeopening documentary that is making me examine my own life and relationships.",1391731200,2,2512,4.575555555555556

5004770,2,B006ME44WS,I did not make it thorough the whole film.  I found it was becoming repetitive.  The filmmakers use accounts of her life from acquaintances to paint a picture of a life lived without lasting connections.  But it beats that point over your head (as well as how pretty she was) but doesn't address he burning question of who was in her life at the time of her death - what did her multiple sisters think? Did she have an employer? What did her landlord who tried to evict her do beside make a few knocks on the door?

5004771,4,B006ME44WS,"I gave this movie four stars, because it says a lot in 95 minutes. Others are reviewing the movie and complaining that their wasn't enough personal information about her well that was the point of the movie! Joyce Vincent has been the topic of more conversations after her death than she did in real life. She never had real friends the ones that could answer questions about who she was. Once they gathered everyone that knew her NONE of the people could explain the full story about many of her major life events. She had two solid romantic relationships where she was all consumed in their lives. She was around their friends, took on their hobbies and never in her life did she express any real interest in anything of her own. She wasn't a real person just a beautiful woman that was desired for being kind, soft, and attractive. She wasn't your average opinionated, passionate, or driven person. There was absolutely nothing about her that made people connect with her in such a way that would encourage close relationships. Even the men that loved her loved that she loved them and became a part of their lives without changing it since, she had no real passions of her own to add to their lives.

The topic of debate was how can something like this happen to someone so young (38 year old)? Well, it happens, because she never let anyone in. She didn't have a ""sense of self"" to offer to the world everything was private. She also had a series of random friendships with people that could careless if they ever saw her again instead of building solid relationships with those who would miss her if she wasn't around. She had no interests, hobbies, or deep conversations it was almost like she was meant to die in this way to shed light on the real value of relationships. She died on her carpet while wrapping Christmas gifts for people that she never saw again yet, NONE of them missed her enough to report her missing that alone is enough for people to think about the people that they have in their lives. If you don't answer your phone who comes over? If you haven't reached out who is worried about you?

This movie is a great conversation piece, because her lonely death and undiscovered corpse was a result of a lifetime of empty choices. Yes, the movie lacks a personal touch, but she didn't have one to offer so clearly they shouldn't have added one. They had a few photos discovered from her home and a video of her at Mandela's speech, but she didn't take many pictures and didn't have many friends with photos to offer. What was said about her by former co workers, former lovers, and etc was more informative than seeing countless outdated pictures. So, for those who fear this could happen to them they can compare their life choices and relationships to hers and see....are you really doing that bad?",1390780800,13,2823,4.566074950690335
5004772,1,B006ME44WS,"I am truly baffled by the four and five star reviews.  This ""documentary"" left me with more questions than I had prior to viewing. This was nothing more than a series of interviews given by long lost acquaintances (and two former boyfriends) who never really even knew her.  Most of those interviewed were not even her friends, but those of the dreadful guilt-ridden boyfriend who didn't want to have ""tinted"" babies with her.  I am actually very disturbed by him, and I feel he knows more than what he offered. The other boyfriend seems to have a ""woman scorned"" attitude.  He seems to still be bitter about being set aside.  Besides the boyfriends, there was no one interviewed who could offer any real information about who she was.  Where are her sisters?  Where is the landlord?  I'm quite suspicious of him, as well - - no rent for three years and no eviction? In what world?

There was also a great deal of time wasted with the lip synched songs that may or may not describe what she was feeling.  This piece was based on a number of assumptions made by the filmmaker.  This was a missed opportunity to remove the shroud of mystery at least from the woman's life since there will always be a question about her death.

-Were there any names on the Christmas gifts? Who where they for?
-Did anyone actually contact the bank manager?
-Where was she when she claimed her dad died?
-Who was paying the bills?  There has to be a paper trail.
-Did anyone speak to a representative from the shelter she was in?

5004776,2,B006ME44WS,"To me this ""documentary"" left some obvious gaps; it dealt more with Joyce's life and personality as friends and co-workers remember her by doing on-camera interviews and fading through reenactments of the stories they recall. But what wasn't even addressed, and what I kept hoping would be, was the fact that she apparently lay in the apartment for three years without the threat of having her power shut off or her rent paid. Seriously. There's NO WAY these days that anyone could go three MONTHS without it becoming an issue. Perhaps someone had been covering those costs for her? If so, it would have been interesting to include their insights to the story.

These questions are the premise of this film of Joyce Vincent's life and unbelievable circumstances of death.  Other reviewers have given good plot synopsis and in the interest of not being redundant, I encourage you to check our their thoughts.

The ending.

5004778,5,B006ME44WS,"The story is sad, and mysterious-- how can a young, normal young woman just fall off the map? The filmmakers try to answer that question. At the outset, you think she must have been a drug addict, depressed.. etc.. but none of that appears to be true. She had family, friends, jobs.. and was apparently quit attractive and likeable. Toward the end of the interviews, you can piece together a hypothesis of what might have gone on with her towards the end of her life.
I thought it was profoundly sad that they man who describes her as ""the love of his life"" didn't want to marry her because he didn't want to have ""tinted"" (mixed race) children.

The filmmakers do a good job of finding and interviewing people, and the actress they cast to represent Joyce both looked like her and acted the part well.
The story is sad, makes you realize that with some bad luck and a couple bad choices, many of us could end up in her situation.

Using the actress throughout to lip synch songs, some that dragged on excruciatingly long, I think did an addition disservice to a forgotten soul, validating that indeed, she never mattered. It's impossible to believe that of all these people, they didn't have any pictures or films to make her more real, besides the big reveal at the Mandela appearance. They claimed to socialize with her, that she wanted to be a performer, and her ex boyfriend was even a promotor. He did't have an visuals of her?  Something.  Obviously the filmmaker opted not to delve more deeply into why she was so isolated and really hammer hard on the point that this person was an elusive enigma. But maybe not. We'll never know because this wasn't a story about her, but a statement about society.  It's not that difficult to piece together the disintegration of a family and a life.. Neighbors, other relatives, landlords, other people that exist that could bear witness. This film was disturbing.

5004783,5,B006ME44WS,"Clearly Joyce Carol Vincent had demons she was dealing with alone.  Her public persona was not the same as her private one.  I think being beautiful drew men to her but she didn't know how to take that relationship and grow it.  Nor, in fact, how to grow friendships with men and women.  She may have been afraid of another loss after losing her mother at an early age and having her father grow distant (or so it seems) after her mother died.  I agree with the comment of a friend in the movie in that she seems to not have matured completely emotionally.  She stepped in and out of lives, craving relationships but unable to grow and nurture them.  She knew she was pretty.  She could see that.  But, she didn't trust that she was also a good person, had a good voice, was a good employee, and that people wanted to be her friend.  As another of her friends said: She couldn't let go and just live it....enjoy the sun without worrying about the clouds sure to come.  It's a sad story and it makes me consider certain aspects of my own life and make sure I'm living my life as fully as I really wish.  Quite haunting.  I felt badly, too, for her friend Martin.

5004787,5,B006ME44WS,"This was riveting, albeit painful. Since I was born the same year and I too live in a 'bedsit', it was unnerving and hits upon some of our darkest fears of dying alone.

I don't want to spoil too much of the mystery, but will say that she really wasn't the stereotypical 'crazy cat lady' type you'd expect. I took it as not just a parable of urban disconnection but also how she seemed (like many of us from the 80s) like a great example of the 'dress for success' myth- the 'fake it till you make it' idea of the yuppie 80s which was instilled in many people, especially women, that if you put up a good front, you can go anywhere. It reminds me of how we were instructed more in how to dress for work than what to really know, what skills to have. Everyone in this doc says that her exterior persona was striking but that there was a mystery behind it, and some say she was lost. It also sounds like she, having been well-raised but working-class and nearly abandoned, was less equipped to deal with reality than she let on. I get the feeling, from the way she often up and left jobs and housing, that whenever the demands of reality outweighed what she could charm her way through that she ran away. This is not a judgement, but a sad comment on the difficulty of trying to rise above your station with little means of support and feeling like you must conceal who you are and where you come from. I can relate, and I think many people can.

The impression the film gives is that she was actually a fragile dreamer, an escapist from a painful background, capable of putting up an excellent exterior partly as a survival mechanism. I think they portray this very well- the actress is excellent and is able to pull off some pretty challenging scenes.

It reminded me a little of the true-story comedy ""I love you Phillip Morris"", in which the con-man talks his way into a high finance job, only to be discovered by an auditor as doodling all over the finance reports while hundreds of thousands were being embezzled. While JV doesn't seem to have engaged in anything criminal, it seemed similar in that she may've been someone in way over her head who just fled and retreated when things began to unravel.

The best insights seem to come from her ex, Alistair the musician. He's got a good grasp on her problems with a sober, less sentimental take, yet is also compassionate. Many others in the film come off as having been dazzled by her exterior, and not really knowing her- though everyone seems to agree that was Joyce's intention. She clearly kept everyone at a distance on purpose- to hide her upbringing and because she feared losing people, and because she had deep insecurities despite a confidant exterior. Alistair talks of JV's fears of intimacy and happiness, and of losing both, and that makes the most sense.

On the film treatment, I thought the re-enactments were actually really effective and moving; only twice did I feel they went over the top and lingered too long on the effect they were trying to acheive. It was really the only way you could try to connect with someone so mysterious; I think it was a good call on the part of the writer/director.

On the issue of her death, as someone else stated, the landlord's role in all of it is very suspicious. While reports say her door was bolted from the inside, that doesn't rule out someone leaving thru the window. Also not enough is discussed about how her bills were paid- apparently the documentarian got a lot of resistance when inquiring about her utilities & rent. Though JV lived in public housing, and possibly had rent automatically paid by some kind of public assistance, what about utilities (the TV still being on 3 years later). I've worked in public housing in the US, and while laws may differ, non-payment can get you evicted in 90 days, and someone who had been cleaning houses and couch-surfing could not have a large savings to draw funds from electronically. It's possible either the landlord did it, or a boyfriend who then threatened the landlord. I can buy the idea of being disconnected from family and friends (troubled people often become estranged) but the bills going on for 3 years? Not buying that. I would like to know how far the police traced the money- what payment accounts were set up, when they were set up and by whom- all of it is way too fishy. It's very possible that she died of asthma, that she was estranged, but the financial angle is very hard to believe.

This movie really stays with you after watching-it's very haunting. The last image of the real Joyce is telling- while she's happy- at a historic event with Nelson Mandela, she looks excited yet with a deep inner sadness and confusion that you can see in her eyes. Perhaps it's all a matter of suggestion from the narrative, but she really looks vaguely panicked. This combination of exterior flash with internal fragility and fear, along with a certain childlike quality, reminded me of what everyone said about Marilyn Monroe.

A fascinating and sad film.

Post-script: after reading a discussion on this film, one commenter seemed to have solved the riddle. If she was a victim of abuse and stalking (which it sounds like she was) she most likely was hiding and very afraid of being tracked down. Abusers often contact shelters and friends to find their exes. So she was probably scared witless. She probably *intentionally* made it so that no one could find her. That makes complete sense to me-- also it explains why she would just up and leave jobs. If her stalker exes showed up at work, she'd have to make a hasty exit, if she feared violence. Victims of stalking often take drastic measures out of security reasons. Also, apparently 'council housing' (public housing in England) often has autmated payment of bills through government assistance programs, so that explains the paid bills for years. Poor woman just had to hide from scary, threatening men who abused and terrorized her. Thus she had to become isolated and alone just to survive. Very sad.",1378166400,5,6038,4.604089219330855
5004788,3,B006ME44WS,"After watching the movie and doing more research about Joyce online, I've discovered something that not many people have. She had so many symptoms of a personality disorder. I can't believe more people hadn't seen this. The chameleon personality, the several job changes, dropping out of friend's lives for periods of time, no long-term serious romantic relationships and many more. Her childhood probably contributed to a personality disorder as well being that her mother died when she was young and her father wasn't able to provide the emotional stability she needed at such a traumatic time in her young life. A personality disorder would of also made her more vulnerable to fall victim to an abusive relationship. I'm sure her sisters could of given more information about her childhood and family relationships that would of explained a lot about Joyce's behaviors as an adult. I'm sure there are things from the past that they don't want getting out to the public. I urge you to research personality disorders.

5004800,4,B006ME44WS,"The late Rodney Dangerfield said, ""The only normal people are the ones you don't know too well.""

The 2011 documentary DREAMS OF A LIFE asks how a woman named Joyce Vincent, alone in her North London, England, apartment could be dead for three years before being discovered - with her television set playing, no less?  Friends of this woman are interviewed and of course wish they had not let the relationship with her lapse to such a point.

There are others to whom you'd want to talk who do not appear in the film.  You might ask:

- of Joyce Vincent's landlord, how does a tenant not pay rent for more than three years and you don't act?

- of the woman's electricity provider, if Vincent's television was playing all that time, why hadn't you followed up on her unpaid bill?

- of her relatives, was there no common acquaintance who could tell you where to find Joyce?

- of her postal service, didn't Vincent have uncollected mail?

- of her neighbors, did you not hear the television audio nonstop for three years; were there no uncollected packages at her door; did you not smell her body decomposing?

For me, those questions are the answer to DREAMS OF A LIFE.  In this so-called age of communication, if anything people know less about one another than ever and are afraid to get any closer than a text message, e-mail, or social media web site allows.  Personally, in my 52 years I've never lived anyplace where I might recognize more than a handful of my neighbors should we cross paths at the grocery store.  I have yet to know a neighborhood where many people interact.  In the seven addresses I've had in my adult life, I've received exactly one knock on the door from anyone welcoming me to the neighborhood.  I gave up trying myself after having the couple that moved next door three addresses ago over for dinner only to have them never invite us to their place.

Those who knew Joyce Vincent did not know her well, certainly not well enough.  But that's normal, isn't it?

5004801,4,B006ME44WS,"Joyce Vincent, 38 years old, dies in her London flat at Christmastime 2003, surrounded by partly wrapped presents with the television on. Her body lies there decomposing for three years, until her landlord orders the flat broken into due to the fact he is owed 2800 in back rent, and no one will come to the door.  They find her skeleton lying there, surrounded by those Christmas presents, the television still on.

A modern dystopian nightmare, like a Dickens tale revised by Kafka then Camus. As one of the men who found her put it, she had simply melted away, into the floor.

Who was this woman, how did this happen?

She was not a drug addict or alcoholic. Her cause of death is unclear, but was likely a major asthma attack. The larger mystery: how is it she had lain there undiscovered so long?

It turns out that she had been a successful office worker, who had had many friends; a beautiful woman who had been involved in several longterm romantic relationships. The filmmakers delve into her past, find many of the people who knew her, and interview them. She was well liked, men found her very attractive, and she had been very social.. But at the same time, she remained in many ways a cypher. No one knew her family, she spoke of having lost her beloved mother as a child, of being alienated from her father, and then never spoke of the three older sisters who had raised her after her mothers death.  She has relationships with several men, but they never come to fruition in a family. There is an unnamed ""Polish man"" whom she dated in the years leading up to her death who may've abused her. In the end she broke off her relationships, quit jobs when things got difficult and just faded away, and nobody was involved enough to follow up on her, no cared enough to pay attention..

Until the her landlord broke her door down and found her lying there, alone, her bones buried under the dust of three years' neglect and abandonment.

The film does not explain how the electricity had remained on all that time without payment, nor how the landlord took so long to come looking for his rent.  That seems the biggest mystery here. The attenuated work and romantic relationships and neighbors who could hear the television and smelled something odd coming from the apartment but never did anything seem all too believable. That she had some sort of trauma in her history, both in her family, and with certain men she had dated - none of whom the filmmakers could find or convince to go on camera - also all seem all too credible.

It is the details of her life, and the sketch they make of her that makes this film interesting.  There are gaps and question marks, mysteries that are not revealed, leaving the portrait somehow incomplete, but the overall effect is elegiac.  She, like a flickering flame extinguished in the wind..

Sad, tragic and strange, but still somehow beautiful. Worth seeing, I say.",1365206400,4,2917,4.586538461538462
5004802,4,B006ME44WS,"Typically, I don't like re-enactments. However, for this film there's simply no other way to tell the story. The end of the story is shocking and heart-wrenching, but it seems that her life was like most young people. She had entry-level jobs, sought out a new group of friends in the city, and tried to pursue her dream of becoming a singer. She also had some bumps along the road both personally and financially. But, instead of finding her own way, she's found dead so long after her demise that the coroner cannot even determine the cause of death.

The questions that remain are what haunted me the most.

How did the electricity stay on for three years? Why did she only owe a few months of back rent instead of years' worth? Was she in contact with any of her four sisters in the days leading up to her death? Had she so disconnected herself from her family that none of them filed a missing person report on her, despite the three year gap in contact?

Dreams of a Life doesn't answer these questions. At the end, we're still left with a mystery.",1363737600,,1054,4.422680412371134
5004803,5,B006ME44WS,"Now that I have Netflix, I am indulging myself in my passion for documentaries, something I usually have done for many years at the Indie movie houses. I have wafted and trudged through many as of late, which, till now, ranged from mind numbingly boring to pleasantly entertaining to very good. I just watched ""Dreams Of A Life"", and I'm still trying to breathe. Brilliant, tragic, touching, haunting, disturbing, are the first words that come to mind when trying to sum up this film. Since there are several excellent reviews with which I agree already posted here, as well as an accurate description of the subject matter of this film, I will not attempt to describe what it is about. I will only say that, as a person who had a very troubled, unloved childhood and youth, who had spent years isolating myself from people, that this film left me in jaw dropping sadness, and a certain sense of relief. That is not to say that it is simply a ""depressing"" movie. It is , as someone else pointed out here...a life lesson, and a warning perhaps about how easily someone can allow themselves, and be allowed, to slip through the cracks. Life and personal relationships are hard, but life is not a spectator sport, as seductive as isolation can be to certain people like myself. I will say that in time, I have learned what for me is a healthy balance of social interaction and alone time, of taking the initiative to reach out to others and be receptive to them in kind. I never knew Joyce, the subject of this film, and I don't know that I am 100% satisfied in answering what happened to this lovely girl. I only know that I was completely unprepared for the devastating power of this brilliant film. Also of note, I abhor the dreaded ""recreation"" scenes in most films, which almost never work. Here, they are 100% effective in conveying the feeling of isolation this young woman who seemingly had ""everything"" experienced, while never being maudlin. Interspersed here are interviews with the real life people that were in Joyce's life, all of whom express shock, incomprehension, or remorse at how this girl they thought they knew wound up a corpse left undiscovered for 3 years in her small apartment in the center of one of the worlds most vibrant cities. The finale, a clip of the real life Joyce, slowly turning her head and looking at the camera, accompanied by the haunting ""Tell Me""...literally left me immobilized for several minutes. A very sad but powerfully important film, exceedingly well done.  Perhaps the only question left unanswered: Why Joyce?  Why?????",1359763200,21,2571,4.736607142857143
