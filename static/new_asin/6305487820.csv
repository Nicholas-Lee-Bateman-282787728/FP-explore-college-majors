What impressed me even more, was the fast shipping done by Buy Co. (The Buying Company), the third party seller I purchased this through. I'm an Amazon Unbox member, so I'm used to that quick delivery. I didn't expect the same through Buy Co., but they were extremely fast. I made the purchase in the evening of 11/29/11 and I received the DVD in the mail before 9 AM on 12/02/11! It's too early for me to even give Buy Co. a review yet, so I put it with my thoughts on the DVD. Thank you for the fast shipping and the good program!",1322870400,,688,4.180451127819549
