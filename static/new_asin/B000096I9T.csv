1880011,1,B000096I9T,"I found Circus of Fear to be a thoroughly bad movie in so, so many ways.  Even the most enthusiastic fan of Christopher Lee should think twice about seeing his uninspired performance here.  Sadly, almost all of the other actors come off worse than he does.  It is very important to note that, while this film is capable of invoking horror on the part of the unfortunate viewer, it is in no way a horror film and is in no way associated with Hammer Studios.  I should admit that my own intense dislike for the circus may make me a little biased, but I don't think even Ziegfried and Roy could enjoy this story.  We start with a rather complicated robbery of an armored truck, and then follow one of the robbers to a rendezvous on the confines of the Barberini Circus.  Several deaths ensue, two or three rather outlandish storylines converge, unhealthy-looking animals are exploited in ways only a circus can be responsible for, we are forced to endure circus people at their most crude and painfully annoying worst, and we are rewarded in the end with a final plot twist that seems manufactured out of thin air.  As if all of this isn't bad enough, the print of this 1966 film is flat-out terrible.  During the first ten minutes, there is seemingly no end of quite serious jumps in the film.  The picture quality is so dark and obscured that night scenes are almost impossible to make out and even the lightest of scenes appears afflicted with some kind of dark affliction bleeding the colors as dry and weak as the plot itself.  Even if Circus of Fear were to be restored to a presentable audio-visual state, it would hardly be worth watching.",1052611200,5,1644,4.5423728813559325
7989874,5,B000096I9T,"Good mid-60's British-made Edgar Wallace mystery.  (Not a horror film).  After a successfully executed (with a killing) armored-van bank heist the thieves get caught, except for the inside man, who gets offed at a wintering circus.  But where does the money end up.  Then we are treated to the soap-opera goings-on of the circus performers, some mysterious, some suspicious, and some just plain annoying.  Has some good British and West German actors.  Christopher Lee as the hooded lion-tamer, Suzy Kendall as his niece / assistant, Heinz Drache as the ring-master, beautiful Margaret Lee as the knife-thrower's assistant, Klaus Kinski as a creepy loiterer, and so-forth.  The Blue Underground DVD is excellent, with a crystal-clear picture quality, beautiful color, and at 91 minutes probably the fullest length the film is.  I always liked this film.  Highly recommended.",1478995200,,874,5.367647058823529

7989876,3,B000096I9T,"During the 1960s there was an entire subgenre of films, most of them German, based on the works of prolific English author Edgar Wallace (1877-1933) who is best known in America for having written the original draft script of KING KONG. He was immensely popular during his lifetime but his reputation rapidly declined after his death. Why he should suddenly become popular again 30 years later, and in Germany of all places, is anybody's guess. Over the course of 13 years (1959-1972) there were 32 German films based on Wallace's books known as ""krimis"" or crime stories but a few were made elsewhere including 3 in England by producer Harry Alan Towers of which CIRCUS OF FEAR (1966) was the last. Thanks to it's retitling as PSYCHO-CIRCUS with most of the caper elements removed and Christopher Lee's name on the marquee, the movie was marketed as a horror movie which it definitely is not. People who rent or buy the film with that in mind are justifiably annoyed when they find that out but CIRCUS is actually a decent crime/mystery film when seen here in it's original uncut version (91 min -vs- 67 min) and in color.

The film opens with a well executed robbery on Tower Bridge where half-a-million pounds are stolen. Unfortunately one of the payroll guards is killed and the thieves are forced to split up. An anonymous tip leads to the capture of most of the gang. The one with the money is killed near a circus. When a member of the troop (Lee) accidentally finds the money, he hides it. Cut to the circus where we meet squabbling performers, see a few circus acts, and witness a couple of knife murders. Is it the knife thrower? the lion tamer?, or perhaps a blackmailing dwarf? It's up to the ringmaster (Heinz Drache) and a Scotland Yard inspector (Leo Genn) to find out. Perrenial nutcase Klaus Kinski is there, along with Drache, for the German audience where this film was well received. It's much closer in spirit and style to Joan Crawford's BERSERK (1967) than to CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960). However if you're a fan of crime fiction, enjoy caper films, and aren't overly picky, then CIRCUS OF FEAR is an engaging enough way to kill an hour and a half. Just don't expect great filmmaking even if it was made by the man who gave us HORROR HOTEL.",1388361600,,2260,4.621890547263682
7989877,2,B000096I9T,"Not overly concerned with the pedigree here . Entirely too much attention paid to that and those . What starts out swell , about 20 minutes or slightly more , of a fine caper film that shows folks who did not grow up in England lots of cool images and locations and a terrific theft , devolves . Devolves into ""private meetings"" galore (much to the chagrin of the viewer) . With Christopher Lee delivering almost an entire performance under a sock (ski mask) and with completely aimless and shambling screenwriting fully underway , it's a film finished by (1) a completist (2) a masochist (3) an idiot .

7989878,3,B000096I9T,"Released in 1966, Circus of Fear (also known as Circus of Terror and Psycho-Circus) has a misleading title: it implies a horror film. But this is really half-heist, half-detective thriller set against a circus background.  An unknown mastermind plans the perfect robbery, but one of his henchmen gets trigger happy and thereby places the entire gang in jeopardy.  Unexpected circumstances send at least a portion of the loot to Barbarini's Circus--where, it seems, more than one person is aware of its presence.  When a body turns up at the circus, Inspector Elliot (Leo Genn) begins an investigation and meets, among others, circus owner Barbarini (Anthony Newlands) and circus star The Great Gregor (Christopher Lee.)  It isn't long before more murders occur.  Is there more than one killer?  Is every one at the circus who they seem to be?

Circus of Fear is well acted--it even features a young Klaus Kinski in an early role--but the story is somewhat predictable and the scripting is full of holes and the cuting is quite bizarre.  And it's certainly no big budget affair.  Even so, Circus of Fear is mildly entertaining, the sort of movie that is fun to watch once.  Unfortunately, the film seems to be in the public domain, which means there are a lot of questionable prints out there.  The best of the lot--the one you want to look for--has both trailers and an audio commentary, all of them mildly enjoyable.  Avoid the rest.

The plot to Web of Spider sounds a little hokey; a writer/journalist journeys to London to meet and interview Edgar Allan Poe, and he ends up spending a night in a haunted castle.  I understand that this 1972 film is a remake of the black and white classic Castle of Blood, but having not yet seen the first film I can not compare the two.  All I can say is that this is an extraordinarily, genuinely creepy movie.  The inclusion of Edgar Allan Poe (played somewhat questionably by Klaus Kinski) is really quite unnecessary as the adventures at the castle more than stand on their own two feet.  For his part, however, Poe claims that all of his stories are based on true events, and he has a new story in waiting when the American journalist Alan Foster (Tony Franciosa) accepts Lord Blackwood's bet that he cannot spend a full night in his haunted castle.  I won't say much about what happens over the course of this strange night, except to say that it is far from just your typical haunted house story.  The first ten or fifteen minutes of Alan's exploration of the house were really and truly creepy, on a level that had me engaging in my own dialogue with Foster.  I remember saying ""don't go in there"" and ""nothing good will come of this"" several times.  Years of sating my compulsion for horror in all its forms has all but atrophied my ""spooks"" nerve, but this movie dug way down and hit that nerve several times, much to my uncomfortable delight.  I even sort of jumped once, and that is unheard of.

I don't feel the movie was very predictable, either, and that is another reason I enjoyed it so much.  I'm not saying it's difficult to see the ultimate conclusion coming, but I for one was never completely sure how things would play out until the very end.  The Gothic look and feel to the movie is outstanding, really, and the cast (aside from Kinski) is superb.  Michele Mercier is particularly captivating in her role.  I would praise the other cast members one by one, for the effectiveness of this movie is a direct byproduct of their outstanding work, but I really do not want to risk giving away one single thing about the night's events.  If you enjoy old school horror, especially of a richly Gothic variety, Web of the Spider is just what the doctor ordered.  I hesitate to make a claim as bold as this, but, at least for the time being, this is the best, most deliciously creepy haunted house movie I have ever seen.",1127520000,,3552,4.498442367601246

7989881,3,B000096I9T,"Circus of Fear (1966), aka Circus of Terror (1966), aka Psycho Circus (1967), as it was known in the United States, is based on a novel by prolific writer Edgar Wallace, who, among other works, also wrote the novel that became the basis for the film King Kong (1933).  Circus of Fear, directed by John Moxley, probably most remembered for his work on television, The Avengers, The Saint, Mission Impossible, Mannix, Hawaii Five-O, The Night Stalker, any much more, was also responsible for the film Horror Hotel (1960).

The film takes place in England, and starts out with the robbery of an armored car.  Things are going smoothly, until one of the guards sees an opportunity to escape, and gets shot by the other guard.  Ahhh...an inside job.  Anyway, the men make a unique escape, and meet up later in a hidden location.  A call to the anonymous mastermind of the heist, who none of the actual robbers have ever met, provides specific instructions with regards to the inside man and the rest of the gang.  The inside man is told to take the money to a remote location, and the others leave, with the idea that they will get their shares later, but soon get caught by the police through an anonymous tip, as the inside man reaches the rendezvous, near the winter quarters of a local circus, only to meet with an untimely end.  The money is taken, and the mystery begins to unfold.  As the police continue their investigation, bank notes begin appearing in the area of the circus' winter quarters, and Inspector Elliot (Leo Gurn) suspects the person or persons involved in the theft may be hiding out at the circus.  We soon meet various performers of the circus, which sets up a whole load of red herrings, as the performers are presented as a volatile lot, prone to acting like overgrown children.  Among the performers is Gregor (Christopher Lee), the lion tamer who always wears a mask to conceal his horrible disfigurement due to a supposed accident involving a rambunctious kitty.  The inside man's body is discovered on the grounds of the circus, and a performer is also kakked shortly thereafter, reinforcing Inspector Elliot's suspicions with regards to the killer and his/her connection to the circus.  More and more clues (most useless) are thrown our way as histories are revealed, and the plot gets fairly convoluted.  Klaus Kinski is listed as an actor in the film, but his role is limited as an original heist man who followed the money to the circus.  I would say he has about five minutes of total screen time, and absolutely no development for his character is presented, making his role essentially useless.  So who is the mastermind?  Who is responsible for murdering various individuals throughout the film?  What secret does Gregor hide behind his mask?

As others have stated, this would appear to be a horror movie on first glance, but it isn't.  It's really a somewhat bloated mystery/drama, presenting, rather clumsily, a number of suspects.  The way motives were thrown around so obviously will make you groan, and when you finally do discover the identity of the mastermind behind the crimes and his reasoning, you may be disappointed.  There was little, if anything, that would have drawn the viewer to pick that individual as the criminal, other than that's how is was written in the script.  I do like Christopher Lee a lot, but his role here seems to be more of the producers using the star power of his name more than anything else to sell the movie.  Leo Genn provides a great performance as the harassed by his supervisor inspector, more or less riding out the plot threads until they produce the culprit.  He does piece together the puzzle near the end, but given the information we had offered by the film, I am still unsure how he came to the conclusions he did, making the whole `mystery' element a little awkward and clunky.  The film started out strong, but ended with a bit of a sputter for me.  And I have to say, I kinda felt sorry for the animals shown, the lions and elephants, as they all looked rather tired and sickly, as is often the case of circuses and zoos, despite even the most well-meaning efforts to care for the animals.

Blue Underground provides a really nice looking wide screen print here, along with a number of special features, including a commentary track by director John Moxley, American and U.K. trailers for the film, poster, press book and still galleries for the film, and very detailed talent bios of actors Christopher Lee and Klaus Kinski.  The film here runs 91 minutes, compared to a meager 65 minutes on a previous VHS copy I saw, suggesting that maybe this is a truly restored version.  In the end, I would say this is a three star release of a two star film.  By the way, I really loved the tagline for this film, `The most horrifying syndicate of evil in history!'  A syndicate, to me, at least, implies more than just one person...but okay, let's go along...'The most horrifying...in history'?  Oh bruther...talk about `selling it'.

7989882,3,B000096I9T,"Christopher Lee must have been very busy back in the '60s. He was taking every movie role in sight.  Perhaps that explains why one of Hammer's major stars surfaced in this minor thriller.  To set the record straight, despite an attempt to package this flick as a horror film, it's really a crime melodrama that begins well but falters along the way.  A diabolic super criminal takes refuge with a British circus after masterminding an armored car robbery.  It gets better.  Lee plays the hooded lion-tamer/knife thrower that leads the suspect list.  If we follow the logic, the filmmaker wanted a popular actor such as Lee just so he could hide his face behind a hood for much of the film.  Go figure.  The diminutive Skip Martin is great as Mr. Big, the small chap with a big attitude.  Distinguished actor Leo Genn must have been amused by his role as a police detective.  He keeps looking bemused and fatuous even after being chewed out by his boss.  The cadaverous Klaus Kinski is around just long enough to suffer a stabbing pain.  There is also the usual bevy of circus girls in their revealing costumes.  As all circus pictures, the film uses screen time of real circus performers doing their acts.  For American viewers, the European backgrounds may add a certain charm.  The flick takes itself too seriously to be enjoyed as camp.  As a straightforward thriller, it's harmless fun.  Depending on which edition you consider, remember that a budget priced DVD is better than a cheap VHS tape, but just barely.  Beware chopped up edited editions!  ;-)",1069286400,2,1557,4.742537313432836
7989883,4,B000096I9T,"I was hugely disappointed that this wasn't at all what I hoped it was...that being a Euro-shocker along the lines of ""Circus of Horrors"". What I found instead is an OK mystery based on a novel by Edgar Wallace that's fairly engrossing with some neat surprises. After an admittedly good opening about an armored car heist, the story shifts to Barbarini's Circus which has an atmosphere rife with tension: assumed identities, jealous romance, a dangerous lioness named Sheba, her hooded tamer Gregor (Christopher Lee), a shifty knife thrower and a blackmailing dwarf named Mr. Big (Skip Martin). The stolen money lands in the circus and an escaped member of the heist is murdered by...a knife thrower. Scotland Yard is soon on the circus grounds and there are red herrings galore. The heist member's body is found and Mario the knife thrower's beautiful assistant Gina (luscious Margaret Lee), who knows something, is also killed by...a knife thrower. The killer is never revealed until the end. To be honest, despite my initial disappointment, this is a colorful, beautifully photographed, well acted (if a tad overplotted) diversion that should please hardcore mystery fans. The music score is moody Euro-jazz flavored and blares at key moments which I found kind've fun. It's not a horror film at all. Instead, it's laced with bizarre atmosphere and genuine intrigue that kept me guessing right up to the end. I did not guess the killer's identity.  Good supporting cast with Suzy Kendall as Gregor's ""niece"", Anthony Newlands as Barbarini, Klaus Kinski as a mystery drifter connected to the heist, Leo Genn as the ringmaster-cum-hero and especially Skip Martin as the nasty Mr. Big. The DVD from Blue Underground is superb in quality. I don't know why this was cut so severely when making the rounds as ""Psycho-Circus"". There's no gore or nudity. Just solid, well made storytelling. The action shifts between Scotland Yard and the circus and is rather tame...yet it sustains your interest. I have to recommend it as a pretty good mystery for fans of the genre and for fans of good British thrillers. But, keep in mind that ""Circus of Fear"" is NOT a horror film. I hope it doesn't disappoint too many people because it IS rather good and deserves to be seen and appreciated for what it really is...a really decent mystery-thriller.",1064966400,15,2332,4.97948717948718
