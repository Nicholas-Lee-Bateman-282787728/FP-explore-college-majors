1420859,5,B00005B642,"fando and lis is a good start for anyone interested in viewing the amazing films of alexandro jodorowski. currently this is the only dvd avalible of his early work, allen klein (of apple records fame) unfortunatly has the secured rights to el topo and the holy mountain (his 2 masterpieces) and flatly refuses to ever re-release the films. this is unfortunate because the amazing dvd treatment that fando and lis has received would be as equally as amazing for el topo and the holy mountain. fortunatly these 2 films are widely avalible on video through some foreign distributors. the film transfer is astounding and the bonus features are great. an enlightening documentary on jodorowski is featured on the dvd with interviews with marcel marceau, mobius, and peter gabriel who goes on to say that genesis's landmark concept album the lamb lies down on broadway was inspired by the films of jodorowski. equally as enlightening are the stills and treatments for jodorowski's unmade film adaptation of frank herbert's dune.fando and lis is a good film but by far not his best, lets just hope that allen klein sees fit to finally release el topo and the holy mountain for a whole new generation of impressionables.",995760000,7,1212,4.946078431372549
1420860,5,B00005B642,"I bought this having been impressed by watching both 'El Topo' and 'Holy Mountain' a while ago (both unavailible in US; more information is at ...) and although lower budget this holds up very well to these later works.  The transfer is very good, especially considering it was thought lost for so long; although there are several instances of print damage. The real highlight of this disc, however, are the numerous extras.  The complete documentary 'Constellation Jodorowsky' runs at over an hour and is a very interesting insight into his career as a whole (not just his film making).  Jodorowsky's commentary is at times disjoint, and his accent makes him difficult to understand (although subtitles are availible) but he comes across extremely well as every bit the eccentric, offbeat character one would expect; as well as sharing many facts about the production and the film's troubled past.  The inclusion of the original 8-page handbill was a welcome addition for any collector. Now, here's hoping one day someone will get around the legal complications and give 'El Topo' and 'Holy Mountain' the same kind of treatment!",993859200,8,1129,5.0864864864864865

1420863,5,B00005B642,"This is the first feature film from Chilean avant-garde filmmaker Alexandro Jodorowsky, which caused riots on its premiere in Acapulco in 1968. It's a strange tale of a man and woman, who wander around a barren  landscape searching for the mystical city of Tar. And also to seek  enlightenment from an assortment of strange characters. It's not for  everyone, but if you like your movies out there in the extremes of  surrealism and symbolism, this one is for you. The DVD also includes a  interesting documentary where Jodorowsky is interviewed, and we learn of  his philosophy and opinions, which are always fascinating. A must own DVD  for fans of avant-garde cinema.",952646400,11,670,4.981981981981982
1420864,4,B00005B642,"Fans of the hyperbolic director Alejandro Jodorowsky (""El Topo"") should love this episodic psychodrama loosely based on an absurdist play by Fernando Arrabal.  Though obviously a first feature with uneven pacing and  often washed out over-exposed scenes, the film makes up for its deficits  with an abundance of surprising images.  Set in a devastated appocalyptic  landscape, we follow a young sadomasochistic couple on their desperate  search for a magical city named ""Tar.""  The girl, Lis,  is  paralyzed and must be pushed around on a rickety cart by Fando.  As in  ""El Topo"" a parade of emblematic characters appear out of nowhere  to taunt and teach them.  Many of these scenes have a wierd sense of humor  as when bowling balls are used as weapons, or Fando's mother force feeds  him hard boiled eggs.  Some of these visions appear more fully formed in  Jodorowsky's later films as when a live bird is pulled from the chest of  Fando's father.  It is difficult to watch the misogynist brutal torture  of Lis which intensifies toward the end of the film, but Jodorowsky's  intention is never to make the viewer comfortable.  Like the mute girl in  ""Sante Sangre,"" Lis portrays a certain male fantasy of the pure  woman as one who accepts torment with acceptance and forgiveness.  The  film was shot by Raphael Cokidi who went on to shoot Jodorowsky's next two  works and to direct allegorical films himself.  The feature length  documentory ""Jodorowsky Constellation"" is an added bonus and  portrays the director's current life in France.  There are some nice  excerpts from ""El Topo"" and ""The Holy Mountain"" but  curiously none from the later ""Sante Sangre.""  Also interviewed  are Marcel Marceau, Fernando Arrabal and Peter Gabriel though they are not  indentified by subtitles.  Unfortunately the long ""therapy""  session at the end  lessens the impact of this otherwise competent profile.  The package is well put together and includes a picture brochure from the  orginal showing of ""Fando and Lis.""",948412800,17,2009,5.058461538461539
1420865,5,B00005B642,"Jodorowsky's FANDO & LIS is a unique and memorable experience.  Adapted from the play by Arrabal, it is one of the most eerie and absurd quasi-narrative films I can recollect, short of some experimental Czech  pictures.
In an effort to overcome Lis's paralysis, Fando carries Lis on  his back (and pushes her on a cart) in search of the mythic city  ""Tar""; a discovery, in and of itself, which would cure her of the  ailment.  The rest of the film defies explanation.
If you like Fellini,  Goddard, or Resnais, you will LOVE Jodorowsky.  FANDO & LIS, Last Year  At Marienbad, and Weekend, are similar films.",945820800,7,607,4.704761904761905
1420866,5,B00005B642,"This is a very odd film that in its base, is pure surrealism, even if the other reviewer said it ""wasn't because it doesn't have a story to tell."" Well, just to correct him and his pretentiousness, it was ""surrealism"" and because you were not ""entertained"" or moved by any of it, that does not dismiss its pretensions. Bunuel and Lynch films need to be 'commercial"" in some respect in order to retrieve the funding that producers were willing to invest, while on this hand, this film was made by a madman and lunatic, purely to denounce conformist cinema. He didn't care if you were ""bored"" or even cried to tears, it was his attempt to put to film a Francisco Arrabal play from his memory, which was disjointed because of his drug use and other factors.

This is a pure work of art by Jodeowrosky and he succeeds in that. It is not to say that it is a simple film to watch, on the contrary, it is very difficult but I was rewarded at the end by the odd assortment of unusual characters and by the meaning of each situation, the ending was quite poignant and I even enjoyed the music and the peculiar dubbing of voices and the art from alchemistical books. For you literary folks, look for Juan Jos Arreola, the great Mexican writer who had a part in the film, although I wasn't able to determine what scene he was in. There is also a documentary on Jodeowrosky on the DVD, although crudely produced on cheap video, it none-the-less captures some sentiment of his. He explains his perspective on art, theology and he even plays with tarot cards and speaks about his ""spectacular failure"", the adaptation of Dune. Towards the end though, it becomes very inane because he is psycho-analyzing the camera man in a stupid scene while covering everyone in hog grease and I couldn't stand anymore of his ""new age"" proselytizing.",1101859200,3,1821,4.551829268292683
1420867,4,B00005B642,"Ever since I first heard about Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""El Topo,"" I wanted to see it. Supposedly on the surface a spaghetti western, but so much more underneath, the movie sounded delightfully bizarre in a way I often enjoy. Well, I have not gotten a chance to see this movie yet since it has not come out on DVD. When I saw the opportunity to watch ""Fando and Lis,"" an earlier film from the same director, I grabbed the chance figuring that something was better than nothing. I was wrong. While ""Fando and Lis"" does contain some interesting scenes, this Jodorowsky picture dwells deep in the land of surrealism. Nonsensical films do not usually bother me as long as there is some sort of touchstone to hang your hat on. A director can take his project completely over the top as long as a plot exists somewhere under the madness. This is the central problem of ""Fando and Lis."" The film, a totally improvised production based on memory and a one-page synopsis of a play written by Francisco Arrabal, never makes a bit of sense. It's theater of the absurd time here, folks, so prepare for the ultimate in weirdness. Fortunately, the disc also contains ""Constellation Jodorowsky,"" a documentary about the filmmaker and artist that follows a more traditional approach to storytelling.
""Fando and Lis"" tells the story of, predictably, Fando (Sergio Kleiner) and his main squeeze Lis (Diana Mariscal) in glorious black and white photography. The two live in a post-apocalyptic world, in an environment of desert climes and shattered cities. Earth as we know it is gone, so Fando and Lis begin a quest for the mythical city of Tar, a city that seems to promise hope and regeneration for the weary couple. The only possessions they have appear to be a drum, a phonograph, and a wooden cart in which Lis serenely rides. She cannot walk, for some reason, so her man pushes her around wherever they go. The two are a temperamental pair, with Fando often tiring of dealing with Lis's constant complaints. All of this information is the only thing we know for sure about the movie. You see, ""Fando and Lis"" soon embarks on a bizarre odyssey of disjointed scenes, sparse scenery, and downright odd secondary characters. Never before has such an incoherent movie found its way to my DVD player. And you thought Luis Bunuel or Salvador Dali were weird. Until you check out Jodorowsky, you ain't seen nothing yet. This movie would give Sigmund Freud a nervous breakdown.
I can offer no ample explanations for the unfolding silliness. Scenes and situations include a piano on fire collapsing and then reconstituting itself only to collapse again, a bunch of people rolling about in the mud while a religious figure cackles madly in the background, and a bunch of old ladies sitting around a table eating something that looks like eggs while a guy in a diaper lurches around in the background. You get more, such as a blindfolded Fando led around by women, a scene in which some strange guy drains blood from Lis's arm into a wine glass, and a funeral scene where Fando's mother lies down in her grave. Are you still here? Good, because I have not described my favorite scene yet. It's just as unfathomable as any other situation in the film, but it's so ridiculous that it bears mentioning. At one point, Fando stumbles over a bunch of Amazonian type women who chase him around a craggy hill while knocking him down with bowling balls. Yep, you heard right-bowling balls. Just when Fando thinks he has escaped these wacky women, another bowling ball comes crashing down a hill and fells our hero like he's a pin. Jodorowsky missed out on really giving the scene meaning by failing to shod these gals with bowling shoes. As for the music score, you have to listen to it yourself to believe how peculiar it is.
What could this madness possibly imply? Good luck figuring it all out. As far as I can tell, the film means whatever you want it to mean. I would not worry too much about extracting a coherent theme from ""Fando and Lis"" unless you want to end up in a rubber room for a few years. What really threw me for a loop was how much I enjoyed specific parts of the movie. I usually despise films this whimsical, but Jodorowsky's vision occasionally possessed a certain charm that made the whole thing worthwhile. That scene with the paint was interesting, as was the couple posing over tombstones. Yet, I would never attempt to recommend the movie to anyone else. It's way too abnormal for you to take my word that you should possibly watch the picture. You have to decide yourself whether to dive in to Jodorowsky's film
""Constellation Jodorowsky"" is a bit easier on the eyes and ears. The documentary runs nearly as long as ""Fando and Lis."" Consisting of lengthy interviews with the director about such diverse subjects as life, philosophy, and theology, ""Constellation"" shows us what the filmmaker does with his time nowadays. Apparently, he teaches some course at a university where he tosses off lots of new age aphorisms to a docile audience. These scenes run far too long and take away from the more interesting segments, namely the discussion about Frank Herbert's ""Dune."" Incredibly, Jodorowsky nearly directed the film adaptation of the book, going so far as to hire an artist to draw storyboards. His plans for ""Dune"" looked fabulous; it's too bad the project went to David Lynch. Only purveyors of atypical cinema should check out this disc. For me, I am still waiting for ""El Topo"" to come out on DVD.",1087084800,24,5498,4.72216441207076
1420868,3,B00005B642,"I find the basic dilemma in watching any avante garde cinema, especially that which came out in the 50's and 60's is that one truly cannot evaluate it based on any objective criteria.  Some might say this is true of any and all film, but upon watching ""Fando & Lis"" I discovered that I had very little to say beyond how I personally ""experienced"" the film.
If you watch the accompanying documentary, ""Constellation Jodorowosky,"" you might begin to understand the intent and the context of such films.  This, however, does not mean you will understand the film itself.  Not quite ""theater of the absurd,"" not quite true surrealism, this is what I like to call ""theater of the question mark.""  Upon watching it, you may find yourself with many questions that can only be ""answered"" by watching it or experiencing it again.
I have not seen all of Jodorowsky's opus, but there might be an opportunity for critique in comparing his works.  I commend this film for the experiment of watching it.  Should you desire more experiences like it, watch on!",1076803200,,1044,4.740331491712707
1420869,5,B00005B642,"Jodorowsky's once-lost film is a meditation on, fellow Panic Movement founder, Fernando Arrabal's play.  Following the travails, physical and spiritual, of the titular couple as they search post-apocalyptic landscapes for the mythic city of Tar.  Action and dialogue are mostly improvised from a one-page script.  True to the surrealist ethos, the symbols and theme are entirely open to the audience's interpretation.  F&L is not as cohesive or consistent as the three films that followed it.  It's often frustratingly episodic and Jodorowsky revels in his own amateurism.  However, while not for every taste (and really, what Jodorowsky film is?), F&L is still an essential surrealist document, worthy of comparison to Bunuel's finest.  Also, F&L offers rare insight into Jodorowsky's formative years.  A more elegant, innocent rendering of themes which would manifest as eye-splattering overload in his later works.  Fantoma has done an amazing job with the DVD transfer of an old print.  You also get the documentary, Le Constellation Jodorowsky as a bonus.  Cheaply shot and meandering, it is, nevertheless, worth the price of the disc - a rare chance to see and hear the director speaking openly about his life and art.  The director's commentary track, while difficult to follow, is also very worthwhile for Jodorowsky fans.",1070323200,5,1330,5.371980676328502

In my opinion it was such a great development of the script considering that Juan Jose Arreola (one of the greatest poets in Mexico *just died*) was a really important part in this situation. The Characters are also great, the nonsense situations puts the viewer into a labirynth of multiple landscapes where love & dislove, life & death, heaven & hell, meets all together.",1059091200,2,501,4.905882352941177

7936680,3,B00005B642,"This is Jodorowsky's first full length feature film from 1968, which is something of a homage to the silent era of films, as well as to films by surrealists, such as Luis Bunuel (Un chien andalou,1929) . In 1957 he did direct a short film, ""Les tetes interverties"" which was a mime adaptation of Thomas Mann's 1940's play ""The Transposed Heads"" (La Cravae, The Transposed Heads, The Severed Heads).

""Fando Y Lis"" is a road story, which follows Fando, and his paraplegic sweetheart Lis, through urban rubble, and desert badlands, looking for an unattainable, enchanted city, called Tar. This surreal adventure is full of odd events and unusual people. There are some cinematically interesting shots where where time is reversed, such as when a charred piano appears to be animated to life after crumbling to the ground, or when a doll is unburied from its grave of dirt. This later sequence reminded me of a scene from ""Vampyr"", where a shadow of a grave digger has the earth falling back onto his shovel. Jodorowsky's film is largely linear, but it does have these passages where time reverses that emphasizes the dreamlike, nonlinear, or surreal aspect of the story.

Jodoroswky has influenced other directors, including David Lynch (Eraserhead), and E. Elias Merhige (Begotten). He later followed this film with several others, including ""El Topo"" (1970), ""The Holy Mountain"" (1973), ""Santa Sangre"" (1989) and ""The Rainbow Thief"" (1990).",1268265600,,1440,5.0974576271186445

FANDO & LIS was Jodorowsky's first full-length motion picture, and it caused a riot when it premiered in Mexico in 1968. Jodorowsky even faced a deportation trial because of the controversy.

Remarkably, I found this DVD copy of Jodorowsky's FANDO & LIS at the public library. I checked it out. Initial impression -- a lot like Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's UN CHIEN ANDALOU or Jean Cocteau's BLOOD OF A POET. I watched FANDO & LIS not long after viewing Werner Herzog's AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD -- a strange film to mention in this review, perhaps, but oddly there's a similar theme here.

In Jodorowsky's movie, two lovers, Fando (Sergio Kleiner) and Lis (the pixie-like Diana Mariscal), embark on a journey for the mythical city of Tar. In Tar, all one's dreams come true, all one's earthly problems are solved. As Fando takes Lis to Tar, a journey-narrative begins. Lis is paralyzed from the waist down; Fando pushes her on a cart throughout the movie as she holds a phonograph and a drum. Lis hopes Tar will enable her to walk again.

Unlike Herzog's movie -- which was about a search for El Dorado, the mythical city of gold -- the main characters in this search for the mythical city of Tar are sympathetic -- especially Lis. (In Herzog's movie the main character is a sadistic megalomaniac.) They're portrayed as youthful, innocent, vibrant, and, of course, in love. At times Diana Marsical reminds one of Giulietta Masina from Fellini's films. Jodorowsky said this was a movie about how ""sadomasochistic society"" corrupts innocence.

En route to Tar, Fando and Lis encounter mud people, cavort in cemeteries, and experience Freudian flashbacks to their respective childhoods. The journey to Tar seems actually to be a psychological journey, weaving external events with the internal symbolism of the main character's psyches. The movie plays like a series of avant garde vignettes strung together end-on-end with the two main characters recurring in each one. It is in these vignettes that we learn more about Fando and Lis's backgrounds, as well as their relationship to each other.

In one encounter, a group of crossdressers swarm upon Fando, regale him, and proceed to dress him as a woman while simultaneously dressing the disabled Lis as a man. The two become mirror opposites of one another, briefly, as they discover they've been outfitted in each other's clothes. In another memorable and quite beautiful scenario (from which the DVD cover picture is taken), Fando paints his name all over Lis's body as she lays among discarded dolls.

One of the more stomach-churning encounters involves a blind man and his father, who, vampire-like, beg Lis for some of her blood. Fando consents to let them take it, and the father proceeds to extract some of Lis's blood from her arm with a syringe. I'm not sure if they filmed Diana Marsical (Lis) really getting her blood drawn, but it certainly looks like it. It's all one long camera shot -- the syringe going into the vein and the blood slowly filling the needle, then squirted into a small wine glass where the old man greedily drinks it. The blind son licks the glass clean. Pretty disgusting, and petty daring for 1960s cinema, too, if it's all real.

One of my favorite scenes is Fando's flashback to visiting his mom's deathbed as a youngster. His mom is grotesque and domineering, with a croaking, sinister voice that hardly sounds as if it belongs to a woman. She lays on her elaborate deathbed, hooked up to an absurd line of IVs and surrounded by candles. Her death bed is made up like a perverse Mardi Gras float and is pushed by scantily-clad ""nurses"" among a crowd of admirers in what looks like a large subterranean basement. The young Fando is clearly afraid of his mother, who thanks all the onlookers by dedicating her death to them, her ""fans.""

Fando is at turns loving and cruel to Lis. At one point he abandons her at the bottom of a circular pit that reminds one of a miniature version of Dante's hell. Lis is helpless and pitiable, and totally dependent on Fando. His resentment of her dependence and subsequent callousness to her seems to owe a bit to Federico Fellini's LA STRADA. In fact, FANDO & LIS was felt to be ""Fellini-esque"" by some of the early marketers of the movie; they tried to edit it early on to appeal to Fellini fans, according to the DVD liner notes. This DVD contains the original version, however.

In the end, Fando and Lis do not find Tar. Lis is never able to walk -- in fact, she dies. Fando visits her grave ""with a flower and a dog"" as he promised to her near the beginning of the movie. Inexplicably, Lis rises from the grave, nude, childlike and pure, able to walk in this dream-like sequence.

The documentary that accompanies the film is helpful in setting FANDO & LIS within the artistic milieu from which it arose. FANDO & LIS is essentially a product of the Panic Movement (""Panic"" after the Greek god Pan), a mainly Spanish and Latin American reaction to the course Surrealism had taken under the dictatorial guidance of Andre Breton. According to Jodorowsky, Breton had made Surrealism acceptable, respectable, and ""petit bourgeois"" -- it's appeal had spread to conservative art collectors when originally it was a shocking, threatening, and transgressive phenomenon. The Panic Movement sought to correct this by staging outrageous plays and art happenings that featured nudity, urinating on religious icons, cacophonous music, and the like. FANDO & LIS definitely translates some of this outrageousness to the big screen, what with its nudity, controversial subject matter (crossdressers, the blood drinking), and jarring images (the black dominatrix with the whip, Lis licking her lips amongst a pile of cow skulls, etc.).",1114560000,5,5999,4.895669291338582

Some argue that he is a latter day Bunuel whose non-linear style of storytelling illustrates the falsities and hypocrasies of the ruling class while others declare that he is a talentless poseur who incorporates his own LSD inspired ramblings into his scripts and ""non linear"" is just a fancy way of saying his plots make no sense.

Many directors have woven the search for the Meaning of Life into their plots. Ingmar Bergman, David Lynch, Carl Dreyer and Luis Bunuel among them especially. The thing about Jodorowsky is not that his characters are looking for the meaning OF life, rather they are seeking to give meaning TO their lives. This is not wrong per se, but the problem is the characters in EL TOPO, THE HOLY MOUNTAIN and even FANDO AND LIS all find what they are seeking, and that is where the problems begin, not end. While having a goal and dedicating your life to it is laudible in itself, once you have satisfied that goal where do you go? Is Life still meaningful once you have solved Meaning of same?

Not to reveal the ending of any of these movies but: There are disastrous results for everyone in these pictures once they reach their goal . . .which turns out to be not what they expected anyway. Fando and his crippled girlfriend Lis are on a journey to the legendary magical city of Tar where, both believe, Lis will be able to walk and all their problems will be solved. Along the way they meet all sorts of odd characters (the only kind who inhabit the Jodorowsky universe) and Fando tries to leave several times only to return repentant.

Jodorowsky seems to share a dislike of the upper classes of society with Bunuel. The representatives of the upper crust we encounter are narrow minded ineffectual idiots anxious to maintain the status quo because that is the only life they know and they are unwilling to accept change (think about the townsfolk in EL TOPO and compare them to the rich people in VIRIDIANA). Tar may be no more real than El Dorado or Atlantis but as long as they are actively involved in searching for it, Fando and Lis's live have meaning.

The question ultimately put before them and, by proxy, also before us is this: Is the realisation of this goal worth it? And what happens if we arrive at the wrong answer? Of course with Jodorowsky the wrong answer is the only one anyone ever seems to reach, EL TOPO being the prime example of this. FANDO AND LIS reaches a climax which, while not wholly unexpected, is no less heartbreaking because we saw it coming.

This film was withdrawn for several film festivals worldwide and allegedly caused riots when it was shown in Brazil. It was withdrawn from distribution for many years by Jodorowsky himself but is now available on videocassette and DVD. So is this man an unsung genius? You figure it out, I'm going home.",1108512000,11,2928,4.601532567049809
