She doesn't notice the grainy texture of the animation or that most of the characters sound the same, as I didn't either as a kid! I'm glad I bought this and will be ordering the next set soon.",1330646400,,336,3.9558823529411766
3422250,1,B00191AEY6,"When I purchase a DVD collection of a retro TV show I do NOT appreciate, upon putting it into my player, having FORCED TRAILERS of that degenerate, no talent, no morals, no heart remake crap fest known as the New Care Bears (it's CGI garbage, too). All the nostalgia I was feeling for my purchase was ruined in that moment - the very first moment upon playing it. I see this company won't let you try to expose our children to wholesome programming without them trying to IMMEDIATELY brainwash kids into wanting to see the new remake. Also, it shows a lack of respect for their customers. I spend money on your product and you SPAM me right off the bat with forced trailers? You package it in the CHEAPEST cardboard, KNOWING it won't hold up to kids using it a lot? And even up converted to 1080p, this still looks super grainy and dark? No remaster? Picture quality stinks big time. They don't even respect their own franchise. Thanks a lot for cheapening a wonderful show.",1317254400,8,974,4.508474576271187

Here's a Awesome overview of the entire Nelvana series: http://www.carebearzone.com/carebear/
Reference: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Care_Bears_episodes",1416873600,,4195,4.759615384615385
8271531,5,B00191AEY6,Loved these in childhood and I have now purchased them to for my own daughter to watch.  Just as cute as I remember!,1416700800,,116,4.043478260869565
8271532,3,B00191AEY6,"I must remember the cartoons differently, because as an adult now I was disappointed in showing these cartoons to my 27 month old.  He enjoys Thomas the Train, which teaches about mistakes, pride, and helping others.  He also enjoys Zerby Derby and Sara and Duck, which air on the television channel Sprout.  Both have great overall social learning skills.  Sara and Duck shows relationships and imagination.  Zerby Derby teaches teamwork, problem solving and not giving up-try again.  I thought the care bears would be a great addition to these other entertaining programs.  Once I put the DVD in the player and started watching I was shocked to hear the word dumb.  The episode was expressing concern for litter, but it was illustrated so scary.  Another had two boys wreck a house.  It seemed so violent.  The plots were based on things to teach children, but they were just displayed in a way that didn't seem to fully teach.  The animation was a little blurred.  It could be due to change in technology over the years.

I gave it three stars because the physical condition of the DVD's were sound.  The care bears do stress kindness to each other, others, and getting others to care for themselves and others.  The bears in general are adorable and likable.  I have a feeling that if I would have gotten the updated versions of the care bears that stories and dialogue would have been better.",1414800000,,1397,4.730290456431535
8271533,5,B00191AEY6,"*Before I go any further I want you to know there where 2 separate TV series within this time frame. The first series(THIS ONE)was made by DIC with Professor Coldheart and Frostbite as your villains and the second one was made by Nelvana that has NoHeart,Shreeky and Beastly. If your looking for the Nelvana series look for the Care Bears:The Original Series Collection that should get you what you want*

The Care Bears was a good series to watch in the late 80's early 90's at a young age. I remember my mom taped them on VHS cassette tapes so I could watch them anytime I wanted too. Not like today where Dora the Explorer and Spongebob Squarepants have been scientifically proven to kill childrens brain cells. Not here the Care Bears teach you the difference between right and wrong. Things from being jealous of a new baby in your family to prank calling 911. This is a 2 disc set with 22 episodes  Disc 1

8271535,5,B00191AEY6,I loved the Care Bears as a child and was excited to see that they are on dvd now. All of the classics that I had recorded on a VHS back in the day are now on this dvd. I couldn't be happier.,1369872000,,191,3.4651162790697674
8271536,5,B00191AEY6,"Wanted to introduce my daughter to the care bears I grew up with.  She loves them (she's only three but loves care bears).  They are definitely dated though - you will laugh at a few things like the clothes and the hairstyles, but the old lessons are timeless.",1356998400,2,260,4.395833333333333
8271537,5,B00191AEY6,"This brought back so many memories from watching these when I was a kid, I know want to say there are more, just don't know where to get them, but I love this set",1356307200,,162,3.7941176470588234
8271538,4,B00191AEY6,"I bought these for my daughter and she likes them a lot. I didn't remember some of the name calling (nothing terrible...dummy and stuff like that). I'd forgotten some of the old villains but it all came back to me! They are not scary like some are on the full-length movies. The color quality is about the same as the old VHS tapes my mom has but I think that adds to its charm. :) Overall it's a very fun piece of my childhood to share with my kids, especially for the price.",1342051200,,476,4.129032258064516
