5311999,4,B009B0L3L0,"Dr. Strangelove...is the story plausible?  I was alive during the Cuban missile crisis - and yes Americans thought that world wide nuclear destruction was possible if the commanders in chief of the two nuclear powers were reckless in their decision making. Alas,  I never understood that the Soviets made the colossal mistake of giving power to destroy the earth to much lower level submarine officers - men who could act without clear orders from the Kremlin.  When one Russian submarine was being harassed by American destroyers during the crisis, the vessel captain thought the superpowers had already started World War III.  So...the commander of the vessel gave the unthinkable order to launch his ""secret weapon"" immediately. Thankfully, military protocol required two other persons on the submarine to agree with his decision.  One did...one did not. Our savior?  Basil Archipov.

As it turned out, naval officer Basil Archipov had earlier been on board a Russian nuclear submarine K-19 which had serious reactor problems.  It unleashed deadly radiation and killed quite a few crew members trying to deal with the problem. Officer Archipov knew first hand the horrors of atomic radiation and he must have used that experience to veto the decision to launch nuclear bombs at the United States.  (Later he died from that radiation)

When too many are using guns or car bombs to attack civilians, innocents, even children, it is reassuring to know that there are still clear thinking individuals who have the sense to put an end to ""grand violence.""

From my heart, I thank you Mr. Archipov; I do hope your wisdom and restraint prevails in the future.

I gave the movie 4 stars rather than 5 because it only hints at the Soviet dissatisfaction with Basil Archipov and the submarine crew when the vessel limped back to Russia after being forced to surface and return home.  That part of the story needs to be told also.",1383609600,13,1922,4.96875

5312002,5,B009B0L3L0,I think that this episode is one of the best done by Secrets of the Dead. It was very interesting and chilling to know that one man prevented WWIII and possibly the destruction of the world. It's good to know a little something about the nuclear submarine K-19 (nicknamed the Widowmaker) before you watch this episode.,1359072000,11,318,4.696428571428571

PBS occasionally produces these historical documentaries suitable for a 1-hour TV show, and later releases them on DVD.  They make for some pretty interesting histories, and the profit is used by PBS to help fund new projects.
This one is about the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, and in particular the mission of 4 Soviet submarines.
As the US became aware of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and demanded their removal, Russia sent 4 submarines each armed with one nuclear missile, to dock at a harbor in Cuba (to be used as counter pressure to US demands).  Later as the US announced a naval quarantine, Moscow communicated to them not to enter the harbor but to make to the Sargasso sea (near Cuba) and there standby undetected until they received further instructions.
Several facts then complicated the situation.  The sub commanders were authorized to fire on attacking vessels without approval from higher up.  However launching their nuclear missile would require the approval of the head of the Navy, who was on board one of the submarines.
Russia would have sent nuclear-fueled subs on this mission but for a meltdown on board one of their nuclear powered subs not long before, which led them to ground the rest of that fleet until they could prevent a recurrence.  As a result the subs they sent on this mission were of the older diesel-electric variety.  They had to resurface every 12 hours or so to charge their electrical systems (the film didn't explain the science of that) which put them at a much greater risk of being spotted.  Plus, they did not have air conditioning.  The Sargasso Sea was quite warm at the time, and with all the heat generated by the submarine, the sailors were laboring in well over 100 F temperatures with no fresh air or breeze.
The US had been developing anti-sub technology for the prior decade, and quickly spotted 3 of the 4 subs (one never did get detected).  They engaged in a naval harassment campaign designed to force the subs to surface.  The Russians onboard however didn't know the intentions of the US fleet: would it actually fire on them once they were visible?  They were supposed to keep silent until contacted again by headquarters, but headquarters was inscrutably silent.
The tale alleges that just one of these missiles could have destroyed much of the US atlantic fleet that was gathered around them, and the commander of the harassed sub wanted to launch.
But the head of the navy refused to grant permission.  Interestingly he had actually been on board the nuclear sub that had the meltdown, and seen a good number of the crew die of radiation sickness.  This apparently brought more vividly to his consciousness the terrible disaster that a nuclear war would be.
Sadly, on return to Russia, having prevented World War III, he was treated not as a hero but more like a traitor.  Some time after that he himself died of cancer of the kidney, which another Russian states was a result of his exposure to the radiation on the submarine.  The narrator states there were a number of other cases of kidney cancer in these mariners, something that I didn't know was associated with radiation.  I wondered if the nature of isotope exposure on board the submarine was different enough from what you would get on land from fallout, to cause substantially elevated kidney and urinary tract tumors.
If you come across any other PBS historical documentaries, occasionally they are a bit overly dramatic, but they are generally quite interesting.  I rate this B+.",1448496000,7,3568,4.794453507340946
