8632163,5,B00HEXXHYC,"May the Gods of visual entertainment bless Thunderbean Animation for their efforts.  The small company manages to find and restore obscure cartoons and animated shorts that you are not likely to see elsewhere.

This collection spotlights industrial animated shorts, such as the way oil means progress for America, and how advertising on radio has its advantages over television promotion.  If you take into consideration that companies who paid for these shorts did so in the early 1950s, it's not as ironic to talk about ""our friend, Atomic Energy"" and its use in war without mentioning Japan or the number of people killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The shorts have a P.R. and selling agenda, and that's advertising.

The quality of the shorts varies, but they are more than just watchable in quality and important to any fan of animation or American history in the second half of the last century. Listen closely for the voice of June Foray, who did so many, many voices in cartoons, especially ""Rocky and Bullwinkle.""  You'll hear her staple ""cackling witch"" and ""giggling girl"" characters.  Worth the price of admission alone.  Thanks, Thuderbean.",1410393600,2,1153,5.095744680851064
8632164,5,B00HEXXHYC,"Just ordered this and received it promptly. I must admit I was a bit skeptical as to what the quality would be but was pleasantly surprised. The DVD arrived shrink wrapped and the disc itself was in excellent condition and free of scratches and the ever annoying handlers fingerprints.
As for the content: MAN ALIVE! This stuff is pretty much impossible to find anywhere else and it is just a gold mine of mid century animation design. The quality of the prints varies but I was still surprised to see just how good all of this looked and sounded on my screen.
For the record, I bought volume one last summer and was very pleased as well. Not sure where or how 'Thunderbean' got hold of these gems but they are absolute gold. If you've got more, please keep em coming! I will happily purchase more!",1396224000,4,798,4.472602739726027
8632165,5,B00HEXXHYC,"This is an excellent, colorful collection of industrial shorts that were not meant for the general public.  The artwork, most of it from the talented masterminds between Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoing-Boing, yes UPA, is astounding.  A real feast for the eye!  The stand-out is THE RHAPSODY OF STEEL (1959) made for US Steel.  The jacket on the box lists it as ""big budget,"" and indeed it is.  Some of the intricate artwork rivals Disney's dinosaur sequence from Disney's FANTASIA.  No exaggeration!  Running over 25 minutes, it shows the ""evolution"" of the steel product.  In gorgeous color.  Another well-made short feature is MAN ALIVE, an amusing cartoon with fantastic graphic design about the essential importance of being checked for....cancer.  Very funny, truthful, and entertaining..  I also liked LOOK WHO'S DRIVING. a driver's safety lesson.  Thunderbean has done their best to ""clean up"" these mini-features for this DVD, and they look great!  I liked this volume better than volume one.  Well worth it.  A nice way to spend a Saturday afternoon.",1395619200,6,1056,5.129411764705883
