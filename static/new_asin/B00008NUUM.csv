1855188,5,B00008NUUM,"'The Unsaid' is a distinct movie, in that it makes many different attempts in the name of alleviating suspense in a film. Psychology and the problems enhanced by its nature usually form the grounds of the plots of most American movies. This movie, is an addition. But, it goes beyond that state, by presenting a psychological quandary and developing on it until the end of the movie.
To be more specific, Andy Garcia plays the therapist, who has lost his son recently by his suicide. One of his fellows asks for help in a case of one of her patients, Vincent Kartheiser who comes out to have an extraordinary past. Having sworn not to deal with anymore patients, Garcia still cannot refrain himself from seeing and helping him. The fact that Andy hasn't been able to forget the pain of his son's loss will make Andy's therapy of Vincent very special, because after some time with him, Vincent will reminisce Andy's own son.
Moreover, in the course of the movie, what you think you know will be altered by the surprising revelations. Different pasts will merge with others. The movie will become a thrilling psychological tension. You definitely do not want to miss this movie, by any means. Nothing, but 'The Unsaid' will be on your mind for a long time, after you see the movie.",1053475200,55,1279,4.663716814159292
1855189,5,B00008NUUM,"This movie is one of the more original ""thrillers"" I have seen, being a psychological movie with a few unexpected twists and turns.  There is no clear protagonist in this movie, as each character has someone or something against him or her, and holds grudges against many elements of the world.
I can see why this movie never made it into American cinemas.  It does not have that Hollywood appeal.  The characters don't live in mansions, they don't have glamorous lives, and there is hardly any romance throughout the movie.  It portrays real people, not stereotypes, and attempts to dig into the depth of the human mind.  It can be devastating, and does not have a clear happy ending.
I would recommend this to people who want to watch a movie with a different feel to it.",1047513600,18,773,4.613138686131387

That doesn't seem to bother most people, though, so if it doesn't bother you, you may enjoy this as an effectively done thriller.",1438819200,2,421,4.861111111111111

1855206,5,B00008NUUM,"ABSOLUTE SPOILER... DO NOT READ IF NOT WATCHING FILM YET.

I just saw this film tonight on TV, and as usual I go to IMDb DETAILED discussion boards where every single detail of a film is put under a microscope and hundreds of questions are asked, when having any doubts of something,  Amazon ALSO has these discussion boards below on the review pages, and I WISH people wouldl USE them but they don't seem to.  This issue seemed to me to be SO important a life issue aven to someone like myself without children by CHOICE, that I could not RESIST posting this here for those who DO have such issues like this film has in it.  To ME also, I couldn't understand WHO or HOW a mother could sexually abuse her young little son of this age, who is even BELOW puberty, though that wasn't the REASON i went to read about the film, it was one of my thoughts, and maybe that of many others who watch this film... I found it utterly heartbreaking but a wonderful post written by and to the credit of Manuel-Hoerth at IMDb.  It can also be seen exactly as below, at  ...>

""""""""""This movie was great it was very realistic - but of course it was only as realistic as a movie CAN be. There are limitations to what they can or should depict. Should they have scenes of actual child molesting in them? No! That would be in bad taste, morally wrong and difficult to film without actually molesting a child. But at the same time they have to make it clear to the audience that the child was sexually abused because that is important to the plot, so while they can't show the actual child abuse they have to depict something and have to at least hint at it. So what they end up showing is the mother obviously having sex, but not showing with whom and then have a naked son hide in the closet as soon as daddy comes home indicating that she was sexually abusing her own son.
That's pretty much the only way for them to convey to the viewer what happened without having to show more disturbing imagery. They don't actually show it, they just hint at it, and the viewer fills in the blanks.

A lot of people think that a woman couldn't sexually abuse a little kid that hasn't even reached puberty yet. That's because they think for it to count as sexual abuse it has to include actual intercourse. But that's not how it is.
So of course in reality it's not the way they hinted at it in the movie. In most cases when a mother sexually abuses her son it's much more subtle and covert and thus also difficult to detect - but the damage to the child in a psychological sense is just as severe.

There are quite a lot of support groups for people who have been sexually abused by their parents. And I found that about 30 to 40% of the people there are men who as a child have been sexually abused by their mother. So it's not as uncommon as we may think. It's only that sexual abuse coming from the mother is often times not as obvious and not as easy to detect as when it come from the father.

So all the stuff that some people said on here about the movie being unrealistic because mother-son incest wouldn't really happen is belony. It DOES happen and it does happen much more often than some people would like to admit. And it's precisely because some people don't wanna believe it that it often stays undetected for a long time.

Of course because I have the desire to raise awareness about this issue, I wanna make this more clear and wanna clear up this misconception. Can a woman rape a boy? Not exactly. But can she sexually abuse him? Definitely. But there might not be actual intercourse like there would be when a man rapes a woman. Not so much because she couldn't physically, but because actual sexual intercourse isn't what those women desire the most. What they desire the most is romance and to have a lover who cares, loves and cherishes them (in a very sexual sense but not necessarily including intercourse).

So while a bastard of a father might turn to his daughter when he can't have sex with an adult. A bi*ch of a mother turns to her son not when she can't have sex with adults, but when there is a lack of romance and love and appreciation in her love life. She feels that she can't get the kind of love and romance and appreciation she desires from adult lovers, so she goes looking for it elsewhere and a son is the easiest and most readily available substitute lover because if she where to turn to a boy that is a stranger to her she might have second thoughts about it and maybe she herself would think that it would be wrong. But in the case of her own son she can easily pretend that her love for him and the love that she will now start asking from him would be the normal love mother and son normally have for each other, even though she of course knows that the kind of love she will actually demand now goes well beyond that.

So that's how it is in reality. It might eventually lead to rape and sexual intercourse - but it doesn't have to. But even if it doesn't lead to that, it's still devastating to the child psychologically. """"""""""",1414454400,2,5047,4.288865546218488

1855226,2,B00008NUUM,"The Unsaid (Tom McLoughlin, 2001)

Here's a rule of thumb for you: any time the description of a piece of media, be it a book, a movie, a radio program, a scribble, what have you, begins with the words ""in the tradition of,"" that piece of media is going to be bad. Very, very bad. Still, I was overly fond of Andy Garcia (before he got mixed up with Steven Soderbergh, anyway), so I had to see this movie. Which is ""in the tradition of Primal Fear"", according to the box. Ay caramba.

Garcia plays Michael Hunter, a therapist who goes into early retirement after the suicide of his son and the breakup of his family, coming into public only for the odd lecture now and then. After one of them, he is approached by Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo of The West Wing), a former student of his now a caseworker, and asks him to look over the case of a teenage boy who has everyone but her fooled. You know where this is going, right?

To its credit, I did see a few places where it looked as if it were going to veer off into the territory of slick, complex psychological thriller. It manages to avoid doing so, however, at every turn. The film makes regular reference to Thomas (Angel's Vincent Kartheiser) resembling Hunter's son Kyle, and at one point, it looks as if Thomas is going to try and play on that. There's one reference...and then that entire line of thinking disappears from the script. It's as if they tried to do it one way, decided to do it another way, didn't quite get everything revised out of the script from the first way, and then failed to catch the error. At least, I hope that's the case; if it was actually meant to come off like this, screenwriter Miguel Tejada-Flores' heart wasn't really in it. (After checking his recent credits, which include such timeless fare as Darkness and Rottweiler, however, I find I could also be incorrect in that. He could, really, just be that bad.)

There is a rule I have with ""In the tradition of..."" films most of the time: you're better off watching the movie that the coattail-riding dog is in the tradition of. In this case, the rule holds up. Maybe even better than most times. Garcia isn't enough to save this one. There's some serious eye candy in the triple-threat of Polo, a young Linda Cardellini, and Chelsea Field, but that's about it. * ",1183593600,2,2303,4.4349881796690305

1855242,4,B00008NUUM,"Michael Hunter (Andy Garcia) is a brilliant child psychologist / professor who is well respected in his field by his colleagues and his students. Problem is he never expects the suicide of his son. This tragic event rips his family apart sending them all in different directions.

Many years later, after a speaking event for his latest book, a former student approaches him with a case she's been working on. A young man who witnessed his mother's murder by his father when he was younger is about to turn eighteen and potentially be released into the public if approved. After some corroding Hunter agrees to see him.

Hunter is instantly taken with the young Tommy Caffey (Vincent Kartheiser) because of his soft personable demeanour and quick wit. Something about him reminds him of his son. After his visit he agrees to continue seeing Tommy but not treating him. More and more Tommy is meshes with Hunter's memories of his son and soon the lines become blurred.

Things aren't as they seem as both sides are hiding their true selves from themselves and everyone else. As the meetings continue Tommy becomes more and more afraid that Hunter is not going to recommend him for release and develops a plan to throw the doctor off his game.

I really liked this film. Kartheiser is definitely a scene stealer with those poetic eyes that switch from teary to deadly in a heart beat. Garcia is what Garcia does. His dialogue is believable and his heartache palpable. After Tommy's gut reaction at a train station rave where he has a run in with a young woman who wants more than he give the storyline was pretty much predictable but the cast was able to keep it interesting. Definitely worth watching. I will watch it again.

1855247,3,B00008NUUM,"Relatively early on in ""The Unsaid,"" psychiatrist Michael Hunter (Andy Garcia) gives a lecture at his alma mater where he explains that sometimes a person experiences something so horrible that they make up a fake memory to cover it up.  Although Hunter is speaking to students and colleagues, we in the audience know that we should be taking notes as well and that this theory is a vital clue to unraveling the mystery of the movie.  The problem is that despite some feints in other directions, the clue is to be applied to the case of Thomas Caffey (Vincent Kartheiser), who is about to become of age and unless some body comes up with a good reason is about to be released from state care.

What horrible crime did Thomas commit?  Nothing.  The story is that he came home and found that his father (Sam Bottoms) had murdered his mother (Sarah Deakins), and was traumatized by the experience.  Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo), a former student of Hunter's, persuades him to look at Thomas' case.  Hunter has not taken any clients in the three years since his son committed suicide and Thomas looks enough like his son to get things jumbled in the psychiatrist's mind.  This is dangerous and unethical, but this is movie so we are not concerned with such things.

That is good, because Thomas becomes involved with Shelly Hunter (Linda Cardnellini), the psychiatrist's estranged daughter.  The death of his son destroyed his marriage, and in his pain and despair Hunter ignored his surviving child.  But putting his own house in order never occurs to Hunter and Thomas is able to get some information from Shelly that allows him to play his own games during the therapy sessions.  Now, this could be interesting, even though Thomas does not seem smart enough to really take advantage of it.  Thomas clearly has a dark secret and the clenched fist he keeps making when people say the wrong thing to him speaks to a potential for violence.  It is just a question of when he will explode.

What sinks ""The Unsaid"" is both the setup for the big payoff and the big payoff itself.  One of the girls from Shelly's school is murdered and the police are sniffing around the facility Thomas is kept in.  Then there is Shelly's ex-boyfriend, who tends to get drunk and angry, especially when Thomas gets in the way.  You expect this bad blood to come to blows and it sort of does, but we do not really know.  If at the end of a film you cannot tell if the red herrings were red herrings or not, then there are some major problems.  But the fatal blow is when we find out (dramatic pause) the truth.  What was ""unsaid"" finally gets said, but we do not really get to hear it and when we find out the big dark secret I am perfectly willing to admit that I never saw this coming.  But, on the other hand, I would never want to see that coming.

Garcia turns in a fine performance and works hard to keep everything together, but this screenplay really does not play fair with the audience.  Not only does Thomas have something that is unsaid with regards to the death of his mother, so does Hunter in terms of the suicide of his son.  This is really fool me twice territory, and really underscores that this psychiatrist should not be seeing this patient.  Again, I might forgive such dramatic manipulations if the payoff was worth it, but beyond the sheer shock value I do not think that it was and it cheapens the entire film.",1103500800,17,3408,4.527777777777778
1855248,5,B00008NUUM,"It has been well over a month since I watched 'The Unsaid', a psychological thriller and a hidden GEM of a movie, and I have to say ""WOW""! To see a movie with such hidden depths and emotion, and then try to go about your normal routine is nearly impossible.

From the moment Andy Garcia puts in an appearance to the bittersweet ending, I was mesmerized by these characters. Garcia portrays Michael Hunter, a ""once-brilliant psychologist"" living with guilt and loss over his son's tragic suicide. And then a young man enters his life and Garcia is given the chance to 'save' him.

Teri Polo (Meet the Parents), Linda Cardellini (Freaks and Geeks) and Vincent Kartheiser, a hot newcomer, join Andy Garcia in a stunning cast.

I have to admit that I am disappointed that there was not more hype about 'The Unsaid'. For a movie filmed in Regina, Saskatchewan, and with Andy Garcia and Mind's Eye Entertainment involved, this thriller deserved much more attention by the media!

As a Canadian author myself, I believe I know a great story when I see one. I give 'The Unsaid' three thumbs up! :)

1855249,4,B00008NUUM,"Andy Garcia gives one of his best performances in this little known thriller.  He plays a psychiatrist whose sixteen year old son commits suicide.  The opening sequence leading to this is extremely well done, with a disturbing sense of loss and hopelessness captured in Garcia's performance.  Three years later, Garcia has grown a beard, lost his wife and daughter, and has given up treating patients.  He is asked by former student Teri Polo to look at a young man who is about to be released from a home for disturbed boys.  Is he ready to come out into society?  Vincent Kartheiser is excellent as the young boy, who witnessed the murder of his mother by his father while a little boy.  Inevitably, Vincent becomes involved with Garcia's estranged daughter (Linda Cardellini), and we find out that nothing is quite as it seems.  Initially vague about the reason for Kyle's suicide, we find out later the tragic event which led up to this suicide, and we also learn much more about the murder of Kartheiser's mother.

One plot hole that hurts:  what happened to Troy, Shelley's brutish boyfriend.  Kartheiser shows up with his car, but where's Troy???

The Unsaid is sheer brilliance with an ensemble of talented actors I have never heard of before except for the underrated and superbly gifted Andy Garcia. This film has to definitely tug on some emotions from any viewer...
The Unsaid shows the beauty and compassion of one human being trying to reach out to another in desperate need and at the same time the flipside of the darkest corners of the human soul and fragmented psyche. One taboo subject in particular is at the heart of the subplot or twist !
Garcia portrays a psychologist/therapist who grieves over the suicide of his son in painful silence. A few years later he reluctantly takes on a case to help another boy in dire need of therapy after his mother was killed by his father. He takes the case after the urgence and insistance of one of his former students who is now a case/social worker. The social worker strongly feels that Tommy is not ready to be released into the real world for she fears the worst; Tommy is hiding much pain and anger. Also, to what lengths will Tommy go to to be released from the boys' center he had been placed in ? Soon, into the story the viewer begins to question who is actually helping or manipulating who as you will find out that Garcia's character is also in need of therapy and counseling ...
However, I was able to pickup and guess exactly what the horrifying secret was that Tommy had buried or wiped out of his mind (there are subtle clues). Does this make The Unsaid predictable? Not in the least because even if the viewer figures out what it is before it is actually revealed, the film has so much going for it that it won't matter...Need I mention that the acting is stupendous from the main characters !
It is a great pity that this film was not released into  ""Hollywood"" mainstream theatrical release. But, then again, The Unsaid is anything BUT mainstream. It is pretty cerebral and emotional. As a guy I am not ashmaed to say that a few scenes put a few lumps in my throat (so, I got veklepmft in my schinetezoid, big woop)...The main thing is is that this is one I highly recommended to my friends and family. It is there currently in any good video and reputable video store...However, since it is a limited release sleeper you may only find VHS copies as I did as most video rental places I went to did not order or put out the dvd versions (what else is new when you gotta make room for the popular mainstream titles)...",1069286400,18,2542,4.443254817987152
1855256,5,B00008NUUM,A supenseful story of a problematic kid played and nailed greatly by vincent kartheiser- you know the kid who played the son in the movie Alaska. And how he gets help from a psycholoist played wonderfully by Andy Garcia. Just remember not  everybody is what they seem!!!  one bad thing though there are no deleted scenes on the dvd even though the director mentions deleted scenes many times  in the director's commentary. So if you can live with that it is a really really great movie!!!,1069286400,,488,4.651162790697675

1855258,5,B00008NUUM,"This movie stays with you long after it's over.  ""The Unsaid"" speaks volumes about how you can totally miss what is going on with a person.  Andy Garcia is a Psycholoist who has lost his son through suicide.  His acting is superb in his portrayal of a man in the grip of grief and guilt.  But through an opportunity to work with another young man, he is faced with his own demons and those of the young man (brilliantly played by Vincent Kartheiser).  There are twists and turns and edge of your seat suspense up until the very end, which ends on a positive note.  I found myself watching this movie more than once.  But be prepared because the emotions involved can be quite intense.  Having a teenager of my own, I could relate to many of the relationships in the movie.  Looking for something a little different, I was surprisingly fortunate to stumble onto this gem.",1060041600,,870,4.490445859872612

7985880,5,B00008NUUM,"I watched this film late at night only to realize it was about my husband's problem. Though not exactly violent in the way the teenaged boy was, my husband suffered abuse in the way described and harbored severe personality quirks for over 60 years. This movie is MOST important in expressing the severe complications and ramifications of the ""unsaid"". With superb presentation and acting in this movie,  these issues are only now coming more to the forefront in our society around the world.",1447545600,,492,4.927710843373494

This film handles painful subject matter, to say the least.  I found myself in tears very early on.(!)  The story is powerful, the messages are important and the portrayals by all actors were credible and moving.  I wish to advise viewers though, that this one is heavy.  One should prepare for an emotional and heart-wrenching experience.",1440115200,,483,4.746987951807229
