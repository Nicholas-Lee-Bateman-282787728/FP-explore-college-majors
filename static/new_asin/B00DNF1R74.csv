5835240,5,B00DNF1R74,"my name is alex and i first started watching wrestling in 1998 and that was when the monday night wars was at its best. and i was only 10 years old. Goldberg was my hero. most wrestling matches i would watch would just flat out bore me.when goldberg wrestled,i was glued to the screen. Goldberg may not have been a great wrestler,but he did have MORE than 2 moves and do stuff that no other could do. the guy jackhammered the big show and held him in the air for 30 seconds. goldberg was my role model.i shaved my head and even got in trouble in school for spearing a classmate of mine. lol. anyways im so glad that one of my favorite wrestlers is getting a dvd set of his own. especially 3 discs worth. hopefully goldberg will be a character in the new wwe 14 game and maybe goldberg will come back to wwe and feud with Cryback and a rematch with brock lesnar. ill definently buy this dvd set the day it comes out and ill review it. matches i would like to see are against these opponets-hugh morrus,glacier,meng,scott steiner,raven,giant,lex luger,ddp,ric flair,scott hall,nash,hogan,sting,konnan,curt henning,christian,chris jericho,triple h,batista,orton,and the elimination chamber match.",1374537600,3,1193,4.8817733990147785

I was ticked about WWE not using Goldy's WCW music.  It's like they have to put their touch on everything.  It took away from the authenticity of the product.  The narrator sounded dry and uninterested as he should have considering there was no Goldberg involvement in the DVD.  All in all, it's a waste of money to buy... ...unless the asking price for a new DVD is $5.00.",1432771200,,543,4.37
5835307,3,B00DNF1R74,Wcw introduce the wrestling world to a star in the making by a man bill goldberg he was incredible he had two moves the spear and the jackhammer suplex slam pin. he was the first pro wrestler to be undefeated a streak better than undertaker wrestlemina it ran from 97-98 if you think brock lesnar beating taker at wm 30 was a shocker and conterversial look at the starcade match with kevin nash the match was horrible and outcome was just wrong . this has all the great matches  he had in this bussiness in wcw and wwe but the thing bothered me was no documentray on who he was and about him like edge and the rock and austin and triple h had  and no interviews and thoughts about oppents and victory ment to him . wwe theme was used not orginal wcw which was sad but i got use to it . the wwe run he had was good but too short i wished we had one more match goldberg vs austin they were the two biggest names during the monday night wars and wwe dropped the ball. i was hoping that he would come back after the dvd and blu ray came out  to be inducted into wwe hall of fame but that wasn't the case just another thing wwe puts out to gain profit from. goldberg was da man then now forever i bought this  to remember him. thank u bill goldberg,1431907200,,1243,4.040650406504065

I know however Bill Goldberg feels terrible about what he did and is very remorseful towards bret still anyway I thought this dvd was still interesting no matter how bad a wrestler bill was.,1426032000,,474,4.3977272727272725

5835314,5,B00DNF1R74,"I bought a copy of ""Goldberg:  The Ultimate Collection"" 3-disc set from a vendor here at Amazon, as a Christmas gift for myself.  I've been waiting for close to a decade for a Bill Goldberg professional wrestling compilation DVD set to finally be released onto home video, and now, it is finally here at last.  Bill Goldberg's pro wrestling career only lasted 7 years, but his star shined brighter than just about any other pro wrestler during the period between 1997 and 2004.  He had a start to his career unlike any other pro wrestler in history (or at least modern history), building up a 173-0 undefeated streak, and racking up wins against some of the greatest wrestlers of the latter half of the 20th Century, and doing so in a physical, dominating fashion.  On ""Goldberg:  The Ultimate Collection"", All of his important matches are included in this 3-DVD compilation, from his debut match in WCW with Hugh Morrus, to his WCW World Championship Title Match with ""Hollywood Hulk"" Hogan at the Georgia Dome, to the controversial taser incident in a WCW World Heavyweight Title Match with Kevin Nash that ended the undefeated streak, to his WWE debut match with The Rock, to Goldberg's legendary performance in his only appearance in an Elimination Chamber Match, to his ferocious battles with Triple-H for the WWE World Heavyweight Title, to his final match against Brock Lesnar, which, like fine wine, only gets better with time.  There are also some other great matches that Bill Goldberg has with other pro wrestling luminaries, such as Raven (a former ECW and NWA-TNA World Heavyweight Champion), Scott Hall (a former WWE Intercontinental Champion), Curt Hennig (a former AWA World Heavyweight Champion), Sting (a former WCW and TNA World Heavyweight Champion), ""Diamond"" Dallas Page (a former WCW World Heavyweight Champion), The Giant (also known as Paul ""The Big Show"" Wight) (a former WCW, WWE World Heavyweight, and WWE Champion), Ric Flair (a former NWA, WCW, and WWE Champion), Sid (also known as Sid Vicious, Sid Justice, and Psycho Sid) (a former WCW and WWE Champion), Scott Steiner (a former WCW World Heavyweight Champion), Christian (also known as Christian Cage) (a former WWE World Light Heavyweight Champion, NWA-TNA World Heavyweight Champion, ECW Champion, and WWE World Heavyweight Champion), Chris Jericho (a former WCW World Heavyweight Champion, WWE Champion, WWE World Heavyweight Champion, and the WWE's first Undisputed Heavyweight Champion), Mark Henry (a former WWE World Heavyweight Champion), Batista (a former WWE Champion and WWE World Heavyweight Champion),  Bill Goldberg wrestled against all of these men, and defeated virtually ALL of them (the Ric Flair match was ruled a ""no-contest"", due to outside interference).  No other professional wrestler in the ""Modern Era"" (post World War II) has a winning record like this, against THIS caliber of elite pro wrestling talent.  Bill Goldberg just STEAMROLLED over every wrestler he faced.  He was just that good of an in-ring performer.  The only thing missing from ""Goldberg:  The Ultimate Collection"" are some of his matches that he wrestled in between 2001 and 2003, when he wrestled in Japan for the All-Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and the New Japan Pro Wresting (NJPW) promotions.  That would make this pro wrestling video compilation complete.  But don't let that stop you from buying this Bill Goldberg pro wrestling video compilation.  No one can call themselves a TRUE pro wrestling fan unless they are able to see and appreciate for themselves how truly great of an in-ring performer that Bill Goldberg was during most of his 7-year career that is depicted in this 3-DVD set.  ""Goldberg:  The Ultimate Collection"" is an ABSOLUTE MUST to buy and own for your professional wrestling/sports entertainment video library.  Bill Goldberg shined like a supernova in the professional wrestling ring.  His pro wrestling legacy will most likely last forever.  We will never see a professional wrestler this talented, and this dominant, be triumphant against a ""Pro Wrestling Hall Of Fame"" list of wrestling talent like this ever again.  Buy ""Goldberg:  The Ultimate Collection"", so that you can share the history of this legendary, immortal wrestling talent for generations to come.",1420675200,3,4271,5.175872093023256
5835315,5,B00DNF1R74,"This set was well done. It had near every major match Goldberg had in WCW and WWE. Missing our his matches with Bret Hart but that is okay. They have both his matches with Sid and Nash. There are good matches with Hall, Henning and Sting. There are important title wins over Hogan and Triple H. There is that great match between The Rock and Goldberg. I think WWE was fair to Goldberg and showed how big a star he was in the 90s though he was a WCW star and not a WWE Guy. When he came to WWE he wasn't happy and they say he could have had a better run there. I liked his run there. His match with Lesnar sucked but they were too like styles. I think at Summerslam 03 he should have won the title. Triple H kind of killed his momentum early on. My favorite match was with Hogan. Not many people can say they beat Hogan and it cemented Goldberg as the next big star of the 90s. Cheers and enjoy!",1420329600,,894,4.0

As a nine year old kid watching Bill Goldberg years ago, once WWE announced they would be releasing a collection of his work, I was ecstatic. But other than the matches, there was no other dialogue. It isn't in the same format as others. For example, on the first disc, it would be extensive interviews, then disc two and three will be the discs filled with matches and other features.

Now don't get me wrong, a set with all matches is completely fine but we're talking about Goldberg who pretty much had squash matches his entire career before arriving in WWE. It would've been better just to put every single match of his infamous streak on this set. It probably would've taken as much time as the WWE work featured here.

Overall a three star set. Really, there should've been more done.",1417737600,,857,4.594771241830065

Goldberg is outstanding that he serious wrestler and proved that no one, or at least a few one could wrestler with him
like Undertaker, The Animal, and I think there must still a chance that he would back in WWE as a dream matches still

5835374,1,B00DNF1R74,"Matches are good.
However one thing that is frustrating about the wCw DVD's that the WWE brings out, is for whatever reason, the WWE always edits out most the crowd noise, making the crowd atmosphere seem quite dull during the matches.  This includes this Goldberg DVD.  Whereas if you watch those same matches on youtube, you'll see that the crowd was LOUD and really into it.  Probably the WWE doesn't want it's newer fans to see just how much better the old wCw shows was, and how much more their crowd were into it, than the WWE's fans are into the current WWE product.  They even edit out Goldberg's old (and better) entrance music, and edit in his WWE theme aswell as the ring announcer.
Glad I got this DVD, because it made me realize that it's not worth buying any wCw's DVD anymore, as the matches are completely edited, from the complete lowering of the crowd noise, to the entrance music, to the ring announcers.
This type of editing has also happened on the nWo DVD and other wCw DVD's that the WWE has brought out.

People are better off simply watching his matches on youtube.  Do not buy.",1406592000,,1103,4.49
5835375,5,B00DNF1R74,Best WWE wrestling dvd ever meant for any real Goldberg fan. Huge disappointment how he was marketed in WWE but his impact still lives on nonetheless.

5835380,4,B00DNF1R74,"This Goldberg dvd is good but not great, the match selection is perfect they could not have done it any better, however the problem is there is no interviews in between the matches, what they should have done is use the interview from the Rise & Fall of WCW and put that interview in between the matches, just like the Legacy of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H The King of Kings, & Warrior The Ultimate Collection DVDs, so you can pick it up, but keep in mind that there is no interviews on this dvd!",1403049600,,502,4.239583333333333
5835381,4,B00DNF1R74,"This is a pretty solid set. Goldberg was never my favorite, but his place in wrestling history is pivotal and he had some good matches when put in there with guys that could help him along. I won't go match by match, because my review is more or less the same for everything (Goldberg was super athletic and did his part, someone else helped him to a really solid showing, and/or it was a big moment in wrestling), but here are some pros and cons if you are thinking of getting this.

Pros
- Lots of matches and not a ton of fluff
- A lot of good WCW stuff, which is always nice to see
- Price dropped to a reasonable place pretty quickly
- You more or less get a feel for the best parts of a short, but crucial career in wrestling. There isn't a lot left on the table like when they do first sets for guys with longer careers like Savage or Hart.

Cons
- A little heavy on the WWE stuff. He didn't do his best work there. This is predictable, but still eye-roll worthy
- No commentary or interviews with Goldberg. I don't want much, but having him talk a bit about some of the key moments might be nice. It may be a blessing in disguise though, whenever I hear him talk about wrestling he seems REALLY removed from business and really disinterested in anything but his own characters ability to make money. There just isn't much depth or complexity to his take on wrestling. But, if they are only going to do this once (which I assume) they should have done it right.
- No William Regal match. Goldberg had an amazingly stiff and competitive match with William Regal on Nitro that is far and away my favorite match of his. Regal got in trouble because they wanted Goldberg to look like a killer and Regal made him work, but honestly, you come away from that match legit impressed with Goldberg's physical power and agility. I think Regal made Goldberg look amazing because he challenged him to truly show what he can do and use his natural gifts.
- Needs more of his undercard matches with good workers. Those were matches when Goldberg was doing what he did best and other guys were masterfully making him look great. For a wrestling fan, I appreciate those things. They could have nixed one or two WWE matches and put in 5-7 short nitro matches where Goldberg was really made to look unstoppable.

Bottom Line: This is worth the buy for most set collectors. Every once in a while I get in the mood to pop this in and watch a match or two.  Good Stuff.",1402531200,7,2454,4.305194805194805
5835382,4,B00DNF1R74,"Not really knowing much about Goldberg's start, or climb through the ranks when WWE was still in its infancy, it was nice to get the build-up of Goldberg's career.
One out of two streaks revered in the WWE. The only other streaks even thought of are 'title' reigns. This powerhouse of a human being basically destroyed any and all one-on-one confrontation and none could stand-up to that, not even Brock Lesnar.
Who's Next? That became his signature and trademark was w warning to any opponent Goldberg has his sights on. If he sought a challenge or retribution, Goldberg, like a few superstars we know of today, always cashes in.
Not a flashy guy, nor big on pipe-bombs. Goldberg came to do one thing and he arguably always succeeded, dominate.
Personally I hated how during the feud with Triple H that things always went south. But when it comes to the numbers game, I can see Goldberg handling two guys at once, but not three, four, or five. That's too much to ask of any superstar.

5835410,4,B00DNF1R74,"This DVD has a lot of Goldberg's matches, many of which were considered some of his best in his time with WCW and WWE and versus a lot of the top names the industry has ever created. There are other reviewers that have listed the matches so I will leave you to read those on your own.

Does it have every one of his matches that could be considered good? No. If they made a DVD on ""The Streak"" it could be a 3-4 disc special alone...but it has a lot of the ones I remember and care to watch again.

For me, having not had cable/dish during his WWE run, I will appreciate seeing his WWE matches, most of them for the first time. Watching the old WCW matches was a fun and nostalgic trip down memory lane back to the days of wrestling we will probably never see again.

Overall, the biggest selling point of this DVD is that is is a 5 star purchase if you are a Goldberg fan, based on how little there is in terms of DVDs featuring him at all anymore, let alone a collection of arguably his best matches. Given that WCW has been defunct for ages now and Goldberg was never really one of WWE's true stars, for them to do this at all is a treat for anyone who loved watching Goldberg during his WCW heyday.

Though I would have loved to have seen Goldberg talk about and reminisce a bit about his experiences back then and his run in WCW, he has been adamant about staying away from WWE and thus it doesn't surprise me they were unable to get him to sit down for something like this. Perhaps if that day ever comes and he returns to the WWE under some kind of contract, we may get another DVD with these features intact. For now, this DVD is a satisfying if imperfect collection that is basically the only one of it's kind out there right now.",1392681600,3,1739,4.136094674556213

5835412,3,B00DNF1R74,"I bought this DVD yesterday, thinking that this was the ""ultimate collection"" and I have to say I was disappointed. When you hear the words ""Goldberg"" and ""ultimate collection"" in the same sentence, you think of The Streak. 173-0. This, was not the case. This DVD is a pretty decent compilation of his better matches, but it's simply not what I nor my friends had expected. The DVD has his first two WCW matches on there, which I felt was a tease, considering after his second straight win they jump right into his WCW US Title match.

Either way though, I enjoyed watching the DVD and hopefully one day WWE will do the right thing and release his entire Streak.",1392508800,,662,4.516666666666667

Although the WCW years were covered well in 1st 2 disks, the WWE era seemed to have a lot of omissions. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the feud with Evolution. Considering Randy Orton's status in WWE now, his 1 on 1 match with Goldberg should have been included.

The loss of his title to Triple H also was omitted as well as the celebratory beer bash with Stone cold Steve Austin on Raw which I thought was a very memorable moment.

The closing Stone Cold Stunners to both Goldberg and Brock Lesnar at completion of final match at WrestleMania as also edited out. I get it may have been out of respect to Bill but was still a pivotal moment of the night.

5835476,4,B00DNF1R74,"World Championship Wrestling had different elements of their presentation that appealed to different viewers from the Nitro Girls performing to the fast paced crusierweight action to the dominance of the New World Order amongst other things as well but there was one name that started in late 1997 going all the way to early 2001 that would become the most dominate name in that company with other names & phrases being attached to him such as ""The Man"" & ""The Streak"" only for him to be resurrected in WWE for a controversial year that to this day draws mixed reactions & still has his name chanted or mentioned to this day whenever anyone begins a noticeable undefeated streak of their own...that name is Goldberg & this is a match anthology that spans his over 3 year career in WCW along with one year in WWE.  Now it should be noted that Goldberg didn't participate in this presentation (which is a story in itself for another time) so you don't hear from him or any of his past opponents or peers (and seeing how many of them have buried him in one way or another, that's a good thing) so it's pretty much a no frills match set.

Matches Include:
vs. Hugh Morrus - This was the beginning of ""The Streak"" from the end result of the match, the impressive debut performance including showcasing his power against Hugh Morris who isn't a small man himself, and the mysterious aura surrounding him to not speaking to Gene Okerland afterwords & even ""Professor"" Mike Tenay having no information on Goldberg's past during commentary.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Sept. '97

vs. The Barbarian - Goldberg's second match started out with stalemates early before Goldberg was able to take control with the body scissors takeover & second top clothesline & a powerful dropkick while also taking some punishment such as the second rope superplex but was just like the previous week where he left another impression against another big man.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Sept. '97

vs. Steve McMichael - Both men had so much heat towards each other over the events from the past two PPV's that they met in the isleway with Goldberg carrying Mongo to the ring & continued brawling both in & out of the ring with Goldberg catching Mongo coming off the top to take control with a scissored leg stretch & spear takedown before setting up a table on the outside that Mongo did go through & effected him for the rest of the match.  This wasn't much past Goldberg's first major PPV & victory over a credible name in a former U.S. Champion & Horsemen member.
WCW Starrcade '97

vs. WCW United States Champion Raven - Raven took a different approach here than usual as he went right after Goldberg attempting to block him into a corner & even throwing a dropkick before Goldberg quickly recovered tossing Raven into the outside guardrail various times before Raven attempted to use a chair & The Flock but that wouldn't stop Goldberg causing Raven to try to run away only for the fans to throw him back resulting in what went down as ""75-0.""

[Very Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 2]

WCW United States Championship Match vs. Scott Hall - Hogan laid down the gauntlet here in that Goldberg had to Hall to get his title shot against Hogan later in the night.  Hall was easily shoved down in the early moments & kept having his offense countered for Goldberg to keep taking him down only to finally get an advantage with Goldberg due to a mistimed move with Hall delivering blows to the back of the head & backdrop suplex but Goldberg was able to shrug off Hall's punches, kept taking him down with armdrags, and even blocked the Outsiders Edge on his way to jackhammering & spearing his way to his World Title shot later that night.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" July '98
[Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]

vs. WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan - Goldberg started out with a side headlock followed by powering Hogan down with moves like a shoulder block & test of strength causing Hogan to resort to tactics like using his weightbelt & a low blow then showcasing his own strength with a clothesline that took Goldberg down before taking the match to the outside using the guardrail & steel chair but Goldberg wouldn't be denied as he kept rolling out of the way when Hogan went to drop his elbows & even kicked out of his trademark moves resulting in some assistance coming out for Hogan but ultimately backfiring on him.  This was the match that many consider the apex of WCW in the ""Monday Night Wars"" as this was the match that definitely cemented Goldberg as not only the new top man in the company & his spot as a memorable name in wrestling.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" July '98
[Very Best Of WCW Monday Nitro; History Of The World Heavyweight Championship; Monday Night War]

WCW Championship Match vs. Curt Hennig - This was the first match where it wasn't just business but also personal as Curt Hennig had been calling out Goldberg for months which was showcased as he was able to run through Hennig & tossed him around in the opening seconds along with showcasing his power pressing Hennig into a powerslam causing Hennig to attempt the strategy of working over his legs giving him control including applying the Hennig-plex before he did something that you've rarely seen from Hennig's opponents.
WCW/nWo Bash At The Beach '98

WCW Championship Match vs. Sting - Dallas Page was on commentary as he was set to face the champion at Halloween Havoc as both men started off intense with Goldberg delivering a snap slam & Sting responding with a tree of woe & suplex right off the bat before they traded momentum with Sting doing a dropkick but Goldberg got right back up followed by a tombstone piledriver that he openly showed effects from causing Sting to go on the heavy offense with repeated Stinger splashes & eventually applying the Scorpion Deathlock. This was a quality ""dream match"" between both men with the only thing negative to say is what happened towards the end.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Sept. '98
[Blu-Ray version of Very Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 2]

WCW Championship Match vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This match started off very aggressive with Goldberg shoving Page into the corner with Page responding with an armdrag before both men locked up with such intensity that they ended up pushing each other to the outside as they traded momentum back & forth in the ring from DDP's leg sweep takedowns to Goldberg applying the cross armbreaker with DDP responding in a jaw breaker while Goldberg came back shoving him to the floor during an attempt at the Diamond Cutter.  DDP attempted to ground him with a front facelock only for Goldberg to use his power for various slams with DDP responding with a head scissors takedown & flying clothesline while also avoiding the spear causing Goldberg to hurt his shoulder but still fought with one arm including a slam & the spear as they continued to trade counters from the Jackhammer into the Diamond Cutter & a suplex into the Jackhammer.  This was possibly Goldberg's best match in WCW strictly from an in-ring wrestling standpoint as DDP brought out a more physical side of Goldberg in the ring than anyone before him to the point where this match was named Match Of The Year by WCW Magazine that year.
WCW/nWo Halloween Havoc '98
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

WCW Championship Match vs. Giant - This was a very quick encounter that served the purpose of him taking the best that Giant could throw at him before showcasing his dominance against a man bigger than himself going into his Starrcade match as the aftermath was more relevant here in not only the showdown with Nash but also someone else who made it clear that they wanted Goldberg.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Nov. '98

WCW Championship/No Disqualification Match vs. Kevin Nash - Goldberg's streak was at 173-0 going into this match with both men taking & countering each others offense causing them to go outside of their comfort zones like going for submissions with Goldberg's anklelock & Nash's cross armbreaker before the hits got more impactful like a punch that knocked Nash down, Nash powering Goldberg down with a clothesline, Goldberg with a spinning neckbreaker & later spinning dropkick along with a snap slam, and even Nash using the low blow. For two guys who have been know to be very limited in the ring, they gave a good ""big man"" power match with the only negative being the chaotic ending...which is typical of the nWo.
Starrcade '98
[nWo: The Revolution; Starrcade: The Essential Collection; nWo: Back In Black]

vs. Ric Flair - Hollywood Hogan & Kevin Nash was on commentary for this match as Flair kept trying to get some offense in against Goldberg to no avail as he was literally ""running into a brick wall"" & constantly being overpowered resulting in Flair resorting to using dirty tactics often from going to the eyes to going low & using the ring environment around him to his advantage.  This was a different type of match for Goldberg as he faced Flair who resorted to his ways of being ""dirtiest player in the game"" that he never encountered before.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Mar. '99

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Hollywood Hogan vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was the main event of the first ""new"" Nitro that was complete with a fresh new look & WCW logo while Kevin Nash was also on commentary for this match as it was under Fatal Four Way rules where all four men were legal at the same time under no disqualification & no count out rules resulting in different scenarios throughout the match such as each man interacting with the other 3 participants at one point, two separate matches going on at one time with one inside the ring & the other outside of the ring from the isleway to the announce table, and the constant attempts to breaking & steal pins.  This was a fun match.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Apr. '99

vs. Kevin Nash - The rematch from Starrcade here with starting out in control with his knee drives & boot in the corner before Ms. Elizabeth caused a distraction allowing Nash to use dirty tactics as well as whipping him in the corners & dropping weight across his neck but Goldberg was able to to take Nash down with a shoulderblock followed by more power moves such as the takeover suplex before a mistiming by Goldberg allowed Nash to get assistance from Lex Luger & a steel chair causing Goldberg to use ""low"" tactics of his own going against both men.  This wasn't the quality of the Starrcade match more than it was about Goldberg's revenge against the men who helped screw him out of his championship.
WCW Spring Stampede '99

vs. Diamond Dallas Page - A rematch from their Halloween Havoc match a year earlier except under different circumstances as DDP was no longer a fan favorite & used cheating tactics more often as seen by the referee finding various weapons on DDP before the match began as Goldberg kept overpowering DDP down & out of the ring briefly brawling on the outside before he was able to shrug off the Diamond Cutter into a snap powerslam causing DDP to resort to dirty tactics on Goldberg's throat & eyes while also using an object behind the referee's back attempting to keep him grounded with moves like the DDT & Goldberg's own spear.  They had a completely different match than their Havoc match but still good for the story they were telling.
WCW Fall Brawl Sept. '99

vs. WCW United States Champion Sid Vicious - Sid Vicious was undefeated in WCW since his return months earlier just like how Goldberg was in WCW, minus his Starrcade loss, leading to this battle of who would be the ""Millennium Man"" of WCW with the fight starting earlier in the night with Goldberg busting Sid open backstage while Scott Hall & Kevin Nash would jump Goldberg in the isleway during his entrance.  Both men started brawling on the outside with Sid once again being busted open due to Goldberg using the steps & punches directly to the head with Sid fighting back taking Goldberg down with a big boot & keeping him down with the camel clutch only for Goldberg to power out & continue to pound on the cut as Sid started to show the effects of the blood loss by constantly getting knocked down only to get right back up & fight back before it got to the point where he couldn't even stand.  This was one of those matches that played out well with the story they were telling in regards to Sid fighting until he couldn't anymore but it also made this match disappointing quality wise because it was build up as two monsters clashing which he didn't really get.
WCW Halloween Havoc '99

vs. Sting - Just a couple of notes here but Sting was originally suppose to defend his WCW Championship against Hulk Hogan earlier in the night only for Hogan to lay down & lose without a fight causing Sting to issue an open challenge for later which Goldberg accepted due to his controversial win earlier in the night & despite the confusion by the announcers throughout his entire match, this was a non-title match in regards to either man's title.  Goldberg came out beating on Sting with punches while tossing him into the guardrail & bouncing his head on the announce table before Sting was able to take advantage of Goldberg missing the spear with various splashes in the corner & off the top rope along with hitting Goldberg with his own spear.  This match wasn't much as it was less than 5 minutes but good for what it was.
WCW Halloween Havoc '99

""I Quit"" Match vs. Sid Vicious - Both men started out trading fist taking the brawl to the outside before Sid was able to get an advantage in the ring working over Goldberg's throat with rope choke & chokeslams before Goldberg was able to counter with the cross armbreaker & short clotheslines while pounding him in the corner & going for the cobra clutch submission.  While this was more of an actual match than their previous encounter, it was too short & ended before it really had the chance to get started.
WCW Mayhem '99

No Disqualification Match vs. Scott Steiner - Steiner came into this match wearing a face mask due to an injury weeks earlier with Goldberg starting off showcasing his power taking down Steiner with shoulderblocks & gorilla press into a powerslam before Steiner took back control with his own powerful clothesline taking Goldberg down as both men traded momentum with both men delievering suplexes with Goldberg delievering ground & pound strikes while Steiner delivered a cutter of his own.  Goldberg continued to showcase his power such as Goldberg powering out of a piledriver into an over the shoulder powerslam while Steiner resorted to other tactics taking advantage of the No DQ stipulation using the steel chair & ringside steps & table to his advantage along with his trademark pipe along with Madajah & Vince Russo getting involved with his baseball bat.  This started out as WCW's version of ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" in it being two powerhouses facing off one on one but turned into ""Goldberg vs. The World"" as he had to not only fight off Steiner but also outside distractions & every weapon they could get their hands on.
WCW Fall Brawl '00

vs. Kronik - Goldberg had a bounty put on his head with Kronik coming collect in his match where Goldberg had to defeat both members of the team to win the match while Goldberg came into the match only being medically cleared moments earlier due to a head injury he suffered earlier in the week.  Kronik resorted to double teaming both in & out of the ring focusing on the head with moves like the DDT & chokeslam while Goldberg attempted to divide & conquer knocking one to the outside while taking care of the other using his spear & objects brought into the ring like a table in a match that was pretty short & sweet.
WCW Halloween Havoc '00

No Disqualification Match w/Dewayne Bruce vs. Totally Buff - It was around this time that Goldberg had to top his previous undefeated streak to gain a World Title match or else he would be fired after his first loss leading up to this match where Lex Luger was determined to end the streak & had Buff Bagwell as his partner against Goldberg & the main who trained him at the WCW Power Plant (and more infamous for Batista's comments about him) in Dewayne ""Sarge"" Bruce (a.k.a. Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker) who was coming into the match with his arm in a cast.  This was your basic tag team match as Goldberg was very dominate leading to Totally Buff singling out Bruce & heavily working over Sarge with double teaming & keeping him down while also trying to take advantage of the No DQ stipulation with a chair along with something else that Goldberg didn't see coming...literally.
WCW Sin '01

vs. The Rock - Goldberg's WWE in-ring debut here started with dueling chants from the crowd as Rock kept getting knocked out of the ring before both Rock & Goldberg tried to show up each other here as Goldberg gave a Rock Bottom while Rock delivered a spear. Rock also resorted to dirty tactics to gain control & took advantage of Goldberg's spear being miscalculated resulting in him fight with only one arm while the crowd began to turn on him as time went on. This was as good as Rock was his usual entertaining self while you got as much as you could from Goldberg.
Backlash '03
[Top 50 Finishing Moves]

Steel Cage Match vs. Christian - Christian came into this match with the chair that had previously been used by The Rock against Goldberg & used it in an attempt to keep him down while Goldberg used the cage to punish him throughout the match to the point where Christian was busted open.  This match only served the purpose to show the aggressive side of Goldberg as a result of everything Christian had put him through for weeks.
""RAW"" May '03

vs. Chris Jericho - The confrontations between them had only occurred over the previous weeks but the tension between these two dated back to WCW 5 years earlier as Jericho kept trying to hit & move against Goldberg only to keep getting caught & overpowered to the point where Jericho attempted to use the referee as a shield before he was able to take advantage of the Goldberg's mistiming attacking the hurt shoulder with wrestling moves like armbar takedowns or using the environment around him along with other tactics such as various dropkicks from different positions & a Lionsault that landed him on Goldberg's head to the point where it hurt himself to deliver the spear later on.  Jericho did all he could here with Goldberg's limited ability to the point where the crowd saw it & kept cheering him despite all of the heel tactics that he did throughout the match.
Badd Blood '03

Elimination Chamber Match vs. World Champion Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Kevin Nash vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho - This was suppose to be Goldberg vs. Triple H however Triple H suffered a groaning injury so it was turned into a Chamber match. This was a match that had multiple stories being told such as Randy Orton protecting Triple H's championship, Kevin Nash going for revenge against Chris Jericho for his recent haircut, Shawn Michaels ultimately showing his best friend Nash that it's every man for himself, Nash doing heavy damage before walking out of what would be his last WWE match, and Goldberg being a dominate monster such as taking Chris Jericho through one of the pods. This was one of those matches where you have to understand the story they're telling as Goldberg just wasn't getting over as hoped in WWE (weather that's WWE's creative or Goldberg's own fault is another debate for another time) so this was booked to have Goldberg return to his old WCW dominate monster character to get him over...again, a match where you have to understand what they're doing to value it.
SummerSlam '03
[Satan's Prison: Elimination Chamber Anthology]

vs. World Champion Triple H - ""Title vs. Career"" was the tagline here in that Goldberg had to win the World Championship or else he would retire while Triple H lost his champions' advantage as he could lose the title by disqualification or countout.  Goldberg started out in control with high impact offense such as a press slam & high backbody drop & twisting front facelock before Triple H was able to block the spear with a high knee & focused on taking out Goldberg's legs with a chop block & figure four as both men traded momentum & continued to use whatever they could to their advantage such as Goldberg using the steel steps to make him bleed while Triple H used dirty tactics like a low blow & his trademark sledgehammer resulting in what was a competitive match between both men.
Unforgiven '03

vs. Mark Henry - This was a rare time in WWE that Goldberg met someone who could match & maybe even surpass him when it comes to strength alone as Henry was very dominate here overpowering him with slams & body presses as Goldberg couldn't knock him down or slam him & even blocked an attempt at the jackhammer causing Goldberg to attempt to use a different strategy taking down Henry & going for a submission before finally being able to match power for power but the bigger story here wasn't the fact that Goldberg was finally able to use the spear but who was the unexpected person to be on the receiving end of it.
""RAW"" Oct. '03

vs. Batista - This was pretty short & sweet as it was all about Batista softening up Goldberg for Triple H at Survivor Series as he heavily worked over the ankle he injured weeks earlier using whatever parts of the ring as Goldberg already came to the ring limping but took such as beating that he had to use the ring ropes to hold himself up.
""RAW"" Nov. '03

World Championship Match vs. Triple H - Goldberg came into this match with his lower leg & ankle heavily taped as a result of the bounty put out on him but was able to catch Triple H with a spear & knocked Ric Flair out of the ring before the match started as he continued to bring the fight throwing Triple H into the steps multiple times & dropping him on the barricade before he started to feel the effects of his injured ankle leaving an opening for Triple H to take advantage such as a chairshot to the ankle along with various strikes & stretches while Flair would attack whenever the referee wasn't looking taking away Goldberg's power advantage as he couldn't handle the pressure on his ankle as Triple H would continue to use whatever he could such as weapons & his own Evolution teammates only for Goldberg to use it all against him.  This wasn't as competitive as their previous Unforgiven match but told a better story here as far as focusing on Goldberg's ankle.
Survivor Series '03

w/Special Referee Steve Austin vs. Brock Lesnar - This was one of the most unique matches in not only WrestleMania history but in the history of the company as I believe this is the first time that both wrestlers were leaving the company after the match. With the news leaking just a few weeks prior, the NYC crowd let them have it non-stop with the chants of ""You Sold Out"" while also singing ""Hey, Hey, Hey...GOODBYE!"" along with Austin getting the most cheers to the point where he had to smurk at that. Both men kept having stalemates & stalling for around the first 5 minutes which only had the crowd chanting even more like ""This Match Sucks!"" Both men were able to hit their trademark finishers only to kick out & question Austin about the count before the eventual finish but this would have gone down as one of the most disappointing matches in history as it didn't live up to the hype & neither man really giving a strong showing on the way out.
As a side note, they didn't show the aftermath between not only Austin & Lesnar but Austin & Goldberg as well.
WrestleMania XX
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain - Collectors Edition]

(Blu-Ray) nWo Battle Royal vs. Kevin Nash vs. Sting vs. Konnan vs. Lex Luger vs. Curt Hennig vs. Giant vs. Scott Hall vs. Scott Norton - Members of both nWo factions (Hollywood & Wolfpack) were set to face off against each other here but Goldberg entered himself into the match as well with elimination not only happening by going over the top rope but pinfall or submission as well with Goldberg's having very smart strategy for his first ever battle royal by picking his spots to get involved in the action while also staying in corners & letting others come to him as this match wasn't much past the star power involved & the stories of Kevin Nash being focused directly on Scott Hall while Goldberg was targeting Giant.
WCW Road Wild '98

(Blu-Ray) vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This grudge match was built up for over 3 months and started off heavy as Goldberg scooped slammed Bigelow early. Bigelow tried to work over Goldberg's lower body by doing elbow drops to the groin & working over his knees with a modified step over toehold using his weight to his advantage. Bigelow also took to the air with his diving headbutt only to be caught the second time as Goldberg shoved him off when attempting to do a moonsault leading to Goldberg's spear TWICE & jackhammer for the victory. This match showcased by Bam Bam Bigelow was definitely one of the best big men in the business because he got more of a match out of Goldberg here than most others were able to do before him.
SuperBrawl IX

(Blu-Ray) vs. Sting - This was one of those ""put a storyline over matches"" as it was setup to be a rematch from Halloween Havoc weeks earlier but the real focus here was the appearance of Lex Luger & Elizabeth in an attempt to ""try to make things right"" with Sting as this match lasted a little more than 5 minutes but the entrances were longer than the match itself.
""WCW Nitro"" Nov. '99

(Blu-Ray) No Disqualification Match vs. WCW Champion Bret Hart - Goldberg had the advantage early overpowering Bret time & time again such as reversing his side headlock take down into a gorilla press slam & blocking the irish whip into a clothesline causing Bret to resort to other tactics outside of his traditional wrestling such as sending Goldberg into the railing on the outside only for Goldberg to give it right back sending Bret into the announce table & guardrail as they traded momentum with Goldberg continuing to use his power for moves like a suplex takeover while Bret took advantage of a mistimed spear to work over the legs with the figure four both in the ring & around the ringpost with the action getting so intense that referees were getting knocked out within minutes causing a special referee to come out & make the final call that just left everyone very confused.  This match is notorious as the one that ended Bret's career due to the unprotected mule kick to his head causing the concussion he was never able to completely recover from along with the confusing finish that would eventually lead to the infamous rematch the next night resulting in ""the band getting back together"" but if you can get get past all of that, it was a good match between two men with very conflicting wrestling styles.
Starrcade '99

(Blu-Ray) World Championship Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Goldberg didn't come into this match 100% as he was attacked earlier by Mark Henry but took the early advantage constantly shoving Shawn down resulting in him using a tactic to try to get a mental edge over Goldberg as they went back & forth with Goldberg using his power for impact with various press slams & strikes while HBK used his finesse trying to take the legs out from Goldberg & later going aerial but the bigger story here was about Triple H's bounty on Goldberg being cashed in.
""RAW"" Oct. '03

The biggest knock on Goldberg as far as what we saw in front of the camera was that he's always been the modern day Ultimate Warrior in that he's a one dimensional power wrestler who would rarely go out of the wrestling style while it's also no big secret that he was heavily protected in WCW by ""The Streak"" & wrestlers working around him to make him look & stay ""protected"" while he didn't have that luxury in WWE so if your expecting more than that then your looking at the wrong guy.  Now saying that, there are a few faults on this DVD set as some of the match selections could have easily been replaced by another match that would have still gotten the same point but better quality (Barbarian & Batista & the Sting match from Nitro on the Blu-Ray in exchange for the Sting match between the two at Slamboree earlier that year & I would have put the infamous William Regal match or the triple threat with Kane & Triple H on the Blu-Ray as well) but one big positive is the crap (and I'm putting that lightly) from the Vince Russo era of WCW involving Goldberg was kept to a minimum.  In the end, if you were a big fan of WCW during the Monday Night Wars or just a fan of Goldberg period then it's a no brainer to get this set.",1382918400,4,28691,4.5787217459080285
5835477,4,B00DNF1R74,"Bill Goldberg was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time !
Why ? Because under fair conditions he never ever lost a match ! Who else can make such a claim in wrestling ?
The only time he was ever defeated was when his opponents resorted to  cheating in order to bring the great man down - gutless cowards like Kevin Nash, Rick Steiner, Bagwell/Luger and the ridiculous Triple H - not one of these pathetic losers could beat Goldberg in a fair fight and so had to bring in additional lackeys to help them finish the job. How sad is that !
Only the brilliant Sting ever came close to beating Goldberg fair and square - if Hogan hadn't interfered who know what would've happened ?
Saying that Goldberg simply did the same thing over and over has got to be one of the stupidist comments ever made !
You could make the same arguement against any other wrestler - The Rock comes in and mouths off, Hogan rips his shirt, Stone Cold guzzles his beer cans, Triple H cheats !
Nearly all of Goldberg's key match's are here including his defeat of The Rock - try finding that match in the endless 'Rock' boxsets that are out there. The Great One doesn't like being reminded of that painful loss !
Bottom line is that Bill Goldberg was the real deal - he came in, did the job and always fought clean - everything a genuine wrestler should be !
This collection truly honours the man by letting all of his match's speak for themselves.
Of that Goldberg himself would approve.",1382659200,,1463,4.358974358974359

1-vs  the hitman in a NO DQ  match.
2- vs booker T
3- VS  raven. when he was still winning his  streak. not the title match.
4- vs scott steiner, not the no DQ  match.
I mean, he only lost like 7 times. you might as well show them.
5-the 3 story cage match.
6- clips from the royal rumbles he was in where he fought multiple  attackers by himself and won.
7-vs brock lesnar at WM.
8-THE FIGHT  he got into vs stone cold.
I could go on and on. I really don't see why they make these videos if they are going to only put in half the effort. the DVD DOES  look good, just not as awesome as they could have and should have made it. the fans want more !
so i'd say buy it. the matches are listed in other reviews. just don't expect it to be all it could.",1382140800,,891,3.9329608938547485
5835490,4,B00DNF1R74,"the good: no documentary and they were smart not to put Goldberg's WCW heel turn on this (trust me, these are good things).
the bad: Goldberg's WWE run. If the people at WWE were smart they would have had this as WWE champion for a lot longer than 2 months.

 If you are a fan of wrestling, wished the Monday night war was still going strong, and wished WCW never went out of business, this is a buy now.",1381708800,,404,4.10126582278481

Goldberg was a raw phenomena much like stone cold where his presence and direct approach to wrestling brought legitimacy (appearance wise) to wrestling.",1381449600,,221,5.166666666666667
5835492,3,B00DNF1R74,"I've been a wrestling fan for a very long time. I don't often post reviews, but I do only when I feel I must. This is one of those times, especially since this involves one of the best athletes to ever step foot into that ring. GOLDBERG! We all remember that chant that went along with his entrance, almost like summoning a gladiator to the arena as he made his way from the back to the stage, only to stand in the fire every time and scare the living piss out of each opponent.
WWE did what you could say, an okay job with this. But only okay.

The matches they selected are pretty decent, however there were plenty of Nitro taping's where he had much better matches than what you see on this disc, however, I think they saved that for the ""Best of Nitro"" disc. It includes his first and second matches ever in the WCW and has a few pretty awesome matches such as Sting, DDP (Which were the best ever) and a few good matches he had in WWE (The Elimination Chamber match was probably the only highlight during that stint). I'm glad they chose NOT to have the stupid Vince Russo angle in this disc, and kept it about his best matches (or at least what WWE considers his best)

There is a commentator ranting about certain areas of his career on this, as well as it showing some pretty good highlight reels during those dubs, that have not been seen in years! Just wish those matches were on here!!!

~~~~~~But here are my true issues with this release~~~~~~

First, I'd like to let everyone know that I waited years for something Goldberg related to come out after he left WWE. When I first heard this was coming out, I let all my wrestling buddies know! Now, I'm not so sure any of that was a good idea. Worth the wait? Just read and find out for yourself.

1. The cover. Terrible cover choice. For one, its a WWE photo when it should have been a WCW picture they used instead. I think the best photo they could have used is him standing in the sparks at the stage during his entrance with the WCW Heavyweight belt on. (which always looked best on him!) Instead they just took a random generic photo of him standing in the corner of the ring about to spear the living hell out of HHH? I think.

It only gets worse from here, so be prepared. If you have not bought this yet, and you were around back in the day to watch this stuff on TV, then you will be very disappointed by the next few things I say.

2. They used the Jim Johnston version of his music from his WWE days, in ALL of the WCW footage. Its all be HEAVILY edited to exclude the original theme ""Invasion"" by Christian Poulet. Its a huge upset because there is something about that original theme that was just much better than Jim's version. Dont get me wrong, Jim Johnston has made some of the best themes of all time, and his rendition of ""Invasion"" was good for what it was, but it was NOT the theme the fans remember best. But it doesn't stop there with the heavy editing. Because of the new dub on the audio track that the editors had to do, they took out all the original camera audio as well. The camera's that would be up close in Bill's face would pick up all his explosive screams as he did his punch kick combos in succession with the pyro. So now, all you see is him ""screaming"" but you don't hear anything. Just that annoying Jim version of ""Invasion"". My best guess is that WWE does not own the rights to the original ""Invasion"" and didn't want to pay up a very small licensing fee to use it in this release. Its a shame because licensing fees are usually not that expensive, especially for a $2billion dollar company. The fans (*myself and many others) would have appreciated this, but they instead coped out, like usual.

3. Michael Buffer has been removed from all entrance announcements. This was a signature WCW thing that they did with big matches. I have no idea why they did this. He has a great relationship with WWE and has even worked for them. Yet they removed ALL of his dubs. WTH WWE?!

4. Pyro used to be super loud and full of bass, now it sounds like a silly firecracker. I remember watching the DDP vs. Goldberg match at Halloween Havoc 1998 on ppv. I even have seen the same video on YouTube, so I know I'm not getting old or crazy. But I remember almost all of his entrances with the sparks had a deep **BOOM** that went along with them as they turned on. Yet again, WWE felt the need to edit the hell out of this as well! This is just ridiculous and really angers the piss out of me. There was no reason to do this and it takes away from that experience of watching Goldberg do his thing on that stage. So now all you will hear when you watch this is a tiny little *spak* sound as they turn on. The rest of the pyro is also very loud and boomy, but they just turned that down by about 98% I don't get it, and it really was not necessary. Nobody is going to go blowing their sound system over this, in fact, thats the part when I would have turned it WAY up!

5. The most important reason I gave this 3 stars here on Amazon is one thing. They didn't actually get Goldberg to do any type of interview for this. They didn't even use archival footage from the WCW days. I just bought the HHH ""Thy Kingdom Come"" last week and they just sit him down on a sofa, probably at his house and literally squeeze info out of him. But they couldn't get Goldberg for 1 hour to do a little interview for this release. They guy is pretty made as far as money goes, and he surely loves his fans. He more than likely would have done this for little pay, or even free! That would have sent this over the top and the rest of the fatal flaws in this disc probably wouldn't have mattered that much. But again, they chose the cheap and easy way out of this release. Shame... a real shame.

Goldberg was the best thing that happened to WCW, and he even managed to kick ass in a super competitive WWE. The fans still chant his name to this day. Yet WWE took the cheap and easy route and made this nearly painful to watch, for someone that was, and still is as big as Goldberg. They don't cheap out on their 'superstars' such as Rock, Stone Cold, and HHH. But they cheap out real quick when its a WCW guy. Even to as far as make his entrance less cool. Shame on you WWE. This will be my last purchase from them for quite some time for sure.",1381363200,45,6309,4.184362139917695
5835493,4,B00DNF1R74,"The only reason it's not 5 stars is because Goldberg had nothing to do with the making of this collection. Also it is just that... a collection! I had already preordered it before they even revealed the cover art (that's how big of a Goldberg fan that I am). The best part of WWE DVDs/Blu-Rays is the commentary and explanations from those involved in the matches and time period. However, since this is a GOLDBER collection. The matches do a lot of the talking and still keep you enthralled as if you are reliving it. Fantastic collection for any old wrestling fan, and especially relavent to younger fans who need to know what it was like when wrestling WAS the BEST SPORT AROUND",1381363200,,681,4.544715447154472
5835494,4,B00DNF1R74,"I have to say...I am so happy that this dvd/blu ray was released. I have waited years for this.

Now. I have seem some negative thoughts on this dvd/blu ray, but let me give my thoughts on this piece.

When goldberg first came to wcw in 1997, he was interesting. He was quiet. He was powerful. He would come out and win matches in under 3 min, and leave the ring.

This dvd/blu ray captures that. It starts from his first match, to his last match.

I would have given this release a 5 star, but it did not have any Goldberg commentary. Just his best matches back to back. But that was ok for me.

Goldberg was special, and popular for the time.

Before Wrestlemania 18 and the passing of the torch from Hogan to the Rock, the real passing of the torch was from Hogan to Goldberg on WCW Nitro for the WCW Championship which is on here.

He was the Ric Flair of the 90's for WCW, as Steve Austin was the Hogan of the 90's for WWE. The dream match at the time would have been Goldberg vs. Austin. (Till WCW f'ed it up had had Goldberg lose at Starrcade.)

It was sad what WWE did to him when he came to wrestle for them.

This is a nice list of all of Goldberg's matches.",1381276800,,1168,4.065502183406114

5835496,5,B00DNF1R74,"Goldberg made me start watching wrestling in 98. I had watched when I was a kid and eventually stopped because it was just not realistic. Until a friend at work back in 98 said you have to tune in and see Goldberg! I did and was hooked, his intensity, entrance, strength and his fighting techniques he exhibited during matches made you stop to ask yourself ""did he just run that guy over with that spear for real?""
I also got to meet him in Miami for a book signing of his book titled Who's Next?, it was great to meet him! It is about time a DVD of Goldberg is available. I always wanted to have one for my collection! Maybe we will see him in action in WWE again, he can still do everything at 47 years old! Atleast we have him in WWE2k14 & on Blue Ray, another run would be awesome! If anyone should end Takers' streak it should be Goldberg!

In total there are 35 matches on this Blue-Ray and all are worth the 10$ I paid for the wonderful memories of WCW. The only negative is I wish Goldberg would have been involved more for interviews and match re-cap thoughts like on Stone Cold and Shawn Michaels DVD sets. But overall this Blue-Ray is worth the money and recommend to all WCW fans.",1503360000,,1158,4.2207207207207205
