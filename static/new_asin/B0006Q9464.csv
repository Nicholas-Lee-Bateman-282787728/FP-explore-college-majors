2192086,4,B0006Q9464,"Koreans have been big players in the Asian horror boom of the last few years, producing acclaimed genre fare such as ""Ring Virus"", ""A tale of two sisters"" and the sadistic revenge thriller ""Oldboy"" among others.  One of the more successful was the 2002 Korean box office smash ""Phone"" just now released in America through TLA Entertainment Group.  No doubt ""Phone"" owes part of its success to the splash that Ringu made on the international horror scene.  However, knocking off ""Phone"" as a Ringu ripoff would be a mistake.  This is an excellent film in its own right.

Ji-Won, a successful journalist, is being stalked.  Her revealing sex-scandal articles have made her quite a few enemies lately including a creep who keeps phoning her cell and following her around so she changes her phone number and accepts her friend's offer of a retreat into a secluded country cabin.  But even with new digs and a new phone number, Ji-Won is still getting creepy calls.  Even worse, she finds out that the last 3 people who were registered under the same phone# have died mysterious deaths...

""Phone"" wastes no time getting started.  The initial elevator scene is a real chiller as are the initial stalker calls that Ji-Won receives.  Barely 20 minutes into it and this one is a full-blown creepfest.  The incessant ringing is a clever way to scare the viewer; the first few had me on edge but after a half dozen rings and a bunch of Red Herrings later my nerves were pretty well fried.  At this point, however effective it may be in scaring us, ""Phone"" does feel derivative of Ringu.  But halfway through the movie the plot takes a very interesting turn of events, involving a complex backstory of the events surrounding the birth of creepy kid Yeong-ju and a hidden affair between one of the main characters and a schoolgirl who may or may not be a vengeful ghost, all the while as Ji-Won tries to uncover the mysteries surrounding the deaths of the previous owners of the same phone #. Got all that? I know ""Phone"" seems routine on the surface when you haven't seen the movie, but trust me it is anything but.

As in ""Ju-On The Grudge"" these backstories are told in a non-linear style that keeps us wondering what is a dream and what's not?  Is this in the past or in the future?  It's all rather confusing in parts but this is what makes ""Phone"" even better upon repeat viewings.  This is yet another fine addition in the cannon of mind-blowing Asian horror films to come out in recent years.  Oh, one more thing.  Why not just chuck the darn phone  or let it ring? Doesn't make much sense but then again we ARE living in the 21st century.  People have become way too attached to the ghastly things...",1107561600,11,2697,4.586638830897703
2192087,4,B0006Q9464,"~
Boy, the possibilities are almost endless with the number of catchy 'review headings' anyone can come up with -- both in favor of AND in disrespect to this movie. Based upon what I had read from others who had seen this film prior to its availability in DVD NTSC-1 encoding, I had originally planned to title my review as:

""The tele-'PHONE' is 'RING'-ing!""

-- or something to that effect, because one of the things most commonly heard about this movie was that it was basically another twist on Nakata Hideo's ""RING"" (which now seems to be becoming the new 'standard' by which ALL new Asian horror is to compared -- much like Sean Connery's ""James Bond"" being the ""OO7"" all subsequent assumers of the role are to be judged against, I suppose). I had to cancel the idea for such a title heading, however, once I had actually sat through the movie for the first time.

Without a doubt, there are a number of things reminiscent of ""RING"" -- most notably the 'vengeful spirit lashing out via some modern-day electronic device' (in this case, a cellular phone) and a female reporter associated with it intent on tracking the cursed technology back to its source (though not initially intended in this case, her actions instead being in response to a series of bizarre events; whereas the reporter in ""RING"" was investigating the legend of the 'cursed video' from the very beginning as part of her story).

A reporter named Ji-won, who exposes a ring of criminal activity of the worst kind, receives threatening calls from one of the perpetrators who got rounded up in the police sweep resulted from her expose. Though the harassing calls are coming from someone who makes it more than clear that she is being stalked, the reporter makes the unwise assumption that if she simply changes the number on her cell phone the angry party will eventually have to give up on trying to keep her in a state of fear and panic (she's led to believe that the danger is not real, and that the threats are only part of a psychological manipulation the criminal is playing). When she applies for the new number, only one particular number keeps appearing on the computer screen as being available. Time being precious as it is, she decides not to nit-pick over it and takes the number the computer glitch keeps coughing up.

Things then go from bad to worse, as she begins receiving a new set of calls on the new number. This has a very negative affect on little Yeong-Ju, the reporter's ""niece,"" who happened to be the very first person to answer the phone when it rang on the new number. As a result of what she heard on the other end of the line, the little girl experiences psychological trauma and undergoes some very disturbed & disturbing behaviors, which often expresses itself as fits of rage -- especially whenever her father becomes intimate with his wife. Psychological examinations show nothing to be too concerned about, suggesting that it is just a passing phase -- but as Yeong-Ju's behavior becomes more destructive (both self-destructive as well as projected outward) and more violent, her ""auntie"" uses her investigative skills as a reporter to track down the history of the phone number she adopted in order to determine what sort of connection it may have for the strange effect upon the little girl's mind. The answers she finds are not pretty, as everything comes full circle.

One of the things which bothered me at first, but then grew on me favorably, was the number of ""false climaxes."" Typically most people become annoyed by this sort of manipulation, but once this movie reveals its final secrets, you should wind up appreciating the beauty and mastery in the way each layer was pulled back and each new revelation led to the moment of ""orgasmic release,"" if you will.

Sure, there are those cliches which now come standard in your typical Asian ghost story fare. But, suffice it to say, although this movie is no ""RING,"" it is also no ""RING.""

P.S. -
You'll just adore (in an uneasy sort of way) the little girl who plays Yeong-Ju. You'll really feel for her even as you're being totally freaked-&-creeped by her. Wedding bells for Yeong-Ju and Toshio are surely in the making :)",1107475200,12,4192,4.701634877384196

Phone foregoes all those pesky elements like a plot that makes sense, employing instead a lot of beautifully cropped images, brazen colors, and looks askance (meant to portent ill will from the nether region).  The story is suspiciously simple, involving a killer phone number, a peeved ghost, Moonlight Sonata, and a married man with roving intentions.  It's just the way in which it was presented that makes it a bit off.  It's as if the filmmaker wrote the screenplay on index cards then threw them in the air.  How and where they landed was the order in which it was filmed.

2192133,5,B0006Q9464,"I should preface this review by saying that I'm not normally a horror fan, and haven't seen many other Asian horror movies. I bought this mainly because I'm a big fan of Ha Ji Won.

I found ""Phone"" to be haunting and suspenseful. Despite the title, this is a film that uses mostly low-tech effects for its thrills: atmospheric lighting/shadows, a quiet, creepy score, and of course, the reactions on the faces of the actors. There are solid performances from the mostly female cast, especially Ha Ji Won as the young journalist/narrator and Eun Seo-Woo as a disturbed young girl. Up until the final, climactic scene, there is not a lot of blood and gore, and there are some surprising twists at the end. After watching it the first time, I found myself going over the scenes in my head, and piecing together the clues. It's definitely worth watching again.

If you enjoy supernatural thrillers, such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others""' you will probably really like ""Phone"".

In Korean with English subtitles (which are excellent, by the way). Extras include a brief ""Making Of"" documentary and interviews with the director and cast members.",1339891200,2,1144,4.856410256410256

In the same way that RINGU made video tapes an instrument of eeevil, and PULSE turned the internet into a terrifying abyss, PHONE, like JU-ON, utilizes our cell-phone addiction to great effect. With all of these films, we get the idea that supernatural forces are using our gadgets against us. After all, how can we possibly escape these spooks if we put their conduits in our homes and even carry them around w/ us? PHONE also has one of the best portrayals of child-possession since THE EXORCIST!

2192136,4,B0006Q9464,"PHONE falls into the long line of supernatural revenge films that were released across Asia in the early 2000s. Ahn Byung-Ki draws a great deal of influence from Hideo Nakata's RINGU, while also sharing many similar elements with the WHISPERING CORRIDORS series. A young reporter begins receiving terrifying phone calls from an unknown caller, but her search for the truth leads into a dark and twisted tale of obsession and vengeance. Though the plot structure is undoubtedly familiar, PHONE still introduces an original story and a number of chilling moments. The most frightening scenes involve the young Yeong-ju, a 5yr old whose possession by the evil spirit causes her to contort her body and lash out at her mother. In addition, the powerful score and strong cinematography contribute to the mounting suspense. Asian Horror fans will find plenty to like here.

The actors are all good looking, the little girl was a good actress (except when she was doing the crazy laughter, but that's hard to do well so I'll cut her some slack.) The cinematography and sets were nice but the plot. Oh the plot. The hook about a journalist investigating sex scandals is never developed. That is left behind fairly quickly. The story that is there instead, the one that actually relates to the ""scary"" phone, is well-developed and the pacing is good, but it's a very, very common one. The ending was fine, exciting almost.
The main problem is that it is supposed to be a horror movie and it's not very frightening. You could anticipate most of the moments where they wanted you to jump.

2192169,3,B0006Q9464,"Phone (Byeong-ki Ahn, 2002)

Average Korean horror flick that contains nothing you haven't seen before, but if you're a fan of the genre and have seen most of the big names, this one should tide you over until the next major flick comes out.

Plot: an investigative journalist, Ji-won (Daddy Longlegs' Ji-won Ha), has been getting threatening calls after a series of stories she did, and so she changes her cell phone. A couple of friends, figuring she needs to get out of the city for a while, offer to let her stay at their house in the country. All well and good, but not long after Ji-won and the female half of the friends, Ho-jyung (Return's Yu-mi Kim), get set up in the house, Ji-won starts getting calls again. Ho-jyung's daughter Yung-ju (Clementine's Seo-woo Eun) answers one of them, and immediately starts screaming. Her demeanor changes after that, and Ji-won, doing what she does best, finds out that everyone who's had the number before her has died an unnatural death. How to save Yung-ju from the same fate?

It's certainly not a bad movie, it's just not all the great, either. There's little to distinguish it from the flood of Asian horror films that's come out in the past decade, and with as many of them as there are, if you do some digging you're sure to find a number that you'll end up liking better than this; still, it's worth watching if you've nothing better to do with your evening. ***",1260403200,,1417,4.592885375494071
2192170,5,B0006Q9464,"This movie is based around a cell phone.  No, not like all the other cell phone movies.  This one seems to have come from ""The Dark Side"" as the number that is linked to it was previously held by a ""missing"" woman.  This missing woman was the mistress of a prominent married man.  The phone occassionally rings and whomever answers it and listens is stricken with a sudden urge to commit deathly acts and then die.
When a friend's daughter picks up the phone and listens, she instantly starts throwing tantrums.  This leads in to the movie which portrays the current phone owner (woman) playing detective to determine why she is getting these calls, who is placing them, and ultimately to determine what crime has been committed by who.
Extremely good movie for those with a strong stomach for horror and blood.

2192172,4,B0006Q9464,"this movie is the reason i got into asian horror in the first place.  It is more of a 'suspense/psychological thriller' than anything else. it THANKfully lacks gore and slasher-film elements and relies entirely on the story to freak you out.  It would be considered more of a ghost-story than 'horror' by what I can only deem to be 'hard-core asian/j-horror officionados', as it would appear from other reviews that some people find it too tame.  I quite prefer the asian suspense thriller films in place of the gross-out slasher-flicks anyways, so this film appealed to me.  --While it does get moderately predictable at the end, it is still quite a fun journey, with exceptional acting, great film quality, and you won't be sorry you've spent some time watching it.",1240876800,,767,4.876923076923077

2192175,2,B0006Q9464,"Directed by Byeong-ki Ahn, the film ""Phone"" boasts the usual beautiful cinematography one now expects from Korean horror, thriller and suspense films. Many viewers pointed out that this film reminded them of the Japanese film ""RINGU."" However, as for myself, the film reminded me a lot of the horror films ONE MISSED CALL, and ONE MISSED CALL 2. [The former being directed by Takashi Miike]. What this film lacked, that these two other films had, in my opinion, was a good story, creepy scenes, and a lot more scare factor. This film may appeal to some viewers, as witnessed by the number of those who liked it. However, the film has a few sub-plots going along with the narrative that make this film a bit disjointed.

The film centers on a woman reporter named Ji-won (Ji-won Ha). Ji-won has just exposed a sex ring of several men with underage girls. As a result, this has put her life in jeopardy. She is constantly being harassed through her cellphone with death threats. Furthermore, she is being pursued by one of these men. Therefore, for her protection, Ji-won decides to take up an offer to stay at the Bangbae house of her friends, which is still being renovated by her friends husband, Chang-hoon (Woo-jae Choi). Her friend Ho-jeong (Yu-mi Kim) does not think that the house is suitable, and tries to dissuade Ji-won in a polite way. Yet, with the upcoming trial ahead of her, and for her protection, she takes Chang-hoon up on his offer. There is something ominous in this new house, and I do not wish to give this away.

Moreover, there is something wrong with the young daughter of her friends. Young-ju (Seo-woo Eun) answers Ji-won's cellphone while at an art exhibit, and afterwards begins exhibiting bizarre behavior. The child  becomes more attached to her father, and more distant from the mother. Why? What is the cause of this young child's behavior that has changed drastically since she listened in on the cellphone? Plus, something strange is happening in the house Ji-won is now living at. Not only does Ji-won still receive strange phone calls, but she also receives eerie pictures on her laptop computer. Determined to discover what is happening, Ji-won becomes convinced that she and the young child are in danger from a ghost. The film is predictable, and for the most part boring. If you must see the film, rent it first. I did not think this was a particularly good horror film. And what few horror scenes the viewer is witness to is not enough to salvage this film.

On the downside - I wasn't crazy about some of the cliched scenes from former Asian films, particularly from Dark Water - elevator scene and hair coming out of the faucet. Could have been a bit more creative in that aspect. The Ringu conncetion only surfaced in Ji-won's search for dead girls identity.

2192190,3,B0006Q9464,"This story wasn't told in chronological order. That works in some movies, but not this one. It just made things confusing.

A few things I disliked:

Bland Characters

First of all, there were several young, female characters who were indistinguishable from one another. They were all about the same age and nothing stood out about them. There was such such a lack of character development, (they were introduced sporadically throughout the film) and I had hard time keeping track of who was who. By the time I started to understand what was going on, the movie was half-way over.

Abandoned Story Lines

The sex scandal, the stalker, the detective--it's like they started writing one screenplay stopped then started writing another one then just spliced the two together.

I did like the latter part of the story and seeing how the husband's infidelity had actually caused the problems he was having with his young daughter and wife, but it's hard to see how this is related to all the other deaths and cell phone number being possessed. It should have been one or the other, a reporter stalked by someone she was exposing or the ghost of a schoolgirl takes revenge on the married man that dumped her. As with a lot of Japanese and Korean horror films, there were too many story lines going on to make a coherent movie.

The name of the movie is Phone, but actually, the use of phones as a scare tactic seemed out of place with everything else that was going on. (Besides the fact that this theme has been done to death.)

Definately rent this movie before buying it. It was ok, but you'll probably never want to see it again.",1157760000,3,1627,4.625

As for my commentary, this is not really a horror, but more like a mystery and dark drama involving a ghost.  It's not really scary, and I don't think it's really meant to be.  It has a very mysterious style, but the plot is what this is about.

If you thought the plot of The Ring was great, but don't need the horror aspect so much, then you will love this one.  It's a very similar style, in which a person must investigate the ghost that haunts her and the plot turns in many directions as it unfolds to gradually explain the meaning of the haunting.

2192193,4,B0006Q9464,"`Phone', by Korean director, Ahn Byong Ki, is clearly done in imitation of recent, successful Japanese films such as `Ring' and `Dark Water'. These have been so successful that Hollywood almost immediately remakes them, which always seems to loose something in the translation. On the other hand, Hollywood does seem to avoid some of the obscurities I often find in the plots and editing of these otherwise excellently styled films.

I'm embarrassed to say that one problem I often find in these Asian productions is that very often, the two main characters look so much alike that it is often hard to tell the difference between the two, especially in matters relating to the plot. This is understandable in that every time it occurs, the two characters are sisters who will understandably look alike, but in this movie, it is particularly difficult, as both characters are young adults, with virtually no sign such as age to distinguish between the two.

On the other hand, as with all these films, the cinematography, staging, and editing are simply flawless. When the movie opens, I find the simplicity of the images on the screen to be achingly beautiful as well as subtly horrifying. And, this finely measured craft is maintained throughout the film.

One thing all these movies seem to do is to master the attribute which has for so long been Stephen King's signature in turning the ordinary, such as a big dog or the common cold or a 1958 Plymouth Fury into something horrible. In this case, it's the cellphone. While the title seems to implicate all telephones, the perp in virtually every scene in the movie is the ubiquitous ultrathin! Oddly, the source of the phantom telephone calls is traced to a hard-wired telephone line.

I will probably give away nothing to detract from the pleasure of watching the movie if I revealed anything of the plot, since the details of the plot are almost irrelevant to the experience. The story moves in such a circuitous and disconnected manner that it is hard to make sense of how one gets from the initial images to the end of the movie, which seems to not really succeed in resolving the story.

One disturbing thing about the movie is that it plays the `child in peril' card, which many may find disturbing. The single most famous instance of this gambit is near the end of `Aliens', when Ripley must rescue Newt from the most horrific mama alien. I recall the chagrin with this business and am surprised to see in as many films as I do, including this one.

In spare outline, the story regards a journalist who has done a series or articles on sex scandals and who begins to get threatening telephone calls, seemingly connected with these stories. The problem for the viewer is that this story line goes nowhere and the plot switches to dealing with the spirit of a murdered young woman whose ghost invades the niece of the journalist.

As I'm writing this, pieces are starting to come together, and I have the sense that part of the problem may be in the translation from the spoken Korean to the English subtitles. Unlike for German and French, I can make absolutely no sense of the Korean, but I suspect that something may be `lost in translation'.

Since all the extras are spoken in Korean with subtitles as well, they are not quite as good as, for example, the English commentary we get on films by, for example Jean Renoir and Pierre Truffout, but they are welcome.

If you like other `Asian' horror movies, you are sure to like this one and the story line is obscure enough to require at least two or three viewings to figure everything out.",1145750400,4,3601,4.685126582278481

The married man has a young daugther already at home and tries to break up with the schoolgirl after she tells him shes pregnant.

Well.

Without giving too much away - the girl ends up out of the frame and there appears to be a 'pulse' - yes, a 'pulse' as in 'Cell' ah-hem, thats makes people crazy to hear it on their mobile and also ends in some horrific deaths for the new owners of the young girls mobile number.

2192195,4,B0006Q9464,"Like ""Double Vision"", ""Phone"" is an Asian movie that starts out in the suspense thriller vein and evolves into a tremendous horror movie.  With plenty of mystery, drama, enigmatism and genuine frights to appeal to a broad range of movie fans, ""Phone"" was a huge hit in its native South Korea and is entitled to more recognition in the world outside Asia.

  When an investigative reporter played by Ji-Won Ha begins receiving threatening cell phone calls she assumes it's related to one of the criminal exposes she's written.  But the calls, and the strange happenings with her computer, seem to suugest to the viewer, if not immediately all the characters, that the source of the threats is something stranger.  Before seeing ""Phone"" I'd heard it asked why the character doesn't simply get rid of the single phone that seems to be the main source of the threats, but upon seeing it at least that became clear: by the time it's looking more and more supernatural and less like a flesh-and-blood stalker, the 'threat' (for lack of a better word) has already got its hooks into someone close to Ha's character, and there's an unspoken reluctance to get rid of the conduit.  One of the main things that reveals the mystery to be unearthly in origin is the revelation, fairly early on, that the last several people to have the cell phone number Ji-Won now has, have died.  One in a car accident, one an apparant suicide, and so on.

  Although the question of why she didn't get rid of the title phone was cleared up, other things remain unexplained.  And not things that Should be left cryptic and open to interpretation; a couple of plot threads are simply dropped with no explanation, as if scenes were cut out of the movie.  If one wants to they can come up with ideas of their own on these fronts, but I thought the movie should have at least given some kind of hints or acknowledgement to the fact that these points were left so open.  If not for this fault, it might have gotten five stars.

  The production is superb, which seems to be the par for South Korean movies, and the acting exceptional.  See-Woo Eun, a child actress playing a little girl named Yeong-Ju, is especially excellent, on par with Dakota Fanning's performance in ""War Of The Worlds"".  Another thing worth mentioning is the 'jump' factor - if there's one thing Asian horror movies seem to have in common, it's that they certainly don't telegraph their jolts.  With American horror movies excellent the last few years, with Canada actually producing a fairly large number of greats for the first time (not that there haven't been individual horror movies done in Canada that were good before; just not so many of them), with the European output still high in quality, and with the continuing flood of greats from Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, etc. it's a great time to be a horror fan.  (Now if only somebody would licence some of those intruiging-looking horror movies from the Phillipines, Malaysia, and so on for worldwide release we'd be all set)",1140998400,,3019,4.701520912547529
2192196,3,B0006Q9464,"But they didn't.  To most extents, it was The Ring Part 18, and from Korea; same premise, same kind of sometimes-cheap shocks. And like the Ring, the plot was interesting, if done to death.  But it was done to death in an interesting way; a way we haven't seen before, not exactly, and if they would have focused more on that and less on trying to scare us, the movie would have been a lot better.  Because they were trying, really, really hard, and when you try that hard, it usually fails.

Also, the plot was a little muddled; a lot of flashbacks, a lot of people roughly the same age; at one point, we meet a girl whose eyes have been burned out, and apparently this is a surprise, because apparently we know her.  At this point, I thought, ""We do? You could have fooled me.""  If we did, they haven't even given us her name.

Top three problems with this movie:

1. Scares are cheap and infrequent.

2. Plot is difficult to follow

3. Not all the characters are developed--at all.  This includes the Big Evil Ghost-monster-thing that is present in all of these movies (you know, the thing that scares you when it jumps out, shouts BOOGAH BOOGAH, laughs and runs off) who I will say no more about for fear of giving away the one really interesting, disturbing part of this movie. Suffice it to say if BEG had been less two-dimensional, this movie would have A. made more sense, and B. been a lot more fascinating.

Top three highlights:

1. The little girl.  She's a better actor than her mommy. (There's always a little girl.)

2. The side-story involving the sex scandal, (Though it would have been a thousand times better if they had developed THAT too.)

3. The ... part at the end with the taser and stuff.  YOu'll understand when you see it.

Overall, I'd reccomend it, but only off the used or rental rack. You won't want to watch it again, but you won't be beating yourself up for the first time.",1135123200,3,1907,4.4
2192197,3,B0006Q9464,"It's been a few months since I saw this film, but what I have to say doesn't need that many details.  First of all, I'm a pretty big horror fan, but I can't totally get into the Asian horror film scene of the last decade or so.  Sure, there are a number of great films that I've seen, (Cure, Audition, Tale of Two Sisters, Uzumaki) but I find it tough to come up with too much enthusiasm for seeing that many more films from the the period.  The movement seems to basically be a combination of generic girl-ghost and a number of oddball horror/exploitation films that don't fit into any particular subgenre, or sound particularly thrilling to me.  This is one of those generic girl-ghost ones.  It's pretty well done, nicely shot and whatnot, much slicker than say Ringu or Ju-On or the original Dark Water but I don't think this subgenre needs to be endlessly repeated.  I don't actually have anything against the girl-ghost movie in and of itself, but it's too narrow to allow for excess repetition.  This expands out a little, reminding me of 'Stir of Echoes' and 'What Lies Beneath', but that's not really that far to go.  (One might suppose this is quite derivative of the latter, but the similar plot developments in each film are insufficiently novel for me to assume that this is the case.)  It's moderately scary at the beginning, but it tends toward overkill, as we see the ghost again and again in a very short timespan. (The opening scene is very good, the best of the movie, which is pretty much always a bad sign.) Then, when  we get to unravelling the mystery the whole things slows down a lot and is quite a bit more low-key, and a lot less tense.  Also the whole tech-horror aspect doesn't really work for me.  Like others, I'm not especially terrified of the telephone.  Frankly, Ringu and The Ring worked in spite of the technological element, rather than because of them.  I find it tough to imagine that I'm the only one who was initially hesitant about those films because they were about cursed videotapes.  But, whatever.

If you're a fan of the genre you definitely ought to see this.  It's pretty well done.  But, if you don't feel any particular need to see another girl-ghost movie, there's no strong reason why you should make an exception for this one.

2192228,2,B0006Q9464,"The storyline was rather bland and maybe it's just me, but the whole concept of people being scared when their phone is ringing has been highly played out.  There was one part that made me jump, but other than that, there isn't anything too scary and/or gory.  The child actress in this movie, was not very convincing.  Everytime she was ""going crazy"", I couldn't help but laugh at the poor acting.

The DVD title screen for this movie is my favorite part.  I kept thinking my own cell phone was interfering with the DVD player. haha.  Anyhow, I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing better to do.",1128556800,3,614,4.587155963302752

2192230,5,B0006Q9464,"Although I agree that this movie won't exactly scare you away from using your cell phone the way that Psycho scared you away from taking a shower, it's still an above average movie that is well worth viewing.

Fans of Ha Ji-won, who plays the intrepid and persistent reporter, won't be disappointed to see that she has grown up from the teenage comedies she is better known for.  The girl who plays Young-Ju does a convincing job of making you think she is possessed, which is all the more eerie for me since she resembles my Korean niece of about the same age.

I don't buy many DVDs, but this one is in my collection because the story is good, the directing is slick, the actors are talented (and the females good looking, which doesn't hurt), and it's just overall a solid film.",1123286400,2,781,4.4475524475524475

2192232,3,B0006Q9464,"Phone is a highly slick and glossy horror flick which doesn't fall into the same convoluted and confusing category of most Asian horror.  What it lacks in scares, it makes up with a very linear, easy to follow plot albeit predictable in a Hollywood kind of way.

It has it moments of scares and if you're new to the creepy and atmospheric world of Asian horror this is a good starting point.  If nothing else, it's worth checking out for the stunning performance of that amazing little 6 year old girl.  She gives a performance worthy of an Oscar.  This certianly isn't Ringu or Ju-On because it didn't scare me but it's entertaining and still a notch above anything Hollywood would do.",1119916800,3,686,4.590163934426229

2192234,4,B0006Q9464,"From the opening scene in an out-of-control elevator, this is a film that grabs the viewer and doesn't let go.  It's an excellent horror film, a term that has almost become oxymoronic.

When Ji-won, an investigative reporter, gets a new cell phone, she immediately starts receiving strange calls.  But when Yeong-ju, the young daughter of a friend, answers one of these same calls, she becomes immediately changed.  Ji-won must figure out the reason behind these strange calls if she's to have any chance to save Yeong-ju from the self-destructive path the phone seems to have put her on.

There's some genuine mystery to this film, which keeps it from becoming simply another retread horror movie.  Our heroine has to unravel the mystery - both who the phone number originally belonged to, and why it causes such misery to those who come in contact.

The acting is outstanding.  Ji-won Ha is excellent in the lead role, and Seo-woo Eun steals several scenes as the ""possessed"" young girl.  The direction is perfect, with muted colors and plenty of silence adding to the film's creepiness.

2192236,5,B0006Q9464,"PHONE concerns a young investigative journalist named Ji-Won, who begins to receive menacing calls on her mobile phone.  Suspecting it is one of the men she recently wrote an expos on, she has her number changed, but what she hears when her phone rings next is even more disturbing.  After her best friend's daughter accidentally receives one of the calls, the girl begins behaving erratically.  The only clue Ji-Won has to go on is the phone number that keeps appearing on her laptop, so she begins to look into the people who had her number previously, and what she finds is interesting indeed.

I'll be the first to admit that the premise of a supernatural force utilizing a cellular phone seemed hokey, but as the story progresses, the device is shown to not be a contrivance at all.  Even if this weren't the case, I'd still rate the movie highly.  It's simply a very effective scary movie, especially during the first half.  It won't get under your skin and haunt you like 'A Tale of Two Sisters,' but it should satisfy while viewing.  It's also a beautiful movie in all respects.  Ignore the clunky title and check it out.

The DVD is of very high quality with many extras including trailers, and cast interviews, including one with the little girl from the movie, who is very funny.  There are two deleted scenes, and the little girl gives hilarious commentary on selected scenes (prompted by an interviewer.)  There is also a lot of behind the scenes footage.

Show me an American child HALF that talented- her preformance is excelllent and then you get to see alot of her behind the scenes (all subtitled.) The movie is about a reporter who changes her cell number because a stalker is watching her after she wrote an article that lead to exposing a sex circle. The new number begins to ring with unregistered calls of noise. This leads her on a search of people who have had the number who have all died. A creepy story with an ending that makes sense.

I personally think a certain murder that started it all was self-defense. Reports that Tom Cruise bought the rights to this film and I can see that it will be ruined, so see it in it's original version!! No one else can play that little girl.",1109980800,5,1034,4.4136125654450264

The storyline is a female journalist uncovered a huge sex ring and the people involved are going to trial because of this she keeps getting threatening calls she decides to move to a new home near her best friend and she changes her number unfortunately the calls keep coming and when her best friends daughter answers the phone she somehow gets possessed by a vengeful ghost the journalist now has to figure out why these mysterious calls keep coming why the kid is possessed and how to save the kid from this ghost i can't give away any more than that however when the full story is revealed and you find out why the phone is cursed and who this vengeful ghost was in life and how she died i was shocked i never saw it coming the movie has a good ending which is rare for horror movies all the actors did a great job especially the female lead and the possessed kid

I got the dvd version the movie is in Korean with English subtitles I love foreign movies so reading the subtitles doesn't bother me but I know it bothers some please don't let the foreign language and subtitles stop you from watching this and other foreign movies once you get into the movie you won't even realize your reading subtitles

Phone is a story about possession and obsession; it really tells multiple stories at once. I really like the ghost-vengeance story, although it's been done dozens of times already. This particular film involves a young girl character, Young-Su, played creepily by Eun Seo-woo; most of her scenes were very creepy and unsettling. It has many jump-scares, some were great and some were predictable. Some disturbing imagery of ghosts, which I really like. There are plenty of twists, but I won't spoil them. The ending was good, but it is unfulfilling. It's not the most original horror film, but it definitely packs some scares.

Overall, Phone is a great horror film, although it is a bit predictable. A purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.
