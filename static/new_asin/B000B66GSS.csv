8082232,5,B000B66GSS,This was a great DVD for me! I'm a Cardinals fan and had no access to this footage except for grainy YouTube clips. And even though the Cardinals only won one of these series it was still great to relive them!,1411171200,,209,4.121951219512195

8082235,5,B000B66GSS,"It is fun to watch the great 80's that the Redbirds had. Too bad they couldn't win the championship in 85 and in 87. On a side note, it so awesome to see my hero, the shutout king himself John Tudor pitching in all his glory.",1324684800,,225,3.9130434782608696
8082236,3,B000B66GSS,"1982 and 1985 are half-hour summaries showing key plays and highlights with lots of cheesy music and bad fan shots.  1987 is an hour long showing more at-bats except where the Cardinals are getting blown out in the Metronome, but at least has some excerpts of Michaels play-by-play and Tim McCarver's color.  Worth it if you are a young Cardinals fan who missed it, and want to suffer the agony of losing 2 of 3 World Series in ""stomach punch to the gut"" fashion.

1982 Announcer - Dick Enberg
1985 Announcer - Al Michaels
1987 Announcer - Al Michaels",1254096000,4,551,4.545454545454546
8082237,3,B000B66GSS,"As there's no KC Royals package to be had, I was forced to buy the St. Louis Cardinals DVD to experience the joy that was 1985.  Yes, Denkinger's call was wrong, but the subsequent hits were right on the money, and the Royals might well have won without it.  And that 11-0 drubbing in game seven was just pretty to watch!
I enjoyed the 1987 highlights as well, but have yet to check out the '82 footage (who needs to see a Cardinals win?).  I keed, I keed.
Decent production for what it is and the era it was produced in.  Glad to own it, as any Royals fan should be (now if they'd only return to respectability in the modern world)...",1216080000,,635,4.180327868852459
8082238,2,B000B66GSS,"I give this DVD 5 stars for baseball, but zero for its simply awful 80's-era TV production styles.  The main problem with this video is that the majority of at-bats are NOT shown.  So you have no way of really following how the games developed.  Only key plays are shown, but usually you are just dropped into the situation (runners, outs, etc.).  The rest of the time is filled with some truly awful musical sequences of players and fans.

For the baseball that is actually shown, this video is a lot better than nothing.  You get some great moments with Whitey, Ozzie, Willie, and a the rest of the Cardinals 80's-era greats.  But you also have the pain of watching the Cardinals loose two of three World Series.

For the record, I'd like to say that Don Denkinger's call at first in game 6 of the '85 series was completely and utterly wrong.  This video proves it.",1167955200,9,867,4.471337579617835
