Plus they are not on HD or Blue Ray (like the 2 diff versions of the Original Star Wars movies and the Prequals)...so you MAY end up bying these again if you truly like them.  Again not a bad product, but Lucas needs to get less greedy on his merchandise!!!",1201651200,12,430,3.8636363636363638

3087371,4,B0012EM5CY,"I videotaped ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" off of TV when it aired.  However, what made it to TV was only a fraction of what the series could have been.  These three boxed DVD sets include ALL the episodes (Maybe 2/3 of the series was ever aired on TV) in the cleanest format possible, and a number of informative bonus discs chock-full of historical data about the real-life people and events Indy encounters along the way.

The series should not be compared too closely with the movies, although there are occasional nods from one to the other for die-hard fans.  The production values are top-notch for the time, and the writing yields a few truly delightful episodes.

Missing are the framing scenes featuring ""Old Indy"".  I admit, those were often too silly, and the episodes work better without them.  However, it would have been nice if they'd been included as extras.  (If anyone discovers them as a hidden ""Easter egg"", please give a holler!)",1484265600,2,958,4.798780487804878

3087439,3,B0012EM5CY,I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones and I have always wanted to get these series for my collection. I was very happy to finally find them online. I think that these series are a great introduction to history and is a neat exploration of the character. However the only thing I did not like the about this was how my DVD's were brought to my house. The package looks like it's old and used. I bought them new. There is some scuffing around the corners of the box sets and some of the disc holders are broken. The discs themselves are fine and play well on my blu ray. But for such a prize I wanted a good looking box set instead of a beaten up box sets.,1390953600,,647,4.023255813953488
3087440,3,B0012EM5CY,"The whole series would be a good way to introduce a young audience to the turn of the century historical events.  The WWI scenes are a bit graphic, so age selection may be in order.  Putting aside my reality meter (so I can enjoy the fact that Indy is meeting so many important figures in the era), I liked the 1st and 2nd sets.  The 3rd fell far short.  It became formulaic, with waaaaay too much time invested on Indy's romantic escapades.. the episode with him trying to keep up with three women became so trite, I never watched the last half.  The episode with him running around trying to get his phone hooked up has already been done as a cartoon spoof by the series Asterix and Obelix... this wasn't better.  It was disappointing to not have things happen in the series that would serve as harbingers for the future films.. like why he was actually scared of snakes... or where did the whip come from (it made a brief appearance in one episode.. and then inexplicably vanished from the writing).  I kept waiting for Salla to appear, because Indy already knows him in the first film.. but no joy.  So, while the filming was nicely done, and the historical references are interesting, it really could have been better written.. I am surprised that Lucas wasn't more careful with his scripts.  Lastly, it would have been nice to see the young Indy mature over the years.. demonstrating some hard-won judgement and wisdom from all of his experiences in life.. but again,... he is portrayed as being as clumsy and ignorant at the end of the series as when he started.  Rather than stepping up and helping with situations, he is content to let them evolve around him, with the named special characters saving the day.  Very disappointing.",1390694400,,1739,4.613636363636363
3087441,5,B0012EM5CY,"I highly recommend this, the whole series that is, to the whole family. What a wonderful history lesson this is too along with Indiana Jone's early adventures. I do have to say though the second volume is best, The War Years. The first few episodes is the grizzly gritty war of the trenches. If you do get thru it it moves to Africa which the adventures start. The Years of Change is a wonderful look into the years after the war which is very rarely talked about. But what makes all these collections well worth your time to watch on dvd is the extras. I can not think of another series of movies or TV shows with this many informative extras. Books, places, rear films of historical events and figures of which these adventures revolve around. Just first rate and please look up these events and places to find books on some of the featured speakers, which are authors most of them, and read their books. The treasure though starts with the Adventures of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and goes on beyond the DVD's.  Got this volume for Christmas and loved it. Huge fan of Indiana Jones and the world around him and the people as well.",1388016000,,1141,4.485576923076923

3087446,2,B0012EM5CY,"The acting, for the most part, is top notch. But George Lucas gave the writers a little too much leeway. Some of these are horribly written, boring, awkward and at times was just a chore to watch.",1377561600,,196,4.324324324324325

3087451,4,B0012EM5CY,"Credit really has to be given to George Lucas for producing a phenomenal television series that briefly illuminated screens across the nation in the wake of the wildly successful Indiana Jones movies. The production values were outstanding, and the location shooting in exotic places around the world made these shows unique. Unfortunately I missed quite a few of them when they appeared on the small screen, and the ones I did manage to tape were not the best quality. These three Young Indiana Jones collections solve that problem...in spades! Excellent DVD quality episodes backed some of the best historical documentaries I have ever seen, these give fans of the show an essential archive. Many of the included documentaries could easily stand on their own, providing valuable information and insight into some of the Twentieth Century's major events. Unfortunately, what this collection does not give you are the original tv shows, which had a distinct charm of their own. These have been shoehorned into (at times, unwieldy) narratives that sometimes don't seem to have much of a logical connection, and watching too many of them too close together highlights the absurdity of a single individual having been everywhere, done everything, and met everyone of historical importance. A good time to suspend your disbelief or at least send it out for pizza.",1374364800,,1359,5.181818181818182

3087465,5,B0012EM5CY,It is impossible for a TV series to have the production values of a full length movie and Sean Patrick Flanery will never be confused with Harrison Ford.  The adventures are interesting enough but the true value of these sets are the shorts on world history and the biographies of real people.  I bought this as a complete set - it wasn't cheap but I didn't regret it.,1361059200,,368,4.397058823529412
3087466,5,B0012EM5CY,"It helps to have lots of money when making a series. (Thank You Lucas!) Patrick at his best.

The commentaries are good , but I could look them up on Wikipedia.",1359417600,,225,4.255813953488372
3087468,3,B0012EM5CY,"I was really looking forward to watching this set of Indiana Jones DVDs but I have to say I was disappointed. The stories just aren't as good and far more liberties are taken with history. The one episode where Indy is a translator at the Versailles Conference does hit many major flaws in how the peace treaty was written but it also gives way to this ""we gave them victory but they threw it away"" spiel which would continue to run through the following episodes. While there were a few far-seeing people who saw the treaty terms as too harsh public opinion on the Allied side saw this as just. And Indy's boyhood friend was Paul Robeson?! That would have made it hard for him to get a security clearance when he rejoined the Army in the 1940s. The minidoc which is part of the DVD set made it sound as if he was simply a civil rights activist. Robeson was a communist stooge who would later be awarded the Stalin Prize for his unflagging propagandizing on behalf of the USSR. The minidoc used the term ""witch hunt"" and trotted out the same tired cliche that there were no communists in Hollywood etc. etc. when we now know there certainly WERE, thanks to records unveiled after the fall of communism.

Harrison Ford's appearance in the Blues episode seems to be this set's one redeeming feature.

It's a pity but at least I didn't spoend any money on this.",1355616000,,1358,4.471774193548387
3087469,5,B0012EM5CY,"I vaguely remembered this series when it ran on TV in the mid-nineties, but seeing it again in 2012 was a revelation. Wonderful series that is clearly meant to awaken a love of modern history in American viewers, who are often woefully ignorant of the world at large. The lighthearted, absurdly impractical adventures of the Indiana Jones franchise are balanced with some serious episodes that address war, colonialism, racism, sexism and exploitation of nature. Intended for teen viewers, this is an enjoyable and enlightening experience even for old timers who can learn a lot from the story line as well as the cameo appearances of dozens of historical figures, from Leo Tolstoy to Charles de Gaulle and Picasso to Sidney Bichet and Mata Hari. Young Indiana Jones meets them all, befriends them, fights them or loves them in his inimitable way... sometimes he does all three.  And the cast includes soon-to-be superstars like Daniel Craig, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Elizabeth Hurley and many more that you'll recognize today. Highly recommended.",1355356800,3,1047,5.195266272189349
3087470,5,B0012EM5CY,Loved all three volumnes; don't know why it is not on TV as are the Indiana Jones movies.

3087472,5,B0012EM5CY,The years of change give a whole new perspective of Indy.  Indy grows from the war years as a soldier to the full blown adventurer of Indiana Jones.  I wish there were more episodes on DVD!,1321228800,,189,4.222222222222222
3087473,5,B0012EM5CY,"A lot of people comment on the price and the actual series, but what I am most amazed by is the quality of the additional documentaries.  Each episode features two to six full length (25 to 60 minute) documentaries.  These were picked up by the History Channel, yeah they're that good.  There are two main narrators, both very good.  They feature a lot of old filmed footage and pictures, but rarely dramatizations.  They also feature several experts for each documentary episode.  Some examples of documentaries: Signing of the Treaty of Versailles, John Ford (director), Broadway in the 20s, T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia), The Algonquin Round Table, Hemingway, etc...  But we're talking over 100 documentaries!  Nice!

The series is also good.  Paramount pulls from a broad pool of talented supporting actors.  Many portray real life figures, and most do it pretty well.  There are a lot of historical events that Indiana Jones is involved in, but it never really comes across as being too inaccurate.  He is mainly involved on a less prominent scale and the real life figures are depicted pretty accurately.  Watching the documentaries you see that there is some artistic license taken, but that Spielberg wanted to keep the overall history intact.  Some events take place in different years historically than took place in Young Indiana, but usually these are just off my months or a few years, and there isn't really a big emphasis on the years after the end of WW1.

The third set really has what I consider the best of the series.  These are the years after world war 1 and feature an amazing diversity of locations and events.  From Broadway to Chicago gangsters to Hollywood, and a trip to Indonesia, this series will keep any history buff satisfied.  Just watch the episodes with an open mind, then watch the documentaries to see how it all really happened.",1318982400,2,1863,4.875796178343949
3087474,5,B0012EM5CY,"This was a gift for my husband.  Here's what he had to say:  ""Excellent follow-on to Volume II.  Special features supplementing the story are informative for all viewers.  Dovetails well with subsequent Indiana Jones movies.  The introduction of real historical figures and events provides young viewers painless history lessons.""",1318550400,,330,5.653061224489796
3087485,5,B0012EM5CY,"This series Wraps up the World war one storyline but goes into other aspects of the early 20th century. Indy still meets historical figures such as Ernest Hemingway and the untouchable Elliot Ness This set actually contains my two favorite episodes of the entire series, Masks of evil and Treasure of the peacocks eye. I owned these two on VHS and after watching the whole series on DVD and they still remain the best of the series. after World war one wraps up Indy attends the Paris peace conference also called the Treaty of Versailles this is one of the most important moments in 20th century history because it's Ramifications echoed through the rest of the 20th century and is still felt even today. The documentaries return and still manage to inform. Indy manage to meet his father one final time before the Events of The Last Crusade. it is sad that such a great series has to conclude but it doesn't since the series is a pretense to the great Indiana Jones movie series. it is said that Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg wanted to know what Indiana was like as a young man after watching the beginning sequence of The Last Crusade and so this series was born. What is great about this set is that Harrison Ford makes a cameo as an adult Indy recounting one of his many adventures. Again this series is highly recommended for fans of Indiana Jones that want to see all his great adventures.",1313366400,,1401,4.563492063492063
3087486,5,B0012EM5CY,I have thoroughly enjoyed the Young Indiana Jones series . . . each segment is well done and so much superior to the television viewing now available!  I would recommend this series as excellent family viewing since each segment involves history and well known historical figures and the actors and actresses are are quality performers.  In my opinion this series is a good investment if you enjoy well done and entertaining family action movies.,1310169600,,446,5.013513513513513

Like 24, I just didn't want to stop with just one episode.  Action. Adventure. Comedy. Romance.  All in one.

I also bought the other two volumes... they are all fabulous!

3087491,5,B0012EM5CY,"As a UCLA graduate in history, I eagerly watched ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" when it appeared as a TV series in the early 1990s, and thought it so well done that I submitted a positive letter to TV GUIDE that they chose to publish.  As a parent of young children in the late 1990s, I invested in the series when it became available as a 12-videotape set, and it paid off with my children through the years developing a compassionate, comprehensive understanding of World War I era history.  We have looked forward to all 22 adventures being available and affordable in DVD form--and that time is NOW with volumes 1, 2, and 3 at discounted Amazon prices!  My children, husband, and I have loved seeing the adventures we missed, and have been enriched by the many documentaries spread out through all 3 volumes on related topics, such as the development of espionage and air warfare during WWI.  None of the documentaries go longer than 30 minutes, so that's the perfect length for the high-school history class, they're accompanied by stirring Indiana Jones music, and they're the first documentaries my kids say are interesting and not boring!  My daughter's history teacher is planning to use some of the documentaries to help his students learn from history and not repeat its mistakes.  Don't miss your opportunity--courtesy of Mr. George Lucas and Amazon--to do the same!",1251417600,7,1384,4.8931623931623935
3087492,5,B0012EM5CY,When you think in the production of a TV show like this you definately have to thank George Lucas and Rick McCallum for making a good quality product like this one. I've just finished the last DVD of the set and I have to say that eventhough the price is high (No Paramount DVD is cheap) the editing in the episodes as well as the short documentaries create a learning experience for all of us who consider themselves a history buff. I wish more DVD sets were like this one.,1245628800,,474,4.277777777777778
3087493,4,B0012EM5CY,"Well, volume three is cut down to a more manageable 10 discs, of  death-defying adventure in exotic locations, propitious meetings with interesting or soon-to-be famous people, and enough short informational features about historic people and  events to satisfy anyone's History Channel jones. After watching all three sets and dimly recalling the series as it aired, though, I still have doubts about the wisdom of  cobbling together two episodes to make one movie-length sequence. This results in some very odd pairings and a pronounced hiccup at about mid-point, where suddenly the story lurches off in another direction entirely. And omitting the poignant `bookend' character of `Old Indy' entirely?

At least this package included a guest appearance by Harrison Ford himself, as `somewhat middle-aged Indy', as well as some other nifty guest appearances; Anne Heche comes to mind almost at once (in the  Scandal of 1920 episode). This series wraps up the last dying twitches of World War One (including an encounter with a still quite twitching Dracula - kind of an icky episode, that one. I wouldn't  allow young children to watch it) and young Indy's attendance at the Paris Peace conference. Then, he returns home to pick up something of his old life again, scrounging summer jobs in Chicago, playing the blues, on Broadway and in Hollywood in the silent-movie era. As far as flamboyant and outsized characters went, Hollywood of that time would have been well worth a season of its own. As it is, Indy only scratches the surface, hanging out with young John Ford, Irving Thalberg and Erich von Stroheim.

The extras are lavish, and perhaps more than a strict fan of the series would really want to pay for - but as far as introducing children painlessly to events of the early 20th century, there is none better: where else could you find informational shorts on Edith Wharton, the French Foreign Legion, Dracula, Gertrude Bell, Ben Hecht, Tin Pan Alley, Elliott Ness and the Ottoman Empire?",1237593600,6,2000,5.042424242424242
3087494,5,B0012EM5CY,"I am a big fan of the series....both in TV and in the movies. I was thrilled when I heard these were coming out but have had to wait a bit for the price to come down.

This is an exceptional series...beyond anything I've seen on TV. It was basically like watching an Indy film every week.

But, to those at Amazon who wrote the re-cap review/product description:

The name of the man who plays young Indiana Jones is Sean Patrick Flanery...NOT Robert Sean Leonard. If you want to see Robert, you can find him in the TV series ""House"" and any number of films particularly ""Dead Poet's Society"". However, if you want to see a young man who really began his career playing a younger version of Indiana Jones to perfection, go see any film with Sean Patrick Flanery in it.",1237161600,,768,4.394366197183099

3087498,5,B0012EM5CY,"Once again, George Lucas has thoroughly entertained and intrigued us with his use of combining history and adventure in Young Indy's life in a serious and humorous way.

Fact and/or fiction -- a very nice way to take on an adventure and possibly learn a little history as well.",1216080000,2,398,4.671428571428572
3087499,5,B0012EM5CY,"I fell in love with the first volume of this DVD release - if only for the special features. (See my review under that title.) The re-edited stories on Volume one were confusing but the 10- hours (!) of NEW documentaries blew me away! George Lucas and Rick McCallum put their money where there mouth was (and Paramount went out on a limb by putting 10 DVDS in one set) and it shows. The documentaries are well researched and use the experts in the field.

I'm not a big War Years fan so Volume 2 was just okay for me but - again - high quality documentaries were attached.

Then came this volume. First, I headed to the documentaries - Jazz - Louis Armstrong - Ben Hecht - The Algonquin Round table. Each was better than the next with super footage in crisp quality prints and all the experts. Then I decided to watch the series episodes on the Blues and Hollywood. I'm as big music fan so I gave them a shot. WOW! Was I impressed! The Mystery of The Blues episode is loaded with great music - yes, full musical numbers. And each of the three women that Indy falls for is more gorgeous than the next. And how many films feature clarinetist Sidney Bechet as it's lead character for 90 minutes? (You even get a bit of Harrison Ford at beginning and end!). The last episode on early Hollywood was great too with lots of cool stunt work and an over-the-top performance by the actor playing eccentric Director Eric von Stroheim.

I was really sorry to hear that the series ended with this episode. I'm hooked!

All the volumes belong in every school and public library as a learning tool. Each of the 25-35 minute docs is a new learning tool for adults as well as older children.  I certainly give this volume FIVE STARS! And a BIG thanks to Lucas, McCallum and Paramount!

3087500,5,B0012EM5CY,"George Lucas should definitely produce more Young Indiana Jones episodes. The episodes of volume three are all terrific and represent a wide range of events, genre, and most important, allow further character development of Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones gets to teach some history while endearing himself to us as a good man with a keen mind and open heart facing his own life lessons. New episodes might finally explain how this trusting young man he created grew to be a cynical adult of the feature films. It's this satisfied viewer's hope that Sean Patrick Flanery finally gets the credit he deserves for his many exquisite performances throughout this series. The episode in Italy with the young Ernie Hemingway is as good a ""buddy movie"" as Hope and Crosby, Newman and Redford, or any other Hollywood team has ever created.",1213833600,4,828,4.9640287769784175

3087503,5,B0012EM5CY,"Most people rank this one the worst of the sets, but for me, it contains some of my all time favorite episodes that I remember watching on TV as a kid.  I guess first would have to be Mystery of the Blues, since it features Harrison Ford as Indy age 50, and also shows us some of Indy's college life at the University of Chicago.  My second fav would be Scandal of 1920, which I found very entertaining, and my third would have to be Treasure of the Peacock's Eye, in which INdy first searches for the diamond seen at the beginning of Temple of Doom.  Hollywood Follies is a good one to, slow at the start, but gets interesting as Indy heads into the desert to shoot a John Ford movie.  If Lucas had been able to continue the series, he was planning to make an episode where Indy meets Rene Belloq, and another where he begins his romance with Marion Ravenwood.  I really wish he could have fulfilled his vision, but then again, if he didn't pull it off well it seriously would have altered all our visions about Raiders of the Lost Ark.",1212969600,3,1037,4.270408163265306

No longer is Indy a bright eyed youth, but rather a growing teenager endowed with a limitless sense of curiosity and penchance for survival. ""Years of Change"" finds Indy encountering Ernest Hemingway, Lowell Thomas, Bronislaw Malinowski, John Ford, Al Capone, Erich Von Stronheim, Woodrow Wilson, Ho Chi Minh, Robert Goddard, and other historical personages.  Each and every `feature' episode is marvelous, with my favorite being ""The Mystery of the Blues"".  Where else can you find such a mix of music and mystery?  Can't forget the Harrison Ford introduction and conclusion either.

Film fans will love the ""Hollywood Follies"".  Literary researchers will certainly learn something about Hemingway from ""Tales of Innocence.""  ""The Winds of Change"" casts a long shadow on our present situation as the Treaty of Versailles and Paris Peace Conference is featured predominantly.

No TV series will ever touch viewers like ""Young Indiana Jones"".  The sheer historical research in both the episodes and special features is unparalleled in modern history.  If Plato, Plutarch, Aristotle, and DaVinci were alive at the same time, Lucas and Spielberg would have hired them as consultants on ""Young Indy"".

Just maybe, there is a Young Indy Time Travel series in the works behind closed doors.  Wouldn't that be nice...

Look for this at your local video store or online at [..].

3321936,3,B0012EM5CY,I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones and I have always wanted to get these series for my collection. I was very happy to finally find them online. I think that these series are a great introduction to history and is a neat exploration of the character. However the only thing I did not like the about this was how my DVD's were brought to my house. The package looks like it's old and used. I bought them new. There is some scuffing around the corners of the box sets and some of the disc holders are broken. The discs themselves are fine and play well on my blu ray. But for such a prize I wanted a good looking box set instead of a beaten up box sets.,1390953600,,647,4.023255813953488
3321937,3,B0012EM5CY,"The whole series would be a good way to introduce a young audience to the turn of the century historical events.  The WWI scenes are a bit graphic, so age selection may be in order.  Putting aside my reality meter (so I can enjoy the fact that Indy is meeting so many important figures in the era), I liked the 1st and 2nd sets.  The 3rd fell far short.  It became formulaic, with waaaaay too much time invested on Indy's romantic escapades.. the episode with him trying to keep up with three women became so trite, I never watched the last half.  The episode with him running around trying to get his phone hooked up has already been done as a cartoon spoof by the series Asterix and Obelix... this wasn't better.  It was disappointing to not have things happen in the series that would serve as harbingers for the future films.. like why he was actually scared of snakes... or where did the whip come from (it made a brief appearance in one episode.. and then inexplicably vanished from the writing).  I kept waiting for Salla to appear, because Indy already knows him in the first film.. but no joy.  So, while the filming was nicely done, and the historical references are interesting, it really could have been better written.. I am surprised that Lucas wasn't more careful with his scripts.  Lastly, it would have been nice to see the young Indy mature over the years.. demonstrating some hard-won judgement and wisdom from all of his experiences in life.. but again,... he is portrayed as being as clumsy and ignorant at the end of the series as when he started.  Rather than stepping up and helping with situations, he is content to let them evolve around him, with the named special characters saving the day.  Very disappointing.",1390694400,,1739,4.613636363636363
3321938,5,B0012EM5CY,"I highly recommend this, the whole series that is, to the whole family. What a wonderful history lesson this is too along with Indiana Jone's early adventures. I do have to say though the second volume is best, The War Years. The first few episodes is the grizzly gritty war of the trenches. If you do get thru it it moves to Africa which the adventures start. The Years of Change is a wonderful look into the years after the war which is very rarely talked about. But what makes all these collections well worth your time to watch on dvd is the extras. I can not think of another series of movies or TV shows with this many informative extras. Books, places, rear films of historical events and figures of which these adventures revolve around. Just first rate and please look up these events and places to find books on some of the featured speakers, which are authors most of them, and read their books. The treasure though starts with the Adventures of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and goes on beyond the DVD's.  Got this volume for Christmas and loved it.

3321948,4,B0012EM5CY,"Credit really has to be given to George Lucas for producing a phenomenal television series that briefly illuminated screens across the nation in the wake of the wildly successful Indiana Jones movies. The production values were outstanding, and the location shooting in exotic places around the world made these shows unique. Unfortunately I missed quite a few of them when they appeared on the small screen, and the ones I did manage to tape were not the best quality. These three Young Indiana Jones collections solve that problem...in spades! Excellent DVD quality episodes backed some of the best historical documentaries I have ever seen, these give fans of the show an essential archive. Many of the included documentaries could easily stand on their own, providing valuable information and insight into some of the Twentieth Century's major events. Unfortunately, what this collection does not give you are the original tv shows, which had a distinct charm of their own. These have been shoehorned into (at times, unwieldy) narratives that sometimes don't seem to have much of a logical connection, and watching too many of them too close together highlights the absurdity of a single individual having been everywhere, done everything, and met everyone of historical importance. A good time to suspend your disbelief or at least send it out for pizza.",1374364800,,1359,5.181818181818182

3321965,3,B0012EM5CY,"I was really looking forward to watching this set of Indiana Jones DVDs but I have to say I was disappointed. The stories just aren't as good and far more liberties are taken with history. The one episode where Indy is a translator at the Versailles Conference does hit many major flaws in how the peace treaty was written but it also gives way to this ""we gave them victory but they threw it away"" spiel which would continue to run through the following episodes. While there were a few far-seeing people who saw the treaty terms as too harsh public opinion on the Allied side saw this as just. And Indy's boyhood friend was Paul Robeson?! That would have made it hard for him to get a security clearance when he rejoined the Army in the 1940s. The minidoc which is part of the DVD set made it sound as if he was simply a civil rights activist. Robeson was a communist stooge who would later be awarded the Stalin Prize for his unflagging propagandizing on behalf of the USSR. The minidoc used the term ""witch hunt"" and trotted out the same tired cliche that there were no communists in Hollywood etc. etc. when we now know there certainly WERE, thanks to records unveiled after the fall of communism.

Harrison Ford's appearance in the Blues episode seems to be this set's one redeeming feature.

It's a pity but at least I didn't spoend any money on this.",1355616000,,1358,4.471774193548387
3321966,5,B0012EM5CY,"I vaguely remembered this series when it ran on TV in the mid-nineties, but seeing it again in 2012 was a revelation. Wonderful series that is clearly meant to awaken a love of modern history in American viewers, who are often woefully ignorant of the world at large. The lighthearted, absurdly impractical adventures of the Indiana Jones franchise are balanced with some serious episodes that address war, colonialism, racism, sexism and exploitation of nature. Intended for teen viewers, this is an enjoyable and enlightening experience even for old timers who can learn a lot from the story line as well as the cameo appearances of dozens of historical figures, from Leo Tolstoy to Charles de Gaulle and Picasso to Sidney Bichet and Mata Hari. Young Indiana Jones meets them all, befriends them, fights them or loves them in his inimitable way... sometimes he does all three.  And the cast includes soon-to-be superstars like Daniel Craig, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Elizabeth Hurley and many more that you'll recognize today. Highly recommended.",1355356800,3,1047,5.195266272189349

3321970,5,B0012EM5CY,"A lot of people comment on the price and the actual series, but what I am most amazed by is the quality of the additional documentaries.  Each episode features two to six full length (25 to 60 minute) documentaries.  These were picked up by the History Channel, yeah they're that good.  There are two main narrators, both very good.  They feature a lot of old filmed footage and pictures, but rarely dramatizations.  They also feature several experts for each documentary episode.  Some examples of documentaries: Signing of the Treaty of Versailles, John Ford (director), Broadway in the 20s, T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia), The Algonquin Round Table, Hemingway, etc...  But we're talking over 100 documentaries!  Nice!

The series is also good.  Paramount pulls from a broad pool of talented supporting actors.  Many portray real life figures, and most do it pretty well.  There are a lot of historical events that Indiana Jones is involved in, but it never really comes across as being too inaccurate.  He is mainly involved on a less prominent scale and the real life figures are depicted pretty accurately.  Watching the documentaries you see that there is some artistic license taken, but that Spielberg wanted to keep the overall history intact.  Some events take place in different years historically than took place in Young Indiana, but usually these are just off my months or a few years, and there isn't really a big emphasis on the years after the end of WW1.

The third set really has what I consider the best of the series.  These are the years after world war 1 and feature an amazing diversity of locations and events.  From Broadway to Chicago gangsters to Hollywood, and a trip to Indonesia, this series will keep any history buff satisfied.  Just watch the episodes with an open mind, then watch the documentaries to see how it all really happened.",1318982400,2,1863,4.875796178343949

3321982,5,B0012EM5CY,"This series Wraps up the World war one storyline but goes into other aspects of the early 20th century. Indy still meets historical figures such as Ernest Hemingway and the untouchable Elliot Ness This set actually contains my two favorite episodes of the entire series, Masks of evil and Treasure of the peacocks eye. I owned these two on VHS and after watching the whole series on DVD and they still remain the best of the series. after World war one wraps up Indy attends the Paris peace conference also called the Treaty of Versailles this is one of the most important moments in 20th century history because it's Ramifications echoed through the rest of the 20th century and is still felt even today. The documentaries return and still manage to inform. Indy manage to meet his father one final time before the Events of The Last Crusade. it is sad that such a great series has to conclude but it doesn't since the series is a pretense to the great Indiana Jones movie series. it is said that Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg wanted to know what Indiana was like as a young man after watching the beginning sequence of The Last Crusade and so this series was born. What is great about this set is that Harrison Ford makes a cameo as an adult Indy recounting one of his many adventures.

As a parent of young children in the late 1990s, I invested in the series when it became available as a 12-videotape set, and it paid off with my children through the years developing a compassionate, comprehensive understanding of World War I era history.  We have looked forward to all 22 adventures being available and affordable in DVD form--and that time is NOW with volumes 1, 2, and 3 at discounted Amazon prices!  My children, husband, and I have loved seeing the adventures we missed, and have been enriched by the many documentaries spread out through all 3 volumes on related topics, such as the development of espionage and air warfare during WWI.  None of the documentaries go longer than 30 minutes, so that's the perfect length for the high-school history class, they're accompanied by stirring Indiana Jones music, and they're the first documentaries my kids say are interesting and not boring!

3321990,4,B0012EM5CY,"Well, volume three is cut down to a more manageable 10 discs, of  death-defying adventure in exotic locations, propitious meetings with interesting or soon-to-be famous people, and enough short informational features about historic people and  events to satisfy anyone's History Channel jones. After watching all three sets and dimly recalling the series as it aired, though, I still have doubts about the wisdom of  cobbling together two episodes to make one movie-length sequence. This results in some very odd pairings and a pronounced hiccup at about mid-point, where suddenly the story lurches off in another direction entirely. And omitting the poignant `bookend' character of `Old Indy' entirely?

At least this package included a guest appearance by Harrison Ford himself, as `somewhat middle-aged Indy', as well as some other nifty guest appearances; Anne Heche comes to mind almost at once (in the  Scandal of 1920 episode). This series wraps up the last dying twitches of World War One (including an encounter with a still quite twitching Dracula - kind of an icky episode, that one. I wouldn't  allow young children to watch it) and young Indy's attendance at the Paris Peace conference. Then, he returns home to pick up something of his old life again, scrounging summer jobs in Chicago, playing the blues, on Broadway and in Hollywood in the silent-movie era. As far as flamboyant and outsized characters went, Hollywood of that time would have been well worth a season of its own. As it is, Indy only scratches the surface, hanging out with young John Ford, Irving Thalberg and Erich von Stroheim.

The extras are lavish, and perhaps more than a strict fan of the series would really want to pay for - but as far as introducing children painlessly to events of the early 20th century, there is none better: where else could you find informational shorts on Edith Wharton, the French Foreign Legion, Dracula, Gertrude Bell, Ben Hecht, Tin Pan Alley, Elliott Ness and the Ottoman Empire?",1237593600,6,2000,5.042424242424242

But, to those at Amazon who wrote the re-cap review/product description:

The name of the man who plays young Indiana Jones is Sean Patrick Flanery...NOT Robert Sean Leonard. If you want to see Robert, you can find him in the TV series ""House"" and any number of films particularly ""Dead Poet's Society"".

3321995,5,B0012EM5CY,"Once again, George Lucas has thoroughly entertained and intrigued us with his use of combining history and adventure in Young Indy's life in a serious and humorous way.  We also enjoyed all the many extras that give us the background on the historical figures we encounter along with Indy.  Fact and/or fiction -- a very nice way to take on an adventure and possibly learn a little history as well.",1216080000,2,398,4.671428571428572
3321996,5,B0012EM5CY,"I fell in love with the first volume of this DVD release - if only for the special features. (See my review under that title.) The re-edited stories on Volume one were confusing but the 10- hours (!) of NEW documentaries blew me away! George Lucas and Rick McCallum put their money where there mouth was (and Paramount went out on a limb by putting 10 DVDS in one set) and it shows. The documentaries are well researched and use the experts in the field.

I'm not a big War Years fan so Volume 2 was just okay for me but - again - high quality documentaries were attached.

Then came this volume. First, I headed to the documentaries - Jazz - Louis Armstrong - Ben Hecht - The Algonquin Round table. Each was better than the next with super footage in crisp quality prints and all the experts. Then I decided to watch the series episodes on the Blues and Hollywood. I'm as big music fan so I gave them a shot. WOW! Was I impressed! The Mystery of The Blues episode is loaded with great music - yes, full musical numbers. And each of the three women that Indy falls for is more gorgeous than the next. And how many films feature clarinetist Sidney Bechet as it's lead character for 90 minutes? (You even get a bit of Harrison Ford at beginning and end!). The last episode on early Hollywood was great too with lots of cool stunt work and an over-the-top performance by the actor playing eccentric Director Eric von Stroheim.

I was really sorry to hear that the series ended with this episode. I'm hooked!

All the volumes belong in every school and public library as a learning tool. Each of the 25-35 minute docs is a new learning tool for adults as well as older children.  I certainly give this volume FIVE STARS! And a BIG thanks to Lucas, McCallum and Paramount!

3321997,5,B0012EM5CY,"George Lucas should definitely produce more Young Indiana Jones episodes. The episodes of volume three are all terrific and represent a wide range of events, genre, and most important, allow further character development of Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones gets to teach some history while endearing himself to us as a good man with a keen mind and open heart facing his own life lessons. New episodes might finally explain how this trusting young man he created grew to be a cynical adult of the feature films. It's this satisfied viewer's hope that Sean Patrick Flanery finally gets the credit he deserves for his many exquisite performances throughout this series. The episode in Italy with the young Ernie Hemingway is as good a ""buddy movie"" as Hope and Crosby, Newman and Redford, or any other Hollywood team has ever created.",1213833600,4,828,4.9640287769784175

3322000,5,B0012EM5CY,"Most people rank this one the worst of the sets, but for me, it contains some of my all time favorite episodes that I remember watching on TV as a kid.  I guess first would have to be Mystery of the Blues, since it features Harrison Ford as Indy age 50, and also shows us some of Indy's college life at the University of Chicago.  My second fav would be Scandal of 1920, which I found very entertaining, and my third would have to be Treasure of the Peacock's Eye, in which INdy first searches for the diamond seen at the beginning of Temple of Doom.  Hollywood Follies is a good one to, slow at the start, but gets interesting as Indy heads into the desert to shoot a John Ford movie.  If Lucas had been able to continue the series, he was planning to make an episode where Indy meets Rene Belloq, and another where he begins his romance with Marion Ravenwood.  I really wish he could have fulfilled his vision, but then again, if he didn't pull it off well it seriously would have altered all our visions about Raiders of the Lost Ark.",1212969600,3,1037,4.270408163265306

3322014,4,B0012EM5CY,I loved the series on Young Iniana Jones and I have enjoyed the series.  So of it is pretty far fetched on who he meets but the characters are always interesting.  The nice thing about this is the extras you get with the series.  You get the life stories of all the true adventures of the actual people.  The stories are informative and you learn about legends in their own field.  In this series an example is you learn about the director John Ford.  This is a good introduction to history for the adult and child alike.  If you like history around the time of the First world war this will be a great addition to your collection.,1212019200,2,631,4.296610169491525

3322016,5,B0012EM5CY,"The release of the last volume in the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles was highly anticipated, and well worth the wait.

No longer is Indy a bright eyed youth, but rather a growing teenager endowed with a limitless sense of curiosity and penchance for survival. ""Years of Change"" finds Indy encountering Ernest Hemingway, Lowell Thomas, Bronislaw Malinowski, John Ford, Al Capone, Erich Von Stronheim, Woodrow Wilson, Ho Chi Minh, Robert Goddard, and other historical personages.  Each and every `feature' episode is marvelous, with my favorite being ""The Mystery of the Blues"".  Where else can you find such a mix of music and mystery?  Can't forget the Harrison Ford introduction and conclusion either.

Film fans will love the ""Hollywood Follies"".  Literary researchers will certainly learn something about Hemingway from ""Tales of Innocence.""  ""The Winds of Change"" casts a long shadow on our present situation as the Treaty of Versailles and Paris Peace Conference is featured predominantly.

No TV series will ever touch viewers like ""Young Indiana Jones"".  The sheer historical research in both the episodes and special features is unparalleled in modern history.  If Plato, Plutarch, Aristotle, and DaVinci were alive at the same time, Lucas and Spielberg would have hired them as consultants on ""Young Indy"".

Just maybe, there is a Young Indy Time Travel series in the works behind closed doors.  Wouldn't that be nice...

Look for this at your local video store or online at [..].

I remain,
A fan of historical entertainment.

And considering the quality of what you get. A flimsy cardboard box.
Sorry to say price is a key factor in rating.
Eventually he WILL do like he did with our beloved Star Wars and give his fans what they want (but not exactly) when he is feeling greedy again.
He will continue to tease us so he can continue to milk us.
