How in the world did I ever purchase a movie from a dealer in Bangkok?  I am willing to bet this movie is on par with the other movies he is in.  Action, 10 thousand bullets flying around and only 2 bad guys go down, or three bullets fly and 15 bad guys go down.  Like one, like them all.  Hate one, you will never appreaciate his movies.",1380326400,,515,4.02970297029703
