8603600,5,B00EBJ63C0,"I love the flow of nature scenes in ""4 Earth"".  There is nothing but pure wildlife here, and the sightings of a few creatures living in each habitat are truly authentic.  Each video views stunning, close-up images of the earth, with real, live nature sounds to match.  If you want to flood your room with the sounds and sights of nature - this is your video.",1389571200,,358,4.393939393939394
8603601,5,B00EBJ63C0,Purchased this DVD to help with meditation and relaxation and it is amazing.  Beautiful footage that makes me feel at peace.  Got it for my friend to put on while she does her yoga in the morning and she loves it as well.,1389139200,,221,4.116279069767442
8603602,5,B00EBJ63C0,"4 EARTH is an exquisite and majestic hour-long melding of nature sounds and images from the four ecosystems of ocean, stream, river, and pond.  With 4 EARTH, Dean and Dudley Evenson have given us a DVD that is at once beautiful and practical.  The beauty depicted is stunning and dynamic yet eloquent and peaceful.  The practicality lies  in 4 EARTH's utility for relaxation, meditation, and education.

In a brilliant stroke the Evensons give the viewer an option of whether to watch the video with audio nature only or to overlay music thoughtfully selected from the their Soundings of the Planet catalogue.  The gentle melodies and textures add an opportunity for deeper connection with the scenic vistas that were shot mostly near the North Cascades mountain range and Puget Sound.  As an added bonus, all four ecosystems can be viewed simultaneously in the four quarters of the screen.

4 EARTH helps people connect with the amazing planet that supports us.  And it will help those who already feel that connection to go to a deeper level of respect and appreciation.  From flowers, wildlife, and waves, to mountains, trees, and bird calls, everything fits together and the viewer feels intimately part of it.  I highly recommend it.",1381190400,,1238,4.990243902439024
