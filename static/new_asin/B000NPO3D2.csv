2777136,5,B000NPO3D2,this is a very powerful cd- we had the honor of going to a screening of this c.d. and a small lecture from the woman who made this documentary.,1189814400,4,143,3.9655172413793105
2777137,5,B000NPO3D2,"This was an incredible opportunity that in my opinion was blown.  I think before these two met it would have been helpful if they had known or it was made clear what they hoped to gain from the encounter.  Instead it feels like they were just thrown together and neither truely knew what they were after,  Also I think the beginning stories, explanations, details of their lives were too short and uninvolved.  The whole thing seemed to need more detail.  As for the editors review saying that it felt intrusive at times.....I am not sure thats the proper wording.  These woman each had different hopes for themselves.  Goeths daugther gave the impression that she wanted Helen to tell her she was indeed not like her father.  Monika can't seem to come to terms wth the fact that she has to determine her own worth and recognize she is indeed not her father on her own.  Helen is much more sad in my opinion.  A life full of pain and hurt.  It is hard to truely appreciate all that must have been taken from her and what she was able to reclaim during the visit.  A truely heartbreaking scene was when she stood on the steps of Goeths old house and told about how many times she was pushed down them by him and how she went up the steps 2 at a time out of fear.  I did not go away thinking these two were friends.  I think it was because I am not sure they had the opportunity to think about what they wanted from each other.  Monika wanted to feel less guilt I think.  Helen wanted justice, understanding, perhaps to get her power, dignity, and worth back.....so many things perhps....its too hard to imagine.  I think Each of the ladies should have been asked more questions about their meeting prior to going, perhaps a psychiatrist could have prepared them better.  But I think the meeting might have gone better, had they knew what they wanted more.  Its a good program, but leaves you wanting more closure nd more information.",1181433600,15,1932,4.452991452991453
2777138,1,B000NPO3D2,"It is really hard to understand why it is so hard to include the additional 20-30 Mb extra material in the initial release.

Do marketing people think we - the consumers are silly.

THis ""Normal Edition"" ""Special Ed."" ""Collectors Ed."" ""Ultimate Ed."" ""Unrated Edition"" game has hit the ceiling already, and now the ""Preview Edition""?!?

2777147,4,B000NPO3D2,I was surprised to find that this documentary had been done.  It really shows the human drama and tragedy from two different perspectives.  They are both incredibly damaged people and my heart goes out to both (and all) as they struggle to deal with the horror from so long ago.  Truly was a Heart of Darkness.,1438819200,,310,4.5

2777150,5,B000NPO3D2,"A truly memorable, haunting presentation of the meeting between Monika, the daughter of Amon  Goeth, and Helen Rosenzweig, Goeth's former Jewish servant girl. Monika is shocked to learn of her father's cruelty in World War 11and his hanging by the Polish tribunal. Helen relives her horrific Holocaust past .

  The meeting between the two is a reminder to all of us of the savagery of the Nazi era and the after effects on the fortunate survivors, many  whom never recuperated even after creating new live in other countries.",1435363200,,526,4.931818181818182

2777160,5,B000NPO3D2,"Being familiar with communal guilt, I felt Monika's pain in trying to understand the incomprehensible acts of her father. In addition, I was proud of of the way Helen both confronted and comforted her. This documentary is a must see.",1425081600,,233,4.85

2777162,5,B000NPO3D2,"This is not about the film  as much as an addendum that is fascinating: Monika Hertwig had a child with a Nigerian man in 1970, and the little girl was put up for adoption.  She grew up in Munich, a black German, not knowing that her grandfather was Amon Goeth.  She found out as an adult when she discovered a book Monika wrote, and it completely floored her.

2777163,5,B000NPO3D2,the only thing i thought was bad was that helena could have been a little more understanding with monika because monika didn't know her father and no one really told her the truth so the anger helena had for amon was put on the wrong person she should have been a little more compassionate and listened more to monika as to what she was told by her mother...there are times u can see monika is overwhelmed by helena and really seemed like a deer in headlights....i know the pain  helena had to have felt but....the anger she still has was def projected at the wrong person...so i feel there was a little to much of fthat.....it felt helena was blaming monika for what happen to her....but outside of that this is worth seeing,1422489600,,725,4.451127819548872

2777165,5,B000NPO3D2,"I actually agree with you. If anyone can put themselves in the situation of both women, they may understand your comment much better. I understand how emotional Monica is, this emotion makes her an honest and one of the most decent human beings on earth (forget me caping letters, don't feel like it) Anyway, Helen, too, is a survivor who was treated for years as a subhuman, and has post traumatic stress syndrome. Both women are incredible in my book. I advise anyone who plans to watch this bring a BOX of tissue. I had to put the film on pause so many times to gather more strength to finish it. Very upsetting film, but the story needs to be told.",1421971200,,652,4.396694214876033

2777180,5,B000NPO3D2,"Such a wonderful and touching story that also shows how we do not have to be like our parents, that what our biological families chose to do is not what we ""have"" to chose.  This is also so beautiful as it shows the healing power of forgiveness and love to a soul who was in no way responsible, but carried the guilt from her parents actions. And the healing power of love to the victims who suffered horribly at the hand of her parents.",1414540800,,437,4.2023809523809526

2777183,2,B000NPO3D2,"It is biographical and not an everyday movie. It is about a jewish woman who survived being in a camp as a child as she was taken as a servant to a tyrant, the camp Commondant. She was mistreated there by this man and was given nothing and allowed to do nothing. And the one childhood friend she had was shot by this tyrant to assure she had nothing. But...the reason for the movie too, was the meeting of the Jewish woman with the daughter of the camp Commondant. The daughter grew up knowing little of her father, llived with her grandmother and shielded from the holocaust. You need to be patient to watch and you will begin to understand her side also. For them to meet one another is emotional for both. They'll never be friends by the daughter learned a lot.",1412380800,,764,4.34965034965035

2777187,5,B000NPO3D2,"Fantastic! This was so educationally and personal to watch. My gosh, both these women were so brave to take this journey together to discuss the horrors of that place and time. I felt for both women but I think Monika's journey was just so unique in that for her it really as she said the beginning of her understanding and probably her deep pain. I am also glad that the victim  Helen was able to get closure and share this experience w/ her daughter so that the next generation truly understood the hell their mother lived. Very difficult to watch but very eye opening.",1410307200,,571,4.490384615384615

2777189,5,B000NPO3D2,"This movie was powerful and hard to watch. Monika, Amon's daughter, truly struggles with overwhelming guilt and pain related to the horrible acts of her father whom she never knew. When she meets with the Jewish maid that served in Amon's house it is both sad and overwhelming to watch. The abuse that the maid went through was horrific and Monika tries to understand but cannot fully take it all in. This movie shows the life long impacts on both the abused parties and the parties living with the family guilt. I highly recommend it but it is not an easy watch.",1409011200,,563,4.529411764705882

2777191,5,B000NPO3D2,"The film struck me as captivating, confronting, and thought-provoking, from start to finish.

2777194,5,B000NPO3D2,Moved me to tears. A chilling glimpse into history and into the horrors of a war that ended just a few years before I was born. The pain that these women expressed was palpable. May we never forget.,1405814400,,198,4.2368421052631575
2777195,5,B000NPO3D2,"Compelling story and while not a high dollar film, the ethical and moral issues of war and those who suffer long after the battles are over, are something we as reasonable human beings should be compelled to learn and address.",1405641600,,226,4.675

After film was over, keeps you thinking about how devastating and sad for the both for their entire lives.

2777202,5,B000NPO3D2,I watched this film and feel great appreciation for the effort extended in its making and the honesty within.

2777211,5,B000NPO3D2,"This film exposes the audience to a viewpoint not commonly seen in Holocaust materials: how does the child of a perpetrator react to learning that truth? Monica gives us a window on the post-war Germany that wanted to hide from the Holocaust; she puts her horror to work and bravely risks inviting Helena to meet her at Plaszow. For all her lack of comprehension, she remains somewhat heroic as she attempts to raise her grandson with the values and respect of a more tolerant world.",1401753600,,483,4.694117647058824

2777213,5,B000NPO3D2,The pain of both women involved was very sobering to view.  The German lady is very clearly struggling with the memories of her father - who could bear to have such an inheritance?  The Jewish lady was absolutely traumatised by her experience and her own children had inherited this from her. This was a wonderful documentary but the tears flow freely when watching.,1401667200,,366,4.7936507936507935

2777219,5,B000NPO3D2,"It must have taken a lot of strength for Helen to return to Poland; and it must have taken a lot of strength for Monika to face Helen and the place where her father murdered so many innocents.

They each had to face the most central events in their lives, events which took the lives of their parents, inescapable and harsh central parts of themselves.

The past is never past.  The actions taken by Amon Goeth (and those like him) continued to haunt both families.  Helen's husband eventually committed suicide because he was so haunted by the Holocaust; so did Monika's mother, Ruth, as the wife of the SS Amon Goeth.  And Monika's daughter (Goeth's granddaughter) developed addiction problems so severe that she was removed from her baby, and Monika and her husband are raising the little boy (Goeth's great-grandson).  Helen's three children are without their father, and so teh grandchildren are without their grandfather.

Even Goeth's great-grandson is still living in the pain caused by his great-grandfather; he is without his own mother.

The pain that was caused was still there.  The ripples flowed across time and across the people.

I am so glad that these two women, from their disparate places in life, could come together, to responsibly answer those most serious and personal of questions:  ""How did this happen?  What motivated the individuals responsible?  How could this happen?  Why?  What is my role in this?  How can I make sure that it does not happen again?""

They took the entire meeting and all of the events very personally and responsibly.  They owned it.

It was also interesting to see the factual tie-ins of Oskar Schindler.

Notably, Amon Goeth was not executed for his mass murder of thousands Jews, but for betraying the SS by stealing the wealth of Jews for his own personal stash.

I am grateful to Helen and Monika for trying to move forward and be good wives, mothers, and grandmothers.

The lesson (and there are many):  regardless of what has occurred, we must be strong and move forward as loving people who bring joy to our children.

It is a good way of thinking about oneself.  We think of ourselves in this moment; but, what we choose to do flows through our children and into our great-grandchildren.

Our lives may be short, but our decisions, good or bad, loving or unloving, are very lasting.",1399852800,4,2343,4.795

2777235,5,B000NPO3D2,"This was a very tastefully produced documentary.

It was brave of Helen (who was Goeth's house maid at a tender age of 14 years-old) and her daughter Vivian to meet with Monika (Goeth's daughter).

Helen could not forget her past...who could under those circumstances? Monika, in turn, is trying to understand her own history that was hidden from her. Helen appears to come away stronger and resolved. Monika, looks almost kid like and fragile, a foreigner in a foreign land, yet so distinctly linked to her.

It was witnessing a very private moment of two women linked by a horrible past, each with many loose ends this life can never bind. Helen lost her family, boyfriend, and later, even her own husband to the lasting memories of the Holocaust. Monika, her father, and later, her mother who also couldn't escape the Holocaust.

Can relate to both in a different way, as my mom was a Japanese national who was about Helen's age when the war ended. Although she didn't live in a concentration camp, she knew about starvation and the senselessness of wanton violence, and the powerlessness when criminals dictate. She would have nightmares of that time all her life (frightening to see), and judged by people solely due to her nationality. It was so unfair, yet no matter how I tried to protect my mom of that unfairness, I could never fully relate to really save her from the ghosts of WWII...I wasn't there. For that I relate to Monika (and Vivian), wanting to know what did happen but not being there to truly know, and that final closure will always escape me more so when mom passed away.

It's the living that suffer, it's the living that bear the burden to remember and to teach others of the very painful past.

We really should research more of our ancestry to assist ourselves and our physicians with what problems we are having or can have with our health.  I know it saved my life with being the only one in the world with a rare muscle condition.  DNA helps but the expense for many is not justifiable, when all we have to do his look to our Family Tree to understand better what we can find to make our lives a better quality for our future.  This Documentary shows us what so many Jewish people did to find their loved ones, who had been murdered by the Nazis during World War II and that they carry with them, those who lived the regret that they were left behind and their parents, siblings and friends died horrific deaths at the hands of men, who were true Psychopaths of the worst kind, mainly Adolf Hitler.  Hitler was not a German, but born in Austria on April 20th 1889 in a small Austrian town called Braunau, near the German Boarder.  He died in 1945 in a bunker with his girlfriend Eva Braun.

This Documentary is a must see for young and old to realize what two woman did by coming together to help one another with the sins of ones father and the death of the others father.

2777301,5,B000NPO3D2,"This is a true story about two women dealing with immense pain and sadness. Helen is a concentration camp survivor and Monika is the daughter of the infamous Amon Goeth, Nazi commandant of Plaszow concentration camp. As a child, Monika does not know much about her father - just that he died when she was a baby. It's only as she gets older that she learns the truth about the horrific crimes he committed. In her search for more information about her father, she discovers Helen, a Jewish woman who had been Goeth's slave in the camp. The women begin communicating through letters and decide to meet at the Plaszow camp.

This film had me crying at several parts, the first being the phone call between Monika and Helen at the hotel in Krakow. It's interesting to see how both women express their emotions. Monika is very open, expressing her sadness and guilt, while Helen keeps her emotions more at bay. As the film goes on, Helen expresses more emotion as she relives her experiences at the camp. You really feel for both of them, and I cannot possibly fathom what they've been through.",1363132800,,1090,4.618556701030927
2777302,5,B000NPO3D2,"This is a documentary about two survivors of the Holocaust.  One woman, Helen Jonas, was a young girl in the Plaszow Concentration Camp, and the other woman is the daughter of the late Amon Goeth, who was the inhumane monster that ran the camp.

It is two totally different stories about survival.  Helen Jonas is actually a real life character in Schindler's List that was saved from certain death by basically being held as a domestic slave by Amon Goeth.

Monika Hertwig is the daughter, who through no fault of her own has paid for ""the sins of the father"" for over sixty years.  She was only three years old and not living at Krakow when all of the horrors were transpiring.

This is the story of these two amazingly strong women and their struggles with their pasts, and their victories of living.

Monika Hertwig never knew much about her father until 1993 when Schindler's List was released.  That movie was what opened her eyes to the history she was innocently part of and desperately wanted to know that she was in no way like her father.  As I watched her and listened to her speak, I saw a woman who was broken down by a past that she in no way had contributed to, except by being the recipient of a gene pool that she would have preferred never to been a part.

Helen Jonas suffered the consequences of being a young Jewish girl in a horrendous time in our history.  She lived through this physically, but now when she is I believe in her 70's still has and will always have the physical and mental scars that will remain with her throughout her life.

Monika reached out to Helen and wanted to meet her to get a better understanding of the true facts of the time, a true accounting of her father's brutality, and I believe wanted assurances that she was nothing like her father.

I know their are other documentaries on the children of the brutal Nazi monsters that I have yet to watch, but I have read extensively about these children and many of them as adults were voluntarily sterilized so that their gene pool would end, and there would be no chance of them passing on any of the traits of their parents.

I found myself with tears running down my face several times during this documentary because my heart broke for both women and for what each had suffered from the events of that time in history, and both were truly innocent victims of this atrocity.

The women eventually met at the site of the concentration camp and were able to talk with each other about the events of each of their lives.

I am glad I watched this, but it did leave me with very sad and empty feeling when it was over.  I think most people look only at the history and lives of the Jewish survivors.  This documentary delves into the other side of the coin, so to speak, and forces us to remember the innocents that have been caught up in this horror by no fault of their own.",1362787200,,2873,4.398865784499055

2777305,4,B000NPO3D2,"It is nice to know that the evil of the father is not necessarily passed on to his children - and in this case Monika is a very sensitive, compassionate woman who herself has done nothing to be ashamed of (as far as this topic goes), but every day she must face the fact that her father was a cruel monster who enjoyed hurting and killing Jews during WWII and who also profited greatly and illegally from it.  Her mother was also something of a piece of work. And it is the innocent daughter who spends her life paying for the sins of her parents.  Nobody ever thinks about that - about how the children of the monsters have to live with all this.

Still, the ""must see"" part of this is the story of Helen - what she went through, the people she lost, the terror and mistreatment she lived with and how -- after all this time, it effects her still.  The story of her husband's 35 years of daily mental torment AFTER this was all over with, until he finally couldn't take it any longer ----- THIS, THIS is the emotional glue that will hopefully make it stick in the minds of generations to come, how horrible and wrong and long lasting the ripples of evil are.  Hopefully, this will not be repeated if people can watch this and feel/see the pain and better understand the horror and how/why it was so wrong and that we should be ever vigilant against such bigotry, genocide, and violence, etc.

Helen's story is the reason to watch this - but I'm glad we also are made to see that it's not just the people we wronged (in this case the Jews) that are hurt - but also your own family that pay for your sins.  And it effects generations.",1362182400,,1633,4.26537216828479

2777312,5,B000NPO3D2,"How to imagine the strength to face the past, which forms so much of the present for both Helen and Monika? The scene in the villa was most heartbreaking:  Monika repeating the lies told to her by her mother whom she has struggled all her life to love juxtaposed against Helen's outrage in hearing the same lies that led to her horrendous experiences in the Holocaust.

You feel the shattering pain of the child in Monika trying to rectify the truth of Helen (and truths told by her} standing before Monika with the lies taught to her by her mother and the forming realization that her mother knew far much more.  Her father a monster, and her mother perhaps no less so.  Monika, now a grandmother still searching for who she is given her ""inheritance"".

Helen, while agreeing to meet Monika after Monika reaches out and writes to her is guarded.  There is a palpable undercurrent of rage in Helen, but an inexplicable determination.  In tears you glimpse only part of the terror of her youth experienced at the villa and at the hands of Monika's father.  There is much more to be told by Helen as to her experiences and later on she shares perhaps her most heart wrenching tale of loss.

The feeling is strong that Monika needs a warm hug from Helen - the reassurance that in spite of the evils of her parents - she is a good person and that those evils do not define her.  Helen, for the first time going back to the source of her terror is overwhelmed with those horrific memories (including Amon's slaying of her mother), is clearly and understandably torn.

I will be forever in awe of the survivors of the Holocaust.  How they managed to survive the unimaginable, and to go on and build lives, have families.... but I thank them for sharing their experiences.  This documentary presents a slightly different angle - that of the child of a Nazi monster who has amazingly developed a determination to know the truth.  Helen - the only one who can stand before Monika and cry ""lie"" based upon her first hand experiences - serves as fulfill the roll of ""truth-sayer"".

This film should be shown to psych students as a hideous example of transference/countertransference and projection. Indeed, some of the responses to this post are great examples of same. My post seems to have pushed a lot of buttons, but I learned long ago to get out of the way of the crossfire between a person and him-/herself, so I'm stepping aside and letting my detractors illustrate exactly what I'm saying better than I ever could.

Susanna was looking for someone to take blame, and she found it in Monika, who was looking for someone to blame her. A match made in heaven. Susanna has the whole world empathizing, sympathizing. Was it horrific? Of course. It was worse than unspeakable. But she has a form of comfort in her victimhood that Monika does not have. And Monika is a victim, too, because--and I can't overstate this--she didn't do anything. She doesn't need forgiveness. She was not a perpetrator. And despite everyone's insistence to the contrary, she is being treated like one, but she opened the door to this by offering herself up as a sacrificial lamb to Susanna, who got to spit, if not on THE perpetrator, on someone who looked just like him. In the scene where Susanna tears her a new one for saying what she had been told as a child, I did not see someone who actually believed it. I saw a person offering up the only, albeit feeble, explanation for her denial. I saw someone who was regressing to the person she was when she was told that stuff--a child--and was simply offering up an explanation as to why she had taken a lifetime to come to terms with the horror her father was. And she was coming to terms with it, as evidenced by her presence at the monument and in Susanna's company. But her psyche had protected her by giving her that ridiculous explanation. I think that she unfortunately came away with the undeserved blame she was seeking and went away full of ammunition with which to persecute herself for the rest of her days for something she DID NOT DO. A whole lot of reviewers of this movie say they understand that Monika was not the perpetrator, but underneath it all, on a deep level, everyone is treating her that way. In the end, Susanna doesn't need another person's compassion--she has the compassion of everyone who has ever, and who will ever, hear this story. Monika has no one's compassion, so that's who I'm giving mine to.",1358208000,91,2576,4.575757575757576
2777317,5,B000NPO3D2,"Apparently the Germans have a word that literally means ""Grandfather + fear + WWII"", meaning the fear they feel when they wonder what their relatives did during the Holocaust. War Criminal Amon Goeth's daughter Monika, who slowly learned of her legacy as an adolescent, seems to vacillate between resigned acceptance of a horrible truth and occasional lapses of childlike naivete. In one strange scene at the Villa where her father imprisoned Helen, the survivor she later meets, Monika seems to go back into the bubble of denial that she must've been raised in as she surprisingly tells Helen of some rationalization for why her father killed only 'certain' people - some contamination theory (?) - which only sounds just as antisemitic anyway so it doesn't really make sense. Helen has to snap her out of this denial and make her face the ugly reality that she still seems to struggle with.

We also see the irreversible damage done when Helen talks about her husband. That scene was possibly the most heartbreaking, as she lost her father, her teenage boyfriend, and ultimately her husband to the Nazis. Others have asked whether she can forgive or not, which to me seems like an almost insulting question. It reminds me of how Sister Mary Prejean later regretted asking the parents of a raped and murdered woman if they could forgive the killer- the audacity of that just enrages me. Why do people think there is going to be some kind of nice happy ending to a tragic event? Why do they expect some kind of 'group hug' type of moment?!! Yes, there are some people who do forgive (often for spiritual reasons) but to expect it of people is kind of galling, I think. People are entitled to their anger, after all, in these circumstances, they are usually left with little else to soldier on with.

A couple of interesting things that I wondered about that are unexplored tangents-- since these legacies can affect generations, it's interesting that Helen's daughter appears well-adjusted, yet Monika's daughter is an addict unable to care for her baby. Helen seems quite strong, albeit scarred- understandably- but quite resilient. Yet Monika seems rather fragile and at times childlike. As Helen said, she had to grow up at 14 and learn to survive- yet one gets the sense that Monika was probably more withdrawn into a fantasy world of how things were, and perhaps was even encouraged to do so by her mother and others to deny reality. At times, she appears to be slowly coming out of that fantasy world. Given the real one, I can understand why she'd want to live in that world.

A couple of strange things about the Villa at the camp- I wondered if it was actually occupied- at first it appears abandoned, but as they make their way into the kitchen, it appears inhabited. I hope it's just a historically preserved site and not a residence, because that would be really disturbing. Also, the photos are unnerving as one minute we see Goeth on the porch with a rifle (Helen said he would often shoot people in the mornings, first thing, as if he couldn't wait to start killing people), then you see Monika's mother Ruth sunning herself, smiling, or other folks lounging, relaxed and content. That coexistence of psychopathy and everyday non-chalance is so chilling and strange. As if it was all the same as plowing the fields or fishing...this was always one of the mysteries of this kind of phenomenon. How mass murder could be so casually dealt with. Which also brings up the issue of Monika and her mother; Helen says, and  I think accurately so, that Monika seems to have decided and/or accepted that her father was a monster but can't forgive her mother for loving him anyway and sitting by while it all happened. Also, since she knew her mother, she could see her as a human being, but her father could remain an abstract representation of evil, not a parent that she was bonded to (he was executed).

This was a very moving film and reminded me how much closer these memories are than I realize; since I was born in 65 this era seems like another world to me, and I'm not related to any survivors, so it can feel remote to me. One of the saddest parts is learning about Helen's husband who never recovered from his memories and took his own life.

2777325,5,B000NPO3D2,"Happened upon this on Netflix and watched it out of curiousity. The story was fascinating. Unlike other reviewers, I did not feel more sympathetic towards Monika, in fact I found her a bit strange. I felt she seemed very unaware of what went on during the holocaust, and some of the things she said to Helen were very inappropriate  - such as telling her ""I was told the Jews were killed because they were dirty and diseased"". Even if she was told that, she should know better by now, and should have never have said something like that to someone who suffered so much.
Does Helen come off as the more cold of the two? Yes, of course. She was taught at a very young age that showing emotion can get you killed. How was she supposed to react to the daughter of her tormenter? Treat her like a long-lost sister? I thought it was incredibly generous of her to meet her at all. Of course Monika is not her father, but it would be very hard not to look at her and see the man that murdered thousands.",1330041600,5,995,4.264550264550264
2777326,5,B000NPO3D2,"It is rare to experience a film with this much power. This one will cut you to the core. Yet, whatever pain you feel for these two ladies, you know it is NOTHING compared to what they have endured.

What of Helen Jonas? This outwardly normal lady is shown to have developed some amazing skills in suppressing the horror of her youth. As I type these words, I know each one is a complete waste of time because THERE ARE NO WORDS that can sufficiently describe what she has experienced---and the subsequent pain of having to live with it. And as if that wasn't quite enough, she has the added pleasure of watching her husband be tormented to death by mental anguish. Yet she still smiles and loves life. Amazing.

Then there is Monika Hertwig. She hurts too. Yes, it cannot possibly be the same level of pain as Helen's, but it is pain nevertheless; and it is heartbreaking to see her attempt to find meaning in it all. Can any of us begin to imagine seeing your Father portrayed in Schindler's List and knowing full well that is it THE TRUTH? Surely the bottom fell out from under Monika's life that day.

Although, at the end, I felt somewhat better that each lady found some degree of closure, it did open a Pandora's box of troubling questions: Life. What is it? Why are we here? Why do so many suffer? Why do we continue the insanity of bearing children? Why are some blessed at birth in timing, location, good parents; while others are brought into the world under a curse, such as being born a European Jew who had to suffer through the War? Nobody knows. Nobody will ever know. We are just...HERE.

One thing is certain though. World War II was the single biggest cataclysm in human history. This film centers on but two ladies who are still reeling from that war 65 years after the fact! There are still millions alive who suffer just like they do. Never forget.

This is an awesome film. Please see it!",1328832000,,1910,4.445714285714286

(Ms. Jonas-Rosenzweig was also interviewed for the extra features of the Schindler's List DVD.) These two women had great courage to allow themselves to be filmed as each step of their meeting unfolded. James Moll, the director, was also the director of The Last Days, another exceptional film.",1266537600,2,588,5.26595744680851
2777331,5,B000NPO3D2,This is the most heart wrenching story I have read or heard about. I had such sympathy for Monika Herting.  She never had the suport group to help her through her terrible times where as Helen Rosenzweig did have emotional help when she needed it. Helen carried carried such a heavy burden for years. Sins of the father is never the fault of the children. Helen is now talking to young people and doing charity work through different outlets. She is to be admired and loved for her courage. Helen was not as warm towards Monika as I would have liked. No one is holier than thou.,1266364800,4,578,4.401869158878505
2777332,4,B000NPO3D2,"Monika Hertwig is the reason to see ""Inheritance."" She comes across as a very real, lovely woman, someone you'd like to have as a friend or next door neighbor. She's a grandmother and housewife, in her sixties, very tall and slim. She's sensitive and caring. She's also the daughter of Amon Goeth, the commandant of Plaszow, the Nazi concentration camp depicted in ""Schindler's List."" In that film, Ralph Fiennes played Monika's father. Monika was born in 1945. Goeth was executed in 1946.

Monika reports how she learned, slowly but surely, as a child, who her father was and what he did. Monika contacted Helen Jonas, who, as a child, had been one of two Jewish woman named Helen who had served as Goeth's slaves in his Plaszow home. Jonas lived in New Jersey. Monika and Helen met at the site of the Plaszow concentration camp, and James Moll filmed their meeting.

As several viewers have noted, Monika comes across as the more sympathetic of the two women. Monika allows her emotions to show. She weeps profusely when meeting Helen and appears to be approaching Helen for a hug. Helen rebuffs her. It is clear that Helen was severely hurt by her childhood experiences, and has never fully recovered. She still views the world as hostile, even when it is not. Monika is not an enemy. It is her profound misfortune to be the biological child of a very evil man, but she herself is not evil. One would have liked to have seen Helen express the forgiveness for which Monika so obviously hungers.

Monika never knew her father, and comes to know him from others' accounts, including Spielberg's and Fiennes' depiction of Goeth in ""Schindler's List."" Helen fleshes out the depiction. Goeth pushed Helen, a mere child, down the stairs in his home several times. He knew that Helen, his little slave, had a boyfriend, Adam. One day Goeth teasingly asked Helen where Adam was, and, then, within minutes, shot Adam. Goeth kept two large dogs at Plaszow. He trained them to maul and kill human victims. He robbed Jews before killing them. Monika has a cigarette case from her father. She suspected that he stole it from one of his Jewish victims.

Most mysterious is Monika's mother, Ruth Kalder. No one in the documentary mentions it, but, weirdly, Ruth looks Jewish; certainly her features are those that Nazis would identify as Jewish. She had abundant, striking black hair and a prominent nose, which Monika inherited. In one photo, Ruth looks very much like Chico Marx. This is not a wisecrack, but a statement of fact. It's more than a little odd that Goeth would select a girl who looked so Jewish, even as he sent thousands of Jews to their deaths for their allegedly obvious ""racial inferiority,"" a racial inferiority that was supposed to be obvious in their dark Semitic features, allegedly so different from blond Aryan superiority. One has to ask, why did Ruth love Goeth? The documentary does not probe this pressing question.

""Inheritance"" includes archival film footage of the actual execution, by hanging, of Amon Goeth. It was a grotesque event. Hangmen need to know their physics. Length of rope and drop must be calculated to produce a clean death. The masked executioners in Poland tried to kill Goeth two times before getting it right on the third try. The viewer may question why it is important to view this spectacle of death.

I would like to have seen some harder questions asked of each character. Monika: Point blank, did you inherit any of your father's evil? Where did that evil come from? Where did it go? Is he in hell? Can God ever forgive men like Amon Goeth? What would you do if you were God? Would you send your father to hell forever? If not, why not?

Helen: Will you ever be able to forgive? Will you ever be able to move on? Will you always be stuck in victim mode? Why are you so harsh with Monika?

What about Helen's children? I would have liked to have heard more about their experience of being children of survivors. I would have liked to have seen some depth given to Poland. The bulk of this film was shot in Poland. There were Germans and Jews but there were Polish victims and heroes and perpetrators as well. Poland isn't even background in this doc and that is a failing. Two suicides and one drug addiction are mentioned, but not explored. In short, I was very moved by this documentary, but I would like to have seen it go deeper into the very big questions it touches on.",1256428800,5,4422,4.6530089628681175
2777333,4,B000NPO3D2,This is a unique documentary on a touching subject matter giving a rare opportunity to get in touch with the individuals experiences and memmories of the holocaust from two very different positions. Well worth watching.,1247529600,,219,5.285714285714286
2777334,5,B000NPO3D2,"I have to say that I admire Monika, and I suppose she could have grown up admiring and worshipping her father and the Nazi dogma, like so many perpetrators' children have done.  However, when she said to the producer of this film ""I am not my father,"" there was never a more true statement. It must be so difficult for someone to find out that they are the child of a mass murderer.  One can either live in denial and embrace their parents for the life they led under the Third Reich, or they can admonish it, and acknowledge the evil that Nazism was and is. I think the latter is more difficult for these children of Nazis.

It's not so much the fact that Monika has come to terms with what her infamous father did, but the fact that she was confused and horrified to know that her mother did nothing, and stood by Amon Goeth's side and loved the man.  Afterall, it was her mother Ruth, that she grew up and lived with.  Amon was executed when she was a baby.  Even Helen Jonas wanted to understand what could make the man so evil.

As for poor Helen, the Holocaust is something that will never leave her and has affected her family, even many years after her liberation.  It has also affected Monika. We have heard the horrible testimony of Holocaust survivors, and the stories never leave you.  However, the difference with this film and the survivor testimonies is the fact that here are two women, both living on opposite sides of the coin, and both wanted to understand what is probably incomprehensible as the horrors of the Holocaust, to which Amon Goeth fully and happily participated.

From a psychological perspective, this film is extremely fascinating.",1246579200,2,1665,4.557046979865772
2777335,4,B000NPO3D2,"In director James Moll's ""Inheritance"", we are introduced to two women who have something in common - they are both connected to an infamous war criminal, Amon Goeth, commandant of Plaszow concentration camp during WW II, who was eventually hanged for war crimes.

Monika Hertwig was Amon Goeth's daughter and only child, though she never knew her father since she was born just before he was hanged. Despite this relative unfamiliarity with her own father, Hertwig is very much affected by his actions, carrying the burden of guilt all these years. Her most intense impression of him is Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Amon in the movie ""Schindler's List."" When Hertwig sees an interview with Helen Jonas on television, a Jewish woman and former Plaszow inmate who had been a slave worker in Amon Goeth's household during the war, she decides to meet her to get a better understanding of who her father really was.

The documentary shows viewers these two women's journey - Hertwig from Germany and Jonas from New Jersey to the site of the Plaszow camp. Their meeting is poignant for all the raw emotions it stirs up in both women. Helen Jonas' anger and sorrow at what was done to her and other innocents is evident, but she also shows compassion towards Monika Hertwig who ironically appears to be the more vulnerable of the two, a rather bewildered expression on her face as she listens to Jonas' recounting the events of the past.

Both women are ultimately victims of a ruthless and merciless man, though they have been affected in different ways. Monika Hertwig is the daughter who struggles to understand what kind of man her father was and why he did what he did, carrying the burden of her father's sins. Helen Jonas not only suffered untold depravity during WW II, but continued to suffer through the years, struggling to come to terms with all the horrors she and others endured during those terrible times.

There are some extras on this DVD: a 5 min interview with the director and cinematographer, ""Behind the Score"" where the viewer gets a look at the actual recording of the score, a bio of the director etc. I would highly recommend this documentary to those who are interested in the Holocaust.",1240012800,16,2209,4.79002624671916
2777336,5,B000NPO3D2,"""Inheritance""  is a documentary that tells the story of two women with very different scars from the World War II genocide of European Jews.

Now in her 60's, Monika Hertwig has struggled a lifetime with what she learned at age 11 -- that her father, Amon Goeth, had not been killed in World War II like other soldiers, but was hanged as a war criminal when she was a baby.  Over the years, she forced herself to learn more about Amon, but when Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" came out in 1993, Monika became sick with the truth.

Helen Jones was 15 years old when she arrived with other Jews at the Plaszow Camp in Poland, which was both a work camp and a death camp.  She was singled out by Amon Goeth to live in his house as a servant.  Decades after the Holocaust, Helen's appearance in a German television documentary captured Monika's attention, and the two women arranged to meet at the Plaszow concentration camp memorial to the thousands who died there.

Director James Moll (""The Last Days"") tells a fascinating story of the effect of the Holocaust on two individuals decades later.  We see Monika's compulsion to learn more about her father, a man she had never known, and the pain with which she learns the extent of her father's crimes.  The documentary also shows the power of film to move people.  It was Ralph Fiennes' chilling portrayal of Amon Goeth in the Spielberg film that motivated Goeth's daughter to come to terms with the kind of man her father was.",1231632000,33,1481,4.596958174904943
2777337,5,B000NPO3D2,I watched this film several times because I was so moved by it.  I think it is an important and excellent piece of work.,1229472000,,120,4.0
2777338,4,B000NPO3D2,"Monika is the real-life daughter of Amon Goth, the infamous commandant of the Plaszow concentration camp and a main subject of the ""Schindler's List."" Monika, a tall, rangy and emotionally fragile woman, has spent a lifetime coming to terms with the monster who was her father. In his film, she arranges to meet Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, who along with her own mother was employed as a cook by Goth at Plaszow. The women hope for a cathartic encounter that will purge them of their shame and horror.

Oddly, Monika comes off as the more sympathetic of the two women. Her emotions are raw, unhealed and close to the surface. Helen has lived for years with the effects of the cruelty experienced and witnessed at the camp, and her story is smoother for frequent repetition. Both women clearly are victims, and both bear the scars and shame of the past. I felt viscerally how passing through the Holocaust changed lives forever, despite the passage of decades. And I saw how the evil of the fathers is visited on future generations.

The film is generally easy to watch, with many Goth family photos interspersed with photos of Jews being herded onto tricks or marched off to work. An exception is a graphic filmed execution, which though bloodless, is affecting. Such such footage is rarely seen on sanitized American television.

The subtext of ""Inheritance"" is a meditation on the question of evil. How could the serene and sensitive Monika have been sired by one of the twentieth century's more brutal villains?  Her story shows that biology need NOT be destiny. What remains unanswered at the end of the documentary is the question of how Goth's soul became so twisted. Fans of the movie will be interested to see how well Steven Spielberg rendered the Goth villa, Schindler's factory and other landmarks.",1228953600,78,1805,4.869706840390879
8180463,4,B000NPO3D2,"This was such an amazing documentary and is such an eyeopener offering great insight! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 though is because when the two women (Monika and Helen) arrive at the villa, you really only hear Helen's story because she doesn't even allow Monika to speak. It would have been nice to hear what Monika had to say and hear her express more of her emotions as well, but you don't get to experience any of that. Pretty disappointing. Maybe they should have had the two women enter the villa separately first and explore their stories and feelings, then, afterward, have them come together inside the villa? Instead you get Monika attempting to add something at one point, and Helen not allowing her to get a sentence in. Not saying that its not 100% understandable of course that Helen was overwhelmed with emotion and didn't really want to hear anything in the moment (which will have you close to tears). I blame this on the creators of the documentary for not thinking about that ahead of time I guess. But that's really my only complaint. Other than that, this documentary was really great and definitely worth watching!!! It makes you feel for both sides. Especially when Monika talks about the hanging of her father (Warning: Its shown in the film), the suicide of her mother...and the story about the cufflinks broke my heart. A monster? Yes, he was, but she was not born with the capability to choose her parents obviously. How tragic to have to live with having to view your parent as a monster, have that in the way of your love for him, and live with knowing what he did to people. This film will open your eyes to the tragedy experienced to this day by both sides!

8180468,5,B000NPO3D2,"""Inheritance"" is brutally honest, compelling documentary that cannot be viewed with indifference. The DVD centers upon Monika Hertwig , a woman who was raised to believe that her father was a ""good"" German soldier who was killed in action at the end of World War II. The idealized image of her father was shattered forever, when she realized that the sadistic Nazi commandant portrayed in ""Schindler's List"" was her very own father, Amon Goeth. Feeling a profound sense of shame, Monika contacts a survivor of the Plaszow Concentration Camp, Helen Jonas, who was enslaved as Amon Goeth's housekeeper. Following the passage of some sixty years, Monika meets Helen for the first time and learns more disturbing details about the father he had so idealized. This documentary will certainly stimulate much reflection on the nature of evil and the indellible mark it leaves in its wake, even after the passage of many decades.",1462492800,,921,5.065789473684211
