Oh well....it's one of my passions anyway.

The movie itself is an excellent documentary about the life of Ramses the Great and it really focuses on his first born son Amun-her-khepeshef, and was he really killed by the last plague of Egypt when the Hebrew's fled Egypt.
The filmmakers come to some interesting conclusions.
The thing that surprised me the most was the fact that the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten was the one who introduced the first monotheistic religion not the Hebrew's which is the widely held belief.

Morgan Freeman narrates and he is absolutely perfect in every way.
The only reason I'm not giving five stars is the ""field researcher"" who ran about from one location to another making what are claimed to be ""discoveries"" are in fact not discoveries at all made by him but are just common knowledge that has been around for a while. The Red Sea infact being The Reed Sea is one fine example.
Still, his running about at least adds a little excitement.

The directing, the reenactments are well done by the actors playing the biblical and historical figures.
The sound track is done well and doesn't distract from the experience.
All in all a top notch documentary.
I highly recommend this film for those who are interested in the time period and for those looking for more insight into the Exodus than what the bible provides

Highly Recommended.",1269388800,,1533,4.773584905660377
