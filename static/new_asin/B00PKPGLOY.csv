6815217,5,B00PKPGLOY,"This is by far one of the best TV series to come out in a long time. This period drama takes place in 1953 (post-war) Australia where scars and wounds are still vividly fresh in everyones minds but are not discussed. The story about the Bligh family is compelling but what truly marks this series as special is the interaction of the actors who are all equally superb in their roles. We actually viewed Season 1 on Acorn tv in the US and saw Season 2 it in the UK at some crazy afternoon time slot but it was well worth viewing. Two more series are commissioned which my husband and I eagerly anticipate, wish we had more of these types of series in the US...the Australians are producing several good series another not to miss is Dr. Blake.",1419465600,17,742,4.345323741007194
6815218,5,B00PKPGLOY,"This is one of the best series to come out of Australia in many years. The attention to details is remarkable. Channel 7 who produce it saw fit to cancel it halfway through season two and there was such an outcry that Fox picked it up for two more season. When you watch season two you can see how they tried to wrap most of the threads up but there were still unanswered question. Watch for Noni Hazelhurst, as the matriarch of the clan. She is so amazing that you hate her and admire her all at the same time. Stellar performances from all involved.",1419033600,42,551,4.257142857142857
6815219,5,B00PKPGLOY,"This is incredibly good. The acting, characters, complexity of motivations, personal histories, and global issues of the day all conspire to make for great drama. That said, if you are looking for fast-action, quick camera cuts, or loud soundtracks, this is not for you.

I found it mesmerizing.

The Australian accents are easy to understand.

Now might be a great time to check out Acorn TV. I pay $5 for their streaming service and it offers up some of the best quality fare available.",1418515200,36,488,4.785714285714286
6815220,5,B00PKPGLOY,"This show is awesome!  It's streaming on Acorn. I watched the whole thing in a few days.  It's a very interesting story with very believable acting.  It's also beautifully filmed with great period music and really draws you in.  Story is about a nurse who goes back to Australia after being in Europe for 20 years, through the Spanish Civil War and WWII. She is working on the ship she's returning on and meets up with this wealthy Australian family on their way back from England fresh with Grandmother, who is the most manipulative person you ever met.  Then comes her son, whose wife has died prior and his two children, one a young man with his new  English bride and his sister.  That's as much as I can say without giving away stuff.  Then there are the people you meet back on land.  The year is 1953.  The story is warm and not at all what I would have expected on any level. Life is very different. There's secrets within secrets.  Every episode is a cliffhanger, so you're on to he next one before you know what's happening.  Just like a good book. Save this one for a nice rainy or snowy weekend when you can curl up with a nice bowl of soup and work your way through it.  You won't be sorry.  Can't wait for Season 2.  I understand it premiere's in Australia this year.",1418083200,107,1281,4.323529411764706

6815238,4,B00PKPGLOY,"This has been called Downton Down Under but it is more The Thorn Birds meets As the World Turns.  It is a family drama set in Australia a little after the War in the 1950s.  The central characters are Sarah Adams and Elizabeth Bligh.  Sarah (Marta Dusseldorp) is a nurse who is moving to Australia from Europe.  Sarah converted to Judaism there (a subject of grave concern to her dying mother) and is trying to start a new life in a small town not too far from Sydney called Inverness.  The local monster does not swim in lochs; she dominates the sheep ranch/mansion/estate owned by the Bligh family.  The family matriarch (played to a fare thee well by Noni Hazlehurst) is a domineering, imperious, grotesquely unpleasant control freak.  Those she seeks to control include her son George, his son James (and new English wife, Olivia) and her granddaughter Anna.  (Her daughter Carolyn has escaped from the family and lives her own life in Sydney.)  She also seeks to control all of the local ranchers, the people who live in the town and, in her heart of hearts, everyone on the continent and a few people back in England and on the European mainland.

Sarah has sailed from England on the same ship as the Blighs (not an auspicious name for those traveling by sea) and saved son James from leaping overboard in an attempt to quell his homosexual inclinations.  He is not the only Bligh with issues.  Anna, e.g., is in love with a local Italian boy named Gino who works his familys vineyards.  The family is indebted to the Blighs and, thus, potentially manipulated by Elizabeth.  James is trying to be a good husband even though he has an eye for sweaty farmhands.  Olivia is trying to carve out some personal space from Elizabeth.  George is developing feelings for Sarah, as is the local doctor for whom she works.  He is also indebted to the Blighs and entangled in their family for reasons that are made clear at the end of the first season.  There is also a semicomic townie named Doris Collins who can spread gossip faster than the Associated Press (with whom Sarah lodges for a very brief time).

Enter into this mix a second monster named Regina Standish.  Aunt Reggie is the sister of Georges dead wife.  She too has been widowed and she comes to the Bligh manse at Elizabeths behest in order to lure George into her personal spider web.  She also serves as Elizabeths principal spy/evil servant/factotum.  She is willing to do, literally, anything to destroy Sarah and her relationship with George.  She makes Iago look like a BFF.  She is also flagrantly anti-semitic and greets Sarah by saying things like Ah, the Jew! in an oily, evil fashion.  She also has a number of good things to say about the Fhrer and his plans and methods.

Some of the acting is exquisite, some bordering on the execrable.  That is in part due to the hyperbolic script that creates a number of moments that look more like an SNL parody of a soap opera than an actual story line.  Nevertheless, the story is riveting, in part because there is so much drama and so much melodrama (the latter word used by Elizabeth in characterizing Reggies machinations).

Bottom line: this is, at times, way, way, way over the top and yet it seizes the attention, the emotions and the sense of curiosity and will not let go.  It is the type of drama in which you end up talking to the television set and deciding that yes, it is 3:30 a.m. but lets just watch one more episode.",1518220800,3,3450,4.570032573289902

6815241,1,B00PKPGLOY,"*Warning: spoilers*

I'm not even done with the first season, and it feels like it's already been three seasons. I've still got three more episodes to watch, but why bother?

It boggles my mind that some people have said that ""A Place to Call Home"" is as good as ""Downton Abbey"". Don't get me wrong; ""Downton Abbey"" had its bad moments, but to compare it to this is just insulting. It's like comparing a Disney animated feature to a cheap foreign knock-off of it.

It really says a lot about the other characters on this show when the only characters I'm still interested in are Elizabeth and Olivia Bligh. Elizabeth may be written as a tyrant, but she actually has a character arc and emotional struggles, plus a modicum of intelligence, plus better lines than anyone else. Plus I couldn't help feeling some pity for her after she had her heart attack. Olivia is a homophobe and has shown a vicious streak, but again, she has a character arc. Emotional struggles. Why is making their characters act like actual human beings so hard for the show's writers?

Half the problems on this show come from characters making stupid decisions and not communicating. Anna's pregnancy is a perfect example. After a trip to the city to get a gynecological exam and a diaphragm, she just randomly decides not to use the diaphragm, because she thinks it's too invasive. Sure enough, she gets pregnant. What did she think would happen? And why a diaphragm? Birth control pills did exist in the 1950s. And why wasn't her boyfriend, Gino, wearing a condom? And why this elaborate charade with the guy Elizabeth wants her to marry? Why hasn't she told  Gino about her pregnancy? Come to think of it, why don't she and Gino just elope, if they really love each other and want to get married that much?

Random bully (I honestly don't remember his name, he's such a stock character) goes around town making trouble. He beats his girlfriend, even causing her to give birth prematurely, tries to beat up Gino, and disrupts a peace talk with some Japanese diplomats. Do the good characters call the police? Do they try to get his girlfriend and child away from him? Nope, they just beat him up and humiliate him in public! Great job, guys: your probably just made things worse for his wife and child, since it's likely he'll be taking out all his anger and humiliation on them. Look, I know things weren't great for abused women, and especially not in conservative country towns. But this guy is just such a ridiculous caricature: he might as well be twirling a black mustache and tying women to train tracks. The fact that no one really does anything about him makes the characters look stupid or heartless or both.

But all this stupidity is nothing compared to the very worst part of the show: our heroine, Sarah Adams. This character is boring, annoying, and horribly-written. She could have been interesting. She has an intriguing past, after all: she served as a nurse in the Spanish-American war, she was born as a Catholic but converted to Judaism when she married a Jewish man, and she even suffered two years in a concentration camp.

And none of that ever comes up in the show, except when the writers throw it in for mystery or angst or to make her look like a persecuted saint.

The fact that she's a Jewish convert is especially insulting, because it has no effect on her character. None. We never see her practicing Judaism: nothing about keeping kosher, or reading the Torah, or regretting that there's no synagogue in the town, or even celebrating the high holidays, except Yom Kippur. And no practicing Jew would behave the way this woman does on Yom Kippur. She drinks beer, when you're supposed to fast. She reads a book of her husband's poems, when if she were really devout, she would be reading the Torah or praying. She immerses herself in a Mikvah beforehand, when only men do it before Yom Kippur.

By the way, I checked the internet to get my facts straight about Yom Kippur. It took me barely two minutes. Apparently, the writers of ""A Place to Call Home"" couldn't even do that. Or, more likely, they just didn't care.

So much for Sarah's supposed Judaism: what about her trauma from the war and the concentration camp? Well, it really only exists at the beginning, when the writers are trying to build up the mystery around her. After that, it pretty much vanishes, except when the show uses it in a cheap bid for sympathy. I wanted to throw something at the screen. This woman spent time in a CONCENTRATION CAMP! Her husband DIED in a concentration camp! This should be a HUGE part of her character! She should be battling God knows how many personal demons!

But no: the biggest threat on the show comes from Elizabeth, and the town's small-minded gossips, and Regina. Oh, dear God, Regina. This is a character who has no other purpose than to torment Sarah and her boring boyfriend. I mean it. Elizabeth actually telephones her and asks her to come to town and split George and Sarah up. Which she does, because she's an anti-Semite (naturally), and she wants to marry George herself (of freakin' course). Her so-called ""scheming"" is so pathetic that Eddard Stark could see through it. Generally, characters who are successful manipulators hide their true purpose and pretend to befriend the person they're manipulating, but not Regina. Regina actually GREETS Sarah by saying, ""Ah, the Jew!"" when they meet for the first time. Seriously. Not even Donald Trump would be that blatantly racist.

And this character is the true threat on the show. This is the main conflict that our two leads will have to face. I don't know which character will look worse by the end. Regina, because she's such a caricature? Or George, for actually LISTENING to Regina and believing her lies?

Just think about this for a minute. Our heroine survived a war and a concentration camp, where her husband was murdered. And her main enemies are not her memories of the Nazis, not her feelings of guilt about her husband's death, not even a German character, but...a tyrannical old woman, a bunch of small-minded hicks, and a petty anti-Semite. Did no one working on this show see how ridiculous this all is?

Sarah comes to town showing the same disdain for the common folk that Bella Swan showed in Twilight. She never tries to make friends with anyone. She shuns the town's social events. She antagonizes her landlady, even in the beginning, when the landlady is trying to be friendly. I thought she was tiresome in the beginning, but I excused her, because I thought it was due to trauma from the war. Nope. It would make more sense for the townspeople to dislike Sarah, not because she's (supposedly) a convert to Judaism, but because she's a sanctimonious, unpleasant snob who thinks she's better than anyone else. And you know what? If we were meant to see her that way, it would be all right. Unfortunately, we're supposed to feel sorry for her and love her just as she is. She never changes, except for opening up to George when she falls in love with him. She's obviously the moral center of this show, and everyone who loves her is good and everyone who hates her is bad.

So let's sum Sarah up. She has a tragic past, but it doesn't affect her, except when the writers want us to feel sorry for her. She's a convert to Judaism, but she's hardly ever shown practicing her religion, so it's just there for extra sympathy points or to make her look ""exotic"" (gag). She has no physical or mental scars from the war or the concentration camp, but she can speak several languages and beat up a group of men, and she has excellent marksmanship. She's a great nurse. She has a lover, and two other men who love (or at least admire) her. Her lover's mother and sister-in-law hate her for no real reason and want to split her and her lover up. She's the moral center of the story. We're supposed to love all the characters who love her and hate all the characters who hate her. Congratulations, ""A Place to Call Home"": you created a perfect Mary Sue.

Yes, I know, I know. The term ""Mary Sue"" doesn't really apply to original characters, and it carries unfortunate sexist overtones. But in this case, I feel it's accurate. Sarah Adams is a terribly-written character, which is annoying, because she could have been a good character. And the fact that the writers made her a Jew and used the Holocaust as a random tragic background for her, without going into what that would mean for her or even doing the most basic research, is infuriating.

I really can't say much about George, since he has even less of a personality than Sarah. Their love affair is nauseating: they stumble into a cottage, making out and tearing off their clothes like a pair of horny teenagers, while ridiculously-ethereal music plays, and it's all shown to be this beautiful, wondrous love that will last for all time. Of course, with Regina in the picture, I doubt it will last even two seasons, because the characters don't have any common sense or logic, so George will probably fall right into Regina's trap without thinking twice. I'm not willing to wait around and find out, either.

Skip this show and watch ""Downton Abbey"" instead.",1514764800,,9201,4.654556650246305

In subsequent seasons, the villains are impossibly evil and the saints are impossibly good and/or naive.

The acting is phenomenal, and the series is very well written. It addresses a wide range of many social issues that are still relevant today. Shocking secrets, twists and turns and lies to keep you thoroughly involved. Characters to admire and abhor.

Sarah,lead female character is brimming with wisdom. Showing great endurance, determination to keep the faith and poise. The series is a great teacher of history, human pain and modern issues that still remain unresolved in society.

Patriarch George, a good man at heart but narrow-minded. Has difficulty with acceptance, understanding and empathy. Likely attributed to his Matriarch Mother Elizabeth who thrives on running other lives and cannot be described as a lady who wishes everyone well.

6815272,1,B00PKPGLOY,"Starts strong, then devolves into a typical American-style cliffhanger serial with one decent storyline, padded with dreck. Only, they failed to follow the proven American model, in which the story starts strong, goes flabby in the middle, then shapes up well for the cliffhanger season finale, ensuring viewers remain hooked for the next go-round. Here, the season finale is one of the weakest episodes, thankfully, because my interest level in the show dropped below zero. Avoid this time waster.",1501632000,,498,5.3164556962025316

This strategy succeeded beautifully. They did become addicted with the first episode, and we did continue through the next three seasons, 45 episodes in all, with Season Five just around the corner, almost a binge-watch.

Melodrama? An inferior thing? Oh, no, not in the case of ""A Place to Call Home"". Pretty soon I am going to use this same strategy with a good friend of mine, and I'm set to indulge myself for the third time.

There was an opportunity to teach the AU public something about Judaism, but the only thing we learn is that the Nazis done them wrong and that AU anti-Semites think Hitler should have 'finished the job'. There is never any explanation to why upper class Australians hated the Jews and we learn nothing about Jewish religion or culture. For instance; when anyone speaks French, there are subtitles, but when anyone prays in Hebrew, there are no subtitles. Holy days like Sabbath, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah are mentioned, but no explanation to what they signify. There was an attempt to explain Yom Kippur, but it was really insufficient.

It is an Australian family saga in the early 1950s shortly after the end of the war.  A ton of twists and turns. Very engaging. I compared it to Downton Abby when I watched it. My parents just finished it up and loved it. In fairness, it is probably a drama for older people (40-100) since I expect the pacing will be too slow for young people (I am 55). But what a pleasure. The actors are phenomenal. Lots of shocking secrets and lies. The leads are marvelous. 4 whole seasons. I binge watched and could not wait for the next one.

6815313,3,B00PKPGLOY,"The photography is lovely and the acting is good.  The continuity, however, is shamelessly marked by drippy sentimentality and plot manipulation.  While this is not soap opera at its lowest, there is the usual clutter of coincidence, titillation, violence, class and generational conflict, and scandal, all in the context of the conservative 50's in NSW Australia. In particular, the plot is often advanced unconvincingly by a character's brief remarks or by just a look or gesture. For example, Olivia has an epiphany concerning her husband's homosexuality by the way he is looking at, yes, her brother in one of her wedding photographs, who, by the way, was best man. Oh, the humiliation!  Characters are constantly jumping too fast to conclusions and are too easily manipulated by a paucity of information.  The episodes are seeded with so many potentials for conflict etc. that amongst the weeds that spring up there is little room for character development or for details of motivation.  The result is that unrelieved cliche dominates most of the continuity.  Don't get me wrong.  I like soap opera, its romance and titillation which we all love.  But it should also present an intelligent consideration of such items as historical situation, manners, and culture as well as interesting character development.  I refer you obviously to Downton Abbey or to the very excellent series Home Fires, which latter item, I pray, they will renew!",1492905600,8,1442,5.15450643776824

6815318,5,B00PKPGLOY,"Oh my!  What a wonderful series this is.  I'm hooked!  The cinematography, script, acting, I can't believe this hasn't become a huge hit here in the US.  I discovered it by accident on PBS and after watching the first episode I ordered all 4 from Amazon.  I binge-watched Season 3 on a cold, rainy Saturday.  This is a soap opera, pure and simple.  Set in the early 50s in Australia, we are introduced to a very wealthy, upper class family with its usual round of suspects --- the controlling grandmother, her handsome widowed son, his two children: a closet gay son and a daughter who has her eye on the changing times of the future...to name a few.  Enter the nurse, totally unacceptable socially to the grandmother, but clearly becoming her son's love-interest.  Through flashbacks to the war, we learn about the main characters and how their lives were shaped by their war experiences, some truly horrific.  Don't want to throw in any spoilers, so just to say sit back, make the pop corn, snuggle into a comfy chair and let the story, the scenery, and the performances unfold.  I am hard of hearing and happy that the series is closed captioned.  Season 2 has special features at the end - also captioned - so we can meet the actors and enjoy their interpretation of the story lines.  Two husband-and-wife teams are also in the series.

One star for poor representation of reality during the post world wars.

Thanks for trying REALLY very hard to make us believe that people were that good and kind when others stepped out of the ridged and traditional boundaries.

If one is homophobic at all, this is not the entertainment option for you.

Thanks to the writers for being real about abortion.  I think that perhaps that was the most truthful and well written thread.

Regina was the best at being the worst.  Bravo !  Encore !  Imagine I'm throwing roses onto the stage.  :)

Gino, the Italian farmer and Sir Richard were the most authentic to the truth of the times.  Well done.

All the other character threads were spun with liberal cotton candy and equal rights fairy dust....

6815347,4,B00PKPGLOY,"Totally engrossing drama with two brilliantly played and written staring roles for women.  There is balance between the negative energy of the matriarch, Elizabeth and the invading alien Sarah, and the positive relationship unfolding between George, Elizabeth's son, and Sarah.  Because of her power-playing MO, Elizabeth recognizes her match in Sara -- instinctively at first -- and takes an instant dislike to her.  That said, there are a few less compelling relationships -- Anna and her Italian lover, for example.  The idea that a carefully bred beauty of her class and time would be reading 'Lady Chatterley.."" and that her catholic-bred farm boy beau would, after reading a few pages of same, dismiss years of catholic indoctrination, feels contrived.  The chemistry between the two is enough without this motivating prop.  Other oddities that struck an off note: Sara's physical domination of a the local bully felt off.  Women can be successful fighting off men, in certain circumstances. But what works dramatically fails to resonate humanly. No matter how violent their backstory, women don't borrow trouble by taking on men in open combat [unless armed], to the extent of pursuing them into their man-caves to humiliate them further.  Doesn't scan.  Yet, on the whole, this story, playing out in a grand family homestead set in magnificent Australian countryside, is a visual and emotional treat. The main characters are well written, believable, complex, and nicely played.  It makes for great adult entertainment, assuming one has the hours to spend watching it.",1483315200,7,1576,5.293172690763052

6815355,5,B00PKPGLOY,"Admittedly, this isn't the kind of show that I like. With that said, my wife thinks it's wonderful, and it fills the void she had when Downton Abbey came to an end. As a matter of fact, in her opinion, it's as good as that show.

According to her, this series is more like a soap opera than anything else. With that said, it's a great soap opera and the issues that are addressed in the series are relevant and powerful.

This is a period drama, taking place in Australia during the early to mid 1950's. It addresses a wide range of issues, ranging from lingering post-war anti-semitism, to many of the same social issues that are relevant today.

The acting is first rate, and the series is well written. My wife has thoroughly enjoyed watching every available episode of this show, and is always waiting in anticipation for the availability of the next season. She finds herself heavily immersed into the characters, and thinks that the moral and social issues that this show evolves around, are handled in an exceptionally stimulating way.",1481328000,5,1042,4.683060109289618

The story centers around a nurse, who has converted to Judaism, and whose path intersects with a wealthy Australian family on their way back from Britain to their home.  The nurse saves the life of one of the characters, and it is this act which serves to be the springboard for the plot, which I shall not reveal.

The acting is generally excellent, but the outstanding feature is the photography by John Stokes, ACS- truly painterly images, gathered with the crown jewel of digital cinema cameras, according to Mr. Stoke's website- the Sony X65.",1476748800,,652,4.734513274336283

The script was true to the era, with the exception of a few grammatical glitches, first person pronouns used according to contemporary disdain for case which would have marked anyone as an illiterate boor in the early 50s. The second season began to devolve. It drew on a few day-time serial techniques to further the plot. By the third season, we have a contemporary soap opera, the cultural attitudes of today superimposed on the dress and setting and laws of the early 50s.

As much as I loved the first season, I cannot praise the second nor the third. What a pity. It started out brilliantly and succumbed to the zeitgeist.",1476144000,,752,4.696969696969697

6815392,5,B00PKPGLOY,"In a nutshell, it is a 1950s Australian ""Dallas,"" but with much higher quality acting and storylines than your average prime time soap opera. It follows the introduction of a nurse with a past, Sarah Adams, into the lives one of Australia's richest families, the Blighs. The series blends the best of a soap opera - with all the addictive twists, cliffhangers and scandals - with some really serious drama and social issues, such as how gays and Jews were treated in 1950s Australia. IMPORTANT NOTE: The first season was great but it was my least favorite in the series. It was poorly paced and started to be repetitive about 2/3 of the way through the season. However, after I took a short break, I came back, finished season 1 --  and seasons 2 and 3 were perfectly paced and very gripping. I would really give the series 4.75 stars for the lull in the first season and the completely unnecessary spoiler at the beginning of the second season. However, I can assure you that this is a series you won't regret watching! Sidenote: I am a person who loves genteel dramas like Jane Austen adaptions to harsher series like Game of Thrones and Spartacus Blood and Sand. and everything in between.

There is also plenty of fornication and adultery to go around.  I am so ashamed I watched it.  I feel like I just fell out of the stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down.

I did enjoy the setting of the movie (Australia just after WWII) and the background music, the clothes, cars, etc.  That was the enticing hook for me.  The actors are also good at their ""craft"" thereby enticing you to keep watching.

In season three there is nudity, oral sex is introduced, more and more homosexuality, abortion, and it just goes from bad to worse.  Need I say more?

I do not blame the actors.
The poor dears; it isn't  fault their that they have to work with an idiotic script and plot.
There is never a  moment's relief from the torment these accursed people are experiencing in their pathetic lives.
This family goes from one god awful, self inflicted, traumatic experience after  another.
The only family member who seems to have any awareness of what's going on is the evil matriarch who is behind it all----the rest of the family just wander in and out of scenes wondering what the hell has hit them.

I did love Marta Dusseldorp (Sarah), Noni Hazlehurst (Elizabeth) and absolutely LOVE TO HATE Jenni Baird (Regina), who is the most perfect villaness.  Jenni Baird, immaculately executed character, Regina, is the stand out of this cast, for me.

There's lots of twists and turns that keep you interested episode to episode, but the writing is intelligent, and the characters are well developed and endearing (with one or two villainous exceptions.)

6815452,5,B00PKPGLOY,"Australia and much of the world experienced considerable change during the 1950s and particularly with greater integration of social classes. This wonderful drama series captures semi-rural Australia somewhat socially divided by tradition and more modern values of wider personal choice. Well travelled nurse Sarah Adams and the aristocratic Bligh family sit at the centre of the narrative and their lives come together, but the past has a profound impact on all concerned. Learning more about the essence of all these people makes every episode an opportunity for discovery, and their journeys contain colourful and difficult moments. How it all works out for each person becomes addictive viewing, and just when things seem to have settled a new obstacle presents itself.

Some of the story lines often border on the ridiculous, but the acting is so good and it's so wonderfully produced that I made it almost through the whole first season before I realized I was watching a modern day Dallas or Dynasty.

Well written and acted with sufficiently integrated plot lines and few glaring errors in the story-telling, for my time and money, this family drama series belongs in the same league with Downton Abbey. Every character who has a story more than holds up his or her own. Not all heroes are always heroic nor are the villains always villainous. You won't be disappointed.",1451520000,,478,4.841463414634147

I do like Downton Abby but the characters in this show are far more complex and fascinating than Downton's characters.  Each of the characters has baggage from their past with which they have to deal, as well as drama unfolding in the present day.  I watched the first two seasons in less than a week and am so excited that a third season was created.

This is 1953.  Hey, whoever writes this trash, at least get a feel for the times before you make stuff up.  Plus the mandatory homosexual drama running through it . . .  You would think homosexuals are 98% of the population, all the attention they get.  (I think my gay fatigue has topped-out.)  And all the conversations are stilted and unlike any conversations I've ever had, with all these Australians  talking about every single little issue and trying to get at each others true feelings and work things out.

6815511,5,B00PKPGLOY,"A PLACE TO CALL HOME is a masterpiece of soap opera indulgence.  Clearly inspired by the lush, over-blown, emotion-heavy melodramas of Hollywood director Douglas Sirk in the 1950s, A PLACE TO CALL HOME delivers the goods.

A compelling lead character played by Marta Dusseldorp is the backbone of the series.  Her haunted, determined Sarah Adams returns to Australia after the upheaval of World War II and its aftermath.  Desperate to find a place to call home, Sarah is nobody's fool and faces challenge after challenge with dignity and strength.  Her involvement with the Bligh family begins in her capacity as a nurse on board a ship returning to Australia.  From there the story strands weave and grow, all to the fulfillment of a soap opera afficianado's best dreams.

To even try to encapsulate the various plot lines would be a disservice.  Enjoy, luxuriate and soak in the suds.

Do be warned there is an awful lot of sex going on (did they have sex in the '50s?)  While not overly graphic, there's a lot of huffing and puffing, in case that is a concern.

Otherwise, get out the hankies and popcorn.",1443139200,,1108,4.7486910994764395

6815596,5,B00PKPGLOY,"I was expecting something along the lines of a Hallmark feel-good movie. Boy, was I wrong! This could have been one of those cliff-hanger movie serials back in the day--every episode stops just where you need to know the next thing. I don't think I've ever seen so many secrets, lies, and villainy packed into a series. Each episode positively brims with these things. Noni Hazelhurst--looking exactly the way a sweet, kind, loving grandmother should look, steals the show as one of the most diabolical characters seen on TV in a long time. Marta Dusseldorp is excellent, too, as the war-scarred heroine w/ all the horrible secrets. The first few episodes start off quietly--well, except for that attempted suicide to cover a scandalous secret and the hint that Sarah is not what--or even who--she seems. Still, the quieter first episodes will hardly prepare you for the betrayals, plotting, scheming and downright evil yet to come. We intended to watch this patiently episode by episode on PBS, but when it popped up on Acorn we succumbed to temptation and raced head. Starting Season 2 now--and it only gets better.",1435968000,,1117,4.946808510638298

6815600,5,B00PKPGLOY,"A wonderful series--believable characters whose singular and often unexpected stories make a robust narrative arc for the series as a whole. As a gay man, I was particularly touched by closeted son Richard's story, and the tragic ways in which his family and psychiatrists misunderstood his ""perversion,"" as it is called throughout without question (since that is how gayness was understood in the early 1950s when the series takes place). Superb actors and acting. One really feels for the characters--even the family matriarch (beautifully acted) who one admires and despises at the same time. A huge watching pleasure: once one starts, it's hard to stop. So glad to hear the series will continue, and there will be at least four seasons' worth.",1435536000,2,747,5.131147540983607

6815613,5,B00PKPGLOY,"A PLACE TO CALL HOME, a hit Australian television series, is a period drama thats worth  binge-watching, which shows us the ties that hold families together and the things that can tear them apart.  It introduces surrounded-by-mystery, indomitable nurse Sarah Adams (played by that blond beauty of JACK IRISH, Marta Dusseldorp). Sarah, who has endured a harsh World War II in France, after twenty years in Europe, has, because her mother is ill, returned to her native Australia.  She becomes involved with the influential and rich Bligh family, specifically the son and heir,  George Bligh (Brett Climo). Sarah and George must contend with the schemes of his mother Elizabeth (Noni Hazlehurst) to part them.  As George's daughter, Anna (Abby Earl) is determined to marry the unsuitable Gino (Aldo Mignone), while son James (David Berry) and his newly-wed newly-pregnant English wife, Olivia (Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood), find their marriage troubled. The lush production uses its setting in post-World War II, 1950 Inverness, Australia, to  tackle eternal issues of anti-Semitism, social class and sexuality with insight.  I received this as a review copy. The set consists of  13 episodes, has subtitles, thank goodness, as not everyone can follow the Australian accent.  And beware: it does contain scenes of violence and sexuality.

The scenery is gorgeous in this high-quality production that was described as a cross between DYNASTY and DOWNTON ABBEY with a twist of MAD MEN by Parade magazine.  Mind you, it  is a sexy femme-oriented soap opera, without a doubt, taking place in the womans world of houses, families, children.  Acting is uniformly top rank: Dusseldorp carries the enterprise with elan.  Supporting actors include, as locals, Craig Hall as Dr. Jack Duncan, Deborah Kennedy as Doris Collins, Frankie J. Holden as Roy Briggs.  Also Sara Wiseman as Carolyn Bligh, aunt to the Bligh children and Jenni Baird, as Regina Standish, the childrens other aunt, sister to their late mother.  The two aunts have been rather peculiarly cast, as the two actors strongly resemble each other: tall dark-haired buxom women with strong, handsome facial features: it might take viewers new to the series a while to sort them.  But you can always recognize Auntie Regina by her blue eyeshadow.
The episodes:
1. The Prodigal Daughter.  After 2o years in Europe, nurse Sarah Adams returns to Australia to see her grieving mother.  Her hopes for reconciliation unmet, Sarah contacts George Bligh, whose mother she had nursed on the transoceanic trip back, for employment.  His mother, however, has other ideas.
2. The Welcome Mat.  Sarah leaves the guest cottage at Ash Park, the Bligh country seat, to take up new lodgings at Doris Collins boarding house.  But  nosy landlady Doris may make her regret the decision. A riding accident devastates Anna and brings back painful memories for Sarah. Elizabeth is caused to wonder anew about Sarah, who can ride like a stockman, pick up a rifle and euthanize a fatally injured horse in five minutes flat.  Olivia gets welcome news.
3. Truth Will Out. Sarah arrives at the hospital for her first day on the job only to face questions from Dr. Jack Duncan about her real name. Deeply offended by the invasion of her privacy, she resolves to leave Inverness.
4. The Mona Lisa Smile.  Jack gets quite a shock while accompanying Sarah on her daily rounds.  Olivias curiosity about her new husbands former lover grows; Sarah begins to open up about her past after spending time with the local Jewish family.
5. Day of Atonement.  With Yom Kippur approaching, Sarah tries to make amends with people.  Her spiritual cleansing, however, resurrects difficult emotions about her husbands death.
6. Thats Amore.  Anna, who has been at pains to illustrate she had no interest in her suitable suitor, Andrew Swanson, is determined to marry Gino, whom she has loved since childhood. James and Olivias marriage reaches a breaking point. Sarah gets herself into the middle of a dangerous domestic dispute involving one of her patients.
7. Boom. Sarah learns that her mother is dying and rushes to Sydney to be at her bedside.  George and Anna also head to the city to visit his sister, Carolyn, from whom Anna secretly wants help obtaining birth control. Back at Ash Park, Mrs. Bligh takes James and Olivia into her confidence.
8. Worlds Apart. Mrs. Bligh's heart attack upends the household-but also gives everyone some unaccustomed freedom while she's recovering in  hospital. Anna and Gino's plans to tell their families about their engagement hit a roadblock; George and Sarah, who is now boarding at Roy Briggs house, start to move forward with their relationship.
9. Cane Toad.  Mrs. Bligh calls Georges sister in law, Regina Standish to Ash Park to help her prevent George and Sarahs budding romance. James and Olivia come to terms with their respective foes.
10. Lest We Forget.  George organizes a reception for visiting Japanese business men which awakens Jacks anger and PTSD over atrocities committed on him during the war by his Japanese jailers. Anna anxiously awaits her pregnancy test results.  Sarah deals with Reginas hostility.
11. True to Your Heart.  Mrs. Bligh returns home to Ash Park, but everyone is not happy about it.  Olivia desperately wants to get away, pleads with James for a change of scenery.  Regina connives to extend her visit George receives an ultimatum; Anna faces a major decision.
12. New Beginning.  Georges proposal may have serious consequences for his future.  Anna prepares to face her own consequences, based on her decision, but fate intervenes.  James and Olivia head to Sydney; Sarah comes to dinner at Ash Park.
13. Secret Love. James seeks treatment for his problems, but a confrontation with his father sends him over the edge.  Anna and Gino tell their families about their engagement; Sarah suggests a novel way for them to test their love; Elizabeth Bligh suggests the same method to Sarah and George. Regina goes to Europe to investigate Sarahs past.

This show is involving and increasingly powerful as it reaches its conclusion with its heady mix of elegant houses, beautiful clothes and cars, family secrets, passion, romance and intrigue it should appeal to viewers  suffering Downton Abbey withdrawal.  I sure found it addictive.",1434672000,,6317,5.09126213592233

6815619,2,B00PKPGLOY,"Contrary to all of the glowing reviews, I am not that enthralled with A Place to call home .  To me, Series One in 13 episodes, about an hour in length each, was just,  at best, a soap opera set in Australia in the early 1950s.  I did not find the story line or any character, as portrayed, to be in anyway enduring or believable.

As in most soaps that I have seen, A Place to call home is filled with many stereotypical and unbelievable characters that, to me, are acted very poorly.  Following are my examples of characters that I found to be just too stereotypical and unbelievable:

 First of all, there is the rather full-bosomed, ageing and bitchy grandmother/matriarch that will destroy, by any means possible, those that dare to disagree with her or anyone that threatens her familys good name.  Of course, she controls and has all the money. There is a lot of ""scene chewing"" and over acting by the actress in this role.

Secondly, there is the very good, weak and self righteous son that falls in love with the wrong kind of woman (In this case, a very strong woman with a mysterious past.  She happens to be Jewish by conversion with a very modern hairdo)

Thirdly, there is the beloved sex-starved granddaughter that falls in love with the very sexy field hand that is Italian (in this country the character would be Mexicanin fact, in this program one cant tell the difference between the two cultures because of the heavy Italian accents used by the actors that sound a lot like an Hispanic accent to my ears).  I do feel that the actress in this role is far too mature looking to be believable as a young woman.

Finally, the last example of, to me, stereotypical characters is the character that irritated me the most.  That character is the very weak gay grandson.  In order to change he voluntarily endures shock treatments and attempts suicide.  Anything to avoid being that wayhe is, after all married and with his rather bitchy wife expecting a baby.  However, hes got the hots for the hunky, willing and gorgeous ranch hand.  What to do besides fall into the waiting and well built muscular arms of the ranch hand or be cured.  After all , this is the 1950s and that kind of behavior will not be tolerated.  (By the way, I grew up  in  the 1950s). The actor in his portrayal of this character tends to whine a lot.

6815638,5,B00PKPGLOY,"AN UPPER CRUST FAMILY MELODRAMA WHERE THE GHOSTS OF WWII STILL HAUNT --- SOAPY AT TIMES BUT THE CHARACTERS HAVE REAL SUBSTANCE

***NEWS ON SEASONS 3 & 4 BELOW***

For those who love period drama, this is a little more on the side of period melodrama but the characters are well created and acted so they are substantial. I admit I was a little skeptical at first. For those who hate family melodrama, it still may not suit your tastes. However, most of the characters are reasonably good people who are trying to do the right thing in their own mind. They are not caricatures fighting over the family fortune as you might expect in a show involving an upper crust family. Their challenges are that of the older Victorian values vs. the evolving youth. It's nice to see an Australian entry into this genre that gives a slightly different take than American and British audiences might be used to. From the Victorian manor house, the 40's and 50's music, the classic cars, the elegance of society, or contrast of pastoral Australian ranch land. The uniqueness of this show is somewhat symbolized by the elegant Jaguar Mark V chauffeured car in contrast to the country roads of their estate.

THE STORY (No spoilers): 1953, less than ten years after WWII, Sarah Adams is traveling home from Europe to Australia after 20 years away from home. She has been called home to see her ailing mother after a long estrangement from the family as a result her conversion to Judaism. Working her passage as ship's nurse, she meets the wealthy Bligh family while treating the difficult family matriarch Elizabeth Bligh. Sarah also develops a connection to widower George Bligh (Elizabeth's son and head of the family). Just before arriving in Australia, an incident involving one of the younger Bligh family brings Sarah in on part of a family secret.  This causes more conflict between Sarah and the cantankerous matriarch Elizabeth. Sarah also is more than a little mysterious as she keeps secret her activity and whereabouts during WWII. Fate will bring Sarah and the Bligh family together again as Sarah finds herself in difficulty. However, Elizabeth is threatened by both the family secret Sarah is privy to, and the affection George Bligh clearly holds for Sarah. Elizabeth proceeds to dig into Sarah's past in an effort to exhume war scars that will prevent any relationship between the head of this wealthy family (with ties to both government and aristocracy) and someone she considers wholly unsuitable to their religion and social class. Sarah obtains a job working as a nurse locally and manages to endear herself to both local residents and George's two grown children Anna and James. This is a family drama so of course siblings Anna and James each have secrets or struggles of their own. The privileged and modern, but very well adjusted, Anna is in love with Gino. He is the son of a local Italian farmer who's wife also serves in the Bligh household. Anna's relationship is used to contrast her father's since she also is seeing someone not from her social class or religion. All the family love each other, but the secrets and struggles they harbor are a regular procession of revelations as time passes. The only seeming true evil is the arrival of Regina Standish who is the sister of George's deceased wife, killed by a Japanese bomb during the war. Regina is a beautiful and calculated diplomat's wife who just lost her husband and has always had designs on George since she lost out to her sister when she was young. As Australia lurches out of its colonial and war scarred past, the residents of fictional Inverness, New South Wales, struggle to overcome their losses and demons from the war as well. The upheaval will have Sarah moving from place to place as she tires to find herself again, and...  ""A Place to Call Home"".

THERE IS A SEASON 3... AND 4! This show was originally cancelled after season two.  However, it was since renewed for seasons 3 and 4. Season 3 is already up for pre-order and available on Amazon streaming service. The first two seasons of this series in the US are on DVD, but there are UK Blu Rays marked for regions A,B and C.  I see only DVD so far on season 3 time of writing this.

OTHER THOUGHTS: As I said, I was a little skeptical at first and I am not always into family melodramas. The issues here are more socially driven and are problems many families could encounter. The family is upper class, but more relatable than you might think. After I got past the first episode and my skepticism, I ended up blowing through two seasons in a single weekend! I loved the characters I was supposed to love and the acting is top notch. Australian dramas have only trickled into the US market until lately and if you haven't discovered them yet, this really isn't a bad place to start.",1432857600,68,4823,4.691489361702128

6815664,1,B00PKPGLOY,"This review is going to contain spoilers, so don't read further if you don't want to know details.

The purpose of this review is to let others know not to waste their money on this tripe. I feel duped by the positive reviews, and would never have spent a penny on this garbage had I known the content.

The basis of this series is a Gentile woman who supposedly converted to Judaism, even though she has no clue what Judaism 101 looks like. She doesn't keep kosher, doesn't live by holy Jewish law, in fact does several things that are extremely contrary to Jewish law (gossips, betrays patient/nurse confidentiality, has no clue what a mikveh is, etc.), but for some reason, we're expected to believe she's Jewish. The two most offensive aspects of this was her public nudity for the mikveh, and her ""observance"" of Yom Kippur. The writers obviously had no idea what a mikveh is, nor how it's carried out, and they further had no clue what Yom Kippur is.

The actress who plays the Jewess is painfully bland, perpetually simultaneously angry and smug, and boring to watch.

The plot is unbelievable. She's a nurse and a vet (who kills a horse with a broken leg, no less), and somehow manages to (badly) Krav Maga her way through an attack on a farmhand. They set her up as some sort of saviour, through highly improbable scenarios.  Don't get me started on the medical misinformation, particularly in the birth scene.

We couldn't even complete watching 2 discs before we decided to send this garbage back.

If you are interested in seeing an Australian poor man's version of a smarmy soap, this is for you. If you have better taste and interests, pass on this. No wonder Channel Seven dropped this garbage. Not recommended.",1429488000,25,1726,4.657894736842105

""as it happens.""  It is the story of nurse Sarah Adams who is returning to her homeland of Australia after a 20 year absence.  On her homeward voyage she meets the wealthy Bligh family as she is called upon to help them in her capacity as ship's nurse.  The matriarch of the family is less than pleased when her widower son and his adult children befriend Sarah, but she is certain that the end of the voyage will mark the end of the acquaintance.  Their paths cross again, and the connection becomes a war of wits and wills.  Sarah Adams is mysterious, but honest, devoted to her profession, and a loving, caring person.  She is also tough, smart, honorable and valiant.  Sarah Adams is a heroine, she is good, or tries to do good things, and brings out the best in other people.....with the exception of Mrs. Bligh.  This is a very grown up drama, with both bad and good elements portrayed realistically.  I cannot help but think of a dear friend who passed away from an illness much too soon in life and how much she would have loved this series.  We used to talk about the type of stories we enjoyed seeing, ones that were not over the top outlandish, but that had grace and humility, triumph and atonement for the characters.  Just in one season the characters grow and change, and like life there is much to suffer, as there is much to enjoy.  My friend and I would have been talking endlessly about this story, so I'm telling you about it in honor and memory of her.",1424995200,,1742,4.352941176470588
6815688,5,B00PKPGLOY,"Again Australia proves it can compete on international TV with this historical drama series. Sarah returns to her birth home after a 20-year estrangement with her mom. Discovering the reason is a part of the drama. Working as a ship nurse, she meets the rich Bligh family. Bligh's live in a large farm estate with Elizabeth (matriarch), her son George, his kids Anna and James (who's married to Olivia `Livvy'). Also among the every episode characters are Dr Jack, and laborer Gino who has feelings for Anna. Through these and other characters, evolving plots deal with period issues of family, religion (Catholic and Jewish), post-war feelings against Japan and Germany, homosexuality and its 1950s treatments, class differences, marital violence, abortion, contraceptives, gossip, promiscuity, alcoholism, class differences, and more. All this while enjoying the fantastic cinematography of Aussie country estate life and compelling screenwriting. Not to mention all the 1950's music.
So good it is almost impossible to not watch episodes back-to-back.

There was a second season, so more to come. And there is talk of going into season 3. I hope so. This is as good as any drama series on TV in this decade.

6815689,5,B00PKPGLOY,"Superb show.  It's been streaming for some time on Acorn. TV. My review from Amazon. UK follows:  It will be curious to see how long it takes for the PBS System in the United States to wake up and put on this very interesting production. My guess is they will miss it entirely and it will end up going to Netflix or Amazon prime. We loved the first series, which we watched on a multi-region DVD player in the United States and then also bought the second series from Amazon. UK. You can imagine my amusement when I learned that the second series was being shipped by air from Australia. Yes, someone has commented it is a high-level soap opera that is such a much higher order and the programs we have that I really beg people to watch it. Also I have heard that there is a third series to be produced by another Australian television organization and possibly even a fourth so cheers for that.",1422144000,,895,4.3532934131736525

6815692,5,B00PKPGLOY,"5 stars,  If I could provide 10 stars, I would.  BUT a note--half questions and half warning.  This comes up from an amazon search for season 2, and allows pre-order. Carefuly look at the cover--this is season 1 on DVD.  I streamed season 1, as many others have done.  I don't think it's season 2.  Correct me where wrong.  I'd love it and wold buy season 2 in a heart beat.  Be careful that you are ordering what you think you are ordering

I would love info on season 2 if anyone knows when it will be available.

Thanks",1420156800,2,522,4.181818181818182

It is well worth the time.",1531094400,,295,3.8524590163934427
