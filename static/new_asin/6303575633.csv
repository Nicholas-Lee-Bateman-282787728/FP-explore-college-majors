699343,1,6303575633,"Not really sure if this is a good workout or not.  Be carefull when buying this DVD.  I bought this DVD twice from Amazon and both times instead of sending me Sculpt & Tone, which I ordered and in which my invoice specifically stated, they sent me Step & Tone.  I have now placed my order for Sculpt & Tone from Gilad's official website.  I paid a little bit more, but I am sure they will get the order right.  I usually have good service with Amazon but with buying this DVD the service has been poor.  I am still hopeful though that this will be a great workout.  I know the other DVD's I have of his, Step Aerobics, The New Best of Bodies In Motion, and Step & Tone are all awesome!  D",1121385600,16,688,4.044444444444444

  After two weeks of doing one segment a day, four days a week I could tell a difference in my tone, strength, and endurance. Plus, I just felt better.

  Some may do the whole work out, but I have found that I don't have time to spend a whole hour so I use heavier weights and do one segment each day. The results have been great. It's too bad this can't be found in a dvd format.",1090800000,3,624,3.874015748031496

He's got great presentation, and endless enthusiasm.  He always helps you concentrate on form, but have fun.  Not a beginner's workout, but certainly an awesome way to spend 67 minutes.

699346,5,6303575633,i started working with gilad when i first viewed him on cable televison. since working with gilad i have been very happy with my results which can be noticed within a 30 day straight workout of about 3 days per week. i  started with the fat burning workout which only lasted about 3 months  and  managed to lose about 8lbs of fat.  i then switched to the toning and abs  workout which results came within a months time. i have yet to see anyone  who can compare with the health and mind management that gilad can provide  to my self worth. i would recomend these videos to anyone  and hope to see  these videos on the market for a very long time.  thank you gilad!,945907200,9,664,4.24

699857,4,6303575633,"While I haven't owned many workouts from Gilad, I have been familiar with him for some time.  However, I didn't even know this workout even existed until recently.  After viewing a clip from his website for it, I decided to order it.

I really like this workout, it is all sculpting like the title says but it's broken up into circuits.  Each circuit begins with leg work but it moves from one exercise to the next continuously.  First lunges, then squats, then calf raises.  The lunges are front lunges, sometimes performed in a three count variation.  Other leg work seen are plie squats in first and second position, I choose to do them all in wide stance, just my preference.  I also do reverse lunges instead of forward ones.  There is other standing leg work you will see, leg raises to the front, side and back all using one dumbell for resistance.  It might sound like a lot of leg work but the sets are fairly short, 8 lunges and 8 squats each, the calf raises are a little longer but they may be easier to perform for some, at least they are for me.

Following the leg work in each circuit, you will focus on an upper body muscle group.  The first circuit is biceps, you do traditional curls, then halfways up, halfways down before finishing with traditional curls again.  Then you will do a set of concentration curls for each side.  The second circuit is triceps, double arm kickbacks, then straight arm lifts (I am not sure what they are called, french presses, and one arm kickbacks.  The third circuit is back, double arm rows in a standing position, rear deltoid raises, shoulder rolls (for a little rest), and one arm rows are among the rest of the exercises.

Chest is next, you work it standing with one arm crossing over, then the other arm, then both arms.  Then you move to the floor for pushups, each with a different hands position.  I modify a little here because I dislike pushups, I do the first set, then I do one set each of chest flies and chest presses in place of the other two sets of pushups.  If I ever get stronger in the pushup area, I might try the other hand positions.

The shoulders are worked last, and with a variety of exercises.  Starting with side deltoid raises, then a version of frontal raises although they raise the weights higher than I have seen in other videos.  I just do normal front raises in place of these.  Then you will see upright rows, more front raises but lower this time, first one arm at a time then both arms.  Shoulder shrugs and rotator cuff work follow, before finishing out with overhead presses, first in traditional position with arms at 90 degrees, then adding a twist which I have heard referred to as ""Arnold Presses"".

There is one last circuit for legs, lunges, squats, calf raises, plie squats and more standing leg raises in all three positions (front, side and rear).

Following this is a short ab segment, which I liked.  They use a dumbell between the knees, I personally skipped this but may add in the future.  Gilad states that by using the dumbell, it aids in keeping your back pressed to the floor.  It appears the cast uses a light dumbell for this segment, I personally think 3-5 pounds max would be sufficient.  You will see traditional curls, then adding a couple different variations.  A combination upper and lower exercise, and some oblique work.  After that Gilad stretches you out.

Gilad is a good instructor, I like his demeanor.  Some might think he is too drill sargeanty or barky but I don't find him so.  He is to the point but pleasant and encouraging as well.  He uses amazing scenery for most if not all his workouts.  This is set on a Hawaiian beach, there are people in the background but I didn't find it too much of a distraction.

About the only negative I can find is that this workout is a little long, about an hour.  It goes by pretty quickly so it's not bad but I typically am moving away from longer workouts these days.  But I like this enough that I see myself doing it regularly anyway.

I would recommend this for intermediates, and beginners too using light weights.  Advanced people can use heavier weights and still be challenged.  I found that had to use lighter weights for most of the upper body work.  It moves from one exercise to the next fairly quickly.  I found I had to pause pretty often to grab different weights.  For the lower body work I used a set of 10 pounders, for the standing leg raises I used a 5 pounder. For the upper body work, I used mainly 5 and 8 pounders, with one 15 pounder for the one arm rows.

Overall, I am glad that I found this DVD.  It's a little lengthy but moves quickly and doesn't have much of a dread factor.  You work your muscles well and thoroughly.  4 and a half stars overall.",1320537600,25,4748,4.438657407407407
699858,5,6303575633,"This was a Gilad product that I wasn't previously aware of.  I love it.  I love the setting, and love the fact that it isn't way advanced, but also isn't very easy, either, though there is modifier in it who is pregnant.  Good, basic weight workout.  It calls for two sets of dumbbells.  I would use as many as four.  It can be modified up or down by weight selection, and sometimes by letting them complete the long sets while you rest.  It goes from one exercise to the next, so it may pay to go slightly lighter than you normally would on a heavy weights day.

As always, it's Gilad, so I pretty much knew what to expect.  Long sets, basic moves that turn suprisingly difficult (for me, anyway).  Not for those looking for fancy moves, trendy clothing (the outfits may have been trendy in the early 90's)or who think nothing made is advanced enough for them.  But for something that gets the job done and gives you something nice to look at it's great.",1300060800,6,955,4.369318181818182
699859,5,6303575633,"I just got this dvd in the mail today, but I have been working out with dvd's 5 days per week since 08/2009.  I must say this dvd is great, the toning moves are effective and I haven't seen most of them on the 20 + dvds I have in my library.

He doesn't do any one exercise too long to discourage you, but be assured that the muscle will be worked because he comes back to the same move later on in the workout.

Hopefully I will see results soon.
