3619750,5,B001GTS9H0,Of course I love the School House Rock DVD's because I grew up with these on Saturday mornings. I'm a firm believer on learning through song.,1249516800,4,141,4.461538461538462
3619751,4,B001GTS9H0,"This DVD has some great songs that even my 3 yr old is starting to memorize so I definitely think it will help my kids learn their multiplication tables.  The only thing that drives me crazy about this DVD is the menu selection.  I usually play it in the van and the short songs are great for quick trips.  However you have to manually select the ""Play All"" feature so that it will go once over all the songs.  It is quite a few clicks to get to that option too so it makes it hard when you can't see the screen to know if you're on ""Play All"".  Otherwise you select one song at a time and since they are pretty short you have to do that often.  All in all a great dvd but very poor menu selection.",1243728000,56,698,3.95
3619752,5,B001GTS9H0,"I watched Schoolhouse Rock when I was a kid.  My siblings and I were riveted on Saturday mornings.  Those videos helped me tremendously.  Now, I'm a teacher with struggling kids and English Learners. Whenever we have extra time, they want to watch these videos. Kids from other classrooms want to come and watch.  My 13-year-old is hypnotized every bit as much as my 3rd graders.  How great is that?",1240790400,41,399,4.72463768115942

And with all of the New Math ""tricks"" that are being taught before the kids have the fundamentals down, the entire process got her unbelievably confused and down on herself.  This video has been great at getting a lot of that ""knowing"" into her head without depressing her.  We alternate on school days -- one day she does Reflex Math on the computer, and the next she watches ""Schoolhouse Rock"".  It took about a month before the numbers started just coming to her, but now she has almost all of it down.  As I work with her on her math pages, I can hear her sing the relevant pice of the song to get the answer to the problem at hand.

Perhaps this happened through the process of recording from old media technology onto a dvd and it lost some of its clarity.  I'm not sure.  My 8 year old son, who I bought it for, watched the zeros but refused to watch any more of it.  :(",1300579200,7,362,4.279411764705882

8307042,1,B001GTS9H0,"There are 12 songs on this DVD, each is supposed to be a little tune for the numbers 0 through 12.  We only watched the first song, 'My Hero Zero'.  It was an odd little song that wasn't even cute that showed kids how to add 0 to the end of a number - which would be a multiple of 10.  For example, it showed a $4, then $40, then $400, then $4,000, without even discussing that they were multiplying the numbers by 10.  I would have expected a multiplication DVD to show that multiplying something by zero is ZERO, not adding it to the end of each number.  I don't think there was any educational value to this DVD.",1512259200,,615,4.091666666666667

8307044,1,B001GTS9H0,Got this based off the great video review. Wish I had gone moth my instincts not to. The songs are really too long winded. Nothing is to the point and some are even confusing. Their much too long for my kids to memorize. My almost 9 year old was not interested in this & thought it was boring. Got to admit a lot of the songs have a boring tune to them.
