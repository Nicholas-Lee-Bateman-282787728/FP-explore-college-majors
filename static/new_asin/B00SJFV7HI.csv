8698544,5,B00SJFV7HI,"This is the best 4 pack I've ever gotten.  Usually, when you buy these packs, you get 2 discs with 4 movies crammed on them and there are no subtitles or any special features.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive 4 individual discs inside the pack.  You wouldn't suspect this by looking at the case, because it's very narrow.  The discs are stacked one on top of the other.
So far, I have watched, ""Crazy Stupid Love,"" ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" and ""Life As We Know It."" They all had both subtitles and deleted scenes.  This is an excellent value.

Short synopsis on each film:
""Crazy Stupid Love"":  When a long married couple gets a divorce, the husband is befriended by a womanizing, young guy.  This old guy makeover is one of the many hilarious sub-plots in the movie.  Very funny movie with a surprise ending.

""He's Just Not That Into You"": A movie that explores a whole slew of relationships with a lot of comedy.  ""Interviews"" within the movie give it a ""When Harry Met Sally"" feel.  Interesting to see how the various characters are connected and how their stories are resolved.

""Life As We Know It"": Two opposites are forced to raise a child together when their friends tragically die.  Though there are funny moments, this movie has a slightly more serious feel.

""The Notebook"": Two romantic stories that intertwine.  A woman must choose between two relationships - one passionate and reckless, the other, steady and accepted by her parents.",1514764800,3,1461,4.692913385826771
