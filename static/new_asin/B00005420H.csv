1392591,5,B00005420H,"This movie has to rate as the greatest tear jerker of all time. Sad thing is that is was a true story. Its rare to see a movie where everyone is a victim. Not only do you have a mother who has cancer and is dying but you have to watch her one by one give up her kids before she dies due to the fact that her husband is physically unable to care for them. You admire the tough decision Mrs Fray had to make in the best interest of her kids but it does not ease the pain her husband, and kids had to endure as well.",1237766400,8,513,3.7155963302752295
1392592,5,B00005420H,"This was an excellent video.  Based upon a true story, the movie was very well acted.  It was both tragic and touching, and I would recommend it highly.  When substitute teaching, I showed it to a high school child development class, and they found it worthwhile and interesting.",1228003200,5,279,4.770833333333333

However!  the oldest daughter would go on to become an art teacher in a small town in Iowa.  I was one of her pupils.
I have fond memories of Joanne Samsel as my teacher.
I have no idea where she is now, but, I hope life has been good to her.",1199923200,8,317,3.9375
1392594,5,B00005420H,"This is a great movie, in which I can't wait for it to come out in DVD, if it ever will. Ann-Margret plays a poverty stricken mother dying of breast cancer soon after her tenth baby is born. Knowing her husband is an irresponsible drunk that seldom holds down a job, she tries to find homes for her 10 children before she gets too sick. She has each child have trial sleep-overs at the houses she chooses for her kids, and if the kids come home and complain about the home, she places them in another home. She also has one son that has seizures all the time, and is concerned for him if he's given to the wrong uncaring family. This movie is wonderful, and is a true story. How hard it must of been to worry about your kid's lives while you're dying and need rest. A very good movie that brought even my dad to tears as he said that this woman was so loving to not only her children, but her husband. She still took care of her husband knowing he inflicted this on himself (being drunk all the time). Not only did she place the children in wonderful homes, she did this before she died so she knew they would be taken care of. She also visited them right before she died to make sure they were all right and happy. On the original viewing of this movie played on TV, the actual kids gathered together as adults and watched this movie together. Some hadn't seen each other in years. What a tribute to their mother! A must see movie for all movie renters/owners. Grab a box of kleenex and unplug your phone, you won't want to be interrupted during this show.",1184976000,9,1557,4.245791245791246
1392595,5,B00005420H,"I remember watching this film when I was in high school and being blown away by Ann-Margret's performance in it.  I had only ever seen her as the 'sex kitten' type in her previous films and I was so glad I got to see her in this.  This may have been a year prior to her TV performance in 'A Streetcar Named Desire', but I could be wrong.  (Another bravo acting job!)

If I remember correctly it was based on a true story of a dying mother who made sure that she found a proper home(s) for all of her kids before she died.  The story is so moving and actors were all just wonderful.  I would love to see this movie again.

If it isn't available on VHS or DVD it REALLY should be!

p.s. Why isn't there an Ann-Margret box set of films available by now?  What a diverse career!",1144281600,15,774,4.0394736842105265

1392600,4,B00005420H,"""Who Will Love My Children"" is a heart-wrenching story about the immensely difficult decision a terminally ill Mother makes to insure her children live a relatively happy live after she passes. I liked the simplicity of the story implemented by the Director. It was, unlike many movies today, presented without excessive special effects. By focusing the observers attention on the storyline and not distraction of technology the movie kept your attention and stayed intune with one's emotions and compassion for the lead actor's life's trials.",1453248000,2,543,5.4

1392621,5,B00005420H,"I will try not to duplicate other reviews of this incredibly touching True Story of a beautiful, caring, happy and loving Wife and Mother of ten (countem!) 10 beautiful children. Lucile Fray discovers she has an incurable illness. Since her husband, tho he loves his wife and children with his whole heart; has a problem himself that would exclude him from raising their children alone, Lucile spends the remainder of her time on this Earth finding a home for each of her 10 children. Fredric Forest gives a great performance. Ann-Margret's performance was one, if not the BEST, performance of her career. She WAS Lucile Fray. Every scene was spot-on. I must warn you, you will be in tears throughout this movie. And the knowledge that this is a true story, keeps those tears flowing. .I could not stop the flow of tears. the incredible heartbreak both parents and each child felt having to split up one from the other...Traci Gold (Growing Pains) and Solie Moon Frye portrayed 2 of the younger girls. each and ever child actor's performances were impecable. The toddler boy screamed and cried uncontrollably when being taken away from him Mommy and brothers and sisters. It was amazing how this cast bonded so tightly to give such an unforgettable tribute to this amazing woman who put
the future lives of her children above her own pain and suffering. I am convinced no one coul have",1365379200,2,1385,4.799163179916318

I know what I can do but I also know what I can't do.
And I can't credibly review motion picture productions because I simply don't know how to do the work (i.e. I don't know anything about it).
Hence, I don't bother trying to do something that I can't do.
This especially by virtue of the fact that, presently, I have too much frustration in My life already as it is.

1392625,5,B00005420H,"This is the all time tear jerker. Starring Ann-Margret, this is a true story of Lucille Frey. She is a mother of ten children ranging in ages 2-14 years of age. She is married to an alcoholic man with arthritis in his hands, and he's in denial that she is dying of breast cancer. He thinks that life is a bowl of cherries because Lucille always is there for him and his children. The children are all well behaved, and really enjoy life even though they're poor. When Lucille finds out that her cancer can't be cured, she decides to find families for her children in fear that the state will take them away from her husband when she's gone. The first child to be given away is the baby, little Stephen. He is so pitiful when the young couple comes to pick him up to take him home with them. He cries his eyes out as if Ann-Margret is really his mother in real life. I cried right along with him, having kids of my own, I can't imagine giving them away like that. Lucille Frey made sure each child liked the family they went to, and had them go for over-night visits before making her final decision. One by one, the children were given away, and one day Lucille wakes up and imagines her children coming home to see her one last time before she dies, and begs her husband to let her see her kids one more time. He buys her a ticket to travel to each child's new home, and gets to see her kids again for the last time. Later, at Lucille's funeral, the children gather around her grave and notice their father there, standing in the distance, and goes over to see him too. It's so heart wrenching, so grap some tissue and enjoy this true story of love, trust and pure faith. This is a wonderful classic starring Ann-Margret as Lucille Frey.",1260489600,4,1738,4.285714285714286

Sad movies we watch usually have the sad parts at the end of the film. Well this one has sad parts throughout the movie. I can only imagine what the mother went through losing her kids one by one and at the same time dealing with cancer and a alcoholic husband who couldn't keep a steady job due to arthritis and heavy drinking. Such a sad movie it makes you wish nobody ever goes through what this poor family did.",1256515200,4,528,4.12621359223301

Even though I only saw it once or twice, it had been probably 25 years since I had last seen it when I ordered the DVD. This movie stayed with me all those years, and when I saw it again it was just as powerful as I remembered. Ann-Margret was stunning in the role of Lucile Fray, who after a diagnosis of Cancer, makes it her mission to find homes for her 10 children. Based on a true story, this film is heartbreaking and joyous at the same time, mainly due to the beautiful performance by Ann-Margret. Frederic Forrest as Lucile's no-account husband, is at times so unlikable that you won't even realize by the end you care deeply for this very flawed man, and that is due to a very special performance by Forrest. If anyone can finish watching this wonderful TV movie without using an entire box of tissues, than you have to be made of stone....",1469404800,,915,4.234285714285714
