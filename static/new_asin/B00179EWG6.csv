8265451,1,B00179EWG6,"History continues to air this program for some unknown reason. The logic in this show is baffling. No real statements are ever given that a person could latch on to point to the end if the world. All this show does is put forward vague quotes from so called experts that the world will end.

the one time they offered up a real date Dec. 12 2012 we now know is full of crap because the earth didn't end. What a joke. Shows like this are a disservice to any intellect.",1419811200,,467,4.131868131868132
8265452,5,B00179EWG6,This is not doom and gloom. More based on objective facts. Pretty good. The history channel usually has good material.,1309824000,,118,4.95
8265453,5,B00179EWG6,"Do not expect any ""evidence of disastrous consequences"" as the previous reviewer did - take this documentary at face value - please read the Editorial Review.

I personally believe that the History Channel has done an outstanding job delivering this documentary - it is quite remarkable to cover so many topics within only 50 minutes, including the predictions of the Mayan Civilization, the medieval predictions of Merlin, the Book of Revelations, the Chinese oracle of the I Ching, a web-bot crawling the internet to predict the future, balanced analysis of doomsday predictions by respected scholars, views of skeptics, etc.

This is a brief historical overview of available informational materials such as predictions about a possibility of a ""doomsday"" in December of 2012. Please do not expect any miracles from a 50-minute DVD, yet it is an excellent source to provide you with the topics for a further research, if you are interested in researching and studying this matter in depth. Overall, no one can be 100% certain about the future, yet we can be prepared spiritually to withstand an unexpected natural disaster, if any.",1228780800,3,1133,5.1521739130434785
8265454,1,B00179EWG6,"""Doomsday 2012"" focuses on several ""oracles"" that supposedly predict doomsday in 2012, including the Mayan calendar (12/21/12), a web-bot program created to predict stock prices, and with less specificity, an ancient oracle (Sibyl) and I Ching (2,800 B.C. book interpreted in recent years). The Bible's Book of Revelations is also briefly covered, but experts seem to believe that its timing targeted the reign or personage of Nero.

A few esoteric explanations are offered for these insights from oracles - eg. breathing ethylene gas trapped from a long-ago earthquake, etc. More credible explanations focus on the vagueness of most of these predictions. Unfortunately, ""Doomsday 2012"" does not assess the specificity (credibility) of these claims, so viewers are simply left wondering.

Climate change, potential shifting of the earth's magnetic poles are possible - at any time. However, no evidence was offered of the likelihood of disastrous consequences occurring from these sources within the next few years.",1224028800,3,1015,5.584415584415584
