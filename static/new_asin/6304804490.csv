7878754,3,6304804490,This was a pretty good movie. I was a little disappointed that they seemed to center on the drugs in Amsterdam and not the sex.,1365033600,,127,4.12
7878755,5,6304804490,"The people that appear in SEX, DRUGS AND DEMOCRACY dress and act in a distinctly 90s manner, yet the overall message of the film remains just as vitally important today as when it was released in 1994: namely, that the Dutch have a lot to teach the world about tolerance, equality and democracy. Indeed, by comparison, the United States, which touts itself as a shining beacon of liberty and democracy, resembles a police state under harsh draconian laws.",1156464000,2,455,4.846153846153846
7878756,5,6304804490,"I can't tell you how badly I wanted to move to Holland after watching this gem!

I've bought 7 copies to give as presents in the past year.

You really wonder if the USA is the ""land of the free"".

(Holland looks better every day!)

Well made, informal, great editing....love it!

Reefer Madness is one of the cleanest transfers I've seen on DVD.

Hemp for Victory has to be seen to believed. This classic propaganda short begs farmers to start growing dope!

Our navy needed rope for all of the new ships.

Soundtrack bonus CD is tops!",1092355200,8,536,4.453608247422681
7878757,4,6304804490,"This documentary offers a vivid portrait of the Netherlands' permissive social landscape.  Interviewing prostitutes, judges, political leaders, coffeehouse owners, and regular Dutch citizens, filmmaker Jonathan Blank makes the case that decriminalizing ""soft"" drugs and prostitution can advance the public good by freeing government to spend more time on education, prevention, and public health efforts.  Blank ties the film together by presenting excerpts from the Dutch constitution, which frames individual liberties very differently than does the U.S. Constitution.  These excerpts make clear why the Dutch government does not have the authority to legislate morality.  The only flaw in the documentary is that it cheerleads for its political message and fails to document any negatives to the Dutch social arrangement.  It must also be said that this documentary is not for the close-minded or easily offended; be prepared for graphic nudity during the section on pornography and live sex shows.
The bonus features on the DVD are excellent.  Far more amusing than the actual documentary is the black and white film ""Reefer Madness,"" an unintentionally hilarious cautionary tale about how marijuana is sure to transform good citizens into maniacal, murderous thugs.  There's also ""Hemp for Victory,"" a short produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture during World War II to convince farmers that it was their patriotic duty to convert a portion of their land to hemp production.  These two features alone are worth the price of the DVD.",1010102400,8,1545,5.489451476793249
7878758,5,6304804490,"I felt a pull to go to the video store, and this is the video that called me there.
It is a warm and fuzzy video about true (brotherly) love.  It shows how the wisdom that was started out of America made its way only to  the Netherlands.  Out of the whole, ENTIRE world, perhaps the Netherlands  is the only place where the Dalai Lama wouldn't mind living.
I almost  cried while watching.  The prostitutes are cared for and treated like human  beings.  Women are taught how to box, and their championship boxer (female)  says, ""I always box with men.  They're pretty good."" :-D
--But  the most touching thing I saw in it was that people (the govt.) actually  drive around, handing out clean needles to addicts.  --Wow!  What love!  I  have never heard of such a mature society before!
As the Dutch say  repeatedly in the movie, ""If you ignore the problem, it's only going  to get worse.  These people are going to die.""

7878759,5,6304804490,"I first saw Sex Drugs and Democracy 6 years ago, in Canada, upon it's initial release. When it was over I wondered how quickly I could get from the movie theatre to the airport. Six years later, after watching the film  for the second time, my wife and I wondered how quickly we could get to the  airport from our bedroom.  This is a movie about FREEDOM. This is a movie  about FREEDOM and CIVILIZATION and RESPONSIBILITY and FEARLESSNESS. And  WISDOM.  It is wisdom born out of a common sense notion about what human  beings need to reach their individual and communal potential, as well as a  refreshing trust in their ability to acheive that potential without  creating chaos. In the USA we give freedom lip service.  In Holland Freedom  is a solid thing to be touched by all. This movie is REVOLUTIONARY. After  watching it you'll know why Blockbuster doesn't carry it. And, after you  have watched it, been turned on by it, you too will ask: Why am I still  here?",949017600,11,968,4.520231213872832
7878760,5,6304804490,"It is extremely difficult to review a video(especially one such as this) in merely a few words. On the surface this a documentary that unfolds the social and political structures that make Holland what it is from both a  fundamental historical perspective and a modern day to day perspective as  told through interviews with every kind of person you can imagine.  As far  as what I got out of this video...All I can really say is that I found this  documentary to be enlightening in the fullest sense of the word. The video  watches like a 'how to succeed in running your country' manual...and  watching this video will convince you that the Dutch have it down pat!  I  believe that everyone would like to change (fix?) the world and this video  serves to add fuel to that fire within. Anyone with the slightest interest  in how society, the world and people just getting along works should watch  this...you will be pleasantly enthralled and in the process discover that  there is hope for the world yet!",918518400,9,1005,4.674285714285714
