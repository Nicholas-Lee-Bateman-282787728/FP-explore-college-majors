2788545,5,B000NY1E94,"Our friends at Anchor Bay have taken it upon themselves to release, along with ABCKO films, 2 of Alejandro Jodorowsky's brilliant works, El Topo and this film, The Holy Mountain.  On this film, Jodorowsky was given carte blanche and a 1.5 million dollar budget, making it the most expensive Mexican film to date.  Like El Topo, it became an underground hit, and it's even better than El Topo.  The production values are better, the widescreen framing of Jodorowsky is amazing at times, and the film is just like a mad painting come to life.  There is no real point at attempting to discover anything resembling a plot, as these things are not important.  The imagery here is outstanding, and it is nice to see The Holy Mountain without any digital censorship (my copy is a VHS dub from a Japanese laserdisc, and there was optical censorship of pubic areas, because pubic hair was not able to be shown in Japan, which was very annoying and quite bizarre, but censors have a tendency to be weird).  This is my favorite Jodorowsky film, one that you should be SOBER when you watch it.  Everyone will tell you to trip to it, but the movie itself is the trip, and that's the only trip y'all have to take.",1174262400,21,1199,4.5488372093023255
2788546,1,B000NY1E94,"It is difficult to feel sorry for millionaires.  Therefore, feeling sorry for the Beatles for having allowed Allan Klein to swindle them out of the money to produce the most inane, ridiculously idiotic film of all time (Plan 9 From Outer Space is pure genius next to this contrived junk) results in the instant karma, as John Lennon so famously put in one of his better songs, to suit several lifetimes.

The only reason why I watched this stupidity was because of an interesting segment on NPR about Jodorowsky's attempt to make Frank Herbert's Dune.  One of my favorite books, by the way.  Therefore, I thought I'd check him out by watching one of Jodorowsky's films, talk about bad decisions.

Unfortunately, the Amazon rating system only allows for one star as the lowest valuation.  If it were up to me I'd give it a zero or a minus. Anyone who believes this film is of any value has been to too many avant-garde, NYC pretentious art shows.  If you are dumb enough to spend the money they're asking to buy this crap then you deserve to be swindled -- along with the Beatles.  Good luck!",1397865600,,1091,4.558974358974359
2788547,4,B000NY1E94,"Not sure why the BluRay version is over $200 when it was released just over a year ago.

2788548,5,B000NY1E94,"This is one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. I watched it the first time very randomly. At first I wanted to dismiss it as artsy BS. However, I was never completely able to and as the movie went on I was alble to see the 'grand vision' of Alejandro Jodorowsky.

2788550,5,B000NY1E94,Remarkable film.  Sui generis.  By a visionary director who later became a Parisian shaman.  Jodorowsky shows the psychedelic large-screen spectacle that he managed to create before the era of computer-generated special effects.  The scenes are works of art.  My only warning would be that the pace is slow for today's attention-deficited audiences.,1385769600,,349,5.634615384615385

2788552,2,B000NY1E94,"This movie is VERY strange.
If you want to eat a bunch of mushrooms and watch it, it would probably be more enjoyable.
I guess a lot of stuff passed for art back in the 70s.
Visually is was great, the story's idea was compelling but the actors and director on this one just didn't pull it all together.",1366934400,,302,4.135593220338983
2788553,4,B000NY1E94,I love Jorodowsky. That probably says more about me than I should share. This was pretty good but did not quite measure up to El Topo,1365465600,,133,4.153846153846154

2788556,3,B000NY1E94,"I first encountered this film on laserdisc in a Japanese print which ""fuzzed out"" sexual body parts.  The film, however, was rated  ""Not
Rated.""  Then I finally found the Anchor Bay DVD (in the boxed set of Jodorowsky films) and the film, again, was rated ""Not Rated.""  Now I
purchased the blu-ray edition of the film, again from Anchor Bay, and it is rated ""R.""  As this is not a film I watch on an regular basis -
and not one that I want to watch twice in a night to see if there is any difference between the R and Not Rated versions - I am just wondering
if anyone has seen both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions and can tell me if there is a major difference.  And, I do wonder why the change in
ratings as both versions are listed at the same running time and presented by the same distributor, Anchor Bay.

Just a thought!

As to the movie - most the the reviews are spot on, so I will not add anything here.  But, still, why the rating change?",1359244800,,946,4.0978260869565215
2788557,5,B000NY1E94,"Aside from being beautiful, enigmatic and instructive, this movie is the source of many elements that you will see in other films.  It also contains elements that are an homage, I believe, to Kenneth Anger...my opinion.  It is a fascinating film, and si something like the style of Satyricon.",1355788800,,292,4.938775510204081
2788558,5,B000NY1E94,"This movie is really far out there, you need an open mind to appreciate the art side of the movie. With that being said, I have an open mind... and this movie was awesome, creative, weird, disgusting, perverse, and oh so good. Best served with fungus. :)",1355788800,,254,4.425531914893617
2788559,5,B000NY1E94,"Its very difficult to put into mere words a full on explanation of Jodorowsky's 'Holy Mountain'.  It is without a doubt exceptional and is filled to the brim with visual motifs that explore society's attitudes towards sexuality, violence, commercialism, capitalism, religion, war, as well as exploring a journey towards self-enlightenment in order to achieve true immortality.

The very first time I watched this film, I was blown away because it was one of the purest examples of cinema as art, and while there isn't a great deal of dialogue spoken in the film, the visuals and actions that take place on screen speak just as loudly as any dialogue.  And what little dialogue there is, is very well written.

The film is a surreal experience, but it is also very much a psychadelic trip into a realm where intellect, instinct and imagination are joined together as one.  While the film may not be to everyone's tastes, I still highly recommend this film to all lovers of cinema who seek something a little different from the norm.",1349568000,,1031,4.8352272727272725

This movie is unparalleled. If you are into psychedelic experiences, then this is a must see. Of all of Jodorowsky's films, this one is clearly the greatest.",1349308800,,172,4.931034482758621
2788561,5,B000NY1E94,"Another trip inside the mind of Alejandro Jodorowsky. This director is in a classification I like to call psychedelic spiritualism. El Topo is Jodorowsky's crowning achievement, but this one should be viewed also and more times than one. If you are into art house films, then this one is for you. If not you might not ever get it even after multiple viewings. Prepare for a trip.",1344643200,,379,4.6716417910447765
2788562,5,B000NY1E94,"A few years ago a friend pushed this movie on me. I sat down one night (alone), and attempted to watch it. Immediately the beginning told me this was going to be a uncomfortable movie to watch. Like some other reviews, i made it in about 20 minutes, that's with my mouth gaped open, pretty much shocked the entire time. I took a break and went back to watching it, the whole movie was pretty visually disturbing to watch, and when the movie was over i was pretty confused about what the hell i had just watched. Throughout the entire 2 hours of this movie, i do not think it goes more than 2 minutes without visual offense, but not in the typical way. I won't try to explain this film, but their is a definite message in it going on about religion, violence, greed, and power. It also seemed that their is something going on from a hallucinogenic perspective, at least in my opinion. Basically, make sure you are not offended easily if your going to watch it, and try to remember it is an artistic endeavor. It didn't become my favorite movie ever, as a matter of fact, i haven't watched again all the way through since, but i didn't think it was bad, and appreciated it for what it was; a very unique art film. I really think of it as a moving piece of art, no more offensive than a Hieronymus Bosch painting would be to see in motion for 2 hours. I am by no means an art critic, not even an artist (i am a musician, but that's a bit different, isn't it), but i feel this isn't really a bad film, but guaranteed to either highly interest, or highly offend. Just a sidnote; i tried to watch El Topo, and had a completely reversed reaction, it bored me to death.",1333584000,,1661,4.242902208201893
2788563,1,B000NY1E94,Excellent movie what I can remember because I can't play it in our region and the type of disk was not clear at the point of sale which is very disappointing,1328313600,2,157,4.096774193548387
2788564,5,B000NY1E94,"If you're out looking for a movie to watch for the sake of finding something ""weird"", DO NOT get this movie. This is not a movie for people who get kicks searching out crazy intense surreal movies. This movie can't be taken at face ""shock"" value. The use of imagery, allegory and metaphors is staggering. Someone unprepared could be so shocked as to cast it into the realm of trashy ""art-house"" crap, which I don't believe it is (though it is artistic, as I belive all movies should be). It takes a certain kind of person to appreciate a movie like this, and I'm not saying that to be pretentious as I belive all types of films have their niche (audience). So when I say this movie is not for everyone. I mean it. If you're not prepared to see sexually twisted gratuitous religious symbolism paralelling humanity linking the mystism of tribal cultures to modern society, than this movie is not for you.

Though that being said this movie will certainly evoke a reaction.

First off, this movie is a satire to such a degree that it's almost impossible to see as a movie. In other words, where most satires can be interpreted literally, such as, A Clockwork Orange, South Park, Johnathan Swift's A Modern Proposal, ect. ect. This movie can not. So if you're apt to enjoy more literal movies and think of things in literal ways, or if you enjoy debating semantics, this movie is NOT going to be for you. All warnings aside, maybe I should explain what I think the movie is about.

Spoiler Alert: . . . just kidding, even if I were to describe scene by scene this movie, it wouldn't do you any good.

Brief Synopsis:

First off there is a guy who is kind of like Jesus, but not any Jesus you know. He is like our own personal metaphysical Jesus. The Jesus that lives inside all of us. He tries to discover the meaning of life, by seeking out a (spirit guide, shaman, alchemist, preist . . . insert whatever role you see here), and then he meets with a team of other people who represent simultaneously, the planets, feminism, masculinism, corporitism, spiritulaism, fascism and any other -ism that you can think of. He then makes a spiritual journey with these ""people"" (or chakra's or psychological constructs of id, ego, superego, anima, animus, shadow, or horoscopes or all of the above ect.) to conquer the holy mountian. And when you think Holy Mountain, think that symbol of the pyramid with the trancendent eye at the top. Think wise man on top of a mountain. Think Maslow's heirarchy of needs. Think actually mountains. Think Mt. Everest. Think all of that at the exact same time. So as You/Jesus/Everyone/All the Animals in the world/The Universe, climb and reach the peak of the Holy Mountain you discover, nothing . . . everything . . . mindfreak. Credits. Congratualation you have just been raped.

So if you're the type of person who enjoys the abstract with discussions of religion, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, symbolism, absurd humor, black comedies, surreal art, psychedelics, corporate satires, and commercialized parodies of Jesus with plenty of nudity and not always supermodel sexuality. If you can see the horrible and grotesque as humorus and downright insightful about the human condition than you may enjoy this movie. If there is one peice of that puzzle that you don't really care much about, than I would reccomend you steer clear of this movie.

I like this movie, but I know not everyone will. This is not a movie I would loan out on a whim. If a friend of mine saw it on my shelf and asked to borrow it, I would have to consider their tastes and levels of egocentrism, their ablity to think in abstracts, their sense of humor, their religious beliefs, their appreciation for philosophy and their mood and motivation for wanting to watch it. Where as, loaning out a movie for me is typically a nonchalant ""Sure, here you go"", in the case of this movie, I couldn't do it. I haven't seen a single movie that I could say that about. Other weird movies I might take some things into consideration before loaning them out, but this movie I would have to take the most into consideration. I could more easily loan a fetish porn film to my Grandmother than I could loan The Holy Mountain to a close friend who's favorite movies are romantic comedies and 70s horror.

I hope this helps.",1315008000,4,4313,4.636125654450262
2788565,4,B000NY1E94,"Alejandro seems to always try to scare away shallow people in the first part of his films and then for those who sat through all of the things that usually make commoners hurl, upchuck, guffaw and beat their breast in outrage and agony, then and only then, does he begin laying down the foundation for a very relevant,very sane and very coherent story that does not seem odd or dangerous at all. It was like this in ""Santa Sangre"" also. An Irregular director with a lot to say.",1314403200,3,477,4.431818181818182
2788566,4,B000NY1E94,"Help me figure this out. Does it still contain all the images of genitals,a-holes and everything?I mean it's pretty strong to be released as R-rated. I own the bitish Tartan release and it runs 110 min in the PAL version. Usually a version in the NTSC release,talking about a 90 min movie is 4 min. longer. When it comes to a movie that runs nearly two hours the difference can add up to nearly 5 minutes. The american version of the holy mountain is only three (3) minutes longer then the PAL movie. So I'm thinking maybe there is a minute or ninety seconds missing somewhere along the road.  Please comment if you know something I don't.",1311897600,2,639,4.461538461538462
2788567,4,B000NY1E94,"Jodorowsky's 1973 follow up to the modestly budgeted, full-frame formatted EL TOPO was the high-budget, wide-screen psychedelic allegory THE HOLY MOUNTAIN.

Jodorowsky claimed he prepared for the film by undergoing a psycho-spiritual boot camp, training in the spritual arts and rituals that induced a week of sleep-deprivation.  It was all under the supervision of a Zen masters with regular LSD trips guided by a guru.  Prior to shooting the film, the crew lived in isolation under jodorowsky's direction for a month.

Visually and viscerally, the hi-def transfer is a masterwork that benefited greatly the labor intensive 2K scan restoration which hugely enhanced the movie's color palate from its original release.

If I recall correctly, when it was screened at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, riots broke out in response to Jodorowsky's flood of sacrilegious imagery and existential symbolism.

THE HOLY MOUNTAIN chronicles a quest for enlightenment, pitting illusion against the truth as The Alchemist (Jodorowsky), assembles a group of people from all walks oif life to represent the planets in the solar system.  Strange and provocative mystical rites divest them of their worldly baggage as they ascend the Holy Mountain to displace the immortal gods who secretly(?) rule the universe.

2788571,5,B000NY1E94,"Playful and deep, this film marks the full coming-of-age of the long tradition of surrealist film-making.  Don't get me wrong ... I love Buuel's work (for example), but Jodorowski brings a simplicity - an almost-too-obvious yet at the same time profoundly elegant approach - to the cinematographic experiment which had been lacking hitherto.  The playful push-and-pull dynamic he creates with the viewer yields an experience much more expansive than the confines of the screen.  ""The Holy Mountain"" evokes the essenceless beauty of being, and taps something deeply personal no matter how many times we've been to the summit; if you look to film for something more than diversion, this one is a must-see.",1297814400,2,703,5.20353982300885

There has never been nor will ever be anything else like it.  Even if you don't like it, you will never  forget it.  Jodorowski's cinematic vision places him in the same class as Luis Bunuel, Frederico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, and Igmar Bergman.

It's about a man who sort of is like Christ, walking around a world that is a bit nutty. With his rebellious nature, and a bit of a dark side, he's drawn to some abstract goal that isn't really apparent yet. Climbing  a tower, he meets his Guide, his Master, his Guru. who , through alchemy, transforms this man into a more purified being. then he introduces him to 8 powerful people and their mission is to go to a mountain to become immortal by killing the 9 immortals living there. but it doesn't end there. that is only the beginning :)",1238803200,2,711,4.419847328244275

Not much to lose if not spending a hip of money on this DVD.",1220140800,2,322,5.44
2788578,3,B000NY1E94,"Contrary to the description, this is NOT the full version that played in theaters year ago.  Two of the most famous scenes have been edited down.  Specifically, the most graphic footage of the exploding frogs that were forced to swallow cherry bombs has been clipped.  And the famous ""dwarf tossing"" scene now ends before the dwarf hits the water.

If you think filming people with bugs crawling on their face represents High Art, then fasten your seatbelt and open your mouth.  You are about to be treated to a big steaming bowl full of ART!

According to the Director, ""Holy Mountain"" is not supposed to entertain you, but to help bring you to ""Enlightenment"".  The Director is a ""Performance Artist""  who once made money by charging people to watch him kill live animals on stage.  There is a certain amount of such ""Art"" in this movie.

Although some of the scenes blatantly attempt to outdo Fellini as bizare spectacle, Fellini movies are in a completely different category because his films have actual believable characters and dialog.  There are no real characters or, for that matter, plot elements in this film.  All the persons who appear are ""Symbols"".  People symbolize planets, tarot cards, zodiac signs, etc.  Watching these symbols is supposed to help bring you to Enlightenment.  That is, if you are willing to sit humbly at the feet and receive wisdom from a guy who tortures animals on stage and film for money.  If not, ""you just don't get it, Dude.""

If you didn't realize that climbing a mountain can be a symbol representing the quest for enlightenment, you might learn something from this film.  But if you already knew that, there is not much in it except for watching some strange scenes.  The first half is very artfully photographed, but later on it becomes incredibly lame and amateurish.  In the last part, the actors/symbols ""confront their fears""  by having bugs crawl over their bodies, etc.  Do you remember the scenes in Ed Wood's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glen-or-Glenda/dp/B00003XAMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glen or Glenda</a>"" where he gets his transvestite friends together to wear outlandish clothes and make faces at the camera?

There are differing Schools of Enlightenment.

One holds that Enlightenment has something to do with treating people kindly and positioning one's self to do some good in the world.

But the School of Enlightenment here is related to getting naked, meditating on New Age symbols, shocking people by desecrating their beloved traditional symbols, sacrificing animals, confronting your worst fears, climbing mountains, burning fecal matter, and tossing dwarfs into the ocean.

The beginning scene exploits two drug addled girls who appear naked without pay because they thought it would make them movie stars.  If you are uncomfortable with the idea of putting handicapped people into freak shows, you will not be able to escape the evil stench of exploitation that hangs over this production.

Did you know that tossing a dwarf/amputee into the Gulf of Mexico is a symbol of ""getting rid of your monstrosity""?  That is Jodo's interpretation of a scene that been partially cut from recent versions of the film.  Some might interpret this as ""practicing your monstrosity""  or ""exhibiting your monstrosity for all the world to see"".

There is a commentary track by Jodo, which I actually enjoyed.  Definitely listen to this commentary, even if you don't ever watch with the real soundtrack.  Like most people who live to be 70, Jodo has acquired something at least tangentially related to wisdom, and he comes off as an entertaining old crank.  His reminiscence of the making of the film is interesting history of a by-gone age.  He takes credit for many of the innovations that make life in the 21st Century so pleasant, such as self reproducing machines, the Internet, and Body Art. Jodorowsky sees himself as a person who has done great things for the human race.  He claims that in this film, he ""solved humanity's problems with War and Homosexuality"".  If he has any second thoughts about the treatment of the animals, he fails to mention them.  And he is completely oblivious to what a truly bad film this is.  He does not talk much about the amputee who played the main supporting actor role.  Is it vain to hope that Jodorowsky paid that guy enough to take care of his needs for the rest of his life?",1211846400,12,4422,5.019230769230769
2788579,5,B000NY1E94,"I got me a copy of Combe's Jerome Bosch (Tisne, Paris,1917) with every minute detail of Garden of Delights and other top works examined on a separate page.  Bird-pecked strawberry arschen and the like.  And a similar Gruenwald edition... all down to pig-bristle scrapings of paint made in plague-ridden years.  Goya carbon-sketched down at this level during his plague-time - minute studies.

This is the level of detail imagined in Holy Mountain - and also wonderfully scored with pig-bristle music over moving figures. This is a necessary step forward of the genre in our bulbous projection era, done 35 years back and rarely if ever exceeded.

Pretensions aside - studying tarot, zen, dead deptford men with dialogue  no more - Chutney sez it gotta come down to sensory images, aural and visual now.  And this film is striding atop with I think no pretensions at all.  Pan out, and pantasm.

There's this one minute zen thing by Cage where one monk carries a girl across a stream, and later is remining the moment(agin-biting-his-inwit).  Two monk says, 'But you put her down one hour ago.'  I feel the guilt of one monk when I reflect on my viewing of Holy Mountain.  It was a string of moments... but I cannot give some of em up.

What is that Greenaway film based on time-lapsing the decomposition of living things - 'Z00' or something?  This is the feeling I have when watching the great Plague Artists at work.

This film has been unavailable to the sensory public for more than 30 years.  And soon enough the infrastructure will fall apart and projected images and sounds available only to a few, unsensory, toads.

Library of Alexandria they say was a good one. O, burn it all.

But...it being made in the 70's, like alot of good films came from, it deserves more praise and attention than most movies.  The symbolism is great.  The visuals are amazing!  It truely is a ride.  A ride like none other.  I'll use just a couple of enticing words: ""psychedelic shot guns"", ""weapons that induce delusions of granduer"", ""poo into gold"", ""animals you've never seen"" and...""Jesus smokin a doobie"". Now, if those things don't tickle your fancy, then don't even bother watching this film.  But let me just say...it WILL change how you view alot of the things you've held dearly throughout life.  Oh, and make sure to watch the Tarot feature in the special features, you won't be a let down!  I give this film as many stars that there are in the heavens.

2788581,1,B000NY1E94,"this movie is overly random and allegorical to the point of ridiculous absurdity.  Holy Mountain isn't really even a movie, it's a visual documentary of the director's artistic rambling that tries to be ironic, provocative, amusing, bizarre, surrealistic, and poignant.  and tries too hard, in my view.  while some of the visuals were appealing, there was no story and no plot.

after a decent beginning, i couldn't wait for this thing to end.

Watching his films is like giving a camera to the homeless, toothless guy who rants and raves about Jesus having a UFO stashed in a garbage can behind a Dairy Queen in some remote Arizona town.

Art is entirely subjective, so with that in mind, this is the most hilarious attempt at surreal ""art""; at trying to get the audience to open up to ""another state of consciousness"", (more gold from the burn out.)

And come on, how is this thing even remotely offensive?  (I don't know, maybe it's because I'm an atheist)  Oh man, THERE'S FLAMING JESUS POO!!!!! because it symbolizes this, and symbolizes that, and this symoblizes a monkey with a hippo in a pool and some black chick with whacky zany tattoos.

2788583,4,B000NY1E94,"El Topo is better known, but The Holy Mountain is the best film of surreal master Alejandro Jodorowski (born in Chile, based in Mexico during his film career and now living in France as a comic book artist).  Shot in luscious color, this little known masterpiece was unavailable for viewing for decades, due to a dispute between the director and the producer. To describe what the movie is about is close to a meaningless exercise: let's just say that after a series of outrageous visual gags (the conquest of Mexico as performed by frogs?), some kind of plot emerges, as the Alchemist (Jodorowski himself) assembles a group of people named after planets (?) in order to prepare them to climb a sacred hill for some world threatening event. And when one less expects it, the movie's fourth wall emerges, in the film's funniest gag. This is free association surrealism: Jodorowski throws about ten visual jokes per minute, about only one really works, but this means you can stop laughing and marveling all the time. The movie is also highly sacrilegious and scatological, so it is obviously not for everyone.",1187740800,2,1108,4.862433862433862
2788584,3,B000NY1E94,"I watched El Topo immediately upon buying the Alejandro Jodorowsky DVDs a month or so ago.  I've made the assertion that El Topo is one of my favorite movies ever made in a prior review, and The Holy Mountain was waiting in the wings.  I have seen The Holy Mountain before but I only owned a Japanese bootleg.  So I've had plenty of time to work out my ideas toward what The Holy Mountain is about and I do believe it justifies more than one or two viewings.  I've never understood this film but I figured it was because I didn't try as hard at understanding it as I did with El Topo.  However, at this point I've exhausted all my efforts and I will admit that with the Holy Mountain I'm stumped.  I have no idea what this movie is trying to say.

The Holy Mountain opens with our protagonist, the thief who looks like Jesus Christ, befriending a deformed dwarf.  A bunch of wax versions of the thief looking crucified are created and distributed throughout the community and the thief eats the face off of one of them and ties it to a bunch of balloons.  The character played by Jodorowsky, the alchemist, summons the thief to approach his giant tower.  There at the alchemist's tower, we are introduced to seven people whose names reference some of the nine planets.  The alchemist urges them to destroy their material things and then they all go to the Holy Mountain.  When they get there, Jodorowsky speaks to the cast, the crew and the audience outside of the context of the film.  He says that we should leave the Holy Mountain and that real life is awaiting us.

The Holy Mountain has flashes of the religious allegorical commentary that Jodorowsky makes in El Topo, but here perhaps his brushes are too broad for me to pick up on.  I'm not saying the film can't be deciphered and that theorizing what the film is about is not worth your time, but not enough made sense to me here to give the movie credit for its story.  There are some really great scenes that comment here and there in ways I could follow, but the film's overall scope seems out of reach if it is present at all.  Perhaps that is my fault, but if there is an overall commentary being made then I partially blame Jodorowsky for not provoking me enough to discover it.

It is a visually exciting movie but because I couldn't follow much of it, some of the film's content came off as intentionally shocking.  In The Holy Mountain, Jodorowsky seems to turn up the volume on some of the elements I thought were border-line gratuitous in El Topo.  Firstly, the aforementioned issues of too much fuzzy imagery and broad brush strokes and that is something that might fundamentally corrupt my review if we are to assume that the point went over my head.  Secondly, there is quite a bit of full frontal nudity in this movie from both genders and some of it is more graphic than what we might see in R-rated movies today, but I guess that is a sign of the times.  Thirdly, what is it with Jodorowsky and castration?  Not to mention poop?  Anyway, tid-bits of this movie are interesting and it is like nothing I have ever seen before, so for that I will recommend The Holy Mountain, but that doesn't mean it deserves a higher rating.",1185753600,16,3198,4.436643835616438
2788585,5,B000NY1E94,"I would say the first scene alone is better than the entire film ""el topo"" (which was by no means a bad film). I watched the two back to back. Theres nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said before. The only thing that might turn you off is that you can tell at times that this was made in the 70's, and certain moments seem campy, if thats the right word, like something from a john waters film, but there are only a few moments, such as the woman with green hair (and pubes). I had this same feeling when watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, the beginning of which is the greatest film I have ever seen (beautiful and timeless), but once you see the space station and I guess the way that they viewed the future back then, its way too 70's and retro (like wood paneling on the instruments, which looked like Moog synthesizers) I couldn't even finish the film. But just when I start to feel the movie is losing its momentum, something comes along to make me realize that the director knew what he was doing (ie. the green haired woman sitting on a very tall toilet). This movie had me laughing out loud at many points, not because I found it particulary funny, but just because of how bizarre and surreal certain moments were. It was laughter out of joy.

I will admit that I just bought this yesterday and have yet to finish it (I was watching it late at night and kept nodding off and having to rewind it), but I have seen enough to write this.",1184284800,2,1457,4.241007194244604
2788593,5,B000NY1E94,"This film defies categorization. A live-action version of Harry Smith's HEAVEN AND EARTH MAGIC is the best summary I can come up with. Throw in references to THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SEVENTH SEAL, Tod Browning's FREAKS, THE TRIP and SALO: 120 DAYS OF SODOM and you may begin to get the idea. I nearly turned the weird thing off near the beginning, but be patient.

Warning: THE HOLY MOUNTAIN contains scenes of shockingly graphic violence and other disturbing imagery that will haunt your dreams. Make sure the kids are in bed.

Technically, the film transfer is excellent, with a very sharp 2.35 anamorphic picture, fine color and no sign of wear. The soundtrack is in true stereo and sounds terrific.

But this one is heads and shoulders (or severed head and shoulders, if you will) above the rest. Even the previous most bizarre film I had ever seen - Sweet Movie - was blown away by this film in terms of sheer weirdness and discontinuity.

I would go along with the ""see it on drugs"" recommendation. I am giving it two stars instead of one because it looks good (love the set in the opening scene), and because I was very impressed with the climbing-the-obelisk scene. Apart from that, I just found the storyline to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too artsy for my tastes, plus there were some disturbing scenes with dead animals and too many limbless (or partially limbless) people running and/or hobbling around.",1180224000,7,868,4.636363636363637
2788596,5,B000NY1E94,"""the best surrealistic piece of celluloid in all creation""?  Actually, I would award that particular title to Santa Sangre-- though I would grant The Holy Mountain a close second-- though perhaps I am splitting hairs here...

What is the movie about?  Some may interpret it as Jodorowsky's version of Siddhartha's journey.  I prefer to think of it as a grandiloquent representation of a simple conversation expressed most concisely by two of Robert Crumb's characters-- Flakey Foont asks, ""What does it all mean?"" to which Mr. Natural responds, ""It don't mean s#*t!""

Jodorowsky's visuals in fact, ask questions that have no answers, except for the apologetics created by those who's discomfort in uncertainty requires an artificial reality.  And these are questions that are rarely asked, as it raises that discomfort level present in many societal institutions.  Not only that, Jodorowsky is able to do all this keeping it light-hearted and with a sense of humor-- something that would probably further exacerbate the discomfort in many.  The Holy Mountain is a journey well worth taking only if you aren't one of those who wears beliefs on your sleeve.

The opening scene really deserves to be seen on the big screen-- the impact is stunningly phenomenal in such a way that is unfortunately pretty hard to reproduce with NTSC or PAL television equipment.  But as one who couldn't wait a couple of years ago and ordered the Raro video release direct from Italy, I anxiously await the arrival of this restored version into my collection, placing my order for it as I write this review...

-- Just got my order and took the opportunity to do a little comparison of the video quality of this ABKCO release with the earlier RARO VIDEO Italian release.  This ABKCO release CLEARLY shows that the restoration was a success-- the quality of the image is FAR better than the RARO VIDEO version.  It was well worth the money to upgrade to a higher quality print-- the ABKCO restoration was a digital color correction + a few other things, apparently at 2K resolution and it shows-- NICE picture compared with the VHS-like RARO release.  There's a brief discussion piece of the restoration process in the extras with some side-by-side comparisons, and I can vouch for the fact that the left-side images in the comparisons are similar to the RARO release.

Now if someone would do the same sort of restoration to Woiciech J. Has' ""Sanatorium pod klepsydra"" (Hour Glass Sanatorium from Bruno Schulz), my collection of favorite surrealist films would be mostly complete (which includes Fellini, Jan Svankmajer, the Brothers Quay, Veit Helmer, Guy Maddin, Marc Caro, Terry Gilliam, and I'm sure quite a few others that I can't think of at the moment)...

I still can't quite believe that such a film was ever made, though I've long sensed that such a film should be. While not overtly violent, The Holy Mountain is punctuated by graphic, shocking and heretical images, but these only form one aspect of its jaw-dropping resonance. Jodorowsky's film is original, audacious, visually and thematically inspired. It's also kind of funny.

In essence the film is a series of literalized metaphors about the archetypal spiritual journey to experience reality beyond illusion, a quest motivated by a desire to transcend the absurd horrors of civilization: war, greed, corruption, self-obsession and the politics of power. As such the characters and events themselves are largely symbolic. Unlike a lot of avant-garde films, Holy Mountain's narrative is structured and surprisingly linear, though it flowers like a rambling, slightly disjointed dream.

Jodorowsky's spiritual path is an unflinching synthesis of the basic conceptual and aesthetic elements of many mystical traditions, including Zen's formal simplicity, Kabbalic and Hindu ritual, Alchemical processes, Shamanic trials, master/student dynamics and the mythology of the Holy Mountain itself, all of which are gracefully blended into the artful and psychedelic texture of the film.

Despite the clichd ""ancient wisdom"" aspect of some moments, The Holy Mountain achieves what is a fairly fresh and ultimately tongue-in-cheek attempt to enlighten the audience. Sometimes the pacing and editing of the film feel a little dated, but this usually adds to the film's unique style rather than diminish it. The Holy Mountain is an ambitious film, provocative in its boldness and charming in its outlandishness, and traveling with these seekers will undoubtedly color our own journeys, both inner and outer...",1177459200,51,2007,5.552287581699346

2788602,5,B000NY1E94,"I have now purchased a copy of The Films of Alejandro Jodorowski and I give this film even a higher recommendation than I did before.  The DVD is superb, and it's a nice plus to run Jodorowski's commentary track as subtitles on the film itself, since the commentary is in Spanish anyway.

El Topo was about a man seeking enlightenment and was made before Jodorowsky had ever smoked marijuana or taken LSD. The Holy Mountain is the attempt to enlighten the entire society. To prepare, he found a Guru, who gave him LSD. Then after he had gathered his cast, he took them on a three month retreat to prepare, and the film itself seems to have taken six months to shoot. When I met Jodorowsky in 2003, he called El Topo his favorite son; The Holy Mountain his troubled son; and Santa Sangre his perfect son. All three are essential works. Jodorowsky truly is Alexandro the Great.

Holy Mountain is not about being high, it is about seeing through all illusions, of which getting high very much is one of those illusions. It is a huge satire of the modern world in which the Alchemist (played by Alexandro himself) finds the most horrible people in the solar system, and then takes them on a quest that pacifies them by promising immortality - just like the regular religions!

For a film that does not go ""inside"" any of the characters -- we see them in beautifully framed compositions -- it is very easy to follow and never lets the viewer down. In the end, he even reveals the secret of immortality. ""And here we are -- mortals, more human than ever.""

I think I should note that Richard Rutowski, who worked with Oliver Stone on several of his most interesting works (like The Doors, Nixon, and U Turn), plays the character Axon.

I believe The Holy Moutain may be the most perfect Utopian vision ever put on film.
