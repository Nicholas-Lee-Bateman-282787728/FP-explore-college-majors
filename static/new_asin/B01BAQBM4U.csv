7624119,5,B01BAQBM4U,These workouts are killer!!  Love it.  Buy it.  You will not be disappointed,1474070400,,76,4.6923076923076925
7624120,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Jillian Michaels never disappoints me!  I am a huge JM fan, and I own every single DVD she has produced (except for the postnatal one).  So, my review may be a bit biased; but hey, I'm a huge JM fan for a reason, because her workouts WORK!

I loved every single workout on this DVD, and I love how it comes with a warm up & cool down.  I love being able to mix and match these workouts, allowing me to design a workout that suits my schedule.

I absolutely HATE Pilates workouts, but surprisingly this one was awesome!  I actually really enjoyed it and I will definitely keep it in my rotation.

For the past few months, I've ventured towards different workouts (like beachbody), and I've forgotten how much I enjoy JM workouts.  This DVD reminded me how much fun exercise can be (no offense to beachbody).  So, I'm now doing another round of JM Ripped in 30 (one of my all time favorites).

I really hope Jillian comes out with another 30 day DVD program like 30 day shred & Ripped in 30!!!",1473638400,11,991,4.308108108108108
7624121,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Let me just say, even though the workouts are broken down into 10 minute increments, they pack a lot punch. The DVD does not have a 'play all' option, but you start with your warm-up, and choose a workout from there. I like that setup, personally. She's more mellow in this one, not the 'in your face' Jillian that I'm accustomed to. I'm more of an intermediate exercisor, and these workouts had sweat running off of me in rivulets. I'm particularly fond of the kickboxing and Pilates segments. You can't go wrong with any of her workouts, and this one is no exception.",1473638400,5,569,4.533980582524272
7624122,5,B01BAQBM4U,"I love every single workout on here. It's perfect, because the days you just want to do 10 or even 20 minutes you just do 2 of the workouts and the days you want more do more of them. I love the Pilates on this DVD that is the most effective Pilates workout I have ever done. Jillian, you should make a longer Pilates workout on your next DVD because I loved it. I have all of the Winsor Pilates workouts and none of them matched up to this 10 minute one. I love Jillian she is to me by far the best trainer thru DVD workouts I have all of her workouts this is now 1 of my very favorites.",1473638400,7,588,3.8677685950413223
7624123,5,B01BAQBM4U,Im a big fan of JM..I love this dvd! Nice fast effective workout especially when I have kids and school! Its a nice change from her 3-2-1 system!,1473638400,,145,4.214285714285714
7624124,5,B01BAQBM4U,This is a tough one. I haven't done all of the workouts and I have to admit that at 54 I cannot do all of the moves she does. She does offer modifications which is always good. My favorite so far is the kickboxing since I began my passion for DVD workouts about 16 years ago with taebo. My problem area is my upper body so kickboxing is an excellent workout for me to try and reduce the post menopausal belly area. There are several combos that really work the core and upper body area. I would love to see another kickboxing DVD from Jillian with 10 to 15 minute workouts that can be done separately or combined. Kickbox Fastfix is one of my fave DVDs by Jillian.,1472774400,9,664,4.1953125
7624125,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Jillian has another winner! This is a great DVD to mix in with her other programs! There are five ten minute workouts that I think are all awesome, plus there is a separate warm up and cool down, each about 2-3 minutes, so you're really looking at 15 minutes to get through on workout. Calisthenics is probably not very beginner friendly, even the modifications are hard - think phase two of her Body Shred program. For me, it's exciting, for a beginner, it's probably daunting. Kickboxing is cardio and anybody could punch and kick their way through this fun routine. Booty Boot Camp is the only one you need weights for, and I like that she designed it to not incorporate arm exercises like her other DVDs do, because this way you can go heavy and really burn the legs out, can be done by a beginner and ramped up for advanced. Pilates is great and is real pilates, can be done by a beginner and ramped up for advanced. The cardio is high impact and will definitely get your heart racing. Because of the impact, I would say a little hard for a beginner. The menu is set up so you can pick and choose which workout or series of workouts you want to do easily.",1472774400,55,1160,4.350230414746544
7624126,5,B01BAQBM4U,"I LOVED this workout.  I will say I did not buy the actual DVD, though.  I am a member of an online subscription and did the workout there.  I loved that they add new workouts, especially since these will take a while to ship out.  The other thing that is great is you can choose each individually, or there is one you can play the entire thing through, which is what I did.  Great workout.  Def look into the online, only $10 a month and so many options!",1472688000,4,455,4.113636363636363
7624127,4,B01BAQBM4U,"The workouts are really good, this morning I did all of the workouts and according to my heart rate monitor I burned about 470 calories but keeping in mind my heart is well train from 6 years of exercise working 6 day a week,  you may be able to burn more calories than me. The workouts are challenging. The one that I found the most challenging was the cardio and the least challenging was the Pilates  which is mostly toning and my hear rate drop to about 120 beats per minute which is fine. The only thing that  really bothers me and that is why I did not gave it 5 stars is that you can not customize your own workout or have the option to play it all at once, the way that it works is you have to have the remote control near by because every 10 minutes it would automatically go back to the workouts and you have to chose your next 10 minutes.",1472083200,38,849,4.07185628742515
7624128,5,B01BAQBM4U,Tried the kickboxing and the booty bootcamp workouts so far. I like them both. I thought the booty bootcamp was hard and for it being 10 minutes I was dripping sweat. Excited to try the other workouts and glad it's only 10 minutes.,1472083200,17,231,4.395348837209302
7624129,5,B01BAQBM4U,I have maybe 10 of Jillian's DVD's love her workouts. I got this one and it's awesome I try to mix up her workouts so this makes it easier. It's broken up into 10 minute workouts. I've done the warm up and one or more of these and then done a workout from one of the other DVD's. If you have any of Jillian's other DVD's you will like this one as well.,1522627200,,352,3.835616438356164
7624130,3,B01BAQBM4U,I hate when I have to give Jillian a review less than 5 stars. But this has very awkward moves. By the time I figure out what she's doing its time to switch. Not every move of course but enough that my heart rate comes down or I don't feel any real muscle engagement.,1520553600,,267,3.962962962962963
7624131,5,B01BAQBM4U,"I got this DVD since I want to have an option to work out just for a very short time in the evening. Well, She did it again! I love this work out DVD!! I can choose which one of them I want to do and it's only 10 minutes which goes so fast yet I end up with sweat. She is just so Fun and helps me get motivated. I do HIIT type of exercise for about 30mins (T25 or Rip30 and etc..)  in the morning so this one is more like extra work out for me in the evening. I just love it so much! Thanks Jillian!",1519603200,,499,3.5779816513761467

7624134,5,B01BAQBM4U,After each workout you are sweating and feeling the pain. Great workout dvd if you don't have a lot of time!,1509062400,,108,4.190476190476191
7624135,5,B01BAQBM4U,Jillian Michaels is one of the BEST trainers out there.  She is highly motivational and genuinely sincere in her desire to help you get the results you're looking for.  I have been exercising for more than 20 years and I have 4 of her videos among others.  I always feel so powerful when I finish strong.  She explains and demonstrates proper form as well as offering modifiers to help build strength.  I love her!!!  My daughter is hooked as well.  The most intense warm-up I have ever encountered and the cardio burn at the end is killer!!!,1507680000,2,542,4.525773195876289
7624136,5,B01BAQBM4U,"I wasn't sure what to expect in 10 minutes, but it definitely kicks your butt!  Fast paced and high intensity.  I usually do 2 sessions back to back and I find that's a good workout for me in the mornings when I don't have a lot of time.",1507507200,,237,3.9166666666666665
7624137,4,B01BAQBM4U,The workouts are ok.  They just are not as intense as I would have liked.,1501027200,,73,3.8666666666666667

7624142,5,B01BAQBM4U,Great workouts and just 10 to 12 minutes that work all parts of the body,1496880000,,72,3.8666666666666667
7624143,2,B01BAQBM4U,"It is not a good workout. I thought the purpose of a 10 min break down is so that you can train specific body parts and build your own workout. This dvd is not broken down by specific body parts...there is only one butt segment...the rest of segments are like a total body workout. You cannon even set it up where they play all or go in a specific order. Pretty annoying. Also, I felt like there was never enough reps...just when i get into it, she changes to the next exercise. Dont buy, she has much better workouts than this",1496793600,,527,4.227722772277228
7624144,5,B01BAQBM4U,My wife really likes this video.  She can do however many she has time for and there's variety as well which she likes.,1496188800,,119,4.173913043478261
7624145,4,B01BAQBM4U,"It's a little more advanced than I was hoping, but at just 10 minutes it's not too hard to memorize and get into the workouts. The pilates segment is great! Jillian never fails to get that heart rate pumping and torching calories. I have to modify some moves for my knees. But all in all good workouts and learned some new moves too.",1495929600,,333,4.301587301587301
7624146,4,B01BAQBM4U,Great 10 minute workouts for when you don't have a lot of time to squeeze in a full workout,1495324800,,91,3.8421052631578947
7624147,2,B01BAQBM4U,"Not her best DVD.  I have a lot of her DVDs and this one falls flat compared to a lot of the other ones.  The workouts are intense (which you'd expect for 10 minutes), but some of them are also too rushed and it's hard to develop a good flow.  I give it 2 out of 5 stars because I liked 2 out the 5 workouts.

I do like the booty boot camp and pilates power workouts, which I'll probably throw in after other workouts.  They are both very intense and stealthily difficult (it doesn't seem like while you're working out, but you'll really feel it later).  They also seem appropriate for 10 minutes, and they flow without feeling rushed.

I did not like the three other workouts (calisthenics, kick box blast, and cardio burn).  I don't really see the point in a 10 minute cardio workout, it just felt too rushed.  I really didn't like the calisthenics workout, mostly because a large portion of it is some of my least favorite moves (anything in crab position is terrible -- I don't bend that way and I never will).  The kick box blast workout was also really rushed and all over the place.  It was nearly impossible to get into a good rhythm and I felt like she moved too quickly from exercise to exercise before you could even get into good form.  Her Kickbox FastFix DVD has three different 20 minute kick box workouts that are all way better, and I would recommend that over this DVD.

Possibly the worst part of the DVD is the warm up.  Warm ups are supposed to get you moving gently at first and by the time you're ready to start the actual work up, you won't have to worry about twisting your joints in a funny way.  This one has you bouncing and twisting all over the place right away and my nearly 40 year old joints protested.  I've never encountered this problem with any of her other workout DVDs.  I need to warm up with one of those before doing this warm up.",1493769600,10,1872,4.2727272727272725
7624148,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Very short, 15 min w/warmup and cool down, and very intense workout that will make you sweat off the calories in a small amt of time",1492819200,,132,4.115384615384615
7624149,4,B01BAQBM4U,"These are quick and respectable work outs.  I like pairing a few together for a descent workout.  The difficulty level depends on the video and your fitness level.  I completed the 30 day shred before doing these.  I found the cardio manageable but winding... Kick boxing was only hard on an ""academic"" level since I'd never done kick boxing and don't know the terminology.  Once I got it down, it was pretty easy.  Pilates was a good core work out, but not super hard.  The calisthenics and booty ones were good work outs -- not ridiculous, but not easy.  Overall - it's a nice mixer upper in my workout routine!",1491868800,4,613,4.509090909090909

7624154,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Moves aren't too hard to master if you're not a complete novice, i.e., not too complicated.  Amazing how these moves get you heart rate up so quickly.  You truly feel you've worked out hard and longer even if you only do one 10 min. section.  I do at least 2 at a time plus warm up and cool down. I have other Jillian Michaels' dvds and love most of them.  this is my new favorite.",1490054400,,381,4.04

7624160,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Love everything Jillian Michaels....I decided to buy this dvd due to I will be short on time during the week for my regular workouts that are longer than 10 minutes, so this is the perfect solution to my dilemma and its Jillian the best of both worlds",1484524800,,251,4.361702127659575
7624161,4,B01BAQBM4U,"Let me start this off by saying that I absolutely love Jillian Michaels.  She was my first DVD trainer and has always been my favorite.  I love her style of work out DVDs and I have yet to select a DVD of hers that I find to be a total dud.  I lost over one hundred pounds using her DVDs along with Bob Harper and Jackie Warner, but she was the one who really motivated me.  She helped me go from unhappy couch potato to an intermediate exerciser!

This is a good DVD, but it's definitely not my favorite of hers.  I'll explain my caveats as this review goes on.  The workout begins with a very short warm up (possibly too short, only five moves, one being a lunge which I always find makes my thighs cramp up) and a very short cool down (more may be needed).  Let me go through each of the work outs:

1. Calisthenics -- This is a very interesting workout, the likes of which I have never done before.  Some of the moves are very fun--I had a lot of fun with the rolling bear, the jumping lunges and the side kicks.  However, I found two moves completely impossible--the jump into the goddess squat and the final wheel bridge.  I always find it really discouraging, especially because I am in pretty good shape.  You would need to be a top notch, incredibly well-conditioned athlete to do every move without modification.

2. Kickboxing -- I really enjoyed this workout the first few times I did it.  I especially liked the kicks and the encouragement to imagine someone I was mad at it as I punched the air!  For me, this workout got very boring after the first five or so times I completed it.  It didn't really get my heart rate up and didn't have enough variation to keep me interested.

3. Booty Bootcamp -- This one is pretty solid, but if you want to sculpt your buns and thighs with Jillian, get Killer Buns and Thighs.  This is the baby version of that.  It really did not leave my butt burning or make me sore at all and I did it all without modification.

4. Pilates -- This is my favorite of all five workouts.  Very well-balanced pilates workout that's even more fun that the actual pilates DVDs I have.  Shannon is UNBELIEVABLE and holy cow I want her body--it was also cool to me that I recognized her from one of Mari Winsor's DVDs!  The only slight complaint I have that is barely even a complaint is that Jillian seems to not know what she's doing with pilates, constantly commenting that she is not an expert and not demonstrating really any moves.  It makes me hope that Shannon got paid extra since it seems like she was instrumental in creating this workout.  Again, not REALLY a complaint, just something I noticed.

5. Cardio -- Yeah, if you want to feel like your lungs are going to crap out and die on you, go for this workout.  Some of the moves are really fun (I love the karaokes, the high knees with the heel slap and the fast feet to rockstars--come to think of it, I like the speedbag too!) but this workout is INCREDIBLY punishing.  I found myself conveniently being ""too tired"" to do this workout when I would get to it.  I always noticed if I had been cheating on my diet, this workout became absolutely 100% impossible.  I really find it frustrating when I have to quit and stop and wait, but there were times that I was actually experiencing total muscular failure.

I would do on an average about four workouts--a few times I did five.  Four was actually pretty doable.  My biggest complaint is one that I've seen on here--there is no way to play workouts consecutively.  I didn't think this would bother me, but I found myself taking long breaks between each workouts which would then frustrate me.  Once I stop, it's hard for me to pick it up again.  It's also frustrating to warm up for two minutes and then have to grab the DVD remote and switch to the next workout when your heart is already pumping and you're ready to go!  This seems like it would be a minor problem, but it actually ended up with me losing a lot of momentum.  Maybe it would be okay if you only did one workout, but I'm sorry, just doing one of these workouts isn't going to do much for your health if that's all you do in a day.  They are intense, but ten minutes just isn't enough.

The other complaint I have is that I have never had a DVD leave me as tight as this one did.  I ended up getting a TON of very painful knots in my back (which I get a lot anyways, but never this bad).  The cool down is simply not sufficient.

This is a solid DVD, but it's not my favorite.  However, if you love Jillian and you own a lot of her DVDs, this is a fun addition.  I definitely saw results with it.  Just please make sure to add a bit of an extra cool down and have your DVD remote ready so you don't bum around between workouts.",1483660800,27,4739,4.25531914893617
7624162,5,B01BAQBM4U,"This is a perfect workout for when you only want a good 20-30 minute workout, they can be intense! I always do Cardio Burn and Booty Boot Camp together, doing every rep and using heavy weights and I about die!! Just doing two a day will whip you into shape and give you a good sweat of you will do every last rep and really not modify. I workout every day and sometimes 20 minutes is all I want to do so that's when this DVD is perfect. 10 minutes flies by and I'm already halfway through my workout if I'm doing two.

7624164,4,B01BAQBM4U,"It was nice to switch gears every 10 minutes and I liked the workouts. I also like that it is a little more cardio focused than some of her other dvds so I feel I can use it for cardio days. I didn't love having to take the time to switch to the next workout though and Jillians beginning and end of workout comments increased the time it took from workout to workout. Her commentary was less that usual so I think she was being aware of this but still. I like to do a 2-3 segment combo of the Kickboxing, Cardio, Booty Bootcamp or Calisthenics at the beginning and then I can pop off my shoes and socks quick so that I can do the Pilates and cool down segment barefoot. It's not my favorite Jillian video but I think it's a good change of pace and will be added into the mix.",1482278400,,776,4.045454545454546

7624176,1,B01BAQBM4U,"No ability to select a series of workouts which should the most standard of options.  Perhaps it was the short length, but I found the workouts boring.  Not up to the same standard as my many other Jillian workouts.",1476403200,4,215,4.487179487179487
7624177,5,B01BAQBM4U,Love the format on this dvd - great variety and can mix it up however you want.  Would love to see another one like this in her rotation!!,1476316800,,138,3.9285714285714284
7624178,4,B01BAQBM4U,"There are 5-10+ minute workouts on this DVD. I have several Jillian DVDs and alternate between a few of them. I gave this DVD 4 stars,because I have yet to buy a Jillian workout DVD that I didn't have to have my remote close by to fast forward through extra chatter where she stops the workout to give a tutorial,I think she does a SUPER job and I love her advice but i wish she would keep all the talk at the beginning and then maybe do the workout herself instead of moving around ,which would then make each side you work even with the other. I will continue to buy her DVDs because I love the way she mixes it up.",1476316800,2,617,4.065573770491803
7624179,5,B01BAQBM4U,Love the workouts,1476230400,,17,5.0
7624180,5,B01BAQBM4U,"Fun moves!  I have done all but the pilates segment.  I love the cardio segment, the kickboxing segment and the booty segment the best!  The moves have different combos than her other dvds, yet it is all very easy to pick up on the first time.  I do the kickboxing moves at my own pace, faster than her girls do on the dvd to keep my heart rate up and it is great that way!  I like being able to do the workouts in any order I choose and the warm up and cool down are fast but good.  This has to be one of my favorite dvds Jillian has put out!  Sometimes I do her segments in a row, other times I do them with her Fast Fix Kickboxing dvd, or mix it up with One Week Shred, or do  intervals with my bike and elliptical.  So many ways to mix it up!  I had to wait for it to come for a few weeks, but it was well worth the wait!",1476057600,,825,3.7167630057803467
7624181,5,B01BAQBM4U,Jillian always delivers. I started using it the same day it came in the mail. I incorporate it with my other DVDS,1475884800,,113,4.181818181818182
7624182,3,B01BAQBM4U,I usually love Jullian Micheal's DVDs but this one was not my favorite. I thought it would be nice to have a bunch of different hard workout options to choose from but I did 4 out of the 5 ( so like 45 minutes of a workout) and I was not drenched in sweat. I honestly wouldn't just workout for 10 minutes but I wanted to just do a few time thinking it would kick my butt... Nope! I would recomend this to a beginner or for when you don't feel motivated and you need a light workout. I do own almost every one of her DVDs.,1475452800,9,521,3.878504672897196

7624186,5,B01BAQBM4U,"I loved this work out.  I have every one of Jillians DVD's.  This one even after I showered, I kept sweating!  Highly recommend.",1474416000,,128,4.478260869565218
7624187,5,B01BAQBM4U,All I can say is WOW!!! I tried this dvd this morning. I was only able to try two of them as I was short on time. They really kicked my butt. I think Jillian is such an amazing trainer. On this dvd she jumps right in wasting no time. Which is great especially since it's only 10 minutes a workout. I am very glad that I purchased this dvd. I have pretty much all of Jillian's workout dvds which are all great. I was very excited to hear she was coming out with a 10 minute workout dvd because I am always short on time. It didn't disappoint at all. I can't wait to try the other workouts on the dvd. I definitely recommend this dvd to everyone. Thanks Jillian for making an amazing dvd!!,1474329600,2,687,4.0588235294117645
7624188,5,B01BAQBM4U,Some times I do not have a lot of time so I just need something quick and these workouts are fantastic!!!,1474329600,2,105,4.0476190476190474
8749737,5,B01BAQBM4U,"I love these workouts.  The warm up and cool down are separate from the other work outs.  It is nice to have an option to still work out and ""complete"" something even if I only have a few minutes to spare. The workouts are rigorous!",1535673600,,232,4.133333333333334
8749738,5,B01BAQBM4U,Short on time? These are perfect if you want to get a workout in but have a really busy schedule that day!,1535587200,,106,3.8636363636363638
8749739,5,B01BAQBM4U,I will do two or three of these to switch up other Jillian workouts and I really like it. The cardio is a killer (in a good way!).,1534896000,,130,3.6785714285714284

8749746,4,B01BAQBM4U,"Not as intense as Jillian's other videos of the same length, if you play all 5 sessions (which I think is doable if you are in pretty good shape).  Lots of different/new moves that I haven't seen in other DVDs that kept me interested.  I agree with others, there should be an option to select multiple workouts so that you don't have to keep reaching for the remote.",1522627200,,366,4.367647058823529
