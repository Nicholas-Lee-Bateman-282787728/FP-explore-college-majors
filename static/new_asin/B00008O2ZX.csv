7985982,5,B00008O2ZX,"I've seen this short-film collection before when it was originally released through SRS Cinema, so I was curious to see what was different on this new special edition that was put out by Elite Entertainment.

There's some nice, brand-new bonus features included on this DVD (including trailers of upcoming Wicked Pixel Cinema flicks like DEADWOOD PARK, which looks simply amazing, and the ""Gallery of Abstraction"" - a groovy collection of micro-short subjects that were very chaotic and visually expressionistic) and there's some noticable picture improvement on some of the featured short films when compared to the original DVD release (partically on CURVEBALL: PILE OF JUNK).

Speaking of expressionistic, the DVD kicks off with a hauntingly beautiful black and white sequence of a naked woman walking down a starkly-lit stairwell that reminded me of early David Lynch films (think Eraserhead).  It was visually quite accomplished, but I must admit that I was a tad bit confused when this sequence continued to loop itself over and over again with no indications on how to access the shorts films or the bonus features, but with a little maneuvering with my remote control (I just hit the down arrow on my remote), the menu options suddenly appeared.  I must say that this was both a clever and original idea for a DVD menu.  Very cool!

If you've seen this collection of short films before, this new DVD is definitely worth the upgrade.  If you haven't, and if you're looking for a collection of short films by some talented up-and-coming filmmakers, I whole-heartedly recommend this DVD.",1189036800,4,1592,5.076628352490421
7985983,5,B00008O2ZX,"This is a wide range of short stories gathered together by Eric Stanze (SAVAGE HARVEST, ICE FROM THE SUN, SCRAPBOOK).  Fans of gore, comedy, and experimental shorts alike will definitely enjoy this collection.  I enjoyed them all from Emmy award winning music video, ""Curveball - Pile of Junk,"" directed by Jason Christ (ICE FROM THE SUN, SAVAGE HARVEST 2: OCTOBER BLOOD) to Aaron Crozier's musical comedy short, ""Liontown.""  This disk has something for everyone to enjoy.  Recommend highly to any fan of independent film!",1123459200,6,522,5.178571428571429
7985984,5,B00008O2ZX,"One of the best independent short film compilation DVD's ever made in my eyes.  From hilarious comedy shorts to horrifying intense shorts this is the most bang for my buck I have.  Two of the best pieces in my eyes are LIONTOWN, written and directed by Aaron Crozier (Director and writer of GRUMBOON), and starring Matt Sinnople (Actor in the up and coming DEADWOOD PARK and THE MATT SINNOPLE SHOW), and VICTIM, written and directed by Jason Christ (Director and writer for the up and coming SAVAGE HARVEST II and actor in DEADWOOD PARK).",1121558400,7,538,4.712765957446808
