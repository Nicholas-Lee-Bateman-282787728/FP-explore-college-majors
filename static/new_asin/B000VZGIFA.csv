8220677,2,B000VZGIFA,"So I purchased this video thinking it would be modern and fun (look at the cover) and was quite surprised when I turned on the DVD... talk about 1980s! The people used ""canned"" goods as weights and I don't even want to get into what they were wearing!",1231459200,5,251,4.25
8220678,1,B000VZGIFA,"Don't waste your money! Not only was this video shot in the 1980's in Australia, but it's not even a motivating workout. It's all over the place, I was highly disappointed.",1204243200,12,172,4.580645161290323
8220679,1,B000VZGIFA,"The cover looks modern... BUT IT IS NOT.  I guess it was my fault for not doing research and being lured in by the low price, but come on!!  It was like a bad Australian infomercial from the 80's skip this one and get Amy Bento or the Firm.",1203033600,11,240,3.877551020408163
