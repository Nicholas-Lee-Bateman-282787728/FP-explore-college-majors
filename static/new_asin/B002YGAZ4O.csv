8384214,4,B002YGAZ4O,"Just a brief comment on THE STRATTON STORY (1948), about a brave Major League pitcher who returned to the game after he lost a leg in a hunting accident...

The film doesn't work for me because Jimmy Stewart isn't convincing as a ballplayer and at age 41 he can't pass for a finely conditioned athlete in his mid-20s.

All fans of 1930s Warner gangster pictures should see director Mervyn LeRoy's (and Warner's) widescreen Technicolor, 149 minute production of THE FBI STORY (1959). Because much of the story takes place in the 1920s and '30s, we see the familiar old cars, clothing styles and weaponry used in those exciting motion pictures.

James Stewart and Vera Miles star. Murray Hamilton is Jimmy's first FBI partner. They see all the major crime events of that 20 year span and are in on the capture or killing of such outlaws as John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson. These sequences are right out of WB's best gangster films.

Also with Nick Adams, as a man who sends his mom aboard an airliner with a timebomb, so that when she and 48 others perish, he can collect on a flight insurance policy.

Uncrediteds include J. Edgar Hoover, Chief Yowlachie, Luana Anders, Ann Doran, Stacy Keach Sr. (as Machine Gun Kelly), Roy Thinnes  and the voice of Adam West.

This one in look and feel has Warner's written all over it and I think it's a classic!
