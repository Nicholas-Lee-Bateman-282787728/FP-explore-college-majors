5389518,5,B00A6WW15Y,It's great to know that through God all things are possible. Sometimes it's hard to understand and we make choices that really hurt us but God is the answer. This film is a great illustration on how God guides us back to Him with open arms.,1382745600,3,240,4.239130434782608
5389519,5,B00A6WW15Y,"I was browsing around amazon prime and needed something to watch and found this. It hit right to the heart of do I really believe God is moving in everything or do I attribute anything or everything to coincidence. Not sure how Amazon chooses their movies to make available on Prime, but I hope they put more movies like this up for viewing. Well worth it even if it wasn't free.",1381622400,13,379,4.352112676056338
5389520,5,B00A6WW15Y,I really liked the message! and think it is a great film for teenagers to watch.. I will suggest it to my friends.,1362787200,3,114,4.0
5389521,2,B00A6WW15Y,"i watched ""listen"" be the same writer-director-editor-etc guy F.C Rabbath and i rather enjoyed that one. It was because of that other film that i watched this one. Though the premise of this movie was a good one, the execution was lacking. I don't would not recommend it.",1405123200,,271,4.666666666666667
5389522,1,B00A6WW15Y,"I didn't even finish it. As a believer, I was disappointed that this didn't do a better job of facilitating the conversation between believers and non-believers. I found the characterizations to be trite and over-simplified.",1397433600,3,224,5.428571428571429
5389523,1,B00A6WW15Y,Did not know it was going to be the type of movie that I could find on the worship channel.  Actors seemed Luke student actors.  Poor campaign movie promoting God.,1393804800,,163,4.4
5389524,1,B00A6WW15Y,"I had hopes this would actually be thought provoking. The film provoked thought alright, thoughts of, ""This is terribly acted, terribly shot and there's a thin plot."" Yuk. This movie was made to proselytize and to annoy people like me.",1393545600,5,235,4.9
5389525,2,B00A6WW15Y,This was not what I was hoping for - very slow- weird story line and hard to get caught up in. To religious :-P,1392163200,,111,3.6666666666666665
5389526,1,B00A6WW15Y,"This is a perfectly awful movie.  It got everything wrong.  Lousy script -- oh, so unbelievably bad.  Terrible acting.  If they gave awards for bad acting, this movie would take them all.  Awful production values.  Bad story line.

What's sad is that the person who wrote and produced this thought it was worth spending $$$, time and effort on.  It's pablum served up as if it's gold.  Somewhere there are Christians who have some intelligent underpinnings to their belief, but you won't find it here.",1390867200,7,501,4.8
5389527,1,B00A6WW15Y,I thought this movie was going to be more intellectually grasping. The description of the movie itself should include the fact that it to preach the message of Christianity in a discrete way.,1388707200,3,191,4.818181818181818
5389528,1,B00A6WW15Y,The message was not clear and the acting was horrible. This movie did not do justice to the intellectual and spiritual depth of the Gospel -- so disappointing.,1388534400,,159,4.714285714285714
5389529,1,B00A6WW15Y,"About a man who ""loses his 'faith' in atheism"". Oh, so laughable. Even the film's blurb tells you the the makers have little of no understanding of the subject they are talking about, and that this clearly is not an unbiased and reasoned film about the subject. Atheism is not a belief. It is the opposite of belief. Atheism has nothing to do with faith in the religious sense. Most of us don't believe that trees are the most intelligent life form on this planet, but if someone changes their mind and starts to believe that maybe trees are the most intellgent life form, then have they ""lost their faith"" in not believing that trees are the most intelligent. And the film looks like it was made by a bunch of junior high school kids. Not only is this film poorly made in every respect but it also reveals a very immature and spectacularly narrow worldview on the part of the film makers. Plenty of religious people become atheists every year, hell even every week. But you don't see genuine atheists suddenly becoming 'believers' anymore than you see grown, sane people suddenly developing a devout belief in leprechauns and unicorns.",1387929600,8,1136,4.685
5389530,5,B00A6WW15Y,"It's nice to browse through a bunch a films and find one that truly captivates you.  I enjoy films that really pull me into what they are showing, and makes me really think about the message they are giving the audience.  The film is shot beautifully, the script is amazingly written, and the acting is superb.  Overall it is a wonderful movie that, in my honest opinion, is better than most million dollar Hollywood films.
Check out this film, you'll be glad you did!
And if the director of this amazing movie reads this, keep up the amazing work, because it truly inspires people. I look forward to your future films!",1387756800,5,619,4.558558558558558
5389541,1,B00A6WW15Y,"My wife & I are Evangelical Christians, so we could sympathize with the intended message of the movie. But the characters were given a sad, shallow script. The atheist-turned-believer repeated the same clichs over & again for his atheism as well as his newly found faith in God, making a thin case for both. The evangelist in the park was smug and aloof, and the father who was a believer was missing simple relationship skills with his son. When the movie actually started to come alive a few times, it quickly diverged back into a weird, sad script of weird actor responses.
To be fair, some of the young actors in this movie have a lot more potential than the script gave them any capacity to demonstrate. But Rachel's roommate was the only character that stood out as genuine and as saying things that one would reasonably expect someone to say in those circumstances.",1387756800,4,872,4.6688311688311686
5389542,5,B00A6WW15Y,"This film ignores the rest of the Christian film industry and really takes a deeper look at one's faith. Instead of shoving dogma down your throat, Rabbath challenges you to think about spirituality and look critically at the idea of God. I would recommend this to anyone.",1387411200,4,272,4.808510638297872
5389543,1,B00A6WW15Y,"This is a shallow awful movie. It has no body, substance, depth or conviction. The actors are terrible. The movie line is kitch, cheezy, hackney, nauseating in the sickest, most idol worshipping way. Its unspiritual and gets the worst arguments for faith in divinity. Its boring, slow and badly filmed",1386806400,2,301,5.04
5389544,5,B00A6WW15Y,"I've ben following F.C Rabbath on youtube for quite some time and I was very excited to see this movie. I love his short films, and his features never fail to amaze. Deep, thought provoking, and beautiful. Check it out if you haven't seen it. Looking forward to see what he comes up with next!",1386720000,2,293,4.345454545454546
5389545,1,B00A6WW15Y,"If I could give it -5 stars, I would. It's clearly an anti-atheist, anti-logic movie with a fundamentalist agenda. I've seen high school productions portray better acting. This move is a scam with a capital S",1386460800,6,208,4.805555555555555
5389546,2,B00A6WW15Y,"It was like watching a long commercial for a church.  It did not leave us questioning anything.  Cheesy, terrible storylines",1385942400,2,124,5.15
5389547,1,B00A6WW15Y,"How did this movie get 3 1/2 stars?  I was looking forward to a thought-provoking film about an atheist who changes his mind and why. There is no why in this film.  Bad script, bad acting, amateur production.  Don't waste your time.",1385769600,5,232,4.476190476190476
5389548,3,B00A6WW15Y,"It was slow and poorly acted.  I tried to watch, but got bored.  Message seemed good, but I just could not get through it.",1385424000,,122,4.041666666666667
5389549,4,B00A6WW15Y,I like it.  The fact that folks will harshly respond to someone who 'changes' their life to live for God is a garantee.  The point that many folks will be placed in a position to choose their faith or a particular person/relationship is also realistic. Often the choice made  will make clear what degree of faith one actually has.  I am pretty certain that many folks grapple over wether or not they 'believe' or are willing to step out and trust God in their lives.  I'm also certain that God will send someone into each of our paths and use that person to speak to us.  We have to be willing to listen.,1385251200,,604,4.300884955752212
5389550,2,B00A6WW15Y,"This is truly a terrible movie.  The acting is painful to watch--the performances are self-conscious and manage to be both wooden and melodramatic.  All of the characters are self-absorbed and unlikable.  The park custodian is so smug and creepy that I'm convinced the actor mixed up scripts.  Apparently, instead of playing ""all-knowing sage"" in this movie (a role that would be given to Morgan Freeman if this were a Hollywood flick), he's playing a ""flasher/pedophile stalking the park"" from a Law and Order:  SVU episode.  The redhead's character is such a cranky-looking harpy that it's hard to care what happens to her.  The actress who is the harpy's friend/roommate was told she was playing the role of ""sassy black friend,"" and she is clearly giving this stereotype all she's got.  The atheist writer, just looks constipated.

If you want to watch a movie about seemingly unrelated events that tie in together and, ultimately, reveal the presence of a higher power which leads to a nonbeliever becoming a believer--and this movie tries miserably to be that movie--you're better off watching Shyamalan's Signs.",1384819200,,1118,5.132596685082873
5389551,1,B00A6WW15Y,"How could anyone possibly say this is a good movie!? It's poorly acted, terribly directed with no character development and home-movie grade audio. I never write movie reviews, and FYI, I believe in God, but a bad movie is a bad movie people! I wrote a review because I saw so many stupid positive reviews that made me waste my time watching this terrible movie. It strikes me as quite COINCIDENTAL that the first time I've ever been bamboozled about a movie review is one that's completely religious for the sake of being religious. The people who reviewed this movie were most definitely beyond a shadow of a doubt biased, or otherwise blind deaf and dumb. I didn't enjoy this movie, not because it's about God, but because it's a terrible movie! Do not watch this movie if you are religious and enjoy movies in general, only watch this movie if you are both religious and could care less about cinematography, story, or acting.",1384646400,8,930,4.676829268292683
5389552,2,B00A6WW15Y,"Not good. Boring, mostly because of the bad acting. I am going to give it two stars because it was not someones home video (so there was some production put into it), and although it was slow and boring, if you have not put much thought into these types of questions - then it puts some basics out there. Basic, boring moving.",1384473600,,326,4.274193548387097
5389553,3,B00A6WW15Y,"I had high hopes for this movie after reading the positive reviews on this site and other sites selling this movie. I ordered it planning to watch it with our Church youth group. However, after viewing the movie I will have to keep searching. I am a strong Catholic, whole heartedly believe in God and ""God instances"" rather than ""coincidence."" I just want to be honest and be able to say when something isn't that great. Even though it has a Christian lable and theme, doesn't mean it's automatically good. It's not a bad drama I'd just say it's neutral. It's not that compelling.

Overall this movie has potential, but if you watch it with a group of kids you will have to have a group prepared to do a lot of discussion. I could see it being used as a prompt but it does not flesh out the deeper content one is seeking. It's not a movie you can just watch and ""get it."" You're not going to know exactly how to react or what you learned from it just from viewing it. It requires more digging and discussion on things not thoroughly covered in the movie, to glean out a message and lesson out of it. Personally I think a movie is good when you don't have to dig and stretch to glean a message or lesson out, somehow the writer and director are able to guide you step by step to learn the lesson and get the message. Movies such as ""Courageous,"" ""The Blind Side,"" or ""The Lion the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" are excellent movies that do that.

It had a lot of themes and issues; distractions, reaching out, repentance, leading others a stray, evangelization (doing it wrong), evangelization (doing it right) anger, depression, friendship, priorities, death, loss, pride and guilt. I think the problem is that you just can't sufficiently flesh out a beginning, middle, and conclusion for all these themes in a 74min. movie! Some things weren't built up, some were left with loose ends, some were chopped up, some escalated at an inauthentic rate, lots left me with the questions ""so then what? or why was that scene important how did it contribute?"" and really there were too many things going on for a person to be able to pull together in the end. I know my high school kids won't be able to stay attentive with all this going on.

When Gavin does confess he believes in God, all at once everyone boos, cries and throws things at him. Would this really be the reaction of an audience expecting a talk on God not existing only to find out that their speaker suddenly has faith? I doubt this reaction. I think they would be questioning him, maybe get up and leave, but not lashing out like animals the way they did at the auditorium.

There were other things.... Overall the issue was so many themes and not a lot of tieing it all up or cause and effect and conclusion. I think it would have helped to be more stream lined, built up the relationships and built a relationship between the audience and the story. It was kind of like we were dropped into a scene and we saw what happened to the characters within a period of days or weeks? not sure... but we never really learned who they were. I think we all do this though, we have so much we want to share and touch on, we want to cover it all but really it's not about ""quantity"" you could have one or two things to focus on and make it ""quality"" and more fruitful for the one receiving the message.

Now one could say I'm ""too focused on the negatives"" and that made me miss the positive...well maybe thats a problem too, with all the themes and stuff going on, it's easy to get distracted from whats really going on.",1384300800,7,3568,4.38368580060423
5389554,4,B00A6WW15Y,"Although there are moments that simply antagonize viewers, this film is seemingly a potential overview of modern society.  Technology holds our interest while God, or a higher power, and other humans slip through our fingers.  It is not shocking to learn that a non-believer changes their view, what is surprising is that it is genuine.  There are numerous instances of chance meetings, but the intensity of the experience is much more and that unfolds seamlessly throughout the action.  This film is well worth a viewer's time.",1383955200,,528,5.104651162790698
5389555,4,B00A6WW15Y,"(by John's wife, Julie)
While the acting leaves so much to be desired, the (predictable) film still leaves believers in an uplifted mood and, for that reason, I'm giving this film 4 stars.

It's a shame there aren't many religiously-themed films made with actors whose performances might actually be enjoyed by non-believers.  Film is an easy way to get non-believers to at least take some time to watch and listen and, hopefully, then start thinking about God's existence.  (With some non-believers, it absolutely will take baby steps!)",1383955200,,537,5.149425287356322

5389557,4,B00A6WW15Y,"A good movie to move people to consider their spirituality as well as Christianity. Suffering is not of God but He can use it to help us consider ourselves & Him as Creator. Science also points to God's existence because the very constants of physics, gravity, electromagnetic forces, etc., cannot evolve but must work in immediate conjunction. Thanks to Prime for sharing this film.",1383609600,,383,5.0

5389559,3,B00A6WW15Y,There was some really really bad acting in the movie.  painful to watch certain parts it took away from the content of the movie,1382918400,6,128,4.333333333333333

8547253,5,B00A6WW15Y,"I thought the acting was fine and that some of the actors to me seem like they are just as good as the ""A-listers"" in Hollywood, so I didn't quite get some of the negative comments I read about the acting on here. Anyway,  this movie reminded me of how easily life experiences can sway us from believing in something we can't feel, see, or touch.  So I am thankful for being reminded that events can and do have meaning and that their is a purpose for each and everyone of us if we are willing to listen and look for it.  Nothing happens by coincidence and although there could have been some more explaining as to the God doesn't make bad things happen I think most of us get what the author is trying to say that with faith things that happen that are bad made right for a good reason. There is no blueprint for life so sometimes we do need to get broken down to get re-built up... true.  Very touching story, entertaining and a nice twist at the end.  Excellent !!",1448582400,,967,4.205405405405405

8547257,1,B00A6WW15Y,"Unapologetically bad.

Bad script and bad acting. Offers a poorly contrived film, both philosophically AND religiously!  The film does not succeed in making either side of the religious discussion look sympathetic or appealing since it offers us only one dimensional, thin-as-cardboard characters.  The script reveals its own intellectual limitations as well as its own lack of affinity even while attempting to  establish emotionally viable characters.  Nothing is achieved apart from the polemical, stupid, and stereotyped ideas the characters adhere to.

This film is a good invitation to move from skepticism toward a brutal and thorough-going misanthropy for human idiocy.",1419120000,,677,5.787878787878788
