1783514,5,B00006L74J,"I teach in a very racially diverse district in a city.  My kids have seen The Firebird and Petrushka.  I labeled the Moor character as the Moor-clown puppet.  They didn't have any problem with that at all.  In fact, in the opening sequence of Petrushka some of my little girls were saying ""I'm her""  ""No, I call her"".  They were dancing vicariously through the TV.  Some of them actually got up and tried some turns and spins in the dancing space of the music classroom.

My 6th Graders studied the Firebird in depth.  They loved the effects and costumes.

Scheherezade is actually the story of the Prince who eventually married Scheherezade.  The story is great, but the Princess' lover is like the extreemly efeminate Cuban character from Sex in the City.  Once you get past that in a sparkled turban it's good.  Very erotic costumes.  I'm not showing it below 7th Grade.

Cheers",1149206400,10,881,4.666666666666667
1783515,5,B00006L74J,"My husband and i both rate this 5 stars.  He's a music expert; he says the orchestra played difficult music perfectly.  He says it's our best ballet -- rich period costumes,lush color, wide variety of characters, exciting pacing, special effects, great for kids,too.  I know Russian folktales illustrated by Bilibin, and the Firebird well captures the spirit of Bilibin's fabulous illustrations. We loved the crowd scenes in Petrushka.  Scheherazadeh is a non-traditional, altered story-line, but well done, exotic.",1135641600,11,515,5.564102564102564
1783516,5,B00006L74J,"In October 2004 I was in Riga, Latvia and saw the live performance of these three ballets by the ""Russian Ballet"" company. Very impressive performance. I bought the DVD when I returned to the United States and comparing it to the live performance I can say that this DVD is a rare treat. I highly recommend it.",1100131200,38,310,4.456140350877193
1783517,5,B00006L74J,"The disk is entitled, ""Return of the Firebird.""  What is presented is three complete ballets: The Firebird, Petrushka, and Schehrazade.  (There is no piece of music here entitled ""Return of the Firebird."")  The picture quality is sharp and crystal clear.  The color balance is excellent. The cinematography includes close-ups, distant shots, and varying angles.  The costumes are lavish, appropriate, and of extensive variety.  The scenes for all three ballets take place on a stage, but the snowy scenes feature ""real"" artificial snowflakes falling upon the dancers.  The Shrovetide scene include props that are appropriate to a town square market, e.g., samovars and live horses.  The interlude with the Moor, ballerina, and puppet takes place on a tropical seashore where the set includes palm trees and a real (not scary) snake.  The puppet's gestures are distantly reminiscent of Peewee Herman's body language.  Petrushka is the standout piece of the three productions.  Firebird does not follow the same storyline that I have read in three different translations, see, e.g., Jeremiah Curtin's Myths and Folk-Tales of the Russians, Western Slavs, and Magyars, published by Dover; or Favorite Russian Fairy Tales, by Arthur Ransome, also published by Dover.  But do not worry, the DVD comes with a beautiful, full color booklet (in English) containing a 3-paragraph synopsis of each storyline.  Much of Firebird takes place in a dark cave, containing demons and spiderwebs.  Hence, the production of Firebird is less attractive than the largely out-of-door scenes found in Petrushka.  The production of the disk being reviewed is in welcome contrast to The Royal Danish Ballet version of Firebird (on Kulture), which is blurry and contains a stable camera.  Note also that The Kirov Ballet's production of The Sleeping Beauty on the Kulture label is also unspeakably blurry, contains off-colors, and a bothersome stable camera angle.  Again, the disk under review gets five stars because of the crystal-clear visual quality, the varying camera angles, and splendid costumes.  Note also, of course, that Firebird and Petrushka are two of most monumental pieces of music to be created by mankind.  (Also note that the music of the three ballets are abundantly accessible to children, while in contrast, to give some examples, the saxophone compositions of John Coltrane, piano of Cecil Taylor, and string quartets by Bartok, would not be attractive to little kids.)",1072483200,84,2467,5.344559585492228
1783518,3,B00006L74J,"I had this DVD imported from England in order to be able to see ""Firebird"" and ""Scheherazade"", for both ballets were unkown to me at the time. Shortly afterwards, I was able to obtain the ""Firebird"" from the Royal Ballet, and I was amazed at its superlative qualities. What makes this Russian version inferior is the dated concept of sets and cinematography. The camera frequently performs travellings that disturb our view of the dancing. The sets remind me of Vincent Price horror films of the 40's; the stage is cluttered with useless props (spiders, bats and the like...) and the costumes are rather heavily embroidered. I guess this reflects the Russian taste for rich materials, but one has to compare it to London's staging - which is truer to the original concept - to realize that rich fabrics don't necessarily make rich costumes. Ilse Liepa's make up is so heavy as to be embarassing (she plays the title role). Mr Andris Liepa - who directed the films - does not have much do do... there are no solos or variations for him, but his partnering is elegant without being too refined.
As for ""Petrushka"", there are two other stagings available, and I believe they are both far superior to this one. In Mr. Liepa's chcracterization, Petrushka is a pathetic creature, with no sense of human dignity. After all, this puppet is supposed to have a human soul... The version staged by the Joffrey Ballet with Rudolf Nureyev, and the version of the Paris Opera are to be preferred.
Which leaves us with ""Scheherazade"". As there are no other versions to compare, I must admit that I liked this one. Ms Ilse Liepa is stunningly beautiful! The role was originally created in 1910 by a rather poor dancer - Ida Rubinstein - who was better known for her beauty than her dancing, so Mr. Fokine coreographed her part with restraint. The great surprize is the dancing of Mr. Victor Yeremenko, a former dancer at the Sevchenko Ballet in the Ukraine. He dances the role of the Golden Slave, created by the mythic Nijinsky. And what a formidable dancer he is! Of course, there are no recorded documents of Nijinsky's performance, but I believe Mr. Yeremenko does an amirable job. His dancing shows him to be able to diplay both lusty eroticism in the pas de deux and a frantic desperation at the final sequence, when the slaves are murdered. The role of the fat eunuch is poorly danced. The performer is obviously slim with a lot of padding in his costume to make him look fat. Also, instead of being mischivious, he's merely comical, which detracts fom the psychology of the character. The corps de ballet is fine, with the male dancers performing vigorously, in marked contrast to the girl's langorous movements.
The coreography seems to have been tampered with. Cyril Beaumont - who was able to see the original productions of the Diaghilev company - claims that the third movement of the score was not used, but here the full score is danced. Who may have coreographed the extra numbers? Was it Isabelle Fokine, who went to Russia in the 90's to restore her grandfather's coreographies?
In ""Scheherazade"", the stunning original sets by Lon Bakst have been done in three-dimensions in order to admit coreography in the round. I don't think this was a good idea, as in the original there was an illusion of three-dimensionality, whereas in the film the camera travells liberaly through the stage, often with close-ups. Although less cluttered than in ""Firebird"", I still find some of the props obtrusive.",1070409600,25,3496,4.789735099337748

1783520,4,B00006L74J,"Featuring some of the stars of Russia's famed Bolshoi ballet company, RETURN OF THE FIREBIRD is an artistic treat for both the ear and the eye.  Directed by and starring famed dancer Andris Leipa, this movie features 3 stories: Stravinsky's PETRUSHKA and THE FIREBIRD, along with Rimsky-Korsakov's SCHEHERAZADE.  The opening PETRUSHKA segment, with its balance of puppet-drama amidst the goings-on at a country fair, is probably the least enjoyable as the more interesting story of the romantic triangle of the clown puppet, Petrushka, his sweetheart, and a villainous Moor tends to take a back seat to the more general action.  It's a shame as Leipa is wonderful as the title character.  With arms akimbo and a hang-dog expression, he engages our sympathy.  THE FIREBIRD is more of a fantastic piece with its emphasis on flashy visuals and special light effects.  The wonderfully bright and spooky costumes compliment the solid performances of the entire cast. This section perfectly captures the spirit of the old Russian fairy tale. The final segment, SCHEHERAZADE, is more of a prologue to the classic Arabian Nights tale, as it tells the story of a powerful Sultan and the wife who cheats on him. When he finds out, he massacres the servants who abetted the affair, while his wife commits suicide.  Leipa, is not at his best in his small role as the Sultan. In fact, he seems almost stuck in a mopey mode during the brief time he's onscreen.  Fortunately, sister Iilze Leipa turns in a stunning performance as the faithless wife.  From her opening appearance lounging in her tent to her dying moments at the end, Ms. Leipa exudes a raw-edged sexuality that is mesmerizing to watch, which makes this section a wonderful final act to this solid film.  Overall, this is a top-notch film that will delight ballet fans everywhere which, despite its minor flaws, is certainly worth recommending.",1066003200,30,1894,4.984126984126984
1783522,5,B00006L74J,"The three presentations on this disk--Firebird, Petrushka, Scheherazade--are all mesmerizing in their lush productions and cinematic style, thoroughly something Diaghilev would have approved of. It's a wonderful disk to have, wonderful productions to provoke thought and compare with more traditional presentations of ballet.  And that right there is the interesting point:  To view these is not to have the ""ballet experience.""  To view these is to appreciate the thought, research, and expenditure put into what you are seeing, even to be enthusiastic about them; but for most of the time it does not serve Fokine's choreographical conceptualization well.  Rarely do you see the expanse of the stage all at once, rarely do you follow an individual, or even a separate group, for long.  Sometimes the rich expansion of the sets interferes with the choreography:  I'm thinking of the sequence in ""Petrushka"" when P. is--traditionally--beating on the walls of his enclosure, an iconic sequence; here, he is seemingly in a vast void, and can only flail his arms, because there is nothing to beat against.  Something to complain about, or something only to note as ""different""?  You be the judge.  Overall, you experience here a series of moments--beautiful moments--you drink in the wonderfully-played music--but, due to the nature of the direction and camera work, you do not feel the dynamics and rhythm of the choreography.  It's wonderful--buy it--enjoy it!  But also purchase a DVD of a more traditional presentation for comparison, and see which you like better as ballet...",1474243200,,1578,5.32258064516129

Someone in making this decided that unusual camera angles was more important than the integrity of these ballets. In fact I don't know why they even bothered to use ballet dancers, as you rarely get to see anyone dance. In the Firebird you feel like you are trying to catch a glimpse of dancing while peeking through some kind of trellis. This is really not a DVD I will be keeping in my collection, it is just to choppy and Cinematic to capture any of the true essence of these ballets.",1385424000,5,600,4.414414414414415
1783540,5,B00006L74J,"This set comprises a made-for-Russian-television group of ballet productions. It was made by Moslilm studios and directed by Mariinsky star Andris Liepa. It is not a live stage production and it would be a mistake to judge it in that way. It does, however, have considerable merit and is a viable alternative or addition to standard staged productions.

The dancers are uniformly excellent with many drawn from the Bolshoi Ballet company and this production is a deliberate attempt to recreate the original Ballet Russes productions of these three works from the beginning of the 20th century. The choreography is based on that by Michael Fokine but seen through the film medium. To my mind this concept is remarkably convincing and an involving alternative to a stage productions.

The Petrushka production gains enormously from the apparent open air setting and the tremendous array of national costumes seen in great detail. A great sense of the festive occasion is achieved. The setting and visuals allow one to feel involved in a real occasion - quite special.

The Firebird makes use of effects not available to a stage production. These are used to enhance the arrival and departure of the glowing Firebird and her donated feather and also add to the magical and dark underworld of the evil sorcerer etc!

The Scheherazade ballet has nothing to do with the Rimsky Korsakov suite other than the music which is used to accompany a story of sexual deception and revenge. All very Oriental with lots of deep meaning looks! Entertaining in its own right though and the dancing is completely entertaining and of the same high standard as the rest of the program.

All the ballets are presented in good surround sound (DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1) or stereo but with some typically artificially close balances for those used to Russian recordings of the period (1992). The visual presentation is high quality colour and sharpness in 4:3 ratio (pre widescreen but not requiring further allowance).

Altogether I have found this to be a very enjoyable set to be considered either as an excellent single version of each ballet or as an addition to a live stage performance. Only the Firebird is currently available as a stage production and this is a different experience. There are no current alternatives of the Petrushka or Scheherazade ballets so the attractions of this disc are thus further enhanced.

I personally have enjoyed this presentation very much and, judged on its own film terms, find this to be well worth the full 5 stars. It should give much pleasure to all except those who resist any alternative to genuine staged productions and insist on that type of veracity.",1343520000,7,2672,4.950892857142857

1783542,3,B00006L74J,The main problem I have with this dvd is that I don't get a sense of an actual stage performance. This comes off as a Hollywood movie set. The camera moves all over the stage to get unusual shots that are often too close. I don't need to get an ultra closeup shot of the huge fake eyelashes on Nina Ananiashvili. The camera work is perhaps worst of all in Scheherazad. This camera person apparently felt the need to enhance the effect of these classic works for the viewer.  The costumes are very fine. The dancing seems fine (what can be seen of it). The sets are three dimensional so I wonder how authentic they are. The orchestra  sounds surprisingly good compared to most ballet orchestras. Recorded sound and picture are excellent. This could have been so much better if not sabotaged by the camera work.,1332806400,4,809,4.534246575342466

The picture is also superb with brilliant color, and the staging, sets, costumes, etc are dazzeling - even compared to 35 years of the magnificant sets and productions from Seattle Opera -  but the soul here is always the music - and the DTS soundtrack is awesome !!!!

1783546,2,B00006L74J,"I will try to make this comparatively brief. There is only one Nina Ananiashvili. She is absolutely marvelous. However, even she was not enough to save this recording of ""The Firebird."" The dancing by all was acceptable, but the camerawork was an abomination. Half the time we were looking at close-ups of dancers' faces and shots of them from the waist up. The subjects were all smiling, as if for a family portrait. In addition, much of the action at the beginning of the ballet was seen through a fence. I was interested in neither the fence nor the face of Ivan who was looking through the holes in the fence. The dancing was almost completely hidden.
  This was advertised as using the original choreography by Mikhail (or Michel) Fokine. I recently purchased a DVD of ""The Firebird"" and ""Le Sacre du Printemps"" by the Mariinsky Ballet. They, too, use the original choreography (as reconstructed) for the two ballets. Although most of the choreography for the two DVDs was comparable, there were some differences. However, since the reconstruction of the original choreography from around 1910 was a difficult task, I can forgive such differences. However, I cannot forgive the monstrous camerawork, the horses and other distractions that were going on at the beginning of the ballet and between scenes, and all of the technological flames and other highlights for the feather and the Firebird, herself. This was, in my opinion, a ""pop"" version of the ballet which might be acceptable to those who know nothing about ballet. However, those who love ballet, and this ballet in particular, will find it unforgiveable.
  Buy the Mariinsky DVD and enjoy a truly marvelous version of ""The Firebird."" You will also see a rarity: a reconstruction of ""Le Sacre du Printemps"" as it was performed in 1913, causing a riot by the audience and dancers. The French had a lot of fun in those days (its premiere was in France). This is NOT classical ballet, but it is fantastic as a historical document.",1279584000,12,1992,4.867256637168142

1783550,5,B00006L74J,"I bought this DVD because it states that it is a reconstruction of the original ballets based on the original choreography by Fokine and sets and costumes designed by Leon Baskst for the original productions by the Ballet Russes at the beginning of the 20th century.
  Although there is a little cinnemagraphic special effects added, they are few and judiciously used to enhance the overall effect. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and as colorful as a Faberge Egg.  The music is equally rich and exotic. There are interesting and varied camera shots unlike sitting in an audience viewing a stage from the same angle the entire time.
  I was a little dissapointed that the storyline of Scheherazade did not follow Rimsky-Korsakov's original, however, that would not be practical to exicute on stage with all the original different scenes.  Since, of the three works, it was not originally intended as a ballet, some compromises are to be expected.
  The best recommendation I can make is to report that in addition to the original copy I bought, I have subsequently given out 2 more as gifts: one to a professional musician who has played all of these works many times, and the other to non-musicians, who probably have never heard all three works.  I feel this is an excellent way to introduce someone who is not familiar with classical music to these masterpieces, by having them in so accessible and enjoyable presentations.  It is also a excellent gift for anyone who already knows these scores, as I did.  I strongly recommend this production which appears to have been produced with the intention to be the most difinitive performances as well as the most lavish, with no expense spared.",1207958400,11,1699,4.885017421602788
1783551,4,B00006L74J,"In 1909 Serge Diaghilev founded the Ballets Russes in Paris as a venue for Modernist ballet.  This DVD presents reconstructions of three of his earliest productions: ""Petrushka"" and ""The Firebird,"" both commissioned from Igor Stravinsky, and an adaptation of Rimsky-Korsakov's 1888 symphonic suite ""Scheherazade,"" all dating from 1910-11.  These three works were choreographed by Michel Fokine.  The original sets and costumes for ""Petrushka"" were designed by Alexander Benois, for ""The Firebird"" by Alexander Golovin and Leon Bakst, and for ""Scheherazade"" by Bakst.

Here the ""Russian Seasons"" (""Les Saisons Russes"") Dance Ensemble, led by Andris Liepa, use Fokine's original choreography, with the assistance of Isabelle Fokina as a consultant; the sets and costumes for each ballet are ""revived on the basis of the original sketches"" by Benois, Bakst and Golovin.  Thus this DVD gives us important insight into Diaghilev's artistic vision of a century ago, a time when radical Modernism was breaking loose from 19th Century convention in music and the visual and performing arts.  (The title ""Return of the Firebird"" is meant to signify the resurrection of these ballets in something close to their original form.  Liepa spent several years working on their reconstruction, finally mounting them in 1992 first at the Maryinsky and then at the Bolshoi.)

However, this is very much a film rather than a stage performance, and while I generally prefer a roving camera for ballet, when done skillfully, I feel that under Liepa's direction the camera angles and distance are frequently not used to best effect.  There's also too much offstage interpolation, such as horseback scenes, and many omitted staging transitions, and he shares an unfortunate tendency in some Russian ballet films for indulgence in cheesy and distracting special effects; overall both the directing and editing feel gimmicky at times.  It would have been far preferable to have filmed an actual onstage performance, which would have earned it a solid 5-stars.  (There's an obviously tacked-on segment of applause with bows from the principals and troupe at the end.)

In contrast, I felt that the troupe itself is superb; the dancers turned in uniformly excellent and beautiful performances.  (Ilze Liepa, in the role of Zobeide, is Andris' sister, and the stunning Ekaterina Liepa, as the Princess in ""The Firebird,"" is his wife.)  As another reviewer has mentioned, the Eunuch seems overdone, but I'm not otherwise familiar with this production of ""Scheherazade,"" and assume the costuming and choreography are taken directly from Diaghilev.  I agree somewhat with a different reviewer that Andrey Chistiakov's conducting of the Bolshoi State Academic Theatre Orchestra could have been more understanding of Stravinsky's uniquely astringent and urgent sound, but still it's quite well presented.  Judging from a few other reviews, it seems important to remember that while these ballets may or may not follow one or another familiar folk tale, they are significant in representing the artistic vision, at a supremely important time of change in the arts, of Diaghilev, Stravinsky (Rimsky-Korsakov's widow objected to this adaptation of ""Scheherazade""), Fokine, and the set and costume designers.

Both video and audio quality are fine on the DVD.  This is a Mosfilm production, released with English titles by Universal/Decca.  I note that Amazon also lists another 3-DVD set, ""The Magic of Russian Ballet,"" on the Philips label, appearing to credit the Kirov Ballet.  I haven't seen this set, but it cannot be a different production performed by the Kirov.  Philips is another Universal label, and a close-up of the cover shows ""Kirov Ballet Gala, Covent Garden"" (which must be the listed ""Nutcracker""), and ""Russian Ballet Gala, Red Square"" (which would be these three short ballets); the pictured Firebird character is obviously the same Nina Ananiashvili.  Following Liepa's lead, the Kirov however does have its own productions of just the two Stravinsky ballets on the Immortal label (again starring Liepa, this time with Gabriella Komleva, with choreography credited to Boris Eifman and Oleg Vinogradov), and another containing yet different productions of ""The Firebird"" and ""Scheherazade,"" among others, on a Kultur DVD.  It's probably also worth pointing out that although this ""Return of the Firebird"" film was shot in Moscow and employs a Bolshoi orchestra, this is *not* a production of the Bolshoi Ballet; Andris Liepa's Russian Seasons Dance Ensemble is an independent troupe, performing at both the Bolshoi and the Maryinski, and other venues. In addition to the three ballets, the DVD includes a dialog-free behind-the-scenes rehearsal film, and a rather long ad for a special-effects graphics company.

Addendum: Amazon also lists another version of both ""Firebird"" and ""Rite of Spring,"" together with Bartok's ""Miraculous Mandarin,"" performed by ""Moscow Classikal Ballet of N. Kasatkina and V. Vasilyov"" on a Videoland DVD that doesn't show up under the English titles; search for ""Sacre du Printemps,"" ""Feuervogel,"" or ""Wunderbare Mandarin.""  I've never seen this, but it might be of interest.",1154044800,59,5188,5.430884184308842

7970952,1,B00006L74J,"If you want good ballet, look elsewhere. If you like flashy, stagey, overproduced pieces with lots of sparkle, smoke, mirrors, weird camera angles, and other distractions, you might like this collection. The gaudy, irrelevant presentation grossly overshadowed what might have been good dancing - hard to tell. Watching these pieces (I won't call them ballet)  made me feel like I just survived a trip through the costume jewelry and cheap perfume counter at some cut-rate department store. The music was fine, but it was painful to watch the tawdry theatrics. I would be embarrassed to give this collection to anyone I know and won't be keeping it in my collection.",1515369600,2,665,5.045454545454546

7970954,5,B00006L74J,"I bought this DVD specifically to see Andris Liepa, one of my most favorite dancers. His beauty, grace, delicacy and expression made him mesmerizing. He always reminded me of heroes of Russian fairy tales you see in Russian books and on those wooden lacquer boxes with the fairy tale scenes. With his blond mane of hair and his gorgeous costume he looked just like he stepped out of the page of my old Russian book. His sister Ilze, Zobeida in Scherezade is an amazing actress/dancer as well and I won't even mention their famous father Maris. So this is a real treat to me even though I prefer a different version of Scherezade where the Golden Slave was Nikolai Tsiskaridze,  he had more charisma and passion and is also better looking :) He is my favorite along with Andris. But I am happy to have it anyway. It's a lavish production and very enjoyable. If you like a great ballet with Ilze Liepa, look for Pique Dame where she partnered with Tsiskaridze, their performance can't be beat, it was incredible, mesmerizing. These two outdid themselves in this ballet choreographed to music of Tchaikovsky by Roland Petit and based closely on Pushkin's book by the same name.",1507075200,2,1174,4.699029126213592
