8611036,5,B00F00A9U6,"In a career full of great live shows (The Rolling Stones at Imax, etc.) and sometimes lesser shows (Shine A light) , this one has got to be the best ever. A lot of hard prep work went into it, witness the choirs brought in on You Can't Always Get What you Want, etc.

This show features the best-ever live version of Satisfaction , and generally speaking best or near-best live versions of old classics. It's all the more remarkable given the age of the players ....

The Rolling Stones have sometimes detracted from the desirability of their live offerings by putting out just too many of those. I came across this DVD and CD set almost by chance, and I was blown away. Who would have thought they'd age so gracefully and so capably? In a long career of superlatives, they've just never been so good.",1402444800,,801,4.442176870748299

8611038,5,B00F00A9U6,"The show is excellent, perhaps one of their best performances. It covers their material from their greatest period, with just enough documentary elements to give you a better understanding of the show's significance to the group. Several reviewers have complained about the incessant jumping from one camera to another, and I do wish there were much less of that, but it didn't bother me nearly as much. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't seem to be selling the CDs separately, only packaged with a DVD (non-blu ray, but at least for Region A/1; see below).

The film makes you realize that not only are they the best rock 'n roll band ever, but Jagger and Richards are musical geniuses to have written so many incredible songs. Probably almost no one would have believed you if you had said in 1969 that they were going to come back to the same place 44 years to the day later and do the same show, but do it better, except maybe Jagger himself. I saw him on I think it was the Mike Douglas show back in the mid to late 60s, and when asked if he could see himself doing the same thing when he was 50 or 60, his reply was an emphatic ""Oh, yeah!"" This was the last show of their 50th anniversary tour, and he turned 70 shortly after the concert and looked like he could go on forever.

My warning is because this particular version of the blu ray disc is made for the European/African Zone B/2. The accent aigu on the ""e"" in edition is a give away, and it does say so in the product information, but the Amazon link for more information on what that means is worthless. There should be a much clearer warning. Some of the newer blu ray players will work with all regional material, but that's still the exception.",1390003200,3,1707,4.415873015873016
