4834785,4,B005MLTEIG,"This 2011 comedy-with-a-hard-edge derives its screenplay from Neil McCormick's semi-autobiographical 2003 book `Killing Bono: I Was Bono's Doppelgnger'. Shot mainly in Belfast (which doubles for the film's 1980s Dublin and London locations) and directed by Nick Hamm, the result is clever, witty and entertaining.

The core of the story is that, contemporaneously with the embryonic U2 - who initially called themselves `The Hype' - another schoolboy band in Dublin led by the McCormack brothers, Neil (the older, played by Ben Barnes) and Ivan (the younger, talented, guitar player played by Robert Sheehan) was starting up. Neil believes his band to be better than Bono's outfit, so when Bono asks Neil to release his brother Ivan from his band because he wants him for U2, Neil declines - the first in a long line of poor decisions on Ivan's behalf which costs his younger brother an `A-list' musical career.

The story then develops as in parallel with U2's rapid international success, Neil and Ivan stumble from one hilarious episode to the next and suffer continuous frustration and disappointment in `making it big'. Invariably, Neil makes poor decisions even when opportunity comes knocking and always believes his band - `Shook Up' - can make it with no help from U2, who offer to get them a recording contract and a place as support band on their tour, which Neil declines without ever consulting his brother. The tribulations include becoming indebted to a psychopathic Irish mafia gang leader; playing sleazy strip joints to an apathetic audience; scheduling a breakthrough gig to coincide with The Pope's mass in Phoenix Park; and escape to London where they again miss the chance of a recording contract but rent a run-down loft apartment from the excellent and extremely camp Pete Postlethwaite (in his final film role) who opens up a whole new social life for the boys.

Success in a small way did come eventually to the McCormacks' band but they might have been better known, and sooner, without Neil's self-confessed blunders. The story is fast-paced and the script good with plenty of laugh-out-loud dialogue, especially when involving Peter Serafinowicz as the frequently lethal but narcissistic Irish Mafia king, making a great success of a difficult role. Martin McCann is particularly convincing as Bono: he even looks like him, and has his persona to a `T'.

`Killing Bono' is a good way to spend a couple of hours and almost everyone I know who has seen it is of the opinion that it deserves a wider audience. You don't need to be a U2 fan, or even a rock music fan, to enjoy it.",1317772800,4,2605,4.954233409610984
4834786,5,B005MLTEIG,"This movie is based on a true story. There were 2 friendly rival bands playing in Dublin. One of them changed their name to ""U2"" and we know the rest of that story. Bono, wanted the guitar player off the rival band. Rather than directly ask the guitar player, Ivan, he asks his brother Neil, the band's leader, who refuses.  Neil believes his band will become better than U2 (who haven't cut their first album) and he is doing Ivan a favor. Ivan doesn't realize he had a chance to play for what will be the world's most popular band until...

Meanwhile, in order to become big, the band gets involved with the Irish mafia. They end up playing strip joints before borrowing money to go to London. Finally near the end of the movie, we understand the title. Neil believes all his problems are caused by Bono...if he could just kill him. The movie title is a hook and has little to do with this extraordinary film, a must for rock fans.

Martin McCann did an excellent job playing Bono. The movie was funny and entertaining.

Decent movie but the book was much better, as it more accurately portrays the real relationship between all concerned. The book even has a foreward from Bonno, so you know he gets the humor in it all. The movie deviates significantly from reality and even what was portrayed in the book. For instance, the gun thing never happened and was added by writers doing the screenplay for sow drama and action, pretty disturbing but whatever.

4834798,4,B005MLTEIG,"""Killing Bono"", one of the better films I saw at the 2011 Seattle International Film Festival, is a darkly funny, bittersweet and thoroughly engaging rock `n' roll fable from the UK, based on a true story. A cross between ""Anvil: The Story of Anvil"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol"", it revisits familiar territory: the trials and tribulations of the ""almost famous"". Dublin-based writer/aspiring rock star Neil McCormick (Ben Barnes) co-founds a band called Yeah! Yeah! with his brother Ivan (Robert Sheehan) right about the same time that their school chum Paul Hewson puts together a quartet who call themselves The Hype. The two outfits engage in a friendly race to see who can get signed to a label first. Eventually, the Hype change their name to U2, Hewson reinvents himself as ""Bono"" and-well, you know. In the meantime, the McCormick brothers go nowhere fast, as the increasingly embittered and obsessed Neil plays Salieri to Bono's Mozart. There are likely very few people on the planet who know what it feels like to be Pete Best (aside from Pete Best)-but I suspect that one of the players in this particular drama knows that feeling-and my heart goes out to him (no spoilers!). Nick Hamm directs a wonderful cast, which includes a fine swan song performance from the late great Pete Postlethwaite.",1344297600,,1302,4.922727272727273

The plot, two brothers, Ivan & Neil McCormick dream of starting their own band and making their way to the top in 1980s London/Ireland but instead their childhood friends of U2 are ambitious and successful in their careers of music. However, Neil calls all of the shots, making bad decisions that prevent both him and his Ivan of living the dream that U2 have now sought.

That is what you will be watching in this film.  I don't want to spoil it too much. Suffice to say that they have quite a struggle for several years.  U2 is not the focus here, but they are featured prominently and clearly went along with the whole thing.  It's sad to watch Neil and his brother clash over their dreams, but funny to watch them try to make it in the music industry.",1328832000,,513,4.03960396039604
4834803,4,B005MLTEIG,"3.8 stars

There are some heartwarming moments here, and some humorous ones, if not quite enough of either to make this truly great. But its heart is in the right place and the performances are all solid. U2 fans might want more of their heroes, and those who bought this for the appealing thought of its title might want less. I'm in the middle (I saw them on their War, Unforgettable Fire and Zooropa tours, so I'm a fan but no worshiper), and found the portrayal of the band pretty funny, all in all.

The best thing here are the original songs by Joe Echo, some of which are actually very good. Nice harmonies and melodies as he parodies/pays tribute to bands like The Cult and of course U2. The music makes or breaks this kind of film, so it's a real plus here.

It's no Spinal Tap, but it's engaging and if you like U2 or just remember the New Wave and '80s rock years, then you'll enjoy this pleasant Irish tribute to those times.",1327795200,,937,4.3125

Sure, they could have left out use of the tobacco drug and still had a great movie, but besides that flaw, I'd recommend this hidden gem to nearly anyone over 18. And even if you'd never heard of U2, it would STILL work.",1325548800,,363,4.432835820895522
4834806,5,B005MLTEIG,"Killing Bono is one of those films which has received surprisingly little public recognition, but which has been rated highly by nearly everyone who has seen it. It certainly deserves a much wider audience.

The story line is based on Neil and Ivan McCormick, who were contemporaries of Bono and the other members of U2. Like U2, they had a sixth form band and high aspirations. Neil always felt that his band should be at least as successful as Bono's and as U2 became the most successful band on the planet, this rivalry prompts him to make a series of disastrous mistakes as he seeks the success he craves. As the older brother he tends to make decisions, normally bad ones, without consulting Ivan. Ivan is also blissfully unaware that Bono wanted to recruit him for U2, but Neil vetoed it, and is understandably less than delighted when he does eventually discover this. Neil seems to have a special talent for getting Shook Up booked for the most inappropriate gigs. The one which clashed with the Pope's visit to Ireland and another in a sleazy strip joint being particularly hilarious.

This is quite a light hearted film, at times very funny and the sound track is excellent. When we hear the music of Shook Up, the McCormicks' band, it is actually rather good which really makes you wonder why they sunk without trace and were not more successful. There are some very good performances, notably by the late Pete Postlethwaite making his last appearance as Karl, the landlord, and Peter Serafinowicz as Hammond, the wonderfully insincere agent. Highly recommended!",1318636800,3,1573,4.843866171003717

8479488,2,B005MLTEIG,"Right off I'll tell you I'm a big fan of Neil McCormick's memoir, 'Killing Bono'. In it he relates going to school with the future members of U2 in a wry, self-deprecating tone. The book 'Killing Bono' is funny, but also the viewpoint of someone who's known the future Bono & the Edge since they were Paul Hewson & Dave Evans.

When I saw that the writers of 'The Commitments' & Ben Barnes were attached to the film of the book, I was pleasantly anticipating seeing one of my favorite music books rendered on film. I saw the film soon after it came out. I just watched it again, to verify my (unfortunately) negative impression of the project. Bottom line: this film is NOT 'Killing Bono'!

My objections started as the film opens with Neil McCormick (Ben Barnes) driving thru London, fulminating on how Bono is living HIS life. He pulls up across the street from where U2's new album 'The Joshua Tree' is being feted. Neil gets out & points a gun in Bono's general direction, saying 'It's my only option'. Which is all fine IF it had been in the book. But it wasn't. The idea of McCormick murdering Bono is suggested by Bono himself, during one of their interminable phone conversations.

Cut to Temple Mount school, where all the (late 20's to mid 30's) actors are playing at being 15. Same actors. No real effort given to make them look as if they were teenagers. Paul Hewson (Martin McCann) is standing in front of a notice posted on the bulletin board by Larry Mullins, who is searching for other students to form a band with. This scene, as well as those that follow it, point out 1) that NONE of the cast remotely resembles their real-life counterparts, & 2) Hewson is saintly, even at 15. This is just sheer & utter bs!

Bono is infamous for making speeches. As Liam Neeson recently pointed out, he'll talk on the phone for HOURS, without a pause for his listener to get a word in edgewise. He's humorous, & passionate about causes as diverse as AIDS, famine & debt in 3rd World countries, & his business ventures (Elevation Partners being one of them). The other members of U2 have been known to complain about Bono's causes interfering with recording or touring or ...

Meek & saintly, observing everyone with a secretive, Mona Lisa smile? Not hardly!

But I digress. Here's the deal: NOTHING in this movie occurs in the book! Sure, the characters names remain the same, but the script veers wildly off into the wild blue yonder, concocting events & conversations that never happened. It's a perfectly pleasant way to kill 2 hours, if you're not expecting to see the memoir on-screen. But for those of us who've read (& loved!) the book, it's a tragic waste of talent.",1440374400,,2678,4.56875

8479490,2,B005MLTEIG,"An interesting concept turned into a simply awful movie. Too simplistic an approach, and the actors were so bad at pretending to play their instruments it was impossible to overlook. The lead in the movie was such a stupid, selfish dolt that engendered no sympathy at all. No chemistry is the very weak love story they tried to mix in. Overall a waste of time and money.",1409788800,,370,4.537313432835821
