8636195,4,B00HV0ESB4,"I recently saw Casse-tte chinois in the theater (more on that later), and it made me return to the earlier movies in this franchise once again.

La Trilogie : L'auberge espagnole + Les poupes russes + Casse-tte chinois (2014 release from France; 3 DVDs; 357 min.) is a handy box set of the three films so far in this delightful franchise: DVD1 brings Lauberge espagnol (US title: The Spanish Apartment) from 2002, where writer-director  Cdric Klapisch introduces us to our main character, then 25 yr. old French student Xavier, who goes to Barcelona for a one year graduate degree, and ends up rooming with 6 other students from around Europe, leading to unexpected, but often funny and occasionally bittersweet (more sweet than bitter) situations. The movie became a box office bonanza in Europe (it also did quite well on the art-house theater circuit in the US). DVD2 brings the inevitable sequel Les poupes russes (US title: Russian Dolls) from 2005. Cleverly, rather than rehashing the Barcelona scene, Klapish returns with an update of what became of our characters 5 years after Barcelona, with Xavier now approaching 30 years old, and still looking for emotional order in his life. The movie did not come anywhere close to the commercial success of the first one. Maybe that is the reason why it has taken so long to get the latest movie. DVD3 brings Casse-tte chinois (US title: Chinese Puzzle) from 2013, where Xavier is now approaching 40, and his emotional life is once again a big mess. (I don't want to give away more of this plot-heavy movie.)

Couple of comments: this is a box set release from France, and hence if your DVD player cannot display Region 2 DVDs, do not buy this! Also, there are NO English subtitles, only French subtitles are an option, so if you don't understand French, do not buy this! I have no idea whether there are any plans to release this box in the US as a Region 1 DVD set and with English subtitles (I am 99% certain that Chinese Puzzle will be released in the US as an individual DVD at some point in the months to come.). Also, please note that these are straight reissues of the 3 movies, meaning there are no bonus materials of any kind on here, if that is important to you. I recently Chinese Puzzle at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and it only played for one week before disappearing. A shame, as it is a delightful movie, perhaps the best yet in this franchise. Heres hoping we don't need to wait another 9-10 years for the next chapter (what will the movie be called it then? Carbonnade flamande? Moules  la belge? ha!). Meanwhile, La Trilogie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1403740800,4,2636,4.674568965517241
