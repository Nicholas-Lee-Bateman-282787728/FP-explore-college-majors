5047410,4,B0071HPOXI,"With the amazing success of back-to-back pay-per-views in UFC 139 and UFC 140 fans were treated to some of the best fights and all around cards all year.  To end the year UFC attempted to set up what would arguably be the biggest heavyweight bout in history between Brock Lesnar and Alistair Overeem.  With a headline this big was there really any other reason to see this card?  Maybe not the biggest main event card if you're a casual follower but it was a pretty fun card to watch.

Nam Phan and Jimy Hettes opened the night in what would go on to become a pretty one-sided fight.  Phan demonstrated in his last fight some very technical boxing in a winning effort against Leonard Garcia while Hettes was coming off a successful debut four months earlier.  It was an interesting setup for the fight, being something of a style against style bout with Phan's technical standup going against Hettes and his judo and ground game.  Like I said, the bout is pretty one sided with one fighter's style just being too much for the other.  There are plenty of points where I thought it would be over but the losing fighter showed a tremendous amount of heart and survived until a unanimous judges decision.

Next was octagon veteran Vladimir Matyushenko taking on rising star Alexander Gustafsson.  Most fans will recognize Matyushenko as a fighter who has always been so close to the top of the division losing out only to the best of the best but always proving to be a dangerous fighter with some explosive power in his fists.  Then there's Gustafsson.  A lot of casual fans won't be able to pick him out from a lineup or even recognize too many of the people who he has left in his path, besides Matt Hamill and Phil Davis, but he's becoming something of the next Jon Jones of the light heavyweight division.  Although not entirely a physically imposing figure he is one scary fighter and looks to be the rising dark house of the division putting away everyone of his opponents besides one decision and his loss to Davis.  The fight itself was a heavy handed contest that ends in the first round with a resounding TKO.  The victor looked a bit shaky in the beginning but the finish definitely left a resounding answer as to the fighter's place in the division.

Since 2008 Jon Fitch has been widely recognized as the #2 welterweight in the division with only real reason for not being a champion is because of some guy named Georges St-Pierre, whoever the hell that is (Obviously joking).  He's beaten every fighter since in rather dominate fashion, with the exception of BJ Penn who he fought to a draw, but unfortunately for Fitch his style of winning typically involves wrestling his opponent down, controlling him, and grinding him out for three rounds.  Effective but not the most exciting fighting style.  His opponent Johnny Hendricks is a fellow wrestler but has demonstrated some really dangerous power in his hands knocking out three of his opponents since entering the UFC.  Now, when I tell you that you need to not blink or move away from your television screen I tell you this so that you don't miss one of the most startling and quick finishes I've seen all year.  It's quick, it's devastating, and it left my jaw on the floor.  Look to watch the replay on this sucker more than a few times.

When it was announced that Nate Diaz and Donald Cerrone were gonna fight in the co-main event I had a feeling that it was not only gonna win fight of the night, I really believed that it was going to be one of the best fights of the entire year.  Diaz, although not exactly friendly pre-fight time (or really anytime) with the people in his division, has always been a very exciting fighter.  His brother, Nick Diaz, and Nate have the same style of fighting where from start to finish they give it their all and showcase some of the all around best skills in any division.  Equally exciting is Cerrone, a big time fighter in the WEC who has finally been getting some real attention since fighting in the UFC, who also presents the same type of exciting all around game.  In the first round one fighter has a clear cut advantage, quickly putting the other fighter in what looked like a game finishing beatdown.  However the fight continues with much heart shown from the loser in what would go on to be a decently exciting fight, although it was clear that the victor was just absolutely dominate.

Now, there's really not much to say that most people don't know about Lesnar.  Former UFC champion who has been battling diverticulitis for the past few years makes his return to the title hunt against Alistair Overeem.  Overeem, not known to a lot of casual UFC fans was once a light-heavyweight for PRIDE before going on a three fight losing streak.  That's when he changed things up in a big way.  He put on a massive amount of muscle and stopped cutting the weight to the 205 limit and just let himself be this absolute monster of a striker.  He went on to win the Strikeforce heavyweight title, the DREAM title, and a title in the K-1 kickboxing world all within the past year (the first for any fighter of MMA).  To say the least, he was an exciting prospect for the UFC to get and they put him right in the thick of things against Lesnar with the winner getting the first shot at dos Santos' title.  Even as I type this I get the feeling most people know the outcome of this fight already but simply put the eventual victor looked downright scary.  Not only did he play to his strength and exhibit just an all around clinic of quick pain but he completely shut out the other fighters style, to the point that he looked simply outclassed.  This all took place within the first half of the first round.  Simply put, the victor certainly earned the right to his title shot.  As for the loser, again most people know what happened there.

Overall, not a bad card.  All the prelims go to decision with most of them being nothing spectacular.  The main card showcased the most interesting aspects of the whole card with the three TKOs.  It's certainly not gonna break boundaries or call for a mandatory viewing but it's definitely worth watching if given the time.",1327968000,5,6169,4.543891402714932

LESNAR VS OVEREEM

Ah yes the event that would be sold as the biggest heavyweight fight of all time [that is of course since the last time they said it, and would say again]. Overeem was debuting in the UFC after coming over from Strikeforce [saw his last fight there live in Dallas here in Texas] and he was going against big Brock Lesnar. Also there was the big grudge match between Donald Cerrone against Nate Diaz [can't stand him or his brother.]

Spoilers

DISC.1

1. NAM PHAN VS JIMY HETTES-the first round was all Hettes as he attacked from the beginning displaying excellent accuracy with his strikes. That accuracy also includes his ground strikes which is very impressive. He takes him down, slams him, and beats on him for most of the round, great showing from Jimy. The second round is pretty much the same but like the last Nam is game for it all, he never gives up. Jimy keeps using his Judo to get Nam down. From there you can see that this man is really very good with Jiu-Jitsu, this guy looks much better than a purple belt. The third round is even more impressive from both guys as Jimy dominates once again and Nam shows his heart. In the end Jimy takes a big UD.

2. VLADIMIR MATYUSHENKO VS ALEXANDER GUSTAFSSON-this one would see an up and comer in Alex taking on a veteran in Vlad. This fight lasts only a round with Alex using his range very well. Vlad attacks most of the time looking for that right hand. In the end that moving forward attack costs him as he walks right into a stiff jab knocking him to the ground. From there Alex jumps on him and gets the TKO victory.

3. JON FITCH VS JOHNY HENDRICKS-the next fight ended up being the most surprising of the night. This fight lasts seconds in fact I believe it was 12 seconds into the fight and Jon Fitch was sleeping. Hendricks blasts Fitch with a left and the fight is over. This of course got the ""KO of the Night"" award.

4. NATE DIAZ VS DONALD CERRONE-next up was the co main event of the evening and I was so looking forward to Diaz getting destroyed here. Diaz is a disrespectful black eye to the sport like his brother Nick and needs another beat down like the one he took from Rory McDonald. The first round is very entertaining but Diaz really lands those combinations. The second round seems a little better for Cerrone landing with his kicks but Diaz still controls with t boxing. The third round like the last saw Cerrone look a little better but Diaz still landed with the boxing leading to a UD win. This fight scored the ""Fight of the Night"" bonus.

5. BROCK LESNAR VS ALISTAIR OVEREEM-then came the fight every one was looking forward too. It was marketed as the biggest fight in the UFC's Heavyweight Division ever. They may have been right because these two are mammoth gladiators who are specialists in different areas. This was the classic grappler versus striker matchup that classics are made from. Lesnar is of course the grappler supreme with his amateur wrestling back ground and 2000 NCAA Championship. Then there is Overeem who is a world champion in not only MMA but also kickboxing and the only man to hold those titles at the same time. He was the Dream and Strikeforce Heavyweight champs in MMA and the K-1 World GP Champion, he is very dangerous standing up. The thing is he also holds multiple wins with submissions including a very impressive one over Vitor Belfort in Belfort's Pride FC debut. So going into this one I was worried about Lesnar's chances, still I was pulling for the former UFC Champ.

We all had goosebumps as Bruce Buffer yelled out ""This is the MAIN EVENT of the evening"", and of course his trademark ""AND NOWWW"" right before he introduces each fighter. When they met in the middle of the octagon it was incredible to see these giants standing in front of each other about to face off.

Things started slower then normal as Lesnar let some punches and even some kicks fly a little. Overeem stalked him down though with his hands at his side, a clear indicator that he did not respect Lesnar's stand up ability. When he was about to let loose Lesnar goes down for the single only to loose it, that was a big win for Overeem. Still Lesnar is able to cut Overeem but it does not effect Alistair at all, he continues to move forward looking for the kill. He breaks threw Lesnar's defenses and lands some big knees and even though Brock answers with one of his own it is not the same. Alistair pushes forward again landing more knees and a body kick that Lesnar tries to catch. Right back Overeem lands more knees and some punches loosing up on Brock. He backs away momentarily only to land a sickening body kick that sends Lesnar back and falling to a knee. Overeem smells the blood and comes in landing some heavy shots and the ref steps in to save Brock.

This was a huge fight with a lot of hype coming into it and rightfully so as ""The Reem"" very much delivered here. Lesnar was very humble in defeat and then announced his retirement from the sport. We were all a little upset but honestly we kinda saw it coming, but there is that steroid thing. As some may not know Alistair got caught before his next fight with insane amounts of testosterone in him. Now any one who has seen him when he was fighting at Light Heavyweight it is pretty obvious, so there is that if you want to look into it. But a win is a win and it was an exciting fight any way, of course we all also know how his last fight went as well

DISC.2

1. MANNY GAMBURYAN VS DIEGO NUNES-the opening fight of the night was in the featherweight division. The opening round showcased what each was thinking as far as a game plan goes. Nunes worked the outside with kicks and such while Manny worked for the takedown and eventually gets it for a short time. Round two favored Manny more so as he landed a big right hand and did get another take down. The third round looked like the first more so without the take down really. Nunes fought the fight on the out side and that lead to him getting the win.

2. JACOB VOLKMANN VS EFRAIN ESCUDERO-next up was the lightweights and two good ones at that. The first round here is great as these two grapple it up. Volkmann spends the entire round on top looking for position and ground and pound. Efrain on the other hand defends well and even had a choke at the beginning of the round. The first part of the second round was almost picture perfect frame by frame repeat of the first round until they are stood up. But from there Jacob looks to get Efrain's back and he does closing out the round dominating. Mix round one and two together and you have the third round until Efrain sinks in a power guillotine. From there he switches into a north south choke when they hit the ground and switched it back when they were back up. Still it was not enough as Volkmann gets the win.

3. DONG HYUN KIM VS SEAN PIERSON-I am a huge Dong Hyun Kim fan and was all about this next fight. Great first round with Kim controlling most of the round until he throws Sean only for Sean to gain superior position taking his back in the final seconds. The second round is controlled by Kim as he just lands combinations the entire time. With seconds left to go Kim lands a crane kick but Sean is saved by the bell as Kim pounces. The third round sees Kim control most of it on the ground until they are stood up, Kim gets the UD win.

4. ANTHONY NJOKUANI VS DANNY CASTILLO-great first round here as Danny comes in very determined to get the takedown. He gets it many times and even is close to taking his back. Towards the end Anthony spins and gets on top but the round ends before he can do too much. The second round would see Anthony land some nice knees, elbows and a bug right hand that stumbled Danny. But Danny hung in there and got that take down which aloud him to control and regain himself. The third round looked much like the first two with Danny getting the takedowns, which leads to his winning the fight by UD.

5. ROSS PEARSON VS JUNIOR ASSUNCAO-the first round would see these two circle the cage like crazy. Ross was walking Junior down while Junior was looking to counter, there was a takedown and some strikes landed. In the second round we pick up steam as Ross starts to find his range landing nice body shots a sick jab. We are treated to a few takedowns, actually one is a trip, basically a good round. The third round is really good with both guys looking good but Ross really coming alive as the round went on. That of course would lead him on to get the UD.

This was a good event over all in my opinion with some good fights and a stunning knock out. Sure things didn't go the way I wanted them on some fights but hey they are fights. Also one of the most fun nights I have ever had was that night but is a story for another day.

8508330,4,B0071HPOXI,I was at this show live to see the Reem best Lesnar. The under card was underwhelming but the main card had action. This introduced the fight fans to Hendricks and Gustaffson power.,1354406400,,181,4.515151515151516
8508331,3,B0071HPOXI,"In no way shape or form is this a review of the fights shown in this event or a review of the dvd. I've been wanting to review Brock Lesnar's MMA career for sometime or at least throw in my two cents about it. There is no doubt that Brock Lesnar is a superstar and a big draw for MMA and the WWE who has countless fans and haters alike. Me being apart of the latter disliked Lesnar not because he came from WWE or because of his skill but rather from his mouth and the stupid things that came out of it.

Another thing that erked me were fans of his screaming about how after Lesnar retired from the UFC he should be inducted into the UFC hall of fame. Why should he be inducted? Because he was a big draw and generated a lot of revenue for Zuffa? In no way did or does Lesnar deserve to be apart of the UFC legends roster. Lets see why.....

His debut was against Frank Mir who I'm sorry to say is like a middle man of the heavyweight division, he isn't the worst but he isn't the best. Frank was able to luckily get a hold of one of Brock's legs and get a submission after getting beat up by Brock. Inexperience was Lesnars biggest problem and downfall in his debut.

He than faced Heath Herring who was mediocre and on his way out of the organization. Lesnar with his size and strength bullied Herring around the octagon as he should have and got his first UFC win ultimately getting him a title shot with only 2 fights in the organization. No doubt his star power and a shallow division at the time got him his shot.

He went on to face Randy Couture for the heavyweight belt. Randy being way to old and undersized really had no business being in there with the over sized Lesnar but Couture was a bit of a miracle man and was known for his underdog status. In all actuality Lesnar should have beat Couture for the simple fact that he was twice Randy's size and Couture was just so old! Lesnar did win as he should have to become what I think was the fastest rising champion in UFC history, I think.

His first title defense was a rematch with Frank Mir who previously got a lucky win against Lesnar in his debut. This time Mir wasn't as lucky as he suffered a massive beat down from Lesnar that left his face looking like hamburger meat. Again for Lesnar's strength and size he should have been able to dispatch Mir with ease, at least this time around he had more training and experience under his belt and no excuses not to win.

In the middle of his career he developed an ailment that would become his toughest enemy yet, diverticulitis. It sidelined him for awhile and almost killed him, subsequently it would have the biggest role in Lesnar's later retirement.

After he recovered Lesnar would defend his belt against an actual quality opponent with Shane Carwin who could match Lesnars strength and size. Lesnar suffered his first actual beat down in his first round with Carwin. Luckily for Brock, Carwin gassed out in the second due to his high energy output of the first round and was choked by lesnar to retain his heavyweight title once again.

Once again Brock was stricken with diverticulitis and sidelined from action under going surgery to try and get rid of his ailment once an for all. After a lengthy time off he returned to action only to be dispatched quite easily by a smaller quality opponent in Cain Velasquez making Cain the new champion in the process.

His final fight and second straight loss was to rising heavyweight contender Alistair Overeem who made short work of Brock in a one sided beat down of sorts. After the fight Lesnar would retire from MMA.

So again what has Brock done in the UFC to be inducted into the hall of fame? Again he was a big draw with tons of star power, everyone wanted to watch him and see what he could and would do including me but in the end that's just not enough. 2 fights against a middleman, 1 against a mediocre opponent, a fight with an old and should have been retired Randy Couture and 3 fights with quality opponents with which he lost to 2 of badly does not qualify him as a hall of famer.

I wanted Brock to do good in the UFC and pose a true challenge to the heavyweight division even though I disliked him so. In the end his lack of true MMA skill, diverticulitis, a hurt ego and his families concern for his well being which is understandable, conquered Lesnar and his UFC career. Regardless of how big of a star he was or is he never accomplished nearly enough to be consider a legend of the sport.

This was something that I've been wanting to write for awhile but didn't want to post in an MMA forum as I've found one to many know it all's trying to one up each other in those forums. Agree or disagree with my statements of Brock and his stint with the UFC that fine by me but at least my opinion won't be lost in piles of forgotten forum threads lead by MMA know it alls.",1351555200,,4857,4.284623773173392
