5099996,1,B007N31ZZG,"DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!

This movie is not even worth the $1 rental from Redbox. It is not even about Kiara the BRAVE and was only called this to take advantage of the Disney Pixar release of BRAVE. This movie is about a boy named Super Cloud born from a cauldron of Bat wings, bugs, slime, and other ""gross"" things. It is not for little girls! It is the worse movie ever made and should be banned from all websites, rental machines, and retail stores. Absolutely horrible. So much so that the YouTube trailer won't even allow comments.

DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!",1340323200,34,581,4.37037037037037
5099997,1,B007N31ZZG,"Picked this up as a new release at Redbox. Clearly this company is trying to front-run major theatrical release.

I was not under the impression that this would be like Pixar's ""Brave"". However, it's not even worthy of home entertainment.... Regardless of the $1.00 rental cost.",1340150400,27,278,5.043478260869565
5100004,1,B007N31ZZG,"This movie is so awful the kids didn`t even want to finish it. Kiara is a minor character, the plot has nothing to do with her, the studio chose the name to capitalize on Brave, and the animation is awful at times. I paid 4 bucks for this and would have been better of flushing my money down the drain.",1367625600,3,302,4.05
5100005,1,B007N31ZZG,"My wife accidentally purchased this instead of the real Brave, and it made my eyes bleed.  Amazon should remove this movie, so more customers don't get duped.",1360281600,8,158,4.851851851851852
5100006,1,B007N31ZZG,"This movie is like a college attempt at making a video game and calling it a movie.  This movie is from India and it a knock off of Disneys Brave.  I cannot stress enough how bad this movie is.  There are characters that make no sense, the plot is not consistant through the movie, the writing is absolutely terrible.

Bottom line: I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1356480000,3,375,4.391304347826087
5100007,5,B007N31ZZG,The children liked it. It was a cute movie. Would give it for gift to someone else. The movie is cute.,1354320000,,102,3.9047619047619047
5100008,1,B007N31ZZG,"My title is the quote from a young girl watching this movie. She stopped after about 10 minutes and complained that all it was was ""some guy talking to a cloud"".

We all know this trashware is intended to suck in people ignorance of the fact it's not Pixar's Brave, but even taken by itself apparently it's terrible, too. The child couldn't be bothered to continue.",1353888000,4,365,4.53030303030303
5100009,5,B007N31ZZG,I personaly didn't care for the movie that much but my little sister LOVES it. It is worth watching it just to hear her laughing.,1353628800,,129,4.2
5100010,1,B007N31ZZG,"I bought this movie for my niece Ciara because it was supposed to be about a princess named Kiara. It was terrible! I didn't even watch the whole thing before we turned it off. I wish you could get a refund for a movie being so bad! In my opinion, it wasn't even a good ""kids"" movie, it had a lot of weird characters, violence, and poor decisions.",1353542400,4,347,4.117647058823529
5100011,1,B007N31ZZG,This movie was not at all what you would expect from the cover and title of the movie.  Our family turned off the movie after 10 min. of watching.,1351468800,,146,4.0344827586206895
5100012,1,B007N31ZZG,I wasted 40 minutes of my life on this. My 12 year old sister even asked to change it and she'll watch almost anything. This was the worst thing I've ever taken any time to watch,1350777600,,178,3.9722222222222223
5100013,1,B007N31ZZG,"I'm sorry but it's not even about Kiara. It's about some other kid trying to find is place in their world. My 3 kids (5, 7, & 8) couldn't sit through it. Just like all the other reviews it's not worth your time or money.",1347667200,,220,3.911111111111111
5100034,1,B007N31ZZG,"This movie is marketed to piggy back off of Pixar's Brave. Typically a crappy ripoff wouldn't bug me enough to write a review about it, but this movie is showing up with the suggested movies while browsing actual Pixar films. It seems that this movie is mostly selling to people who are mistakenly thinking it is Pixar's Brave. It was also pretty shady that they released this movie came out shortly before Pixar's Brave hit theaters. They are monetizing on the confused.",1342224000,11,471,4.7560975609756095
5100035,1,B007N31ZZG,Everything about this movie is a lie. The story is not even about the titular character Keira. She's just there to capitalize on Pixar's new movie. The story is actually about some kid named Super Cloud. The story is also a rip-off of Disney's Hercules. Wish I could give it 0 stars.,1341878400,3,283,4.461538461538462
5100036,4,B007N31ZZG,Nice movie for all.  It is not to often a chids movie with a lesson they can understand.  Good show!,1341878400,,100,3.95
5100037,1,B007N31ZZG,"I have never left such a negative review for anything, but I agree with all of the reviews.  This is not about Kiara.  Creepy animation.  Even the ""hero"" is scary looking most of the time.  I let my 4 year old daughter pick this and had to suffer through.  Try to avoid paying money to rent this! Ugh.",1341619200,8,301,4.120689655172414
5100038,1,B007N31ZZG,"We knew before we turned this on that it wasn't the same as Disneys version but we thought that it would at least go along with what the description said. We made it about 20min into it and gave up. We never saw a little girl, just a bunch of talking head planets and strange creatures. Nothing my kids (7yr boy & 4yr girl) cared to watch at all.",1341360000,10,346,4.028985507246377
5100039,1,B007N31ZZG,"As the creators of this garbage intended, my 4-year-old daughter saw the cover at a Redbox and wanted to see it.  I explained it WAS NOT the Disney Brave (that came out last week as of this writing), but she was still interested.  We made it about 30 minutes in when she told me the movie was confusing and ""so bad"".  The movie isn't really about Kiara (who looks enough like the princess from Brave) but about a strange boy named Super Kloud.  Yup, his name is Super Kloud.  Its Indian original title is ""Super K"".

No need to go into the plot - just avoid this.  It's amateurish in every way.  This garbage is put together by an Indian company, Shemaroo Entertainment, that makes atrocious kids' movies.  The trailer on this one was for ""Puss 'n Boots"" - the one you've never heard of with William Shatner, or so they claim.",1340928000,14,826,4.381578947368421
5100040,1,B007N31ZZG,"Obviously, most of what has been said is correct.  They are trying to play on people's correlation of Disney/Pixar's Brave.  This moving is not about Kiara and she is only a minor character.  The writing and plot are terrible and the animation is hokey.  This is a pattern for this company, since it seems that they also try and get rentals based on the popularity of Madagascar 3 with their other movie ""Life's A Jungle"".  These have to be two of the worst animated films ever made.",1340668800,12,483,4.505747126436781
5100041,1,B007N31ZZG,"Not even my 6 year old could finish this horrible movie! Not worth the 1.30 redbox fee. The obvious deceitfulness of the production company is appalling, capitalizing on the release of Disneys Brave. Don't waste your time, trust me.",1340409600,23,232,4.9743589743589745
5100042,1,B007N31ZZG,"I cant believe how bad this is. It could not be any worse. Bad animation . Really unintelligent story. It is worth the rental money because it is like watching a train wreck .I don't think anyone, including the producers have watched this the whole way through.",1340409600,11,261,4.574468085106383

8519628,5,B007N31ZZG,"This movie is a masterful work of post-modernist surrealism. It is so cryptic that it completely alienates the viewer from the experience. It is the work of the viewer to truly understand the intersection of the grotesque visuals, emotionless voice acting, and the overarching narrative themes. Well done! Truly deserving of praise!",1466208000,5,332,5.403846153846154
8519629,5,B007N31ZZG,Loved it it was funny and very cute plus kiara the brave came out before brave so brave stole the idea,1460851200,,102,3.9047619047619047
8519630,1,B007N31ZZG,"My husband borrowed this movie from a friend for our 3 year old son and daughter to have something different to watch. We thought it may be based loosely off of Disney's Brave. We were SO wrong. I didn't see the beginning but what I saw of it made me want to gouge out my eyes. It is an insult to those who know what they are doing in the animated film industry. The script, plot, acting, computer animation, everything was so choppy, not written well at all and made no sense. The title character didn't do anything at all. The characters contradict themselves. The story doesn't move along smoothly and doesn't get to the point. I finally took the DVD out and put in something else. I will never allow it in my house again. Unfortunately I have to give it a star rating to post this. If I had my way it would be a no star rating.",1447027200,,831,4.2
8519631,2,B007N31ZZG,"Completely fails the Bechdel test.  Animation is slightly less jarring than the first generation of VeggieTales.  But, the 10 year old liked it.",1440115200,,144,5.217391304347826
8519632,5,B007N31ZZG,This show is amazing! It's so bad me and my friend almost died laughing at it! :D,1433376000,2,81,3.823529411764706
8519633,1,B007N31ZZG,"I first saw this movie at a sleepover at my friends house. I am someone who judges movies by the animation and this movie is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!we where all like oooh, brave! But then it was: WHAT IS THIS DARNED TOOTIN' PIECE OF POOP!",1404086400,,241,4.627906976744186
8519634,1,B007N31ZZG,"I'm not gonna lie: I'm a sucker for cute, corny kids' movies. This is not one. This is what happens when you feed a film script to a demon and microwave the stuff that comes out of its butthole.
The characters are rendered in some sort of shadowy, doughy CGI, and they're very unsettling. They kind of remind me of the Greek black marble statues with just their scleras painted white. The main character, Super Kloud, terrified my young neighbor to no end. I was babysitting her overnight and we watched this movie, and at 2 in the morning she comes to me in the dining room and says Super Kloud is in her closet.
Watching her sleep.
Touching himself.
You know what? I would not be surprised if he actually was.
As far as the plot goes: the diologue is like the jarbled mutterings of a schizophrenic prison inmate as he writes his manifesto with his own waste on the walls. The storyline itself is jumpy and jittery. It gave me flashbacks to the night I tried meth.
If you think you can handle tasting the misty halcyons of a truly dark, depraved world, rent Kiara the Brave. If you want to keep your sanity, go watch literally any other movie; I guarantee it has more merit.",1367798400,4,1175,4.394495412844036
