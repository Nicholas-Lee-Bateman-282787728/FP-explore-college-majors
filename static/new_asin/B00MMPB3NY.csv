8673066,5,B00MMPB3NY,"One of Joe E. Brown's early movies (1932) that takes place on Catalina Island where Joe through a case of mistaken identity gets into a swimming race - the only problem is he can't swim.  But he agrees to enter the race mainly to impress a girl played by Ginger Rogers and a $25,000 prize for the winner.  His main opponent is played by Preston Foster.  Joe gets some coaching and moral support from Farina of the Little Rascals.  And Joe has an ace up his sleeve or thinks he has in an unsinkable bathing suit he invented.  Brown would have been 40 when he made this movie, and as you'll see, was in tremendous shape.  It's a movie with a lot of laughs including several of his trademark yells, that I remember watching on television in the 1950's.",1426204800,6,749,4.35251798561151
8673067,5,B00MMPB3NY,"Great quality disc, and if you love Joe E Brown you will want to own this movie. I bought it for Ginger Rogers alone as I happen to think she is great in all she undertakes, even in silly films like this. Young Ginger is as sweet as apple pie with cream. Bring on more of her early movies for her many fans to see. A good few could do with being sourced and spruced up for us and future generations to love.",1413331200,9,407,3.9156626506024095
