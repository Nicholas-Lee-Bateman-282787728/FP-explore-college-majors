Shame on Mr Holder for not correcting this -- long after the fact. I called his office and got NO RESPONSE from him when I asked for a refund for false advertising. Eventually Amazon refunded my money. (Thank you.)

The video is less than one hour. That being said, it is way overpriced. There is nothing extensive or genuinely useful discussed on the stated topic. I have watched his (sample) videos of smoking cessation sessions -- and he does not even discuss those ""signature"" techniques he uses in those videos!

In retrospect, I personally would rather have purchased 10 used books on the topic of Smoking Cessation for the same price. The information he gives could have be written on a single page. I kid you not. Don't WASTE your hard earned money on any of this guy's products. I feel bad writing this, but if I were teaching hypnosis and I were as intelligent as that man is, I would offer something far more useful to the students.",1453248000,,972,4.542857142857143
