2648042,5,B000HXDWGY,"This wonderful DVD gives a comprehensive well-made documentary on the Vikings.  For hundreds of years, they meant terror as raiders from the north.  They had their ""empire"" around Europe and even to Russia.  However, they changed from pagan to Christian and keep their adventurous spirit

This film re-build the long Viking ship in sail and oar across the Atlantic into America East Coast. They interact with Native Americans and both sides suffered casualties around the first millennium - 500 hundred years before Columbus!

This is a good inductory to American history as to who are the first great explorers - Eric the Red and his son, Leif Erricsson
or Christopher Columbus.",1331424000,2,679,5.081081081081081
2648043,5,B000HXDWGY,"Boy do I love reading books and watching videos about these guys!  Two ships with only 120 men could storm a town of thousands, pillage it senseless, and get away clean to do it again 20 miles down coast.  Once their ships were so full of booty they couldn't plunder another town, they headed home, only to have to worry about later-launching Vikings who might decide to plunder them!  How such barbarism could be so effective for centuries without anyone finding a way to thwart them is a mystery to me, but there it is.
Another mystery is why all of ""civilized"" Europe stayed within comfortable sight of land, while only the Vikings had the courage to sail beyond the horizon, braving the monsters and the end of the earth.  Some say it was just greed, but that greed had to be backed up with a lot of courage and skill.  It took another 500 years before Columbus risked a western voyage.",1313712000,13,890,4.469135802469136
2648044,4,B000HXDWGY,"This DVD is listed as 62 minutes, but the running time w/o the extras is 37 minutes.  An unseen, male narrator describes the events. Action is suggested rather than portrayed. The arial views as impressive.  It's fine as a filler for my 6th grade history class.",1293753600,12,261,4.6521739130434785
2648045,5,B000HXDWGY,"compared to the old nova series that i love, kids like this imax version of history better, due to the filming style in short snips and very colourful.",1272931200,10,151,4.428571428571429
2648046,4,B000HXDWGY,"I rented this dvd to show to my 9 and 7 year olds to supplement our study of the Vikings. It was a big hit. It's not childish at all, but was very interesting and appropriate for their ages. The violence of the Vikings is discussed but not shown. The reenactments helped a lot to hold the attention of the kids too.",1264636800,30,315,4.096774193548387
2648047,4,B000HXDWGY,"I saw this film originally in the omnimax format, then purchased it when it became available this October.  This is a great, watchable overview of the vikings in their journeys to North America.  Lots of reinactments - the ususal omnimax scenic photography.  The film does NOT go into detail of the vikings influence in the east - if you are interested in that, I'd recommend the NOVA viking video.

Also - the NOVA film (2 hours) goes into greater detail on all their topics -but it is a dryer more 'academic' film.

Overall - great intro film if you find yourself intrigued by the Vikings :)",1166400000,39,593,4.556603773584905

8142236,4,B000HXDWGY,"Good documentary. Gave some insight in understanding what possibly happened and why the Vikings did not leave any influence in the New World.  It was intersting to learn that their constant skirmishes with the native inhabitants at the time had something to do with them leaving and not returing. Although the initial encounter with the local inhabitants was friendly, when things got sour, sounds like their numbers were too small to take on such a larger number of determined warriors (who we know today as Native Americans)",1383523200,2,526,5.045977011494253
