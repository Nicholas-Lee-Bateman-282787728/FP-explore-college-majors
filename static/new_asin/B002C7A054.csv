But I too have a multi-regional player and was able to thoroughly enjoy Sir Derek's informative and pleasurable tour of Dicken's England.  The DVD itself deserves the full five stars, if not more.  It's Amazon's lack of proper description that merits a single star.",1326412800,2,347,4.75
8363509,1,B002C7A054,The web site says this is an all region DVD.  It would not play on my regular DVD player (it is not clear if the problem is that the player is a blue ray.  It plays all other conventional discs).  Fortunately I have an all region player connected to an old TV which will play it.  Most people would not be in this situation so the product description needs to be clarified.  Unfortunately Amazon's all automated customer service does not handle this kind of situation very well.,1325462400,4,478,4.448275862068965
