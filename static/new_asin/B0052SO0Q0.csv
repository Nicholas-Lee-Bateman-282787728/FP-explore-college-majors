4530780,5,B0052SO0Q0,excellent acting by John Payne  & a topic that happens in today times as well,1426636800,,77,4.133333333333334
4530781,5,B0052SO0Q0,Never saw that side of John Payne before. Reminded somewhat of Orson Welles.....,1425081600,2,80,5.230769230769231
4530782,5,B0052SO0Q0,"This is one of those movies that, at first looks like a typical B movie with no plot and bad acting. I watched with that in mind but instead found a very captivated plot and well orchestrated story with evolving and dynamic characters. I can't say I enjoyed the political corruption type politics but it all worked well in keeping my interest. It's a decent movie and I give five stars because I like clean and entertaining movies as this movie definitely qualifies.",1419292800,5,466,4.626506024096385
4530783,3,B0052SO0Q0,I thought the storyline good and actor John Payne was excellent as the boss as was William Bishop as the  dodgy lawyer.,1385769600,,119,4.409090909090909
4530784,4,B0052SO0Q0,"John Payne is Matt, one of the Brady Brothers, modern day outlaws who make up the rules as they go along. WW I veteran Matt inherits his older brother's political machine in the 1920s and gradually becomes even more sinister and ruthless.
His flaws are fatal. When he does not get the woman he loves, he drunkenly marries another on the fly, dooming both to a hell on earth. He would cut a deal with the devil if possible but instead settles for corrupt politicians, cops, and mafia types, all of which eventually turn on him.
A morality tale of how ""eventually everybody does business with everybody.""",1364947200,2,602,4.635514018691588
4530785,4,B0052SO0Q0,"Very well known for his musical talents, Payne sought to play this dramatic character role.  His demise is traced step-by-step.  A good stellar performance, I  prefer Payne in A-noirs like 99 RIVER STREET directed by Phil Karlson.  He is not especially convincing as a small-town political boss who deserves his comeuppane.",1363478400,,323,5.2745098039215685
4530786,5,B0052SO0Q0,"I checked out the cover, it looked great,popped it in, it worked, what more can I ask for. I'm not picky, I just want to watch a non-scratched real dvd.",1360972800,,152,4.1
4530787,5,B0052SO0Q0,"A good depiction of how one mans politics and crime connections worked together to build the system and neighborhoods we live under, and how prosparity was based on your race, color and political association. This was evident in every city across the country powerful Irish, Italian or Jewish gangs worked their influence through fear, violence and money to control people in the community to vote for their candidates. These gangs had the power to control jobs, business's and the police to the point where they would eventually select a Presidents. Powerful acting and story.",1352678400,3,577,5.148936170212766

4530789,4,B0052SO0Q0,John Payne made some very good lower end noir pictures in the 50s. This one is the thinly disguised story of KC boss Tom Pendgast. Well worth watching.,1455580800,,151,4.428571428571429
4530790,5,B0052SO0Q0,"This is a great old classic, with  morals and values. ""Bad guys don't win"". Good acting.",1454198400,,88,4.5

4530793,2,B0052SO0Q0,not one of his better movies,1437177600,,28,3.8333333333333335
4530794,5,B0052SO0Q0,These old movies are much better than some of the ones out today.,1433808000,,65,4.076923076923077

4530796,5,B0052SO0Q0,"Great movie!  That was ""real acting"" back in those days as they HAD to act, not a lot of special effects to ""carry"" the movie in box office!",1430611200,3,140,4.0
4530797,5,B0052SO0Q0,Good film.,1428969600,,10,4.5
8454255,1,B0052SO0Q0,"I don't know why anyone wants to watch a movie like this one. I learned nothing and was not entertained  there wasn't a single likeable character, certainly not the protagonist. The abused wife was not developed enough to be likeable, she seemed rather nice though, and I do not enjoy watching nice people abused. Was the movie at least credible? Is this how our cities were run? Are they still? We like to boast about being the best there is, the best country in the history of the world. No evidence of that here.",1489104000,3,515,4.4787234042553195
8454256,2,B0052SO0Q0,"For a movie made in 1956, I thought the plot and acting was OK.  Reason for the low rating is I just can't live with the terrible hum/sometimes pulsing hum in the audio track.  Wonder if Amazon downloaded this version off of Youtube or something?",1485475200,,246,4.444444444444445

8454259,4,B0052SO0Q0,I like this movie a lot but it is a little sad because of the greed and loneliness of the main character and how he ends up losing pretty much ev everything that he thought was important.,1484006400,,187,4.081081081081081
8454260,2,B0052SO0Q0,don't like it. can't remember the theme of the story,1483574400,,52,4.3
8454261,4,B0052SO0Q0,Great story. Kept my attention til the end. Glad it was free. Nothing like a good one gangster flick without the blood and gore popular today! Good acting. I especially liked the storyline with  The Bosses Wife. That actress was very believable as an unloved wife who wanted her husband to want her. Great movie worth a look!,1481328000,,325,4.603448275862069
8454262,5,B0052SO0Q0,"Pretty Good Movie, I enjoyed it! I was impressed by the acting by Gloria McGhee she did a great job and very convincing!",1480636800,,120,4.260869565217392
8454263,4,B0052SO0Q0,"Unusual film I'd never heard of, starring John Payne in middle age, years after he hit Hollywood in the 1930s and started out with lighter fare including musicals.  Morality tale about the price of conceit and arrogance among the powerful.  Good supporting performances.",1478649600,2,270,5.255813953488372
8454264,3,B0052SO0Q0,Good movie.  Filming of older movies has a quality and depth that current films no longer project.  For one who favors the Classics or black and whites this is one elected.  Enjoy.,1459209600,2,180,4.5625
