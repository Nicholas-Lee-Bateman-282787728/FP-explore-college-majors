I thought that it was a really neat and funny cartoon.  I am going  to buy this DVD. I recommend this to anyone.  Also, you are getting your  moneys worth with this DVD.

1055079,5,630560925X,"This is one amazing DVD. It's just chock full of information about and entertainment from this very pioneering TV legend Bob Clampett. People in awe of Jim Henson need to go back several decades and see what inspired  him. What's so wonderful is that the live-action puppet show translated so  well into the full color cartoons. The spirit of the characters remains in  tact, including that innocent, hilarious Cecil who was the inspiration for  Bullwinkle. The features on this disc are truly the best you can get from a  DVD and Image Entertainment needs to be saluted. There's a wonderful  commentary segment from one of the actors Stan Freberg that is funny and  enlightening. The meticulous vision that Clampett had for TV as a medium,  when it was just starting to come into being, is clearly underscored on  this entire disc. I almost wish it had more and pray that more episodes  will get released on DVD, including the handful produced by John Krisfalusi  (Ren and Stimpy) in the late 80s. Even if you've never heard of Beany and  Cecil, somehow because everyone's borrowed from them in one way or another  (from the Muppets to Captain Kangaroo to Rocky and Bullwinkle to Sifl and  Olly), they seem vaguely familiar. This is why God made DVDs.",951696000,13,1252,4.7627906976744185
1055080,5,630560925X,This DVD is GREAT!  The audios of Freberg and Clampett re: the Beanie Era are enlightening and touching. There are 4 of the original puppet versions of Time For Beanie and many of the animated episodes that folowed the  puppet era. I only hope that more will be released in the not distant  future. I plan to inflict the appropriate parts of the DVD on all 6 of my  grand children.,949449600,5,381,4.323943661971831

And this time, no tape to rewind, no commercials to give your brain a rest. My wager is this: If you can stand to watch more that a half dozen of these cartoons at one sitting  AND you can stand hearing that silly theme song more than twice an hour...well, your a more devoted fan than I. It's all good, with some rare bits and examples of early works and drawings. But you can get over-saturated. Taken sparingly, a wonderful visit with what made you laugh when you were younger! Three stars for quality of reproduction and just for hanging around that long!",1373241600,,713,4.5271317829457365
1055171,5,630560925X,"Okay, after getting the second B&C DVD, never having seen the show as a child, I was hooked. I had to break the piggy bank to get this!

First some comments on the original TIME FOR BEANY episodes (4 are here from 1949 to 1951). These would be an acquired taste for the modern viewer, but if you give these Black & white kinescopes a chance, you could see why Harpo Marx and Albert Einstein loved this show as much as the LA Kids who grew up with this program. Some interesting tales involving (in order), Beany trying to cure Cecil of ""ambrosia"" (amnesia), our heroes going to Washington DC with a French professor to assist then-president Harry Truman (a puppet caricature that has his Missouri syntax nailed-the scene where the spoofed HST does a piano duet with Cecil singing ""Ragg Mopp""  is classic!) and Dishonest John (yet to perfect the ""Nya-ha-ha"" catchphrase) tricking Cecil into doing dangerous and ridiculous stunts after signing him as an entertainment client. For the kiddies, B&C give an on camera warning not to try the stunts seen in this episode. There is a charming whimsy and sweetness to the humor in this puppet show with enough biting satire for adults to distinguish it from the sickening modern mush of the likes of Barney the Dinosaur in our own time that no adult of normal intelligence would stomach. Incidentally, many comparisons are often made between the Beany crew and its contemporary competition THE BULLWINKLE SHOW. Turns out this is more than coincidence. Bullwinkle writer Lloyd Turner was a major writer for the Beany show at this point.

On to the B&C ""Bob Clampett Car-too-oons"" that enchanted the younger siblings (and in many cases the parents) of the fans of the 50s puppet version. Clampett took advantage of the limitless possibilities of animation to let his imagination run WILD with B&C beyond the limits of the puppet show. These shows combine the charm of the puppet version with Looney tunes insanity that makes you have to rewind some episodes because they are sometimes so bizarre you can't believe what you're seeing! ""So What & The 7 Whatnuts"" is an outlandish tale of our heroes going to ""Lost Wages"" where they catch caricatures of Satchmo, Desi Arnaz, Harpo Marx, and Elvis. Dishonest John tries the wicked witch number with the poison apple on the lovely ""So What (a nightclub singer). The punishment dealt to Dishonest John in this foolishness is a sight to behold. ""Dj the DJ"" is a stinging lampoon of the music industry of the early 1960s (Cecil does ""Ragg Mopp again and Dishonest John records him in a junkyard because ""all successful records these days are junk."" The gags and puns (which include an Alvin and the Chipmunks takeoff) fly fast and furious and the tale is so surreal you cannot believe what you're watching. ""Beanyland,"" which spoofs ""Disneyland"" is another instance of Clampetts runaway imagination unleashed, but there are sweet aspects to this one that you will miss if you only watch it once. ""The Mad Isle of Manhattan"" has Dishonest John being the victim of someone else's con schemes for a change, in this case an unscrupulous television producer. The ""Snorky"" toon, which is without B&C, DJ, or Captain Huffenpuff, is the only really weak cartoon in the set, but that's forgivable after all the good stuff.

Although I agree with reviewers that say the set is too heavy on Bob Clampett trivia, a few of the commentaries (including the legendary Stan Freberg who voiced the puppet show episodes) are interesting as is Clampett's tale of the origins of B&C. One intriguing segment features a story conference and stills of a 1954 episode that spoofed Joe McCarthy, which is probably now lost, and some color behind the scenes footage of Time for Beany. I agree that the producers of the DVD would have been better off with more B&C cartoons (there were 78 altogether and only 24 on the two current disc sets-no excuse-we want more!) as well as the surviving Time for Beanys. In either case, I'm so hooked right now that I'm willing to get the VHSes of the remaining B&C toons as methadone for my B&C addiction.

Simply put, these are the Cadillacs of TV cartoons-get them! Hanna Barbera had nothing on these (although the DIRTY POOL cartoon bears some suspicious similarities to the famous SWIMMING POOL episode of THE FLINTSTONES-who Dishonest John actually name-checks during this tale)! To the Clampett family, great work, but WE WANT MORE B&C TOONS ON DVD!",1367539200,2,4446,4.8217562254259505

And what a collection!  I play this DVD for my 3 year old god daughter and she loves it.  Laughs in the same places I always do.  Can sing Ragg Mopp at the top of her lungs.  And the bottom of her lungs, too, come to think of it. Like Rocky and Bullwinkle, it has enough jokes that adults get, to make it watchable by ALL ages. Ren and Stimpy and Powerpuff Girls also had a lot of things that only adults would get.

1055219,4,630560925X,"This is a wonderful compendium of the classic world of Bob Clampett's ""BEANY & CECIL"", first giving us 12 beautiful copies of nicely chosen ""BEANY & CECIL"" animated cartoons and at least four episodes from the characters' beginnings, a live puppet show called ""TIME FOR BEANY"" which featured the voice talents of Daws Butler and Stan Freberg.

I tend to like the animated cartoons because there is more of a sense of Bob Clampett's classic LOONEY TUNES inherent there, with fast little asides and topical humor filtered throughout which most kids probably didn't originally pick up on when first enjoying the series in the '60's, but that is why it worked well.  The supporting characters were colorful enough to appeal to the kids and a lot of fun, characters like Davey Cricket, Beepin' Tom (from the Planet Saturnin'), Careless the Mexican Hairless, Buffalo Billy, Pop Gun (a takeoff on wild west characters brought to life by actor Walter Brennan) and my favorite, Li'l Ace from Outer Space, a mouse always on a space mission that fails...oh, and let's not forget Hare-cules Hare, the Brainy Bunny, who speaks in Spike Jonesian inflections when drawing punctuation signs in midair and proves, with his brawny dad that it takes equal parts brawn and brain to get by.

But that is what is wrong with this collection--you don't get to see many of the shorts that introduce these characters and more.  This is an introductory set that gives you examples of why this core group of characters were so wonderful.  When I bought this, I hoped so much to see, eventually, the remainder of the series coming out of its dusty old vault corner and being issued with the same frequency as it was once on VHS tape.  I don't know why this project was not continued, but here's hoping that new customers come to acknowledge this product and learn more about this series and also learn to enjoy it on its own level.  You can see why John Kricfalusi (""REN & STIMPY"") was brought in originally to revive the series.  Those who saw that revival did eventually get samples of the original series interspersed in the weekly airings, but the network and the company distributing the show did not understand the reasons why the characters were so interesting and funny.  It was never given a chance.

I hope that some video company out there tries hard to work with the Clampett estate and bring the full run of this series, with more ""TIME FOR BEANY"" episodes, back to the DVD shelves.",1188432000,2,2466,4.740654205607477

1055221,2,630560925X,"While the non-Beany-and-Cecil-cartoon stuff was mildly interesting, it's stupid to have any of it at the expense of more of the cartoons.

1055222,5,630560925X,"The only reason I bought this was to fill the $25 minimum requirement for free shipping, and it was the only cartoon in the 3.99 selection.  What a score!!  I had no idea who Beany and Cecil were, but they had a 4-5 star customer rating, so I figured either my 5-year-old daughter or I would like it.  We BOTH love it!  I am not big on TV, but to have this old stuff, with all the added ""lost stuff"" 30's, 40's to the 70's stuff--what a lesson.  I seldom take the time for commentary, but it's a history lesson on this DVD. It was also neat to show my daughter how people (me included) were at one point limited to black and white television, yet alone the debut methods of animation.  What a true treat, with a funky twist --certainly makes me ashamed of today's cartoons.

This is one of those cartoons that fits many an audience, for reminiscing if nothing else.  Blow $10 on it if you get the chance, esp if you're an B and C fan.  This is great.",1093478400,39,950,4.147540983606557

1055224,5,630560925X,"As my daughter was growing up, I wanted her to see all the things that I loved as a kid, and it was enormously frustrating that Beany & Cecil cartoons were almost impossible for me to find.  Perhaps the show was broadcast in other areas of the United States, but I couldn't find the show on cable and couldn't find any video compilations.  At any rate, this DVD corrects the situation by making a number of classic Beany and Cecil cartoons available again.
The Beany and Cecil cartoons were minimally animated, with few frames per second, little movement, and little background detail.  Moreover, each episode was laced with one excruciatingly bad pun after another (ever since first seeing these episodes as a kind, whenever I hear of any atoll, I instantly think of the No Bikini Atoll).  So what makes them so much fun?  First, they knew many of the jokes were bad, but they kept throwing them at you, and in such a great spirit, that you couldn't resist the fun.  Second, the voice-overs on the show were just great.  Stan Freberg, one of the greats of the business, did a lot of the voices, including Cecil and the show's villain Dishonest John (who could ever forget that laugh!).  Many of the other characters were voiced by various people over the course of time (Beany, for instance, was done by both Daws Butler and Mel Blanc).  But whoever was involved, the voice talent was first rate.  Third, the humor, though frequently intentionally bad, was nonetheless acute, and anyone watching the show will be consistently amazed by the wit and comedy.  The one thing that I wonder about is the topicality of much of the humor.  Will kids today know who Gina Lollobrigida is to get the joke about the low low bridge?  Or do they know who Dinah Shore was for the singing dinosaur?  I suspect that they will miss a lot that previous generations got, but I also suspect that it won't matter.  Dishonest John's laugh and schemes are timeless.",1067644800,20,1942,4.637426900584796
1055225,4,630560925X,"It was with some trepidation I plugged this DVD into my player and hit the ""play"" button.  Would my fond memories of Beany, Cecil, Dishonest John, Go-Man Van Go, and most of all, SnORky, be revived?  Or would it just seem something enjoyed a long, long time ago that was no longer funny?
I should not have feared!  This wonderful DVD presents a pile of stuff related to Beany and Cecil, including some of the original Beany and Cecil puppets which, for me, did seem a little dated.

Ya-ah-ah, have no fear because the animated cartoons 1) look great; B) sound great; III) are so cleverly written they are as entertaining at 46 as they were when I was 6!  Most of my favorite episodes are here:  SnORky, Go-Man Van Go, the Leopard Who Lost his Spots, etc.  All I could ask for is pulease release the rest of the cartoons on DVD!
This DVD is entertaining for old and young alike, though the oldsters may have to explain some of the beat jokes to the youngsters.  Or just turn and say, ""don't bugs me, man, don't bugs me!""",1002067200,70,1019,4.354497354497354
1055226,5,630560925X,"Sea-ing Cecil in fantastic DVD quality should make Beany's propeller hat spin faster than Linda Blair's neck.  Babyboomers who assume kids today would never appreciate this inspiring duo are failing to take responsibility for educating their children. A simple and guaranteed method exists to indoctrinate their spongey little minds into a full appreciation for wonderfully  bad puns that AT LEAST make them THINK about context in relation to the English language.  The trick (as I have adequately demonstrated with my own children) is to get them watching the boy and his serpent buddy BEFORE the likes of ""Dexter"", ""Cow and Chicken"", and ""Johnny Bravo"" pop onto the scene--In other words, be proactive in dodging the idiotic nonsense often seen on ""Cartoon Network"" (which provides a few good cartoons as well).  My kids can't stand the stinking stuff because they were originally exposed to intellectual types such as Baby Huey,  Porky Pig, and of course the mild mannered creations of Tex Avery and Bob (no relation to Jed) Clampett.  Colorful character names such as ""Captain Huffenpuff"" and ""Dishonest John"" are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of early childhood development.  Clampett's ""Special Edition"" production contains some Titanic episodes that really rock the boat!  This  DVD is truly heaven sent when one considers its overall superior quality, historical insight, and  gossipy tidbits about the creator (of our subjects at hand!).  Super duper, double deluxe, plain old ordinary 1950's entertainment and fun!

The cartoon that deals with processing a TV show and impressing ""Networkus Sponsorus"" is particularly hilarious. Though I appreciate all the included extras about Bob Clampett, this is a little pricey for only a dozen cartoons.  Season 2 (with only 11 or 12 more cartoons) is really overpriced, out of a lot of people's reach.  This was on early evening TV the same time the Flintstones was being shown on alternate nights.

There may be a slight delay in getting your DVD from this small family-owned operation, but by all means, do order Volume 1 and request that they do a new run of Volume 2.  Volume 1 has a copyright date of and 2011.

Volume 1 has about 4 hours of material.  There are 12 actual cartoons:  ""Beany Meets the Monstrous Monster;"" ""So What and the Seven Whatnots;"" Beany and the Boo Birds;"" ""Super-Cecil;"" ""The Spots Off a Leopard;"" ""Dirty Pool;"" ""There's No Such Thing as a Sea Serpent;"" and what in this reviewer's opinion are the best of the best:  ""DJ the DJ (exposes the truth about the recording industry);"" ""Beanyland"" (great parody of Disneyland, right down to the plugs for it on the Disney TV show, with the Captain as Tinkerbell); ""Cecil Meets the Singing Dinasor"", ""Wild Man of Wildsville"" and ""The Mad Isle of Madhattan"" (written by Stan Freberg, himself an ad man).  The bumpers also feature the Wild Man himself, Go Man Van Gogh.  Also included are a number of episodes of ""Time for Beany,"" the original 15-minute puppet show that aired daily.  (Although the grotesque puppets don't have the charm of their animated counterparts, the writing is very funny, including a fond tribute to President Harry Truman, who plays the ""Missouri Waltz"" on the piano before jiving with Cecil on ""Ragmop.""  (That song was written by Wills and Anderson in 1949 but became Cecil's hit as well.)  The puppet episodes are worth listening to in their own right, as they do feature the tremendous talents of Stan Freberg and Daws Butler (who would also voice Yogi the smarter-than-the-average-Bear for H-B).  The rest of the volume consists of rare audio interviews with Bob Clampett, films (including a silent he directed as a teenager), photographs including with many celebrities of the day, and a number of ""lost"" works and a proposed suggestively autobiographical cartoon starring Cecil that never made it past the storyboard stage.  This is great stuff, especially for fans of the Golden Age of Animation.  Who knew that the first Disney collectibles (Mickey and Donald stuffed toys) were actually produced by Bob Clampett's aunt (he helped out with the stuffing chores)?  Obviously, one would want more of the cartoon episodes, and my best guess is that perhaps not enough of the painstaking digital remastering had been completed yet.

I would like to add a note on the voices.  It's well-known that there was a lot of cross-pollination going on in terms of animators and their ideas, with Disney animators moonlighting at smaller studios and everyone knowing what everyone else was doing around town, and everybody who wasn't Disney at least starting out by imitating the output of the House of Mouse.  (One of the cartoons on this DVD, featuring a Cecil-like dinosaur named Snorky, seems to owe as much to the ""Rite of Spring"" sequence from ""Fantasia"" as it does to ""The Lost World,"" the silent film that actually served as the inspiration for Cecil.)  Similarly, voice talent would moonlight from one studio to another, whether they had a contract or not.  Mel Blanc's contract with Warner Brothers specified that only he would be listed in the credits, but it was well-known (and thankfully acknowledged today) that Stan Freberg created many great voices, including Junyer Bear.  For the ""Time for Beany"" episodes, Stan Freberg is clearly doing DJ, but for the cartoons, it's Walker Edmiston (or Irv Shoemaker).  To my ear, though, DJ sounds a lot like Snidely Whiplash, who was Rocky and Bullwinkle's nemesis voiced by Hans Conreid (who also did Captain Hook, himself apparently a visual caricature of Basil Rathbone).  DJ and Snidely certainly looked similar and were being animated at the same time - they were both derived from the traditional mustachioed, top-hatted and black-caped villain of traditional melodrama from the 19th century, for all that Clampett's old boss from WB, an actually nice guy named Larry Miller, provided a more immediate visual inspiration.  (Although Larry actually ended up working on the character as an animator, he never realized it was a caricature of him, any more than Leon Schlesinger ever realized that Porky was a caricature of him).  (One interesting tidbit from the DVD is that Captain Huffenpuff was inspired by Wallace Beery in a silent movie playing a sea captain created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.)  The Singing Dinasor actually seems to have been voiced by 40's band vocalist-turned-TV celebrity Dinah Shore, and Cecil actually says, ""She sounds just like Dinah Shore, one of my favorite TV personalities.""  I would guess that this was Clampett's way of acknowledging this guest appearance.

I'm certainly hoping one of the animation historians will come out with a volume on the brilliant career of Bob Clampett.  His work at Warner Brothers is well-represented on DVD sets available on Amazon, but you almost have to sail the Leakin' Lena into uncharted waters to get hold of the Beany cartoons.
