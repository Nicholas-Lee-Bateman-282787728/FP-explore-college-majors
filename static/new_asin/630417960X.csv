7867284,4,630417960X,"I was intrigued by this episode because it so reminds me of all the people addicted to their digital devices.  I love technology, but this story made me think of the potential addiction of media devices that excludes everyone except the one person and their media toy.  It was a fantastic story, yet it made me think.",1379548800,,317,4.543859649122807
7867285,5,630417960X,"This is my favourite ""Wesley"" episode. I didn't hate the character as some do, but I wasn't fond of him. I also thought Lefler was cute when this came out.

I don't know how this would have worked on Geordi though-a blind man

Also, it would have been interesting to see how they got Worf to play (it doesn't really seem like his ""thing""). Although I suppose the counselor may have gotten him to. Or even Picard, with a playful, ""I order you to take some time off, Mr. Worf! Relax-play a game""

The one person who I am really surprised at was Guinan. Her character would really seem to have been a person to have been hard to get to play. (Maybe Whoopi Goldberg was unavailable for this episode, or maybe it would have been hard to have her do any useful activity in stopping the plot)

Either way, the episode was fun-I remember watching it fondly as a teen in the early 90s",1286841600,,875,4.284848484848485
7867286,5,630417960X,"This engrossing episode involved an evil electronic device that lured almost everyone on the Enterprise into a state of addicted, malleable euphoria.  ALMOST everyone, that is, except for Wesly Crusher, who was visiting from Starfleet Academy.
Wesley noticed the crew behaving strangely, analyed the device, located the knocked-out Data and determined how to reactivate him, then arranged for same to appear just at the right moment and de-hypnotize the command staff -- which saved not only the Enterprise itself, but (per instructions being executed) several star bases, the Academy and, pretty much, the entire Federation.
Wesley, at this point, having bravely and cleverly prevented enslavement of the whole civilized universe, deserved nothing less than to be promoted to full starship captain... but no, he just kissed Ashley Judd goodbye and went back to school.  It was a grave injustice, and I have never been more depressed after watching a Star Trek episode.  Captain Crusher -- alas.",1071532800,2,995,5.365384615384615
7867287,5,630417960X,"This ST:TNG episode was full of mystery and fun, and also had a little hint of conspiracy to it.  It all starts when Commander Riker is shown a game by a woman he likes, and then he quickly pursuades the crew to try it, and then it eventually leads to the conspiracy, where a chase for Wesley Crusher begins.  What happens then is what you'll just want to find out yourself, so I hope you get this show!",1038787200,,403,4.153846153846154
7867288,5,630417960X,"My son's favorite episode is ""Remember Me"", which I admit is AWESOME. But this one, ""The Game"", is the one that fascinates me the most.
It seemed to be an innocent game. Riker was introduced to it by one of his female companions while on leave. It was HIGHLY addictive. He brought it back on board ship, had it replicated, and the game caught on like wild fire! EVERYONE was hooked! They played the game even while they worked. Only Wesley Crusher and one other female friend of his were wary. They realized the addictive game was not natural.
Wesley Crusher vs the entire ship. Talk about bad odds! But this nimble and intellegent teenager amazed me. To tell more would spoil it.
Considering only 3 episodes stand out for me (""True Q"", ""Remember Me"", and ""The Game""), I cannot help but post this in hopes that someone else will fall in love with these perticular 3.",1002585600,6,866,4.522292993630574
