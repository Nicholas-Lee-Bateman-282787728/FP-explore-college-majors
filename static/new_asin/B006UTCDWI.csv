5020331,1,B006UTCDWI,"SPOILER ALERT!

Wow.  I saw someone had given this film a 1 star rating and thought to myself, self, it can't be THAT bad!

I was wrong.  It is.

There was some promise but it seemed as if all character interactions were base on something that happened without the viewers knowledge.  Not one conversation truly made any sense.  It's as if each scene was divorced from the rest of the movie, and furthermore, not concerned with conveying any coherent message to the viewer.

A man is a drunk; a kid runs away from home; a man sales bootleg whisky; he also sales damaged boats; his partner want to stop selling damaged boats; a woman wants to start dating again; the drunk man wants to get sober; a boy wants a boat; a kid returns home.",1343606400,,735,4.392592592592592

8504799,5,B006UTCDWI,"I really liked this film. It's not a heavy message movie, and if you prefer explosions, superheroes, and car chases, this movie isn't for you. But if you like gentle, heartfelt stories, this move is great!",1496707200,,205,4.722222222222222
8504800,3,B006UTCDWI,i bought it to see Dana Delany but she disappears from the movie very early in never to return. Disappointing.,1429920000,,110,4.55
8504801,2,B006UTCDWI,"That's right, they filmed this catastrophe down the street from my house. No joke. 6 houses away. Right here in Morton Grove, IL (Harrison Ford is from here...just saying)

I was driving home and saw a bunch of lights and people standing around. I thought Close Encounters was finally happening. So me and a few friends headed towards this mothership only to find it was not a mothership but a film crew and a different kind of ship...a Drunkboat.

We asked what was going on. Some guy, who I like to assume was the gaffer, key grip or best boy (whatever that hell that is) told us they were shooting a movie. The crew and director were cool though. They said we could hang around as long as we wanted and watch them film just keep quiet and don't be in the shot. We then stood there for an hour watching the one and only John Malkovich walk around carrying 2 chickens they purchased from the Produce World down the street from me, delivering lines and -dare I say it- BEING JOHN MALKOVICH!

Mind you this was late at night. Like midnight and after. They finished for the day and started to put stuff away so we asked who else was in the movie and the title of it. They told us John Goodman and Drunkboat. So we left thinking, ""Damn both those guys in a movie? And a boat? I don't know wtf was going on there but it'll probably be good.""

And we never heard anything again...UNTIL 2012. Oh BTW the filming was done in 2006.

Yes 6 long years later, recently let go from my job with nothing to do, flipping through amazon instant video one night and what do I come across? This. Finally, this direct to DVD ""masterpiece"" was only $3.99 away from being streamed on my ps3 to my 52 inch screen of visual splendor. I couldn't believe it. I'd googled this before and found near nothing. I was sure it was tucked in a vault somewhere never to be seen or heard of ever. I thought I had a better chance of finding the holy grail before I would ever find this sublime piece of cinema.

My smartphone couldn't dial my friends fast enough to put together a viewing of this ""cinematic achievement."" Within a matter of minutes the gang that was with me that night we actually saw movie magic being made right before our eyes was in front of my TV ready to go. A couple of clicks and we were on our way...

TO ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.

I'll save you 98 minutes. John Malkovich is a drunk, he hasn't seen his family in forever. He finally returns. His nephew wants to buy a boat and sail away. The boat is purchased but its a piece of s***. Everyone is happy in the end. That's it.

Seriously so much of this movie was just horrid. I've seen porn with more developed plots than this film. Though those pornos were severely lacking in Malkovich they did make up for it with ample amounts of boobs.

There were so many whys that were never answered in this film. This film is literally so bad that after filming wrapped the house they used in the movie was immediately torn down, probably to cover up any evidence of this movie ever existing.

I did laugh at a few parts. John Goodman had a few good lines and Malkovich had some funny lines as well. The weird kid (yea there's a weird kid) has his moments. I especially laughed at the mention of Produce World. It was kind cool to see these big name actors on the streets by my house and sitting in the field I drive past every day. But aside from that aspect this truly is a train wreck.

Also, living in Chicago I'll tell you this. When he went to the boat yard to check out the boat NO ONE IS TAKING 1 BUS FROM MORTON GROVE TO THAT PART OF CITY! You would have had to take soooo many buses! It's called the L. You'd have been there faster. And if I remember right I'm pretty sure that street in the city was wrong. I think I remember saying that. You'll have to forgive me as I've tried to strike any memory of this movie from my mind.

So there you have it. It sucks. And I was literally there while that made it. Boom.",1404950400,,3973,4.211842105263158
8504802,2,B006UTCDWI,"Uneven performances with a story that makes you go meh at times.  However, if you are a John Goodman fan it's worth it to watch it just for him.  He shines as a scumbag in this film, and you could tell he relished the role. It's also great to watch him act circles around Jim Ortlieb who is his business partner in the film.",1369699200,,324,4.046875
8504803,1,B006UTCDWI,BAD BAD BAD. This was a very bad movie one of the worst I have ever seen. BAD BAD BAD,1354320000,,85,3.3
8504804,5,B006UTCDWI,"Loved the movie, and so pleased that I did not read reviews prior to watching!  If you are looking for James Bond action/thrills entertainment, go elsewhere!  Drunkboat provides peeks into lives whose stories, choices, and yearnings are a composite part, indeed, of what makes the world go round!  Thought provoking, this movie ably set a tone that was consistent and superbly portrayed by the actors.",1352505600,,401,5.138461538461539

Critics in general didn't like it because it's a feel good film with great actors that relates a simple family story about growing up. The dialogue is wonderfully Mamet-like and makes the film move slowly, carefully and lovingly. Well done!",1351555200,4,398,7.48936170212766

8504807,4,B006UTCDWI,"(I have NOT seen this movie yet, but I can only speculate on the rating.) If there's no point to the story, then that's probably intentional. There no point to mentioning something that's 'boring!;' keep in mind there's if something's not obvious to someone's attention, then that something's not perceived well.",1345939200,,312,5.137254901960785
