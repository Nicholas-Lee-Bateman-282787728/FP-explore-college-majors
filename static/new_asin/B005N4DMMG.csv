4842207,5,B005N4DMMG,"Having read Atlas Shrugged twice in the past 30 years, I was concerned the movie might take liberties with Ayn Rand's plot and characters. How often have you read a great novel only to be disappointed with the movie version? Atlas Shrugged Part 1 was true to the book and riveting. The actors accurately portrayed Rand's characters and a plot derived over fifty years ago is very timely today ... scarily so. I hope Atlas Shrugged parts 2 and 3 show up in the theater.",1305331200,35,468,4.517647058823529

4842209,5,B005N4DMMG,The relevance of Atlas Shrugged is Rand's ability to depict the motives of those who would govern the rest of us; a must read if you want to understand the world we now find ourselves.

4842210,5,B005N4DMMG,"My wife and I watched this film and loved it. I had read the book twice, my wife never. At the end of the movie something happened I have never seen before, everyone (yes I mean EVERYone) stood up and started to applaude. The movie was true to the book and was a rush from the 1st scene. The only disappointment is waiting for the sequels because every moment of the film felt like it was building to a crescendo.",1304985600,38,413,4.175
4842211,5,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged Part 1 hints at a greater message to be revealed.  It is fast paced, so keep alert when watching! It may be hard for someone unfamiliar with Rand's book to follow, but it will entertain you whether you've read the book or not.  Some of the action on screen is frighteningly like events that we see reported in the news today.  The producers included some subtle touches here and there that are fun to look for (the dollar sign on the cigarette that the missing philosopher is smoking). See it more than once if you can, the depth of detail blossoms on additional viewings. The message is apparently completely lost on the critics. It is an uplifting message, empowering the individual and encouraging growth, achievement and personal happiness, out of which generosity and wealth grow. Don't believe what critics say about this movie or about the book, both are more than worth a look or six.",1304726400,175,907,4.727848101265823
4842212,5,B005N4DMMG,"Truncated as any adaptation of a 1100 page book would be, the vital elements are all there and the performances were exceptional to a person.",1304726400,21,141,4.68
4842213,2,B005N4DMMG,"On the third Saturday evening after Atlas Shrugged was first released in theaters, I attended a local objectivism society meeting wherein the agenda was to evaluate the film.

The method was eminently logical.  Part I of the film covers the first (of three) sections of the book.  In the book, each Part consists of ten chapters.  For the meeting, ten reviewers, each taking one chapter, were assigned the following tasks:

1)  Determine, for your chapter, what three major plot components are ""must-sees"" for the movie -- what three instances or events or messages are absolutlely vital, for the film to accurately portray the book.

2)  Ascertain whether the film did present those three plot components.

The evaluation -- the film vis-a-vis the book, by people well steeped in the letter and spirit of the book -- was dismal.  And, per their eminently qualified reasoning, was perfectly valid.  As an adaptation of the novel, the movie falls far short of good.

One example:  In the book, when Francisco first met Rearden at the latter's anniversary party, Francisco initiated a somewhat intense conversation, a presentation totally contrary to his ""playboy"" practices.  It was one of many pivotal conversations in the book, and it first showcased the story's mystery -- Francisco warning Rearden, in effect, not to believe everything he was seeing.  And after the conversation, Rearden was impressed, and some seeds of doubt had been planted.

But in the film, that conversation took less than a minute, covered nothing complex or profound, and one was left with the impression that Rearden was not impressed.

The group's analysis consistently revealed such weaknesses for every chapter in the book's first section.  The movie is simply not a good adaptation.

Very familiar with the book, I enjoyed the movie, but I agree it was not nearly as good as it could have been.  Considering the quality of the source, the movie is a failure.

Having read the book, I wanted to see the film.  But, would someone who'd never read the book, upon seeing the movie, WANT to read it?  I strongly suspect not.",1304726400,27,2102,4.959885386819484
4842214,4,B005N4DMMG,"(This is the review I posted for the soundtrack.)

I just saw the film yesterday. All the critics who rated it 1-star are intellectually dishonest, using their hatred of the movie's ideas as an excuse to trash a well-done -- though, of course, not perfect -- film. (I'm thinking specifically of Roger Ebert who couldn't even correctly incapsulate Objectivism's main idea: that we each own our own life and therefore get to decide how our lives will -- or will not -- be used.)

The soundtrack does a good job of capturing the spirit of the film and its characters.

I hope the two sequels eventually get made. I was left with wanting more.",1304640000,166,639,4.587719298245614
4842215,4,B005N4DMMG,"I read the book; the narrative in the book is very in-depth through the entire story. A wonderful creation by the author. When I saw the movie, I found it to be very fast moving, and if I had not read the book, I might have been lost and would not have known the idea of the author. Of course, a lot of details were left out, and therefore, I found something lacking by the end of the movie.",1304640000,11,391,3.962025316455696
4842216,5,B005N4DMMG,"This movie is being continuously slammed by critics and for obvious reasons. It's not because the movie is bad, quite the contrary, but because the movie has a strong message of being both ""politically & economically conservative"" and Hollywood producers despise that message.

Thus, Hollywood wouldn't go near this project. This movie was not hugely promoted and the movie actually had to be financed by many political groups just to have it made [but on a shoe-string budget of only $15 million - a lot less than would go into any other Hollywood epic] and it only has grossed around $3 million because it is not in very many cinemas. Hopefull, enough money willbe raised to make Parts II and III to complete the story.

This movie was destined to be ""box office poison"" but I hope it gets better reception when it comes to DVD. I will not give away any of the plot here or talk about specific characters. This review is to explain the concept of this movie, which was a wonderful adaptation of the novel it's based on.

""Atlas Shrugged - Part I"" is also misunderstood by many people who trash it. It is based on author/philospher Ayn Rand's sprawling 1957 epic novel ""Atlas Shrugged"" which is divided into 3 parts. This movie covers only the first part of that novel [336 pages out of 1168 pages] and so viewers must understand that this is not a complete story like, for example, the 3 ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Although there were 3 ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, each movie covered an entire book/story. The same can be said about the Episodes 1,2, and 3 of ""Star Wars"" because although they were divided into so-called ""episodes,"" each episode actually told a completed story. With this movie, that is not the case.

Therefore, this movie should be commended for that original concept alone. One has seen this concept in television via the miniseries but never in the cinema and, ironically, NBC was the only network that thought of adapting Atlas Shrugged for a tv miniseries in the 1970s [they had Godfather producer Albert Ruddy at the helm] but decided not to go ahead with it because of its unpopular subject matter.

So why all of the negative fuss about this movie?

Basically because of its premise: In the near future [2016 - 2017], the U.S. economy is a huge disaster due to financial mis-management by big national government [what else is new?] but the govt. covers its hide by blaming big business and they begin to ""put the squeeze"" to business people by passing laws prohibiting them to prosper greatly and improve the economy in order to fool the public into thinking big govt. is solving the problem when in fact big govt. is the problem.

So, these productive members of society [whom ""Atlas"" - the Greek God who held the world on his shoulders - symbolizes] decide to show the manipulated public that big govt. is the real enemy of the public instead of themselves. They do this in a very creative and efficient way; they ""go on strike""[Atlas shrugs and the world collapses into destruction] by closing their businesses and leaving public life. Where do they go? They are led by a mysterious man named John Galt to a place called ""Atlantis"" where they can live among and be allowed to be productive members of society without any govt. infringement. There is govt. there but only a much smaller necessary govt. that does not thrive on deceiving and manipulating the public for its own monetary gain while society suffers. What happens to society when it's deprived of its productive members and only has the U.S. govt. to rely on? Society gets 100 times worse than it already is. That's what Atlas Shrugged is all about.

This may be difficult for someone to grasp who is not familiar with neither the book nor the economic philosophy promoted here. It is a novel / movie of ""Fiction"" so people who slam the movie for being ridiculous must remember that this book promotes an economic Utopian society and does not focus on realism.

This concept cannot be shown in a 2-hour movie so fans await Part II [which will cover pages 337-697] and Part III [which will cover the final part of the book; pages 698-1168].

Don't expect action scenes. This movie is 100% politically economic and consists mostly of business meetings, media and govt. manipulation, betrayal, and mystery.

This movie is not for everyone. It will attract ""Objectivists"" - people who follow author Ayn Rand's philosophy and peope who favor conservative economic methods [ala Milton Friedman] and a smaller federal government.

This movie will repel any government workers [from public school teachers in local government to congress members], union organizers, and bleeding-hearts who believe the only way to get rid of povery is to always subsidize poor people with taxpayers' money so they have no incentive to work and be productive members of society.

Personally,  I am not an ""objectivist"" because I believe in God, I don't believe that selfishness is a virtue, and I believe that some minor taxation is necessary in order for a complex society to properly function.  However, this doesn't prevent me from enjoying the works of Ayn Rand, enjoying her conversations regarding her own philosophy of ""objectivism,"" or recognizing that ""Atlas Shrugged - Part I"" is a wonderful and significant movie with important economic, political, and social messages just like the wonderful novel it is based upon.",1304640000,632,5397,4.819459459459459

4842220,1,B005N4DMMG,"Wow this is terrible. If you've read the book then MAYBE you'll slightly enjoy this. Maybe. Even then it's pretty doubtful.
If you've read Atlas Shrugged then you know the story is massive and what they did for the movies was to take key scenes out of the book and string them together to make the movie. What that means is we get a couple dozen key scenes with no real story to link them together. We aren't given any real reason to care about the people in the story. About 75% of the way through when Rearden's wife is making fun of her bracelet I started to care a little bit about Dagney and Rearden but that was about it. Also the original story is set in the 1930's when rail travel was the norm but we were just starting to get personal aircraft and centers around the rail, coal, oil industries. For whatever reason instead of making the movie actually set in that era (budgetary constraints?) they set it in the current era. However to force rail travel to pertinent they created an economic calamity and oil shortage. In short - what a hot mess. To be fair however I'm sure that everyone involved did their very best to bring this story to the big screen and that doing so required cutting a tremendous amount of story, budget, etc.",1515542400,2,1243,4.3852813852813854

A guy has developed a new lighter/stronger steel and a female railroad tycoon purchases the metal. Of course there are concerns and even possible refusal to use the tracks.

THEN, the government goes into trust busting mode (like Teddy Roosevelt). Then, a shadowy guy (Freddy Krueger?) shows up at peoples' homes late at night and then they are gone-to join 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' perhaps? A scene of passion, not explicit.

4842233,4,B005N4DMMG,"As an avid fan of Ayn Rand, I was really excited to watch this movie.  I know that movies rarely contain the same magic of the books, but I had hope.  I was disappointed.  I get that the filmmakers tried to make the film more relevant by bringing it closer to current time, but I think it missed the mark.  The book is a commentary of the ridiculous and obtrusive society that the prime movers need to ""fight"" to succeed in their individual best self.  Dagny Taggart, the protagonist, is true to her self and her moral code.  She is brilliantly played by Taylor Shilling, hence the 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to focus on her love triangle and scenery shots, while superficially grazing the theme of the book.  I can see how someone who only sees the movie would be confused about the story line.  I really hate the character of John Galt in this.  I hate that the filmmakers chose to show him talking to the other prime movers and asking them to go away with him to Atlantis.  The book is neatly divided into 3 sections, and John Galt isn't introduced until the 3rd part, so I wonder why the filmmakers chose to introduce John Galt in the first of three movies, instead of remaining consistent with the author's vision.  Unfortunately, I feel like it cheapens the plot.
I watched the second only hoping that it would get better.  It got worse.  I couldn't bring myself to watch the third.",1499817600,,1407,4.488188976377953
4842234,3,B005N4DMMG,"The filmmakers shot themselves in the foot at the outset by setting the story in 2016. To make that work required way too much exposition to explain why on Earth rail travel would be viable --even crucial --in modern times. Telling this story using a visual medium (as opposed to a book) is a difficult enough task anyway, considering so much of the content takes place in the characters' minds. Taylor Schilling delivers a solid performance but the rest of the film stagnates quickly. Too bad as it's a great book.",1497916800,,515,4.670329670329671

4842247,2,B005N4DMMG,"I am not a big fan of Ayn Rand or objectivism, etc, but I see some ideas in there I like. I lean Libertarian, but do not agree that everything the government touches is ruined. So I guess I'm just saying I did not have a huge emotional investment riding on the success or failure of this film. It was just a movie to me.

It's a bad movie. The message is hamfisted at times. The acting is very uneven, and probably suffers all the more from poor direction and editing. The dialogue is erratic... actors seem to get abruptly forceful and angry with little reason and to little effect. The editing, sets, and cinematography are unimaginative. The soundtrack is frequently a liability. If you look at a run-of-the-mill TV show like Blacklist, this film does not even approach it on any level... it would be VERY unremarkable as a made for TV movie. The attempts it makes to inspire awe and excitement or create atmosphere fall flat. I would expect that most of these are budget issues, as it takes quite an effort to make a film like this, and I have to assume that people knew what they were doing.

I have seen worse films, for sure, but never one this bad with so many good reviews. At least there was a basic story that held together. I was able to finish it, and it was mercifully short. I would never recommend this film, but I actually want to watch the next one just to see if they took it up a notch.",1491091200,5,1406,4.30188679245283
4842248,5,B005N4DMMG,"I admire Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged; its writing style and technology descriptions are dated but the self-motivational message rings true. When I learned that the novel had inspired a three-film series (released 2011, 2012 and 2015 respectively), I had to watch the films.

The films somewhat update the novel: Terrorism has disrupted global energy supplies, weakening infrastructure until rail transport is the only reliable transport. But government interference and decayed infrastructure hinder railroad operations even as reliance upon the railroads increases. Simultaneously, society's industrial giants (e.g., major corporation CEOs) are vanishing, often leaving behind a cryptic message: Who is John Galt? The first film takes the viewer through the disappearance of a Colorado energy magnate, a man whose business was supposed to finance railroad continued operations. The second film takes the viewer to John Galt's threshold.

Ayn Rand's original novel is written darkly, signifying industrial society's collapse. The updated film series depicts societal unrest and poverty instead of darkness, and the films highlight Western beautiful vistas, signifying the independent spirit of the Western United States. Ayn Rand's original novel is a testament to freeing capitalism from government interference (socialism and communism), and the film series continues this theme. I somewhat discount the pro-capitalism theme (both capitalism and government are guilty of excesses). I view the novel and this film series as celebrating engineers and problem-solvers' societal contributions while depicting the envy and interference that successful engineers and problem-solvers routinely face. And in the end we all make our own Atlantis.

Apparently there were some financial challenges making the film series: character actors sometimes change between films. But the screenplay updates Ayn Rand's original premise, the films' events and characters are well-presented, and the cinematography is impressive. The film series' updated depiction IMO is thoroughly enjoyable; my only regret is that the film series omits an Ayn Rand memorable quotation: ""There are sins of commission, and there are sins of omission."" I highly recommend the Atlas Shrugged film series to engineers and to other problem-solvers.",1489708800,,2311,5.892537313432836
4842249,4,B005N4DMMG,"I'm giving this boring and choppy film 2 stars more than I should, because of the lead actress, Taylor Schilling.  The film tries to unfold the long Ayn Rand narrative about individualism vs. government domination in the early 20th century.  The protagonist, Henry Rearden, is the ""heroic"" figure who wrenches his company to dominance.  Dagny Taggart, played by Schilling, is the polished, determined savior of her company. Shilling gives this character the class, glamour, and cool sensuality needed to provide a credible foil to ruthless Rearden.  The film comes alive when she's in a scene.  She's a luminous presence whose beauty and appeal command attention.  She carries the film, which otherwise suffers from tedious speeches and strange visual shots of trains moving to and fro.  One could wonder if, had she been cast as Dagny Taggert in the subsequent 2 film portrayals of the remainder of the novel, the entire 3-part series would have been much better received.  In case you miss my enthusiasm for Taylor Schilling, I'm doing a study of her filmography, and ""Atlas Shrugged"" is her first major film role.

Part 3 not so well done.

The change out of so many actors was a bit off-putting, the flow was disjointed, and the writing was poor.

Negative reviews continue to pour in, but these are typically by those who are the same looters in real life as depicted in the book and movies.  Hollywood and Washington, D.C. hate the idea of Objectivism, the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.  Objectivism allows no one to have power over one's life and livelihood but oneself.  Rationality, rather than emotion, govern our actions under Objectivism.

4842373,3,B005N4DMMG,"I read the book, so I was hoping the movie wouldn't be too bad...  The story, predictably, took 3 movies to cover, and of course it had to be vastly simplified to fit, even so.  Several sub-plots were dropped entirely, but this is generally true in adapting a book to a movie.  They did cover the high points of the original story, while successfully adapting it to a more modern era.  The biggest problem I had with the 3-part movie adaptation was:  The cast was entirely different for each DVD!  It was very distracting and disconcerting to pop in part 2, then part 3, and take a few minutes to get used to the new actors.  So, continuity was completely broken.  I now appreciate the Lord of the Rings trilogy of movies, and the pains they took to avoid just this potential situation.  It kind of ruined the flow of what could have been a really good trilogy.",1471046400,2,861,4.39873417721519

I liked the first installment of this trilogy but the follow ups were pretty poor and pretty much ruined the effort imho.

There was no foundation for who Francisco was which takes away quite a bit of the dynamic of his relationship to Dagny. But I realize it's hard to compress everything into a short film.

I have just seen the first of the films, and I never finished the novel. The movie is well casted. Taylor Schilling does a good job as Dagney Taggart. The book is extremely complex. I know a lot of reviews trash the movie, but it's really not that bad, if you are interested in the subject matter. Ayn Rand is not everyone's cup of tea. I think some of Rand's ideas are kind of outrageous, so the film is a bit outrageous, but it's not bad as entertainment. It's philosophical. Films based on philosophy are hard to pull off.

While looking the movie up, he was delighted to find that there are two more movies that really complete the entire saga. He mentioned then that he felt like the story ended where there was more to it and was thrilled to see a listing for two more movies that carry the story forward and then complete it in a very satisfying way. If you like stories that make you think, you will love this movie, make sure to get the other two parts to complete the experience. Really makes you ponder on it's content for sure!.

4842762,3,B005N4DMMG,"For whatever reason, each installment of this trilogy has an entirely different cast, and I mean EVERYBODY! At least Eddie stays black throughout the series. For me, that really ruined the flow. It can be really annoying trying to figure out who's who at the start of each film. The third installment was much shorter than the previous two and there's a lot of voice over narration. Maybe this is a little nit-picky but whoever cast the actor portraying Francisco d'Anconia in the third film should be shot-he looks at least 10 years (probably closer to 20) older than Dagny, and as for being a playboy? Not in his wildest dreams.

Those who aren't converted will watch this movie with raised eyebrows the entire time.  Okay, its not a horrible movie.  I didn't hate my time watching it.  It was sort of like watching Battlefield Earth, a movie that's so ludicrous it becomes somewhat entertaining.

The biggest problem with the movie is that it bashes you over the head by portraying all of the libertarian characters in such a positive light and all of the liberal characters so negatively.  I came into this movie with an open minded point of view, but if you want to convert people like me, do it through the plot.  And the plot was so unbelievably unconvincing in what it was trying to teach me.  TBH, as someone who never read Ayn Rand, I really expected better.

Either the Ayn Rand books are very overrated, or this movie was not a good representation of them.  Not sure which.",1429315200,,1071,4.5025906735751295

4842769,2,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged Part 1
 The original book by Ayn Rand from 1957 successfully defied movie makers until 2011 when Atlas Shrugged Part 1 came out.  Even at that the book proved to be so powerful that it took three installments to cover the entire volume.  The fact that the films were made at all can be placed at the feet of John Aglialoro, a millionaire businessman.  He has been trying to get the film made since 1992.  Aglialoro is a persistant sort.  Rand would have been proud of him.
 Parts of the film reach out into Science Fiction.  One of the two major characters is a steel magnate who invents a form of steel that is 'twice as strong, half the weight and half the cost' of ordinary steel.  In science fiction we call such a material 'unobtainium'.  There is also a new kind of motor that the steel baron and the lady rail road boss are trying to track down that somehow converts air into power very cheaply.  But they don't have a grip on that technology by the end of the film.
 The steel baron, Hank Rearden, and the lady rail road boss, Dagny Taggart are skillfully played by Grant Bowler and Taylor Schilling respectively.  Schlling is just old enough (and a capable enough actress) that we can believe she has the juice to run a big business.  She is also more than pretty enough  for us to believe that the steel baron might fall for her.
 The direction by Paul Johansson is competent enough.  But Ross Berryman as cinematographer should have been fired after filming the first scenes.  The film is so dark as to be impenetrable, particularly early on.  Director let it stay that way, so maybe they had a plan, some sort of atmosphere idea perhaps, but it didn't work for me.  It just looked poorly filmed from my angle.
 As a movie this just isn't much entertainment.  It only makes points as political fodder, and perhaps pointless fodder as the only folks who went to see it were already committed to the ideas of self reliance and antipathy to the hard, irrational and remorseless hand of government in the first place.  In any case, it took in less than $5 million at the box office against a claimed $10 million budget.
 I admit to not reading the original book.  It must have been better crafted than the film.  Among its other flaws is the jagged, halting way that the story unfolds.  It lasted only one hour and 42 minutes which to me left plenty of time to fill in some of the gaps in the story line.  We know that Mrs. Steel Baron is a bitch but not why.  We know that Ms. Railroad had an unsuccessful love affair with the Mexican business tycoon, but not what happened between them.
 But as political theater it works fine.  The baddies are government officials, their toadies and bank rollers.  They have no morals but enormous power to do evil.  The heroes are driven individuals that want to make a place for themselves in the world and who in pursuit of that simple goal take the rest of us along for the ride.
 I will think of this as part 1 of a three part film and hope that the films as films get better.  For now, it is an exercise in preaching to the choir.
 Two saw blades for this darkly filmed, jaggedly written attempt at political propaganda.  PG-13.

I expected to see a big cast and a big budget movie, but that was not to be.  The acting was fine and the story interesting, but knowing the intention is to present the story in three parts can only hurt it's box office.  Hollywood wants to get all it can get out of you and this trilogy idea appeals more to the soap opera fans than those that wants to just enjoy a film with a beginning and end.  Remembering that the story was written in 1957 this futuristic novel taking place in 2016 was pretty close.  Government has run amok and the idea of making every one equal (whether they are talented or not) and every business equal (whether their work is good or bad) has become the rule of the land.  Success is being crushed by politicians in a spread the wealth idea and Political Correctness is dragging down the country with a socialistic/communistic slant.  Suddenly the best and the brightest are starting to disappear and no one knows where they are going, but as they vanish those left are having a difficult time handling the oppressive and hard problems that are arising.

4842845,4,B005N4DMMG,"It takes a lot of guts to try to make a movie out of this book---for several reasons. The first, of course, is the sheer length of the book, akin to War and Peace. The other, equally obvious, is that the philosophical and political message in the book/film is anathema to the leftist Politically Correct hyenas that infest Hollywood and the overall media.

Now as to the first film: many of the characters are excellent. Taylor Schilling is superb in coming across as a no-nonsense executive surrounded by mediocrities who are constantly sabotaging her. Grant Bowler is also good at being stiff upper lip as he, too, is surrounded by whining, evil mediocrities. His wife (can't remember the actress' name) is also good at coming across as a ball-busting bitch. There are a lot of good secondary character actors. There are some problems with the script, primarily in that it doesn't really drive home the message just how bad things are, a lot of crucial details are left out, and, that the problems are a worldwide phenomenon, as was the case in the book.

Now as to the second film: it was a shock to see the entire cast replaced. Taylor Schilling, howevever, was irreplaceable, yet she was and the film suffers as a result. Sometimes it seems as if the character actors are shouldering the film. In short, it is not as good as the first. It takes up after the Colorado oil fields are set on fire and ends when Dagny crashes her plane.

The third installment was bad, no getting around it. The cast in once again replaced and not even the character actors can hold up the film with a terrible script that wastes a lot of time in a love interest between Dagny and Galt.",1424649600,,1670,4.56

4842863,1,B005N4DMMG,"After watching the three movies and balancing that with the criticisms of Ayn Rand on YouTube. I came up with this abstract constant:
Facilitation/Resistance. Facilitation is all that promotes or helps a person, such as material and financial security provided by a parent, and Resistance is all that hinders a person, such as bullying, child abuse, poverty. Plug that into this abstract formula: Facilitation/Resistance x IndividualsPotential = Productivity. Communists would probably say we need government to make Resistance equall to all, and that is a nave pipe dream. Ayn Rand would say that the constant Facilitation/Resistance should be ignored in the formula. She would claim that Productivity is the proof that an individual had potential or not. Then she goes on to say that people who have met the proof should be venerated as gods among men. But this begs the question--didn't people give their worship to these men by means of giving them their money in trade for their productivity? Is Ayn Rand saying that people should give their mind and soul to another human being? I am sure there are plenty of little Napoleons working as managers in little worlds (like McDonalds and Millers Outpost) who would like to demand a godlike respect from the employees who they allowed to work there. When it comes to worship of men as gods, count me out. As far as advocating selfishness, I am not sure what planet people come from, but certainly it needs no more promotion on this planet. Hearing her thoughts on selfishness is like starting a dogma about why you should never quit eating, or sleeping, or peeing. So by all means, join a cult where someone gives you excuses to justify your selfishness and be venerated for it--or don't join, and be secure enough in yourself to embrace your selfishness.

Over 7 million copies of the book have been sold since it was published in 1957.  Sales reached half a million copies for 2009 alone. A must see.,1422489600,,268,4.583333333333333

4842889,2,B005N4DMMG,"With the multiple rave reviews, including those given to me by my friends - I was expecting too much from this film... which may explain why I never knew that this classic book was made into a film (let alone, a three part film).

The time I was watching I noticed that Part 1 had a ""Hallmark Films"" kind of film.  No disrespect to Hallmark Film lovers, but those who have watched anything on the Hallmark Channel know what I'm talking about.  I watch a lot films from overseas, many of which have the handicap of a limited pool of actors/actresses.  Based on US standards, taking into account our long history of cinema - the cast of Part 1 has that feel of ""last resort"" options in regards to actors/actresses.

The story-line was painfully slow, dragging on, to the point of exaggeration - almost as if the creators were trying to fluff up a one part film into three.  I found the film, and the acting, to be painful to watch, and after the pain subsides.... forgettable and regrettable (wasting my precious time).  I felt like I was watching a film that was made in the late 70s, early 80s... over-the-top and ""just too much"".

I watched the entire film, throughout the viewing, I found myself waiting for it to ""get to the point"" or ""get good"" - then all of a sudden it ends, and I'm wondering ""WTH??"".  Always wanting to give something a fair shake - I will force myself to watch the 2nd and 3rd parts of the trilogy to see if it comes together at the end... but I'm not expecting much.

It seems that there is a cult following of Rand's books, which may account for the bloated star rating (just Google ""atlas shrugged part 1"", see the ratings provided, from multiple sources and know that I am not blowing smoke about the quality of this film).  I call a spade a spade, and recommend that if you don't have time to read the actual book, to listen to an unabridged version of the text... you'll get a lot more out of a wonderful piece of literary history.",1422316800,2,1962,4.377410468319559

4842895,1,B005N4DMMG,"I watched the movie at a friend's house. I did not, and will not, purchase it.

The book is Ayn Rand's view of what happens when socialists/marxists/progressives, a.k.a., today's politically correct, controls the government. (Her views on religion are boring.) Those on the left consistently misinterpret Ayn Rand's views about selfishness, governmental intrusions, corporations, etc., which makes a re-reading and comparison of her future to today fascinating. Given my view of the book, I was really looking forward to watching the movie.

Man, what a downer. I was so distracted by the acting, the dialog, the sheer boring-ness of the entire project, I was unable to pay attention to whether or not the film-maker(s) paid heed to the central theme of the devastating effects of what today is called ""liberalism.""

You must be in the mindset that our government is too big and too powerful in order to appreciate the theme of this movie (and the book!). I'm glad the producers didn't try to cram the whole story into one DVD. Since the move keeps pretty close to the book's plot, the plot and its characters are too extensive to take in all at one time. Be sure to order Part 2 (and 3, when it's available) or you'll be left hanging! :-) I loved the book so the movie is a great refresher for us.",1420502400,,591,4.05982905982906

I think it was really going to go somewhere, but I was disappointed when it didn't receive the widespread appreciation could have. The actors themselves could have been better and turned it into an amazing film, but instead, we have a lot of characters we not only care about, but we barely understand.

Atlas Shrugged II just delves deeper into how the government begins to take over our lives.  I can't wait to see Atlas Shrugged III.,1416873600,,362,4.538461538461538

I also don't understand why the actors change for each character in each part of the series.  I really think these changes impact the continuity of the story.

4843169,1,B005N4DMMG,"""AYN RAND's timeless novel of courage and self-sacrifice comes to life...""

From the original description on the DVD release of this film...kind of sets the tone for what is...an ultra-mediocre representation of Rand's magnum opus. Based on the producers complete lack of understanding of Rand and her philosophy.

Just to be clear, Rand was most certainly not a fan of ""self-sacrifice"" - although I believe she would have said that if you love someone, and choose to give to them even if it means you have less...well that is no sacrifice. It speaks to the core of value achievement on this earth...but the fact that the producers of this film thought that self-sacrifice was the theme...um...until they were corrected...well...that says it all to me...

I am not quite sure what is scarier, the hatred directed at the novel for which this movie is based by people who have never read it, or the slathering, ridiculously positive reviews for what is such a poor attempt at bringing it to the screen.

In fact, Producer Aglialoro presented Rand's detractors with the ultimate gift...finally...an example that her characters truly are ""wooden"", with dialogue and story to boot. Many who see this film first, will never touch Ayn Rand's books.

Ayn Rand herself thought that if a movie version of Atlas was terrible, it would ""ruin her"". That's a fact. Well...this film and people like Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and other supposed Rand fans, who stand in stark opposition to her actual views...are most certainly assisting in the process.

Now please allow me to quote Ebert on this mess of a film:

""So OK. Let's say you know the novel, you agree with Ayn Rand, you're an objectivist or a libertarian, and you've been waiting eagerly for this movie. Man, are you going to get a letdown. It's not enough that a movie agree with you, in however an incoherent and murky fashion. It would help if it were like, you know, entertaining?""

I had the misfortune to sit through this film at the premiere...and to see many of Rand's detractors invited and present at the cocktail party and screening itself...David Kelley...Nathaniel Branden...and others who have spent years both expropriating and living off of her works, reputation and ideas while taking every given opportunity to excoriate her. I was not pleased.

The film itself is what you would expect from a man who even I was warned twenty years ago, ""didn't understand Rand's ideas"" by an associate of Peikoff's (Rand's heir). It misses the heroic spirit and representation of her values/ideas almost completely while maintaining their hollow shape to those taking a glance. Like that f-ing tree Willers was so upset about (for those who have read the book).

Our heroic individualist producer says of the 3rd film coming out soon, that he is looking to make this version ""something closer to the book."" What does that presuppose exactly? The second movie, Aglialoro says, was rushed so that it would be ready by October 2012, before Election Day.""

What a momo. Can you imagine Rand rushing her work to be ready for election day?

On how he doesn't care about making money with this movie...""I never thought the financials would be this bad, but it's not strictly a business transaction. This is the business of the heart."" - it certainly is.

Aglialoro on Rand's liberal views: ""I'd like to speak to the MSNBC crowd,"" he said. ""So much of what Ayn Rand believed was liberal -- gay rights, and she thought the drug policy was a total disaster. She hated the Vietnam War.""

Look, I loved Rand's work. But her personal opinions on many things, including gays take much to be desired - and despite the fact that many in her inner circle were gay (including her brother-in-law)...well...I believe her exact words were that she thought that the behavior was ""immoral"" and ""dizgusting"" (russian accent). Although certainly she did not think it should be illegal.

So perhaps Johnny wants to reconsider how to sell Rand to the ""left"". :)

At one point, Aglialoro claimed that he would not make a 2nd and 3rd film (thank god) and blamed Roger Ebert among others for its failure, for which Ebert replied ""Atlas Shrugged producer cancels Parts 2 and 3, blames critics, not his own lousy film."" lol

And while I disagree with Ebert's views on Rand, had this film been great - as it could have been - his comments would have been irrelevant. Or perhaps begrudgingly positive. Ebert was bang on when he said, ""I suspect only someone very familiar with Rand's 1957 novel could understand the film at all, and I doubt they will be happy with it.""

At the premier of the 2nd film, Aglialoro defended Rand's views based on what was best for the common good. I heard it and so did the people from ARI sitting near me - who seemed to be taking notes.

All in all, the 2 films I have seen so far were the result of mediocrity in action, and did come off like an 80's spoof of Dallas, except without heavyweight Hagman to carry anything.

The way to do this film properly, was to make an animated mini series...preferably with someone whose spirit matched Rands...like Leiji Matsumoto...but then it's never too late...I just need to wait a few years for all these guys to retire and die.",1397347200,2,5213,4.764705882352941

4843172,5,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged is an incredible prophecy into the United State's future.  The book was published in 1957 and shunned by all of the elites at the time.  Every review of the book was negative.  However, the readers had a different opinion.  Atlas Shrugged has sold more copies of the hard cover than any other book aside from the Holy Bible.  This is a powerful story about how Government intrudes into the lives of individuals changing a free society into a socialist society (and eventually a communist society).

With the power grabs in Washington D.C. taking place, the NSA spying on American citizens, socialized healthcare, greed being rewarded by bailouts with our money, debt that cannot ever be repaid, our land, the abuse of executive orders, resources and freedoms being handed over to the U.N and total control over the media, this book should be a mandatory read for every American citizen.  Short of that, we should all see this movie and then see part II.  Part III (the final installment) will be issued on July 4th, 2014.  That's what is contained as the storyline.

The Movie is very well done!  The acting, special effects and the direction are all top notch.  Part II gets even a little bit better.  I strongly suggest viewing part I for the foundation.

If you watch one movie this year, see Atlas Shrugged part I.  You will walk away with your eyes opened.

That Capitalism is the best hope for mankind to enjoy a better life. The government is shown to be the biggest parisite of living off people's success without contributing anything in return. Government is shown as getting in the way of efficientcy in running a railroad, creating new markets and making people's lives better by not allowing freedom of their citizens to enjoy the fruits of their labor. This results in making the captains of industry decide to drop out of society to join a secret society that allows them to enjoy their rewards from the risks they took to develop new ideas of markets and technology. The movie shows the current society grinding to a halt cause only the incompetents are left to run things.

Ayn Rand adherents may disagree, but I feel the producers have done a good job of presenting the story without incorporating story changes.

4843235,4,B005N4DMMG,"As a Rand enthusiast, I was both thrilled and apprehensive about the movie. It was difficult for me to imagine presenting the profound ideas so artfully elucidated in the book within the limits of a video experience. Other efforts along the same lines, translating great literary works into film (like Mitchell's 'Gone With the Wind' or Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings') set the bar pretty high. Even between those two, the film version of 'Gone With the Wind' was closer to the original than was 'The Lord of the Rings'. And those were not primarily novels of ideas as 'Atlas Shrugged' is. Effectively communicating philosophical archetypes requires a level of precision and coherence on the part of the teller, and a concomitant level of discernment and intelligence on the part of the audience, to which the movie format may not be most appropriate. However, one thing may not be all things to all people. The action of the story does work well at its own level and makes for compelling viewing. Deeper appreciation may depend on already being familiar with the original work, enabling one to fill in the gaps and make the ideological connections which give the story vivacity and relevance.",1388102400,,1195,4.891625615763547

This work is, supposedly, to be read or seen when looking into Ayn Rand and her ideas, but is quite a disappointment if expecting any mature and well presented thought.

4843257,4,B005N4DMMG,"It has been a while since I read ""Atlas Shrugged"", so the plot details have faded from memory a bit; however the most noticeable departure from the original story is that it was moved to the modern era - actually a few years in the future - 2016. The country is struggling from a collapsing infrastructure; unemployment is rampant; gas is $65 a gallon and the economy relies more and more on the rail system to move people as well as goods. Taggart Transcontinental Railways, run by the tough and smart Dagney Taggart is struggling to get the steel it needs to maintain and expand the railroads. Dagney partners with the enigmatic Hank Rearden to purchase a new kind of unproven steel, known as Rearden Steel, to expand one of her rail lines through Colorado.

The government interferes more and more with industry, seizing assets and IP, controlling wages and production output. Capitalism is turning into socialism, and powerful, successful captains of industry are disappearing - walking away from their businesses, sometimes destroying those businesses beforehand. One of those men was John Galt, and Dagney coins the phrase ""Who is John Galt"" and names her new rail line ""The John Galt"" Line.

Though much of the dialogue is as wooden as it was in the novel, the important roles are well cast with strong, believable performers, though none of the actors are A-List caliber. The sets and special effects are a peculiar mixture of ultra modern and vintage since the rail system hearkens back to a different era. This is a credible treatment of Ayn Rand's serious novel, which has been considered ""required reading"" for decades. After completing this first installment of a 3-part series, and I was left with a sense of anticipation for the next segment, which I will review separately.",1383955200,3,1789,4.900990099009901

4843261,4,B005N4DMMG,"I actually enjoyed watching this movie mostly because of the acting.  All the characters were well portrayed and the actors for the most part were unknowns to me.  My only complaints were that it didn't take place in the 1950s when the book was written.  The time is 2016.  I think it would've been great if the producers would've done it in the same period  to make it more authentic.  I also wish they could've done part 1 and part 2 at the same time.  There is a whole different cast in part 2 and it was made two years after this film.  Why was that?

Another problem with the movie was that it really didn't delve into the background of the major characters, mainly Dagny Taggart, Henry Reardon, and Francisco D'arcania.  Francisco is portrayed mainly as a playboy and someone lacking talent and responsibility, yet in the book there is a lot of great insights coming from Francisco.  Even Henry Reardon's character is much more complex in the book--very driven, focused, without a lot of emotion.  His feelings emerge slowly and his passions are brought out much later.

I feel this could've been a much better film and it should have been done in two parts with the same actors.  On the positive side, the filming and cinematography was well done.  The city scenes were dark and showed the characters in an almost stark environment. The train scenes were very picturesque and really brings out how the two characters Dagny Taggart and Hank Reardon come alive on the railway as they experience their first collaboration of Reardon's metals and Dagny's John Gault Line.

WHAT I LIKED: The beginning was very well done, I felt, with Henry Reardon's douchey family not appreciating what he does for them, nor trying to understand what it is that he loves. They are completely self-absorbed while thinking they hold a higher plane of thought, which is ironic because Reardon and the other heroes are much the same but they benefit society with what they do, despite merely doing it for themselves.

Another thing I liked was that the end of the movie is very strong, and actually makes you want to see Part 2, especially since the cast has some recognizable actors.

WHAT STUNK: There are several dramatic lines that just fall flat, twice from Dagny Taggart when she is concerned for the state of the world. You would think she was a robot concerned over the stupid humans, and the context brought me to laugh out loud both times. Henry Reardon's wife is made to seem like a cold witch, which she definitely is, but Reardon doesn't seem to do anything that encourages her to be any other way, which is obvious in the ""love making"" scene where she could have been a hole in the wall with the way he was humping her (and later Dagny Taggart), so it's no wonder she's not interested.

Lastly, there is a scene where Reardon goes to the railroad tracks and sees Taggart with some workers and he says, ""you look just as comfortable here as you do at your office.""

You will see things that parallel our current society with eerie similarity.

4843315,5,B005N4DMMG,"I just watched the first two parts of this story and they were great.  I look forward to Part III, the final part, which comes out July 2014.

I found it instructive that >700 of the ~1200 Amazon reviews were 4 or 5 stars, while ~150 were 1 or 2 stars.  Leaving aside the 100 ambivalent 3 star people, that makes ~150 haters to ~700 lovers.

I read all of the 1 & 2 star reviews.  Most of them devoted little text criticizing the films as movies.  Most of them wrote hatred of wealthy people and pretty much everyone else who has more than they do.  One hater argued that Atlas Shrugged is 25 years too late to be a relevant movie and Communism is dead anyway.

But, Atlas Shrugged is not about communism.  Ayn condemned the evil done to everyone by societies that constrain the creativity and productivity of individuals rather than liberate these virtues and reward the individual accomplishments they empower.  Ayn taught that every society which denigrates and penalizes its producers, while preaching fairness and common good, is already declining.  She warned that leaders who play to the insatiable appetites of society's takers seek to control society's individuals.  Ayn herself told Phil Donahue, ""Anyone who speaks of the common good is either the state, or wants to be the state.""

Atlas Shrugged has never been more pertinent.  Western Europe penalized its producers, rewarded its takers and went bankrupt.  America increasingly impedes and penalizes our producers, rewards takers and we are going bankrupt.  Our leaders blame our producers for the failure of these policies, then impede and penalize them more for things getting even worse.

Many haters praised student loans and ridiculed anyone who doesn't.  But more student loan money goes out every year and tuition just goes up to absorb it.  The same with healthcare.  Fifty years ago I had a successful lemonade stand.  Now even little towns punish kids for lemonade stands.  Many years ago, my friend in Holland told me he never worked overtime because the taxes got so high that his salary for those extra hours wasn't worth it.  An American friend told me the same thing last January.

Way too many people think we actually had Capitalism before the Great Recession and its failure caused the 2008 collapse.  What collapsed was Globalism + Socialism, not Capitalism.  Ayn teaches that we've not had real Capitalism since before WWI.  Too few of us know the difference and fewer still recognize the code words.  That ignorance is what the state and those who want to be the state use to play us for fools.  Many reviewers of all levels ridiculed one party or the other, but both parties are playing us for fools, and have for many decades.

These movies are very good and they will help.  Take heart that of ~1200 Amazon reviewers, >700 were 4 or 5 stars.  That means most of us read and liked the book and even still get it.  It means there's still hope.  But, hope alone won't save us.  Recommend these movies to others.  If you can, buy extra copies and share them widely.",1375488000,,3049,4.740952380952381

4843324,4,B005N4DMMG,"Back when the book was ""all"" we had, I had trouble getting into the story. I chafed under obvious anachronisms and thought nobody could ever translate the story and its underlying philosophy to the screen. I was wrong.  Yes, the story does evolve and is much more cohesive when reading further into the book or seeing Parts II (and III).  As for transcending anachronisms, I think the screen presentation solves the problems very well.

However, I believe you do need the entirety before taking a negative position to Part I.  In fairness though, you may not know of the sequel Part II or Part III. I didn't.  I know I felt as though I was left hanging after Part I by the loss of backstory and hunger to meet not only John Galt but the fullness of other characters.  I didn't know of the productions when they first came out, but you can bet I'll be looking for Part III and ""the movie"" if that is in the cards.

Ayn Rand was a script writer before she evolved into objectivist philosopher.  I admire the screenplays as presented so far in Parts I and II.  I think Ayn would have been proud to her work being handled so well.  I truly hope that John Galt's speech is as powerful on the screen as it is in the book.

It has the ability to capture the viewer's imagination and is easy to get emotionally involved in the story plot.  It provides a serious lesson on the extravagances of big government and the danger present in power hungry politicians and corporate moguls.  It is a warning from the past (mid-20th century) to those of us living today regarding what could happen when heavy government intervention and a few big unscrupulous corporations control the country.

Anyone with the ability to think for themselves should see the movies (as of this writing, Pt 3 has not been produced).

Take a couple of cartoon capitalists as realistic as The Joker and The Riddler, have them channel a messianic vision of conservatives and capitalists from the last time they were widely respected - the Eisenhower era - when Republican bona fides by the way still included a (long since abandoned) sense of noblesse oblige and responsibility to the community - and insinuate these baroque cartoon characters as one and the same as the soulless, fat bastard sociopaths of today; the ones who have utterly corrupted our democracy and perhaps even pulled off a coup d'etat.

This looney bin fantasy turns everything on its head. Scientists become the ones who refuse to deal in reality and accept facts, not the cynical exploiters who assert climate change is a hoax. Congress is portrayed as so corrupted by liberals that they help the powerless, wretched masses at any cost, in the process decimating the poor, helpless titans of industry who become so distraught at their persecution that they are forced to flee the earth to an ideal All-Fat-Bastard world of their own making (Belle Isle, MI?) in a dress rehearsal of The Rapture.

But the premise of the story is half bunk - overly symplified into a few smart people being stymied by unions and politicians... by people who want everyone to share in the wealth even if they deserve it or not.

The funny part of this movie is that though a lot of physical labor has to happen, you never see people actually doing the physical labor. And NEVER FORGET THE WORKERS. If they aren't paid a living wage with medical care, they will protest... which is exactly what happened in Ayn Rand's Russia... total rebellion. And that will eventually happen again in China and India.

The need for cheap labor is the basis of our present capitalistic system. BUT it's a delicate balance - hard work deserve a living wage. That is not asking for too much. Those who won't work can stand in lines at soup kitchens.

As far as government regulations... the US has had quite a few major economic catastrophes... NOT because of the people doing the work. But because of those who want something for nothing... and that is the people who love to play monopoly with other people's money with few rules. Canada has strict banking rules... and Canada has never had a banking collapse in its history... it had economic hard times during the US depression but their banks remain solid.

At the time the first film was released the actors were somewhat unknown although the film has a few recognizable character actors that have been seen in other movies. Overall this film is a good first film based on the book. The sets and props and sweeping scenery between destinations presented and convey well the era in which Ayn Rand was writing ...from then to a forward and modern perspective. I do remember thinking how the first film seemed a bit lackluster...but then saw it again and compared it to the second installment and recognize that on the fast pace shoestring budget they produced with the first one, the effort and effects were actually much better.

Grant Bowler and Taylor Schilling were well cast in this film. As was the actor who played her brother and the other character ""Mauch"" (cronyist) both of whom are missing from the second film and replaced with other actors as well. (Apparently, because the first film wasn't a huge success and no contracts had been signed to retain the actors they had to find new actors to do the 2nd film.)

The second movie loses momentum visually but does manage to stay on track (no pun intended) to the core message. But completely different performances and sets in the 2nd one make the movie hard to stop comparing. Quite frankly the acting in the first film had a better intensity to it than the second.

--The political aspect: Wow this is laughable. It is so over the top. It paints a one sided, negative spin on Unions, regulations, government, the poor and hard-laborers.

Preachy.  Ayn Rand was against Soviet Communism and had an obvious delusion about it becoming some sort of Third Column.  Then the whole thing collapses when Gorbachev says 'Don't shoot', effectively signaling to Europe that the USSR is over.  In it's wake, we have a decade of putrid civil wars, massive government corruption, and rise of Putin and his 'Chekists' (the 'Cheka' were Lenin's original secret police).  Well, that's the ticket good chap!  What relevance this sort of Cold War nonsense has in modern society is bunk, the total of this is about 25 years too late to even make a bit of difference.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional and doesn't understand the banking crisis and recession since 2008 is from one simple fact: the banks sold fake bonds that essentially bankrupted the economy when the stack of cards fell.  Obama had huge donations from these banks and hasn't done anything about them as a result, but he isn't Stalin, c'mon.

I think they did a credible job of catching both the philosophy and the intended atmosphere.  Characters were cast as Rand would have portrayed them, but it is extremely difficult to bring the whole story to the screen for the simple reason that it is so long, involved, and written by the author to be far deeper than a film can go.

Also, top CEOs are disappearing after sudden encounters with mysterious men in black. But a couple of far-sighted, common-sense manufacturing executives are diligently trying to liberate the country from corrupt sell-outs and their cronies in Washington. Among other things, they discover the designs for a revolutionary new engine that runs on atmospheric electricity but was somehow just left abandoned in the shell of a Wisconsin factory that went belly-up because it paid its employees according to their needs instead of their contributions.

Sound familiar?

I did my best to ignore the rather obvious agenda behind this film and simply watch it as a poli/eco/whatever drama. While it has some really fine cinematography and decent acting, ATLAS SHRUGGED is languid, fake, and, in the words of several other reviewers, just plain boring. The opening is quite compelling, and the story has some definite plot-layers; nevertheless, the layers simply don't make a whole lot of sense. None of the story is really resolved here in Part One, and after watching same, I don't even feel much enticed to see Part Two (but I might).",1370736000,3,1323,5.235849056603773

The actual audiences, regardless of their political ideology, loved it.  You will too.  Even if you're a hardcore lefty who sees ""big business"" as the root of all evil, you can agree that there is dysfunction at work in government, and that there are honorable people in industry.

4843428,4,B005N4DMMG,"Rand's huge blockbuster, controversial novel has finally come to the screen....at least about one third of the book has come to the screen.

The novel takes place sometime in the middle of the last century and deals with the collapse of society due to a continually oppressive, meddling, corrupt, statist government. Eventually all the producers go on strike and leave to live together in a mythical valley somewhere in Colorado. The leading character John Galt, is Rand's ideal person who ,like the rest of his associates, who like the mythical Atlas, are forced to carry the rest of the world on their shoulders and then are punished for their inventiveness, individualism and strengh of character. Rather than continue to submit to an increasingly oppresive government, they choose to leave their wretched countrymen and live in a valley in Colorado which cannot be seen from above....Remember this is a fantasy. John Galt and the Colorado episode is not seen until Part III.

The story is much more complex and magical than my description....You really need to read the book.

One of the problems with the movie is that the producers tried to make the movie realistic and set it in the 21st century...It's about the great days of railroading and steam power and it does not fit well into the current time. The novel is romantic and rather magical in nature and does not come accross all that well as it is depicted on screen. Spielberg could have made this a great movie, but alas, the movie's very conservative philiosohical theme would preclude the liberal Speilberg and most other Hollywood folks from touching the subject. This might partially explain the many bad reviews from the mostly liberal media crictics.

Besides the problems I mentioned above, it has some other issues in that it was produced independently at a fairly low cost and it features some actors I have seen before, but no great stars.

Taylor Schilling is very believable as Dagny, but the rest are variable in their portrayals of the other characters. That said, it is a pretty accurate rendition of Rand's novel and her philosophy of individualism and her reverence for the indiviual and the right to live one's life for one's own pleasure and not as a sacrificial lamb for the non producers of society or the state.

It's a good thing that the movie was made even if it is not ideal and it certainly deserves viewing. The producers deserve our thanks for their effort. Watch the movie and don't believe all the reviews; you might be surprised and think differently about yourself and the country in which you live.

Part II is available now and Part III is being filmed as I write.

Before viewing the movies I would first consider reading the book.",1367366400,,2731,4.82051282051282

4843432,1,B005N4DMMG,"I have to confess that I was very excited to sit down and watch this film at last. About halfway through Part One I found myself extremely bewildered as to the question of whether the producers actually ever read the book.

We come to expect a fair amount of artistic license when books get adapted to film. It's a part of the transferral process between written and visual media and a concession to tight time constraints. What makes this adaptation particularly bad is not only what they left out and kept in, but the genuinely awful characterization and casting of the main characters.

Beyond the poor casting there is the badly executed presentation of key scenes, to the point that what we are left with is a highly piecemeal presentation of Ayn Rand's philosophy and a fairly well gutted version of the story itself.

I do not consider myself a follower of Ayn Rand's philosophy by a very long stretch, but I do appreciate her tremendous achievements as a writer (especially considering that she did not even fully learn English until her 20's). From that simple aesthetic standpoint I have to say that this adaptation of her work for film has done her and her book a real disservice.",1367366400,5,1191,4.688995215311005
4843433,1,B005N4DMMG,"SPOILER ALERT: There may be a several references to this film that may spoil it for you if you really intend on purchasing the Blu-ray or DVD of this amateurish bit of filmmaking. That would be one.

Let me begin by saying that it's been roughly thirty years since I read Ayn Rand's magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, though I have returned to it and referenced it from time to time, especially some of the lengthier speeches. For me, Rand's novel has always worked much better as a serious and thoughtful political polemic warning America about the seduction and dangers of Marxism rather than as a novel in the same way that East of Eden or The Great Gatsby are novels. Most literary characters within a third-person, omniscient narrative typically don't speak incessantly for sixteen or more pages without at least taking a breath. Something that Rand's editor, the great Bennett Cerf pointed out to Rand and asked her to consider editing. To which Rand replied, ""Would you edit the Bible?!"" Thomas Jefferson had, of course, but that's another story.

That aside, the dark, dystopian America that Rand paints in Atlas Shrugged is all too recognizable in the nefarious shenanigans of the Obama administration, the Democrat Party, or evident in the recent union protests, and the influence of socialist thought in public policy and impolite conversation. Some of today's personalities could almost be said to have sprung fully formed from the mind of Ayn Rand - George Soros, Frances Fox Piven, Van Jones, Arianna Huffington, or Andy Stern. To say that Atlas Shrugged, the novel, influenced my perspective about the value of the individual, the civilizing influence of capitalism, and the virtue of the American idea would be an understatement. As far as I'm concerned Atlas Shrugged should be required reading in high schools throughout America. So, obviously I am fond of the book for its timeless quality and its eerily accurate prediction of an America that embraced socialism and strayed from its founding principles.

Thus, it was with a cautious optimism that I approached the film version with at least a hope that it would be not only watchable and entertaining but something that would be at least as imposing, profound and inspiring to a new generation of young people or perhaps have at least some small measure of the same visceral impact as, say a blend of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and Schindler's List. In that cautious optimism I was, and am, fully aware of the difficulties of bringing such a lengthy and multi-faceted work as Atlas Shrugged to theaters which may have been much of the reason that it had not made it to big screen for going on 60 years and that one film, or even a trilogy, would require some very artful way to layout the necessary exposition for filmgoers who were coming to the story fresh.

I'm very sad to report that I was extremely disappointed in the final result of this first installment. What is presented is a daytime soap-opera-cum-Harlequin Romance-version of Atlas Shrugged where wooden one- and two-dimensional characters spout ludicrous lines. To wit: Dagny Taggart to her brother James, the owners of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad (after she's unplugged the model railroad set he has been playing with in his office - Really?):

""Throughout my life I've never hurt a living thing, but if you double-cross me, I will destroy you!""

Whoa! As in totally destroy? Destroy utterly? Trample-on-your-brother's-bones-with-your-Gucci-pumps-destroy? How sophomoric. How juvenile. How All My Children childish.

Set in the very near future, 2016 (where new 2011 Toyota Camrys are driven) and presumably after Obama has failed to institute his dictatorship, Americans are somehow paying $35 a gallon for gas! You see, I told you this would happen. One must assume that hyperinflation has kicked in and the entire country is suffering through a catastrophic depression pushing wheelbarrows of worthless paper currency or something at least on the order of the 1930s Great Depression. But that's not what we see on screen. Instead we still see gleaming skyscrapers and busy throngs of people commuting and marching off to work. We see the occasional homeless or unemployed executive but we already see that today, don't we - with gas still under $5 a gallon? In fact, parts of New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and many other cities today are far grimier, spottier or downright gloomier than what's portrayed in Atlas Shrugged...so, in some respects the fate of the country controlled by a socialist and vehemently anti-capitalist government doesn't seem all that bad. In fact, America may actually have improved in the film. 2016 looks okay. Certainly the high-speed bullet train in the film is wonderful and something that should warm the heart of Barack Obama and his green minions. I mean if these rugged Randian industrialists want high-speed bullet trains and Barack Obama wants high-speed bullet trains...who are we to argue?

One of the salient challenges of the film was to update the story to fit into twenty-first century America, not the Truman-Eisenhower 1950s, Mickey Mouse Club, Van Heusen, finned Plymouth sedan America. Realizing that rewriting the Rand novel in script form, which is framed around Taggart Transcontinental Railroad and Reardon Steel to more relevant industries, say the airline industry or companies specializing in carbon-fiber composites would have distanced the film from the novel considerably and been extremely difficult to pull off. So, the hyper-inflated cost of gas is one of the reasons that train travel has become more of an economic alternative in the year 2016. So, the railroads and the steel industry stay in.

What Atlas Shrugged - The Movie - Part One predominantly suffers from is the lack of a well-crafted script. There is no cleverness in the incoherent pacing, the dialog is often laughable, and none of it is offset by any quieter moments of characters thinking upon their fate or the fate of the country. There are no scenes of rampant poverty or crime. One must simply imagine it. Suburban neighborhoods may even be surviving this desperate, hyper-inflated, depressed future. Or maybe not. There's no way to tell. Many of the scenes seem to be just quickly thrown together as in Wesley Mouch's speech on the steps of some government building somewhere which has a mere gaggle of poorly-directed extras. The scene presumably takes place somewhere in Washington, D.C. but really could be in any city anywhere -- which is another bone to pick with the film. The government buildings of D.C. are iconic symbols of power - why not show them? Capra, Hitchcock, Ridley Scott, Alan J. Pakula and countless other directors have used them to convey massive power and the corruption of power and if ever there was a story that needed to nail that association to power unrestrained it would be Atlas Shrugged that for some reason avoids showing D.C. at all. Go figure. And the sinister and Machiavellian machinations of politicians and bureaucrats are portrayed without any subtlety, any credibility or any sophistication. I've seen films based on comic book characters that portray politicians and bureaucrats much more realistically.

Nor is the script savvy about how corporations function or how corporate executives behave. Given the state of this desperate and gloomy near-future world (that is lurking elsewhere throughout the film apparently), industrialists, like the rugged steel magnate Hank Reardon in particular, appear to be quite nave and cut off from reality. Corporate executives have no attorneys to consult and unhappily sign away their holdings to the government-designated competitors in frustrated resignation.

In one scene the tall, ominous shadowy figure of John Galt easily has access to oil and gas fat-cat Ellis Wyatt's unfenced, un-gated, un-patrolled property and his resplendent Victorian mansion nestled somewhere in the Colorado Rockies. Of course, Wyatt answers his own front door in the middle of the night, without looking at a security monitor, without a dog by his side or handgun in his hand. Tall, ominous, shadowy men in trench coats and Fedoras apparently often make the rounds at night to remote Victorian mansions in the Rockies just to talk and spirit rich industrialists away to a land of milk and honey.

If these were isolated moments throughout the film it might be forgivable but sadly the film is replete with such implausible or silly scenes and one has to feel sorry for the actors to have to deal with such lame material. Two audience members guffawed at several of the sillier moments at the screening I attended. It's one of the only times I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers because I really wanted the message in the material to somehow survive.

The film has no discernable visual or cinematic style, almost as though the production designer and the cinematographer phoned in their work. Sets are schlocky and amateurish particularly the office of Hank Reardon whose steel and glass desk set seems to have been quickly tossed together and placed at the end of, or in the middle of a hallway. In one board meeting of Taggart Transcontinental a phone conference unit in the center of the table was placed there to give the boardroom a more tech-looking feel. It would have been better, though if the unit hadn't already been about 8 years old or in the timeframe of this film 15-years old. A video conferencing system with large flat panel monitors would have been more appropriate - as in Minority Report or episodes of CSI/New York.

Camera angles are unimaginative and usually shot at shoulder height, shamefully dull for a film. Were cranes or SteadyCams too expensive to rent? Hank Reardon and his one-dimensional snotty-shrew-of-a-wife's anniversary party is a colossal and awkward bore. It lacks any interesting choreography and the film audience begins to wonder whether it was necessary to even invite them to it.

Some scenes don't even seem to advance the plot at all and at one point Dagny Taggart and Hank Reardon hopscotch all around the country to speak with people in their attempt to track down the inventor (who is John Galt) of a mysterious and highly-advanced ""atmospheric motor"" Reardon has discovered in an abandoned factory in Wisconsin. Dagny amazingly discerns how the motor works because even though she's a stunningly beautiful industrialist she's also a bit of a Nicola Tesla, too. My kinda gal. This montage and highly expensive cross-country quest is quite necessary because the principle characters have seemingly forgotten how to use a phone or the director needed some more outdoor shots to lighten up the film.

The visual set piece of the film is the aforementioned bullet train snaking through the foothills of the Rockies at 250 miles per hour on newly installed Reardon steel tracks. The bullet train, the tracks it races on and even the nifty steel bridge that Hank Reardon has whipped up in three months are all the result of Taggart's and Reardon's whirlwind and successful business venture which, of course leads to their very predictable love affair that the audience had seen coming the minute the two appeared on the screen together.

Atlas Shrugged has an endless number of plot holes big enough to ram a high-speed bullet train through and with the silly dialogue, awkward situations and second- and third-rate production values is enough to distract the audience from the message of the film. It's almost as though 60 years was too short a time to get the film right.

This certainly was not the review I wanted to write when I first heard that this film was in production. I don't think Atlas Shrugged is salvageable unless there are hours and hours of film and scenes not used that somehow could be cobbled together and re-edited. The only advice I might give the producers at this point is to take the film back, have it remastered in grainy, sepia-tone and make the sky in each outdoor sequence dark and sooty looking. But that's just a band-aid. Other than that, folks, read or re-read the book and imagine how good it could have been.

In the film's final scene upon seeing the destruction of Wyatt's oil refinery... (by his own hand because, like his nearby Victorian mansion, he has no security detail to discourage him from destroying his own plant or otherwise catch him and hold him for psychiatric evaluation) Dagny Taggart lets out what can only be described as a primal scream.

4843463,3,B005N4DMMG,"I loved the book - I wish it were a lesson that more people were open to, as it is a real cautionary tale. I liked the first one, but not sure I would have, had I not read the book.  Taylor Schilling is pretty and not bad - but this movie does not show the indefatigable strength, combined with love of life, of Dagny's character.  Similarly with Grant Bowler as Hank Reardon.  He is physically wrong for Hank (Hank is a big man), and doesn't demonstrate his towering strength of character.  Though he does show Hank's love of life, it is an impish quality here, which is nice - but not Hank Reardon.  Hank's love of live, in the book, shows itself in enormous vitality, which is missing here.  This first installment also doesn't show us the magnitude of energy and effort it took both of these characters to get where they are; the amount of work and dedication Hank put into inventing Reardon metal, or the tireless dedication of Dagny to her railway, to the exclusion of really anything else.

Nonetheless, it is a beginning; and a beginning to a story that deserves to be told, that deserves to be listened to; a story that could wake people up out of their dazed acceptance of the erosion of their freedoms, not even realizing that this is what is occurring.

Watching this adaption of Rand's novel on the movie screen was fastening.  Watching that train speed along those gleaming silver rails of Readen metal was breath taken.  The world is just seeing the disappearing of the wealth producers.  I'm going to watch part 2 today.  I already know ""Who John Gault is"", I read the book.  When I read the book I was taken with Rand's vision and how over the years she had predicted history. Here story is becoming more history as the years proceed.

I read some of the reviews on amazon and I agree that a lot of them were politically motivated, but so was this movie. the acting and the production were top-notch but the story-line left me wanting what the screenplay didn't deliver. I give it credit for urging me to buy and watch part 2, only because I was desperate to find out what happens and to answer all the questions left dangling.  don't get your hopes up unless you crave disappointment, or maybe there will be a part 3 that can fill in all the holes?????",1365811200,4,616,4.4035087719298245
4843468,3,B005N4DMMG,It's relatable but the story moves slow and is not interesting at times. The acting could be a little more believable. In part two they change main actors so the story seems to flow even less. This is not a big budget film. I'm sure the book is better to read. I'm being kind giving it 3 stars.

I didn't find myself poo-poo-ing the cars in the background, etc. Characters were reasonably developed, and we got just a bit of the flavor of each. Hank was a more-rigid character in the book, and Dagney perhaps a bit softer. Considering the 1.5+/- hours they had to get to the end of ""part 1"", not too bad.

The other problem I had was that the movie was dark.  I don't mean dark in subject matter (that is important to the story).  The ""darkness"" I refer to is hard to see.  We viewed it on our flat screen TV, which is normally bright enough.  It was impossible to see some of the scenes well enough to know what was happening.

4843487,4,B005N4DMMG,"Weaving together a number of interconnected sub-plots is far more difficult in a movie than in a book. When we see a Shakespeare play for the first time, the subtleties and undercurrents are completely invisible, and we may not even know who many of the characters are. That said, most viewers of Atlas Shrugged have probably read it, so they know what the story is, who the minor characters are -- even semi-major characters such as Francisco D'Anconia -- and how they fit into the overall story.

The other difficulty is to cast characters that don't clash wildly with the mental images we have naturally formed when reading the book.

On both of these scores, Atlas Shrugged does better than expected.

Those of us who like railroads are also delighted with the cameo appearance of a real humping operation and several great shots of real track-building.

The movie rhetoric from Washington is very much like what we hear from both Bush and Obama administrations (not to go further back). If we close our eyes, we could easily imagine the same words emanating from the 10 o'clock news.

On the downside, we find occasional lines that are delivered as if the actor is reading them for the first time from a teleprompter, and of course the necessary suspension of disbelief regarding the civilization that still works (cell phones, good roads), nonsense technology such as the new motor, and the idea that an undergraduate degree in engineering is a qualification for anything more than an introductory technical job.

Irrelevancies and distractions include an accidental view of Dagny's midriff that should have been cut, and one lone smoker -- casting this in 2016, rather than the mid 20th century, means that no one should smoke, certainly not one of the life-oriented characters.

The most jarring disconnect is right at the end, when Dagny screams. Completely out of character.",1365033600,,1884,4.961904761904762

Rand's message is, in my opinion a little off. The top creative people in a field are responsible for innovation; they're the reason we're not driving oxcarts and wearing furs. It's the millions of productive if not exceptional people who keep the wheels of everyday industry moving; if the top people disappear things would keep going, though not as well as before. In Rand's world a lot of those regular people have become takers instead of producers, so the outcome she envisions is possible.

She also clearly shows destructivecive results of political power in the hands of ideologues and the behind the scenes corruption that always follows from this.

4843553,5,B005N4DMMG,"The below story exhibits the very core of this movie.  The eerie part is that the novel was written in 1957 and our current policies mirror the very issues highlighted by the below and Atlas.

READ THIS...

An economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but had recently failed an entire class. That class had insisted that Obama's socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer.

The professor then said, ""OK, we will have an experiment in this class on Obama's plan"".. All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A.... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all).

After the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.

The second test average was a D! No one was happy.
When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.

As the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.

To their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed. Could not be any simpler than that. (Please pass this on) These are possibly the 5 best sentences you'll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:

1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.

2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.

3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.

4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!

5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.

4843578,1,B005N4DMMG,"First, the film itself: This was at best a ""B"" movie. The actors were second-rate. So, of course, the acting was as well. It had a very ""made for tv"" movie feel to it. Even the effects were at least a decade behind current standards. There was not much in terms of the making of this movie that was of great value or significance. The obvious interest or draw to this movie is entirely it's political message. Based on the high ratings, we can safely assume that most of the people who are interested in this movie already know about Rand and her philosophy and find it appealing and therefore, would be prone to overlooking the poor filmmaking in order to view the message.

I feel the politics of this movie are fair game to comment on because it is a political thriller and because it detracts from the believability of the story. There are many things wrong with this story as a result of Rand's philosophy of selfishness. The overall theme of the movie was that there are only a few ""makers"" in this world that really do anything worthwhile and without them, the rest of us would be doomed. This is insulting on so many levels and ridiculous in terms of history and reality. When a vacancy is left, for whatever reason, there is always new and eager talent ready to fill the void. That is how it has been in this country historically. We have no shortage of great thinkers, leaders and innovators. To imply otherwise is simply elitist. Rand's ridiculous attempts to blame a Democratic government for many problems that are created by corporations themselves, shows her lack of knowledge and experience with industry. She is a writer and philosopher by trade, not an inventor or a businesswoman. For example, she blames the government for stifling innovation when in fact it has often been industry who stifles innovation and the government who provides various grants and incentives that drive innovation. Why would any company want to create limitless energy when there is greater profit in limited fossil fuels? It would be the fossil fuel industry itself that would have the greatest motive to stifle this kind of discovery, not the government. The primary function of corporations is profit-making, not to improve the lives of fellow Americans. Promoting the general welfare is the function of government. And one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie was when the ""heroine"", Dagny Taggart, orders her inferior to essentially tell the government to get the hell out of her way and bypass any required permits necessary to build. That was quite the elitist diva moment in that she reveals her belief that because she is so important and so much better than everyone else, the rules should not apply to her or interfere with what she hopes to accomplish. She is a ""maker"" and therefore her ambitions should be paramount. I could go on and on. But the last irritating part that I will mention was when Dagny demands that everyone, including the government, just do as she says because she ""believes"" based on her education, that the new, untested material will work. And of course, in the world according to Ayn Rand, she was right. In the real world, in the real reality, people with excellent educations and experience, sometimes make bad calls. And not everyone has to bow down and kiss your *** because you are a ""maker"" and you have a hunch. In this world, people want and deserve better than to put their lives in the hands of one person's (who stands to make a ridiculous profit)best guess without backing it up with testing and scientific data. She (Dagny/Ayn Rand) wants us to believe that we should put our full faith in corporations whose main purpose is to generate profit. Rand is very naive to believe that corporations are above the same kinds of corruption and grabs for power as governments. If you know Rand's personal history, you understand why she glorifies Capitalism and despises Socialism. But, her pendulum has swung too far and out of balance. The reality is, government needs checks and balances to avoid dictatorship and the abuse of the people. Corporations are no different. They need checks in the form of sensible government regulation to avoid disaster for the people (like the recession we just experienced which was due largly in part to unchecked corporate greed). Their power also needs to be kept in check so that is does not overwhelm the voice of the people or our government of the people. Most Americans understand that the truth, the reality of what works best, lies somewhere in between pure Socialism and pure Capitalism. And that is why Rand's philosophies have been largly dismissed by history and by most Americans and embraced by a few idealogues.",1360886400,15,4707,4.782555282555283

4843581,1,B005N4DMMG,"I have to take issue with some of the previous reviews.  This movie was dreadful.  The dialogue is painfully bad, with actors reciting unintentionally comical sentences.  The characters in this movie are just not believable, which is what you end up with when making a movie about a book that is so divorced from reality.  If you turn the sound off and just watch the visuals, the movie is less bad.  There's some impressive scenery and gorgeous scenes of the western United States, but when you actually listen to the actors, this film is excruciating.  Ayn Rand may have had a small cult of dedicated followers, but her work is not exactly art.  It's more like pulp science fiction, and not the delightfully cheesy kind like Sharktopus.  This movie is what I would create if I wanted to parody right-wing economic theory.  That an actual right-winger created this unintentional self-parody is amusing to me, and it's worth watching this movie just to make fun of it with your friends.  It reminds me of the scene from ""Ted"" when Mark Wahlberg's character is watching the old 1980 version of ""Flash Gordon"" with his Teddy Bear friend, while they both goof on the movie.  Atlas Shrugged is WAY cheesier than Flash Gordon.  It's worth watching only if you want to laugh at the strange little fantasy world that right-wingers have created for themselves, where comically villainous liberals have figuratively tied the heroic capitalists to the railroad tracks, while stroking their grungy soul patches.  I look forward to seeing part II, if only to confirm my suspicions that it will be unintentionally hilarious.",1360713600,12,1611,4.9222222222222225

Now the election is behind us and has wound its way down, I decided to see what this was all about. The movie is written for a specific audience. The major topic of the movie is gov't interference. Unfortunately, it reminds you of this time and time again. Whether through action or conversation, they drive the point home so often you could make a drinking game out of it.
As movie's go, it's okay. I was interested the whole way through, and I'm curious in seeing part II. Though I wish they had just wrapped it up. The point of the movie has been made.

4843587,5,B005N4DMMG,"I ordered first the book from Amazon, then the movie. I became quite interested in Ayn Rand. She has a remarkable intelligence
and a surprising command of the English language based on her epistemological foundation. All the more surprising since she
came to us from the USSR and I am awed at her transition into a classical writer.
I found her views challenging to some of my beliefs but upon reflection I realize that what might be called mysticism in my ability
in shamanic healing, it is actually scientific. I wonder at her adamant demand for morality, how do people who don't have it,
acquire it. It takes more than thought and reason. There is a proven reflection in peoples lives who have embraced meditation.
It is the energy of the soul or the intuitive factor that is inherent in the human experience. It has changed peoples lives where-
upon they have embraced morality, and reformed. (If it was introduced to James Taggart's wife before she decided to commit
suicide, it would certainly have changed the story).This is maybe an aspect that Ayn Rand couldn't grasp with her belief in
atheism. Which I laud, considering the madness of the born again Jesus freaks permeating the 'right' faction in US politics.
The thinking mind of intellectualism provides the answers yes, but the soul provides the solutions.
Nevertheless I find her writing riveting, and her views do a great service for ones ability to stay 'grounded' and not to lose
sight of reason and the importance of thinking!

What I was met with was a slow boil story that was part conspiratorial thriller, part big business political drama, and part character drama.  Persons who have business backgrounds or are financially minded will likely enjoy this a lot more than those of us who are not.  For myself (an ""am not"" of the financially minded ones) it took me a bit to get interested in the bits and pieces of the big business haves, who have visions of grandeur, and the political mammon sychophants who want to disrupt and divert the flow of money and progress through their own pockets first while talking about giving the meager minions cake.  By movie's end (or, shall I say, installment's end?) I was hooked and will be checking out part II.

That chapter in the book was WAY too long and drawn out. For the critics, remember this is fiction and the main point is to show a view that is not expressed often enough in many parts of the world and especially here in the USA. That doesn't mean that Ayn Rand's view is 100% correct but that there is another side to the story. That is, we need to appreciate some of the accomplishments and contributions that industry leaders have given us rather than always cast them as the greedy, evil Capitalists. OTOH, Socialism, in limited forms can be useful too.

The acting was just fine - I loved Dagny and Hank, though not so much Francisco (that may change in Part 2).
That Rand's ideas are getting a bit more exposure is excellent, though it may be too late for the USA with Obama's recent re-election. Sadly, you can't cheat reality forever, and Obama's ""Orren Boyle"" philosophy will eventually bankrupt the country.

The story deals with how socialism tries to crush big business capitalism, and how two ceo's work together to try to save their company from falling prey to an ever increasing power hungry government, who works against them, at the cost of jobs and financial security, as America is being brought to her knees by socialist politics. The story is actually more interesting than it sounds, and makes a very powerful statement to our country to be careful what we wish for.

I'd say on the list of bad, bad script adaptation, no interest/empathy in character, bad casting, bad acting (what I saw of the actors within 10 minutes), bad set design, etc.
In fact, I looked at all the ""5 star"" reviews and thought I must have been in a bad mood when I tried watching it the first time, so I pulled it up on Netflix and tried again. Nope.  I was right the first time, bad movie.
I know the story, as the book is one of my all time favorites that I have reread for years.
Within the first 10 minutes of ANY movie, you're supposed to hook the audience in with the character, give them a reason to continue watching.  You do this, by giving them an interesting character, that's put into an interesting scenario.  Now, having read the book, these are some very interesting characters, but the writer, and director failed at pulling me into the story.  I wasn't interested in what was going on.  I watched it, and it all seemed ""forced"".  It didn't feel natural, it felt like I was watched a staged performance. The sets, felt like a set, instead of an office.  Could be what they shot it on too. But I've seen all sorts of movies, and it isn't the amount of money they spend on it, nor them having ""A-Star"" actors, or the amount of VFX.  It ALL comes back to...quality of story and ability to portray that story onto the screen.

4843626,3,B005N4DMMG,"Unfortunately, for anyone that has slogged through 1,100 pages of the trilogy which is Atlas Shrugged, the movie version does not meet expectations.

Ayn Rand spent pages describing, sometimes in excruciating detail - every curve of the lip, rise of the eyebrow, fall of hair across the forehead. She also gave her characters lengthy speeches on their philosophy of life wrapped as long winded conversations that despite the length, gave deep, meaningful depth to her characters.

All that depth, substance, motivation is lost in this shallow movie which cut out much of the literary genius of Ayn Rand. Francisco D'Anconia is just not credible as a playboy heir to a family fortune. Hank Rearden was not as discribed in the book.
The cast of characters are trying hard but they were cast incorrectly. The movie shortchanged the book by cutting some of the finest literary dialogues out (there's actual dead silence for many seconds during Hanks Anniversary party - in the book that party had multiple group dialogues going on simultaneously.

Ugh. So disappointing to see Ayn Rands masterpiece reduced to a B Rated movie. This should have been done by Spielberg, or other great producer/director with first rate actors ---

4843629,4,B005N4DMMG,"The differing of opinions is so interesting.  The critics hammered this movie mercilessly, but it was much better than I expected.  The movie, production quality and performances are all terrific, especially the actors playing Rearden and Dagney Taggart.  What's more difficult to process is the film's message.

  In a nutshell, the film proposes that it's really only the ""successful"" people that make the world go 'round.  They improve the quality of life on earth.  They pay for the infrastructure.  They provide the jobs for the masses through their companies.  They push technological advancement, etc.  The rest of the 99.9999% of the world's population are just ""takers""; a drag on the wheel of progress that don't really contribute anything.  It's because of the entitlement attitude of all these people and their cronies in government and special interest groups, that the corporate executives lose their freedoms through federal business over-regulation.  As a result, the gifted businessmen, scientists, engineers, etc. leave the country, causing society's infrastructure to collapse without their genius and financial contributions.

  I completely understand how government today takes a socialist approach to business and stifles economic freedoms and development through over-regulation.  Even as a liberal, I don't agree that someone's income should be seized and redistributed to the less fortunate, if that income was made fairly and honestly...no matter HOW huge the profit is.  I also recognize the benefit of corporations and the enormous philanthropic donations they make to the programs that serve the masses.

  Having said that, I had to roll my eyes several times at the audacious implication by several of the characters, that billionaire corporate executives are the ""real"" victims.  I'm sorry.  I just can't feel sorry for someone who lost $1 billion in a stock market downturn that still has $49 billion in the bank!  It's laughable that these people are made out to be the ""damsels in distress"" of this story.  I do understand what Rand is trying to say and agree with much of her theory.

  Still, it's VERY simplistic to make corporations out to be the victims in this story, as lily white do-gooders.  We ALL know that's just NOT true.  Enron, anyone?  Rand wrote this novel 60+ years before CEOs raided employee IRA accounts, mass layoffs, manufacturing was sent to China & Mexico and the mortgage fraud tragedy.  She doesn't even imply in her story that most of these corporations that she deems so saintly are polluting the environment on a colossal scale through mercury dumps in the ocean, oil spills, etc. Is that really helping to hold the world up and improve society?

  I CRINGED when Rearden, even as a likeable character, said to Dagney, ""WE'RE the ones who really matter"" [in the world].  Ugh.  Really?  As humans, we forget that money wasn't always with us.  WE CREATED money.  Life can go on just fine without it.  Before money...who was it that REALLY mattered?  Let's see.  It was the farmers, tailors, home builders, innkeepers, blacksmiths, bakers, medicine man, etc.  It was the people who had tangible skills that could meet the most important necessities of life, NOT 21st Century corporate autocrats that just push paper around a desk and move computer blips across a screen to make more money.  How does THAT make the world a better place?  How does THAT make them matter more?  I think not.  They provide no REAL, tangible service to the world.  Let's not forget the artists, poets, singers, composers, dancers and painters who have enriched the world's soul in ways what are simply incalculable in their value.  What do corporate heads REALLY provide, directly from their own hands, that really contribute to society?  If all the money disappeared from the earth tomorrow, what would they have to trade or share to create their way in the world?  Nothing.  It's the 99% that are truly the ""salt of the earth"".

  So, let's keep all this in perspective.  Rand takes a VERY black and white approach...and may I say, a very dated one.  That's why I ended up feeling conflicted.  I understand the need for corporate freedom in our society and government corruption should be rooted out at all levels...but so should corporate corruption.  We also need to remember that it's people that make this world great, NOT companies...because what are companies, but groups of people anyway?",1357516800,,4438,5.081944444444445

4843637,4,B005N4DMMG,"As most people who have read Ayn Rand's book of this title, I found it an engaging read.  But the thing is about a thousand pages long--and the problem of compressing it into movie is naturally quite difficult.  Given the challenge of compressing or simplifying the plot to the point were it can fit into a movie format, I think that the screenwriters have done surprisingly well.

The whole thing with the Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden romance was quite compelling--and their first run on the John Galt Line was wonderful.  But after their ride on the John Galt Line and the beginning of their romance, I felt that the plot was speeding up in an unsettling way.

In Hank and Dagny's trip to the 20th Century Motor Company to seek out the inventor of the engine, events unfolded too quickly.  To imagine that they were able to quickly find the engine in that huge abandoned factory complex, and quickly figure out from blue prints and a visual inspection of the engine what it was able to do, was a little too hard for me to accept.  In the book they had to hire a young physicist who took weeks or longer to grasp what that engine was about.  Also, to have John Galt's voice explicitly give the pitch to Elias Wyatt in a phone message, about why he should ditch everything and join Galt and his buddies at the end of the film, took away from the mystery of John Galt much too soon.

I just imagine that at some point of the screenwriting process the writers started saying to themselves (or the producer or director telling them) ""Christ! Do you realize all the stuff we still have to fit in?  And we haven't even come to John Galt's speech! Get a move on for Christ's sake!",1357344000,,1676,4.412337662337662

The book, as in almost all cases, is more complete and provides much more detail, but the movie is a pretty good representation. I saw this and the second movie before I read the book. What is great about watching the movie before reading the book is that you can get a general idea of all the characters and it allows you to follow the story and characters much more easily when you read the book. It is unfortunate that the same actors could not be used for the second movie. It will be interesting to see who they get for the third one.",1357344000,,627,4.147540983606557

If you read the book in 3 parts, as written, you will be up-to-date with each of the Parts of the movies.  Because Ayn Rand is so fabulously descriptive in every line she writes, you can feel the emotions of the characters, along with the scenes, but be ready to dedicate a lot of time to reading the book.

The movie is, in contrast, a simple script which doesn't cover anywhere NEAR the story in the book.  I enjoyed it very much, but without having read Part 1 of Atlas Shrugged, I wouldn't have been able to fill in the blanks.  I hope all you readers enjoy this book as much as I did.

When people who are inspired and motivated to create a product or service that has a value to consumers, they should be rewarded by the success that the free market allows. Some people among us are more talented and more driven than others, thus they can create more monitary success. We all benefit from their talent via jobs, economic stimulus, and even charitible giving on their part. Charity derives from created wealth. When government interferes with the imagination and creativity of the individual entrepreneur via high taxation, regulation, or union control, we all lose because the business owner realizes there will be no profit or reward from the created product or service invented or marketed. When the motivation for the reward is no longer seen by the entrepreneur, they stop producing. Thus, we all lose in the process as the risk takers stop investing and stop creating. There are no new jobs, so there are less people employed, less money being raised in taxes, etc. Atlas Shrugged illustrates how corrupt government in its jealousy and eagerness to be in control of success, does everything it can to destroy the very thing that it should be trying to encourage.

Toward the middle, it became very classy, and I even recommended it to my dad, even though he doesn't like philosophical movies. The scenes jumped around a lot, and was a bit hard to follow, but there was a lot of cover. Maybe the dialogue and acting were slightly unrealistic,  but even from the book you knew people didn't really talk like that.

The actors were perfect in their roles.  Taylor Schilling & Grant Bowling were the epitome of Dagney & Hank and seemed to have walked right out of Rand's book. I cannot wait until I see the parts two & three. As I write this, part two is showing in theatres and part three has a scheduled release date of July 4, 2014.

A final note is that I don't agree with all aspects of Rand's philosophy, and I think that capatalism in it's purist form, as espoused by Rand, doesn't work in a world of finite resources.  Not everything should have a price, e.g., the environment, wildlife, etc.  My critique, however, is not on Rand's philosophy but on how well the book was rendered into a movie.

I had no idea that it ever existed until I saw ads on TV about ""Atlas Shrugged, part 2"". Out of curiosity, I went to Amazon and discover that there not only was a part 1, but they had it available. I bought it, watched it, loved, and then went to see part 2 at the only threatre in Indianapolis where it was showing. That, too, itself was a surprise. Why was that one threatre the only one in the area where it was showing? I had waited a month for it to come to the local cinema! The only reason that both parts of this story didn't get wide distribution must be because it is so political incorrect. Too bad. I highly recomment both movies.",1356393600,,773,4.092105263157895

Surely her personal life was controversial and her novels were popular during her lifetime.  Her unique philosophy easily found many followers in the America (especially amongst Replublicans).

I have purchased book collection of her work, but unfortunately did not get around to reading it.  I am disclosing this because I will not be comparing her book(s) with this movie.  Film is made with the cast of the virtually unknown actors.  It is part one (1) of three (3).  I initially planned to see it in the movie theatres but the rmovie run was fairly short - I giess not enough interest, or poor marketing, however you wish to look at it.  Finally, I got to watch it on DVD.  Two main characters are independently wealthy people with zest for life and unbendable will.  They are determined to make a world a better place and for that idea are willing to join forces and fight the ""establishment"". It is a mix of ideal persons who have strong desire to be successful without compromising their moral beliefs (which we are supposed to believe are good and mean no hurt to anyone).

I do not know what to think about the film.  It is a love story between two intelligent people. They make their own rules along the way in this story.  They are not necessarily altruistic - their (mutual) goal is to be rich stay rich, and of course find a way to be even more rich.  The first part made me lukewarm. but I will give it a chance and see the entire trilogy.

1. It's faithful
2. The acting was great
3. The cinematography was great
4. The story was well told
5. It's entertaining.

That's about it. If you agree with Rand at all then you'll adore this movie, as it stands I don't simply because I don't agree with its message. But with that said I cannot forgo a positive review because of my own political bias. As a film and in terms of a story Atlas Shrugged was good. The back bone of it, the philosophy behind it, that's what I had a problem with. But again, I'm not going to be an idiot simply because I didn't like it.

All of them were unknowns, which I kind of liked, and all were really good actors.

4843729,4,B005N4DMMG,"OMG! ""ATLAS SHRUGGED Part I"" is the ""Lord of the Rings"" of Moral Relativism(tm)(you might say; and I'll tell why I say it shortly). I loved the book and I LOVE this movie, which I saw tonight.

Forget any negative non-sense you may have heard about this great film. Personally, I don't follow popular culture and I've stopped paying attention to Ayn Rand fans since most of them (for ethnic reasons, it turns out) refuse to face up to who really did nine-one-one, but I digress.

So I was pleasantly surprised (shocked, actually) when I saw this DVD sitting on the shelf at the public library this afternoon. I brought it right home and popped it into the DVD player!

All you need to know about ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" is that the mark of a good film lies in its ability to grab your attention and drag you into the story, managing to get you to suspend disbelief as you sit back and just watch it (like, to the end). Now I have honed my skills at entertaining ideas, as Aristotle put it (and Ayn truly LOVED Aristotle), so I can watch almost anything. Your mileage may vary, but I'd be willing to bet a few Reardon Rails that you are going to enjoy this film IF you make it past the first few minutes.

As for the moral relativism issue, well moral relativism may be defined in several ways (hey, it's moral RELATIVISM, eh). Basically it means that morality is totally subjective, based upon what is good for you.

Ayn Rand, being a curmudgeon like no other, and a misanthropic reprobate to boot, called her version of moral relativism ""OBJECTIVISM"" (and NO, Will Duncan, I am not trying to be facetious here; this is the God's honest truth, though Ayn didn't believe in one).

Historian Paul Johnson penned a nasty little screed titled ""The Intellectuals"" that chucked the chick peas about how many leading intellectuals are creepy beyond belief and dishonest hypocrites as well -- sometimes even criminal. You should read it. Unless you are an intellectual lol. Johnson didn't include Ayn Rand in his book, but he should have because she carried these tendencies to the extreme, probably beyond any of the highly magnified featherless bipeds he did include in his table of contents).

Ayn Rand micromanaged the lives and thoughts of her disciples; ruined people's lives and drove them mad; practiced illicit (and possibly perverted) sex with several of them, including perhaps her ethnic fellow Allen Greenspan; fell in love and sucked up to a serial killer; defended Einstein's reputation with smears and calumny; championed the bogus Austrian Economic theories of Ludwig Von Mises (which do not even attempt to furnish any mathematical proof that they are true, and thus are a soft -- e.g. unscientific -- science lol lol lol); she looked down her nose at the bicycle (it didn't go fast enough, I suppose); and Ayn did her level best to destroy Western Culture by teaching its members to shun any efforts to cooperate in their communities and improve the lot of one another, calling this ""collectivism,"" while her own ethnic tribe ""famously provided communal support and charitable assistance for their own."" Of course, Ayn's last name wasn't really ""Rand,"" but I'll leave it to you to learn what it was. If you have read this far, just Google the phrase ""Ayn Rand and The Trust."" Be warned that it leads to a blog that may seem ""hateful"" to the uninformed, so don't say I didn't warn you. I suppose that some things should be hated, and since this is still America, you retain the unalienable Right to read and think for yourself? As nasty as that may sound. You *are* literate, are you not? Capable of mentation? If so, and if you are not afraid to ""entertain ideas"" (with Aristotle), I wholeheartedly suggest that you take a peek and Google the phrase I typed above.

OK. So you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, but you probably could write great literature on a parchment made from a pig's skin. Right?  Even a broken clock tells time correctly twice a day. Correct? In similar fashion, Ayn Rand managed to write two dynamite, books that are soooo spot-on about certain truths that are self-evident to all but the most terminally selfless, that so-called and self-styled altruists and progressives simply hate the very ground old Ayn walked upon. Every single square inch of it!

Where, in my opinon, does this film version fall short? It doesn't, neither does the book. However, you must realize one very important thing, or your mind may be inoperably twisted by exposure to the ideas presented here.

Ayn Rand offers what is known in the trade as a ""limited hangout."" In other words, she builds up her entire schtick upon a foundation that is missing its very cornerstone. This will certainly lead you to blame the very real culture distortion and the truly horrific effects of the altruistic hypocrisy that she describes... blame them upon the wrong people and causes. This is no big surprise, given her ethnic roots and their penchant for manipulating economic paradigms, including the current economic paradigm, which has been current since they created it about the time the Bank of ""England"" got its start. (What fun!)

So... do I approve of the society that Atlas Shrugged appears to champion? As a fellow moral relativist, I confess that I do, because I would fit in very well and go far. So might you, if only you could clean out some of the non-sense from your mind, such ""mental cobwebs"" that keep you from noticing facts and from true mentation. Don't give up hope because it's possible that you might do that. In fact, if you really want to, you probably can do that, though you might need to hit rock bottom first (or take part in a train crash like the one Ayn writes about, snark, snark snark). Thank you; and good night!

P.S.Taylor Schilling rocks, as Dagney!",1355011200,,5799,4.701477832512316
4843730,4,B005N4DMMG,"The book is a tome, about 1200 pages long. That's amazing when you consider the author typed this sucker out on an Underwood or Corona typewriter about 65 years ago. I can imagine her expression when her editor told her to work on a section located on about page 350. This movie is the first of a multi-part film mini-series. It is pretty true to the beginning of the book, and is about the only part of the book with a ""happy ending"". This series of films, if the future editions remain as true to the novel as this one, you will need a bottle of prozac to get you through the evening.

The casting was a joke, as none of the characters represented even an inkling of what you would expect of them, and the acting itself was severely sub-par to say the least. I would expect that even among those that have not read the book, the movie is a let down.

4843760,4,B005N4DMMG,"This movie introduces a LOT of information very quickly. Lots of names, locations, and events are thrown in very quickly, and if you have not read the book, keeping track of these would be a chore. From my perspective, this movie was more ""this is what I visualized when reading the book"" and less ""lets convert this book into a movie."" Those are two very big differences.

So if you read the book, I would recommend you watch this movie, even if it's just to see what someone else visualized while reading the book. If you did not read the book, you might be lost.

When we elect someone to office, we should understand their belief system, is it based on the founding documents of this republic, or is it based on what feels good now, and what is politically correct. Atlas Shrugged exposes the snake oil politicians for who they are, and provides insight into the human spirit of what makes success.

4843788,4,B005N4DMMG,"What I like about this film is its view ""inside the mansion.""  The successful don't laugh an evil laugh while they twirl their mustaches.  The rich in this movie have wedding anniversaries, take investment advice from trusted friends, and keep the family business' open. I enjoyed this take on the human side to the wealthy. It's not a view from the outside looking in at their money, power, and political pull. It is a revelation that a rich (hu)man should not be accosted with open criticism. It hits them the same way it hits anyone. Be honest: you'd tell a guy to shut up and mind his own business if he found out how much you make and shamed you for not giving more to the underprivileged. Who made him judge of who gets to spend what and when? And how does everyone in the entire world fit into his office to get his ok before each purchase?",1353456000,,847,4.3544303797468356

4843791,1,B005N4DMMG,"This film is so, so, so bad that I can't wait for Part II and may have to read the book again.
I remember originally reading Ayn Rand's little hedonisms way back in the late '60s.  The righteous individual against the tyranical state.  Capitalism against communism.  Ah, the world was so much simpler in the age of the Cold War.  Couldn't believe that the intellectual leader of the Republican/Tea Party, Paul Ryan, claimed Ayn as his philosophical mentor. It has much to say about his lack of depth and even more his lack of empathy for the plight of others. While as an humanist, I have little problem with Rand's aetheism, I consider her lack of consideration / understanding for anyone other than Nieztche type supermen as a deal breaker when it comes to giving a sense of how to govern in this post modern age.  Little Pauly's budget plans are far less christian than even his own catholic council of bishops could tolerate. It's one thing for Ayn to be godless; it's quite another that the bible thumpin' Ryan, Republican Right and Tea Party are so unchristian.  That Paul Ryan's recent ascendance has given us an Ayn Rand revival is very much more an indictment of the two of them.  This film is cheesy, campe ... a ""Spring Time for Hitler ..."" within ""The Producers"".  If viewed this way, we may have another ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" on our hands.  Otherwise, it makes Rand out to be as intellectually cartoonish as her simple minded student Ryan ... in our age where some 1 percenters brush away 47% in one dismissive swipe.

The film is brilliantly stupid and benign.  Can't wait for round 2.  I'm going to watch on my old TV set ... so I can throw things at the screen.",1353369600,14,1683,4.5364238410596025
4843792,3,B005N4DMMG,"This movie has none of the power or impact of Rand's book unfortunately.

4843793,4,B005N4DMMG,This is an amazing movie. The story was written in the 1930s but is so revelant with what's going on in todays world.  A must watch in order to see the sequel that opens Nov 2012 in theatres. Excellent movie a must see.,1353369600,,219,4.093023255813954
4843794,2,B005N4DMMG,The Book was way better.  They tried to make a movie from an 800 plus page novel but I believe was short on money.  Way too much was left out and the acting was too canned.  The book is a MUST READ for anyone who is concerned about this country but the movie did not do the book justice at all.,1353369600,,294,3.7868852459016393
4843795,3,B005N4DMMG,The book was fantastic.  Much of the suspense of the book was ruined by them showing a black figure showing up before the disappearance of each character.  It was anti-climactic.  Then I find that the ENTIRE cast has been changed for part 2.  I would also have like to see some additional character development.  It seems like the whole first part went way too fast.  I was hoping to be thrilled by the movie but was left feeling neutered.,1353369600,,439,4.493670886075949

4843799,5,B005N4DMMG,"Having seen the movie several times in theatres in 2010 and being a fan of Ayn Rand's novel, I am delighted to be able to purchase this historic presentation (Part 1 of 3) from Amazon to share with friends. This controversial film that is finding hardly any favorable reviews from the so-called critics is well deserving of highest praise for its fearless tackling of social, political, artistic and philosophical aspects of the human condition.

If you've ever wondered what's wrong with the world, Rand lays it all bare in dramatic form. A writer and thinker of the first order, she belongs in the class of authors who have given the world masterpieces for the ages, like Victor Hugo, Dostoyevsky, Twain, Aristotle, Mencken, Dickens. Make no mistake: beneath its nearly science-fiction-like plot about a motor that is a new source of energy, this is a morality play. Her truth gores many an ox with her descriptions of moochers and looters in society--those who expect a free lunch and those who extort it for them through government force from the productive sectors. The film makers have stayed beautifully faithful to the novel's core messages while shortening its 1100 pages to what moviegoers are willing to sit through. Taylor Schilling is a fine embodiment of the heroine, Dagny Taggart, who tries to keep the transcontinental railroad her grandfather built from being destroyed.

I eagerly await the DVD release of Atlas Shrugged, Part Two, which arrived in theatres in 2012, even though it has an entirely new cast of actors. After all, how many actors have played James Bond, with full public acceptance? This story, and this film, is a one-of-a-kind historical and cultural event. For a book and film so vilified by its detractors, it is gratifying to know it is the highest-selling and most translated book after the Bible. You owe it to yourself to see it for yourself. Repeated viewings are recommended to appreciate the full depth of its tightly packed idealism, artistry and philosophical consistency.",1353369600,,2019,5.023880597014926

4843801,4,B005N4DMMG,I felt the movie followed the book very well.  It is scary how the story is so close to where we are in America today - how it is hard for business to make it because of Government regulations.  I found the movie very interesting.,1353283200,,230,4.088888888888889

4843809,1,B005N4DMMG,"It's tough to know where to begin with something this bad.

The best write-up that I saw for this and its ideas described it as what stupid people think a smart person sounds like. That's pretty damned accurate. Bad guys speak like bad guys and good guys speak like good ones. The ""philosophy"" (and I use the term very loosely here) of the psychopathic author is easily summed up as GIMME IT, IT'S MINE. I am quite thankful that the majority of the people on this good earth are rational enough to see this as little more than trite nonsense. Anyone who has read another book after becoming a teenager or who has had any number of broad experiences in the world would disregard the source material for this terrible film as complete trash. It's both laughable and sad that so many people believe in this nonsense and treat it as gospel.

As for the movie itself, it's worse than your old time Sunday night network movie. Hell, it's worse than public access. Calling the acting wooden is an insult to trees. If anything, it's only worth watching if you can turn it into some sort of drinking contest or laughing out loud and taunting it as it drags on. The only thing worse than a movie based on an Ayn Rand book is the actual Ayn Rand book. But hey, at least you could use that as a doorstop or to level out a coffee table.

Oh and spoiler alert, pretty much the entire cast bailed on and it was almost completely recast for part two. Very few people are aware of this fact, however, due to no one seeing part one. Even the most desperate of theaters drummed this in and out very quickly, which is the closest thing to any resemblance of capitalism that this movie or novel should be tied to.

Can't wait for part three to come out, reading critic reviews of parts one and two have had some of the most hilarious critiques of a bad film based on an even worse book that print has ever seen.",1353196800,8,1890,4.330508474576271

The most important points she was tryinng to make in her book - the individualism and anti-capitalism seems to be trivialized, if not downright sneered at.

4843841,4,B005N4DMMG,"Four stars is a little high, but given the content and message I rated it higher. the acting is on par with a good television movie, but since this is a big screen production one would expect more. (A caveat here: some of the minor charcters outshine their bigger part rivals, and steal the show. Watch it for yourself and see what I mean.)The special effects are also on-par with a good television movie, but sub-par for the big screen.

Where this films shines is its adaptation of Ayn Rands' classic. The story does a respectable job of updating to modern times, and at the same time sticking to the core elements of the plot. Even in a trilogy format, as this film series is, it is not possible to explore with depth the sub-plots of the story. In my opinion, it is in those sub-plots Ayn Rand expressed the power of the message of the book. I do feel, however, the film does a respectable job of catching the flavor of book.

As a stand alone film, aside from my earlier critisims, it is a good story. I watched it with two others that are not familiar with the book, and they were quickly drawn in.

Four stars to get the series going as Hollywood refused to make the movies because of the strong capitalist message it delivers.  It shows you how socialism kills the Producer classes that sustain a Big Government who regulate and tax them to extremes leading to the loss of jobs and innovative products we all desire. Most importantly it shows how the Takers expect the Producers to provide all their needs.  The Fair Share act takes Patents from the top Producers and gives them to those that don't have competitive products, it also limits the amount of companies any one individual can own. The Act sets quotas to make sure the less competitive can have a fair share of the sales available for a particuclar product or commodity.  Part 1 starts to show that only the companies motivated to make profits can actually produce the products needed to sustain what's left of the economy which is largely now Takers.  Private Sector Innovators, Artists, Leaders and Entrepreneurs begin to disappear and quit providing for the Takers.

4843871,5,B005N4DMMG,"I had found the book enjoyable and seminal -- despite minor shortcomings. (Length was a plus and minus; other bothers included logical problems with a few excerpts [probably necessary for a manageable size]; and the author's obvious fascination with the Marxian ""withering away"" of the state -- all come to mind.)

The makers did an excellent job of pulling the plot into a current-day context with their brief intro, and in selecting textual passages for inclusion in the screenplay.  The production values were amazingly high (photography, sound, cast, and well-integrated (though occasionally  visible) special effects.  (These folks had a story to tell, so the Space-Wars effects didn't have to be perfect to compensate for that shortcoming here.))

Overall the casting was amazingly good.  Two very slight shortcomings were fixed in Part-II, which aged Dagney and James (he's still too thin, tho), but Wesley Mouch was a perfect political fixer in Part 1.  He stole every scene he entered.  Orren Boyle (the ""other steel guy"") was also excellent.  Henry Reardon was also aged a bit in Part II, but the physical resemblance still showed amazingly strong continuity.

But this review addresses Part 1:  The chemistry of the two leads here was outstanding.  It simply worked; and the developing relationship was handled as tastefully as the original novel would allow... Both Dagney and Hank complemented each other marvelously.  (James, tho, was played as an idle meddler rather than as the developing force for evil in the novel.)

The Reardon Metal ""Staid Bridge"" design was fascinating, though even with the higher strength-to-weight ratio it hypothetically had over steel, it needed higher towers.  (They needed to be taller not only to give a sufficient vertical component to the center stayes -- which only produced a horizontal component in the movie -- but also to balance the overall horizontal component:  What held those short towers in place on the edge of the cliff?  Only movie maker's license, I fear.  Making the towers higher would have still looked good and made the bridge more of an Engineering Marvel rather than an obvious shortcoming (sorry for the pun).

I also actually liked the color choice for Reardon Metal.  In the novel it was green because of the copper.  But silver (literally) worked fabulously well.  Stunning ... and it would probably have required too much explanation for the green color anyway.

All in all the movie was fabulously well done.

I bought a Blue Ray 'cuz it was cheaper, and ended up having to find a solution to play it since I didn't (and don't) own a Blue Ray player.  Went out and got a B-R drive for my computer and simply watched it on that.  Worked great since I had a video controller card in the computer that supported DVI-D or HDMI.  And now I can burn higher density B-R disks to backup other stuff on my computer.  So, all-in-all a great choice for a Great Movie.  Ranks up there with the other classics of film.  We can all rejoice that this film -- and hopefully all its successors -- are there for posterity.

[Added thought: Also got an Amazon ""Instant Video"" with the blue ray purchase, which was great since I didn't have a player (q.v.).  But I have one suggestion for these folk:  You get a single 24 hour slot to view the instant video.  This caused some panic on my part.  Had to call in to make sure things worked, and got excellent help.  Amazon should provide a test set -- e.g. short shorts -- by default.  My second suggestion is that the rental be changed from unlimited viewing in 24 hours to something like 5 views over a few days -- at least 3 days, to give a good chance to test things, and preferably 7.  I think that would help, Amazon!  Unless you don't want to sell rentals in preference to hardware...]

Innovators, like Dagny and Henry Rearden are the Henry Ford and Steve Jobs in the story, creative,risk takers, job creators that work mega hours themselves yet they are attacked as the enemy. Any logical person watching will be puzzled by those like Wesley Mouch, who seek power at all costs for themselves and yet so cleverly convince ""The American Citizen"" that it is all for their welfare alone.

4843889,4,B005N4DMMG,"I loved the movie. The fact that the cast were mainly unknowns helped in that the story came through more strongly rather than the cast being the attention grabbers - great choice of actors. I have listened to Atlas Shrugged in it's entirety on audio book (50+hours on MP3 formatted discs) so I knew the story well. The movie faces a huge difficulty in relating the book's content in a reasonable manner. It did a fantastic job with the scenes it chose to showcase and the script was very true to the book's content so I was thoroughly pleased. I would certainly recommend this movie to others as I believe the message is poignant, however it definitely helps to read the book to better know what's going on and the full meaning behind the movie and it's characters. Great movie though - perhaps read reviews from those who had never read the book prior to watching the movie to get a better sense of the movie and how well it's message is successfully delivered if one is unfamiliar with the book and its content. The DVDs extra content on Ayn Rand is very beneficial too.",1351987200,,1073,4.507692307692308

4843891,4,B005N4DMMG,The movie was a slow start and because I had read the book I was able to follow it better. It is amazing that this was written in 1957 and yet is so prophetic today. It definitely is something every American should see and try to understand even though the story is deep and involved and somewhat confusing for a mass audience.  I am anxious to see part 2.,1351987200,,356,4.159420289855072

The only thing changed from the original books was a reference to the rail lines being so important because gas had gotten too expensive.  When the books were written, transcontinental trains still WERE the modern way to go.  That small change brought the book up to the present day without taking away anything from the experience.

I read Atlas shrugged several times in my 20's.  This movie was accurate enough that it took me back to my initial reaction to the book.  At the time, it was futuristic fantasy -- they've done a good enough job being true to the writings of Ayn Rand that the scenes portrayed are barely futuristic any more... they are terrifying glimpses of now.  Omg.. it was intense, very very good and most unsettling.  Must see for everyone.",1351814400,,817,4.664335664335664

However, considering the budget they had, the production team did a fantastic job of bringing the story to life. Schilling and Bowler and the rest of the cast did a fine job of acting. The timing of this film could not be more important with the economy in a shambles and the government asking for even more power. It gives you something to think about while still being entertaining.

The liberals were taking all they could, enriching themselves, drunk with power.  They were unable to see what they were doing to the country.  Socialism is great, until you run out of other people's money.  People were disappearing, not regular normal people.  No, the people,  that ran the country.  Where did they go, they just vanished.

It is hard to tell another person about this book.  It was interesting, exciting, you just couldn't get enough fast enough.  I had the cd version, so I wasn't reading.  I listened to the 10th disk several times.  The ending, when they were flying out of New York just made you gasp.  I tell people who ask about the story, read it first, then I will discuss it with you.  It is hard to explainn, unless you tell them it mirrors what is happening today.  Obama is destroying America and the wealth is disappearing.  How could this book be wriiten in 1957?

The movie was also good, but if I hadn't read the book first, I wouldn't have understtod the movie.  I am going to watch part one again and then part 2.  It would make a good book for school kids, required reading.",1351641600,,1234,4.5181818181818185

4843931,4,B005N4DMMG,"Some people may damn this film because it does not have ""A"" list celebs or fancy SFX, however, it is the message the film conveys, which is essential.  In 2016, America is a distopia wracked by massive unemployment, social upheaval, and astronomical fuel prices (e.g., gasoline is $37.00 per gallon). Airline travel is restricted due to fuel shortages and prices. Travel by automobile is economically unfeasible for long trips. The last remaining avenue for travel is via railroads, which are struggling due to fuel shortages, the poor conditions of tracks, and a lack parts for locomotives & rolling stock.

There are two groups of people in this film: the producers and the looters.  The ""producers (e.g., Ellis Wyatt, Dagney Taggert, & Hank Rearden)"" are brilliant people who are merely trying provide high-quality products or services using their own time, talent, & sheer grit; then there are the looters.  The ""looters"" range from the hangers-on (see Hank Rearden's wife, mother, brother, etc.) to James Taggert, the weak and ineffective president of Taggert Transcontinental Railroad (and brother of Dagney Taggert), who uses cronies like the despicable, snake-in-the-grass Washington insider Wesley Mouch to crush the his competition.  While the producers are simply trying to please their fellow citizens by producing superior products & services, the looters throw up roadblocks to those trying to pursue happiness.

Given whatever production shortcomings this indy film might have, one thing cannot be denied: its message that the solution to the human condition is liberty & free enterprise.

PS: ""Atlas Shrugged, Part 2"" was an outstanding production and I look forward to its release on DVD.

For ten years I worked as a fund raising manager for a statewide NPR network.  The last four years I've grown increasingly dismayed with the direction of the Democratic party.  It's interesting in the movie the caracters continue to ask who is John Galt?  Today I ask myself everyday who is Barack Obama or Barry Soretoro as he was known in his younger years.  When you look into Barack's or Barry's radical and communist past the movie makes you really think about the direction we are headed.  My fear is we are going to wake up and find America a very different place.  Once again I'm a concerned, once very liberal 47 year old man.  Please follow your heart when you step into the booth.  This movie, based on a book written many years ago, is a great look at what is possible if we take the freedoms we have for granted.  I would reccomend this movie to anyone who loves America.  Yes! there is a reason why we are the envy of the world.  It is not a bad thing to work hard and make yourself successful.

4843941,3,B005N4DMMG,"I struggle with this review.  I love the book and really wanted to love the movie.  It's not poorly done but it's just not as well done as it could have been.

First, the good points.  It appears that they spent some money.  I'm the farthest thing from an expert but the movie is well-filmed -- i.e. it doesn't feel low budget.  In addition, it's tremendously difficult to have an actor or actress pick up a classic role and expect them to meet everyone's expectations --i.e. everyone who has read the book has a picture in their mind's eye of what that person should look and act like.  In this case, I think they did a good job and I bought into the primary portrayal of the characters (Dagne Taggart and Hank Reardon come first to mind).  Not an easy feat.

Here's where it fell short:  If you've read the book, you understand what's going on.  If you haven't, I don't think you will get the true feel for what Rand was communicating to her readers.  The book calls out the insidious and infectious nature of socialism.  It does this by illustrating the unintended consequences of the many feel good policies imposed by a central authority when 'equality of outcome' is the highest priority.  I was hoping this movie could effectively communicate that message.  Unfortunately, I don't think enough time was spent developing the characters and the story line for the viewer to truly understand what was going on.  It delivers that message, but not in a way that does justice to the book.  It would seem that it was filmed for those that have read the book and can fill in the details.  I would've preferred that it provided the message in a way that those not exposed to Rand's work could understand and internalize the message.  There are plenty of current day examples of the empty promises provided by politicians that sound nice/fair/well-intentioned but ultimately destroy that which makes us great.

Note:  I will likely still watch the second installment because it's good enough to justify that.  I just feel like there was a missed opportunity to bring the current, younger generation into the fold.  I believe there are many who need to hear this message.  It's not perfect but it's a lot better than what they are currently being fed.",1351555200,,2247,4.659033078880407

4843962,4,B005N4DMMG,"The movie could have had a nice 1930's 1940's appeal to it. Trying to insert special ""techno effects"" like large industrial complexes and trains barrelling down futuristic landscapes and infrastructure was a waste.
There should have been way more character development and scenes more akin to Bogart and Gable for the leading men.
Some of the scenes seemed to be taken from a distance. More intimate filming would have been nice.
Some of the actors gave noteworthy performances but the scenes seemed to be way too short to grasp anything from the dialogue.
Maybe I just didn't get it, but I had to wait for the dvd to come out to see this movie and missed the big screen spectacle.  There wasn't one theater within 2,500 miles of Hawaii showing it when it was on the big screen. Part two is being passed on also by the Theaters in Hawaii.
I might have enjoyed it a little better on the big screen but sometimes you have to make compromises.
In any event the movie was a lot better than most of the movies Hollywood puts out. When you consider the budget restrictions it was a very good movie. There were no big named stars or sexy celebrities.
Knowing that I have to wait for Part 2 to come out on dvd is a shame. Knowing that the cast is a whole new cast is very disturbing too. I think Sammantha Mathis is the most under rated actress of our times (see her in THE THING CALLED LOVE with River Phoenix, Dermot Mulroney, Sandra Bullock where she is the memorable one) and I might risk buying the part two video when it comes out for this reason.",1351382400,,1545,4.4020979020979025

The real problem here is that the written word, however impressive, does not translate well when spoken by actors. This is especially true on film where the characters are set free of the boundaries of print or the stage. Atlas is a philosophical statement surrounded by a story. The movie tries hard to portray the philosophy by quoting the characters.as written. It is a noble effort, but it really doesn't, work very well.
The result is heavy and rather lifeless. Anyone who hasn't read the book is probably going to get lost in the story pretty early on. Better read the book instead.

It harkens back to the old days of Hollywood, no computer graphics (or very little in this case) so the actors had to do it all. I loved it so much I went out to see Atlas Shrugged Part 2 at the theater. I was super disappointed at the beginning as the actors were different (the key actors in Part 1 went on to fame and the studio could no longer afford them/scheduling conflicts) but again I ended up being highly impressed - they found another group of exceptional actors.

""Atlas Shrugged Part One"" continues Howard Roark's struggle through the persons of Dagny Taggert and Henry Rearden where this time the conformists are so politically connected at the state and national levels that they not only want to crush the very innovations that would bring increased prosperity to the American people through the efforts of persons such as Dagny and Henry, but are willing to collapse the economy and there by plunging all of us into the economic abyss to do it.

This film comes close to the present economic peril we all face.

I fully intend to buy the second part when the DVD becomes available.  If part II is as good as part I, it will be well worth it.  After all, if you approve of capitalism, why wouldn't you buy it if you like it?  Don't let some soreheads with a different agenda and a different philosophy impose their opinions on you.  Who made them the sole possessors of wisdom?  The last four years under the idiotic liberal regime in Washington and the main stream media have made a skeptic of me and I believe that is a good thing.  It has made me think.  It has made me stop and realize that words are cheap.  It has taught me to recognize BS when I hear it and, believe you me, there is plenty of it flying around these days.

Although the novel occupies a place in my bookshelf, I have never tackled its 1168 pages.  I have, however, read the Cliffs Notes version so I am cognizant of the central ideas of the novel.  And before some sorehead sneers at that revelation, let me say that generations of high school and college students have utilized Cliff Notes (and Sparknotes).  They successfully get the main ideas across and omit the drudgery.  If you disagree with that, then give me facts and not opinions.  I will listen to facts and if you have the right of it, then I will re-evaluate my thinking.

Some of the special effects in part I were quite good.  I especially liked the views of the speeding train and the awesome bridge spanning the Colorado canyon.  And the entire cast did a good job.  Every character, however obnoxious, was believable.  I repeat, it was an enjoyable movie.

I am glad to see Atlas Shrugged at long last appear as a first class movie.  It has been wrongfully censured and suppressed for too long.",1351036800,,1860,4.390029325513196

I loved the movie eve though it was panned by the critics.  I expect their agenda is different from the agenda in the movie, which is to show what happens when you have a country in which a large number of people become dependent upon government at the expense of the producers.

4844028,3,B005N4DMMG,"I'll admit, this movie was better than I expected.  I'm giving it three stars because it's worth watching if you read the book, whether you liked it or not.  I can't imagine you would want to watch the movie if you didn't read the book, but if you do, at least read the Wikipedia article, so you know what all the hype's about.  By and large, the movie is very faithful to the book, and that's both its strength and its weakness.

First and foremost, there's the setting.  We're told the story takes place in 2016, but everything looks a lot the when the book was written, or maybe even a few years earlier. All the men wear suits and often hats, the women wear retro dresses and heavy makeup, and it looks like in four years people will start to get a lot of their information from newspapers again.  A little modern technology creeps in, but it doesn't really affect anything.  There are cell phones, but no texts, the occasional computer screen, but no one attempts to just google ""Who is John Galt?"".  Most importantly, trains and the steel industry are really important again (??).  They try to explain this with high fuel prices, but that would drive freight and commuter lines, not interstate passenger trains.  Whatever the reason, you just have to accept that Dagny's rail line and Hank's new steel appear to be the biggest news items of 2016.  I guess that means we won't have reality TV by then, and that at least is something.

Don't get me wrong, I find the anachronistic atmosphere the biggest charm of the movie, but it gives it more the feel of an alternate history set in the 50s than a cautionary tale about a plausible future.

All in all, the casting is good and the acting is decent, but again they're shackled to the book. If characters appear wooden and two dimensional, it's because that's how they were written. If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you *loved* the book, you'll *love* the movie.  That explains the split between the reviews by critics and the audience.  The critics had to see the movie, while the audience is a largely self-selecting group, predisposed to enjoy it.

Personally, I always got the feeling that Rand considered readers somewhat thick. so rather than simply relying on the story to convey her rather obvious message, she insisted on having her characters forever launch into mini (or not so mini) lectures and non-sequitur conversations to further clarify her worldview - as if it needed clarification.  This kind of works in a book, where the line between dialog and narration can be blurred, but in the movie, I got the feeling the actors were rushing through the requisite sermons to keep them from dragging the pace even more than they already were.

For all the reverent adherence to the book, I was a little surprised that the makers got a bad case of cold feet when it came to Rand's trademark rough sex imagery and decided to omit it entirely.  In the book, there's a smoldering passion between Hank and Dagny that culminates (like all Rand's ""love"" scenes) in a near rape.  In the movie, there's very little sexual chemistry between these characters, and when they finally consumate their relationship, it's in a scene so tepid that it wouldn't raise eyebrows in an ABC After School Special. It struck me that if Rand were alive today, that lukewarm love scene might be her biggest - and possibly only - complaint about the movie.

Don't expect this movie to stand on its own. It just stops.  The makers clearly intend to make all three and expect you to see them all.  Luckily, I expect them all to appear on video/Netflix soon after they're released.

I'm not an Ayn Rand sycophant, but I think she had some important things to say.  I believe that Atlas Shrugged could have been made into a decent movie by modernizing the plot and shortening it to something appropriate to its simple and straightforward message.  Through their religious devotion to the book, the makers have created something of a novelty.  Definitely worth watching if you read the book, but unlikely to be as world shaking as they clearly hoped.",1350604800,6,4096,4.652777777777778

This is the chief example of a tome that must be read prior to viewing the movie adaptation.

The book plainly has too much going on in order for it to transition to the silver screen and make sense to an audience that has not read it. The little touches that are there throughout the movie will be completely missed by those not familiar with the work.

Recasting of the performers, particularly Francisco, was needed. Keeping Schilling as Dagny would have been best, for continuity if for no other reason, for parts II and III.

4844031,5,B005N4DMMG,"Watching ""Atlas Shrugged"" is nothing dissimilar at ALL to watching the 6 O'Clock news on any given evening.  We Christians see this as the Books of Daniel and Revelations coming true, and fully expect to hear that trumpet blow, literally any minute now.  And some (evidentally) ""ex-hippie"" sorts believe that the end cometh this December 21, either by the sun sort of ""breaking wind"" and incinerating the earth, or (this one is good!) ""naughty alien reptiles"" conquering the earth.  Myself, I tend to disagree on that point - I mean, who are YOU to make conjecture as to when God is gonna say, ""Blow the trumpet, Gabriel, I can't deal with them any longer.""  ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a rather secular conjecture about the ""end of time,"" infinitely more believable than the ""naughty alien"" thing.  In truth, though, I found ""Atlas Shrugged"" more akin to Fritz Lang's 1926 masterpiece, ""Metropolis,"" you know, that riff about those who ""have,"" and those who ""want it"" - except when Georgio Moroder got hold of ""Metropolis"" in, what, '84? he increased its value exponentially by adding sound, color, and that freaking BRILLIANT music!

4844036,4,B005N4DMMG,"There is so much meat in the book, so much back story, and so much character delineation, that it would take a truly extraordinary script writer to capture the depth and power in a visual medium.  First, there is the problem of capturing the key moments in each character's back story and weaving them into the ""now"" part of the story so that the audience has a chance to see both what the character's see and what confuses them.

Then there is the problem of finding actors who are not only so solidly grounded in their craft to project Rand's characters accurately and honestly but also so thoroughtly familiar with the book and the backstories for the characters that they are able to get into the heads of the characters and show the audience what they are truly thinking and feeling.

When I first saw the film in the theater, as a devotee of the novel, I was somewhat disappointed.  However, I just watched it again and was amazed at how well this first section of the novel was captured - even more powerfully than I had at first imagined. Paul Johansson did an amazing job of directing.  The cast did a terrific job of capturing the amazing archetypical characters as very real people.

Of course, people who are caught up in today's class warfare environment so ardently pushed by our politicians and the desire for the government to take care of everyone and everything, will hate this film.  They will pick it apart, and, yes, like all films, it has its weaknesses.  They will find every reason to hate it, ridicule it and the philosophy behind it.

But as you watch it, it will floor you that the book was published in 1957.  Why?  Because what is happening in the film with regard to the economy and the government's approach to dealing with it is on the news every day.  Even as we watch Greece's riots and deterioration, our government's response is to replicate the precise actions that got Greece, and those countries also coming apart, in that predicament in the first place.

4844041,5,B005N4DMMG,"Having looked through the mass of official press criticism of this film, I come away feeling that the vast majority of print reviewers are more guided by the need to slight the film on political grounds, and denigrate the rest of it in diatribes utterly uncalled-for and inaccurate. I would go further and suggest that these guilty parties have probably not had much more contact with the original source, the novel, other than perhaps from some underground Cliff notes written by some manner of left-wing loon who also likely did not read the novel (but heard about it from some community organizer type politician).

That said, such comments about the film, and as the basis for review of an artistic effort are inaccurate and unacceptable precisely because of their common political position. Such reviews sink to same sewer level as the majority of our so-called mainstream media which, in viewing the general public as hopelessly stupid and, therefore corruptible, can completely throw off its public responsibility (...) to remain neutral in all matters political and stick solely to the facts accurately reported.

As to Ayn Rand's work - the simple minded leftists in our midst will find the book far too detailed in the exposition of its ""objectivist"" philosophy. That Rand was an atheist is something which I, as a religious man, can not easily swallow - however, that aside, her basic premise is sound and is eerily prescient. Its various concepts and dialogues are with us to day in our current political climate in a way that must have seemed improbable in the USA of 1957. However, bearing in mind that Rand was raised under Stalinism, her polemic was, and remains a clear warning of the dangers of political tyranny and its economic, social and cultural consequences. She saw the early signs and responded in kind.

The film does more than an adequate job of providing a neat and clean summary of the novel's first part. That it glosses over some things, omits others and truncates or otherwise finds redaction necessary is hardly anything new in cinema. One reads Lord of the Rings, and then goes to Peter Jackson's films and recognizes immediately that the novel has been reduced to a series of verbal grunts and snippets with all of Tolkein's poetry completely removed and replaced with unending visual spectacle. In my opinion, the two bear only the most tangential relationship to each other. LOTR, the film, is either a cruel redaction of a great piece of linguistic virtuosity, or a visually spectacular fantasy loosely based on Tolkein's mythology. To have left Rand's often extremely lengthy speeches intact would have produced a movie easily four or five hours long - something not unusual in Soviet cinema but rarely encountered in American films.

Atlas Shrugged - Part I, the movie, is not a visual fantasy - it is rather a thoughtful and extremely dense drama which, in the course of its 98 minutes can barely give the outline of the first third of the 1100 page novel. It is, however, done tastefully - its dialogue is drawn freely but accurately from Rand's novel (redactive creation notwithstanding), the use of little known actors a brilliant stroke forcing viewers to concentrate on ideas and not on screen personalities. Part II, just released, has a completely different cast than Part I.

Rand's message has little to do with ""free market capitalism"" in the sense that our left-wing useful idiots would have you believe. It's central message concerns the right of the creator to profit from his creation because he created it, he put in the effort to create it, he acquired the knowledge and skill to create it, and is therefore the only one entitled to reap its benefits. Those whom he employs to help him accomplish his creation are paid solely according to their skill and ability. This is why we have the legal concepts and constructs of copyright and patent together with the legal mechanisms to enforce the rights of the creator. Rand's whole argument is against those who would force a man to give up what is his own creation in the face of threats and actual intellectual theft that is the power of a corrupted legal system justifying what in any other circumstance would be called robbery under the guise of ""the greater good."" Our useful idiots scream bloody murder when their ideas are co-opted by others. Curious, then, how when it comes to THEIR work, they evolve rapidly into John Galt - but when it comes to something they WANT, but did nothing to produce, then John Galt becomes an enemy of the people (and how quintessentially Stalinist is that, eh?). In the end, it is a study of hypocrisy gone global to the detriment of everyone. The film, in its own quiet way, makes its case simply and without any of the hyperbole common in much of our otherwise mindless cinema",1350259200,2,4821,4.845873786407767

The special effects in Part 2 detract rather than add to the quality.

The entire casts were different between the two films, and the cast for part 1 was more authentic and natural. Taylor Schilling started the film a bit uncertain of her role as Dagny, but grew into the role by the end. The dialogue was elegantly austere, with less talk and more acting.

After part 1, my wife and I left the theater excited and relieved that they had somehow managed to capture the true message of the book without sacrificing artistic beauty and flow.

Regardless if your political leanings are Left or Right - this is a MUST SEE movie for all Americans.  The book was a very tough read in parts, but the movie helps put things in perspective.  There's already TOO much government control in our lives.  If we continue to allow the government to take more and more from us (not only in the form of taxes, but more importantly, our liberties and freedom), this movie, along with Atlas Shrugged Part II, illustrates the clear path we're on.  I can't wait for Part III to come out!  People...stand up and have a voice.  We have to slow the growth of government and get back to allowing people to control their own destinies.

4844050,5,B005N4DMMG,"I've heard so much about the book and was anxious to see the movie when it came out.  But the awful movie reviews made me think it was something I wouldn't want to see.  They made it sound like the author glorified self-centered narcissism in a capitalistic ideology on steroids.  I can't believe I actually believed that's what it would be about based on movie reviews from critics who are largely liberal.

The main point of this movie is that when people are allowed to pursue their dreams and seek their best interests(in legal ways) end up benefiting all.  Those willing to take the risks and give their lives for a vision reap the majority of the benefits but those who are willing to work in support of that vision benefit as well.  However when government comes in to try to guaranty equality of outcome not opportunity, then success must be punished and failure rewarded.  Resulting in the economic disaster that we are heading towards and is the opening setting of this movies.

Sadly the liberal critics are of the mindset of the government running the nation at the start of this movie, so the value of this movie is completely lost on them.

The reality of this move is that it does an amazing job of showing how government under the auspices of the common good destroys industries, societies and ultimately nations, which of course is NOT for the good of the individual.  It's truly heart breaking to see the few entrepreneurs who are left trying to save their industries and ultimately the nation with the government doing everything it can to trample on success and bolster up failure.

It's tragic to see how this book written way back in the 50's was so insightful to see where this once great nation was heading at the time and is now close to arriving at.  How sad that so many people with only a passing interest in the fate of their nation have bought the bylines that those who have created our economic woes are best equipped to solve it.  The solutions of the governing class in this movie and ours are presenting ""solutions"" to our problems that are equivalent to throwing fuel on the fire and they are too ignorant to figure out why the fire of economic destruction won't go out.

It's interesting how people think the story of robin hood was about stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.  No Robin hood was taking from the government who stole from the people and giving back to the people impoverished by the government.  Interesting that those who are trying to co-opt the robin hood legend are actually playing the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham.

The occupy movement has no clue that the life they think is so unfair now will be just a fantasy in the future if we continue on this path.

4844052,4,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged Part I is a good movie and a decent adaptation of is source material, Ayn Rand's 1957 novel. The acting is decent, especially Grant Bowler as Hank Rearden, Jsu Garcia as Francisco D'anconia, Michael Lerner (excellent) as Wesley Mouch, and Graham Beckel as Ellis Wyatt. Production values are on par with high end TV movies.

Some harsh reviews of the movie contain overtly political, anti-Rand and anti-conservative rants. Given the leftist slant of Hollywood in general, and Hollywood's embrace of Barack Obama, it's reasonable to assume that political considerations taint most of the criticism of this film.

""Atlas Shrugged"" is a timely reminder of the devastation caused by totalitarian socialism, which Ayn Rand experienced firsthand as Alisa Rosenbaum during and after the 1917 Communist Russian Revolution. Her novels and essays have demonstrated predictive value, as Barack Obama's crusade for ""fundamental change"" continues to attack the individualism, freedom, and opportunity that has characterized America for two centuries.

4844063,3,B005N4DMMG,"Perhaps in this case, reading the book first could only guarantee being lead to movie disappointment.  Among other reasons, I especially speak of the thread throughout the book from the point of discovery of the mysteriously abandoned motor invention by Dagny Taggert,  strewn amongst the ruins of the Wisconsin auto factory.  It was an integral binding thread of the novel, seemingly dismissed by movie writers, directors, and producers.  In the movie, Hank Rearden takes the credit--has the discovery of it's wonder--as if he would have been more knowledgeable or intuitive than the woman with whom by then he was sleeping with.

Minute or moot point?  Nit-picky on my part? Absolutely not.  Hank was nowhere to be found in the long time she spent alone, ripping up her nylons and clothes to salvage what she knew represented intellectual greatness. It kept Dagny going not only to gather every scrap of evidence until spent and bloody, it kept her on the search for the mind of the inventor, all based upon everything she thought she stood for--her philosophical moral/ethical values placed in action.

Mentally, at the moment of Hank's so-called discovery being theatrically promoted instead, well...that's when I dismissed the movie and had to force myself to watch the rest.

I also object vehemently to Wyatt Ellis's character (or perhaps his utter heathen behavior, beneath that of even the wildest west cowboy or derrick builder), but okay--that I could have accepted far easier if that had been the only faux pas and disservice to this masterpiece of literary fiction.  I won't even bother about the Tagget brother's character--not nearly sniveling, sneaky or brown-nosing enough.

Sigh.  In retrospect I suppose (quite dejectedly said): how could a movie only this long for Part 1 even so much as hope to cover even a small sliver of the depth of characters? The worst of it is: without it, if you've never read 'Atlas Shrugged' you're left wondering about the passions and persistence of some of the characters--and you lose the entire point of the original novel.

Part 1 could have stood on it's own merits to be a mini-series in and of itself.  Better yet: a series developed for PBS Masterpiece Classic, with the USA finally giving the BBC a run for their romantic-past money.

Actually, the first in-your-face mistake was to try to manipulate the time period in which Rand wrote, yet keeping the same tangible idea of it being trains and railroads.  I may be too much of a by-gone era purist who can actually still remember riding the rails pulled by cool art deco locomotives, but were it me,  I'd have left Rand's masterpiece alone, to stand where it was frozen in a time of aging industrialism and operator-assisted phone lines.  Something will *always* be ""wanting"" in this movie production because of the attempt to pull the story only half-way into the present.

4844072,5,B005N4DMMG,"When this movie came out and it got low critical reviews, I wondered why? The base material, Rand's novel, was certainly intriguing enough, and from what I saw of the trailers, this movie looked very good.

Now that I have seen part 1 (the book was so long, to do it justice they have to make the movie in several parts) I have to say I am hooked and will eagerly look for the subsequent parts.

To start with, it is an intriguing story, part mystery, part sci-fi, and heavy social commentary. The characters are very strong, and the only down side is a bit of naivet&eacute; on Rand's part about how easily a government can be corrupted by misplaced altruism (although in the movie it is really corporate shenanigans to beat each other out of the market) and how blameless and honorable fiercely independent capitalists are (which history has proved may not always be the case).

That was Rand's perspective and the movie seems to be faithful to her vision, which is great -- because movies should be faithful to their source material.

So, if you have problems with the philosophy or politics of the movie, look to the original author and not the film. The film is being faithful.

Instead, enjoy this film for the breadth and scope of the grand adventure it displays. It delivers plenty of eye candy -- and some food for thought.

I have read Atlas Shrugged -- as a book it is a bargain because it is so LONG! You get your money's worth with an engrossing story that goes on and on. The movie follows suit quite nicely.

I won't go over the complex plot, but will point out what I think makes this a valuable film:

1. It follows the book very closely. Things you like and don't like about the book are here pretty much as the author intended, so the emotional impact is as strong in the film as it is in the novel.

2. The production values are high. I have read it was a low budget movie, but it certainly appeared high budget to me. For one thing we see how the rich and ""famous""--  or infamous... take your pick depending on the character -- live and ""hang out"". Everything in the scenery, makeup, and effects look very genuine and believable.

3. The movie, like the book, maintains a good level of suspense. Will Reardon Metal fail? Will the John Galt Line succeed in its first run? What is the mysterious ""super engine"" prototype and who created it? Having read the book, I know the answer and I won't give it away here. Suffice it to say, when we find out, there is a definite emotional experience to it.

4. The actors are all very good, and there are a few easily recognizable character actors as well as some new comers. As for their characters -- the good guys are reasonably good, and the bad guys are reasonably slimy. But be warned, Rand's villains often come off stronger than her heroes in that they engender a stronger emotional reaction. This movie follows that line of thinking.

5. The musical score and soundtrack are excellent. Appropriate volume (nicely equalized) and they avoid the clich&eacute; of musical clashes to alert the audience when something unexpected is about to happen. Nice job.

6. Because this is a bit of a hi-tech story (the new metal, the new designs for bridges and other technological advances) they need some CGI effects to pull it off. When we see the new John Galt ""super"" train, it really does look super! I'm a sucker for trains anyway, and to see this neat high speed rail line, even as CGI, was very exciting. It was even more so because much of the second half of the movie is filmed in Colorado with amazing natural vistas and beautiful skylines. This could have been a travel film, the natural scenery was photographed so well.

------------------------------

Conclusion:

If you want to see a movie that is refreshingly close to the original source (with all its benefits and faults), a film that has a ""rich"" look to it, a film that has suspense, mystery a bit of sci-fi or at least high tech, and some really good looking actors doing a great and believable job, then I think you will enjoy this film.

4844075,5,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged, part 1 played in only ONE Theater in a hundred mile radius in the greater LA area.  There was ZERO marketing, and the reviewers all killed it with uniform wording (read, a ""talking points"" distribution sheet.)  If one is a ""Progressive"" big government Democrat, one hates this movie by definition.  The theater I was in was completely full, every seat.  There was applause-long applause- at the end of the movie. I had read ""Atlas Shrugged,"" so knew about the plot. However, the movie was structured so that one did not need to read the book to understand the movie. Hollywood did their best to ignore this movie.

PRO:  The plot is excellent and the screenplay well done.  The visuals, especially the 200 mph train riding on high speed unique metal rails is spectacular.  The new alloy steel is SO GOOD, the government decides to nationalize the production facilities.  Society is collapsing due to government growth and severe control of businesses.  Ayn Rand saw the effect of the Soviet Communists firsthand, and echoed her revulsion of their policies in her book.

CON:  The acting is interesting but not Oscar caliber.  The budget for the movie was not lavish, as it was ""blackballed"" by Hollywood for many years so its amazing it was ever made at all. Kudos to the producers.  Also, the overall Ayn Rand philosophy makes no provision for belief in God, or helping others voluntarily.  Only transactional relationships are involved, which is a flaw, and a result of Rand's upbringing in the Soviet Union.

A few favorite things from the book left out, but that usually happens with large books.  This one only deals with part 1 which itself is equal to a large book.

Just a few minor things keep me from giving it 5 stars.  I would give it 4 and a half if I could.  Some parts I wish were slowed down a bit for emphasis were rushed I suppose to keep the movie brisk.  Done well I think that could have contributed to an increasing rush as things increasingly fail as more and more 'equality' takes over.

Further, I also suspect that many haven't seen it and wrote negatively about it to discourage others from doing so.  Those who have passed on it have missed a very good film.  Be warned that the message the story conveys is everything. The acting is quite good and the camera work is excellent.  There is spectacular scenery and the special effects are seamless and set design is well done.  Atlas Shrugged is a difficult story to tell on film but I believe this is a very good effort.  It wasn't in any of the theaters in my area in its initial release and, given that Part 2 is due for release next week, I wanted to see Part 1, so I bought the BluRay disc.

My hardcover copy of the book is 1168 pages long and delves deeply into the author's political philosophy, which is particularly pertinent at this moment in 2012.  The DVD is the first of a three DVD set which attempts to present Rand's message in an entertaining and necessarily abbreviated format.  For those who simply will not read a book, the DVD is better than nothing.  For serious students of politics, philosophy, capitalism, objectivism, etc, the book is a MUST READ!!!  For those who have read the book, the DVDs will be an entertaining refresher of the basic ideas but much of the author's underlying message will likely be missed by viewers unfamiliar with the book.

4844082,5,B005N4DMMG,"I was skeptical about how well a book as epic in scope as Atlas Shrugged could be translated into film, but the cast and crew do an outstanding job of it.  My lone complaint would be that the villians of the movie, especially James Taggart, come across as somewhat likable, if misguided, characters, instead of the mouthpieces for a pervasive evilness that threatens not only the book's heroes, but any and all indivduals who value freedom.  The actor portraying James Taggart was poorly chosen -- frankly, he's too handsome for the role.  But the few shortcomings of the film are more than overshadowed by the success of the translation, which while not remaining totally faithful to the book, taking place in an unspecified future, wasn't changed for change's sake.  The update makes sense and while a period piece would also have been enjoyable, I have no complaints about the way the script was written.",1349049600,2,907,4.87012987012987

4844091,3,B005N4DMMG,"I would love to see Atlas Shrugged as an HBO or Showtime series, e.g. 15 90-minute episodes.  Often the movie felt like a political propaganda film.  But the Dagny and Rearden actors were great, and the plot didn't drag; it moved along pretty well.  Unfortunately the time constraint meant that a lot was cut from the novel.  Dagny's meetings with Robert Stadler and Hugh Akston, which are dramatic and memorable in the novel, are rather ordinary and boring in the movie.  I must admit that after being familiar with the novel for 40 years, I can't say how the movie would look to someone who hadn't read the novel.  But there is the feeling of Cliff Notes, that the movie touches upon this scene and that scene, with not enough time to draw us in.

The movie is fairly close to the novel, but unavoidably gives less insight into her characters' drives and feelings. The novel was published in 1957--a time when our government had only slightly increased in size and power and was far smaller than the maze of bureaus, and departments that today tell us what light bulbs to use, how our cars and trucks are to be built and what food we should eat. The story is told through the experiences of Dagny Taggert, operating chief of Taggert Intercontinental Railway. When you see it, you would think that Ayn Rand had some magical crystal ball, for the story she told in 1957 predicts the intrusive government that we have today and its methods to gain total control of individuals' lives and private businesses.

I have never read the book.

This was a great movie and I'm eagerly awaiting part 2. The characters were compelling, the story and pace kept me on the edge of my seat. The video quality, cinematography, and effects were superb. This is not a simple, feel-good typical hollywood type of production. You will not likely know or have ever heard of the key actors/actresses in this movie. What it is is a movie which tells a story of a rare few people who dare to stand up for their ideals. This should speak to the mind of any thinking human being.

I am generally aware of Rand's philosophies and I disagree with important aspects of her ideas. I'm not a fan. I'm not concerned with being ""brainwashed"" by her ideas, and I'm not concerned about my sense of ""nationalism"" or patriotism being tarnished or challenged by seeing this movie. Quite the opposite, in fact; any real patriot should be able to appreciate the message this story is trying to put across, and take what they want away from it. I judge things based on their own merit.  The poor box-office performance and vehemently scathing reviews this movie has received only speak of its importance, and those who are threatened by it.

Any intellectual or individual capable of independent thought will appreciate this movie.

Any corporate executive worth his bonus knows how to hire lobbyists and influence law making.  It's called ""regulatory capture"", look it up. Watch  ""Tucker, a man and his dream"" and Howard Hughes who was squeezed out by competitor airlines capturing the regulatory agencies...and neither of these stories are crappy fiction.

Is Ayn Rand trying to tell us that Tagget and Reirden designed the bridge themselves? Where's the civil engineers, Materials engineers, model builders, CAD designers, environmental engineers and umpteen other people who make this happen?  Tagget and Reirden were too stupid to send the metal for lab testing to determine integrity but they rode the train across their bridge.  Would you want Dagny and Ellis designing a roller coaster for you?  What about liability to the corporation or even killing people? Oh yeah they probably tort reformed that out and that's why we don't hear anything about courts.

What about the environmental impact of the project? Worker Safety? Are their workers making enough $ that they're all happy? Hec I want to work for that company.

Where's all the engineers and scientists who designed, tested and built the particle accelerator? Middle management just blew the Popsicle stand because they weren't getting their bonuses and the company shut down?  When does that happen in real life?  Didn't the business owner have enough brains to file for bankruptcy, sell off the accelerator and assets like they would do today?  What kind of stupid executives are these?

Ellis Reirden, doesn't use the corporate law to consolidate his companies? What planet is this guy on?

There is no ""State Science"" department in the US.  The EPA doesn't even classify as a ""State Science"" department. If it was that powerful, why is the air so polluted in Los Angeles?  The rivers and bays full of junk killing fish and people getting sick?  The Navy is even conducting tests that kill whales!  Where's the state Science Department to save us today!

When do corporate executives go on strike without their stock holders freaking?  Tony Stark couldn't even do that!

Matter of fact these executives are barely knowledgeable enough to run a mini-mart. They're all fired!

Ayn Rand writes these stories as if we're back in Communist Russia and she's working at her parents little grocery store? She has no clue how the corporations have established law in the US and through-out the world so that they can have favorable conditions to run their businesses.

A novel, it was claimed foretold the sinking of the titanic and it also seems that Atlas Shrugged has foretold the failure of a nation.

The only reason I gave it one two stars instead of one is because it is not as pathetic as The Fountainhead starring Gary Cooper in the worst performance of his otherwise great career.

I would be amazed if Part 2 is ever made. The whole story is based on what uneducated people in the '50s, when the novel was written, might have thought was possible. The Reardon Metal railroad rails are no more convincing than the North Korean ""missiles"" which were so flimsy that they shook in the wind.

It is obvious that the film was made as political propaganda since the makers made no attempt to use realistic technology. Why not say aluminum rails? The rails in the construction scene were so flimsy they swayed in the wind. But they support a train traveling 250 mph.

I've seen Part I on DVD at least seven times.  If you haven't watched it, it...is...awesome!

It occurred to me recently that this country really has two modern traditions: FDR's and Ronald Reagan's.  (An even more libertarian situation, as Bill Buckley would have envisioned, would be preferable.)  The FDR half of the country thinks the private sector is infinitely wealthy and greedy, and will always be here.  It does not understand how it sets up obstacles and ultimately impoverishes itself by hobbling the producers.

The Reagan half understands that this country is killing itself, and that you can't make yourself better by tearing down someone else.

I wish everyone in America would see this movie, but I've also learned that people either don't understand what they are looking at, or they reject it.  When I taught high school, in the same class, I'd have two kids: the first would be hard working and cheerful.  She would make excellent grades.  The next would be lazy and a complainer, with an aggrieved sense of victimization.  She would make terrible grades and then yell at the other kids.  One day, it blew my mind to realize: she has a perfect model sitting two desks over, and everything she needs is already present for her.  She was looking right at exactly what she said she wanted.  And she...missed it.

That's our world.  ""Atlas Shrugged I"" is one of the original warnings.  The film is fantastic.  I hope each segment in the film series attains a gigantic audience.

I became familiar with Ayn Rands books through authors such as F. Paul Wilson and L. Neil Smith. Many aspects of Libertarianism appeals to me through their works. I was searching through upcoming movies and I was shocked to see that atlas shrugged pt 2 was coming out soon, since I had not heard that they had even done the first movie. I immediately jumped on Netflix and checked to see if they had it, and when I saw that they did I sat down to watch it. So to keep a short story long here is my review. AMAZING!!!! The movie was compelling owing to a faithful adaptation of the book set in the near future. I was able to quote multiple lines from just the few bits that I had read from my earlier attempts. The CGI was excellently done for a movie with such a relatively small budget. The acting was very well done and casting was spot on. The reviews by the critics were understandable as the theme appeals to a narrow audience, mostly those people who feel that the individual human being is just as important if not more important than the whole of humanity. As for the reviewers that feel the critics were being unprofessional by allowing their personal,  cultural, and ideological bias to give this movie such a low rating all I can say is that you are correct. You should not be surprised however as you can see it everywhere around you from commercials to politicians and teachers to media talents. It is your responsibility as a critical thinking individual to wade through this bias and educate people who are not so entrenched in their beliefs that a human being is nothing more than a dumb animal interchangeable with any other. So do not waste your time criticizing the critics instead do something productive ask a family member or friend to watch it with you. Who knows you might free someones mind.

4844136,4,B005N4DMMG,"For those of you who have never read Atlas Shrugged:

This is a pretty good adaptation of the first third of Ayn Rand's masterwork.  That's saying a lot, because Atlas Shrugged the book is a huge, incredibly dense and verbose novel that many people have tried and failed to film over the past half-century. John Aglialoro and Harmon Kaslow not only succeeded in bringing (part of) it to the screen, but kept it reasonably faithful to the book AND did it all on a tiny budget by Hollywood standards.  (And it now appears we'll be seeing parts 2 and 3 in 2012 and 2013 - more on this later.)

Now, that said: If you haven't read the book, Part One is not going to impress you.  The first part of the novel (which is, not coincidentally, written in three parts) is almost all character development and foreshadowing, and the movie is pretty much the same.  We get to know one Dagny Taggart, railroad executive in a world where gas prices have skyrocketed and rail transport is once again vital to commerce, and Hank Rearden, steel magnate who has just started to commercialize a new super-alloy that promises to revolutionize the industry.  Taggart, Rearden, and a number of other industry leaders we meet in the course of the movie are overachievers; supremely competent, dedicated and successful, and just beginning to struggle to remain so in a society that is growing increasingly hostile toward the ""fortunate few,"" moving ever more rapidly toward outright class warfare.  (Sound familiar?)  They are also puzzled and growing alarmed that, over the course of the movie, their colleagues are going missing, one by one.  Their wealth is either disappearing with them or being destroyed, apparently by their own hands.  We also see hints of a shadowy figure who is somehow involved with these disappearances.

That's pretty much it.  There are some decent dramatic moments, well-detailed sets, a good, understated soundtrack, and a CGI-heavy sequence of the first run of a new, beyond-state-of-the-art rail line that is amazingly good given the bargain-basement budget, but the plot is almost entirely about establishing the good guys and bad guys, and laying the groundwork for the stark divide between the Makers and Takers that will hit the fan in parts 2 and 3.  If you've read the book, this is a nice setup.  If you haven't, it's... well... dull.

And you should watch it anyway.  Why?  Because if Aglialoro and Kaslow continue to stay close to the novel (and there's no reason to think that they won't,) the action will pick up dramatically in parts 2 and 3, and you'll need the exposition in part 1 to make sense of the rest.

(Yes, having to follow a story in three widely-separated chunks is annoying.  Trust me on this, however, there is absolutely no way this novel could have been squeezed into a standard 2-1/2 hour movie.  It's been tried before with other epic works, and the results have been uniformly awful.  Kudos to the producers for insisting on doing this one the right way.)

So, watch part 1 now, or wait until 2 and 3 are out and do a five-hour marathon. Either way it should be worth your while.

Now, for those of you familiar with the book:

Atlas Shrugged The Movie, part one at least, isn't half bad.  Stripped to its bare essentials, the story moves right along, focusing on Dagny, Hank and, interestingly enough, Ellis Wyatt as they struggle against the growing collectivist tide and the gradual disappearance of their industrial colleagues.  It isn't perfect, it is in fact a long way from perfection, but it's amazing what the producers have done with a small fraction of what should rightly have been a $60-80 million budget.  The sets are lavish, the setting is 21st-century believable, and the rebuilding and inaugural run of the John Galt Line is impressive as hell - you'd swear that they blew the budget for the entire picture on this one sequence alone.

It is still, however, a low-budget picture, and it shows.  The acting isn't impressive, although Graham Beckel's splendid Ellis Wyatt makes up for a lot of that.  The writing is OK, better than the book (ducking :) ) but uninspired. Best example: Dagny and Hank's discovery of Galt's prototype motor is accompanied by the most horrific techno-babble put to film since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""... ""atmospheric vacuum!?""  Aglialoro actually boiled the novel down a little too far (no small irony here;) the movie is stock-footage-heavy even at 109 minutes run time.  It would have been nice to see a little more of the political gaming going on behind the scenes, especially in re the mind-set that led to the Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog and Equalization of Opportunity laws.  It also would have been nice to have had a few added scenes to humanize the protagonists who, let's face it, come off in the movie every bit as one-dimensional and stuck-up as they do in the novel.  Sum of topic: fewer stock shots and more scenes to help us get into the good and bad guys' heads in a perhaps 120-minute film might have made for a more interesting movie.

At any rate, Part Two is due in October... six months behind schedule, with an entirely new cast and director since they apparently didn't bother to option the part 1 cast for the remaining two movies.  Bizarre and amateurish; it's surprising that Part Two was ever made.  The producers claim that Part Three has already been greenlighted for a 2013 release, but given the turmoil behind the scenes it's anyone's guess if and when.  (Then again, given its history, it's a minor miracle that Atlas Shrugged has made it to film at all.)  I'm going to remain optimistic that all these changes will give Atlas Shrugged The Movie a somewhat-needed kick in the pants, and look forward to a rewarding parts 2 and 3.

Bottom line: Watch it, but don't expect more than what it is (A is A - heh): a set-up for the meat of the story in parts 2 and 3.  Four stars - five for the production itself, minus one for the mediocre acting and the over-compressed screenplay.",1344124800,7,5988,4.729287090558767

(as such; my rating is high due to message over delivery) however what's important here, is the message. Objectivism and its proper understanding of which is probably more appropriately coined- symbiosis-ism. Is the message that all human interaction must be inherently symbiotic or person A wouldn't accept the action, trade, etc, from person B.

Furthermore that systematic actions / causality (consequences to your actions and reactions down the chain) are to be considered before you complete one's understand and conclude an answer to your action. Such an example; taxes are stolen from us by force and then redistributed, with lots of cut (loss) from ""overhead""(often robbed by a small elite), leaving an insignificant percentage to achieve the intended result (welfare, etc.)... The point being why waste time with apparatus that has such overhead (taxation), when you can simply achieve the same result with direct trade or charity.

To further extrapolate; the direct relationship (as opposed to a centralized apparatus aka; government) / ""trade"" / action between one person and another, or one smaller group and another, is that the results are symbiotic. If ""I"", person A decide to give charity to person B- I received personal fulfillment and in return person B received charity (furthermore person B may become a productive member of society and may even contribute back to person A in the future)- it's symbiotic. However, if I ask the Government to steal from others, who don't agree with me, to give to person B, it is theft through violence and thus not symbiotic or objective, or has any relevance to your goal of providing for person B.

The horrible reviews this movie received from the critics were wildly unfair (and more revealing of individual bias and political agenda than anything else).

I am not someone who believes that anyone who happens to disagree with me is an ""idiot."" There are clearly legions of people with plenty of brain cells who find my belief structure wanting.

I've concluded that it's something about how our brain cells are arranged and aligned...

(Would that people on the political Left be as generous of their assessment of those of us on the Right.)

Ayn Rand was a self-proclaimed atheist. I most certainly am not. But, in fairness, she saw the absolute worst examples of vapid corrupted religious expression growing up in Leninist Russia. I did not.

Yet, Ayn Rand and I share the belief that life is latent with MEANING. The beliefs we hold -- and the actions we take -- really DO count for something. (And, if one observes the actual people we're surrounded by on an everyday basis, I believe most people would come to a similar conclusion.)

This is a movie about INDIVIDUALS who view themselves as entities in their own right. Not merely hopeless members of some group or collective. People who look themselves in the mirror in the morning and declare: ""I AM.""

Not arrogance. Just the reality that no one can really crawl into our skin and live our life for us.

She defined the essence of Objectivism as: ""the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.""

Anyone contemplating turning the novel into a film is faced with a daunting task. Rightly, the producers decided that it needed to be done in several parts, of which this is the first. Even so, they had to boil down the book's long philosophical soliloquies into just a couple of lines spoken by the actors. Anyone not familiar with the book really has to pay attention in order to understand the `why' of the plot's rapid transitions.

Having said this, the film is remarkably faithful in its visual imagery and in its inclusion of all the main philosophical features; of the political double dealing in Washington; of the Establishment suspicion (and sabotaging) of entrepreneurial endeavor; and of the official p.c. policy of cutting off the tall tulips and leveling everyone down to the lowest common level of incompetence. The message is even more relevant today than when Ayn Rand was writing in 1957. (See my reviews of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abolition-of-Britain/dp/1893554392/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abolition of Britain</a>&nbsp;and of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyage-in-the-Beagle/dp/070112394X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyage in the Beagle</a>).

There are no big stars in the film, which is just as well, as they would have been a distraction. Yet the film is still superbly acted by a collection of talented unknowns (at least unknown to me). I particularly like Taylor Schilling as the heroine, Dagny Taggart, but frankly they are all great - and in character.

The DVD has extra material and I would advise anyone interested in understanding more of the philosophical underpinnings, to watch the filmmaker's commentary.

Atlas Shrugged's message is a subversive one - it threatens American power structures to the point where the big studios and film financiers refused to have anything to do with it. The producer had to use his own money to fund this part. I hope he can get the backing to finish the trilogy - it's worth it!",1338249600,4,2442,5.536193029490617

4844158,3,B005N4DMMG,"I'm sure it is a monumental task to interpret something like Atlas Shrugged, so I give these folks credit for attempting it.  And I'm grateful that they brought this book to the screen.  It is too bad the adaptation has so many key flaws.

My opinion is that they almost, but not quite, understood the book.  In so many cases they missed the essential psychological aspect of a scene.  Here are a few examples: the relationship between Dagny and Rearden is posited in the simple terms of the adultery of a unhappy married man, not in terms of the deep ambivalence Hank has for his feelings toward Dagny and his feelings about himself.  Or when Francisco denies Dagny financing for the John Galt: he grunts out a dispeptic ""I can't"" instead of crying a tortured ""I can't my love."" And where is Eddie's self-unacknowledged love for Dagny?

There is one thing the movie does better than the book: capture the smooth plausibility of the looters and their mode of speech.  I guess Rand so despised them that she couldn't bring herself to do that.

The placement in 2016 and the relevance of railroads doesn't bother me as it seems to bother others.  Maybe because I just last month rode the train from San Francisco to Chicago, I was willing to suspend disbelief about that.

Schilling's interpretation of Dagny sometimes stumbles: she explains rather than acts (using speech Dagny would never use) and the emotional content of the scene suffers.  This could be the writing, hence back to my thesis.  I rather like Beckel's Wyatt: he gets the underlying violence of the character (but I wish he had thrown the wine glass; another missed opportunity).  Wisocky's Lillian is dead nuts on, smiling when she sees Hank suffer. Lerner's Mouch is completely believable.

So, on the whole: not too bad.  If you love the book you won't hate the movie.  If you hate the book this movie won't change your mind.  If you are new to Atlas Shrugged maybe this will get you to read it.",1338076800,,1964,4.659883720930233
4844159,2,B005N4DMMG,"This movie is simply a bad, vanity project. John Aglialoro, businessman and Rand fan, financed the movie and and co-wrote the script with an ""experienced writer,"" Brian Patrick O'Toole, whose past writing credits include mostly B-movie horror films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basement-Jack/dp/B002I41KX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basement Jack</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dog-Soldiers/dp/B000RW5BZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dog Soldiers</a>.  The dialogue is the typical stilted and nonsensical writing of bad horror movies.  Characters jump between topics randomly.  If you have read the book, you can follow the dialogue because you know the story lines. Those who have not read the book will be confused or miss out. None of the better aspects of this movie redeem it from the bad script. Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler do decent jobs acting as Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, but you can see the actors struggle with the script often. In a few scenes I think I could see Schilling give up on even trying to make the script work and just read the lines. The movie also fails to deliver on some of the mystique of the novel. ""Who is John Galt?"" becomes awkward and annoying rather than intriguing. The John Galt trenchcoat scenes are also weird and creepy.

The one major redeeming factor is the cinematography. The shots of landscape and trains are very well done. I hope most of the budget went to the cinematographer. I'm giving the movie two stars instead of one because of the cinematography.  Other aspects of the sets are also well done. I enjoyed seeing Rearden's foundry, but I think more could have been done with it.

I hope those who gave this movie a five star review give their reviews a second thought. Rand's philosophy was based on the individual achieving great things. I don't think bandwagoning with an ideological collective to praise mediocrity does any credit to Rand's ideas.",1337990400,4,2020,5.628289473684211

The film version of ATLAS SHRUGGED is a 1,000 times better.  Gary Cooper admired Rand but he read his lines rather than acting them out.

The performance within ATLAS SHRUGGED is much better.  It is slow-moving and has no comic relief that we often find in dramatic presentations.  This may be consistent with Rand.  I have never seen her smile or giggle.  Perhaps that is the sign of that time.  Russian immigrants were not a happy lot but were delighted to be out of the reach of Stalin.

4844162,5,B005N4DMMG,My husband & I read the book. It was almost prophetic in it's story content. The movie was very good. We cannot wait for part II.,1337472000,2,129,4.0
4844163,1,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged Part 1 is a failure in almost every regard. The two leads are wooden, the script takes shortcuts that inhibit its dramatic potential, and the CGI is cheesy. As an enormous fan of the novel, I am shocked by how little the filmmakers seem to understand about its dramatic potential as an adventure story.

The problem, fundamentally, is that the novel Atlas Shrugged is 1000 pages long and perhaps isn't suited for the big screen treatment. Rand herself was working on a 9-hour television miniseries when she died, and I have always wondered how that would have turned out. I can imagine HBO or Showtime taking on a project of such magnitude, and making it work. I've often noted that the book may be a thousand pages long, but it is also a thousand pages deep. Having re-read it a couple years ago, I was stunned by Rand's economy; some have complained that the novel is too long, but I can't for the life of me think of a scene which doesn't move the action forward in some way. It isn't padded; it needs a thousand pages to tell the story it tells.

The story of Atlas Shrugged, the novel, involves the sudden disappearance of the men of best ability, and the effects this has on the economy and politics of the world. It's unclear when Rand's novel takes place, though the story spans several years (perhaps a decade or two even). Television doesn't seem to exist, and railway is the primary means of transportation. The overall aesthetic of the novel is somewhat post-apocalyptic, somewhat steampunk, I'd say late 1800's or early 1900's, with a much more aggressive government. The United States is not identified as such, though Colorado plays a large role in the plot. Various government offices are called different things than they are in real life. The world is stylized.

  So let's start off with the first strange decision of the movie; It's set in 2016, during an apparent oil shortage, to explain the importance of railway, though by the end of the movie characters are using planes and cars, so who knows. Everyone uses cell phones, but no one uses computers. What makes this most troubling is the fact that it was most likely done for budgetary reasons; a treatment like that seen in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies would have cost a great deal more money, but been a great deal more appropriate.

  Even if you set aside the strangeness of having a 50-year-old novel that doesn't mention television set in the future, the movie attempts to look somewhat apocalyptic, and for the most part, fails. Characters walk through what are clearly buildings being remodeled, stock footage of labor protests, etc. It's not especially convincing.

  But okay, let's set that aside for a second and talk about the events of the movie; the men of ability start disappearing. Okay. This is the book's bread and butter, its explanation is left for part 3, and it doesn't seem to add up until then. Here, we have two baffled executives reacting to people they thought they could trust abandoning them. As hooks go, it's a good one, but the movie bungles a lot of dramatic opportunities that wouldn't have cost any money to implement. A major issue is that a major character blabs the secret of the disappearances in the closing scenes, leaving not much to be explained in the next two movies, if they do get made (part II appears to be filming as of the writing of this review).

  But a good story requires more skill than this. Even if the screenplay hadn't toploaded this film with too much information, the two leads are, well, terrible. Taylor Schilling, who  I've never seen in a movie before, is at least 8 years too young to play the part of Dagny Taggart, and she doesn't seem to understand many of the lines she's required to say. None of the times where she's required to show emotion have any impact. She lacks weight and conviction.

  Grant Bowler, as Hank Rearden, has a couple of good scenes, but for the most part has the same problem. The only real difference is that he looks the part. He's closer to the age I imagined Hank to be while reading the book. He has no chemistry at all with Schilling, and the fact that they are 15 years apart and look it doesn't help.

  The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. I like Patrick Fischler (from Mad Men) as Paul Larkin, Jon Polito and Edi Gathegi as Eddie Willers. Some of them are baffling; Ellis Wyatt is played by Graham Beckel, who appears to be accomplished, but the novel describes him as having a young-looking face, and being a contemporary of Dagny and Hank. Here he's an old man, a Bruce McGill/Victor Garber type.

  I could go on and on about the inconsistencies between the novel and the movie, but that's not really the point. Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 doesn't work on its own terms. It repeatedly squanders opportunities for rich drama (like its last revelation) by choreographing what's going to happen, then doing them, then doing them again.

I went into Atlas Shrugged wanting to like it. I'm the biggest fan of Ayn Rand I know, and I'm so sorry to say that she deserves better than this. Much better.",1336953600,9,5096,4.610619469026549

The book takes far too long to describe the process, and this movie makes additional mistakes to end up with a complete mash of ideas that fail to impress anything on the viewer.

The acting is fair, but the characters are not believable. This is a fault of the book, but there is still no passion in the movie. All the characters seem false and dead behind the eyes. Their motivations don't feel compelling and the modernization fails miserably.

4844170,2,B005N4DMMG,"I recently watched the movie, having not read the book, but having read Ayn Rand's ""The Virtue of Selfishness"" and Jennifer Burns' book ""Goddess of the Market.""  I am very liberal, but I have to admit that the production quality of the movie was much better than has been reported elsewhere.  And from a purely entertainment perspective, I would recommend watching this on a rainy afternoon. In fact, I honestly hope they produce the next part(s) -- I'd rent it in a heartbeat.

But I strongly criticize the plot, which obviously is based on Ayn Rand's philosophy (objectivism). Her fictional characters so easily (and implausibly) exemplify her aggressive meritocratic worldview that it amounts to philosophical masturbation.  The characters are so starkly divided into good guys (Hank Reardon, Dagny Taggart) and bad guys (Mouch, Reardon's wife) that character development is painfully stilted, and it is not really clear what anyone's motivations are, outside of the rugged individualists who are motivated by profit and production.  Perhaps the best example of this is that we see absolutely NO characters who might in any way challenge a purely meritocratic mode of thinking, including children, the sick, or the elderly.  There are flashes of the poor and struggling on the streets, but we don't meet anyone who isn't limo or boardroom material.  I'm sure the book does a better job of plot and character development, but I also know that Rand's philosophy suffers the same myopia.

To be brief, the plot seems to me to be a recapitulation of the struggles Ayn Rand's family endured in Bolshevic Russia during her childhood, except that it takes place in America. So the ""bad guys"" in the movie are really advocating communist ideas pulled directly from Marxism (e.g., a completely planned economy, paying workers based on need rather than productivity) and not even remotely the true problems we face in this country, which is NOT communism (despite what folks on the right like to believe).  So it is as if Rand has a serious axe to grind on behalf of her father, but she does so way too late and in the wrong country. Her attempts to construct bogeymen reach way too far, resulting in implausibly obstinate ""officials"" (e.g., politicians, academics, labor leaders) whose motivations -- as far as I can tell from this movie -- are inexplicably self-destructive and shortsighted. When you are defending a philosophy, such characteristics make for very convenient antagonists.",1336089600,,2482,5.093596059113301

They got the ideas right but lost the passion of the book.  The characters in this film are just going through the motions.

4844175,3,B005N4DMMG,"In order to understand what Ayn Rand was driving at in ""Atlas Shrugged,"" it is necessary to read not only the novel but her philosophical works such as ""The Virtues of Selfishness,"" ""Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal"" and ""Objectivist Epistemology.""

She begins her philosophy of objectivism by stating that we live in a physical universe as physical creatures.  She asserts that we exist as a manifestation of nature and she rejects all notions of spiritualism and mysticism, i.e. religious belief of any kind.  All living things have attributes that contribute to their existence.  Man's essential attribute in maintaining his existence is his ability to reason.  She sees any belief in the spiritual or mystical as an abandonment of reason since  there are no physical or tangible aspects to support the existence of these beliefs.
In a television interview, her interviewer said that she could not determine that there is no such thing as God and she, as an avowed atheist, simply responded by saying: ""I cannot be called upon to prove a negative.  If you make the assertion that God exists, the burden is on you prove it.""

Her reductive reasoning is that of a human being making the statement: ""I exist and I am conscious"" which is, in itself, sufficient since that human could not say the opposite: ""I am not conscious; I do not exist.""  In other words: ""Existence exists!  No further proof is required.

From her belief in the essential importance of reason as a necessary attribute to ensure man's existence her entire philosophy flows.  Man has a right to his existence as long as he is able to maintain it.  He maintains his existence by his work, largely guided by his ability to reason.  If man has the right to exist, he then has the right to keep the fruits of his own work to maintain his existence and is under no obligation whatever (and therefore cannot be forced) to sacrifice the fruits of  his work to support others as an act of altruism, which she defines as a sacrifice of one's own values for the sake of another person.  She defines ""others"" as  strangers to that man.  A man who works to support his family is not making a sacrifice in such a case as the existence and well-being of his family (or a close friend or relative) are presumably among his top values in life and it is therefore a selfish act.

This ultimately leads to her belief in unfettered capitalism as the system which leaves man free to achieve his goals and to keep the fruits of those goals if he achieves them and she therefore regards any form of government which forces a man to work for the support of others by means of slavery, feudalism, socialism, communism, fascism, etc.as inherently evil and brutal.  She isn't too far from Adam Smith in her philosophy and some say Rand's philosophy of economics is essentially warmed over Adam Smith.  This is essentially the message she repeats endlessly in ""Atlas Shrugged"" and her other works such as ""The Fountainhead"" and ""We the Living.""  You have to take it or leave it.  Like her writing, the film is labored attempt to express her philosophy",1334793600,,3091,4.715083798882682

It just seemed like the time period was wrong, the style was wrong, and the chronology of the events was wrong as well. They showed what was happening with the businessmen WAY to early, this first movie they shouldn't have revealed where the businessmen were going except maybe hinting slightly at the end.

They rushed the development of the story, which seems like a pretty poor choice considering that the crowd this was made for had to be mostly people who have read the books and the books weren't exactly quick to develop.

A valiant effort, unfortunately we have to wait for a bit now to produce a better Atlas Shrugged but who knows, maybe if I'm rich enough in 10-20 years I'll come out with one that (hopefully) does the book justice.",1334707200,4,1008,4.651685393258427

Secondly, it inspired me to actually go and read the book.

Particularly I thought they did a good job of making a ""futuristic"" book from over 50 years ago not look old-fashioned. The only concern that I have is that as they get into the later parts of the book with the next part, there are more and more philosophical speeches, which tend to get fairly repetitive after a while. On the one hand, that could make it easier to trim down, but how to do so while still getting the full sense of the moment across? (e.g. the radio broadcast could easily be 3 hours long by itself). Bottomline: Can't wait for the next part to come out.

It seems the masses are bent upon breaking up their monopolies and making them share their wealth. I had to rewrite my comment because I got a response from someone who didn't understand that the plot/story could be so stupid!

It's a parody of the struggle taking place right now between the 1% and the 99%. And Ayn Rand who wrote Atlas Shrugged was a champion of the 1%. She's clearly a fan of the billionaires in the movie, and if anyone had their doubts about Republicans and Neo-Conservatives being the 1% they had only to watch this film and have it presented to them in utterly overblown melodramatic terms.

It's a fair presentation of the current debate. My take from the story, if you can actually call it a story, is that having the wealthy 1% control the not-wealthy 99%, is just as bad as having the 99% control the 1%. In my mind the film/novel begs for a happy medium, although with everyone so charged up at the moment I doubt there could be a sensible discussion. And it is certainly NOT the message Ayn Rand would like one to get from her story.

America, Europe, the various dynasties of China, the Russian dynasties, Genghis Khan, the Egyptians. . . since man walked upright there has been a struggle for power. When a family or a small political party gains undo power there is disaster. And when the oppressed fight back with unions and sheer numbers to overwhelm and dismantle those power structures, an equal disaster takes place.

Truthfully, American history has been a series of swings from one extreme to the other. At the moment the rich have managed to trump the not-rich, but how long will it last? Unions threw off the robber barons in the early 1900's and ran too far with their power. Inevitably their backs were broken by the entrepreneurs, the current swing to the right beginning with Regan firing the air traffic controllers and culminating with Bush's tax breaks for the wealthy and shipping the ungrateful 99%'s jobs to China.

This swing from one extreme to the other must just be part of life in America. (sigh)

It sure would be a nice place to live if we weren't so polarized, and could find a common ground where greed and the worshiping of wealth weren't such a high priorities for ALL AMERICANS.",1333584000,,2331,4.618357487922705

The problem with the movie is that it is just a bullet point summary of key events from the book (and not entirely accurate ones). There's no journey in the movie, just a series of events that you're never motivated to care about. There is no character background or development. Most notably missing is the progression of Hank Rearden's character from an unhappy man with great work ethic to someone who finally allows himself to be happy. Without that progression, his relationship with his wife and family doesn't make any sense at all. Another sad loss is how the development for the Dagny and Hank relationship was portrayed in the film. The internal struggle with Hank is completely missing, and so is the great speech from the book. In the movie it seems like they were pursuing a relationship from the very beginning, which wasn't even almost the case in the book. All the key events from the book are there, but the motivation and significance of them are completely gone. The book has been life changing for some people, but the movie probably won't make people give a second thought.

Another important problem for the movie was the acting. I understand that the film was low budget, but I think my high school drama team contained better actors than some of the movie cast. Schilling's portrayal of Dagny was particularly awful (and Dagny is in just about every scene). There were only a handful of sentences from her that were actually convincing, the rest just seemed like she was reading from a phone book. The portrayal of Eddie was equally bad, but he was only in a couple of scenes. Bowler as Hank Rearden was an okay choice, but there were definitely moments of bad acting. Honestly, the only good portrayal was Francisco (and possibly James).

I was also surprised at how quickly they gave away the mystery of why the people were disappearing. I was even more surprised that they revealed that John Galt was behind it in the part one. The book was as much a mystery novel as anything else.

That said, there were some advantages to the movie that I didn't expect. They actually did a pretty good job modernizing the film. They also stayed true to the philosophical message (for the most part). I was afraid that the movie would be bad enough to turn people away from the book, but I don't think that it was. If it can generate interest in the book then it has at least served an important purpose. By itself (without the book), it wouldn't really be worth much at all though. So please, if you found any shred of decency in the movie, read the book. If you hated the movie, you should probably still read the book. I would also like to note that the philosophy of this book has been pretty much taken over by republicans (including some really crazy ones), but there is a lot more to it than they would have you believe. There is as much for liberals as there is anyone else.",1333152000,2,3154,4.508741258741258

4844185,1,B005N4DMMG,"It wasn't really until the end of the movie that I realized i was being indoctrinated with the idea of the Teaparty or some group with an agenda of less government. Like the dupes that think killing the EPA would be just terrific (let's regulate ourselves like China), hold no banksters accountable, privatize prisons and murder. Thanks, but I'm good.

Less government is the entire premise of this, story?

I was kept interested because there's a mystery going on (the heart of the story) that is captivating. People keep disappearing and allegedly go to Atlantis. Important billionaires mostly, and at the end you find out that they're all just so fed up with governmental agencies telling them what to do. Poor babes. The last guy is of course an oil magnate.

It's scary that these political groups are now making so many movies. There's a new Obama movie I've heard, and a Palin movie, bla bla BLAH. It must be true if it's a movie now? Even the Russian President has just recently said that Western Intelligence and political groups should Stop manipulating information through media. And Russian Intelligence has even propped up an international news agency RT News to combat some of this misinformation. People want to believe in the righteousness of their actions, and these things attempt to lie for us to have the justification. Im thinking this is another sad chapter of elites attempting to sociallly engineer a political reality.. This movie is a downright abomination.

4844187,3,B005N4DMMG,"I looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and I really wanted to like it.  I expected a movie totally enthralling, engaging, thrilling, etc., but by the end I just shrugged (in my mind at least) and wondered if there was going to be a part two (thankfully it looks like there will be).

Taylor Schilling was a great Dagny, just as I envisioned the Dagny character in the novel to be (OK, I envisioned a brunette and the movie made her a blonde, but that's really not that important.)  But somehow the other characters weren't real to me at all.  There didn't seem to be chemistry, intensity, or something.  I don't even know enough movie critic lingo to describe what didn't work about this movie, but there's a certain ""there"" that great movies have that wasn't there with this movie (make sense?).

Spoiler alert:
To me the most memorable part of the movie was when Henry Reardon gave his wife a bracelet made out of the first pouring of Reardon Metal, and he was ridiculed by his wife and her friends for not giving her something conventional like a diamond.  I really felt for the guy.

So, my advice is to try to see the movie without incuring any additional out-of-pocket expense.  Or maybe wait until 2016 when the entire trilogy is available in the box set with extra features and you can watch the entire story wherever you are hiding after you ""go Galt"" and decide it's not worth being productive or creative anymore.",1332288000,3,1440,4.528957528957529
4844188,4,B005N4DMMG,"Written in 1957, Ayn Rand's novel ATLAS SHRUGGED was a sensation. To this day the book continues to sell copies around the world and the late Rand has a group of followers to this day. So it would seem that this book would be easy to get made, right? Unfortunately no and the reasons why are as interesting as the book. Why would such a popular novel written so long ago take so long to be made? The producer of this film hints that it might possibly involve the politics of the film.

The rights were purchase in 1992 and it's taken since then to get the film made. The themes involved are ones of individual achievement and recognition and the idea that they should be rewarded.  Here the government claims that things are being done to protect all when instead it's more about taking from one to help another, a government where the greater good of all comes before the individual, where redistribution of wealth is the goal of the government. Sound familiar?

The year is 2016 and the world is in turmoil. The Middle East has taken to war with themselves and in the process cut off oil supplies. Limited oil means sky high gas prices (around $37 a gallon) and the most common mode of transportation of goods is via trains. The Taggart family has the biggest train system available with brother James (Matthew Marsden) at the helm. But the business is faltering due to his mismanagement. Failing to replace old rails and update the system the company is a PR nightmare. Enter sister Dagny (Taylor Schilling).

Dagny has allied the company with Reardon Steel, a company headed by Henry Reardon (Grant Bowler). Reardon has come up with a new formula for steel that makes it lighter, more durable and cheaper. Dagny contracts his company to replace the rails in the oldest and most accident prone part of the company's rail system. Fighting her all the way is a group of old type steel owners and unions with ties to government lackeys who will do anything to prevent this from being a success.

They first try to prevent this by planting stories about how unsafe the new steel is complete with studies presented by institutions who receive their funding from the government. They then change the laws to prevent one person owning more than one company, a slow way to take apart Reardon's conglomerate. But Dagny and Reardon press on. Will their endeavor succeed?

While all of this is happening, major players in many companies are disappearing. One by one they just fall off the face of the Earth. But we viewers know something is up. Before each one disappears, a shadowy figure shows wearing a wide brim hat and asking for a moment of their time. And after they disappear the same phrase keeps appearing: Who is John Galt?

There is so much story going on here that it's no wonder the entire book has been planned as a trilogy. This being part one we're introduced to the main characters and the situations that I'm sure will play out in parts two and three. But it doesn't feel like an incomplete film until the credits roll.

Never having read the book (it was never assigned in class and I've not had the chance on my own yet) it will ignite an interest in it. This movie is well made and timely considering all that's happening in the world these days. Many catch phrases used seem to be taken from today's headlines as opposed to a book that's 54 years old.

The production values of the film are superb. Great photography and direction only enhances actors who do a wonderful job. This is pretty amazing on it's own since none of the actors involved here could be called A listers or perhaps not even B list names. But each one turns in a performance that makes you believe they ARE the character being played.

In a world where 24 hour news services play along constantly, each one seeking out their next headline story, this film just has a feeling of being important to see. Yes, it does take a one sided view of the world but then again don't all films? Perhaps the best thing to do is simply sit back, watch and see what you gather from the film on your own without prodding. As for me I found myself anxiously anticipating the next two parts. Let's hope they both appear soon.",1332201600,2,4192,4.533068783068783

Reviews from some of the professional critics criticized the acting, but it was great in my opinion.  Taylor Schiling did an absolutely great job, and all of the characters were believable, especially when compared to your typical Brad Pitt movie. Most of them looked exactly like they could have been real politicians, industrialists, etc. The cinemaphotography was sharp and at times breathtaking. I can only imagine how beautiful the film would have looked on the big screen. Even though it was made only last year, the way that the film almost eerily played into even more recent changes is impressive. The raise of gas prices, increased regulation that prevents the flow of goods and capital through the economy, and the constant emphasis on ""economic fairness"" and the need to ""give back"" presage our current situation. There are even glimpses of ""Occupy""-style protests. This is an absolutely wonderful film! I sure hope they make the rest of the films.",1332115200,4,1127,4.962962962962963

The script seems as though it was written to produce a rapid-fire summary. The movie plays out like an extended movie trailer, or worse- a nonstop climactic montage- allowing for little to no character development, casually mentioning characters in passing hoping you'll understand who they are.

Sure it would be difficult to put every detail of a book into a movie- but one as serious and dense as this condensed to 90 minutes? They could have spent an extra half hour to allow the viewer to actually understand and care about what was going on- to have contempt for the disgusting moochers, to want to see the heroes succeed.

Overall a disappointment- the book communicates such a strong message, but many of my friends and family would never tackle the reading. The movie delivers so little, that I would not recommend it to them, as I fear it would turn them off to the book.",1331856000,2,1016,4.633333333333334

When you consider the size of this book you have to wonder what the reviewers who say ""The book is better."" were thinking of. Books are generally always better than the movie because so much more is put into the book, what people are thinking or feeling for example. A movie script is only about forty pages long. To those that say this movie should have been a series realize this, the man who owns the rights to this book tried to get the Hollywood crowd to make this movie but none would touch it. Why? Could it be that this is the type of world they believe in where big government controls everything through the media and they don't want it to look bad? That's a possibility. They could also have felt it was just too big to make into a good movie without spending a fortune on it. Just look around you to see what is happening to America today. Are things moving in the same direction as the movie or book? Ayn Rand came from Russia, she understood socialism, she tried to give America an understanding of what it was like and what it would be like to live in a socialist society.

4844193,1,B005N4DMMG,"For the record I've read the book in 1984 when I was seventeen...  I loved it!  All 1084 pages in a small print worn-out paperback edition...  It took me two months to read and, in retrospect, think that it was probably one of the most cinematographic novels ever written and it very well grounded in its time.  Trains, cigarettes, male-domination, traditional gender roles, and even race (does anybody remember any African-American of any importance in the book?) etc...  Capitalism had not gone through the Reagan years and was defended by people of great intellect like Hayek, etc...  Nazism was a not so distant memory and Stalinism in all its forms was a reality for a great part of the world and was a threat in some major powers such as France...  Fascist-type dictatorships were close allies of ours (and I am including us Canadians in the equation)...  The validity and the power of the novel's ideas lied in its context:  collectivism (either via socialism, crony capitalism or corporatism) was a real threat to an ideal that had been a great part of the American psyche and a very real dimension that helped it become a world power... The ideas developed by such giants as John Locke and Adam Smith were being eroded by an emerging massified society...  To be blunt, it was a brilliant piece of fiction that presented a critique of a strong tendency that was emerging in the post WW2 context...  Its arguments were not only valid and well grounded in a reality but they had a force that was both sober and idealistic...  In short, it was inspiring because it was a call to action in the real world!

But here we are in 2012!  For whatever reason we have to make a movie with such material...  Probably the most cinematographic novel ever written!  Small dunk you'd think...  It's all there...  And with CGI, where any era of the past or future can be recreated or invented, there is no need for large sets  la Cleopatra and Ben Hur (192?) and (1959)...  No... A movie that explores Ayn Rand's ideas and grounds them in their proper zeitgeist isn't a problem anymore...  Logistically it's all there... Intelligent people will get over the time warp...  Heck, everybody seems to love Mad Men (I do!!!)!

What they did was to create a disaster scenario in the vein of a cheap Rapture movie (the end of the world is coming -Haaaaaaa!) and literally invent a preposterous event such as a return to railway as the only (airplanes are destroyed en masse) means of mass transportation...  The X-file type effect (when white business men disappears to build an ideal community - the Utopia of Greed) brings a level of tackiness to the movie that erodes any type credibility that it could have...  The acting is pathetic and wooden...  Even the love scene between our heroes borders on necrophilia...  I am sorry but when they rescue a bank CEO and send him to the Utopia of Greed I could not believe it!  Maybe it was an add-in to get the movie's budget approved.  Whatever reasons, this movie (if viewed by people who have not read the book) destroys Ayn Rand's ideas one by one...

If you want to see a bad adaption of a great novel, this is it!  It's like Plan 9 from Outer Space on steroids meets 2012 (the one with Woody Harrelson)...  If you're with friends and had a couple too many, put it into the DVD player and blast it!  It has more camp value than any movie done in the 80s...

Ayn Rand is a genius who has taught millions of people the dangers of bureaucratic extortion, the leeching lazy and thoughtless, and the value of rewarding people who spend their time trying to improve the world through their work. Trying to stay true to the book did cost the film in terms of flow and comphrension of uninitiated viewers. To me it was a worthwhile trade.

4844203,1,B005N4DMMG,"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
And I have seen the Aqua Teen Hunger Force movie.

This movie is a total abomination.
The acting - it's really hard to say, considering the script was absolutely terrible and the story was so twisted and mangled that it's impossible to tell if they were just doing the best possible.
It absolutely destroys the story.  There's actually a scene where Dagny tries to prostitute herself to Francisco D'Anconia in exchange for funding for the John Galt line.  Most of the important plot points aren't in the movie at all, all of the great speeches are cut out entirely (D'Anconia's money speech?  Doesn't happen.  Not a single word of it is in the movie).
Subsequently the drama is non-existent.  You go from one scene to another in a such a way that you could only possibly understand how they relate to one another if you were trying your darnedest to read along while watching.  The plot is nonsensical, and it totally blows its load about John Galt and the Destroyer, killing the miniscule amount of dramatic tension the film actually successfully creates (which is a fairly negligible point, since it didn't really create any tension in the first place, as none of the movie makes sense in the first place).

Atlas Shrugged is my favorite book.  This movie was one of the most disappointing things I have ever experienced, and this is coming from someone who graduated college into the job market in early 2009 with a generic liberal arts degree (meaning I have known quite a bit of disappointment in my life).

4844205,1,B005N4DMMG,"Where to start... right, I have read the books and enjoyed them. I might not agree 100% with Ayn Rand, but she does have her points and important things to say. But since the books are philosophical works and commentaries on society you would think that the movie actually tried to show this. Even bring it to the forefront of the movie. And the movie doesn't, primarily because of poor scriptwriting, low production (what's there looks good, but it is the missing bits that disturb) and wooden acting (pretty much of all of the actors fail to attach any kind of believable emotion to the scenes).

Regarding the script the feeling it gives is one of having been written by someone who considers the books only at a fundamentalist level - ie who believes they should not be tampered with. Which doesn't work for these books as there is so much background in them, and speeches in them that you couldn't possibly fit each book into its own movie. So things have to be cut - understandably - but they have cut the speeches, and not really replaced them - which in turn means that the larger philosophical statements from the books are missing in the movie. Any background to the characters have been cut, we don't know who they are or how they got there - nor what their beliefs are. What we get instead is a rapid sequence of scenes from the books that the writer felt they couldn't skip because to do so would be to alter the flow/history of the book. But again, with so much cut and so little time available that means we skip from scene to scene in a very disconnected way where logic has been thrown to the side. Because so much in character-growth and background has been left out we effectively get Hank & Dagny going ""we crossed a bridge together, let's have sex"". Doesn't compute, I don't see the progression that means the physical crossing of a bridge by train meaning two characters ending up in bed the next moment.

Eddie is more or less written out of the story - he is shown here and there, but again we learn nothing about him which means that when he ultimately in the third movie meets his fate we won't know why - unless they cut the whole storythread of course, which then cuts an important part of the book - that you can be an honest hard-working individual without being either a genius or thief.

I could go on - but lets move over to the production-values instead. Effectively the whole movie takes place indoors, in scenes that are usually rather empty of other people. Probably done because it is cheap to produce, but consider this: a train is running for the first time on the john galt line, and the movie has built this up to be a great thing to look forward to. And while we get to see the train flying by in some closeups, the production that shows the aerial shots primarily shows us trees. Yes, trees.

And finally the acting. There are some reasonable scenes, in particular involving Hank Rearden has the government tries to buy the rights to his metal. But otherwise throughout the movie the acting is just flat (and in particular the leading actress, Taylor Schilling, is guilty of this). There is no believable emotion carried through any scene, they might just as well have been talking about the weather.

Ayn Rand did say some important things, and in that respect the movie represents a lost opportunity. With poor acting, and most of the message missing, there absolutely nothing here that can whatsoever recommend this... thing, to be watched.

Perhaps, I am a purist in this case.  While I am happy to see one of her works on the big screen, I felt the screen writers and director did not understand the book's core philosophy and plot development.  The players acted well, but they came off shallow and incomplete without the descriptive prose in Rand's novel.  When Dagny is shown the bracelet of Reardon Metal in the film, I did not feel that she wanted it more than anything she had ever possessed.  Galt was introduced, in a fashion, at the end of the film.  I am guessing that was intended as ""dramatic license"" or as a teaser for Part II.  I felt cheated and deprived of the cliffhanger fiction that I expected from this first installment. The question of ""Who is John Galt?"" and the long plot development to discover him and understand his philosophic viewpoint made Atlas Shrugged a mystery novel.  Part One ruined that for me.  If Part Two and Part Three are ever released, it is my sincere hope that they are much more than this freshman introdution.",1329350400,,1185,4.52112676056338

The actors and story moved me emotionally, especially as I heard echoes of all those today who believe my life, my choices, my property belong to them. Those who hate this movie, who hate Rand, who hate Objectivism are primarily those who believe they they are my masters with the ""right"" to dictate how I should run my life. Given the limitations of its production realities, this is not a perfect film. But the majority of extreme criticisms I see here reveal more about those who make those disparaging remarks than they do about the reality of this movie, the quality of these actors, or the actual story they tell. It is disingenuous, dishonest, or delusional to savage this film and those associated with it in the way it has been by too many statists and collectivists who rightly recognize the mirror this movie offers as it exposes their reprehensible ideas and behaviors for what they are. Shame on them for evading the true nature of what they advocate and what will happen if we continue down the crooked road they advocate.

Reading the negative reviews, both clever and stupid, it is clear who wants people not to see the film. The film moves fast, it is suspensful, elegant and engaging. It is a breath of fresh air in the stagnant atmosphere of media brainwashing, mediocrity and trashy sentimentality.

The premise is detached from reality.  Leaders of a metal company and railroad congratulate themselves for building a railway line.  ""We did it"" they exclaim, yet the movie never once shows any real work being done.  Apparently the rail line gets built because the CEOs say ""they"" are going to do it and it magically gets done.  The government is depicted as being against the protagonists and for other vested business interests, but these other interests are only abstractions of lazy asses.  They never get fleshed out in any meaningful way.  It is an amazingly shallow and ridiculous movie.",1329004800,2,759,4.732824427480916
4844212,1,B005N4DMMG,"If you've never read Atlas Shrugged, then the movie will be difficult at best to follow.  The events occur so rapidly and the characters are introduced so quickly without any time to mature within the viewers mind that the movie is a whirlwind that loses the philosophy that underpinned the book.  If you have read the book, you should have been disappointed in what's been titled as Atlas Shrugged Vs. the true intention of the movie which is, 'Atlas Shrugged: The Cliff Notes'.  The movie has been so poorly condensed and re-written that like Rands 'The Fountainhead' character, Howard Roark, any believer in intellectual property and the concept of ownership would have dynamtied this movie out of existence.  I stand in agreement with Rand's staunch atiitude that if her ideas and property are not going to be depicted as she intended, then it should not be depicted at all.

While I think the casting is good, I don't believe the director has a true understanding of Atlas Shrugged.  I think he merely intended to make a movie.  Atlas Shrugged sells 100,000 copies a year and has been heralded as the most influential book written next to the Bible.  I dare say not one person will ever utter those words about this mish mash of scenes.

The musical score is weak considering the vastness of the novel.  The Concerto #5 is not mentioned once, nor implied with any background sccore.  The mysterious cigarrete scene of the book is cut out as is the old man who collects cigarettes.

Like I said, I do like a lot of the casting.  I don't believe Ellis Wyatt's character was given time to show his proper spirit.  Hugh Akston was absolutley terrible and was a massive deviation from the books portrayal of philosopher turned dinner cook.  Dagney's character is well portrayed by the actress, but not the script.  The script makes her appear to be a oppurtunist slut that sleeps with a married man.  The book dives deeper into the relationship as it develops between Dagney and Hank Rearden over time and accurately desribes the feelings as they mature between the two prior to the scene at Ellis Wyatts home.
James Taggert is displayed as a political schemer while the book does not display him as such within part one of the book.

I wanted so much to like this movie, but I'm afraid I can't.  You can't take 1100 pages of one of the greatest novels in recent history and condense the first half into one hour and thirty seven minutes.  Why was Shogun so long?  Because it had a story to tell.  This movie is not telling the story as much as it's displaying a storyboard of scenes.

If you want to understand the purpose of Atlas Shrugged, read the book.  Then watch the bastardized movie version.",1328918400,10,2700,4.647679324894515
4844213,1,B005N4DMMG,"What Rand created in Atlas Shrugged is the concretization of the abstract constructs representing her beloved philosophy of objectivism.  What the novel lacks in characterization and imagery, it's abundant with complex integrations of diverse cultural and philosophical elements, placed in motion and representing the conflict between the greedy objectivists and the needy altruists.  Atlas Shrugged is a metaphorical prophecy of what life is like when altruists rule the world; namely, a world without men of mind.  What Rand achieved for her objectivists is a timeless masterpiece, not only to serve as a reference when debating those pesky altruists, but as the footnote to her philosophical legacy.

In this regard, the movie Atlas Shrugged (Part 1) does not live up to Rand's achievement or reflect her passion. What the book lacks literarily, the movie completely fails.  The actors don't act, they robotically recite without passion.  They are flat, ordinary, and lack the flare and sophistication I expect from someone with a developed philosophical mind.  I get more intellectual drama from the janitor who cleans my building.

The script is so close to the book, that it mocks it.  Half way through the movie, I was inspired by the thought that Rand's evil altruists conspired to write it as a satire of objectivism.  Away with that idea: even the altruist characters are flat and dimensionless.

The movie is burdened with cheap charades attempting to fit it into the 21st century.  Stating that it's the year 2016, mixing some cell phones with Reardon's 2010 Toyota Camry doesn't make it current.  There's also this oblong rotation of transference of scenes into the art deco era and flat screen TVs.  I felt like I am watching the Twilight Zone.

""Industrialists in the US?""  What were they thinking?  American entrepreneurs don't build railroads and they don't make steel.  They own department stores, sell insurance policies and play on the internet.  This movie has a better chance being pitched in China.

For those of us who are actually educated and understand ecnomic law it is nice to see a movie that doesn't bash capitalism but it doesn't need to be so obvious. From an actor and production standpoint I'd give it a 3.5, a 4.5 on overall story and lets hope they make the others.

All that said, why are there no extras? I shouldn't have to buy a special edition for a few documentaries and production stories to be thrown in.

4844221,5,B005N4DMMG,"My husband and I have been listening to the audiobook of Atlas Shrugged together in our car.  The audiobook is quite a bit slower than the movie, so we have made slow progress.

Although we somehow didn't realize that this movie was released, we were excited to find it on Amazon.  It seemed to closely parallel what we have been ""reading"" together.  Sometimes it seemed like parts were almost quoted out of the book.

My husband and I both found this movie to be totally captivating.  We thought it was VERY well made.  The movie does a great job of taking something that seems kind of out-dated and making it very modern and very easy to relate to.  For instance, it's all about railroad lines, and nowadays, people don't actually care much about trains...but this movie does something special so that suddenly, as an audience, we find ourselves totally buying into the idea that trains could matter now.

The actors in this movie are exceptional!  They all play their parts so well.  Dagny is beautiful, and strong, and such a great protagonist.  We really loved her.  Hank Rearden is also very good.

Typically, by the end of such a long movie, I would have been done...but my husband and I were both eager to watch Part II!  Too bad it isn't out yet.",1327795200,8,1255,4.565022421524664

4844224,3,B005N4DMMG,"A film version (the first part of a planned trilogy that might never be made) of the magnum opus of famous Libertarian author Ayn Rand. It might be surprising that despite the book having sold millions of copies since it first came out in 1957, Hollywood could only release decades later a low budget version of it, with a no name cast (the only actors that I could recognize from other films, and I am a frequent moviegoer, were Jon Polito and Michael Lerner, who have played supporting roles in several movies by the Coen Brothers).

The movie is about how two businessmen (Dagny Taggart, played by the pretty Taylor Schilling, who runs a troubled railroad company and Hank Rearden who builds a special metal for its tracks) are repeatedly thwarted in their plans to create a great railroad by government intrusion and regulation. Meanwhile, some businessmen are mysteriously disappearing, all of which would presumably be explained in the two remaining movies (Almost all the characters shown in the film are wealthy businessmen, apparently the only people that Ayn Rand found interesting).

It is curious that while the movie is set in 2016, the most important industry in the US seems to be the railroads. I think it would have been better if the filmmakers used two other options here, either they could have set the film in the fifties, as in the book, and keep the trains, or they should set it in the near future around a more contemporary industry (like computers, or biotech, or any other similar).

The film starts a bit stilted and has a lot of clunky dialogue, and it is mostly about the characters talking and expressing their political and philosophical opinions. Yet, one has to admit that the movie has certain integrity in not watering down the author's libertarian message (despite it being presumably an unpopular one in the artistic community and with the cultural elite). And the movie gets better as it goes along, and by the end I found it being quite compelling, despite its limitations.",1327536000,,2013,4.828985507246377

4844229,5,B005N4DMMG,"You're going to have to read the book if you really want to know what this film is all about. There is no way to recap the story or the philosophy behind it in the short review. So I will have to assume that you either have read the book or intend to read it.

As with most book adaptations one could build a laundry list of what is missing. I personally was hoping for a period piece. However after viewing this presentation I realize that a period piece would be very clumsy and that they made the right decision by adapting it to a more up to date venue (September 2, 2016.) Then of course you have to choose the actors and that must've been a monumental task.

Bottom line is this is as good as it's going to get. I actually found myself enjoying the film even with the anticipation of some story parts from the book and am looking forward to the next two parts.

If you haven't read the book first though there are a lot of things that have been implied a few things that have been combined or dismissed so you will have to watch carefully to be able to figure out what the story line is and the reasoning behind the action.

If you're not inclined to read books that can help you set up taller at the table (aprox 336 pages) then be sure to look at the DVD extras as they will give you a better insight as to what the producers are trying to portray with the various scenes.

Being familiar with the book, the movie is what you might expect; condensed.  But the goal of this movie, I don't believe, is to appeal to people who are already fans of Rand.  Meeting with strong critical opposition (as would be expected), this movie failed in the theaters upon release.  Now that it's available for streaming on Amazon, and hopefully soon on Netflix, it should extend to more broad of an audience.

As a result, this makes the movie a very ambitious work of art, but one that is not complete. It represents the first portion of the book, but it does a good job of capturing that section of the book. The main difficulty with this movie is that it overlooks a great deal of background information which Rand assumed the reader to had when she wrote the book. Today's reader may not have this background knowledge because these topics have not been as relevant as of late, which makes the foundation of the story somewhat less obvious as a result. The book tries to get as much of this in the story as possible, but space is limited which means some was left out. Aside from this, the acting was very good and very well done. It was entertaining, and moving. All in all, I would suggest it to anyone.",1326240000,4,884,4.331325301204819

Please take this in the sprirt it is intended from a non-partisian position.

We need be increasingly concerned people that talk openly about our understanding of our world issues and think about why we are here in the US and not in a different country.  I believe, I am here by the grace of god and I would not want to be anywhere else in the world.  We have freedoms that we are giving away every day, with every vote.  We must suck it up and be willing to make changes for a better government.  There will definitely be some pain involved, but we need to get government under control.  (Notice I said, get government under control, because it will not work if they continue to control us.)

There are so many issues to tackle today but let's take one that everyone can visualize.  Ask yourself one question regarding your personal life or if you own a business; if you are under water financially, how you would get your situation under control? What if your financial situation was tied to life or death for you or all your loved ones?  I personally would not be able to ""save lives"" by spending more money.  Ask your parents or other responsible persons what they would do if they were in this situation, how they would work out of it.",1325980800,3,1279,4.377118644067797
4844253,5,B005N4DMMG,"Many good reviews here (both positive and negative) touching on different points... But everyone misses one big one: this movie is a jewel in its own category. How many films are even attempting to show ""the other side of the story""? How many directors even try to appeal to the business, intelligent, educated 1%? Someone here mentioned the makers and the takers. Considering the takers are 99%, why would anybody bother with 1% (who often are even ashamed to show their face today)?

It's easy to make action blockbusters or love/sex flicks appealing to the majority and with $1B budget that are guaranteed to fill theatres with the simple types or stoned teenage crowds. It's much harder to risk your reputation, career and limited budgets to make a ""politically-incorrect"" movie that exposes the deepest troubles of the modern society, and expect anybody to still like it. That's why not many of them are made to begin with, and this one is a fabulous attempt. How successful it is - I don't know.

As for the plot - read the book. Nobody ever expects the movie to really copy the book. I personally like the fact that they placed the story in the modern days. It's refreshing. I was almost ready to see dark b/w images of Metropolis-like gloomy world. The fact that the economy is already broken - well, the movie gives some good hints of who could have broken it, and it's definitely not the makers themselves. The rest we can watch in ""real time"" every morning on CNN and MSNBC today, why shoot the movie?

Any way, if you are a thinker and want to see an alternative to your typical Hollywood - watch this movie. If you'd rather enjoy the world the way it is for 99% - don't. Save your money.",1325980800,3,1700,4.567213114754098

I would get excited every few years when rumor of a deal nearing to make this a reality was in the works. A few years back when I heard that Pitt and Jolie's names were being tossed around I found it intriguing but also wondered if the star power might trump Ayn Rand's crucial message. I was not the least bit disappointed with the lesser known cast when I finally watched it and even thought Taylor Schilling was very convincing and exhibited the passion of Dagny Taggert. The abscense of big names did not make this movie any less significant. The screen writers and producers did a great job of bring the scenes into contemporary times although being a timeless classic, I would have been fine with the setting being over fifty years ago. It is somewhat frustrating to end part one knowing that things are really just beginning to go into full swing and not knowing with certitude that the financing will be there to continue the story. At barely over a hour and a half long, it was over before I knew it.

It is not necessary to be a passionate student of Ayn Rand or to accept her philosphy of objectivism in order to grasp the message of this movie. It is quite simply individualism vs. collectivism.

That's just the way it is. So, if Ayn Rand had any say in it, anyone who purports an inkling of her passion would admit that she would not be satisfied with less, or any shortcuts for that matter, and that's why she is loved; because she takes life, and the endeavors of humankind that seriously.

Although Rand reportedly was a consultant on the picture, apparently she was unhappy with the way Hollywood treated her book, which was why there was no ATLAS SHRUGGED movie until now.

Even after Rand's death in 1983, it took years of legal wrangling with her estate before the movie rights to ATLAS SHRUGGED were finally acquired. There were several false alarms, and no major studio would touch it because of the controversial nature of the material.  Finally, the movie was released in spring 2011.

The movie is actually quite enjoyable and the story is compelling.  Although the actors are little-known, they do an excellent job, and the film defends the Objectivist philosophy quite well.

The movie only covers the first part of the book, so the story is incomplete.  This was supposed to be the first of three ATLAS SHRUGGED pictures, but since Part 1 bombed at the box office, there probably won't be a Part 2 or 3, unless healthy DVD sales lead to a direct-to-video release.  So enjoy the movie for what it is; this is probably all you are going to get.

UPDATE: I saw ATLAS SHRUGGED: PART 2 in the theater last Saturday (October 13).  It has a totally different cast, and was a good continuation of the story (the movie ends when Dagny Taggert, the lead character, finally meets the elusive John Galt, after being injured in a plane crash).  I will probably buy the PART 2 DVD when it is released; it's not doing too well at the box office right now, so I have a feeling that if PART 3 is made, it will probably go directly to DVD and will never see the light of a theater.

4844261,5,B005N4DMMG,"This movie is plain magnificent, the cinematography, the script, the acting all superb! Normally, when I watch a movie based on a great book or novel, the question always arises, how does it compare to the book?

The book, Atlas Shrugged, is fantastic, but a bit too long toward the end, particularly to the impatient younger generation. The repeated question of ""Who is John Galt?"" becomes a bit old in the book, but not so in the movie.  So the answer- as far as Part 1 concerns us- is  the movie so far.  Why? The writing and the plot for both the book and the movie are a tour de force, but the movie, at a faster pace and with such actors that match the novel's characters so well, ""live and in color"" on the screen- may just tilt the balance!

The movie is like the book, a cliffhanger of intrigue and suspense, but it just moves faster- and we want more!  The casting, moreover, is outstanding. Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler give magnificent performances as Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, and so due the rest of the cast in their respective roles.  When Ayn Rand was alive her first pick to play Dagny Taggart was Farrah Fawcett in the 1970s, when Farrah was at her peak, but I don't see how equally beautiful Taylor Schilling could have been beaten!

And the parallels with the present could not have been better chosen by Fate herself. The movie takes place in 2016, and America is teetering on the abyss of economic disaster, oil prices climbing out of sight, government collusion with business (who are cooperating with the increasingly socialistic American state) is rampant, regulations mount, economic freedom is being curtailed, individual liberty itself hangs on the balance. The most productive citizens are disappearing, while those who are dependent on the state are multiplying...the country is on the verge of revolution. Everything depends on our rugged individualist heroes (and their Objectivist philosophy), Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, but they are yet to find out ""Who is John Galt?""

I give thumbs up to this magnificent movie and can not wait for the next installment!

4844262,3,B005N4DMMG,"This is gonna be a really tough review to write.  I've been
a Rand enthusiast since I first began reading her stuff as a
twenty-something in the 80s.  I REALLY wanted to like this
film, but...  And the story lies in the ""but"".  Possible
spoilers start after the point indicated.

I'm hoping Kaslow, Aglialoro, et al will find my comments and
read them in the same spirit that I'm writing them - as
constructive criticism.  Maybe some will be useful for Parts
2 and 3.

Rand presented her readers with a tough combination of concepts.
For me, they have sometimes seemed mutually-exclusive.  Man's
highest goal is happiness through achievement (agreed).  To get
there, I've been told I must accept Rand's entire philosophy,
some parts of which, can make one fairly unhappy (oops).  I
consider myself a libertarian with conservative leanings, or
maybe a conservative with libertarian leanings.  I attended
quite a few Objectivist meetings in early 80s Los Angeles,
and I will never forget the informal gathering where I first heard,
""We need to legalize drugs.""  My initial outrage turned to careful
thought, followed eventually by acceptance.  It was the first
time in my life a major personal belief had been upended and I
realized ideas have real power.

But the organized meetings themselves were too formal and I quit
going when the whole thing began to seem perilously close to a
cult.  But over the years I've read pretty much everything Rand
produced and have embraced the best of it.

I assume the reader's knowledge of the general plot.  The movie
was generally well-done - I'd use the word ""workmanlike"".  It's an
okay adaptation of very tough material consisting almost entirely of
dialogue.  ""Atlas"" is a thinking man's story and it seems action flicks
are what sell.

A film can be ""talky"" and still be first-rate.  Consider ""Twelve
Angry Men"" (1957), a drama that takes places almost entirely
inside a closed jury room, with no action in the modern sense
at all.  It succeeds magnificently by concentrating on
character development - something ""Atlas"" makers SHOULD
have no trouble with, considering Rand's array of fascinating
players.  In real estate, it's ""location, location, location"".  In
dialogue-driven films its ""characters, Characters,
CHARACTERS"".  ""Atlas"" crew, are you hearing me?

I had to grin as I watched Aglialoro complain on the CD
about how he bought the film rights, ran 'em up the flagpole,
and got zero salutes from the usual gang of Hollywood idiots.
So he did what every true individualist would do: he got
together an UNUSUAL gang and did it himself - with unknown or
little-known players and a tiny budget.  Well, tiny in comparison
to most modern bloated monstrosities.  I give him and the entire
crew an A+ for effort.

There are only a few ways you can blow something up or stage
a car chase on film.  But there are a million ways to imagine the
key dialogue sequences in ""Atlas Shrugged"".  For me, they are
electric, sizzling with meaning.  I wanted them to be that way as
I watched the film.  But I've found great expectations fueled by
imagination can seldom be fulfilled on the screen, and it's
especially tough to accomplish that in the realm of ideas.

So while the players delivered their lines, and the film moved
along and held together okay, there was just something missing.
I was looking for more zip, more intensity.  More... something.

We're talking about fighting ideas evil enough to destroy the
world, right?  Maybe it's because so much of ""Atlas"" is
internalized, and actors who can express themselves that way are
very few (and expensive).

But if Aglialoro and Johansson can figure out a way to clean up
the dialogue and get a little more out of their players, Part 2
will certainly be better than Part 1, perhaps much better.

I've heard that George C. Scott deliberately played Patton way
over the top and was mortified when the audience took him seriously.
Maybe that's the kind of zip we need in Part 2.  Just a suggestion...

Graham Beckel stands out as oilman Ellis Wyatt, showing some
righteous indignation, then support as he comes to understand
Dagny's motives.  Jsu Garcia hints at the torture D'Anconia is
going through, but he needs to crank it up a bit.  Ethan Cohn is
fine as Owen Kellogg in a nicely-realized bit when he does something
nearly all of us have done - I'm looking forward to seeing him again
later on.  In fact, I tend to remember the supporting roles a lot more
than the leads.  And that's approaching dangerous ground in a film.

Part 1 is definitely worth watching, but the bottom line to me is
this: would it convince someone who was unfamiliar with the story
to try the book?  Unfortunately, the answer is no.  Not an
unconditional no, just no.  Aglialoro et al still have two more
chances to change that conditional no, by making some very
attainable improvements...

****Possible spoilers start here****

Here are some specific improvements I think would have made Part
1 better.  Again, these are meant to be CONSTRUCTIVE.  I genuinely
want Parts 2 and 3 to be better.

The story has been moved to the near future and has definite
technology-related themes.  Major tech-related gaffes are
inexcusable, especially when they can be easily and inexpensively
avoided.  Where was the technical advisor when the ride on the
John Galt line was put together?  A train moving at 250 mph
around the corners shown would have made it absolutely impossible
for passengers to sit in standard seating, much less stand and
casually talk.  They would've been flattened against the wall
of the cab.  We're talking near three gees here.  It's simple physics.

The discovery of the motor at 20th Century is a key scene - that
is even admitted outright by Aglialoro on the commentary.  Yet,
in my opinion, it was somewhat somewhat botched.  The motor's
technical basis was a hopelessly muddled amalgamation of
gobbledegook to this longtime aerospace engineer.  Why didn't
Dagny drop to hands and knees in excitement and dig the remnant
out of the junkpile, soiling her clothes and cutting her hands as she
did in the story?

The dialogue seems stilted at times.  It's tough enough trying
to get across complex and unusual (to many) ideas without making
it even tougher by speaking in a way that simply isn't done
any more in familiar conversation.  Specifically, ""will not""
instead of ""won't"", ""I am"" instead of ""I'm"", etc. Such usage
causes the formal alternatives to lose their emphasis when it's
most important.

When translating an enormous book of ideas to a film, it's
not only absolutely imperative to capture the most important ones,
but also critical to make sure they come across clearly on screen.
An example where one did not was during Dagny's conversation
with Dr. Stadler about his three students - a critical part of the
story. Stadler mentions one became a depraved playboy
(D'Anconia), one disappeared, and one became a pirate who robs
from the [garbled] and gives to the rich (Danneskjold).
Negahban's accent is so pronounced, and his words so nearly
mumbled that I had to replay the dialogue to ascertain the last
word was ""rich"".  Then I had to replay it several more times until I
finally felt I could say the [garbled] word was ""state.""  It had
obviously (at least to me) been dubbed over the original word
""poor"".

And thank goodness for that!  Failure to do so would have been a
mistake far worse than than the one made on the first 100K or so
DVD jackets. (I apparently got one of the earlier ones, proudly
trumpeting ""Ayn Rand's novel of courage and self-sacrifice"".  She
would have said, acidly, ""I am not sure which novel it was the
creators of that jacket read, but it wasn't mine."")

The fact that pirate Ragnar Danneskjold ""robs from the state
and gives to the rich"" is a critical story detail I fear is all but
lost here to anyone who doesn't know the plot already.

The editing and scene setup was often desultory.  At the end of
Akston's conversation with Dagny at the diner, a powerful moment
is wasted when he she tells him, ""I'm not going to give up trying to
find the inventor of that motor.""  At that instant, Akston is walking
away and both actors have their backs to the camera!  Cut to Dagny's
face.  Then he answers, OFF SCENE, ""Don't worry Miss Taggart,
he'll find you.""  No reaction shot, no change in her expression, she
simply walks off screen.  It was a squandered scene, one that should
have been one of the most powerful in the movie.

The great producers of the world are disappearing, and Dagny
can't figure out why.  Here she meets one of its finest educators who's
become a hash slinger in a diner.  He's done that for a reason, he's
MOTIVATED (giving up is a sort of motivation).

Dagny is searching for the motor's inventor.  She's MOTIVATED.
Or at least she should be. But I saw no motivation on her face
at the end of this scene. Even BEFUDDLEMENT can cause
motivation.

In fact, reaction shots are AWOL throughout the film.  When
Dagny tells D'Anconia she is naming her gamble ""The John Galt
Line"", he exclaims, ""What!?""  After she gives her reason - the
phrase means ""giving up"" and she is not about to give up,
she is going to win - the moment is is flat wasted when we don't
get a final reaction shot from D'Anconia.  A smile for her audacity
erased slowly by a painful darkening for the terrible trial he
knows still awaits her.

The whole crew needs to take the visibility-of-motivation issue
up a few notches for Part 2.

There are reasons why a novel written over fifty years ago still
sells hundreds of thousands of copies a year (half a million in
2009).  If Part 2 can tap into that, we'll see a big improvement.

""Atlas"" gets two stars from me for merit, and another star for even
trying the dang project at all!  Now let's see improvement.",1325721600,2,9789,4.729905437352246
4844263,3,B005N4DMMG,"I was hoping, from looking at preview clips, that this film would be a good interpretation of Ayn Rand's blockbuster novel. But low budget and perhaps a rush to production led to a less-than-optimum film. Here's my impression:

1. As usual, the rule, ""if it's not on the page, it's not on the stage"" holds true. The script is lacking. Example: a scene with Dr. Stadler, the tragic, amoral genius of the State Science Institute and Dagny Taggart. Suddenly, in a discussion of the decision to condemn Readen Metal for political reasons rather than scientific, Stadler launches into a story about the three brilliant students he and another professor (Hugh Akston) shared. No explanation about why this was so germane to the discussion. A big ""HUH"" unless you'd read the novel. Hugh Akston (the noted philosopher and distinguished professor) here is interpreted as a hippy burnout. I don't think a philosopher who taught ""A is A"" and ""Everything is Something"" would be a hippy burnout. And no one is surprised he's running a diner; this would be surprising for the noted professor from Patrick Henry University, but not for a hippy burnout, so no surprise, no drama. Bad choice.

2. Poor cinematography. While I applaud the way the low budget used stills of existing cities, rails, and other scenery, the vital expression of speed and excitement in the first run of the John Galt Line fell flat due to bad cinematography. The impression of speed just didn't happen; and a few well placed cameras or sped-up effects could have worked here. The long shots of the Colorado mountains decked with autumn aspens, shot from helicopter, just didn't work to convey the feeling of a speeding modern bullet train. And on that note, the cab of the engine of a bullet train CANNOT just have an armchair for the engineer and have a couple of people (Taggart and Rearden) standing behind in the mostly empty cab. HELLO! This train is supposedly speeding up to 250 mph. What about INERTIA? Anyone remember Newton's Laws of Motion? No.

3. GREAT VILLAINS, flat heros. The villains are spot-on and the acting is good. Orren Boyle, the greasy, layabout steelmaker and Wesley Mouch, the Washington hack are cast well and their acting is good. You do need a good villain and here we have two excellent ones. Lillian Rearden is PERFECT. Her smarmy, sly sarcasm and bitterness are expressed with every twist of her lips.

But the protagonists are all cardboard. They LOOK good (except for D'Anconia, who is a bad budget version of Banderas.) But Dagny's toughness is just a still severity, and the supposed fireworks when she and Rearden fall in love are absolutely as flat as a wet firecracker. Bah. ""I want to kiss you."" Right. That is hot. Really hot.

The acting is not up to the mark, and that's the fault, I think, not only of the script, but more of the direction. Villany is easier--your role is defined (be bad, be evil.) But noble and good and heroic are harder. More motivation, color, conflicting emotions needed, and that's the job of the director to bring out (in the absence of better actors.)

Summary: nice try but no cigar. The film IS true to the novel's premise, and the mixing in of current events (the recession) is chilling and adds to the production. But the poor script and acting and cinematography make this a second-rate film. It could have been so much better.",1325721600,,3363,4.759862778730703

I can't help but compare the media's lack of support for Rearden Steel in the novel to the critic's lack of support for this movie. It seems that the tried-and-true concept of hard work and entitlement to your own rewards wasn't appreciated by many in the book other than Dagny and Hank - I feel most of the critics wouldn't appreciate their values, either. I don't believe it's fair to penalize the ratings of this movie based on political preferences.",1325548800,4,657,4.615384615384615

4844267,1,B005N4DMMG,"I waited for the movie with bated breath. Had to buy the DVD because the movie wasn't shown anyplace except large cities. Not a complete waste of money, but not worth the price - or the wait.

The casting is terrible. James Taggart is too GQ. Neither Dagney nor Reardon have enough (any?) dirt under their fingernails. Francisco is too hairy and not suave enough. Akston is too young and unkempt.

SO many missed opportunities in this movie. The whole scene with Hugh Akston completely missed the point of the meeting the book presented. They barely showed the cigarette that Dagney was so intent upon. The ""love scene"" between Reardon and Dagney lacked any of the emotion and dialog the book had. It was just a sex scene that not only misses the point, it made us think less of our two main characters as just being adulterous.

DON'T buy the movie. If you read the book, you'll be disappointed. If you didn't read the book, you'll wonder why people rave about it.

The movie AIN'T the book! Not even close. :( Makes me sad - really.

Another note - As someone who also read Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" many times, I waited anxiously for that movie to be released. I was thinking that it *couldn't* be very good and was expecting to be disappointed. I'm happy to admit I was wrong. With minor exceptions and an omission here and there for time's sake - that movie was worthy of the book. Peter Jackson and crew made a GREAT movie.

I only mention that because great books CAN become great movies. Unfortunately, now that Atlas Shrugged has been botched, it's unlikely that anyone will ever try to remake it. This producer, director, actors, crew - just plain overreached. They were not up to the task. They failed - and they've detracted rather than adding.",1325376000,8,1760,4.571428571428571

4844270,5,B005N4DMMG,"This is the cinematic adaptation of Atlas Shrugged, which is a fictional vehicle used by Ayn Rand to articulate and promote her vision of laissez faire capitalism, what she called objectivism and individual freedom from a collectivist state.

Don't expect classic Hollywood formulas and plot lines.  Much like ""The Fountianhead"" starring Gary Cooper (1949), this is a libertarian propaganda piece.  Every other line is a lecture about the benefits to society of individual freedom and the perils of big government altruism and eventual stifling of man's innovation and productivity.

If you don't understand Ayn Rand's philosophical concepts of an individual's right to self-determination, you will think this movie is boring and makes no sense.  It's pretty deep stuff.  You might want to rent ""Cars 2"" instead.

4844273,4,B005N4DMMG,"I did not have the opportunity to see the movie in a theater because Atlas Shrugged was a limited release. I did read several reviews that were, of course, harshly critical and so I was suspect of them. The DVD allowed me to judge for myself. This movie was, indeed well made, and on a budget far smaller than blockbusters made today. There are few philosophic films made today, but Atlas Shrugged is definitely that. No need to revisit the subject of the Ayn Rand's book except to say the movie is placed in the near future--2016.  The United States is in economic free-fall, the price of gasoline is stratospheric, and the government is oppressive against successful entrepreneurs who are the economic engine of America and in fact the world.

This movie is prophetic and a metaphor of our times. The United States has gone from a creditor nation to a debtor nation and the manufacturing base nearly gutted as a result of government regulation and offshoring which has destroyed millions of jobs. America is in fact in a continuing depression and the consensus of economists is that this will continue for years. Europe is an economic basket case and these countries are so deeply in debt many wonder how they will resolve it.

A word about the principal actors.  Taylor Schilling as Dabny Taggart and Grant Bowler as Hank Rearden seem perfectly cast, their performances are very good, and I hope they return to do the future segments. It would be disruptive to the theme if other, bigger names, are brought in to improve box office revenue.

For these and other reasons, Atlas Shrugged is a movie for our time. This movie is Part I and if you miss this in the DVD cover art, the ending will be a downer. The movie performed poorly as the box office and did not recover its costs of nearly 20 million dollars. However, the production company that made Part I states Part II will follow in 2012 and the last segment in 2013. I certainly hope so. Many are looking forward to them.

Power, money, success, triumph of achievement, desire, greed, altruism, loyalty, deceit, and control of people to get what they want - at all costs. The twists and turns of the plots will keep you thinking and wondering how Ayn Rand was able to write an eerie, almost prophetic masterpiece over 50 years ago that mirrors our lives and what is happening in America today.

The cinematography and images are magnificent and the accompanying music transports you to another level of entertainment and contemplation about life as you know it vs. what life ought to be.

I think this 3 part movie series will be accepted by readers of the book more easily than by anyone who has not read the book.

As with most multiple part movies, I think that as each installment is released it, viewers will re-visit the previous installment to keep the momentum of the storyline alive.

Acting is fine, the scenese are fine, but does not touch the brilliance of the book.

It is surprisingly well done, given both the challenges inherent in adapting this book to film, and the enormous amount of bad press it has gotten.

4844288,1,B005N4DMMG,"This movie just fails as an adaptation to the book on so many levels. First off, it's a bad movie. It's boring and confusing. It uses plenty of scenes from the book, probably too closely, word for word (it seems), and that's all it seems to do. It's not about where you are going, it's about the journey getting there in Atlas Shrugged. Honestly, the movie feels like someone made a timeline of part 1 from the book, grabbed every key event, and filmed them without making them flow together and speeding up every scene faster than it should be. I'm convinced the only way to bring this book to film is by converting each chapter from the book into 1 hour episodes. Should have taken place in an alternate 1950, trains just don't work in 2016 (I know it has been said Atlas Shrugged always takes place in the not far future, I don't care).

Main characters aren't introduced to the audience appropriately. They are thrown, rough and hard. Nothing is really shown about Dagny, how hard she works, how she worked her way from the bottom to the top of the company when she could have easily just inherited it, the brief memories of her childhood, long nights, the frustration of her brother and Washington's medaling. Similar complaints about Reardon but not as bad. He makes a big deal about his things and his company, when it comes up for about a minute, but the movie falls short at explaining why it belongs to him in the first place. I wish the movie went more into how he wants everything he owns with his name on it because he has worked for it. Both act like supervisors just waving there hands to get things done and making deals. The book strongly implied that Dagny knew how to do everything her employees did, and Reardon as an engineer, making the design for the John Galt Bridge that can be done by using Reardon Steel, allowing low costs and better performance.

The helplessness and decay of the world is barely present. In the book I saw it as the United States, the last productive country, was in decay, resources, tools, and machines rare and becoming non-existent due to a lack of effort to take responsibility and get work done, and absurd government involvement. Nearly everything in the movie looks clean. A room is shown for what seems the whole scene about the workless town. The incomplete engine is sitting on a shelf for any looter to take, not in a pile of scrap like the book, again making everything look effortless for Dagny and Reardon (though they did show them going from place to place to find info). Cinderella Man showed desperation and despair better than this. No scenes of the working world itself, like Dagny on the train listening to her favorite composer.

Dagny and Reardon's attraction seemed rushed and strange. In the book, I don't believe there is any sexual attraction until the train ride on the John Galt Line, where in the film, it seems to be at first sight.

Jim Taggart seems too confident in the film. I always thought of him as a confident character with a quick tongue and short temper, but in the face of real authority, he just breaks down in anger shouting questions, never making a commitment in his decisions for fear of being wrong, like many other side characters.

I wish the film emphasized how the looters were thinking in the book, needs and feelings before money. Needed to show, not tell the audience who and what the looters were.

John Galt scenes are dumb. They are not in the book, and the reader only has guesses and rumors about Galt in Part 1. People just retire and disappear.

One last small complaint, Except for the Washington characters, I thought everyone else needed to be about 10 years older.

Bottom line, everything seems too fast, scenes are too brief, and poor transitions leads to a boring film. It fails as a film and makes an ok video PowerPoint of part 1 of the book at best. My best hopes are for a reboot, not a part 2.",1324771200,48,3916,4.528995756718529

It gave me a bit of the sense of a ""Heaven's Gate"" with epic aspirations falling short but not nearly as far short as ""Heaven's Gate"" fell.

4844292,4,B005N4DMMG,"For me, Atlas Shrugged is one of the ten greatest novels ever written, and I can say that even though I do not necessarily agree with Objectivism. With that backstory, I went into this flick with high demands but not super high expectations. While this is not a stellar film experience, I must say I was engrossed! For me, an Atlas Shrugged movie would have to do three things really well: convey the philosophy, rock the plot, and get the characters right.

Rand's philosophy gets very little air time here, but I'll give Part 1 a pass because this is a trilogy. The director may be relying on the second or third 'acts' to develop the philosophical angles. Since Rand did her philosophy to death in some portions of her book, a less heavy-handed approach could be a plus.

In terms of distilling Rand's mammoth plot, I think they made some good choices. As opposed to the slow economic decline Rand painted, we start out in the middle of a crisis. This was a brilliant choice as it allowed a good deal of explication to be avoided. We now know what the problem is, so the film can focus on who caused it, who can stop it, and what's in their way. I also like how they drew the crisis into parallel with some of the feelings and issues Americans have today. They also quickly deal with the obvious plot problem: why should the audience care about railroads? This issue is credibly handled in the first minutes of the movie, and it was wise not to dwell on it. The use of blackberrys and texting seems shocking in Rand's speechifying world, but they are a perfect way to telegraph some of the conversations and keep things moving.

On the downside I'm not keen on the early revelation of a man behind the 'disappearances', perhaps because I felt the mystery aspect of the novel was one of the key plot hooks. Even though the way they have the men 'disappear' makes good dramatic use of the visual medium, I still feel they could do more with it. The 'destroyer' could be portrayed in a horror movie, stalker way (he kind of is already with the shadows and waiting for people to be alone). Have some fun with it! I also found the pacing a bit rushed, but I also find Gone With the Wind rushed compared to the book. Perhaps any movie based on a book this big can't help but seem rushed by comparison. No matter, a longer run time (an extra 30 minutes would only take us to 2 hours) is clearly needed. Given the trilogy approach, a longer run time would help with pacing but wouldn't burden the audience too much.

As for the actors inhabiting these larger than life roles, I like the choices they made though there is some wooden acting. The actress who plays Dagny is sometimes a bit stiff (and I'm not sure she knows how to walk in heels), but she definitely 'gets' the character and conveys her aura. Hank Rearden is also well-played, and the actor is physically perfect for the role. The jury is still out on John Galt and Francisco D'Anconia who each get minimal screen time, although the updating of playboy Francisco into a 'playa' is pitch perfect. Likewise, the updating of James Taggart into the typical do-nothing, pampered executive all too common in the business world today is spot on. We'll see how the actor does as his character starts to show his true colors. A big plus is the guy who plays Ellis Wyatt! He totally sinks his teeth into the role and steals the scenes he's in. On the other hand, the woman who plays Lillian Rearden needs more juice. She's playing the vixen-bitch in this philosophical soap opera, and she should camp it up a bit. The actor playing Hugh Akston was able - in one minute of screen time - to repel me. He played Akston with the aura of a surly Walmart check-out clerk rather than a brilliant scholar. Terrible choice and actor.

One surprising note is how the saggier acting moments were more than offset by the benefits of the cast of virtual unknowns (or at least a cast with low recognition quotient). These actors were definitely committed to their roles. Besides, I find it terribly distracting in dramatic movies to have recognizeable stars onscreen. It's like when I saw a biopic on Jane Austin starring Anne Hathaway. I never got past the fact that I was watching Anne-Hathaway-playing-Jane-Austin. Of course some of that was her poor performance, but some of it is just the star power. You really have to be as talented as Meryl Streep or Colin Firth to overcome that so that the viewer can forget their watching a film with a star. I don't think I would have enjoyed this movie as much if Dagny had been played by Julia Roberts or Kate Hudson or whoever, even if they did the job perfectly. Brad Pitt as Hank Reardon? Ick.

Bottom-line, Atlas Shrugged Part 1 is technically a low-budget movie, but it looks and functions very well all things considered. I thoroughly enjoyed it and, like I said, my demands were pretty high as I can easily hate adaptations of my favorite novels. Part of the fun here was anticipation: how will they handle the lighting of Wyatt's Torch? What will Wesley Mouch look like? From what I understand, Part 2 is coming in Fall of 2012 and I'm looking forward to it very much!",1324684800,5,5158,4.505341880341881

It's forced and tries to cover too much ground in too little time.  I found myself eventually fast forwarding scenes to avoid wincing at the bad acting preposterous dialog.  Here's a movie with a lot to say and little time and they extend the scenes too long apparently cause shooting dialog is cheaper than doing more scenes.
The people who made this film didn't modernize the setting or people to make it connect with our time.  This is a novel written in the 50's so reflects that times points of views.  You can understand it best if you understand the history of the period and the experiences of the author.

It delves into the mind set of two philosophies, liberalism, and capitalism.  One wants to take everything and make it an even playing field thus draining the reservoir of ideas, innovation, and individualism.  The other, Capitalism, wants to fill the reservoir through the very things that liberalism strives to regulate and control out of existence.  Ronald Reagan once said, Liberals believe that if it moves, tax it, if it keeps moving regulate it, and if it stops moving, subsidize it.  This movie portrays how one philosophy leads to economic ruin through the stagnation of bureaucratic red tape and political correctness while the other, capitalism, through innovation, can bring about a second renaissance, an economic boom that will lift everyone up in its wake as opposed to dragging them down with mediocrity and the ideals embraced by liberalism.  One can conclude that liberalism is about those in power staying in power by keeping everyone else down while manipulating the masses into believing that they aren't to blame for the poverty they have caused.  That capitalism is to blame and therefore is evil and must be regulated, legislated, and controlled.  They hide the fact that their religion is hypocrisy and denial.  That capitalism is the driving force behind the engine of innovation and it is that engine of innovation that propels economic prosperity and individual success, growth and expansion.  That through capitalism people are inspired to thrive and it is that drive to do better that brings everyone up.  Through liberalism however, innovation is starved because capitalism is strangled through regulation, legislation, and corruption thus eliminating the very fuel that drives the economic engine and therefore brings everyone down say for those who are in power.

4844297,4,B005N4DMMG,"I really enjoyed seeing this book come to life on screen.  I loved the choice of actors and it was very well done.  Although I missed some of the main character's great monologues from the book that detail the opposing philosophies, I thought they did a decent job of condensing the meat of the matter.  However, this condensation makes it like so many other junk-food movies today, reducing everything to 30-second sound bites.  I loved the book so I wanted more.  I also found myself wishing the theme music was as magnanimous and dynamic as the main ideas and characters.  It's great that the makers stuck with this despite all the Hollywood opposition.  Of COURSE they didn't want to have anything to do with it, it's true themes are completely antithetical to everything Hollywood pushes out to the public - it directly calls out the blood sucking nature of the left-wing politics Hollywood loves so much.  Wish they'd made the whole movie instead of doing installments, but I can't wait to see the next parts!",1324512000,3,1015,4.76

Then again, given what appears to be the history of the making of film - an ironic (or was it expected?) exodus of cold feet by networks and potential cast members indicative of the collectivist oppression the novel attacked - I am not surprised that the film is limping along in this fashion.  I believe the film could have had the quality of Citizen Kane and still would have found itself in the same situation.  Unfortunately, it isn't Citizen Kane or even close.  The biggest flaw is the dreadful screenplay.  The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, making a very good cast seem wooden, lifeless and preachy.  I thought the novel was superb and agree with most of the sentiments expressed therein, which makes it all the more painful to watch.

4844300,4,B005N4DMMG,"First, let me disclose that I am a libertarian who first read Atlas Shrugged when I was a teenager in the early 60's.

The movie is true to the book. It is an exciting story, with a terrific plot and totally two dimensional characters. While we need to give Ayn Rand credit for writing as well as she did in a second language, Russian was her mother tongue, perhaps the directors of the film could have breathed some life into what seemed like cartoon figures in the film.

All said, I really enjoyed seeing this book made into a movie and look forward to future installments.",1324425600,3,576,4.4245283018867925

Much of the other acting mediocre. Wish they ahd been clear filmed in Southern Coloardo and I think not Granby... found the screenwriter or storyteller's license with locational issues disconcerting... or confusioning.

4844304,4,B005N4DMMG,"The movie itself has a comic book tone. There are villains and heroes. The heroes border on being super-heroes. The plot deals in simplistic superlatives. An industrialist has invented ""the best"" metal ever conceived, a metal whose production could put the catastrophically flagging U.S. economy back on track. But sinister government officials who put the goal of equalizing opportunity and people above sheer individual achievement - conspire to undermine the industrialist's business.

If this movie had in fact been presented as a Disney animated feature, it would have paradoxically been more believable. It would have clearly removed the action to a more mythic realm where titans properly reside. However, having chosen to shoot this film as realism, the producers force their flesh-and-blood actors to move jarringly like stick figure representations of ideas through a naturalistic landscape. The humans are forced to become stereotypes. The heroes are mostly young, attractive, or at least compellingly virile. The villains are older, often bald and paunchy. The one Hispanic character has a shock of incredible dark hair flowing low on his face, the worst hair-do since that of Javier Bardem's in ""No Country for Old Men."" The only African-American actor in the film comes on screen almost as a token in a subordinate role.

George Orwell's book ""Animal Farm"" had some themes similar to those of ""Atlas Shrugged."" It taught that tyranny so easily follows in the wake of ""good intentions"" to equalize everybody. However, when Orwell's book was translated to the screen, the producers rightly chose animation as their medium. That probably wasn't only because the Farm involves so many talking animals. The producers might have realized that parable is more appropriated presented in the abstract.

This movie closely follows Ayn Rand's 1957 novel, only updating the technology available to the characters where absolutely necessary. I admired a great deal of Rand's philosophy, but was usually only able to appreciate her ideas when she presented them directly, speaking in her own voice. When she tried to hang her ideas onto the figures in her fictions, they tended to clank stiffly like coats of armor. In short, I found her novels unreadable.

I started reading ""Atlas Shrugged"" years ago, but couldn't get through its monolithic landscape. The characters and their conversations seemed like concrete abutments. So I never got to find out the answer to the prevailing question in the novel - ""Who is John Galt.""

I hoped this movie would answer that question. But I was frustrated again. This movie is only Part I of a projected trilogy. Part II isn't scheduled to come out for another year. And who knows about Part III. All of which presents another problem. With such a long time between the releases of the sections of this work, how will the producers get the audiences caught up when Parts II and III do appear? There will be the need for some tedious back-pedaling and re-capping. So it might be better to wait to see this when (and if) ""Atlas Shrugged"" becomes available in its cinematic entirety.

As it is, this film just leaves you hanging. Its concluding scene is inexplicable, or subject to misinterpretation, unless you listen carefully to the producer's explanation in the DVD's bonus features.

Those bonus features are generally very worthwhile though. If I give the film itself only 3 stars, I give the bonus features 5 stars (averaging out to the overall 4-rating for the DVD). The extras consist - first, of a serious and intelligent director/producer commentary which includes some interesting appreciation of Ayn Rand's ideas.

Next, when the producers were forced to distribute this film as an independent production, they invited supporters to send in videos of themselves announcing ""I am John Galt."" They show the results. I can't quite say the faces make an American panorama. There are more men than women, and few members of any minority group. I thought I'd get tired of this long segment. Nevertheless, the cavalcade of human faces is fascinating, with each person giving his or her unique inflection to that simple sentence.

The commentators suggest that this movie should inspire you to read the novel. Well again, since I wasn't able to become a fan of Rand's writing, I'm not sure that I would recommend that. I would instead recommend that if anything about this movie's ideas click with you, you might want to explore the non-fiction writings of some other classic libertarian philosophers. Friedrich Hayek's ""Road to Serfdom"" would be a great place to start.",1324252800,2,4611,5.112881806108898
4844305,5,B005N4DMMG,"I've often told my friends that Ayn Rand was not near the writer she thought she was and a far greater philosopher than her detractors can ever imagine.  This truly excellent movie based upon the first third of her so-called masterpiece ""Atlas Shrugged"" proves me out ....  This film is a fantastic example of what D.H. Lawrence called ""the objective correlative,"" that is it dramatically and repeatedly and always distinctively shows rather than tells Rand's remarkable philosophy and thus eliminates the dryness and stiltedness the book too often featured.  For those of you who don't know much about OBJECTIVISM, the Rand philosophy, for us in the United States it would create a very small, non-interfering government that excels at fiscal restraint and follows the intent of our Founding Fathers when they created the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights seeking to create a Constitutional Meritocracy, a republic of virtue and achievement.

That is okay though - it covers 300 pages in 97 minutes. However, to the people who wrote a decent review - you obviously do not understand objectivism. I saw NOTHING in this movie that furthers the ideas of Rand. Nothing that truly explains WHY Rearden can say, ""Well... I am only interested in money.""

NOTHING to briefly explain the battle of Kantianism VS Randism. Via Rands Biography, she is said to have been severely disappointed in the play adaptations of ""We The Living"" and ""Anthem"" because they lost the true meaning of her work - That no man should live for the sake of another. This movie, once again, fails to capture that ideology.

If you hate Ayn Rand - but are smart enough to admit that she was on to something, don't watch this movie - it doesn't do her justice.

If you respect and admire Rand, this movie and its decent reviews are insulting.

4844314,1,B005N4DMMG,"While I am a firm-set liberal, I wanted to read the book to say that I have read it. It was beautifully written, with a lot of wonderful imagery and a great story to tell. I don't necessarily agree with the whole theme of the book and the ideals behind it, but I do think that the population of greedy people that believe the government is there to them to support them has grown exponentially in the last couple of decades. It's not to the point where this book ended up, though.

With that said and the imagery still bouncing around in my head, I was extremely excited to see that SOMEONE had finally gotten the film going. I looked at the production still and saw that the settings were magnificent and the rails and Rearden Metal looked exactly like I envisioned them. So a couple of weeks ago, I saw the DVD at Target and immediately grabbed it. HOWEVER...

Two nights ago I got around to putting it in. I realized immediately that I had wasted my money. There is nothing tying the plot lines together, the character backgrounds are extremely shallow, with some pivotal characters having NO name until 40 minutes later! The director seems to think that Lilian and Hank Rearden have a wonderfully loving relationship. It was hard for me to follow and I had just finished the book in September. It was jumpy, emotionless and terribly thin compared to the writing and detail in the books. I turned it off when the screenplay completely omitted the 3 months that Rearden and Dagny spent traveling the country, meeting the poor people in the village and wound up at the abandonded 20th Century plant. Instead, the movie version had Hank sending someone off to take pictures of the engine that Dagny had originally dug out of the metal scraps to the point of bloodying her hands.

I would NOT recommend this book to anyone looking to see the book jump off the screen. It won't, and you'll be lucky if you get any kind of emotional response out of it.",1323993600,12,1949,4.515580736543909

4844318,2,B005N4DMMG,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I read the book a few years ago and really enjoyed it's story of individualism and responsibility. Unfortunately, the movie not only failed to focus on this part of the novel, but forgot it almost completely, instead becoming a disparate patchwork of transparent far-right politics and reaching philosophical contentions.

While the book itself dragged on at times, using 3000 words when 300 could have worked, I still wanted to see what happened next. With the movie I found myself fast forwarding through the film, trying to find something interesting.

There are a few groups who will dig this movie because it flatters their principles. Far-right conservatives who feel constantly under siege by liberal interests; free market capitalists who believe any regulation is a deadly slippery slope; people who think President Obama is really trying to turn the USA into a Communist or Islamic state; Fans who think that the reason this film flopped critically and commercially is because of a conspiracy of the liberal mainstream media ""scared"" of the bold, liberating ideas of Ayn Rand. All of those people will like this movie. Other than that, man.. It's just really hard to like this flick.

Some positives: While the music wasn't particularly memorable, it was quite pretty and generally fitting. The design of the railway bridge in the Rockies was quite beautiful, and the CGI pretty decent considering it was an independent movie. The acting wasn't too bad either, at least in the case of the actress playing Dagny. But the script was so shoddy that there just wasn't much she could do to save butchered scenes and an uninteresting plot evolution.

Its sad really, if this movie was given the funding it truly deserves it could have been absolutely phenomenal, but as I said it's amazing that it was even made at all.

However, after starting to watch it, I was hooked.  Not only was the acting and story top notch but the similarities to many of our current government views and workings just ran chills down my spine.

The casting of Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart was right on the mark.  It may not have been a high budget film, but it made its point fluently. Of course, it is too short when compared to the book, but that usually happens in making books into movies, especially a book as long as this one.

What was very disappointing was to learn how bad the professional reviews were and how poorly the movie did in the theaters. It deserves much better than that. One reviewer claimed it was too ideological. I am afraid that the real problem was that it expressed a point of view that was out of step with the prevailing ideology of New York and Hollywood. These are the same people who no doubt find that the dark, paranoid visions of Oliver Stone and Michael Moore represent the height of artistic achievement.  Coming out months (or in the case of the book, more than 50 years) before the Occupy Wall Street movement and the opening shots of class warfare, Atlas Shrugged is proving to be prophetic.

The acting really is good, the scenery lush, and the special effects pretty good. Some details are left out that are in the book, one that I thought was important, and that is the two guys talking in the basement cafeteria occassionally, and I wanted Dagney to sift thru a big pile of broken glass and papers for the engine, but all in all it is a great movie and I highly recommend it.  Please please please, let there be a Part 2!!!",1323475200,2,915,4.038888888888889
4844341,2,B005N4DMMG,"Few people would watch this solely for its mediocre ""entertainment"" value. This is politics in story form. Virtually everyone watches it for the political, economic, moral, & philosophical content. Most viewers likely already read Ayn Rand and are strongly polarized for or against her message. I praised her books back in the 1970's but am appalled by how Milton Friedman, the Chicago Boys (economists), and conservatives since Reagan have single-mindedly modeled both foreign & domestic economic policies after the strict essence of her selfish rugged-individualist ideals (without regard to corruption, human rights, militarism, and other factors).

Political conservatives will love this flick, give it 5 stars, and shout ""I told you so!"" Liberals will hate it but might learn a little from it. Thoughtful, non-polarized viewers can watch it from a broader perspective and observe the compulsive, knee-jerk political reactivity of most citizens.

First the good: This accurately, lucidly portrays Ayn Rand's Objectivism. All liberals and open-minded thinking people should watch it both to learn her message (which certainly has merits) and to understand the minds of conservatives. It well demonstrates the virtue of selfishness, greed, and competition and their role in building a great country and also demonstrates (in a blunt, simplistic, heavy-handed manner) the folly in trying to legislate altruism (e.g. welfare) and how government meddling in the name of ""social equality"" is often very counter-productive.

Now the bad: This is truly a ""piece of work,"" unashamedly romanticizing radically conservative values and brazenly bashing humanistic values. Idealogues (e.g. GW Bush & Milton Friedman) and simple-minded folks (e.g. those who voted for GWB in 2004) will be captivated and mesmerized by the overly simplified black & white moral message, and that is why I give it only two stars. It deepens & prolongs the sleep of these rote-conservative simpletons, who are its intended audience. The captains of industry are portrayed as solely responsible for our nation's successes: innovators, job creators, wealth creators, etc. (Trickle down exemplified.) The progressives are totally 100% vilified as purely obstructionist, trying to give away all wealth, remove all market incentives, and drive us all into abject poverty. Being set in a dysfunctional USA only 5 years away (2016), it suggests that these liberals are entirely responsible for all our economic woes and that those heroic corporations and wealthy CEOs are our only hope for salvation, if we would stop strangling them with regulations. Most blatantly backwards are the many scenes where liberals are busily cutting all the dirty back-room political deals while our heroic capitalist titans are morally above such depravities. Wow! The extreme right wing has an amazing capacity for reversing facts! (As illustrated by Orwellian titles like Healthy Forests Initiative, Clean Skies Act, and No Child Left Behind.)

My take-home message: Liberals must learn to apply public policies only at critical choke points, using the invisible hand of the market to carry their effect, so as to avoid perverse incentives and unintended consequences. For example, a simple carbon tax on fossil fuels at the mine or well-head will be far more reliable and predictable than solar incentives, compact fluorescent subsidies, incandescent bans, ""cash for clunkers"", cap & trade, and a gazillion other policies that unintentionally and arbitrarily ""rob Peter to pay Paul,"" as partially illustrated by this movie. Conservatives must learn that the benefits of selfishness and competition do not apply to monopolistic practices (e.g. Microsoft), cooked books (e.g. Enron), corporate subsidies (e.g. oil & corn), tax loopholes (e.g. hedge fund managers), government revolving door corruption (e.g. FDA run by Monsanto or VP Cheney arranging no-bid contracts to his Halliburton), externalized costs (e.g. Walmart instructing its underpaid workers on applying for Food Stamps), and ...THE MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT!

Were Ayn Rand alive today, I wonder if she would approve of the vast trans-national corporate powers, world trade agreements, tax dodges, bank deregulations, and governmental corruptions that have been done in her name.",1323475200,3,4294,5.6
4844342,2,B005N4DMMG,"Be it far from me to insist that everyone read the book before the movie.  I've always believed that film should be judged by its own merits.  While I often prefer not to read the book before the movie, `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atlas-Shrugged/dp/0452011876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atlas Shrugged</a>' gives me an advantage that doesn't preclude the merits of this one.

At the beginning, the dialogue and exposition are so lackluster that I nearly threw in the towel and joined in with the chorus to condemn this film.

For those who are unfamiliar with either the epic book by Ayn Rand or this movie, I'll make it brief:  The U.S. economy is in a tailspin (much like today), and government regulation is allegedly choking all economic endeavor, including the heartbeat of the steel, metals, oil, and railroad industries.  Lined up on one side, are the heroes and heroines who keep the motor of the economy vibrantly working:  Dagny Taggart (femme fatale and one of two heads of the Taggart Railroad industry); Hank Reardon (an Andrew Carnegie-like figure who owns a steel firm), Francisco D'Anconia (an Argentinean copper mogul), and Ellis Wyatt (a Colorado oil tycoon).  On the other side, are the movers and shakers of liberal reform, who are breaking up monopoly ownership.  The head villain (as they're painted in Rand's view) is Dagny's own brother, James, a liberal with ties to the government who destroys the thrust of his family's business.  Wesley Mouch (Michael Lerner), one of the chief antagonists found in the intelligentsia, is on a mission to balance the scales of justice by ripping these industries apart.  In the shadows, lurks the mysterious figure of John Galt, whose presence can only be guessed at, and is the prime mover of Rand's mystery, so flippantly referred to in the ongoing clich question: ""Who is John Galt?""  All the while the movers and shakers are disappearing.  At heart, Galt may be to blame.

Yes, this is a short synopsis.

Taylor Schilling plays Dagny, and while she demonstrates her steely reserve, she doesn't deliver much of her passion. Paul Johansson, self-cast as John Galt, also directs the film.  Where the force of the dialogue and passion of his players is lost, Johansson makes up with some splendidly shot scenes.  Sumptuous indeed is this film to look at, and cinematographer, Ross Berryman, undoubtedly will still have a career after this film. But, the dialogue and whirlwind of consequential events takes traction consequently late in the movie, so late, that the cliffhanger ending will not have enough of the newly initiated caring about 'Part 2'.

As for John Aglialoro and Brian Patrick O'Toole's screenplay, it did not meet the par expectation that books be translated well to the big screen. I am no prude.*  I know that expletives sometimes give the dialogue more punch, but Ayn Rand didn't need to use expletives to give her words more power.  Here they are gratuitous--a method of injecting vitality into their own inadequate screenwriting.  Both the director and writers missed the ball for creating a dramatic delivery. Yes, the party scenes would make the producers of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynasty-Seasons-1-2/dp/B000QUEQ72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynasty - Seasons 1 & 2</a>' green with envy, the cable news headlines are realistic enough, and the shots of autumnal splendor in Colorado aboard a train are worthy of an advertising travel award, but this is not enough.

If Ayn Rand ever saw this film she would shudder.  To paraphrase Barbara Braden in `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-Ayn-Rand/dp/038524388X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of Ayn Rand</a>,' Rand was beside herself over a key line that was changed for the celluloid version of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fountainhead/dp/B002RT2BXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fountainhead</a>' starring Gary Cooper, which compromised the whole meaning of her book.  Imagine her consternation over a production (and Braden did document how Rand so coveted a movie version of `Atlas Shrugged,' which went unrealized partly because of her iron hand) which contained this much mediocrity and with merits for the aspects she would have cared least.

Is there a movie version of `Atlas Shrugged' that would be the libertarians' counterpart to `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grapes-of-Wrath/dp/B0000DJZ8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grapes of Wrath</a>'?  Your guess is as good as mine.

Still, `Atlas Shrugged, Part 1' might be a minor triumph for conservatives looking for a major release that is akin to their beliefs.  (That is why George Clooney will never play Hank Reardon.)  Compared to `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Carol/dp/B00319K188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Carol</a>' there is room for greater satisfaction.  After all, how many times can you watch a Michael Moore-type character get slapped around like it's a `Three Stooges' marathon?

Added to my judgment, I have already peeked at others' reviews of this `Part 1,' and one of the biggest hurdles was to try and erase these biases and write my own review.  In hindsight, I'd say it wasn't much of a hindrance, and I'm, undoubtedly, much kinder than those who went before me.  I do disagree with Roger Ebert's assertion that the love scenes could have shown more because libertarians might like ""thumpy"" as much as the next audience member, but I thought they left more to the imagination.

(*'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordinary-People/dp/B0018RE7GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordinary People</a>' wouldn't have resounded nearly as well without the expletives.  In contrast, `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Boy-Scout/dp/B000HF4TIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Boy Scout</a>' demonstrated the difference between real life and art by making profanity so pervasive that it lost its effect.)

She would have been proud of this film, in my opinion. It's visually beautiful, the actors are incredible and it touches your soul if you believe in Capitalism and individualism.

The music score is beautiful. The entire production is first class.

Having said that, a friend watched it and said, ""I didn't like it."" She simply couldn't grasp it or comprehend it. She hadn't read the book and was not familiar with the Rand philosophy. So, it's possible that only those of us who do understand and appreciate Rand will like this extraordinary movie.

The world just hasn't got enough films of such a simple nature and fine ineptitude of craft, from the swirling, pompous score to the carefully selected and exactly delivered diatribes of dialog, and featuring the best of all phallic allegories of mid-century free-market capitalism, the derailing TRAIN! The outmoded and wonderfully exclusive design is plush in its maleness, despite the appearance of being a story with a strong woman lead character. The ruse just doesn't last or delight any more than a tip of the cap for the ladies, who will surely lap this up with avarice and giddy vacuous glee!

The movie turned out pretty good also.

Granted, Steven Spielberg (and a $100M budget) could probably have made a better movie out of this, but this movie is definitely worth watching.

BTW, the fact that the movie moved the action from 1930th in the book to 2016, plays out nicely too.",1323043200,4,318,4.4655172413793105
4844376,4,B005N4DMMG,"as the negativists! So many of the one-star maniacs' 'reviews' don't read at all like they actually SAW this movie.

Between that, and movie reviews, I was prepared this just wasn't going to be very good. Just goes to show you should realize that so much of the world is so politicized, it's becoming impossible to get an objective (no pun intended, a la Rand's philosophy) opinion of what the movie is about.

Having said that, I really liked this movie. I liked it so much, I'm going to reread 'Atlas Shrugged,' which I read years ago in college. And while I'll probably still skip over some of the long winded parts of Ayn Rand's commentary (the woman could write, but my God, did she EVER need an editor!!), this movie is so spot-on to what is wrong with this country, and the world, that the timing couldn't have been more perfect.

Now to the technical details. I loved the casting. No one has made much of a mention of this, but I think Grant Bowler is perfect as Hank Reardon. His looks are perfect; he's also subtle. Taylor Schilling is fine as Dagney.

The casting of the minor characters is really good as well. I particularly liked Patrick Fischler as Paul (very good cold blooded betrayal there), but I must admit, I adore Graham Beckel. He is absolutely perfect in his role.

The cinematography in this movie is fantastic (a sure sign a reviewer didn't see this movie is when they criticize this!) The score is also perfect.

In fact, the only criticism I have of 'Atlas Shrugged,' and it's a big one, is that the movie is WAY too short. All it did for me was whet my appetite to see MORE of it.

In fact, as it ended I was sore that it had to end without tying up the story, and when Part II comes out I will be sure to see it. I think the casting is spot on.

I believe many of the negative reviews are quite likely people with a political motivation, as I assume the negative reviews from the movie critics were probably derived from the same sentiment...which is a shame.

4844384,5,B005N4DMMG,"I saw the film in the theater and then purchased it on Amazon. The most disturbing part of this film and the book is how accurately it tracks what is happening in our country today.  I live in ""The Peoples Democratic Republic of"" California.  Atlas is definitely shrugging in the golden state.  As government largess grows and taxes on the producers increase and regulations stifle any productive activity the ""makers"" are leaving the promised land and the ""takers"" are taking over. California is on the verge of bankruptcy because of its liberal anti capitalist ideology.  Once flourishing businesses are abandoning the state and the politicians are too stupid (or brain locked) to recognize why.  Once, if a nation, California would have been seventh in the world economy, now it falls behind Greece as an economic power. Ayn Rand foresaw this in the 1950's.  Her life experience in Russia showed her what the collective would do to human existence and what central planning would do to the economy. I just wish there was a John Galt around to show the way and a ""Midas Junction"" offering an escape from the Orwellian nightmare that Progressives and liberals are turning into a terrible reality.  Rand viewed man as a potentially noble being.  She also realized that nobility comes at a price and that price is recognition of the supremacy of the individual over the mob.  Unfortunately few in the world today are willing to pay that price and this is a point that the book and the movie makes very clear and that its critics would rather ignore.",1322870400,5,1548,4.811320754716981
4844385,5,B005N4DMMG,"This is not an entertainment film.  It is a fictional presentation of Ayn Rand's philosophy of rationalism.  Part 1 sets up the premise that our current societal and political structure is both corrupt and anti-achiever.  It introduces the character John Galt.  Who is John Galt?  He is the Atlas who shrugged, closing down his thriving business because of the interference of government that makes it a punishable offense to make money through achievement--particularly if you have not paid off the politicians.  The movie's examples of government interference are actually quite mild compared to recent events.  The Library of Congress rates Atlas Shrugged as one of the two most influential books in history, and this film does a very fair presentation of the first part of the book.  Yet it is the first part of a 3 part series, with parts 2 and 3 due at one year intervals.  There are several interviews with Ayn Rand on YouTube, which are both informative and charming.  I recommend viewing those interviews along with part one of Atlas Shrugged.  The viewer will find these interviews enliven the film.  I can hardly wait for more...Atlas Shrugged had a huge impact on my personal view of life and it may do the same for you.",1322870400,3,1232,4.842105263157895
4844386,5,B005N4DMMG,excellent movie.  True to the book while modernizing.  She was a damn prophet.

4844387,1,B005N4DMMG,"As movies go, this is a bad one. It is about as exciting as watching kudzu infest a gully. If Ayn Rand was alive she would have fallen asleep in the theater. If she was watching it at home she would have put up soundproofing so that she could start screaming without the police arriving. And when the movie ended, if she managed to live through it, she would have then killed herself. And if they make good on their threat to make Parts 2 and 3 you will hear her screaming from the grave. If she actually resurrects herself, which she just might do if she gets angry enough, it will be to bring the cameraman a light meter.

This movie is bad enough for someone like myself who is a former Ayn Rand Zombie. What can it be like for some poor Innocent, however?....someone who just wants to see a movie?...not someone like myself who wants to see if a great book like Atlas Shrugged can actually be brought to the screen? To such a person -- dispassionate, unprepared, having no expectations -- how bad can the pain be to that person? It would have to be almost unendurable. But enough speculation, just what is so bad about it: well, not the sound quality. That is fine. The music? Not memorable but suitably mood-inducing. What is the mood induced?....well, not exactly torpor. Let me think: it does take your mind off the dialogue and the pacing.

And before I go any further, let me answer the question, ""Who is John Galt?"" He is the guy in the hat in the shadows with the terrible vocal inflection and delivery and the brain-shredding pronouncements of plodding, ponderous, ear-clogging profundity, laden with significance and thick with the verbal-communication version of frozen tar.  Oh my Lord. Fortunately these pronouncements are few and each one has a very small word count. Compared to this movie Kathy Lee Gifford is an electrifying, steroid-filled overdose of endless fascination.

If this is a movie, then a Fresno City Council meeting is the Cirque du Soleil. I watched it on a laptop and it took 6 sessions spread out over 7 days. Because I just could not keep going without long rests in between. Fair to say the movie doesn't actually suck the life out of you. It just keeps reminding you that you do, in fact, have a life, and so you turn the movie off periodically in order to get back to it. But then you remember, ""I still have to finish watching Atlas Shrugged,"" and you leave your life for a short time and re-enter the world of the dense cellular compression of existence at 5,000 fathoms in a bathyscaphe that has ceased to function, its walls having disintegrated, the full weight of the sea engulfing you. You re-enter the world of Atlas-Shrugged-the-movie pressing in on you at a million tons per square inch. Your bones begin to snap and crumble and fuse into Rearden Metal and the inside of your head feels as if gunite made of depleted uranium is being forced into both ears by high pressure hoses. Behold, another conversation is taking place at a dinner table or at a gathering or at a snack table or at a garden party or at a buffet table or -- whoa! --  at  another dinner table!  and you know by the feel of the weight of the world on your shoulders that you are back inside the movie Atlas Shrugged. You are in fact Atlas. Perhaps that is the movie's genius: it turns you into the first half of the title. You become Atlas, collapsing beneath a weight far too heavy for you to bear.

If this movie does not win the annual Raspberry Award, it will only be for the reason that no one on the Committee could sit through it to the end. And fair enough, I say. No award for grimness is worth sitting through Atlas Shrugged for. Can Atlas Shrugged actually be brought to the screen at all? Well, sure, if it is a 5-year recurring mini series on television produced by the same people that made, say, Boston Legal, or The Sopranos, or Suits, or The Good Wife, or Madmen -- you know, people with gifts for pacing and dialogue and drama and maybe even the occasional moment of EXCITEMENT!!!!!! Then it could be, sure. In fact there wouldn't even have to be actual excitement involved to make a better production than the movie was: moments of REM sleep would be an upgrade. In fact, again, in fact, If hospitals ever run out of anesthesia, during recovery periods where absolute oblivion is required of the patient, long months of induced coma could be achieved by attaching wires transmitting Atlas-Shrugged-the-movie directly into the skull. Many lives could be saved. So there are some positive effects to be derived from this picture.

I understand that there are people who have sat through this slow scrape of fingernails down a chalkboard more than once. A strange mental exercise that accomplishes nothing can be performed by trying to understand the emotional and psychological status of such individuals. The exercise gets you nowhere, but it gives you something to do while you are watching the movie yourself, the one time that you will actually watch it. And I know you are such a person because the kind of person who would watch it more than once has left this review a long time ago. After the first sentence, in fact. These people are the Ayn Rand version of Trekkies. I don't think they have a name but Randies might do. Or Aynsters. The Aynsters are watching it over and over and over again. Why? I don't know why. But I know that they are. Because they think that Atlas Shrugged the movie is Atlas Shrugged the novel. But it isn't. It is barely any kind of a movie at all. ""Beepo, The Happy Tapeworm"" is more of a movie. And it doesn't even exist. But Atlas Shrugged the movie exists. I have a copy. You want it?

The only complaint I have with the movie is the very end when we actually found out who John Galt was, as this is not revealed until the start of Part 3 in the book.

I have since purchased four additional copies because my own copy goes out on loan, and is seldom returned.  Everyone loves the book as much as I do.  As the past fifty or so years have sailed by I have seen comparisons to the plot.  One that sticks out in my mind is the Microsoft software lawsuit a few years back.  Reminded me of Hank Reardon's new metal formula from the book.  So many other comparable things have happened during the years, it is almost frightening.  If the movie is only half as good as the book, then it is well worth any price you have to pay.  Ayan Rand was the first to recognize the attempt at the NWO (New world order) and played it to it's logical catastrophic conclusion in her book.  And thank you John Gault where ever you are.",1322524800,3,849,4.217391304347826
4844392,3,B005N4DMMG,"I read Rand's novel several years ago and I found the part of the book that this film is based on to be enjoyable. It was long and sometimes plodding, but within the speeches and actions of the main characters lay some of the most compelling and fascinating discussions of the merits of laissez-faire economic principles that have ever been put on paper. While not entiely unenjoyable to watch, the film version isn't quite as compelling. It's relatively well paced, avoiding the plodding nature of its source material, and it contains some very good moments. Unfortunately, it achieves its pace by omitting or watering down the book's essential arguments. The result was to turn an essentially philosophical text into a film whose philosophy is so sparingly argued that its arguments are no longer particularly convincing. That's somewhat of a shame, because this is a story whose sole reason for being was to convince people that its ideas were valid.

Much has been written about the low quality of the sets, effects, music, etc. OK, it's not a blockbuster. It didn't have that kind of budget. But, the film does at least as good a job at these types of things as the average TV miniseries - often better. In fact, they're done well enough that I suspect you'd have to have grown impatient with this film for other reasons to notice any shortcomings.

Much has also been written about the acting abilities (or lack thereof) of the main cast, but I have to say they do a decent job. They're believable. Nevertheless critics may have a bit of a point here. Rand's protagonists are cold and self-serving and yet the novel manages to make them uniquely heroic and even likable. Pulling off that kind of dichotomy is a huge challenge and the actors in the film aren't completely up to it. While they do a fine job of making these characters live and breathe, they don't have the shear force of personality and nuance that tier one actors would bring to them.

Nevertheless, all of the criticisms about budget and acting are essentially minor quibbles. The real problem with this film is probably its brevity. There's nothing particularly heroic about the protagonists here because they overcome the challenges given to them far too quickly and easily. Without seeing the true difficulty of their struggles, the argument that they are entitled to rich rewards for their efforts holds less weight. That element is also missing in the back story. We never see how hard Hank Reardon or Dagney Taggert worked to get where they are at the beginning of the story. We never see the sacrifices involved. That makes it a lot harder to care about whether they actually succeed or not.

Additionally, we see only a watered down version of how awful Reardon's wife is to him in the book. That makes his actions later on in the story a bit less easy to sympathize with.

We also don't see much of James Taggert's statist friends. They aren't really given a proper introduction and they appear infrequently on screen. That makes them very weak villans. In fact, it's hard to remember who they are most of the time. I'm not sure the nature of the threat that they present would be clear to someone who is not familiar with the book.

Having said all that, I must stress that it is still an entertaining film. But, if what you were hoping for was a great film with the power to impact people's philosophy, this almost certainly isn't it.

As for the disc itself, there aren't any noticable problems with the transfer. The special features are not extensive, but what is there is good. They consist of a short, but interesting, making of feature and some production stills backed by an isolated section of the film's score. There's also a commentary track, but I have to admit that I have not yet had the time to listen to this.",1322524800,7,3808,4.691616766467066
4844393,5,B005N4DMMG,"The critics really got this one wrong.  I read the book years ago and loved it.  Consequently, I was both pleased and nervous when I heard it was being made into a movie.  Movies rarely do books justice; especially books this big and full of depth.  When it was finally released, I immediately read the reviews hoping that maybe the director pulled it off.  Based on a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it appeared that he had failed completely and miserably.  Disappointed, I didn't watch it in the theater and only reluctantly picked it up at the movie store when I couldn't find anything else worth watching.  I brought it home and my wife and I watched it non-stop from start to finish.  I was absolutely stunned at how much I enjoyed it, how relevant it was, and how wrong the reviewers were.  Yes, it is pro-capitalist.  Duh.  Ayn Rand was famously pro-capitalist.  That doesn't make the movie bad.  The majority of movies today are incredibly anti-business, industry, and capitalism, so I think a little bit of the other side is fine once in awhile.  I'm pretty moderate politically and don't agree with everything Ayn Rand stood for, but I think she makes a compelling case that deserves a fair look.  This movie was mostly true to the book, captured the feel, modernized the story just enough to make it work, had beautiful cinematography, fantastic musical score, and kept me hooked from start to finish.  I can't believe people complained about the acting.  With the possible exception of a few minor actors here and there, I thought the main cast did a fantastic job and totally looked and acted like the characters I had imagined from the book.  Also, some have complained that the special effects were bad.  First off, there really wasn't many special effects in the movie, so I hardly see why that would even be that big of a deal.  However, the special effects I saw looked just fine.  Actually, I remember commenting to my wife while we were watching that I thought the train sequences looked really good.  I truly do not understand the complaints.  The only gripe I had with the movie at all was that it had to move a tad too fast to really capture everything in the book.  The visit to the train engine place in Wisconsin, for example, was somewhat painfully pushed through, and Hank Readen's efforts to grow his company really weren't deeply investigated.  I can't be too harsh on those things because the movie is trying to capture a huge book in a limited amount of time.  Considering how well made the rest of the movie is, I had to give it a rare 5-star rating.  In fact, I liked it so much that I immediately placed it in my Amazon cart for purchase.  I never pay more than $15 for a blu-ray, but I will happily spend the $20 asking price here.  If nothing else, maybe it will help contribute a little towards encouraging the director to make the other two planned for the series.

Also, while the rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 12% from critics, I think it's interesting that the audience rating on the same website is 79% approval.  Hmmm.  Biased critics anyone?",1322524800,5,3084,4.581352833638026
4844394,4,B005N4DMMG,"My impression of Atlas Shrugged Part 1 is that the film makers really didn't have quite enough money to do it right. Some of the adaptation is really inspired such as making fuel shortages (clearly in the spirit of the book) responsible for railroads being important means of transportation. The acting is competent, but there is a reason that the really big name commands the money they do. Quite simply, they can nail a performance in just a couple of takes. The entire movie feels like the director just didn't have enough takes with less refined actors to get the scenes quite right. Great photography is as much about volume of photos taken, and the artist then has to have an eye to choose the one in a hundred which is worth the work. Similarly a director needs to shoot a lot of scenes (particularly with less experienced actors) to get the right performance.

I very much hope that there has been sufficient commercial success to both make Part 2, and to allow more shooting. I really believe the actors can open up if given more opportunity and the director will be able to do more if he has several times the length of film. Some performances are really spectacular. Hugh Akston and Ellis Wyatt are wonderfully realized. Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden look perfect, and come across as almost painfully reserved. This could really work to the advantage of coming films if they loosen up as the affair takes off.

Everyone who loves the book should buy this movie. The more money it makes the better Part 2 and Part 3 will be. I really do believe that the flaws of the film are 90% budgetary. It should also be noted that Rand can come across as a bit stilted in terms of dialogue. She was a native Russian speaker and that comes through in terms of formality, sentence structure and word choice. You can really see this watching The Fountainhead. Rand herself did the screenplay, and the cast is utterly awesome, with Gary Cooper and Raymond Massey. They are at the top of the craft at that time and even they seem a little uncomfortable with the language, although they tuck that neatly away under excellent delivery. Only Patricia Neal seems totally at ease with the dialogue. In Atlas Shrugged, Wyatt and Akston show the same comfort, everyone else seems to be fighting through an unfamiliar cadence of speech.

In any case, the movie is worth seeing, and definitely worth supporting...for our own sakes of course.",1322438400,2,2427,4.66588785046729

However, since this movie was in the works for a half century, the result is--a joke. I heard that there will be an attempt at a Part II--with a different cast! No. Pull the plug. Cut your losses now and start over again from scratch some day. The people responsible for this pitiful mediocrity are a bunch of Wesley Mouches and James Taggarts. They are INCOMPETENT IDIOTS. The producer seems like a nice guy (in his bonus feature ramble), by Objectivist standards, but he certainly should never have co-written the script. When I read last year that he was co-writing, I knew the project was in trouble. Let's face it: Even Ayn Rand would have been ashamed of this production. David Kelley as a consultant on the film should be ashamed. Get a little objectivity folks. Seen from beyond the borders of the Rand cult, Atlas Shrugged I is fourth-rate soaper.

I have never understood paying athletes millions while making those in the sciences scrounge for money for research.

With that in mind I find the fact that this movie was made to be counter to the ideas of Rand.  As Taggart states in the book, to paraphrase, ""I'm building the John Galt because I intend to make a lot of money"".  This movie did not make a lot of money for good reason.  The story had no structure and the film makers focused on covering the major points of the book and not the story archs of the characters.  Even the dulling of the characters personas, probably to make them more likable, undermines the story.  There are many ways to adapt a book into a movie, one is to stay true to the book, the other is to take the essence of the story and build a film around it.  The film-makers chose to keep to the book material when convenient, cutting the scenes and details which were the essence of ""Atlas Shrugged"".  In summary read the book, this film was made by the likes of James, Orren & their friends.",1322265600,5,1126,4.3238095238095235

That our country and world had to come to the brink of self-destruction before this novel was made into a movie for the masses is the only tragedy. While many details from the book are absent, the heart and soul of the the story of John Galt has made it into this movie.  Maybe if more people had read the book, we would not be in the predicament we are now. Maybe if you watch the movie, there is hope for our future.

4844401,5,B005N4DMMG,I can't think of anything more essential for anyone to take in right now than this film. The parallels to the debate within our country are uncanny. We are engaged in a great controversy over whether the most successful among us benefit both themselves and others or only themselves within the structure of free enterprise. There is a great cry from some quarters to ask of the onepercenters to return more of what they earn and to reign in their methods. This story is a simple warning that we can kill the goose that lays the golden egg. As a limiting case we can look at the failed system of communism. Nobody was allowed to achieve more than another. The result was abject poverty and tyranny. Of course anyone can agree or disagree with the message in this film.

I read the book 40 years ago and it gave me the moral compass to found a company and succeed. It help me find real happiness in life. I think I would have done both without reading the book, but it made it easier. I wish parts two and three of this trilogy were out.

It was good to see the movie was true to the book, even if the movie needed to skip over much. You will get much more out of the book.

4844403,5,B005N4DMMG,"I watched this movie on DVD, so I came with some preconceptions: I more or less assumed that the Rand Fans came to watch in droves during the first week, and after that the movie flopped.  I also read a piece where Hollywood veteran Roger L. Simon basically tore the movie to pieces.

Well, I enjoyed it.  Then again, I don't enjoy the vast majority of Hollywood movies, which strike me as cheap stuff designed to impress very young people for 90 minutes.  Explosions, sex, drugs --- these are things which drive me away.  Ideas attract me, but I suspect they drive most movie-goers away.  Ideas!?  How outrageous!!  Even when these ideas are exactly the focus of the political debate currently going on in the US.

Of course, a lot of movie-goers may have realized this, and rejected the movie because they reject the ideas of freedom, private property, hard work, and self-reliance.

In any case, I found the movie refreshing, if only because it's the first movie concerned with ideas I've seen in fifty years or so, and also because I sympathize with the main characters and despise the villains (such as the happily-named Wesley Mouch).

It seems like we're still trying to deal with JFK's idea: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""

Of course, this has always opened her work to harsh criticism, and it has perpetually been politically correct to attack her work.  But it does force you to think, and this story is particularly relevant to today when we actually see some eerie parallels between her novel and our current trajectory as a country.

For all the alleged intellectual and philosophical contributions, the debate presented so impractically one-sided that it misleads viewers into believing there are no alternatives to Dagny's beliefs.

Atlas' characters have all the depth and subtlety of a comatose beauty queen.  The protagonists are perfect and completely interchangeable self-inserts.  Meanwhile, the antagonists might as well be played by Sauron and his army of orcs.

In fact, I'm not the first to make the comparison:

""There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.""

I'm afraid the same may apply to the movies.",1321920000,5,977,5.430463576158941
4844409,2,B005N4DMMG,"Rand's massive 'Atlas Shrugged' has a following as devoted as that for Hesse's 'Steppenwolf,' and at about the same level of intellectual subtlety. Recent events in the implosion of world-wide banking show just how successful her philosophy of egoism can be, when detached from the high ideals that idealists everywhere seem to take for granted. (In this case, the missing ideal is that people really want to give value for value received - what a quaint notion.) So, we can dispense with the damp philosophy. Unless you're a True Believer.

Taking the movie in itself, it draws on powerful icons: railroads, steel mill, oil refineries, and the other massive achievements of technology and industry. The problem is that, except among engineers, engineering achievements hold little place today's popular interest. Does anyone (outside of a few aficionados, one of whom I know) still admire trains as a symbol of power and progress? Not in the last half-century or so. Likewise steel mills, except among aging memories in the rust belt. Likewise oil works, especially with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill so fresh in mind.

So, that leaves the personal drama. Flat acting among the good guys and 2D stereotypes among the bad guys don't help - and they really do fall neatly into the black and white camps, from which shades of gray have been banished utterly. Dramatic moments, like Dagny's trade for a bracelet fell flat. (No matter what it's made of, couldn't the craftsmanship in it have been held to a higher standard? Imagine US Steel taking on a Tiffany contract, and you'll get the idea.) Then, the obligatory love scene seemed perfunctory. Admittedly, the original involved somewhat a dark kind of passion for my taste, but at least there was a kind of passion. Oh well.

When you take away the movie's philosophical underpinnings, its major symbols, and its characters, what's left? The popcorn, mostly. If you really need to see this one, pick a place with good popcorn.

As a big fan of the book (though not necessarily for political regime reasons), I was skeptical about the adaptation since most movies adapted from books leave me just feeling like I want to re-read the book to recoup my memories.  I was very happy to see that though low budget, the movie hit all of the major steps and kept the sweeping cinematic landscapes that I loved in the book.  The downside of adapting such a long novel is the inability of a movie to have the time to develop the characters and set up certain key pieces of the plot and yet I think the nuances of each main character was well expressed and the dialogue relayed the message without the overly wordiness of the novel.

My husband who has never read the book even said that he enjoyed the movie, was able to follow along and did not think it was boring at all.

Great movie from dialogue to cast, to set and score; great book and can't wait for Part 2!

4844415,5,B005N4DMMG,"Atlas Shrugged is well casted, well directed, and is a very relevant subject.  The liberal media and the generally liberal major movie studios refused to advertise it and run it in their theaters so it was played only in selected theaters and at selected times.  The negative reviews were from liberals that did not like the message the movie depicted.  One of basic government take over of most if not all of our rights.  In the movie, everything is regulated by the government and federal encroachment of our inalienable rights are totally violated. Socialism, if not communism, is knocking on the door of the United States.  Not unlike what is going on today under Obama and his socialistic ideals and as a result this movie based on the book from Ayn Rand is being beaten down by liberal constituents.  In the movie, gasoline prices are near $40.00 per gallon and the only economical way to move goods is via rail which is one of the centers of attention.

The book had many memorable characters...good, bad & caught-in-the-middle sorts; how well would they & their social setting be translated/updated into a film made in the 21st century?

The film maker has captured what is important about Atlas Shrugged: its ideas about freedom, liberty and civilization.  The acting is marvelous in major as well as minor roles; the characters are developed fully, and it doesn't hurt that the actors are very attractive.  The  story is placed in the present; the slightly anachronistic use of the railroad industry (as in the book) really doesn't distract from the film.

4844433,5,B005N4DMMG,"Having read the novel Atlas Shrugged three times so far, and having come to admire Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism as it applies to modern life, I recall that my first thought, upon hearing that the movie Atlas Shrugged (Part I) was being made, was that it is no small task to take the greatest polemical novel ever written and translate it into film, even in three parts as planned.  Given the sorts of things that happen in the world of motion pictures, this could have been a disaster.  But what a relief to see that this film crew, very much in keeping with a Randian work ethic one might say, stepped up to this rather daunting task and brought it off to such high effect.

Technically the movie is impressive in all the right ways--good, tight, tasteful directing, good photography, effective casting.  Taylor Schilling in particular is memorable as Dagny Taggart, and this was a critical requirement for a good film, as the novel's Dagny is one of the most remarkable female characters in all of literature

But much more importantly, this film is true to the world-view of the novel, preserving Ayn Rand's own modes of treatment for the various kinds of personalities involved--watching the film, one is led to disdain for the whiners, losers, phonies, and criminals for whom one has disdain in reading the novel (e.g. the parasites who curry political favor for their pseudo-entrepreneurial activities because they lack the competence to compete honestly in a free marketplace), while one is led to admiration for those people Ayn would admire and want us to admire, i.e. the true entrepreneurs, the ambitious, the intelligent, the responsible, the doers and makers of the world.  The novel reveals the folly of thinking that those who accomplish things in life ""owe"" the fruits of their labors to those who do not accomplish those things, and it was incumbent on the film makers to preserve these ideas as originally treated.  Indeed this all comes through with gratifying clarity in the film.  The original Atlas Shrugged poses fundamental questions about human society, and the film reflects this to a degree seldom seen in this medium.

Altogether, the movie is a must-see.  Bravo to those who gave it to us, and here's hoping for equally successful treatments, when they are made, of Part II and Part III.  Here's hoping, as well, that those who may have seen this film before reading the novel will now be intrigued into reading Atlas Shrugged and observing its uncannily perceptive applications to our world.",1321488000,4,2529,4.899297423887588

Plan on purchasing 3 DVDs as Christmas presents this year.  Great opportunity to share the message with family and friends!,1321488000,3,372,4.257142857142857
4844435,5,B005N4DMMG,"This film was much better than I would have expected from the reviews.

Atlas Shrugged didn't play in my town, and the nearest showing was about 250 miles away.  I had to wait for the DVD.  It was worth the wait.  Now, hopefully, we will only have to wait a year or two for Part 2.

Really good acting by the cast, without a single major star actor or actress in the cast.  The story flowed much better than it did in the book.  (Ayn Rand wrote a good plot, but her characters talked way too much, and she couldn't write a love scene to save her life.  The bedroom scene with Dagny Taggart and Hank Reardon in the movie was tastefully done and without the violence that Rand seemed to associate with sex in her books.)

I look forward to seeing Part 2.",1321401600,7,752,4.166666666666667
4844436,5,B005N4DMMG,"Nicely done.  Given budgetary limitations, I thought the adaptation to modern setting was useful, and well done.
Can only hope they are able to fund it to completion.
Giving it 5 stars when it could have been better?  Well ... additional budget could have made it flashier, but
I'm not convinced it would have made it better.  They could have developed some of the individual characters
more, but ... it's intended to be a a trilogy I believe, and I think It dealt with the indiduals in a reasonable
way given that it wasn't a 4 hour move, and given that it needed to make the points it wanted to make.  It wasn't
trying to further the director's ideas, or the producer's ideas ... it was being faithful to the author's ideas.
It didn't spoon feed the viewer with endless explanation, so people will feel free to misinterpret, and malign the
message, but ... they'd do that even if the entire movie was nothing but explanation.  This felt true to the ideas,
if a bit hectic in the pace (when reflecting on the book ... like a cliff notes version.)  Glorious to see it finally
on the screen.",1321401600,7,1090,4.47979797979798
4844437,4,B005N4DMMG,"I've read Atlas Shrugged, and I too read negative review after negative review of this movie. Many of those reviews were obviously written, not to critique the movie itself, but rather Ayn Rand's philosophy. Many critics seemed not to understand her philosophy and skewed her ideology. Rand would have been just as against large corporations who allowed themselves to be bailed out by government as she would have been against rich people who created laws that from the surface appeared helpful to those less fortunate, but upon further observation, actually harm the least fortunate. She was not about wealth, but about the individual and all the promise that one person can encompass. She was about pride - pride in whatever it is that you do because the one can, and often does, make the difference. She saw what collectivism did - what group think did - as she grew up in Russia. So, Rand was not about greed, nor about wealth, she was about the one and the one cannot be free if he/she is subjected to a government that creates a dependent society. Then, the one becomes a slave to the needs of the many - and in Rand's novel she provided an escape hatch - one that might have many producers, as she refers to them in her book, (both wealthy and poor) considering as we watch bank bailouts, nationalized healthcare, and over-reaching federal policies rob its citizenry of choices. She provided us a glimpse of what could happen if...all those big corporations, rich productive entrepreneurs just walked away. For those that love to blame the rich, Rand offers you one possible scenario. And in her world, producers were men and women who worked hard from the bottom up. Producers were not rich folks who inherited daddy's fortune and then sat around smoking with a cognac in hand, nor were they poor people who expected hand-outs from government.

With that said, I still didn't expect much from the movie because the book is extraordinarily complex and rich, with thought provoking dialogue, emotionally vibrant characters, and difficult economic ideas that took over a thousand pages for Rand to lay-out. Needless to say, I purchased this expecting very little.

Surprisingly, I was very pleased with the adaptation. Yes, they had to drop a lot of the dialogue, but remarkably, they were still able to deliver the gist of the plot in under 2 hours. I am honestly looking forward to part two, and I hope they are able to fund it and produce it. I thought Hank Reardon was well cast as was Dagney Taggert.

Someone mentioned the score - it didn't bother me at all. I didn't notice it. I did notice the acting, which pleased me, and the script, which as I've already said, surprised me.

I would suggest this movie for those who enjoy thinking about and pondering over our world, our system of government, and how we the citizenry play a part in shaping those realms. If you are looking for glitz, chick flicks, or something you can get up and get popcorn without missing anything, pass this one up. It's not for the casual movie goer, or the lazy watcher. It demands your attention and your involvement. My thirteen-year-old son enjoyed it very much, but he is fascinated by government and economics AND trains!",1321401600,13,3216,4.747763864042934

I thought this movie was OK but I really loved ""The Fountainhead"" - it was a hoot. However, as a Catholic, I view Ayn Rand's polemics of Selfishness to be morally evil & ultimately unrealistic - if all the geniuses left America & founded their own exclusive country, which she had proposed - who would do the farming, manufacture cars, stoves, clothing, & other such grunt work that successful business people relegate to the ""lower classes""? What happens if an offspring has physical or mental disabilities & don't become geniuses within the community - infanticide?

4844441,4,B005N4DMMG,"This movie is strangely refreshing to me because it is not a Hollywood production, it features no movie stars, it's incredibly well cast, and it's a good adaptation, no more and no less, of ATLAS SHRUGGED the novel, Part I.

The preview gave me little inkling of how enjoyable the movie is. Taylor Schilling projects intensity simmering under self-control as Dagny Taggart, Grant Bowler projects both quiet strength and weary patience as Hank Rearden, and Jsu Garcia brings low-keyed charisma to his few scenes as Francisco d'Anconia. Graham Beckel is considerably older than Ellis Wyatt in the book, yet makes the role very much his own. Rebecca Wisocky absolutely nails Lillian Rearden. Matthew Marsden as James Taggart, Edi Gathegi as Eddie Willers, Jon Polito and Michael Lerner as Orren Boyle and Wesley Mouch--all are convincing in their roles and I want to see ALL of them in the same roles in Parts 2 and 3.

I've left one star off my rating because the role of John Galt is overdone in this movie--not visually, but aurally. He looks good in diners, but he talks too much outside of them. To my mind he shouldn't talk at all in this part of the story. But I have no other quarrel with this movie.

ATLAS SHRUGGED Part I does not pretend to be the same experience as the book, but follows the book closely enough to remind me of reading the novel many years ago. Back then, in the 1960s, I mentally cast Diana Rigg as Dagny and Patrick McGoohan as John Galt. Surprisingly, the first movie version hasn't spoiled that old dream, but rather given me a new experience of the story. I much prefer this production of ATLAS SHRUGGED to the 1940s Hollywood version of THE FOUNTAINHEAD, which was not as well cast and comes across as semi-hysterical. On the other hand, I've found this 2011 independent movie enjoyable in repeat viewings.",1321315200,12,1838,4.701863354037267

There's a man who is unhappily married, there's a single woman who gets involved with him (a cliche), and the economy is in turmoil. If you watch movies to forget whats happening in the real world, skip this one and see Hangover.

I bought into the fantastic movie reviews....watch the trailer and see if its for you.  Oh, this is part 1. I have no idea why, there isn't much in part 1 that it should've ran this long.

The movie was competent (the cinematography was excellent), the acting was much better than some of the reviews here indicated, and Taylor Schilling was terrific. One huge gaffe - the DVD case text boasted a movie based on a, ""novel of courage and self-sacrifice."" Seriously, did the marketing folks ever read the book?",1321315200,5,405,4.970588235294118
4844444,2,B005N4DMMG,"I'll admit that I watched this film with a bias; I am a dedicated fan of the novel Atlas Shrugged and it's one of the best stories I've ever read. That being said, I firmly believe that there is a reason this tale has not been made into a film before now, and that is because it is nearly impossible to do the novel justice.

The movie began with absolutely no backstory at all, and while the depictions of a United States in the middle of economic turmoil are compelling, there was so much more to it that couldn't be brought to film. The novel is twelve-hundred pages long, split into three parts, and to try and squeeze so much of it into a ninety-minute film is just awful. It is loaded with unnecessary and confusing dialogue, dated technology (Ayn Rand wrote about steam engines and corded phones, and I think it should be left that way), and characters with none of the fire as their written versions.

Francisco D'Anconia, rather than coming off as the smooth playboy with some sneaking ulterior motive, was depicted as a lazy drunk with nothing better to do than make excuses. Hank Rearden was not given the explanation for just how hard he worked to invent Rearden steel, and thus came across as a ludicrous businessman who abused his family. And Eddie Willers, rather than being Dagny's right-hand man and confidante, was reduced to a flimsy secretary. Not to mention that names were thrown around entirely too loosely, so that we had no idea who Ellis Wyatt was from Orren Boyle because they were just unimportant men.

I love the novel, and I think that a miniseries over the course of ten or twelve hours would have given more justice to the story. It's a delicate storyline with a lot of information, and this is just an example of Hollywood trying to shorten a classic tale to get it across to the general public. It could have been done better.",1321315200,7,1861,4.532738095238095
4844445,5,B005N4DMMG,"Being a big fan of Ayn Rand's great novel Atlas Shrugged, I expect a less-than-stellar movie version of the book. Happily, I was very pleased with the first installment of the film.

With the length and scope of the story, it requires either an incredibly long movie or a division into different parts, which they decided to do here. While I've heard plenty about the overall low budget of the film, it is still very well done and they spent some good money on CGI effects for the John Galt Line. Taylor Schilling is actually very good as Dagny Taggart - she projects the high-end efficiency and passion of the character, and she is appropriately sexy as well. Grant Bowler as Hank Reardon turns out to be a decent choice as well.",1321315200,3,730,4.53030303030303
4844446,1,B005N4DMMG,"""I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."" ~ John Galt

Ayn Rand's brilliantly titled mystery novel was first published in 1957 to poor critical reception.  Rand's peon to her self-named philosophy of ""objectivism"" has been translated into more than a dozen languages including Mongolian.  It remains a constant seller.

Rand's overt themes, endlessly expressed in the words and actions of her characters -- rejection of God, altruism and any moral code -- shifted her identity in the public mind from the popular fiction writer of THE FOUNTAIN HEAD to contemporary philosopher.

True believers of Rand's philosophy embraced the movie that covers about the first third of her epic novel.  But average moviegoers and critics were united in their disdain -- which I share.

This low-budget vanity production is lacking in the things that make movies work.  When a story has an agenda beyond entertainment, it starts to spiral into a morass of ennui and boredom.  One person told me that she thought the global economic mess we find ourselves combating is a result of thinking like Rand where selfishness and greed are praised as true expressions of freedom.

And now word is the production company is recalling the original packaging that reads: ""AYN RAND's timeless novel of courage and self-sacrifice comes to life...""

Producer Harmon Kaslow,  top dog at Atlas Productions said: ""As we all well know, the ideas brought to life in Atlas Shrugged are entirely antithetical to the idea of `self-sacrifice' as a virtue. Atlas is quite literally a story about the dangers of self-sacrifice. The error was an unfortunate one and fans of Ayn Rand and Atlas have every right to be upset... and we have every intention of making it right.""

So it appears that the new DVD and BD cover will state: ""AYN RAND's timeless novel of rational self-interest comes to life...""

It might be noted here that Rand, a heavy smoker, thought anti-smoking warnings were a communist plot.  She underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 and died of heart failure on March 16, 1982.  Her books have had a recent resurgence in popularity.  Even so, the movie adaptation of ATLAS SHRUGGED - the first episode of a proposed trilogy -- remains a dud.

The recent capture and killing of Ghadaffi reminded me of what can happen when one pursues a philosophy of ""Objectivism.""  He died with assets of over $200 billion and ended up on display in a meat locker.  Imagine if he had actually served his people and made life better for all in his oil rich country.  Altruism can win in the end because is helps the species survive.",1321315200,8,2679,4.780434782608696
4844447,3,B005N4DMMG,"This story is about the ideal of Capitalism.  Novelist, Ayn Rand was known for this.  The heros of society are the hard working, innovative industrialists.  They are the ones who create the inventions that improve the standard of living for all.  And yet, the majority is ungrateful and try to take away the wealth of these creators by government controls.  This is the plot and theme of Atlas Shrugged.

Ayn was born, educated and raised in Russia.  She saw the evils of Marxism and how the creators in society were not rewarded, but rather punished by the government and the collective state.  However, Ayn brought with her the Marxist ideas that religion was the opium of the people.  As we look at the results of atheistic states like Russia and China, we see a total lack of human rights, followed by 100 million dying in death camps.

So it is very odd to embrace capitalism, but reject the altuistic teachings of Jesus. Capitalism w/o Jesus is also evil and leads to slavery or forced 12 hour day, 6 day a week work schedules. Consider Scrooge or old man Potter from It's a Wonderful Life as good examples.

In Ayn's perspective, the industrialists are the heroes and the people are the mob of thugs. But from God's view, all are made by God in His image. Each person is important. Thus in America, ""All men are endowed by their Creator, with...rights."" Thus, we have a ""Bill of Rights"" in our Constitution. Jesus would want us to be creative, work hard, prosper and be generous. In contrast, Ayn Rand wrote another book entitled, ""The Virtue of Selfishness."" This is an oxymoron. It is like saying the virtue of adultery!

Thus, I am addressing Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged and her philosophy behind her novel.

I think Capitalism is the best form of economy in that it creates an ever higher standard of living for the most amount of people. I love my Dell Computer and Microsoft Operating system, my Dakota 4WD pick up, my AOC flat screen HD TV, my Martin Guitar, my Levi jeans, my Cabela explorer shirts, Southwest Airlines, Hallmark and Disney movies, Marie Callendars and Starbucks coffee...and a million other fine businesses...

Here in America, we have more people that identify themselves as Christians, than any other country on earth. This is why we have the maximum amount of individual freedoms, the greatest amount of innovations and the most generosity of any other nation. But Capitalism w/o Jesus is more like the people that cheat the system and produce nothing, like Wall Street's Gordon Gekko or George Soros or Al Gore or Michael Moore.",1321315200,6,2562,4.740990990990991
4844448,1,B005N4DMMG,"I read the book 10 years ago and enjoyed it.  Rand gets her message across in an entertaining way although there are places where the book becomes a bit of a lecture.

There is plenty of material in the book to make a great thriller movie.  People disappearing, the mystery of ""who is John Galt?"", the government and union bad guys doing their bullying, Dagny trying to get the railways working, and much more.  Lots of plot lines, lots of possibilities for action and intrique, and a chance to do a little educating about economics along the way.

The movie did not capture any of those possibilities.  This movie is boring,  the ""keep your finger on the remote jump forward button"" type of boring.  The movie is filled with a lot of talk in dark boardrooms or dark restaraunts or dark cars.

With the political situation, the timing is perfect for this movie and subject, there was a ready audience of people wanting this to be a good movie, and the film makers blew it.  I was excited about the movie and pre-ordered it.  I wasted my money and time.

4844450,5,B005N4DMMG,"To turn Ayn Rand's epic novel into a movie is a major challenge. I expected it would be set, as the novel was, in the thirties or forties. The adaptation moved it into the near future which surprised me yet it actually worked very well. The acting was great, and the Dagny character is fantastic. She perfectly depicts the tough business woman that brooks no nonsense yet, at the same time is sexy and attractive. Ditto for the Hank Roark character who exemplifies the titanic struggle of the creator against the mass of the state. That there are parallels with current affairs only makes the timing perfect.
If I have one criticism to make is that the movie seems rushed. The bedroom scene of Roark and his wife, important to set the basis for his (sexual) relationship with Dagny, is so short that you may miss it and if you do, it may change the way you view Hank. I would have preferred a slightly longer treatment of the story although, for today's audiences, this faster pace might actually be better received.
Ignore the bad reviews. Who cares what the Bertram Scudders say. The reason professional reviewers trash this movie is the same reason it wasn't made by any big name Hollywood director, who would have destroyed it anyway. It is also the same reason Ayn Rand could not find characters to play ""We the Living"" when she tried it to produce it as a Broadway play. Even those who, like Barbara Stanwick, had at first asked for roles in the play, had to back out under threats from the actors union because the union did not like the topic.

It's hard to find a good story.  Atlas Shrugged is certainly that, but it is also much, much more.  Ayn Rand's ability to come up with a story is marvelous, but it is the genius of HOW she tells a story which is absolutely remarkable.  This genius is obliterated completely to shreds in the movie.

I understand the limitations of the screen format, but if such an injustice could have been foreseen in the slightest, then this movie should have not been attempted.

I would suggest listening to Atlas Shrugged the audio book recorded by Christopher Hurt.  Alone, he manages to out-perform every actor in this movie.",1321228800,8,837,4.490066225165563

""Atlas Shrugged"" was Rand's magnum opus; her perfect blend of philosophical writing and romantic realism. I never anticipated that it would translate well into film, or that a filmmaker who undertook it would respect the thematic elements necessary to the development of the storyline. Thankfully, the screenwriters and director seem most familiar with Rand's novel and do their utmost to make sure the translation to celluloid is accurate; while making it entertaining.

I went to see it on opening day and had to walk out of the theater. To describe all the things that are wrong with it would take too long and wouldn't be worth the effort. Many people are so in love with the book and the philosophy behind it that they are willing to fool themselves into believing this movie has anything to offer. They do a disservice to the ideas they are so in love with by trying to lift this movie up on any kind of pedestal. I wish more people would quiet their zeal long enough to stop and think.

4844455,5,B005N4DMMG,"This is a stark, blistering dark comedy that delivers its central message with aplomb. It is a brilliant, unapologetic cautionary polemic about the dangers of unchecked greed and selfishness.

This film is an instant classic for me! I may even read the book the movie is based off of for more. Ayn Rand, whom I've no prior knowledge of, has written a scathing take-down of the selfish, materialistic ideology of the post-agrarian industrial era.

If you want to know what's wrong in America today, take one look at the protagonists of the film. Taggert and Rearden lack all moral foundation and are obsessed with wealth, yet they cleverly disguise their greed as the very morality they lack. These are complex characters with deep, deep emotional flaws. The movie, as if shot through their perspective, allows the audience to see a third-person view into their paranoia. We literally see their inner fears manifest through the supporting cast's actions! I've not seen this level of terminal paranoia so accurately captured on film since Kubrick's telling of ""The Shining.""

Additionally, the mysterious ""John Galt"" is a brilliant plot device. ""John Galt"" represents our own fear of mortality, as the disappearing characters represent the death of the id, or the death of the self. As each tertiary character disappears to the question ""who is John Galt?"", the protagonists lose more of themselves. As the question remains unanswered, the characters proceed further and further into their own madness, losing more and more of what makes them human. Their only solace is each other.

4844466,5,B005N4DMMG,"This film is truly great, I was concerned that it would be over acted because of the trailer and I did not really know the cast, but each actor is totally convincing, the pacing is good and the slight variation to update the story works well. Even though it is a novel about ideas and not explosions, it keeps your interest and even has a powerful ending -- despite the fact the story has 2 more parts to go. Liberals hated this film before they saw it, just as they hated the novel without reading it, because they do not want anyone to believe that man can be heroic, creative and self-sufficient - not needing the big government favors and hand-outs, which are extorted from those who are truly productive.  After all, why would liberals want it recognized that man's role is to create and not to parasitically live off the blood, sweat and tears of those who do -- like them, their voters, and those parasitic corporations that are in bed with them and pay no taxes on $14 billion in income due to special tax favors. This used to be a place where the creative and hardworking people could produce and enjoy the results without their efforts being crushed by governmental regulations and their rewards being bled away for the benefit of slackers who vote for more hand-outs. The liberal game plan was identified over 200 Years ago by Alexis de Tocqueville when he wrote that: ""A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. . . . The American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money."" Modern liberals did, however, expand upon the plan de Tocqueville identified by spending not only the taxpayers money to buy votes, but also borrowing trillions of dollars more that they could expend to expand their political power. How can anyone doubt we are now at the tipping point: with 47% of all Americans now paying no taxes, or receiving more from the government than they pay in, and almost 15 trillion dollars in debt that must be repaid by our children and grandchildren?
The liberals did everything they could to block this film in Hollywood, failing that they now criticize and ridicule it in their reviews - their fear is palpable - when you contribute nothing of value and your existence parasitically depends on expropriating the rewards earned by others, you must dread that they will become aware of your treachery before it is too late. It was 200 years ago that Alexis de Tocqueville wrote those words, predicting that our democracy would not survive beyond the average 200 year lifespan, and the liberals are now using everything at their disposal to make his prediction come true. H. L. Mencken famously wrote: ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" Even he would be shocked at what the liberal media has sold to the American people : by portraying liberals as compassionate, caring people - when all they do is take tax money from the people who are the most productive and use it to buy votes, by giving it to whatever groups will vote for them or whatever corporations will contribute to their campaigns. The liberal runs for office promising to give voters other peoples' money, while the Conservative promises to let voters keep more of what they earn for themselves - the latter message used to resonate with the real Americans who built and defended this country, but far too many voters today are seduced by the prospect of getting other peoples' money and voting for redistributionist candidates - ignoring the fact that they are now enslaving their children with the increasing debts they create. Some compassionate, caring people! This film comes out at a portentous time in our history, it would be sad if the liberals succeeded in burying it. Everyone should see this film and judge for themselves.",1321056000,9,4247,4.817808219178082

Moving on.
""Atlas Shrugged"" was beautiful to watch.
My eyes were not punished by the camerawork, and that was an instant boost in my opinion. The writing and acting were on a much more subtle level than what the attention deficit disorder generation is accustomed to. In some ways, it reminds me of the nuances in ""Watchmen"". To catch everything, takes repeated viewings.
After watching the DVD several times, I find that repeated viewings are still entertaining. I can take the time to catch fleeting emotions, and appreciate the skill of the actors.
I eagerly await II and III. Perhaps they should just skip the theatrical release and go direct to DVD... at least we won't have to wait for months, and the producers won't have to waste money on promotion.
Do we really need to cater to theaters?

4844470,1,B005N4DMMG,"I am a huge fan of Atlas Shrugged, and this movie doesn't come close to doing it justice. The film actually made the heroes look like self-absorbed greedy bastards. It never showed flashbacks to the struggles that Hank went through to produce Reardon Metal... the sweat equity and personal sacrifice that any of the heroes went through to get to where they are now. They didn't enable the audience to feel the pain of what happens when someone takes away something you have devoted your entire life to creating.

Atlas Shrugged is a philosophy book about ethics, morality, values and purpose, and this movie was a poor caricature of of the book. It took the basic plot-line but dropped everything that gave it meaning. I almost stopped watching it after the first 15 minutes or so; the acting was poor, it was stilted and scripted... it gets slightly better as you get into it, but the best actor in the world would have had trouble bringing this superficial storyline to life. And speaking of acting... what's up with the casting? I agree with one reviewer that Dagny looks like a Barbie Doll. Can you imagine any of these people on the cover of Forbes? Come on.

Bottom line, I'm embarrassed for this movie. I'm embarrassed to tell anyone I'm a fan of Atlas Shrugged knowing that if they see this movie, they will likely form a terrible impression of anyone who says that they like it.",1320969600,21,1387,4.634146341463414

But it's been worth my time--and it will be worth your time.  How many romantic, heroic, and scientific/technical movies have ever been made?  Not many, which is why translating Ayn Rand's magnum opus to the big screen (and now the little screen) is so important.  The script follows the novel very closely, which is fortunate because long-time Objectivists have always been concerned that the philosophical spirit of the novel would be lost.  Casting, to my eyes, is picture perfect, as is the acting.  The action is very swift, and if you blink you'll miss an interesting detail (like the sign on Dr. Hugh Akston's diner, ""Akston's Halfway House Cafe""). The computer-aided graphics, by Stargate, are excellent--I particularly like Hank Rearden's bridge design.  It's no wonder that so many scientists, engineers, and business managers have been such big fans of Ayn Rand--there are so very few novels or movies that exalt these professions and laissez-faire capitalism. Let's hope that the producers and directors, as well as the cast and crew, can do the same excellent job for Parts II and III.

4844474,1,B005N4DMMG,"The book, Atlas Shrugged, is a timeless masterpiece. A must read for all would-be entrepreneurs and start-up founders. However the movie followed the current Hollywood trend of using gender neutral actors. I (apparently I'm in the minority) like actors that radiate a sexy masculinity if they are male (Sean Connery,Clint Eastwood, Robert Downey Jr.) and sensual femininity if they are female (Sophia Loren, Catherine Deneuve, Renee Russo), thus making any attraction that they are suppose to have for each other in the movie, believable. The only person I could see the character who played Hank Reardon, fall in love with was himself and the Dagny character looked like yet another sexless Barbie doll. Oh why, oh why has gender gone out of style?

Of course I'll watch Atlas Shrugged Part Two because the book is so amazing that even with the bad acting, some of the brilliant ideas of the book somehow slipped through in Atlas Shrugged Part One.

4844475,3,B005N4DMMG,"Due to the content of several negative reviews here of this film, I must self-disclose: Only after viewing this film, my first exposure to Ayn Rand since the onset of amnesia from a brain injury, have I come to see just how much of my personal philosophy and my own attempts at fiction is inspired DIRECTLY by Rand. Before that brain injury, I had read ""Anthem"", ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" and obviously had related quite closely with her characters and her philosophy. I disagree with much of her argument for objective reality and her moral path to clear perception of the truth but I've reached many of her conclusions about the cult of mediocrity and the sovereignty of individualist heroes through other argumentation.

That said, this film suffers from a similar problem as the novel. It's wicked boring. None of the characters are interesting, natural, or engaging as humans. They are icons - like illustrations in a technical manual, that work as demonstrative premises for Rand's radical philosophy. Furthermore, the dialog is stiff and delivered coolly, with little emotional range or depth. These weaknesses made it close to impossible for me to pay attention and I had to watch the film in portions with long breaks in between each. Now, of course, the injury I mentioned affects my attention, making my its span brief but I am quite able to watch five or six consecutively viewed episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" or all 8 Harry Potters with little trouble because I care about the characters. Even though ""Atlas . . ."" has neither wand showdowns nor exploding meth labs, I'm certain it could have kept my attention if it had beefed-up the human drama in the story. It was still cool to see Edi Gathegi and Armin Shimerman, two of my favorite actors from speculative-science TV and film, though. Also, I'm certain to tune in for parts two and three since Rand is important to me.",1320969600,4,1898,4.822085889570552
4844476,1,B005N4DMMG,"Damn, this is one boring movie.  Ignore the good reviews, they're from cult members who support the movie despite how dreadful it is. The plot, what we've seen of it, is silly. The acting is mostly atrocious (particularly from the two nobodies who got cast as the leads). The characters are razor thin. The dialogue is up to the par of Snoopy writing his novel, ""It was a dark and stormy night."" And it looks cheap and underfunded.

As to the content, I love the review of Mr. Kevin Burnett, who specifically mentions that the film has no comedy whatsoever. However, he goes on to write that the film is erudite, smart and philosophical. To paraphrase Mark Twin, it seems to me far from right for Mr. Burnett to venture an opinion on this movie without having seen it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have seen it.

If, by ""erudite,"" you mean having or displaying great scholarship, being learned (the generally accepted definition), then you'll have to dismiss this movie from its science (it features a form of steel that will stay solid and have its full tensile strength at--wait for it!--5,000 degrees C) to its business acumen (despite the existence of airplanes, the biggest businesses are--wait for it!--the railroads) to its geography (there is a scene where they're driving through the desert in--wait for it!--Wisconsin).

If, by ""smart,"" you mean displaying sharp quick thought, you'll have to dismiss this movie, as its characters go a long way out of their way to avoid thought. Each character, in precisely the way people don't, is established as having one and only one characteristic and go through the movie exhibiting just that single characteristic (and absolutely no others!) without stopping to think, ever.

And if, by ""philosophical,"" you mean of or pertaining to philosophy, well there you miss the rung by solid miles.

Rand was not a philosopher. She had one thought, which she bludgeons you over the head with, again and again, as if repeating it would somehow make it into a philosophy. This movie successfully duplicates that effort. Rand's thought was that the world is suffering from a terrible lack of selfishness, so we should do exactly what we want to do, at all times.

I came away from the movie surprised; surprised at why it got bad reviews and surprised it didn't do better at the box office despite the bad reviews.

For certain, if you're looking for a movie with explosions, action, comedy, gratuitous sex or horror, you're not going to find Atlas Shrugged worth watching, but if you're looking for an erudite, smart and philosophical movie, Atlas Shrugged hits the mark.  The complaints about poor production are so wrong it logical to assume it ideologically driven.  The acting it convincing and realistic; anyone who's worked for a successful, self-made business person will quickly recognize the character of ""Hank Reardon"".

With that said the movie was as great as it could be with the budget (10m$) and actors who they hired.

I REALLY liked Wyatt, who even though he was supposed to be young, was played by an older guy who made you feel like he really did own his property and recognize why that is imortant.

Dagny's character is played by a a beautiful and well spoken actress capable of playing the role, and did.

Reardan's character was probably my favorite, the actor who played him did an awesome job and made me really feel like hes a man who deep down knows whats right but plays to often by the rules of those around him.

I didn't particularly like the actor who played Fransisco, he pulled the playboy act off WAAAY to easy and didn't ever seem to convey even a hint of cultured aristocracy which I expected to come up more often.

I could go on and on. But besides the above I have nothing particularly negative to say about the actors, most played their parts well and did a fine job.

The philosophy comes out at times, but is never ""in your face"" like in the book, which disappointed me a bit but I expected as much -the philosophy is extremely complex to those without the proper understanding of how Rand used many words and idea, I'm no snob -this is just a fact-. To be honest, I hope this movie drives people to read the book, since that is FAR more important and will always convey the philosophy better. But if your looking to get your fix and want to see heroic romantic idealized achievement then this movie will at least give you that in small amounts.

The CGI was done by the same people who do the CGI for Stargate, but its quality where it was used was fantastically done even if it did come off as feeling a little like ""made for TV"".(Anyways, I like Stargate:)...so... ). The scenery was well picked and I never felt like something needed to be done really different to convey the feel of the book.

1 con I would really like to mention: Why would you allude to ""Atlantis""...why would you give away or give so much of one of the most important secrets in the book away like that? Honestly this was my biggest complaint.

Look, I wish Leonard Peikoff, or even better, Ayn Rand, were on the set advising and signing off on all scenes along with a 50M$ budget for each part, oh and make each part 4 hours long. But that didn't happen and sadly probably never will (I will pay 50$ for a ticket to see that FYI). But all in all this movie pulled off roughly the first third of the book rather well.

First because unlike so many of the movies produced now-a-days which are either poorly made and heavily revised rip-offs of earlier works; heavily dependent upon super FX to carry them; and generally Leftist propaganda plays... Atlas Shrugged outshines them all like a diamond among so much charcoal.
It's interesting how a movie based on a book written in 1957 could be so relevant for today as to make it ""prophetic"" in it's portrayal of an America brought low by the machinations of sleazy socialists, aided & abetted by depraved incompetents at every level.
Having said that, I can well understand now why the ""gate-keepers"" of the movie industry have treated it with such disdain.

The acting in it is excellent! Taylor Shilling and Grant Bowler have a subtle ""chemistry"" which is very effective. My only disappointment is the brief sexual encounter in the movie, which really wasn't necessary, and thankfully showed no genitalia.

According to most information I've obtained, this is to be a 3 part production with the next installment due out sometime in November 2012. I will await that with great anticipation.

Really, the only book-turned-movie, in recent memory, that engaged all my senses was Silence of the Lambs. The richness of the characters and the subject matter were equally gratifying in the book and movie version.  But I digress.

I have waited a long time for this movie to become a reality. I had first heard that Angelina Jolie was considered for the part, maybe that was only wishful thinking for those Atlas lovers like myself. Angelina would have brought to the table an overt, intellectual and emotional coolness with a deep, passionate undertone that defines the character Dagney Taggart as a person. And make no mistake, this is a Dagney Taggart movie.

And therein lies the crux of my disappointment. I felt like I was watching the cliffnotes version of Dagney Taggart or maybe a better analogy...I felt like I was snacking on a cheese whiz appetizer instead of settling down for a sumptuous 5-course dinner.  Dagney Taggart was the cheese whiz in this movie. The table setting was correct, the guests were attractive, but the dinner menu and conversation was ultimately lacking in substance. I left the movie still hungry and definitely, intellectually unsatisfied.

Atlas Shrugged, the book, is a sumptuous 5-course meal with witty and enlightening dinner conversation.  Atlas Shrugged, the movie, well...I don't think I will RSVP for Part 2 unless they hire a better chef and party coordinator.",1320796800,10,1557,5.011627906976744

it wasn't as amazing as the book--by far. i am being a realist here. but  this movie has been dragged through the mud and is a LONG time coming. 50 mil would've made an A-lister actor movie, but for 10 mil... ok. i hold that it deserved better than that. MUCH better than that.
this movie is based on a book which is enough to inspire an entire world of ideals and greatness.
now while, the script was reminiscent of a tv show with a soap-operish tinge every now and then, it made a great modernization. ""the country is in chaos, trains have become the only affordable means of transportation."" beautifully and rationally thought of.

In the year 2016, a group of individualistic industrialists are being targeted by the forces of mediocrity and socialism. It's up to Dagny Taggart and Henry Rearden to save the nation from economic ruin -- and maybe find out who some guy named John Galt is. I found Atlas Shrugged, Part 1 to be a low-budget bore that does little to elucidate Rand's ideas; if you're a fan of the book, however, you may want to give the Blu-ray a shot, as it contains several making-of docs and a commentary track with the filmmakers.",1320710400,19,937,4.583333333333333

Even though this adaptation of the first third of the massive novel has ""TV movie"" written all over it, what's wrong with that?  It appears to me as though virtually every penny of the budget made it up on to the screen, and you can't say that about most major Hollywood  movies.  The limited CGI effects were pretty decent, the score well done and effective, and the use of locations was inspired.

Some reviewers have commented on the ""unfinished"" feeling this movie has.  That's to be expected, since it is only Part 1.  Parts 2 and 3 will be forthcoming, completing Rand's novel.  Having said that, modern film goers have been almost programmed into passively watching a movie as opposed to paying attention to dialogue.  This works against Atlas Shrugged, Part 1.  There is a lot of dialogue, and if you aren't listening carefully, you'll miss some important plot points.  Still, there isn't a wasted word in the piece.  And lines are delivered with skill and conviction.  You'll  have to be patient, though.  If you know the novel, large chunks of dialogue are missing.  If you don't know the novel, you'll be left hanging because many of the set pieces of Part 1 resume in Part 2 and even Part 3.  This is the downfall of any multi-part presentation; you have to come back for the pay offs and resolutions.

There are some well-known character actors in Atlas Shrugged, Part 1; actors whose faces and voices you will recognize but whose names will escape you.  The principles, who were unknown to me, were very good in their interpretations of Rand's characters.  At least, I thought they were.

If you are afraid of Ayn Rand's philosophy for whatever reason, try watching Atlas Shrugged, Part 1 for what it is.  A timely mystery-science fiction-conspiracy thriller movie that will pique your imagination and make you think about the world you're living in.  It's not too far removed the the world of John Galt.",1320710400,8,2062,4.711484593837535

The brevity of the film is my biggest complaint and why I took a star off. When it ended, I was kinda ticked off, to put it mildly. It was just starting to really take off and it ends.

4844500,5,B005N4DMMG,"it's who is going to stop me."" - Ayn Rand

That quote probably embodies the spirit behind the new Atlas Shrugged movie better than anything from the book actually.

The director and producers didn't have a studio, didn't have actors, didn't have a distribution network, didn't have any of the normal resources required to make and distribute a movie.

They did it anyway. And it's good.

Other than Armin Shimerman I didn't recognize a single actor in the movie. And it didn't matter, because they were good. Taylor Schilling does a great job as Dagny; Graham Beckel (he's had bit parts in Castle and Battlestar Galactica) is outstanding as Ellis Wyatt.

The pacing is a touch slow, but it's meant to be an epic, so that expected. The score is outstanding. Frankly Elia Cmiral deserves an Oscar for the score. He won't get it, but he deserves it.

The biggest problem with the movie - it's ""Part 1"" of 3. Much like The Fellowship of the Ring, it feels unfinished. And of course it's a rather depressing film because it is only the first 3rd of the book. The movie ends on the iconic scene of Wyatt Oil's burning fields.

Considering the relatively low budget, ""Atlas Shrugged Part I"" is a great looking movie. The sets are very nice and the ""John Galt Line"" sequences look great. But like the book, the plot moves slowly. General viewers are likely to be bored. Fans of the book will probably like it more, becuase as an adaptation ""Atlas Shrugged Part I"" is surprisingly good, but as a movie and a work on its own it's not that great.

Though the movie is interesting and mildly entertaining if you haven't read the book it is hard to follow why certain things are happening and the motives for the characters are watered down if not completely absent. I understand the need to cut some of the philosophical dialogue in order to create movement but not so much that the major points are turned into small sound bites. Also the movie doesn't capture the ideas of Ayn Rand very well it captures the ideas that the director thought important. There is nothing enforced about sexual freedom, nor does it do a very good job of showing Hank Rearden's wife as being a detestable figure. In the movie she seemed more like a trophy wife when it is much more complicated than that. The most disappointing of all the characters was Francisco d'Anconia his dialogue is almost non  existent he is one of the characters that make the story incredibly interesting.

4844507,5,B005N4DMMG,"I have read most of Ayn Rand's books and I found the stories intriguing.  They are not like any other stories I have read.  They have a tendency to show why being a statist is bad for the individual and the country. It shows what happens when you are in a complete democracy where the people only elect people that use the taxes collected to give them a free ride until there are no more taxpayers.  Remind you of anyone.  I heard through some friends about this movie and I was very excited to see it.  It was only in theaters for a couple of weeks before they pulled it.

Well I was surprised how they wrote the screenplay I don't even remember if they used incredulous like the book does so much, I think it was Ayn Rand's favorite phrase; they followed the story of the first part of the book pretty well. I really like the actress who played Dabney Taggert being intelligent, hard working engineer and the actor who played Hank Reardon who was not intimidated by others and was a self made man.  The things that they were doing in the movie seemed to remind me of some of the things our government is trying to push down our throats.  Now I live in Chicago and as you can imagine that many people would not go see this movie on principle.  I think that people are not seeing it on purpose because they are afraid of what they might find out.  The building of the John Gault line with the Reardon metal and the bridge was pretty cool and I found it exciting.

If the movie is so bad, how come everyone in the theater I was in stood up and clapped after the movie and it was a Chicago theater?

I cannot wait until they release the Blue ray DVD.  I cannot understand the delay with all the other bad movies that come out right away. Why is the industry so afraid of this movie?

Almost always disappointed.  I also doubted anyone could produce a watchable movie out of such heavy and lengthy philosophical content.  I was really surprised to find this flick was not only spellbinding but also a very slick production. It's unusual for me to buy a movie to watch a 2nd time but I'll be slipping it into the blue ray player for another viewing the night it gets here.

But if you don't like Stephen King, you might not like his movies, either, though they are not anywhere near the same genre.

I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" in my teens, way back in the last century and would have considered myself a conservative capitalist back then. I have grown since, but I still can appreciate Rand's work seeing that she grew up in Soviet Russia and lived the harshness of communism.

The movie is done in a very surrealistic-style, which is a style I appreciate and enjoy. Since this is to be three-part series, you do end ""Part 1"" with unanswered questions and the film may seem ""incomplete"" such as when you might have watched the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If you hadn't read either Tolkien or Rand, you might feel ""short-changed."" I personally am hoping that they do finish the whole 3 parts or we might actually be ""short-changed.""

With all of that, the film was an extraordinary movie with a great story line and good acting. As I recall, it also seems to be following the book closely (as far as I can remember from the 20th Century!)

Trying to adapt the book exactly will never happen.  But they have come as close as possible to a very exacting portrayal of the masterpiece.

I am a Christian, so fundamentally I can't agree with Rand on her philosophy as a whole, but she was never given the same treatment for her work that a man would have been given, nor a Liberal.  Because of her belief and fact finding, she was railroaded, mistreated, and pretty much cast-out.  Although, nothing could be closer to fact than her concept of true Capitalism.

4844515,2,B005N4DMMG,"I began reading Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged back in June and five months later I am on page 298, which leaves me with a measly 771 pages. At this rate I should finish the book by mid-2012. This 90-minute film is based on part one of her novel which stretches 312 pages and anyone who has opened the book will realize that each page, top-to-bottom with words and in very small font, has a bit more writing than the average page of a novel. Rand wrote the novel as a thinly-veiled allegory for her philosophy Objectivism, much of which has been embraced by libertarians and conservatives and has seen a recent surge in popularity. With no political or philosophical leanings, which seem to influence many critiques of her literary output, I began reading the novel solely for educational value and am close enough to finishing part 1 that I figured I might as well see the filmed version. Filmmakers have been trying to bring this to the screen for years and the finished product is an independent film made for $6 million with a no-name director and few familiar faces in the cast. With no real marketing budget, the film was heavily promoted by the Tea Party movement and grossed an impressive 1.6 million on only 300 screens it's opening weekend. Expanding to more screens the following week, the box-office numbers took a serious tumble and the film failed to make back its budget. In addition to the financial performance, the film received abysmal reviews with only one of seventeen top critics on Rotten Tomatoes giving it a positive notice. Holding a rotten 12%, one may be surprised to look to the right of the screen and see that 80% of audiences liked it. I immediately questioned the validity of the reviews, wondering if the dislike stemmed from personal feelings about Rand and her work rather than the product itself. I have no solid opinion about her philosophy or her novel, ergo I have no bias. Even so, Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 is quite underwhelming.

The film begins on September 2, 2016 in a dystopian version of the United States that is in a sustained economic depression. A gas shortage has made prices rise to $37.50 per gallon and rail travel is now the only affordable means of transportation. This is good for Taggart Transcontinental CEO James Taggart (Matthew Marsden), except that a major accident on his Rio Norte line threatens the future of his company. His sister Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling), the Vice-President in Charge of Operation, is dissatisfied with her brother's handling of the issue and decides to replace the aging track with rails made by Rearden Metal. The credibility of the metal is the subject of controversy, but inventor Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler) insists that his metal is lighter and stronger than conventional steel. Dagny takes the gamble and the remainder of the film consists of nearly everyone, seen and unseen, trying to keep Rearden Metal from being used. Meanwhile, during many conversations that occur throughout the film, characters repeat the phrase ""Who is John Galt?"" A man, who is safely assumed to be John Galt, appears several times draped in shadow. People of merit have been mysteriously vanishing and the film makes it clear that they mysteriously vanish after speaking briefly with this shadowy figure. This way of incorporating the character could have made the film more ominous and mysterious but unfortunately just comes off as cheesy.

The mediocrity of the production can be attributed to budget restraints, but the filmmakers must take responsibility for how they presented the material with limited means. With a six million dollar budget it's not ultra-cheap and classier films have been made with less. The truth of the matter is that those responsible for this film may have been too inexperienced for such an ambitious project. The musical score by Elia Cmiral and how it's used is the most irritating thing about Atlas Shrugged. The music itself may be fine, but rarely has a score been used so poorly that is actually cheapens the overall film. The score is so overbearing and overwrought, used needlessly in every establishing shot and nearly every scene, only getting worse as the film progresses. It's irritating at the beginning and grows to be inappropriate. Like someone performing stand-up comedy at a funeral, it just doesn't fit. I am unable to comment on his ability as a composer and I don't want to be the guy that slams him for his past work, but it's worth nothing that Cmiral has previously scored Wrong Turn, Battlefield Earth, and The Lost Boys: The Thirst. If he publicly admits to sabotaging the film, I would not bat an eyelash. For part 2 to be a success, either Cmiral or whoever responsible for displacing the score throughout the film needs to be fired.

The cast consists of unknown actors and at least four character actors whose faces are more easily recognized than their names. These four; Michael Lerner, Jon Polito, Patrick Fischler, and Garham Beckel fare much better than those around them. The unknown actors that make up the principle cast all seem to have backgrounds in television, which may be to blame for their stiff, lifeless performances. Ironically, Matthew Marsden gives the stiffest performance and he actually has some film work behind him. Schilling makes a convincing Dagny, intelligent and beautiful without being too sexy. When it comes to the cold, calculating nature of the character she falters and her attempts to sell this attitude seem forced. Worse, some of the acting is straight from evening television with actors delivering their lines without thought or feeling, as if they're just reading them directly off the page.

Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 feels like a made-for-TV movie, the Hallmark version of Rand's novel, complete with a sex scene that appears to be directly lifted from a Lifetime original movie. While it's not glaringly bad, it is thoroughly mediocre. It's not incompetent, just very amateurish and guilty of an obvious desire to look more refined than it can afford. It even has that faux-polished look typically reserved for television dramas. It's not that it too closely resembles a TV-movie, it's that it too closely resembles the worst of TV movies. The material is just presented in such a silly manner, with the camera angles, the music, the choppy editing, and the acting style all evoking sub-par material found on nighttime cable. It came as no surprise to me that director Paul Johansson's previous directorial credits include directing episodes of the television show One Tree Hill. In another shocking twist, the cinematographer Ross Berryman previously shot 28 episodes of Ugly Betty and 66 episodes of Angel. Even the lead actors Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler immediately followed roles on television with this. Even when the film presents beautifully scenic images, they just seem superficial and generic, like framed pictures of blue skies and green trees you'd find hanging on the walls of a dental office.

Putting aside any thoughts you have on Ayn Rand and her work, it's inarguable that Atlas Shrugged is an important piece of literature. This makes this adaptation even more frustrating, as it completely fails to capture the appropriate tone for an important philosophical novel of this stature. Some people consider Atlas Shrugged a ludicrous joke and the filmmakers almost seem to treat the material as such. Significant sections of the film play like a pretentious parody of the material and, even worse, it seems blissfully unaware of this. The heavy-handed has been rendered into a ham-handed film. The abrupt ending is especially laughable and it's inconceivable that they couldn't have made the transition between this and the next installment a bit smoother.

The film doesn't stray too far from Rand's text with everything essential remaining and only minor characters and minor scenes omitted. It moves by quickly, a remarkable feat when one considers that the first part of the novel consists of boardroom meetings, train rides, more meetings, characters thinking about meetings, and endless discussions about Rearden Metal. Rand wrote in a very detailed, elaborate way and the fact that the filmmakers have seamlessly condensed this section of her opus into a 90-minute film that never feels dull is an achievement in and of itself. While it's hard to believe this film had a budget in the millions, there are moments that are impressive considering what little money the filmmakers had to work with. Some of the architectural aspects alone had to be daunting for such an independent production. Unfortunately, a larger budget and a more experienced crew would have done wonders for this film. A big studio would never fund this project though and it's doubtful that better marketing would make it a box-office hit, so this is probably the only adaptation we're likely to see.

Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 is intriguing at best and embarrassing at worst. Those familiar with Rand will find her story present beneath the amateurish filmmaking, but how they'll respond to it I cannot say. I'd imagine that those drawn to see it will be readers of the novel who want to see this interpretation of the text and those interested in the novel but too lazy to read it. If you're reading this, you'll likely have already made a decision about whether to watch it. Some have loved it, some have hated it, and I fall somewhere in the middle, so do what you will. I am open to seeing the second and third installments, which the producers say will have a higher production budget. Hopefully the filmmaking team will learn from their mistakes and figure out how to properly use it.

When congress passes a no wage increase bill and tries to make it illegal to own more then one company there are deals to be made. Anyone who attempts to challenge the big companies ends up disappearing and the mystery begins. This is a perfect movie for the times we are in. Dealing with the wide gap between the have and have-nots and what companies will do in order to make money. While I have never read the book this movie makes me interested to see how much updating they did to make this movie. Being the first in a series I was expecting more of an introduction then anything else. This was the type of opener that ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" was. A movie that gets you so excited that you can't wait for the others. I will say that the movie started off and within the first minute you are totally sucked in. As the movie went on it began to drag a little, but the end grabbed you again and you are disappointed that it ended. Overall, A very good movie that is helped by the fact that it came out at this time. I give it an A-.

4844517,2,B005N4DMMG,"""Atlas Shrugged"" meets script doctors
Hollywood has people with a curious profession called script doctors, namely, experienced screenwriters who have mastered the craft and get called in to study and improve promising but flawed screenplays for movies and TV shows. I've heard of analogous experts who call themselves novel doctors.

Reportedly the people who gave us the first segment of the widely panned Atlas Shrugged film adaptation (which I haven't seen) have decided to convert the rest of Ayn Rand's novel to film. Given the ideological nature of the project, I can just imagine how badly it will turn out if they stick too closely to the novel. I can also imagine what a regular script doctor might say to these individuals in response to the following aspects of the novel:

First of all, if you set the movie in our immediate future, you can't have Galt's Gulch mysteriously hidden in the Rocky Mountains, like a Republican version of Shangri-La, when millions of Americans visit the Rockies every year and the audience knows about Google Earth, satellite photos, GPS, air traffic control networks, tracking of cell phone calls and so forth, even if the hero John Galt kludges together an invisibility screen over the valley.

Secondly, if you play the Galt/Dagny aspect of the plot straight, Galt's stalking-like behavior will remind them of unsub characters who threaten innocent women in police shows like Criminal Minds. Viewers might also pick up on Galt's implied adult virginity, especially if they've read the novel, and laugh at the character's expense. You have to downplay those aspects of the story somehow.

Thirdly, you just can't have Dagny Taggart's sister-in-law, Cheryl Taggart, commit suicide after Dagny makes an emotional connection with her, and yet have Dagny go on with her business as she does in the rest of the novel like nothing out of the ordinary happened. Dagny in a film version should show grief because of Cheryl's suicide, and also anger at her brother Jim because of his shabby treatment of Cheryl. (Given that anomaly in the novel, I've wondered if Rand inserted the part about Cheryl's suicide just to get rid of a character she couldn't figure out how to use, without working through all the consequences in the plot.)

And fourth, you'll have to play the latter half of the film adaptation like a zombie apocalypse or a Mad Max movie. You just can't have the heroes hang out in Galt's Gulch for a few months while America experiences a massive Malthusian collapse, and then show them going back to work and rebuilding an industrial society, again like nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Too much of the support structure for a modern economy will have fallen to ruins by then, and America's cities will look like Life After People.

I can think of some other objections a script doctor might make, like the part in the hobo Jeff Allen's story about the mean, ugly 8-year-old girl who got braces under the 20th Century Motor Company's new employee benefits plan, and how a disgruntled auto worker struck her and knocked out all her teeth. Would you really want to show that on film to demonstrate the depravity caused by health insurance? Passages like that in Rand's novels support the impression that she really didn't like children.

No, to me a proper film adaptation of Atlas Shrugged would have to try to capture the novel's weirdness. In my imagination it would look something like Sky Captain, and it would need cgi work in post-production to represent Rand's literary prosopagnosia. Rand describes the heroes' faces almost like geometric objects, and the villains' faces like a gooey, disgusting chaos. So the post work would have to modify the villains' faces, at least, to push them into the uncanny valley and elicit the sort of revulsion Rand wanted the readers of her novel to feel towards them.

But, of course, nobody listens to me, so the Atlas Shrugged film project will just turn into a different sort of disaster.",1319760000,9,3991,4.910979228486647
4844518,5,B005N4DMMG,"Being a big fan of Ayn Rand's great novel Atlas Shrugged, I expect a less-than-stellar movie version of the book. Happily, I was very pleased with the first installment of the film.

With the length and scope of the story, it requires either an incredibly long movie or a division into different parts, which they decided to do here. While I've heard plenty about the overall low budget of the film, it is still very well done and they spent some good money on CGI effects for the John Galt Line. Taylor Schilling is actually very good as Dagny Taggart - she projects the high-end efficiency and passion of the character, and she is appropriately sexy as well. Grant Bowler as Hank Reardon turns out to be a decent choice as well.

Bottom line, though: I brought along my 16-year-old daughter to see the film, and I expected her to find it ""boring"" or otherwise uninteresting. Big surprise, though: she loved it! She likes the story and was very drawn to the character of Dagny Taggart. Dagny is such an inspirational role model for women, and I'm glad to see my daughter was inspired as well.",1319414400,581,1093,4.571428571428571

This is an adaptation of Ayn Rand's masterpiece, in which her ""Objectivist"" philosophy (rational selfishness) is laid out in detail. It is philosophical in nature, but not of the anti-American type we're used to from Hollywood. Those of the political left will generally not like the themes of personal responsibilty, personal accountability, money as a positive driving force, personal property rights and the absolute loathing of socialism, unions, and crony capitalism. These themes are present in the film, though subdued somewhat. If you don't like Mrs. Rand's books, you will not like this film.

Perhaps on Atlas II. The real jewel that has not been talked about is a weekly one hour tv series allowing for the full depth of character development and the story told in its entirety. The series would necessarily run for several years and in my opinion would be a blockbuster hit that the entire nation would become addicted to. It would not be a gamble but a sure thing.",1319068800,8,537,4.2745098039215685

The movie did a great job communicating the basic concepts of the book to my wife and children which lead to very entertaining discussions afterwards.

It's difficult to do justice to a legendary 50+ year old 1100+ page book. Very wise to split it into three parts to pack as much in as possible, but even then it's hard to capture the whole book on screen.

Amazing to see the book at #7 on Amazon's list after all these years!

Fantastic to have it available on DVD/Blu-Ray soon, as the theater release wasn't very widespread, with zero advertising.

But this should be perfect at home on a big screen. (133"" projection system here!)

Can't wait to get a copy for my sister, my nieces, etc!!!

The cinematography was fantastic, especially for a film made on a very low budget compared to most Hollywood flicks.

I hope they make enough from the DVD/Blu-Ray/Product sales to get parts 2 and 3 finished up!

But, I am so glad that it is soon to be out and I really hope that Part II is at the very least direct-to-vid.  I read this and The Fountain Head, along with Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations as required reading in college.  Obviously, back when one really, really was taught something other than conversations with body parts.  All three helped form my understanding about how wealth works in an economy where the Gov'mint does what's it's supposed to do:  Protect Us.  It also showed how the poor, charities and communities were destroyed by Federal Government.  It took from the citizens to spend how ""they"" wanted!  Look at us today, we want to ""Occupy Something and Tax the Rich!""  We DO tax the Rich, we just do NOT like how gov'mint spends it and our poor, knuckle-head kids don't even understand that.

The movie is well made - the quality is actually quite good. Acting was generally good to excellent. Camera work was good; although the low budget resulted in a missing camera angle here and there. Special effects were consistently well done.

The story, of course, is exceptional; and it is well-told in this movie.

Numbers I've seen indicate 80% of the audience (more than 12,000 people were polled) give this movie a thumbs up.  And yet, only about 13% of professional movie critics gave this a thumbs up.  By voting it down, the professional movie critics really got it wrong. Why? I don't know . . . I am truly surprised that so many movie critics would allow their own political bias to influence their review - but I can find no objective reason for the critics' poor grades.

Some people would say that those of the liberal persuasion would not enjoy this; as the message is counter to the socialist perspective. But regardless of the message, we are today living in the world of Atlas Shrugged; and thus, I urge you to watch this movie.  If you are to open your mind to new and different ideas, then this is certainly a movie that will challenge you.

A few important lines and at least one important speech by Francisco were omitted.  Including these would not have slowed the movie down; they would have enhanced the movie.  Toward the end, Dagny tells Francisco she's going to name her new railroad the John Galt Line, and says ""Let them come claim it.""  What was inexplicably omitted was Fransisco's two-word retort:  ""He will.""  Wouldn't that line pique the interest of someone who never read the book?  Also, Dr. Stadler's (sp?), who was clearly of German descent in the book, was portrayed by an Asian.  Finally, Professor Hugh Akston appeared to be more of a hillbilly than as a master chef and mentor to 3 of the main heroes in the book.

4844529,2,B005N4DMMG,"I'm a capitalist and an Ayn Rand fan. But there's a reality out there that many do not want to accept: certain novels just don't work and can't work on the big screen. This is not the first Ayn Rand novel to be made into a movie.  The first one was ""The Fountainhead.""  The hero of that novel gives a speech which reads:

  ""Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light.

  ""Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He was probably torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build. He was considered a transgressor who ventured into forbidden terrritory. But thereafter, men could travel past any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had opened the roads of the world.""

And it goes on like that for many more paragraphs.

It makes for powerful prose in a novel.  Delivered by a character onscreen, it's sounds and looks ridiculous.  I'm sorry, it just does.

Atlas Shrugged shrugged encounters then same problem.

A typical exchange in the film goes like this:

MYSTERIOUS STRANGER: ""Midas Mulligan?""

MM: ""Who are you?""

STRANGER: ""Someone who works for himself and not let others feed off the profits of his energy.""

Once again, riveting prose in a novel, ludicrous dialog onscreen.

Simply put, Atlas Shrugged the novel is more of a philosophy handbook than a novel. Turning such a tome into a screenplay is a near-impossible task.  Powerful ideas can't be easily condensed into sound bytes, and no one should try.

But the other problem with the film is that it takes place in the 21st century, whereas the novel was written in the 1950s. Railroads were a great innovation back then maybe. This is the age of the passenger jet, the iphone, and the electric car. A movie about railroad companies is by itself a dated concept.

Of course, it will be lambasted by those who believe that government is the solution to the problem (e.g., almost all of Hollywood).  Ignore the critics, please; they have an ulterior motive.  As far as I am concerned, and I love films, the acting was excellent (the actors playing the ""good guys"" Dagny, Hank, Francisco and Ellis were as I imagined they should be and the ""bad guys"" were well acted, too).  The movie had a brisk enough pace to stay true to the book and stay interesting.  I saw the movie on the big screen, ordered 2 copies of the DVD and I can't wait to see Part II.

I smiled throughout the movie and left the movie with that smile.  After watching the movie I finished reading the novel that I had previously started.

I do however have one chief complaint and that is that the movie was too short and did not cover some major topics that the book did.  One glaring oversight is that the movie does not have any coverage of the relationship between Eddie, Dagny, and Francisco and how they were childhood friends.  In more depth the movie only briefly hints at the teenage romantic relationship between Dagny and Francisco.  In addition there is no mention of Dr. Robert Stadler in the movie even though Hugh Akston is portrayed.

I hope that this glaring oversight is corrected in the second part and more depth is added to the movie.  Don't get me wrong, the first part was great.  But I feel it could have been even better with the extra depth of the character relationships to each other.",1317859200,66,1053,4.553191489361702

Generally, a television actor who has just recently expanded into films in non-leading roles. Expect more from him. Schilling is just not capable of being a leading actress at this stage in her career, which is highlighted by dating Zac Efron. Her stodgy acting is more in-line with a cheap B-Movie actress. The script is poorly written and the contexts are often lost on the viewer. There was no editing whatsoever with amateurish long shots to just eat up reel time. The expansive boardroom presentations time and time again turn the movie into a poor version of ""12 Angry Capitalists."" Like Joyce's ""Ulysses"" or numerous other classics not made into movies because it does not translate from the written word onto film. The egotistical owner of the movie's rights doomed this movie from te start. Rand never wanted the novel made into a book for all the above reasons. She took the idiot's money because Rand was always a shill went it came to making a free dollar. Read the book, which is bit turgid and philosophically oppressive, in parts, rather than the movie which adds nothing to the intrepretation of Rand's ideas while making it entertaining and educational at the same time. Rand's other book ""Fountainhead"" which was made into a movie was entertaining but not a real understanding of Rand's beliefs but a much better film with great polished actors.

4844537,5,B005N4DMMG,"""Atlas Shrugged"" has been called one of the most influential books of the 20th Century, but was long considered an impossible story to film.  In a story almost as gripping as the book itself, a committed and dauntless team fought for years to bring Ayn Rand's timeless characters to the screen, and this satisfying production is the result.

Rand's monumental book was published as a three-part story; the current film brings Part One to life; Part Two is already underway for a planned 2012 release, with Part Three to follow a year later.  Part One stands up well on its own, though of course like other multipart films (such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"") the first part also sets the stage for much larger stories.  Further, as with Tolkien's or J.K. Rowling's epics, translation to film can never exactly match every reader's imagination; those who have read ""Atlas Shrugged"" will undoubtedly find characters, settings or situations in the film presented differently than they'd seen them in their mind's eye.  Nevertheless, the film does not stray from Rand's underlying story.  Because of this, it is not necessary to read the book prior to seeing the film, though after the film you'll almost certainly want to read the book.

Most of the actors in ""Atlas Shrugged, Part One"", though skilled and believable, will be unfamiliar to moviegoers, but in many ways this is a benefit as it makes the parts they play seem more natural, free from the idiosyncrasies and typecasting with which we often subconsciously bind well-known actors.

The production of ""Atlas Shrugged, Part One"" was fought at every turn by those who fear its message of individual freedom through personal responsibility; like Reardon Metal, what emerged from the fire is a thing of rare worth.

4844540,5,B005N4DMMG,"I have read most of Ayn Rand's books and I found the stories intriguing.  They are not like any other stories I have read.  They have a tendency to show why being a statist is bad for the individual and the country. It shows what happens when you are in a complete democracy where the people only elect people that use the taxes collected to give them a free ride until there are no more taxpayers.  Remind you of anyone.  I heard through some friends about this movie and I was very excited to see it.  It was only in theaters for a couple of weeks before they pulled it.

Well I was surprised how they wrote the screenplay I don't even remember if they used incredulous like the book does so much, I think it was Ayn Rand's favorite phrase; they followed the story of the first part of the book pretty well. I really like the actress who played Dabney Taggert being intelligent, hard working engineer and the actor who played Hank Reardon who was not intimidated by others and was a self made man.  The things that they were doing in the movie seemed to remind me of some of the things our government is trying to push down our throats.  Now I live in Chicago and as you can imagine that many people would not go see this movie on principle.  I think that people are not seeing it on purpose because they are afraid of what they might find out.  The building of the John Gault line with the Reardon metal and the bridge was pretty cool and I found it exciting.

If the movie is so bad, how come everyone in the theater I was in stood up and clapped after the movie and it was a Chicago theater?

I cannot wait until they release the Blue ray DVD.  I cannot understand the delay with all the other bad movies that come out right away. Why is the industry so afraid of this movie? It is like it is Citizen Kane and Hollywood is playing the William Randolph Hearst part of trying to kill it. I hope that parts two and three come out soon.",1315353600,4,1937,4.188679245283019
4844541,3,B005N4DMMG,"I was unimpressed by the script and direction of this movie adaptation.  Dagny was flat, Hank was too happy, and Francisco just wasn't Francisco.  The plot made no sense on some points, e.g. Ellis Wyatt quits the morning after the first run of the JG Line, then returns to set fire to his wells weeks later.  The romance between Hank and Dagny was devoid of conflict or drama of any kind, even about Hank committing adultery.  The final voice-over gave away most of the mystery of Part 2.

Mostly though, the movie was just plain boring in comparison to the book.  The script writer must have gone through Part 1 of the novel, picking out and condensing the major events without regard for the need to create a compelling story.  As a result, the movie is somewhat faithful to the book on the surface, but the major drama of Part 1 -- around the creation and destruction of the John Galt Line -- is absent.

Still... it could have been worse!  Jim Taggart could have been the hero!

And let's remember that Any worked her ovaries off to get Atlas Shrugged published in the first place.  Because she believed in the message she had to tell a somnambulant and lethargic world.

She got a lot of it wrong.  For example, she didn't quite do for Aristotle what your friend and mine, St. Thomas Aqinas could.  She died in self-imposed misery because she couldn't face life the way her own fictional creation, John Galt, could.  And reading her novel, Atlas Shrugged, when I was a lonely, depressed teen-ager, mad at the world for taking away his father at the age of 14, landed me with a psychotic breakdown and a short tenure at a loony-bin instead of completing the second semester of my senior year in high school.

But it wasn't entirely Ayn's fault that she didn't believe in God.  One might have thought that just to non-conform to Comrade Stalin's protocols, she might have given it a try.

Here is what bothers me about my fellow reviewers, both pro and con:  yes, Ayn's message is very relevant today, given our sorry economic climate.  As the ""Demotivators"" poster will gladly tell you friends, when you're part of the problem, there's good money to be made selling the solution.

Alan Greenspan (remember him, boys and girls)? was one of Ayn's proudest proteges.  If you don't believe me, go check out a wonderful PBS ""Frontline"" Documentary, called ""The Warning"", (from October 20, 2009), which deconstructs the economic meltdown we all went through a scant three years ago, and its roots.  Atlas, you see, has already shrugged.  And Ayn's protege, Mr. Greenspan, and his fellow horsemen of the Unregulated Free Market Lazzez Faire Internet Bubble Home Refinancing Apocalypse, helped him do it.

For those of us who don't quite have the attention span to deal with over-the-counter derivatives or long novels, all of this rhetoric makes absolutely GREAT entertainment.  But guess what?  Where do you think Galt's Gulch is, IN REALITY?  It's as close (or as far away) as the time clock you slide your ID badge through, at your place of employment.  We are all John Galt, whether we like it or not.

Here is one question that Ayn got absolutely RIGHT, and that I, a cradle Catholic (certainly not one of Ms. Rand's favorite demographics, I'm confident), would have no trouble whatsoever asking to, say, Pope Benedict XVI:  ""What is the root of all MONEY?""  If you prefer taking  Pink Floyd's version of ""Money"" as gospel, call me an UberConservative, spit in my face, don't bother either reading the book or seeing the movie, and write your own damn 1-star review.  The Europeans, the Arabs and the Chinese will all still laugh all the way to the bank.

The cigarette, Ayn, should not have had the monogram of a dollar sign.  It should have been that of a Euro, or maybe a Yuan ...  but how could you have known?",1313193600,5,3459,4.715

4844546,5,B005N4DMMG,"First of all, I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" a couple of years ago, and while long, it's very, very relevant to those open to seeing its message and how it relates to us now. Halfway through reading it, I kept saying to myself, ""This is happening right now."" It really is, too. When I found out about the film, I was thrilled--but surprised to find out that it would be a trilogy. It's true to the book, but it's not EXACTLY like the book, there are some modernizations--like Dagny's assistant wearing a Bluetooth.

I thought the acting was pretty good, and the film very well done, in addition to being an incredible story to begin with. I wasn't expecting something as well produced as this film, and was surprised at how well it was made. The script moves fast, and makes its point. I can't remember any part of it that was ""slow.""

Author Ayn Rand came from the USSR, and wrote this and The Fountainhead based on her experiences before she left. If you're not familiar with her history and philosophy, read it before you comment, please--I mean, really, it's the least you could do before putting fourth your contempt for either the book, film or author.

Don't let the nasty comments deter you from seeing this film, since they were obviously written by those who troll on Amazon and other outlets for the sole purpose of slamming anything remotely conservative.  I would also theorize that there is ADD involved, and they don't have an attention span long enough to watch a 2 hour film or read a 1200 page book. If you don't believe me, check out the commentary on Laura Ingraham's new book, ""Of Thee I Zing."" Yes, I've read that one too.",1312848000,8,1637,4.538983050847458

The screenplay is even worse, the production values are poor. The acting fails, and worst of all, the director has no business making movies. Read Roger Ebert's review if you don't believe me. Speaking of ""no business,"" that's just what it did in theaters. No one went to see it. Not even the hoardes of idiot Tea Party loons to whom, if they can read, the poisonous trash vomited onto paper by Ayn Rand is their Bible. It lost every cent spent to make it (The market has spoken, as Rand would herself would say), so fortunately, the other two movies planned to be made from this literary refuse will never be made. If you want to see a really peculiar, unbalanced, and disturbed bit of movie-making, check this one out. It's the PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE of right-wing nutjob propaganda movies.

4844552,5,B005N4DMMG,"I've read Atlas Shrugged a couple times over the last 20 years since I was introduced to Objectivism.  I've always thought the Atlas Shrugged should be a mini-series.  With that in mind the movie was very well done although some history between the characters was left out.  I wasn't sure my 9 year old daughter and Marxist girl friend would understand it.

My daughter loved, and understood it which inspired a lengthy discussion over dinner after the movie.

My Marxist girl friend also loved it and asked, ""Who is John Galt?""  I told her to read the book if she wanted to know before part III came out.  So I bought her a copy after dinner and she hasn't finished it yet.  Interestingly,  she didn't understand what the villians were doing that was so wrong while watching the movie.  She is now reading part III in the book and is understaning what the villians are doing wrong, according to Objectivism.

4844554,5,B005N4DMMG,"ATLAS SHRUGGED, apart from its political viewpoint (which Hollywood hates!), is a tough, tough project to adapt as a screenplay, with multiple characters and storylines and a philosophy that must be articulated in order to explain the plot. As a screenwriter, I've thought for years about how to adapt it -- and always wanted the chance. I would read that this company or that company had the rights, but it never got made. Then a small, committed production company funded on a shoestring did this remarkable adaptation.

My admiration for the movie is on many levels -- but as I watched it (on its opening night in a standing room only screening), all I could think was: They got it right. This is such a difficult book to turn into film, and yet they caught all the important nuances, put in all the important characters, and did it in a way that is so wonderfully cinematic ...

I couldn't believe it was so good!

I saw the film three times in the theaters (fortunately for me, the only theater it played in the area happened to be my neighborhood theater, so it was easy to get to). The first night, there were no seats left for the 7 pm showing. By the last night of the engagement three weeks later, I was the only one in the theater.

It was still terrific. I bought the soundtrack CD and have played it many times, and can't wait for the DVD. The actors fit their roles perfectly -- not an easy task, when you consider how well known and loved these characters are, and for over 50 years. Everyone has an idea of who they are and how they should be played -- but I didn't find fault with a single actor, and I thought Grant Bowles, in particular, could not have been more perfect as Hank Reardon.

It's also remarkable that Rand's characters did not somehow morph into stock Hollywood caricatures (it would have been so easy to make that happen) -- they remained very much who they were, and this story about big business that played out in boardrooms and quiet conferences became riveting to watch.

Bravo to the film company -- can't wait for this DVD -- can't wait even more for the second installment of ATLAS SHRUGGED, which has been announced as opening in the fall of 2012.

And I can't help thinking that the movie poster should have included a few words: ""NOW MORE THAN EVER ... """,1309046400,10,2299,4.446555819477434
4844555,5,B005N4DMMG,"The current administration and the NLRB thugs and other heavy handed government departments are making this 54 year old story a reality. It is incredibly foretelling. This government is destroying the US as it was envisioned and making it into another euro-failure, mediocre place. People now think anything they ""want"" or ""need"" is somehow a ""right"" to be provided at others' expense and labor. Even non-residents and illegal aliens. I think it is too late, and Atlas is shrugging. Enoyed this movie so much I am finally reading the book==which is even more scary and on the mark. People who are in denial over the content of the movie/book, are not educated in history or politics--and probably only educated by the media and the publis schools. We hope this movie goes forward, but seriously doubt it can do so at this late time in the actual unfolding of the telling.",1309046400,6,871,4.8133333333333335
4844556,5,B005N4DMMG,"I only fairly recently read Atlas Shrugged, I just wasn't exposed to it, or found the time to dive in.  But I heard the chatter about the movie project so I read it for the first time -- within the last 12 months, actually.

I am a disciple, a true believer...I always found myself in alignment with John Galt, but just never had anything to relate my own philosophies to.  I've read Milton Friedman in high school for class.  I was a young Reaganite in 1980-1, wearing the campaign buttons to school, almost to the point of fanaticism.  I have never wavered in that believe that man is responsible for himself and must not be condemned to live in slavery to another, even if those bonds are ""virtual"" or economic.

So I read the book.  The parallels it draws to modern day is chilling.  Many of the things which occurred in the book/movie are those things which I've heard our National Socialists in Washington chime in on, but with a different name.  State control of the sciences, State regulation of railroad traffic, institutionalizing ""fairness"" at the expense of freedom.  Special taxes to confiscate wealth from the better off regions (does Obama's punishment of Texas somehow equate to Wesley Mouch's punishment of Colorado?  The loathing is plainly obvious.) disdain for oil production,  shipping our resources and money to other ""People's Republics"" at the expense of our own economy and citizenry.

I was expecting a wide variation in content between book and movie, but was pleasantly surprised how closely some of the scenes followed.  I can't wait until part II when many of the confrontations take place between the main characters, it will be riveting.

Come on....get the disc pressing done and let's get it in our hands!  We can loan it out to our friends, invite neighbors over who just simply listed to the reviews and negative hype and assumed it was a very bad movie.",1308960000,4,1890,4.769230769230769
4844557,5,B005N4DMMG,"My wife and I both found the movie to be entertaining and involving; I believe that's significant because she is not really a fan of Ayn Rand and I am. When Ayn Rand was alive I subscribed to her ""Objectivist Newsletter"" and found the articles of interest and have read many of her books including most of her non-fiction works.

I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" for the first time in 1971 and found it fascinating but not threatening; I have almost completed the book again and confess that the similarities to life in the United States today have become too much of a mirror to the events and attitudes found in the book. In that regard the book becomes more sinister in that it reflects to too great an extent the growing socialist attitudes found in this country at this time.

I will try and limit my observations to the movie as a representation of what Ayn Rand presents in Part 1 of the book. My impression is the screenplay by John Aglialoro and Brian Patrick O'Toole has captured much of the essence of Part 1 in a rather neatly done condensation. Obviously much has been skipped but it seems to me enough of the message of Part 1 has been captured to make the movie version very worthwhile.

Taylor Schilling does an excellent job in her role as Dagny Taggert as does Grant Bowler as Henry Rearden. I didn't have any problems with any of the other casting and felt the selected actors did a good job.

Although my wife is not really familiar with Ayn Rand's ""objectivist philosophy"" she was able to enjoy the movie for what it presented as a movie; I do not feel it necessary that one be a fan of the philosophy to enjoy the movie.

I am a fiscal conservative and can see how those with a liberal/progressive mindset could take offense at the movie. I've signed up to be notified when the movie is available for sale and will order the Blu-ray version as soon as it's available.

The Atlas Shrugged Part 2 website is being set up and suggests Part 2 will be released to theaters in the fall of 2012. I for one hope this happens; I've signed up to get email updates from this website.

So as an admirer of Atlas Shrugged, the book, I was cautiously optimistic about Atlas Shrugged Part One.  My optimism was only bolstered by the fact that the movie was made independently and without any big name Hollywood stars.

To be fair, a lot about Atlas Shrugged Part One was done right.  The actors were well cast, particularly Grant Bowler as Rearden.  The atmosphere was pitch-perfect as the future dystopia.  What damaged the film were the narrative choices made by director Paul Johansson.  The script dragged, even for a viewer with as much patience and familiarity with the story as me.

SPOILER:
Worst of all, Johansson completely erodes the initial mystery that drives the story- Who is John Galt?  He answers the immortal question in the opening frame of the movie.  This is part 1, in the book Galt doesn't appear on stage until part 3.  Here we know from the very first scene that it is Galt persuading businessmen to quit and vanish.

Atlas Shrugged is a dangerous movie. It exposes and subverts the dominant struggle of recorded history, which is the war of the Takers against the Makers.

Most people won't get Atlas Shrugged because we have been programmed to see the world the way the Takers want us to see it; therefore, you're supposed to hate this movie, but see it anyway and let the healing begin. If you weren't choking back tears when they crossed the bridge, then your soul is definitely sick.

The technique is perfect. It makes hundreds of points by simply letting us watch the lives of the characters, and the characters don't bore us with pedantic words like ""capitalism"" or ""socialism"". I don't even recall them using the word ""government"" - how refreshing.

The main point is how those who simply pursue their own self interest with honesty, boldness, and confidence help the world immensely; whereas, those socialists and crony capitalists who claim they want to help the world by forcing others to provide that help are causing the world more harm than good.

The casting was superlative. The score, dialogue, and filming were all wonderfully done.

It was interesting that living in the DC area, only a very small number of theaters actually showed this movie, and it was only in them for a short period of time. Knowing the topic of the book, and seeing how the critics and Hollywood hated to see this book made into a movie, I wasn't surprised. I was however, surprised at the turn outs - at least for the showings I attended.

Much as I felt when first reading Ayn Rand's book so long ago in college, I was not surprised that the critics panned the movie. The almost prophetic nature of Ms Rand's novel when compared to what is occurring daily in the world is more than a little unnerving, and the fact that this movie is set in the near future is shear genius on the part of the studio to really drive home just how similar what we see today, mimics the underlying tone of the book in so many ways.

For being a completely independently funded small budget movie, the cinematography and casting were spot on!  The sweeping landscapes during the train scenes were just breathtaking and the bridge was stunning. Dagny could not have been played by a better actress in my eyes.

4844571,5,B005N4DMMG,"Trying to make a movie about one of the most famous and beloved novels of the 20th century is a daunting task. The critics that do not care for Ayn Rand or her philosophy are going to give a biased (i.e. negative) opinion of the film regardless of how well it was made. The fans of Ayn Rand will find the film stays pretty true to the book. The actors chosen were perfect for their roles.

The are only two criticisms I have for the movie. One is that it if you haven't read the book or at least know the basics about the book, some people might be a little lost. The other criticism relates to the first. In the book there are lengthy conversations about different topics. These conversation are brief and summarized in the movie. Perhaps it was done so the movie doesn't drag on.

The book is over 1000 pages long and therefore the movie is going to be made in 3 parts. Part 1 was great and leaves you yearning for more. I can't wait for Part 2.",1306368000,14,947,4.169398907103825
4844572,5,B005N4DMMG,"All the nasty, liberal critics who have panned Atlas Shrugged Part 1 should be ashamed!!  They won't be, but they should!  I've seen this movie twice, and it was even better the second time around.  Hope and pray that they will still make parts 2 and 3, as part 1 was a very good film!!!",1306195200,14,287,4.181818181818182
4844573,4,B005N4DMMG,"I think you need to read Ayn Rand's book ""Atlas Shrugged"" in advance of seeing this movie; I'm not sure that you can get the full message by seeing the movie alone.

The theme of the plot can be revealed without spoiling it:  Atlas Shrugged pits individuals against huge central invasive government in order to illustrate the smothering effect of government control, and the moral violence that is inherent in compulsive rule over the individuals being governed.

This movie is absolutely beautifully shot, and the casting is brilliant.  The idea to take the story out of its original setting in the early 20th century and place it in the year 2016 was pure genius.

But I do think some of the book's messages were a little cloudy in the movie, although things may become clearer in the sequels.  I'm not sure that the viewer will be clear on the relationship between the suffering throughout the nation and the cause factors of morally bankrupt public economic policy.  Nor will they necessarily understand how dedicated people trying to run key industries in the face of stultifying regulation are providing the only ray of hope.  These things are suggested in the movie; they are driven home in the book.

So:  read the book AND see the movie!",1306195200,12,1246,4.780373831775701
4844574,5,B005N4DMMG,I saw this movie the first weekend it came out and was thrilled!  Its suprising how much Hollywood tried to shut this movie down when they are the ones who suppose to love free speech so much.  But you cant stop the signal so cant wait for the DVD to start my Trilogy collection!,1306108800,10,279,4.148148148148148
4844575,5,B005N4DMMG,"I read the book for the first time over 20 years ago. I've been waiting for a movie ever since.

I was not disappointed.

What more can a person ask for.

No movie of a book that long could ever do justice to the book, but this movie grabs the essence and message of the story. It is wonderful and I can't wait for Parts 2 and 3!",1305849600,38,329,3.8088235294117645
4844576,5,B005N4DMMG,"I saw this movie in the theater (1st time in years I went to the theater instead of waiting for the Blu Ray version to be released). I have to admit I was in awe of how the screenwriter(s) kept the movie length within the attention span of the normal person, yet still followed the book, and kept the story understandable. I was, to say the least, impressed with Taylor Schilling, Grant Bowler, and the rest of the cast members. They delivered, as only trained professionals can. I hope we don't have long to wait for the Blu Ray. I want to introduce this film, and the acting talent behind it, to my friends. It's a shame it got blacklisted by the Hollywood crowd, but that should tell everyone all they need to know. If it wasn't a well created, to the point movie project, Hollywood would have let it fall on its own sword. Instead, it's feared. It's a shame, but it will find its success in video, because that market is truly free, and we the consumer get to vote with our money, and time, which will be well spent.",1305417600,43,1020,4.317708333333333
