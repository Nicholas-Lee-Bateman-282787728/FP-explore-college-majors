As a long time users of two little hands products, I really enjoy the variety of learning material, introduced in a way that is still highly educational and intriguing.",1430524800,,263,4.866666666666666
8687241,5,B00PB3R4SW,"We love Rachel and the Treeschoolers.  It is so educational and my 5 year old twins love Rachel.  When we go to the grocery store I am now required to buy fruits and vegetables of all colors so we can ""eat a rainbow"".  They know all the color signs and got upset when their crayon box did not have an appropriate indigo.  Cannot say enough wonderful things about this series.",1430524800,,375,4.314285714285714
8687242,5,B00PB3R4SW,We love Rachel and the Treeschoolers! My sons watched Signing Time when they were babies so we were excited for this new series that continues to integrate sign language while teaching lots of other fun things. Like Signing Time it has great music and is really engaging. My boys are 4 and 6 and they both really like it.,1430265600,,321,4.4576271186440675
8687243,5,B00PB3R4SW,"We LOVE Rachel and the TreeSchoolers.  We started watching when our daughter was 3 years old. She is now 4 and still loving all of the the TreeSchooler DVD's. ""It's very incredible"" says my daughter. Do you want your child to know how to be safe on the street? Stay healthy? This is a great show! Rachel is amazing and connects with the kids. Each of the animated characters are fun.  We are one of the original backers of this Kickstarter. For us, after the success of Baby Signing Time, Potty Time, and Signing Time, in our home, it was a no brainer to be a backer for Rachel and the TreeSchoolers! We are so thankful that Rachel and the gang decided that ""too educational for tv"" would not stop them from making a truly amazing show for kids who are ready to learn!",1430265600,,768,4.326388888888889
8687244,5,B00PB3R4SW,Treeschoolers are awesome! We've backed all of the TLH campaigns on Kickstarter. My 3 year old loves these shows. My 10 year old even gets caught up in them. My three teenagers have been caught humming the tunes. I can't say enough about how educational and inspirational these shows are. Love them!!!,1430265600,,301,4.8076923076923075
8687245,5,B00PB3R4SW,"As a Grandma of 3 hearing grandchildren, I cannot emphasize how helpful and amazing the TreeSchoolers series is!  It is an entertaining and upbeat series that keeps kids tuned in and learning. I originally started with Rachel's Signing Times series when my grandson was 8-9 months old to provide him with a communication tool, and I have never looked back.  I have given various DVD's to new parents, new grandparents and parents of children with various special needs.  This series is universal for ALL children and adults, too! A Winner in my book!",1430265600,,550,4.89247311827957
8687246,5,B00PB3R4SW,"As new parents we decided that we wanted to teach our daughter sign language from an early age.  That is how we found Two Little Hands production and their Baby Signing Time products.  As our daughter grew and developed we moved into their regular Signing Time products as well.  Since Two Little Hands Productions and Rachel have become a staple in our home, when I heard that they were launching a Kickstarter campaign for the Treeschoolers videos I was compelled to become one of their original backers even though my kids were too young for preschool videos.  My kids are now 16 months and 3 years old but the Treeschoolers videos are a favorite for both of them.  My 3 year old has learned how plants grow, how thunder and lightning are created, and the features that make an insect different from other animals.  These videos are not only very educational, but they make learning fun.  The characters are loveable, the songs are fun and will leave you and your kid singing them for days after you watched the video, and the content is presented in a way that helps kids learn the subject.  Being a proponent of teaching sign language to our kids, I have also been pleased that there is some sign language mixed into the lessons as well.
We have been backers for all of the Treeschooler campaigns and my kids both get excited when a new DVD shows up.  My three year old regularly bursts into songs from the show and my 16 month old gets excited when the videos come on and she claps her hands and dances around and signs more or again when the videos end.
You won't be disappointed with these videos content and your kids are sure to love them for years to come!  These are a valuable addition to your video library!",1430265600,,1721,4.487179487179487
