750919,4,6303928234,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I remember seeing this film back when I was young on an early show one afternoon. I don't recall a lot of what happened that day or the details of the movie from that early viewing with the exception of the fact that I enjoyed it and thought that the two leads did a great job with their characters. I liked it enough that years later when I came across the DVD release of this in a $5 bin I picked a copy up. So when I learned that Twilight Time was releasing this in blu-ray format I was happy to say the least. After watching it I remain happy.

The movie opens in Chicago with the arrival of cowboy businessman Tom Reese (Glenn Ford) arriving after having been on the trail. A longtime customer of the hotel he expects an entire floor for he and his men. The manager tells clerk Frank Harris (Jack Lemmon) to clear out the regular floor for Reese even though there are already guests there. Among them is Maria Vidal (Anna Kashfi), a woman Harris is in love with, and her family. Marias father wants her to have nothing to do with Harris and tells them they are leaving so no movie is necessary.

Making sure that Reese is comfortable Harris approaches him for a position with his groups of cowboys which Reese turns down. Unwilling to take on a new hand to train he gives him all the reasons not to be a cowboy and sends him out. Later, when Reese is losing at cards in the poker game he always enjoys when he arrives, he tells Harris to settle his bill. Harris asks if he needs cash to continue the game and gives him $3,000 that he has saved as long as he can be his partner. Borrowing the money Reese wins back his own.

The next day he regrets his decision and tries to give Harris back his money but Harris refuses. Now a part of the team he joins them for the trip back out west and the hopes of building himself a life as a cowboy with hopes of winning back Maria in marriage. The fact that Reese buys much of his beef from the Vidal family gives him an even better chance of making that dream come true.

But most of the movie focuses on life on the trail and Harris discovery that it is not the glamourous career he thought it was. Having grown up on a farm he knows hard work and actually does a decent job of becoming a cattleman. Reese, resenting the predicament he placed himself in, does not take it easy on Harris and rides him hard.

Harris dreams are filled with roadblocks and things never seem to turn out as planned. As Reese begins to soften towards Harris, Harris begins to become the harder man of the two, resented by the rest of his trail mates and destined to find himself in want of a friendly face. As the two men begin to switch roles their conflict with one another, as well as several others Harris finds himself in, will soon result in Harris either coming to terms with his new life or dying in the process.

While all of this might sound a bit somber and down the fact is there is plenty of humor to be found in the film as well. Certainly the various negative aspects of being a cowboy are on display here but the rewards are as well. Though various dangerous moments occur there are some funny ones as well. Lemmon, often cast in comedic roles is the more straight character here for the most part. Ford, who played cowboys in many films, is a natural as Reese and has some of the funnier moments. Seeing them work together in this way made for a memorable film.

The movie works on many levels. On one it is the classic western with cowboys, Indians, riding the range, desert vistas and danger on the trail. As the story of a young man growing into himself it works as well. And as a story of one man realizing that while he thinks he would rather not grow close to anyone in truth he has found a true friend.

Twilight Times blu-ray of the release is the best there is as always. Having watched the DVD version and now this one it is a much better way to enjoy the film. Extras are limited but enjoyable including an isolated score track, audio commentary track with Julie Kirgo, Paul Seydor and Nick Redman and an original theatrical trailer. Once again Twilight Time is limiting this to only 3,000 limited edition copies so fans of the actors, westerns or fun movies should make a point of ordering right away.",1456876800,,4311,4.27328431372549

750921,5,6303928234,"I just can't get enough of these westerns -- and they keep getting better.

THE COWBOY is another ""must own"" western that is highly, highly entertaining due to the fact that it stars Glenn Ford and Jack Lemmon as the unlikeliest of ""partners"" who herd cattle from Chicago to Mexico.

There's a great supporting cast, including Dick York (who would go on to do ""Bewitched"") and Strother Martin, who I wish had a bigger role in this film.

The transfer is immaculate. This is another stunning release from Twilight Time. It's always great to see a Technicolor film where you can appreciate the colors. The print is free of dirt and has its grain intact. Certainly better than Vera Cruz, which I talked briefly about above.

I just can't stop praising this film. It's such a delight to see a tough guy like Glenn Ford pair up with a meager hotel clerk played by Jack Lemmon, then put them both on a tough, dangerous and dirty trail. It's men learning to be men.

Make this a ""must purchase"" on your Twilight Time shopping list.",1456272000,,1024,4.543478260869565

751158,2,6303928234,"All the way through the movie I kept trying to find someone to root for. Initially Glenn Ford's character, Tom Reece, seems like a nice guy, but apparently he's only likeable when he's drunk. Once the trail drive starts he's so unlikeable, we assume Frank Harris (played by Jack Lemmon), the tenderfoot, is whom we're to identify with. Unfortunately, Jack Lemmon as a cowboy on a trail drive just didn't work for me. I kept seeing him as the neurotic guy from ""The Apartment."" He doesn't get the girl, he doesn't do anything very heroic, and he slowly turns as cold-hearted and unlikeable as Reece, the man he hates.

The theme of the movie is that the code of the West was ""Every man for himself."" No matter what kind of help the other guy needs, even if he's hurt or might get killed, you look out for Number One. Kind of hard to stand up and cheer for sentiment like that.

I also found the stunt work disappointing. Several fight scenes were done with stunt men who physically just didn't resemble Ford or Lemmon. And then there's the ""ringing the bull"" scene where the bull has rubber horns. And a particularly distasteful scene where chickens are buried up to their necks and cowboys ride by on horses and try to yank them out of the ground. (I know, I know, it may well be a realistic depiction of something that passed for fun in the Wild West, but it's still disturbing to watch.)

A great movie with a similar but better plot is ""Red River"" with John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. Or, if you like Glenn Ford, try ""3:10 to Yuma""--outstanding Western. ""Cowboy"" fell flat for me.",1372896000,2,1584,4.493055555555555

Watching Glenn Ford as a rough and tough larger than life cattle drover was like watching an Old West version of Captain Jack Aubrey: Ford's Reese loves music, whiskey, and women, but he's also a no nonsense leader and does not have much patience for 'lubbers' with romantic notions of riding horses for miles and sleeping out under the stars. Jack Lemmon as Frank Harris stars with Ford as the young man who is willing to face the ridicule of the trail-hardened cowboys to catch up with love.

This movie, as pointed out by other reviewers, did not cater to the usual romantic notions the 50s and 60s had about the Old West and its cowboys. If you read up on actual accounts of life on the trail and the kinds of men that were cowboys, you'd have a better sympathy for Reese and his crew.  They came from all walks of life and all manner of morals and foibles, some criminal, and the bottom line always served for their survival. Without the cattle all their travel and trials would be for nought. One can't blame them for thinking of preservation over the more random things that happen on the trail.

Some SPOILERS ahead:

The movie starts out with the announcement that the well known drover and his men were about to invade a posh hotel in Chicago like sailors on shore leave, and Frank Harris, concierge, is given the task of breaking the bad news to a rich Mexican rancher who is also taking up the exclusive rooms of the hotel. To complicate matters further, Harris has fallen madly in love with the sweet young daughter of the Rancher, and being Yankee, is not as well versed in the Old World values of the Mexican family. The father forbids the courtship and they leave the hotel with the intent to return to Mexico. Irony shows up in that Reese meets the Mexican rancher on the stairwell and it becomes obvious the two know each other and regard each other as friends.

Harris then tries to get in Reese's good graces to accompany him back down to Mexico for the next trail drive and only through some awkwardness concerning gambling debts does Reese relent. From there on out, Harris' notions about lands down south and the men who roam it are systematically destroyed, to the point of his own disillusionment and utter scorn for Reese. The men under Reese's employ are not always good hearted or noble, the cattle are not obedient, and Reese, blustery and commanding, measures all his judgements by how it will affect the money they will receive from bringing another herd up north. This, in Harris' eyes, is the epitome of hubris.

One thing I never did like about some of the movies from the 50s and 60s was the moralization that went on for things that Real World Americans understood as necessary - in Cowboy, how survival and economics spelled the doom or success of a drive, and  At one point in the film, Harris gets a sharp, bitter, and ugly dig in at Reese' reaction to the news of a close friend's death because, as an earlier incident had played out, Reese (nor any of the other cowboys) did not respond the way Harris thought he should. It was a bit of an unfair argument because Reese did not instigate the earlier incident. Harris was apparently willing to make a blanket judgement of Reese based on what one other person on the team did or did not do or say.

Apart from that, I reveled in this film, not just for the vistas shown, and the more realistic nature of showing a cattle drive, but just how imperfect and human cowboys were at that time. Ford was excellent (as always) and reminded me strongly of a favorite literary figure of mine, Jack Aubrey, Royal Navy captain, who loved his music, liquor and women as much as Reese did, and did not always rule fairly, but he did so with the intent to keep his men alive and deliver the promise of the prize.",1354579200,,3894,4.476056338028169
751229,4,6303928234,"While I was watching this large-scale technicolor western from 1958, I started thinking of all the wonderful westerns we had from this period and do not have anymore.  Interestingly, the trailer for this film, that I watched afterward, focused on a man watching a western on tv in black and white, and then turned to one of the stars of the film , Jack Lemmon, advising us that if we wanted to see this large scale, color western, we would have to see it in our local movie theater.
Anyway, the plot of the film has a tenderfoot from Chicago, a young and handsome Jack Lemmon, joining a cattle drive run by the rough and tough Glenn Ford in order to earn money to marry the lovely Mexican debutante whose father has no use for him.  Along the way, Lemmon grows into a real man and like in a scene out of ""Red River,"" eventually takes over the herd after Ford is shot and wounded in an Indian raid.  The film is surprising grim in many parts.  Early on an innocent cattle drover, (played by a young Strother Martin,) is needlessly killed while some of the cowboys fling around a rattlesnake for laughs and nobody but Lemmon, who really didn't even know the man, gives a crap.
The billing on the film is interesting.  Glenn Ford's name is featured in much bigger letters than Lemmon's despite both having equal parts.  Yet when Lemmon passed away a few years ago, it was big news while Ford's death got about like 2 paragraphs in my local newspaper.  People forget what a big star Ford was in the 1950's and most of the '60s, before his film career dried up and he had to turn to television (like so many others including Rock Hudson, James Stewart, Kirk Douglas, Yul Brynner, etc.)  Ford starred equally in dramas, (""Blackboard Jungle,"" ""Experiment in Terror,"" ""Fate is the Hunter,"" etc.) comedies (""Teahouse of the August Moon,"" ""Don't Go Near the Water,"" ""Courtship of Eddie's Father,"" etc.) and westerns (""The Sheepman,"" ""3:10 to Yuma"" ""Cimmaron,"" this film and many others.)  He should be better remembered than he is.
The quality of the DVD is okay: some of the picture quality is very good, other scenes have those annoying squiggly little lines at the top of the screen.  I watched it on my blu-ray player.  In conclusion, ""Cowboy"" is a pretty good film, sort of like a more realistic episode of ""Rawhide.""  As stated previously, it is the type of a  good comfortable color western that they made in the 1950s but do not make anymore, and that is a shame.",1334361600,,2461,4.540723981900452
751230,4,6303928234,"I saw this movie when it first came out and I must admit it made quit an impression on me as a kid of about 10 years old.  Even at that age I was a bit tired of the Hollywood version of the ""old west"" a part of our history that lasted only about 20yrs.

I have the VHS version of this movie and as far as I'm concerned it still holds up as one of the best westerns of the '50s (it is not Shane, but what movie is).  As stated by a few others here this is a somewhat real slice of life on the trail (tho the set-up is a bit contrived).  The movie at least shows the guy not getting the girl, so not a tottaly happy ending.

However I do recommend that you watch this movie.",1320537600,,672,3.7375886524822697
751231,4,6303928234,"I purchased this DVD as I recently started getting into Cowboy movies and I have to say this one really did catch my attention. Glenn Ford is always perfect in any role he plays but Jack Lemmon was remarkable. Watching Jack start off as a happy go lucky sort(as a bellhop) and slowly turning hard and tough(as a cowboy) was so believable. I highly recommend this story for those who enjoy a good western,Glenn Ford or Jack Lemmon. I thoroughly enjoyed all three.",1318896000,,462,4.578313253012048
751232,5,6303928234,"Columbia Pictures presents ""COWBOY"" (1958  92 min/Color) -- Starring: Glenn Ford, Jack Lemmon, Anna Kashfi, Brian Donlevy, Dick York & Richard Jaeckel

Directed by Delmer Daves

Chicago hotel clerk Frank Harris (Jack Lemmon) harbors romantic notions of the West and prevails upon hard-living, hard-drinking trail boss Tom Reese (Glenn Ford) to take him along on Reese's next cattle drive. In the months that follow, Harris' idealized notions of the West are cruelly dispelled, though he eventually becomes accustomed to the rough-and-tumble life on the trail and to the curious camaraderie between the drovers

The once-scandalous autobiography of Frank Harris was the source of the fascinating ""adult"" western Cowboy. Note the memorable performance of Hollywood veteran Brian Donlevy as Doc Bender, an aging gunfighter who can't stand the notion of becoming an anachronism.

One of the more unorthodox westerns of the 1950s, but also one of the best.

In the trailer Mr. Lemmon describes the film as being in glorious technicolor and broad as the movie screen to capture all the scope of the outdoor locations.  But this version is TV ""Full Screen"" with no widescreen option.  And I've looked and can't find this movie in a widescreen format.

751236,4,6303928234,The tender-foot who proves he can learn his lessons all too well.  It is a classic western story with that quintessential cowboy legend in Glenn Ford juxtaposed against the tender-foot played well by Jack Lemmon.  The contrast and comparisons make for an interesting and moral tale of how two very different men learn from each other the lessons of human dignity and respect.  Very well played and very entertaining classic western tale.,1203292800,3,437,5.041666666666667

751309,4,6303928234,"Based on a true story written by Frank Harris, the Jack Lemmon role, about his experiences on a cattle drive. Glenn Ford is good & Jack Lemmon is well-cast as the tenderfoot. I know, Jack Lemmon wasn't known for westerns but don't knock him until you watch him. I've never read the book & I highly suspect that the movie is a very condensed version. Jack Lemmon's character takes an incredible turn of personality about two-thirds of the way through the story. Not a classic but the combo of Glenn Ford & Jack Lemmon is an interesting one.",1192492800,2,539,4.510204081632653

I like Glenn Ford's understated acting, and, of course, Jack Lemon was an excellent foil.  Don't know how they filmed the scene where Ford 'ringed the bull', but it looked real enough to me.",1163116800,5,263,4.346938775510204
751313,5,6303928234,"O.K. so it's Black and white pretty horrible quality and the audio doesn't do justice to what it must have really sounded like. I still would love to see these movies restored.  The musical finale of ""The cowboy and the Senorita,"" is lavish and actually gives me goose-bumps and pride to see how wonderfully done this musical was. Wow! It's light-heartedly, funny too!  The song ""Enchelada man"" who goes around ""spreading indigestion"" is hilarious. Roy and Dale are together on all these movies. Such wonderful singers! Also the movie ""Home in Oklahoma"" has the musical number ""Showboat"" which also is very lavishly done for that time period. It would have been thrilling done in today's color and surround sound. Sons of the Pioneers sing ""Tall timbers calling (or falling?)"" is another great harmony number done boldly! At one point Roy rides out on Trigger and sings and you can see Trigger's wet eyes while Roy sings his happy optimistic cowboy song.  It just makes you feel good! He has charisma presence even on this old B & W.  We need heroes and they are certainly here.",1143417600,9,1078,4.779569892473118

Here he is city-slicker..wanting to move cattle with Mr. Ford. And good old Glenn takes him up on offer,only because he lost money playing poker. It's a western that moves right along...actor,Dick York is very good in his role also. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5-stars is..the dvd...should have been in widescreen. Westerns are outdoor adventures..it needs the Scope of the west. Columbia is getting very cheap lately. All they had to do is give both versions. I seen his western on Turner classic and taped it.

751318,4,6303928234,"There are some movies that force you to contemplate issues swimming in the deep end of the pool.  The dvd for COWBOY contains a few trailers, one for COWBOY itself.  In it star Jack Lemmon proudly boasts that COWBOY is ""really the best, really the west.""  Amen, brother.  The cattle drive this movie takes you on is unlike most others, an adult western as they measured such things in the late `50s.

 Lemmon plays tinhorn Frank Norris, a hotel clerk who has a romantic notion about the cowboy life, and Glenn Ford plays Tom Reese, cattle boss and ramrod teflon-coated against the romance of the open range, who reluctantly takes Lemmon on.

  There's a dispensable romantic subplot to this one, included only to provide Lemmon with a breakable romantic notion and a reason to want to go south (his forbidden love lives with a protective father in Mexico.)  COWBOY is about what happens on the trail, and not much of it is good. Ford's trail gang contains an assortment of  deviants and sociopaths enough to make a barbarian blush.  Among the wranglers is a character who ate the ""left haunch"" of a Comanche warrior and is ribbed unmercifully for it.  A prank turns fatal and rather than meditate on the meaning of life, the instigator attempts to steal the victim's boots.  When an amorous wrangler precipitates a brutal fight with a jealous boyfriend and his gang the wrangler's pardners vamoose before the knives are drawn.  COWBOY has a strong anti-romantic message; life on the trail is a dehumanizing experience.  Lemmon is at first horrified and then embittered, his anger mainly directed at boss Ford for allowing it.  An interesting and nice feature of this smart film is watching the Lemmon and Ford characters evolve along the drive.  Lemmon turns hard and mean, while Ford softens up a bit.

  The intelligent script is the work of Edmund North and an uncredited Dalton Trumbo.  It's based on Frank Harris's My Reminiscences As a Cowboy (1930), one of many real-life cowboy stories published in the first few decades of the twentieth century.  Texan historian and folklorist J. Frank Dobie called Harris's book ""a blatant farrago of lies"".  Dobie's judgment is what led me to the deep end.  COWBOY was obviously marketed as an adult ""really"" real alternative to the sugar-coated pap westerns of the 50s.  I'm not quite sure what a ""blatant farrago"" is, but I assume Dobie was in a high lather when he wrote that.  In any event, one side says realistic and the other blatant lies.  I guess I'd call it myth-busting, probably a lot more shocking in 1958 than it is today.  We've been bombarded with a series of myth-busting real west Western in the last fifty years.

On the first pass it seems odd to cast Lemmon and Ford in a western.  They're more urban characters, and the 50s were saturated with competent Western actors. My guess it was a conscious decision by director Delmer Daves (who directed Ford in the classic 3:10 TO YUMA the previous year) to go against the grain some.

 Warning - those offended by scenes of animal cruelty should be aware that in one scene chickens are buried up to their necks and cowboys compete to pull them out while riding galloping horses.  Those offended by chintzy props shouldn't play too close attention to the scene with the fierce bull and his a-little-too-obviously red rubber horns.",1097539200,25,3340,4.771378708551484
