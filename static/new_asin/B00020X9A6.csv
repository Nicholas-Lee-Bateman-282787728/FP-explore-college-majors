8019798,5,B00020X9A6,"I bought this to help me complete my Tenchi GXP collection. I love this movie/series. Didn't think that I would, since I'm usually not a fan of spin-offs--especially not when it comes to my beloved Tenchi series, but this is still as funny as the original, but has new characters and new adventures. We don't see much of the main cast, but they do make a few return appearances. Just as perverted as the regular Tenchi cast, I'm glad that I bought this--bundle of laughs on every disc!",1361318400,,485,4.5227272727272725
8019799,3,B00020X9A6,"Seina and his shipmates are still traveling through space acting as pirate bait. They accidentally stumble upon the most feared space pirate of all, Ryoko Balta. This isn't the Ryoko we remember. She's attacking fiercely. I would say it looks like the end, but the series is only half over.

This volume isn't bad or good. It's just average. The whole series has very rushed and average feel to it. I did, however, like the new character, Ryoko Balta. Some of the other characters in this series are okay too. Overall they are not developed well enough to make you love them. This series is kind of a waste of time really. There are many more anime shows out there that need attention first.",1353110400,,691,4.57258064516129
8019800,3,B00020X9A6,"This DVD contains episodes 12-14 of GXP; for full descriptions of the series, I suggest checking out the excellent Tenchi Muyo: Another Universe (...). The quality of the animation and character art is terrible; it's obvious that it was turned out as quickly and cheaply as possible, especially in episode 12. The jokes are often cheap and lame, careful comic timing is almost nonexistant, and easy, sleazy T & A gags abound (although real nudity is forbidden).
Still, it's fun and diverting most of the time; the characters and backstory are what save the show. There is no attempt at more than a few moments of seriousness, and over-the-top humor and utter silliness just just keep on coming. Seina is still the inexplicable object of lust of a huge number of gorgeous, powerful, and jealous women. There is an interesting (although utterly out of character) cameo from Ryoh-Ohki, Lady Seto's husband makes an appearance, NB is just as perverted and sneaky as ever, Ryoko Baluta joins the GXP, and a new cabbit appears as a central character. Make sure to watch it with the second subtitle track running; the first track is just a word-for-word repeat of the dub, but the second is a more literal translation from the Japanese original. The differences are often so huge that you occasionally have to wonder what show the English dub writers were watching.
If they follow the pattern of the previous DVDs, the next one should include episodes 15-17, which include Seina's visit to earth and encounters with Tenchi and ""family"", which ought to be the high point of the series (other than the way-gonzo final episode). Watching this series has become a guilty pleasure. You know it's just not very good, but it just pulls you in anyway.",1089763200,5,1736,4.848484848484849
