7915656,3,B00002E251,"The thing about this DVD is that unfortunately there are only two songs of HEART, Why they had to share the time running and the credits with another regular bands? ( to this day, the most important band in this DVD is HEART. Isn't it?):

1. ""Magic Man"" (A great live performance from '76, with original band members) and
2. ""Barracuda"" ( A playback performance with original band members).

Is a real document for Heart fans; although it's very few time for an important band like this. Why not the complet concert presentation?... There is in the market 4 or 5 CD compilations of the group, but none (in DVD format) about the starting carer of the Wilson sisters. WHY?... Good Luck!",1158796800,,684,4.598360655737705
7915657,4,B00002E251,"I picked up on this six song electronic blast for less than one dollar plus shipping, and after one viewing I surely have gotten my money's worth.  The best tracks are Procol Harum's ravaging rendition of Simple Sister (""simple sister, got whooping cough, lock her in a cell, throw the key into the sea, hope she never gets well"" ...what kind of song is that, anyway?), delivered straight forward with some intense lead guitar, Free's tight and gritty 'All Right Now', and Humble Pie's acoustic-blues version of the Yardbird's 'For Your Love'.

Sandwiched between these gems is Badfinger's 'Rock Of All Ages', another driving rock number featuring crisp vocals but undistinguished instrumental support (and relatively poor filming, offering few close-up images of the band members), 'Alice Cooper' decked out in full glam-rock regalia, looking for all the world drugged-and-gothed-out, ripping through 'Under My Wheels', and the weakest track of the bunch, Nazareth delivering a slow-down blues version of 'Morning Dew', all about those young girls, boys, and men cryin'.  Excepting 'Monrning Dew', all of these tracks are delivered with a bit more of the psychedelic graphics than you would wish, especially Free's track, where clear, actual shots of the band are few and far between.  It's one blazing track however.

While a longer version of the Procol Harum performance for Musikladen is available on VHS, other tracks by the artists featured here are nowhere to be found at the moment, and for all I know don't even exist.  If the makers of the Musikladen series release any more of this material from Free or Humble Pie however, I would make every effort to readily acquire them.  Hearing Humble Pie in acoustic mode is especially entertaining.  The Procol Harum tape is now high on my ""to purchase"" list as well.  Stunning stuff, the likes of which is surely in short supply.  Go for it.",1116460800,,1895,5.02555910543131
7915658,5,B00002E251,"Just watching Martha Davis of The Motels performing ""Total Control"" is worth the buy. Live performances from Bonnie Tyler, The Motels and Suzy Quatro are rare and hard to find, so anything that comes along is more than welcome.",1105660800,2,227,4.846153846153846
7915659,3,B00002E251,"I enjoyed this video of rare footage from some of my favorite 70's bands like Humble Pie, Alice Cooper, and Badfinger but the entire video only last 30mins. It would be nice to see 3 or 4 songs from each band and extra footage like interviews if possible. I would like to see more stuff like this released on 70's bands.",1060560000,,320,4.262295081967213
