2546918,5,B000EZ7ZXQ,"The island is Hawaii, a temporary paradise for many women; the man on the island is Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) also a temporary paradise. Unwilling to commit to anyone or thing but his boat.

Then he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). After an accident she has lost her ability to transfer short term memory to log term. So every day since the accident is erased and she starts over. So the relationship starts from a bet and ends up who knows where if any where.

At first it the film looks just like any old Adam Sandler film that only Sandlerights could like. Then it settles down to cute. Then it settles down to meaningful, finally you forget that you are watching a movie and then it is over. Drew excels in this movie and is very believable.

The film would have come off a lot better with out all the Sandleright left over characters that contributed zip to the story. The two that came to mind is the brother Doug Whitmore (Sean Astin). And the what-not Alexa (Lusia Strus.)

Another warning is that the version of DVD had a bunch of coming attractions after paying good money I do not need forced attractions at the beginning. Wait for a better release or just press the ""Menu"" button to escape them.

2546920,5,B000EZ7ZXQ,"Great Romantic Comedy for everyone. This is about a player living in Hawaii who has one night stands with the hot women vacationing there. He soon realizes that he wants something more and decides to give up that lifestyle. While eating breakfast he sees Drew Barrymore and its love at first sight. For him. He goes to her table and talks with her and they hit it off right away. They talk throughout breakfast when she realizes she is late for a meeting. They make a date to meet at the same place the next morning. The next morning he shows up and sees her already sitting at the table. He approaches her and sits down. He starts talking and she kinda freaks out saying I don't know you, I've never met you before and runs out of the restaurant. The lady who owns the restaurant explains the situation. She has short term memory loss. She will never remember him. She lives the same day over and over and has been for over a year. He refuses to give up so every day he thinks of different ways to break the ice and talk to her. He tries to get her to love him each and every day. Sometimes it goes well and sometimes it doesn't. He refuses to believe that she isn't starting to remember him when everyone else knows that isn't true and tries to get him to stop wasting his time.",1224288000,3,1280,4.25

2546923,4,B000EZ7ZXQ,I like this movie - I found it amusing and entertaining. It's a unique story.

2546951,5,B000EZ7ZXQ,"The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment.
Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.",1474243200,,1609,4.402684563758389

I really liked this movie because of the fact it was a comedy but yet a romance. The plot line is one that is becoming used more where the man has to continually make the girl fall in love with him. A good movie to have in your collection.",1340323200,,363,3.8533333333333335
2547044,4,B000EZ7ZXQ,"As the movie starts it gives a feeling of just another story of promiscuous behavior in a beautiful setting, Hawaii, but as it continues and the Drew Barrymore character, Lucy Whitmore, is introduced it suddenly becomes more significant and meaningful. The Adam Sandler character, Henry Roth, begins to develop some depth as a human being as he discovers the plight of the very lovely Lucy, begins to see her as something more than a sex object, and develops a concern for someone other than himself.

The movie takes place in Hawaii with all of the beautiful scenery you would expect in that locale. The casting is well done with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler both creating sympathetic characters about whom the viewer begins to care. The supporting roles are all performed with competence so that the total package is very rewarding.

Both the sound and video on the Blu-ray version are excellent so there are no complaints in that department.

There is course language and sexual innuendo especially in the beginning of the movie, and some scattered throughout but the later scenes are handled with less crudity. All told it is a satisfactory movie although I can't recommend it for young children especially the first few minutes of the movie.",1320105600,2,1249,4.938095238095238

2547047,4,B000EZ7ZXQ,"I have to admit that I am not a big fan of many of Adam Sandler's movies. I thought he was funny on ""Saturday Night Live"" but I find many of his movies dissappointing. Some I find just not good (""Zohan"") while others I find good for a while then they lose steam.(""Chuck & Larry"", ""Click"" ""Spanglish"") Most of his movies I'll find some funny or amusing bits but not enough to sustain a whole movie. I keep watching Sandler movies and finally I've found one that is very good from start to finish.
""50 First Dates""_is a very good movie with a clever premise, a good script and a good supporting cast, especially leading lady Drew Barrymore.  I've liked some of his other films (""Big Daddy"" ""Bedtime Stories"") but not as much as this one. It shows that given a good script, Sandler can make good movies. A very solid 4 stars here.",1295049600,3,827,4.37012987012987
2547048,5,B000EZ7ZXQ,"If you like Sandler movies, this is a great one. If you liked the wedding singer, you'll like this one too.

The blu-ray version is awesome, great definition and clarity of picture and the audio leaves nothing to be desired.",1281830400,2,224,4.6
2547049,4,B000EZ7ZXQ,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-First-Dates/dp/B0001Z3TXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 First Dates</a>&nbsp;is absolutely charming. Adam Sandler's girlfriend (Drew Barrymore) loses her short-term memory, so he must find a way to save their relationship when she doesn't remember it. Of course, it's totally unrealistic, but nonetheless heart-warming. This is a light-hearted movie and doesn't really get philosophical about amnesia and love, but it's good for a relaxing date movie.

 The movie also has adorable penguins and walruses and other animals, which make great supporting characters. Rather than Adam Sandler seeking advice from wise old men, he asks the walruses - with bizarre consequences!",1269648000,,744,6.739583333333333
2547050,5,B000EZ7ZXQ,"Henry Roth lives in a Hawaiian paradise with the company of endless women with no strings attached. This is until he meets Lucy Whitmore. Both Henry and Lucy enjoy the company of each other and feels the start of a serious relationship occurring. Approaching Lucy the next day, Henry is confused when Lucy fails to recognise him. This is the moment Henry discovers that Lucy actually suffers from short term memory loss and can't remember each individual day. Henry won't let this stop him and is prepared to make her fall in love with him all over again, each and every day. The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the movie believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. This is quite simply a very enjoyable movie. It's not, perhaps, a great movie, but it is fun and leave you feeling pleasantly content.",1265673600,,869,4.723684210526316
