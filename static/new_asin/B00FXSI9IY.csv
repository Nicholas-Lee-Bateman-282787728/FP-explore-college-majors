6036569,5,B00FXSI9IY,"This documentary tackles a subject that many have profiled before, but goes a step further in clearly identifying the political mechanisms behind America's prescription drug frenzy. Abuse of narcotic painkillers and prescription tranquilizers have become pop culture staples, but there are 8000 + pharmaceutical drugs on the American market (up from under 1000 in the the 1970s),

Healthcare in America is astronomically expensive, and the plethora of new drugs launched on the market every year is ethically astounding, yet not surprising given the massive profits of this country's pharmaceutical industry. Direct-to-consumer advertising means prime time television is awash with commercials for the latest and purportedly greatest pills that can be had simply be ""asking your doctor."" This film aims to examine the dangers behind many common prescription drugs, as well as look at the reasons the FDA allows these drugs on the market, oftentimes without proper oversight. Long-term complications from many different types of drugs have left patients dead or maimed, and dependency on Rx drugs has overtaken addiction to drugs of the street variety, all under the noses of doctors, hospitals, and government regulatory agencies.

Prominent members of Congress are questioned by these documentarians, and the responses of prominent health economists stand out alongside them- the cycle of former Big Pharma executives retiring from the private sector only to take up positions in the FDA plays a vital role in the manufacturing and release of Rx pills that often cost a bundle, yet may or may not be beneficial to patients' long term health and recovery. Government health schemes like Medicare and Medicaid are used, alongside private insurance plans, to boost profits for the pharma companies, while medical school administrations are pressured to tow the line of pill-oriented healthcare while training the nation's future medics.

The human toll these filmmakers examine is sorrowful, but the Machiavellian political machine of the FDA-Big Pharma cartel that is pinpointed here is just plain infuriating. Prescription medication has a place in healthcare, but when drugs are being pushed onto the market (and onto the consumer) without thorough diagnoses and in the absence of a holistic approach to medicine, how much progress is really being made in America's goal of genuine health reform?",1393891200,35,2397,5.490514905149052
6036570,5,B00FXSI9IY,"I would had been a prime candidate for physciatric drugs when I was growing up from Junior high school thru middle adult life.  I am so lucky that I felt that I was on a soulful journey of expanding my potential and uniting my cousciousness with God's will and perfection.  I think that this saved me, in addition to the fact that in the 70's big pharma had not concentrated its sight on children.

In junior high I was thrown in with kids I didn't know, who were of a different ethnicity (and were close knitted) than me, had a very abusive and scary homelife, I stuttered, was obviously poorer than the other kids,etc.  I was lonely, shy, friendless, etc.  This made me very very sad, and I cried everyday while at school for the first semester.  These days I would have been FORCED TO TAKE a number of drugs.  But back then, I had very strong spiritual beliefs in a bigger purpose in life.  I believed that it was to learn lessons and to pay back karma - not necessarily for punishment, but for the purpose of developing empathy for others.  So that wrongful/hurtful actions to others would not be committed.  I believed I also had a guardian angel who loved me a lot (I felt it a lot and this sustained through many of my difficulties).

I believe that it was this guardian angel that led me to the section of the school library that housed self-help books on developing your ability to communicate better with others.  I read these books with a lot of interest and put into practice what I had read.  I became better and better at communicating with others and stuttered less and less.  I practiced storytelling, telling jokes, etc.  I had many many painful failures, but kept seeing ways to improve and kept trying.  In a short time, I and my teachers could see progress.  (I didn't tell my teachers what I had been reading).  I also developed good friendships with a few of my classmates.

Later, as a young adult, I suffered from extreme pangs of guilt for committing even the smallest error, I had a lot of fears, and I had a lot of panic attacks.  Once again, the perfect scenario for a multitude of drugs to be prescribed to me.  Through self-analysis, I began to realize that it was understandable for me to feel this way.  This took off the burden that I had of not being normal; in fact I enjoyed my sense of being different.  I was a single adult with some good friends, a good church to go to, but no family support.  I was disowned for deciding I couldn't take it anymore, and was abruptly thrown out onto the streets.  Fortunate for me my guardian angel led me to people who provided shelter, food, friendship, and a way and a chance for me to stand on my own feet.  I had many fears, etc. to deal with...But reading a book I think it's called ""Feeling the Fear and doing it Anyway"" helped me tremenously.

Even though I have been given opportunities for head drugs, I didn't feel right about it.  Even when a boss from hell situation drove me over the edge.  I took time from work (doctors orders) and attended cognitive stress related classes through my health provider.  One of the best things I did; I learned that I was being set up by my boss to do something drastic in order for her to terminate me.  She didn't get that chance ha ha ha.  I'm soooo glad that I didn't succumb to the advice of taking pharma meds to calm my stress, and dry my tears, etc.  Now as an adult in my mid-50's, I very very rarely have panic attacks.  I can spot them from afar and have learned effective ways of dealing with them.  I have learned that a panic attack is really just fear turning in on itself and usually has no or little ground in reality.  I believe that this is another term for ""free floating anxiety"".  I learned to feel the fear, and not allow it to upset me...once accomplishing this I found that over a relatively short period of time (usually hours, but sometimes a day or so) the panic attack dissolves on its own.

I have also learned to deal with issues by thinking and meditating it through, asking for the counsel of wiser people (well sometimes they are), through prayers, and coming to a decision that in the silence of my soul makes the most sense.  I also ask for God's will in the outcome.  Through this I have experienced a deep sense of satisfaction, even when my desire was different from what actually happened.  Sometimes I have been granted a deeper prospective on the situation, and later learned that my actions have been instrumental in helping others (if not me).  I find this deeply gratifying.

I have learned to find the lessons as well as the humor in life, and to find ways to help and serve my fellow brothers and sisters on this earth.  This is not the happy planet and we all need each other to lean on, learn from, and obtain support.

Thank you for putting such a comprehensive topic in the span of a 90 minutes.  You are serving your brothers and sisters by educating them, and helping them to look for other ways to grow healthy mentally.  Drugs for most of us, are just not the answer.  I remember a friend telling me approx. 25 years ago, that she noticed that people who abused drugs didn't grow psychologically.  Drugs stunt this growth.

DAMAGE EXPERIENCE WITH PHARMACEUTICALS:

I wish to add that I did not escape the big pharma trap of prescription drugs.  I was prescribed high blood pressure medication at the insistence that I was imminent for stroke.  My blood sugar went up from 91 to 393, with an average of 503 after approximately six months of steady usage.  I was given metformin and another blood pressure medication (I found out later) to rinse the metformin from my kidneys to avoid damage to them.  I kept forgetting to take the blood pressure medication (lisinpril) and my blood sugar went back down to normal 145; later I stopped the metformin and it went down further to 142. i also took a herbal remedy to regenerate the beta cells in the pancreas - Gymmena Sylvestre.  I escaped the drug merry go around, but didn't escape lingering damage,...I developed rhemutoid arthritis in my both hands along with joint pain, body aches, severe hot flashes, hair falling out, rapid heart beat, etc.. Most have gone away, but the arthritis I'm attempting natural remedies to get rid of it via natural methods.

I did a lot of research on medications side effects and found that the above side effects were normal, and that a large number of people approx 23% become diabetic after taking blood pressure medication over a period of time.  Also, my doctors told me that I would remain diabetic for the rest of my life.  I was given no hope whatsoever, and even laughed at when I asked what could I do to reverse the situation.

I'm off all medications and approximately 95% of the doctors I have encountered since then do not congratulate me, do not ask me how I did it.  I have friends in the same boat, and we are amazed by this.  You equate doctors with healing, so this is puzzling.  I stay away from doctors unless I have an injury or emergency for them to fix.

Through my research I have learned that your film American Addict is right on point.  The medical industry has become a for profit industry.  It invents diseases so that it will be able to treat people. It expands the number of ""sick"" people by lowering treatment guidelines. My own doctor was upset with me for not coming in for regular check-ups...because as she stated...""I don't have anything to treat you with.""  At the time I thought that this was a strange statement, but now knowing more about this industry, it makes sense...and it makes me very leery of our current medical profession.

I'm so glad that many of those in this profession are waking up to the harm that has been perpetrated and do not wish to be part of it. You are to be applauded...standing ovation sytle. It takes great courage, and it takes a need to not act or be persuaded by greed.  Sure you could be much much richer if you played along...but at what cost to your conscious, your soul???  This medical system is going to run this country into the ground.  My health insurance monthly premium used to approx. $50, now it is over $760 in 30 years.  My salary in that same time period has grown 3x's (via 4 yr degree); not over 12 times (where's my calculator when I need it).

I agree with medication for pain, but in the shortest period of time possible.  For those in chronic pain and long-term pain also medication needs to be provided to those as well, if there are NO OTHER NATURAL METHOD to help. I don't believe people should suffer with pain.

Because of the Internet and movies like American Addict...people are waking up.  More and more people are saying ""no to drugs"" to their doctors.",1393632000,2,8713,4.4670886075949365

6036573,1,B00FXSI9IY,"Completely misses the point, possibly deliberately so, to pander to conservative audiences.  And in typical conservative-mentality fashion shifts the blame on addicts.  Hundreds of thousands of -- what would have been perfectly healthy -- Americans turned into addicts in the 90s onwards (I'm sorry, Obama has nothing to do with it), once Purdue Pharma got the green light from the FDA to market heroin-dose-equivalent medication (Oxycontin), and doctors started eagerly and blindly prescribing such medication for ankle sprains.  The whole history is very well-documented.  Instead, in this film I had to watch for one hour addicts beating themselves up (much of it 12-step-program indoctrination), as well as a garden variety of similarly minded counselors, officials etc hypocritically bashing addicts as sick people, and American society for accepting them.

Let me remind you: The lobbyists give money to the government representatives. They vote on behalf of said companies.

For example, one person would say the equivalent of a sentence or two, then the next viewpoint would be shared. However, the same people were featured in many segments. So I would say it was too segmented and I think that took away from the overall impact and quality. Having said that, I think information of this nature needs to be shared. Our country is in an opioid epidemic, and there's not just one cause. Is more broad based treatment the answer ? For those who are already an addict, perhaps. But how do you stop kids from trying drugs ? They come from all walks of life, rich and poor.

And they do not do so in the interest of ""the people"". Second, it touches on the many cultural issues that make this aberration possible, exposing the dysfunctional model of society we experience nowadays, of which the most painful instance is the addiction imposed by a glaringly irresponsible adult generation on the younger generation.",1482883200,,749,5.578947368421052

When a person is addicted or needs to use a drug, it is on them to get off it with counseling or prayer. Using a metal cage or to force a person off any type of drug is madness. People should have the right to take or refuse without another person demanding otherwise. Do I agree with anti-depressants? Nope, but its not up to me if a person uses it for relief.

It presents a very real and informative view on how reliant our society has become on prescription medications for every single ailment down to a sprained toe. I too have experienced being prescribed medication that was not needed. I experienced vertigo last year for the first time in my life but didn't know what it was. I went to the hospital (thinking I was dying lol) and the doctor told me I had vertigo. The doctor never really described what it was or how it was caused but gave me 4 different prescriptions. I went to get it filled at a Walgreens and when I went to pick it up, the guy behind the counter told me he called the hospital to verify that I had been prescribed Valium. 10 pills at 10mg a piece. He bumped it down to 5mg and told me that I don't need it.
I researched a bit on Valium after I got home as well as vertigo. Come to find out, Valium is a benzodiapine and is highly addictive. Not only that, but there is no need for it to treat vertigo which can and will go away on its own. So I just used what I needed from the antinausea/antidizzying medication. We are being prescribed medications to keep us inebriated, addicted, and sick that way others can profit from it. It's truly sad.

First there is the problem of addiction to prescription drugs. Interestingly, more people die each year from the use of prescription drugs that never should have been prescribed for them or from inappropriate dosages than from abuse of nonprescription drugs.  Of course there is also the problem of addiction to nonprescription drugs as well. Addiction to prescription medications, however, is driven by pharmaceutical companies and enhanced by fraud and government underfunding and incompetence in some regards. There also is the problem created by off-label uses that are encouraged by pharmaceutical companies. One may, as usual, also just follow the money. Company profits are staggering. This abuse is enabled by corrupt politicians, government employees, and drug companies. Unfortunately this is but one more example of fraud, greed, and the absence of integrity so rampant in today's society. This one, however, can literally kill you.

6036817,5,B00FXSI9IY,"So let wrap our collective minds around some simple facts. About 210,000 American men, women and children died last year from doctors medical malpractice and legal drugs and add to that about 80,000 American men, women and children killed by guns in America. Now let's divide 290,000 dead folk in America divided by 356 days and you get 814.6 dead ""HUMANS"" in America in an average day. There were 353 ""MASS SHOOTINGS"" of which only 2 involved Muslims so far this year but luckily with 13 days to go till Xmas, we should not eclipse ""1 MASS SHOOTING OF AMERICAN HUMANS IN THE YEAR, 2015"". So if every day in America about 814.6 people die...wait a secondlook at the middle of that number14 is the number of people that died in that one per average day/mass shooting on 12/2/2015 in San Bernardino, CA and ya all wanna fixate on that. You wanna go all mental about 14 and forget about the other 800 that day and the other 289,184 dead American people this year, most of which did not have it coming. I'm no genius but are we all idiots ? I'm not heartless, I care about those 14 people that died, their friends and family and the thousands of lives they've they touchedbut why do we just freak out and go buy more guns while the media and politicians sell cat food and channel more of our wealth to the rich. Are we addicted to the abuse and accept the way this $#!t is spun as just the way bizness gets done. Really, American media, government, and health care are the smartest and ""best"" guys in the room and this is the best protection we can expect. Considering there are about 1,250,000,000 Muslims, well, you do the math. That's 1.25 billion Muslims by the way.

I know it is difficult to leave your political leanings away from something like this but not doing that shows an intellectual dishonesty that is really a shame.

 I highly recommend this but I also hope you take this single focus blame game with a grain of salt and recognize that almost every member of congress is a corrupt human being out only for their personal financial and political gain.

My only concern is no mention of the other side of the coin - how much harder these regulations make it for people who really need medications. For example, I have ADHD. I spent years choosing to not do anything about it. I was diagnosed at least three times. Eventually I agreed to take medication for it and it has made a HUGE difference for me. It is the only drug I am on. But it is near impossible to get. Though my prescription has not changed and I have had no side effects I cannot get it renewed but have to see a doctor monthly. Which is expensive. Plus the drug. A friend once told me it was easier for him to get it illegally for his ADHD and I have to agree though I have never done it illegally. So on the one hand people get it who don't need it but for people who need it. I have no history of addiction. I don't even drink alcohol because I am a Muslim.

I was not born in the U.S. I came to this country six years ago. I am surprised by the amount of pharmaceuticals and surgeries people use in this country, and how comfortable they seem to be with this. It seems strange to my American friends that I do not take pills when I have a cold. That is because in my home country I was educated to let my body run its recovering process by itself. The symptoms we see, such as coughing and sneezing, are signs that our bodies are doing the repair work.

I think pills fit into a fast food culture very well, but there are really no quick and easy solutions for being healthy in the long term. I'm not saying we should not take pills at all, but the amount that I see people taking has been alarming to me. In the long term, eating more vegetables, sleeping decent amount of time, and exercising regularly are important for being healthy. This is what I learned from my grandma and from my teacher when I was a kid. It has been the most beneficial advice given to me.

Now that I've made it to a third paragraph, I guess I'll go ahead and say something about the film. It underscored several methods that pharmaceutical companies use to generate profit and some of the legislators that they lobby. It is insightful and well made!",1421884800,4,1363,4.337254901960784

I know, I am one of those patients.  I do require opiates in low doses for RLS and perhaps I am an addict since I should be taking this till I die of, hopefully, time.  But if I am an addict then I do not abuse the drugs nor pass them around.  It is a needed drug.  Other drugs that might be used cause horrible side effects yet they are drugs of choice (and cost `10-20 times as much).  There it goes back to the big pharmas.  Since the new legislation has recently come out, I cannot get the prescriptions I need.  My doctor is a specialist and decided not to prescribe schedule II prescriptions. Too bad, here is a referral to another doctor.  Oh, they can't see you for three months.  What to do?  What to do? It cost so much to try and find a doctor to work with you.  When you do then they change the rules and you have to start all over.  I know I am not the only one.  Talking on forums and with other patients, it is making legitimate patients miserable.

Now you have cops busts a person if they have one pill of hydrocodone that is not in a prescription bottle.  That is just getting stupid.  There is something utterly flawed with our country these days and it is just getting worse.  Very sad indeed.",1420675200,18,1445,4.208029197080292

Politicians create and maintain this situation.  Therefore patients must educate themselves and not blindly trust the system.""  I think these points are reasonably objective.

It depends how you look at the documentary and your personal expectations on the subject... that you will be disappointed or pleased. To me, this documentary confirms what I have been observing since I came to the US 13 years ago. I see a broken health care system (see also film: Espace Fire) in which Health Care is not a human right but a huge business. Fortunately, I have experienced both sides of the coin: A private system and a universal system (Spain). I choose by far Spain. This documentary makes the overall point that there is a huge problem with addiction to prescription drugs, and that some Pharma companys' ultimate purpose is not focused on peoples' health but $$$$, and they will use unethical strategies to make that $. And the leaders of the country will sell themselves for $$$. If you review the film, the advice at the end of the documentary is priceless because it is my experience, as a PhD in Health Sciences, that most physicians will prescribe what Pharma reps would teach them... We, the patients, the individuals must be inform and make wise decisions and not let ourselves be manipulated. I always seek several opinions before taking any drug, and most of the time I end up taking a natural alternative approach, such as exercise, meditation, more sleep, more water, some needed nutrients....

At the end, everyone watching this film can decide by himself/herself if there is value or not. To me there is great value. I am not saying that the film is very well done, etc. I don't care that much about that as much as the content.

6036905,1,B00FXSI9IY,"I currently work as a psychiatric nurse practitioner. I recently watched this film hoping to learn about ways to help patients overcome problems with prescription drug abuse issues. Instead of considering strategies or ways to help with addictive behaviors though, this film points the finger at mental health professionals by using a lot of poorly researched arguments.

First, we can all agree that pain medications are addictive. This is a huge issue. The pain medication issue is brought up in the beginning of the film. Yes, hydrocodone, OxyContin, ect. These are very addictive drugs. They should only be used for short term management of pain. Yes. People overdose and die on these medications. I was in full agreement with this. This is a widely accepted fact.

But then, the film makes a huge leap to compare pain medications with anti-depressant medications.  First of all, these drugs are not anywhere on any spectrum or any category classified with the addictive nature as pain medications. Of course, their reasoning for describing Prozac as addictive is never explained.  I can only assume that they make this argument because Prozac is typically given chronically(lifetime) after multiple depressive episodes because the risk of relapsing when off Prozac is near 100%. Also, though Prozac should not be stopped abruptly, because of withdrawal symptoms, it can be easily tapered off of and people do not crave Prozac or go out of their way to seek it. Why?  It just simply isn't a drug people abuse. Also, when has anyone ever seen someone ""high"" or experiencing any drug induced euphoria from Prozac? Those are typically why addicts like drugs right?  Even on a technical level, the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is associated with addictive cravings, is not at all affected by Prozac.  But no reason for describing Prozac as a supposedly highly addictive drug was ever given. It was just assumed Prozac could be grouped with pain medications. I guess the makers of the film just felt they could get away with not explaining any of this by opening the movie with the actually addictive pain killer type medications.

So the film continues to just attack psychiatrists. How again this started as a film about pain medication addiction and turned into an attack on the psychiatric profession again is beyond me.

So the comment is made that psychiatrists cannot make proper treatment decisions because they are given too much information from big pharmaceutical companies. This leads to almost justify a need for insurance companies to regulate prescribers because they are unable to properly prescribe with all this supposed misleading information they are given from pharmaceutical companies.

Though this film makes it impossible to believe. In order to prescribe these medications, schooling is required which actually teaches us about prescribing. In these  psychopharmacology classes we are taught about every medication. So believe it or not, prescribers learn the differences between all of these drugs in school. We are even taught about these supposedly elusive newer medications. Yes, we learn the side effects. We are even taught about the effects on the brain at a chemical level that the movie doesn't bother to go into. So, the fact that a $5 free sandwhich lunch would actually persuade prescribing is ludicrous. By the way, there are limits on the amount of money these reps can spend on us. We aren't even given pens anymore because some lawyer thought that was influencing prescribing. Really?!  Has a logo on a pen ever been that persuasive?!  And it is even funnier that they try to make the argument that pharm industry only employs attractive women. This almost creates a sexist approach to medicine. I am pretty sure everyone is well aware at this point that sometimes, these prescribers are female. Unless they are lesbians I just do not see how these points again are even logical arguments.

So, it almost leads me to wonder if united health care or another major health insurance company funded this movie. In reality, patients are often quickly denied necessary treatments because people with absolutely no medical knowledge within the insurance companies deny coverage. I will have patients who have been violent in the past who have been stable for years on a medicine. The insurance companies will deny their medications that have kept them stable and then give no valid reasoning for their decision other than that these medications are now not considered as a first-line treatment option. Now, these patients cannot get their medication because some insurance company with (again) no real medical knowledge finds their medication unnecessary. So, when this happens those patients will often start to become symptomatic and if violence was a previous pattern. Guess what?  So, this is a situation that leads to events like shootings and then everyone wants to know how this person got taken off of their medication...

Then, the discussion on zyprexa. The argument is made that because of pharmaceutical representatives that prescribers are giving newer medications like zyprexa, instead of older medications that they say do ""exactly the same thing.""  This was almost comical. They fail to even name these older medications. Which had to be purposeful. Because if you were to look up these older anti-psychotic medications like haldol or Thorazine, what you would learn is that those medications caused awful side effects that include movement disorders(comparative to Parkinson's disease) and even blindness. But yes, zyprexa can lead to diabetes. But prescribers are all knowledgable on following lab values of patients on these drugs and can address it if diabetes were to become an issue. But it is never, never recommended to use an older anti-psychotic because their movement disorder side effects are permanent!  And if they had again bothered to go into the differences between older anti-psychotic drugs vs newer ones you would have all learned that they do not work on the neurotransmitters in the brain in anyway the same way.

So, this is what happens when the media and documentary films become more accessible than mental health care. Because you get a situation where misinformation like this spreads. All these films accomplish is that they make mental health care less accessible by increasing the stigma of mental health care by pointing fingers at the professionals that are out there helping this population.

The reality of the situation is this. When diagnosis are made, it is often done in a setting where there is not enough time to adequately assess completely and fully. Sometimes, simple screening tools are used which are never recommended as a replacement for a full psychiatric evaluation. Often, primary care providers are left to treat mental health disorders in which they have never been fully trained because people cannot afford to access psychiatrists due to limitations that insurance companies make on their coverage. Then you have people taking what they are experiencing in these instances and applying them to the entire mental health community in general.

So, I really hope that awareness of mental health spreads. But it does absolutely no good to start any of these discussions by pointing fingers at the prescribers who are there trying to help these patients.

** Not all mental illness can be helped with therapy alone. **
This is just a fact that needs to be known.

It is important for therapists within the community to recognize the role of psychotropic medications in mental health care. I recommend therapy to all of my patients and absolutely recognize the need for more therapists to treat these lower income patients. The best treatment incorporates both approaches. There have been numerous studies to support this statement. But honestly, when I go to recommend therapy to them. There aren't any available. Why?  Very few are out there helping these poorer patients and most do not take any insurance.

So, in order to really help people with mental illness, awareness is needed on all levels. This includes acknowledging the value of medications and incorporating them within a therapeutic model. This is especially crucial for those patients that have major mental illness that absolutely require medications.",1412467200,39,8321,5.168773234200743

Now, after almost 40 years of infiltration into our regulatory process, universities of so-called higher learning, agriculture and medicine, we the People have given corporations so much leverage it will take a miracle to undo the damage. The problem has gotten so big: after watching a film like this it's hard to know where to begin the healing. Getting - and staying - informed is a good start. I would not look to these corrupted institutions to save us, as someone else had commented. It is an individual's responsibility to bear, hopefully with the help of a tight knit local community if you're lucky enough to live in one.
