7899675,5,6819903197,I love that they had a good ending.  Lee Min Ho is a great actor. Jun Ji-Hyundai is a funny actress. I enjoyed her at My Love is from A Star also.,1518912000,,146,3.5625
7899676,5,6819903197,"Mermaids always fascinated me and this story is a really beautiful story, particularly the part that deals with the old Joseon era legend, which is the best part of this K-drama in my opinion.

The songs are also very nice.",1509926400,4,223,4.575
7899677,5,6819903197,"I had seen this previously and really enjoyed it. I knew I would watch it over and over so I decided to purchase the series.  This isn't what I would call serious drama but  I loved the characters and it was laugh out loud funny at times.  Of course, since its a kdrama, there was a darker element running through it.  There is Lee Min Ho who is always a fan favorite, however, I think Jun Ji-hyun was terrific.  She is one of my favorites and really a great comedic actress.  This is a light hearted and a good movie for those new to kdramas.",1508025600,3,543,4.123809523809523

7899679,1,6819903197,"1. Technically, too many instances of different language subtitles superimposed over each other. Poor attention to detail which is needed for a good movie.
2. CGI and modeling of mermaid's tail all the way to the part that it was obviously covering breasts looked cheap, definitely not real (seamlessly no other parts associated with a living creature), and plainly poorly thought out. Another lost attention to detail.
3. Acting was robotic photo-op pretty - attractive actors doing little else than pose for the camera. Dialogue was inane. Nothing likable about characters and their behavior, ethics.
4. Script/story of last mermaid (how?) with makeup (lipstick, etc.) reincarnating on her own with help from a bracelet appearing hundreds of years apart was unimaginative children's tale fantasy. Most of the film is her contemporary adjustment to modern civilization (learning to speak; how glass doors can not be walked through, eating, etc.) which was rom-tragi/com TV series meant to be funny and/or tragic, and finally ends up boringly predictable.
5. Ruined another ancient asian folk tale for the daytime TV series romantic demographic. They should have learned from ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho (Nine-Tailed Fox)"".",1501977600,,1222,5.403141361256544
