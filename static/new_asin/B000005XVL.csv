2738281,5,B000005XVL,"A fantastic film based on Lawrence's autobiographical novel of his time spent in Australia. Judy Davis gives a marvelous performance as Lawrence's wife, Freda.
Arriving in Australia, the couple are befriended by neighbours and Lawrence's character is drawn into ""politics and red hot treason"". He is compelled, as a writer, to write of it and this is his downfall, as the men around him see this as a betrayal.
The film asks questions about the meaning of relationships - especially male camaraderie, and takes a close look at how ideologies evolve into violence.
A pity it's not better known. I recommend it.",1109116800,11,609,4.980392156862745
8170486,5,B000005XVL,we loved the movie. you can get lost in the story . very well written.,1524182400,,70,3.7333333333333334
8170487,5,B000005XVL,"If you like watching a film version of a novel before reading it, you'll love this one. Judy Davis is *amazing* (as usual)  as a character based on Frieda Lawrence, and the guy who does Lawrence isn't bad either. Kudos to Amazon for streaming this one, another example of how they're blowing away Netflix's streaming service.",1513296000,,325,4.803571428571429
8170488,5,B000005XVL,"This is a curious film that describes a mind committed to finding itself amidst political view points and factions that are struggling to gain force as well as form.  See this to get a glimpse of a writer striving to find how and if he can fit into the mix of germinating elements within a country that undergoes a new cycle of emergence.

There are beautiful scenes of a strange natural world and horrible ones of men who attempt to play a guiding role in gathering a nucleus and  stance to move a nation forward, somehow, in some direction.  This swirls around the dynamic of a husband and wife who can't quite settle on what the nature of their dynamic might be 10 years into their partnership challenged by living in exile.  This film is an interesting mix that some viewers found boring.  Hopes are that others will not find it so.  It is a rare examination of something we do not often see.",1506211200,,896,4.426829268292683
8170489,1,B000005XVL,"Incredibly boring.  I gave this one 30 minutes, and all I could think of was that the writer could not even clean up the back yard with junk lying all over the place.  He may be been a writer, but quite the pansy out of place anywhere earthy.  I thought were it not for the wife, there would have been no story at all.",1505865600,,318,3.9375
8170490,5,B000005XVL,"What  an incredible movie.  Having lived in New Mexico, D.H. Lawrence is well-known amongst the residents.  I didn't realize he had this Australia experience, however, and that it involved both the fascists and socialists vying for him to be their mouthpiece.  I found it all quite interesting.",1505606400,,294,5.191489361702128
8170491,1,B000005XVL,"Looks like some one scanned this from a VHS tape at the wrong aspect ratio. Inexcusable. Might be worth a second star for D.H. Lawrence fans, IF the video were not torture to watch.",1504742400,,181,4.352941176470588
8170492,4,B000005XVL,"Well-acted,with some degree of tension. Great performance by Judy Davis, as always. The subject of politics, however, is not to everyone's taste, and there is nothing glamorous about the rise of fascism at that time.",1504742400,,216,5.2
8170493,1,B000005XVL,"Pointless, boring.  Some people are empty headed, have feathers for brains, and then make a movie.  This is one of them from some of them.
Has anyone noticed that all the movies are posted with 5 stars but there isn't a review?  And if there is it's taken from the writing on the DVD case.  I wonder if this practice is done with all reviews of all of Amz.'s things?",1504396800,,366,4.185714285714286
8170494,5,B000005XVL,"It was a great movie in that it was partially true.  I didn't know a thing about the author D. H. Lawrence and this movie was a crash course in his life.  I did Google his name after the movie to find out more stuff....buried in NM.  Well, back to the movie.  Judy Davis and Colin Friels did a wonderful job in their roles.  Love the swimming in the ocean and loving making on the beach....Mr. Lawrence would have too. The filmography was beautiful in the countryside and the ocean scene....and the riot with the horses.  The music was good.  I am glad I watched it.",1503532800,5,566,4.283018867924528
8170495,5,B000005XVL,"Judy Davis is such a great actress - and in this movie her part 'stole the show'  - Colin (her real life hubby too) played a
great Brit - I'm sure the whole experience of  D H Lawrence in Australia, during this period of time would have been a BIG culture shock for them both!!",1391817600,,277,4.0181818181818185
