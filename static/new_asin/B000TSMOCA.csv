8210621,5,B000TSMOCA,"This is the 4th Noddy DVD we have purchased.  Our son, who is almost 3, loves them.  Each story teaches a nice lesson in a gentle, non-scary way.  We love to sit with him and watch a Noddy DVD with him.  They are very toddler/kid friendly.  The music and little songs in each episode are cute as well as the ""words in a different language"" pieces.  Great buy!!",1205020800,3,360,4.220588235294118
