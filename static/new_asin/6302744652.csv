In this episode of Next Generation; Picard deals with a dependent culture on drugs.  The Ornarans and the Bekkians.  The Ornarans are the dependents and the Bekkians produce the ""cure"" for a disease that has left the Ornaran planet long ago.  The only dramatic sequence was when Merritt Butrick's character, ""T'Jon"" threatens to zap Riker with the electrical powers he possesses.  If he doesn't get his dose of the Felicium it's over for our favorite first officer.  Other than that there is a struggle between both worlds who depend on the other for survival.
It's one of those episodes that you can live without unless you want to see Merrrit Butrick in a role other than Kirk's son.  Judson Scott, from the Wrath of Khan makes and appearance here as the Bekkian leader.",982281600,,834,4.879432624113475
7830488,4,6302744652,This often overlooked and underrated gem is one of my favorite episodes from Season 1 of the Next Generation.  In most episodes the Prime Directive is used as a stumbling block.  Here we see how important the Prime  Directive really is.  Look for guest spots by Star Trek II's Merritt  Butrick (Kirk's son David) and Judson Scott (One of Khan's followers).  Also this is the last episode filmed with Denise Crosby (Skin of Evil was  actually filmed before this episode).  Look for her wave at the end as  Picard and Crusher exit the Cargo Bay.  A really interesting and cleverly  written episode.,955670400,12,596,4.745098039215686
