8052215,1,B0007UZMYM,"Judging by the clothes and vehicles featured, this was filmed in the 1970's.  (Think short gym shorts and tube socks).  Some of the quality in the different categories was so bad you couldn't understand what the narrator was saying.  Very poor quality video.  A total waste of money.",1187913600,,283,4.833333333333333
8052216,3,B0007UZMYM,The four part DVD is quite good especially the South Germany and Romantic Road videos. The Bavarian Forest sound quality is however quite poor.,1187740800,,143,5.0
