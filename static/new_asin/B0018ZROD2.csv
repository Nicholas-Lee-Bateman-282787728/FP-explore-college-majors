On the positive side are the production values - many lucha DVDs have bad sound or bad editing/photography but this one is mainly good. There's also a lot of well-known talent here from Dark Angel and Amapola to Dos Caras Jr (better known today as Alberto Del Rio in the WWE). The Main Event here is a six-man battle featuring L.A. Park, Dr. Wagner Jr, and Shocker against Tijuana's very own Rey Misterio Sr, Damien 666, and Halloween. So, the fights are definitely watchable.

The only problem with most of the matches is that they are not very memorable. The six-man match takes place mainly outside the ring and the camera crew doesn't catch most of it. To make it worse, the Main Event is a one fall match rather than the Dos a Tres Caidas that we usually get in Mexican wrestling so it feels like a bit of a cheat. While we're talking about cheating, I don't mind it at all when rudos break the rules but it's a real drag when they repeatedly win and aren't disqualified and that's what seems to happen here more than once. Most of the wrestlers here are on the larger side, so you're not going to see many of the highflying moves associated with the cruiserweights (except from the ladies' match), which is going to disappoint anyone who is hoping that Rey Misterio Sr's style is similar to his famous nephew's.

Still, the Dark Angel vs Amapola match and the fight between Dos Caras and Dos Caras Jr vs Canek and Canek Jr are both fun matches to watch. And Damien 666's backstage interview is funny if you understand Spanish, especially since Halloween looks bored to tears while sitting next to his longtime tag team partner. I'm not going to recommend this as a must-see, but I've seen far worse elsewhere. If you're looking for better fights with many of the same luchadors, seek out the three volumes of WWA shows instead.",1345248000,,1989,4.537604456824512
8271476,1,B0018ZROD2,"I received the video right away as promised. The only problem is that the video would freeze on the fourth match and that was very frustrating. I tried it in a different dvd player and it did the same thing. I asked if I could get a better video, but never received an answer from the seller.",1331856000,,292,4.140350877192983
8271477,2,B0018ZROD2,"After playing some AAA Lucha Libre game on Xbox 360 and knowing a little background about Lucha in general, I decided to pick this up for a few dollars shipped.

The announcers are extremely annoying, and not because I don't understand a lick of Spanish. They just tend to scream a lot and are very loud and agitating.

All of the matches were slow paced with missed spots and overweight older fathers with their sons or person they passed the torch to. The female match was also pretty bad with no great or even good moves to speak of. Anytime I've ever seen any lucha I had seen fast paced cruiser weights who are light on their feet and have a ton of momentum.

These matches are all opposite of what I believe is common lucha, each match was slow paced and lacked any good moves or even finishers. I was excited to see L.A. Park again, and really enjoy Dr. Wagner. But even the Dr. couldn't make this dvd any good.

Matches: D- (a few decent wrestlers, but still bad matches overall)
Video: C (OK for a dvd, not bad or great just down the middle)
Audio: D- (Very loud and irritating)
Length: B (It clocks in at a little over two hours, but I doubt you will make it through the whole dvd)
Overall: D- (very disappointed in this release, even the trailers before the matches are better then these matches themselves.",1327017600,,1318,4.389344262295082
