8303852,1,B001G55JDQ,"I fell asleep...but i am SO SORRY that i did. This was the most hilarious piece of crap. The only talent anyone appeared to have is mopping the floor (and even that was done poorly).  Horrible, HORRIBLE movie. Its one of those things where the first 20 minutes are filled with ""what the heck?"" the next 20 are filled with laughter and more ""what the heck?"", and the remaining time is filled with snoring. I am so so very sorry i paid a dollar to watch this thing. I can't even begin to imagine the types of favors people had to do to even get this on DVD, let alone in the redbox-which is where i rented it. THANK HEAVEN i didn't purchase it.",1258675200,,642,4.17741935483871
8303853,1,B001G55JDQ,"This has got to rank as the worst movie I ever saw! Very bad acting from the start that gets worse as it goes along, no plot, and a totally ridiculous theme. I agree with the other commenter who said, ""don't waste your money"", and think that the person who gave this movie 5 stars in their review must work for the producer or be related to someone in the movie. I am glad I only spent $1 to rent this, but it was 100 pennies too much!",1249603200,,435,3.9545454545454546
8303854,1,B001G55JDQ,"Are you kidding me? This movie is horrible! First of all, it does not even have a plot and the acting is terrible! Please don't even waste your time or money renting or buying this movie.  You will be totally lost on where the ""hustler"" part comes in until the end.  It just doesn't make any sense at all!  A positive note is that it does have a catchy title, but they should have put more effort and creativity into the film.",1249257600,,426,4.170731707317073
8303855,1,B001G55JDQ,"I just finished watching this movie.  It is slow, yes, but it also lacks any REAL plot line, PERIOD.  The actors lack skill except for the lead Jasmine who may have potential with time.  The scenes did not connect and were extremely choppy.  It is my strong opinion that the other reviews MUST be connected to the producer/writer/actors in order to give any kind of positive review.  This movie is truly sacrilegious, blasphemous, and disrespectful to the Church and God.  I am not a ""holy roller"" but feel that there should be some things that are respected and not mocked.  If they were trying to convey a concept, it was VERY poorly done.",1230076800,,641,4.619469026548672
