1895259,5,B00009XN2Y,"The Judas Priest documentary the other reviewer mentioned is Heavy Metal Parking Lot by Jeff Krulik. It's not available on Amazon, or any mass market vendor, unfortunately, but you can read about it, and about his other films, at his website. (Google 'Krulik') I recommend the 'Krulik and Friends' compilation tape, if you can find it. Both Chris Smith films and Krulik's films are documentaries with offbeat humor and a collection of oddball people as subjects, which are treated with love in the final analysis, though you may laugh AT them at first (like Mark and Mike in American Movie). People who enjoy one would likely enjoy the other, I think.",1083628800,2,651,4.873873873873874
1895260,2,B00009XN2Y,"Having watched Chris Smith's AMERICAN MOVIE I was an instant fan of this guys work, The way he really spent time with the Borchardt's and how he caputured the families love and gripes with each other made me really connect and feel for them.
so when this documentry on people who live in weird homes came out on DVD I was more than excited to watch it. I couldn't have been more disapointed in what I saw. The five people he interviewed were really not that far off base, meaning they where somewhat normal, and there houses, though very different than what you or I probably grew up in weren't all that interesting nor were the houses totally out in the bizaro world.
I was also disapointed in the lack of time Chris spent with them. Unless these people wore the same exact thing everyday Chris only spent one day at each house and we the viewer hardly gets to know or connect with them, espicially how this documentry was set up weaving in and out of each story in five minute increments. The documentry was only 65 minutes long and to have 5 different houses to work with, there was a lot of potential for something really special. Chris showed he put very litte effort in this project.",1076284800,4,1189,4.433789954337899

The whole theater was laughing, and I must say that it was one of the most charming movies we've ever seen. Now, we're avid fans of Chris Smith, and are awaiting his next film.",1061337600,6,251,4.142857142857143

7993907,1,B00009XN2Y,"I honestly don't know how this movie has such gold ratings. Every single thing that happened was so predictable. Yet another horror movie where the bad things are only possible, because the protagonists lack even the slightest amount of common sense. Would rate 0 stars if possible.",1497052800,,282,5.0212765957446805

7993909,1,B00009XN2Y,For me this was the found footage horror movie. Which is a shower fart. Contrived reasons for filming. Lack of back story. Lack of current story. Lack of closure to story. Awful acting. This was has zero effects. Its all around defecate. Even for found footage. When will production companies learn? It only works with ghost hunting stories. Even then its a fail 90% of the time.,1473465600,,379,4.6716417910447765

I had a copy of it I recorded from tv on a VHS tape and it no longer plays so I had to find this movie.
Hard to find title, worth every penny.",1446681600,,295,3.774193548387097

That said, if you only rent one film this year, rent ""Slumdog Millionaire""... if you rent two films this year... rent ""Home Movie""..!",1235779200,,278,4.450980392156863
7993914,5,B00009XN2Y,"""Home Movie"" is an entertaining and comical investigation of strange people and their strange homes. The reality of these individuals creates magnetic tales of how they came to be strange enough to be included in this film. I recommend this film to avid fans of obscure journeys into the lives of those that would be happy not to have as your neighbor.",1227571200,,352,4.693548387096774
7993915,5,B00009XN2Y,"My husband and I watched this movie for the first time last night. He always picks on me about bringing home ""weird movies"", though he actually seemed to enjoy this one along with me. We both agreed we liked the nuclear missile home the best, but would love to know and visit the Alligator guy as a friend.

I am fascinated with those that are just a bit ""off"". Not weird, not crazy... just those that live their life just doing their own thing no matter what anyone ""normal"" would think. These people are doing just that and happily ;  proudly showing off their creations of ""home"".

I agree that this film was much too short to let us really get to know these homeowners, and there didn't really seem to be any obvious direction as to what unheard questions these people were answering.

Overall, I still enjoyed this movie very much. It makes me happy to see there are people who live their lives simply and happily in their own way. =c)",1137110400,,940,4.416184971098266
