8022375,2,B000255LP2,"This is not a review of this specific title, but rather of Warner Brothers' ""TV Premiere DVD"" series as a whole.  I would like to make you aware of my issues with features that are apparently prevalent in ALL of the titles in this series, based upon my purchase of one of these titles (""The Flintstones - The Flintstone Flyer"").

Although the list of issues below was written specifically for The Flintstones DVD, I highly suspect that most (if not all) of it applies to this and all of the other titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series.  Be sure to check out The Flintstones page to see the photos that I uploaded which better illustrate the packaging and disc printing issues mentioned below.

-- The disc does not come in a plastic case, but rather in a cardboard sleeve which opens on the side.  I've purchased $1 public domain DVDs from no-name companies that came in plastic slim cases, so it's appalling that a $6 DVD from a big-name company would be done so cheaply.  Also, the sleeve has a hole at the top in the center where the peg would go for it to be hung on a rack like an action figure or toy.  The hole has been edited out of the promo photos that Warner Bros. gave Amazon to display for the DVDs.

-- The text on the disc is very faint and hard to read - another way Warner Bros. skimped on production costs.

-- The cheapness doesn't stop at the packaging.  The DVD does not contain a menu, not even a plain one.  Because of this, there's an interesting glitch that happens if you let the DVD play past the episode.  You see, after the episode plays, it goes to a FBI Warning on title 3, which then goes to the non-existent menu, so the player just hangs on a black screen.

-- They were even cheap in the placement of the chapters marks, which are placed every ten minutes (0:00, 10:00, and 20:00) no matter if it makes sense in the episode content for one to be there or not.

-- From what I've read, most (if not all) of the titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series were originally released on VHS and/or laserdisc, with these DVDs being done from the VHS and laserdisc masters.  The quality of The Flintstones DVD definitely appears to be better than VHS, so either it came from a laserdisc master, or not all of the titles were done from old home video masters.

Although at first I didn't mind paying $6 for one 26 minute Flintstones episode, that was before I knew that the DVD didn't even come in a plastic case.  Now that six dollars really seems like a rip-off.
