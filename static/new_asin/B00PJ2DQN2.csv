They breezed to a 20 point victory.  How did I afford a ticket?  My goodness, it must have cost 15 bucks!.  This video gives me chills every time I watch.

8688218,5,B00PJ2DQN2,"One crucial, often overlooked key to the Knicks' NBA title success was the way Earl Monroe blended into the team's offensive and defensive scheme. He terrorized the Knicks when he was starring for the Baltimore Bullets, but when he came to N.Y., he quickly recognized the different role he had to play, and he played that role beautifully. Clyde and Pearl were an ideal backcourt, the best in Knicks' history.",1457568000,2,409,4.857142857142857
