2072422,5,B00029NM4K,"I've seen bad movies in my life and time.  I mean really bad stinkers.  Some movies you love because they are bad, some movies you want to slam your head against the wall (in comparison to having to watch the movie again).  After watching Massacre in Dinosaur Valley and then watching the interview with Michael Sopkiw, I have to say this is a true jewel of a movie--the movie is bad in all the good ways.  The action hero of this film, Michael Sopkiw, is someone you enjoy watching moving around, beating the bad guys up, and winning the girls.  The women, mind you, are very lovely indeed.  The story itself is not really there.  I mean really...look at the title of the movie.  You watch this kind of film for the pure mindnumbing adventure that leaves you wanting to watch it again and again.  The movie itself has a bit of everything.  Not really a ""Cannibal Inferno"" like the label on the DVD case speaks of, I'd say the ""cannibal"" portion is ... ah...maybe twenty or so minutes (give or take).  The movie is really a bit of vignettes--one small story after the next wrapped around a plane crash and a need to get out of the jungles.  All in all, I really think that if you enjoy really bad adventure movies, if you are the kind of chap or lass who enjoys watching goofy t&a, good fight scenes where the good guy pulls off the fight against the bad guys at the very end, then you'll enjoy watching this Michael Sopkiw film.",1152316800,14,1429,4.371212121212121
2072423,1,B00029NM4K,"MASSACRE IN DINOSAUR VALLEY IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK. WELL OKAY MAYBE IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK, HOWEVER ON THE BACK OF THE DVD IT GAVE YOU THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS A CANNIBAL MOVIE THEY ALSO GAVE YOU THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS AN ACTION MOVIE,CRAP!!!!  THE MOVIE CONTAINED NO GORE NO STORY NO ACTION AND JUST PLAIN DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE THE MOVIE IS ABOUT SOME IDIOT'S THAT CRASHED LANDED IN SOME CURSED VALLEY (WHY THE VALLEY IS CURSED I HAVE NO IDEA)THEN THEY START TO RUN FROM SOME NOISE ALL OVER THE JUNGLE THEN SOME JERK START RELIVING THE GLORY DAYS BACK IN THE WAR STARTED KILLING AND PUSHING EVERYONE AROUND.TWO GIRLS GOT CAPTURED (WHAT,S LEFT OF THEM) THEN WAS RESCUED BY AN INDIANA JONES WANNBEE.THEY  FINALY MADE IT AWAY FROM THE CANNIBALS (WHICH BY THE WAY THEY LOOK LIKE A POOR MAN,S CANNIBALS) ONLY TO BE CAPTURED BY SLAVE TRADERS (THIS IS WHAT THE MOVIE IS TRULY ABOUT) AND IT GETS EVEN DUMBER.

2072424,3,B00029NM4K,"Massacre in Dino Valley is a special blend of the cannibal and boy's adventure (?!?) genres that shouldn't be missed by fans of Italian exploitation.  It's lighter in the gore department than most spaghetti cannibal shockers (and thankfully there's no real life animal mutilation), but it pours on the sex and nudity.  We have several rapes (one of which is a nasty lesbian rape that seems pulled straight out of a WIP movie) and a fifteen minute or so stretch when the two main actresses simply stop wearing clothes--that's right, they parade around the jungle nekkid!!!  They even paddle around in a canoe with leading man Michael Sopkiw while topless.  There's also a crazed Vietnam vet who looks like a poor man's Bo Svenson.  There's also a visual Django reference, one goofy fight scene with absurd sound effects, one crazy Italian-style brawl that looks as if it were choreographed by blind midgets, and lots of shooting--and Sopkiw has a sawed-off pump shotgun that looks really fly.  Worth owning.",1095724800,26,1006,4.958333333333333
8024771,4,B00029NM4K,"Exploitation horror jungle adventure film of usual Italian level charm, & sophistication.  Very low budget and B or even C level acting but that is to be expected.

  The plot is dreadful, plane crashes into the jungle and then they run into savages and creatures.  This particular group of cannibals seem to love ripping attractive young women's clothes off, and offering them to their sinister Dinosaur Gods (what else would people living in the jungles of what I guess is Brazil do?)

 The guy is sort of a rip off of Indiana Jones, and takes on both the criminals and the cannibals saving the gorgeous ladies in the process.

  I am not opposed to films like this, and like every other guy love pretty girls and a lot of T&A, but even I ask for a basically level headed believable plot with better acting and much better stunts than this turkey.  I will give it four stars only because it satisfies the male's most basic common denominator's entertainment needs, but this one is something you hide in the attic when the mother in law visit's!",1421971200,,1046,4.6
8024772,3,B00029NM4K,"I happen to like the guy and he seems pretty cool off camera. The movie is total cheese. No cannibals munching out and there make up is laughable. Only 2 very light gore scenes. Anyway,if you decide to purchase. Don`t pay the rape price. The movie should not be over $10 for what it is. Good luck!",1401408000,,297,4.228070175438597
8024773,3,B00029NM4K,I would recommend it to everyone. The video is not real clear but not to bad. the audio is just fine,1366243200,,100,3.8095238095238093
8024774,4,B00029NM4K,"My purpose here is to provide a few hints so readers get a descent idea of what to expect from this film. First of all, the film is a simple adventure of survival by a group of men and women, some of which took a flight as they were interested in visiting a forbidden or restricted reserve in the Brazilean jungle. The place was supposed to contain dinosaur fossils and prints. Most of the film takes place after the airplane crushes and survivors have to run for their lives to return to civilization. The film is a typical example of B Italian films of that era (early to mid 1980s), with good and bad guys, good amounts of violence, naked women, and some gore. Now, the film indeed is more about escaping a tribe of cannibals and then a smuggler operating an emerald mine on slavery than a typical cannibal film. Still, you will get one gory cannibalistic scene. Thus, those seeking for stronger, more violent, gorier cannibalistic films will be dissapointed. In my view, the film is entertaining and will be enjoyed by those liking these Italian flicks. Technically, the movie transfer is crisp clear and comes on a nice widescreen presentation. Audio is in English (dubbed) and no subtitles are provided. Extras also include two nice enterviews with Director Michelle Massimo Tarantini, and with American actor Michael Sopkiw.

One note about release titles and total running time: Vipco released this movie in the UK under the title ""Cannibal Ferox II"" (the only resemblance to Umberto Lenzi' Cannibal Ferox!!) that runs for about 80 min. The back cover of this ""Massacre in Dinosaur Valley"" release runs over 88 min, yet not by the 98 min informed on the back cover. Now, if you watch the deleted scenes on the extras, these run together for a bit over 10 minutes. I guess that could explain the difference. Still, this version seems more complete than Vipco's.",1329609600,,1868,4.747692307692308
8024775,5,B00029NM4K,"So a bunch of city twits, a crazed vietnam vet, and a badass anthropologist toting a shotgun crash land into a supposedly cursed jungle. Several scenes of cheesy b movie banter and action, the group is picked off by the local natives who capture the two hot chicks, and strip them naked in an erotic ceremony, before laying them upon an altar of sacrifice. In the fashion of Bruce Campbell and Reb Brown, our anthropologist leaps into action blasting the crap out of the natives with his shotgun in a daring rescue.

Later he and the ladies run into sadistic slave traders which leads to yet another epic gun fight.

Gun fights, primitive jungle eroticism, silly one-liners, explosions, this movie has it all. The movie is more of a throw back to the really old adventure serials, like the ones Indiana Jones was based on. The production value is pretty good too. The shots are crisp and clear, and the costume designs compliment the movie just fine. Another fine touch I gotta add were the natives themselves. Most of them looked like authentic amazonian natives (and some of them looked white guys painted brown).

This is a fun low budget action movie on par with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. If you liked Man From Deep River or any of the Italian Cannibal Mondo movies you MUST add this to your collection.",1288051200,2,1319,4.628205128205129
8024776,3,B00029NM4K,"Director Michele Massimo Tarantini's, Massacre in Dinosaur Valley (Nudo e Selvaggio) (1985), is a quirky, B-movie, jungle adventure, set in Brazil, with fierce natives, beautiful women, gratuitous nudity, violence and gore, evil miners, some humor, and a couple of exciting action sequences.

Kevin Hall (Michael Sopkiw) collects fossilized dinosaur bones, and wrangles his way on a fight headed for the Valley of the Dinosaur, hoping to find some new samples.  Among the passengers is a prominent paleontologist, and his gorgeous daughter Eva (Suzane Carvalho).  Tragedy strikes when the plane crashes, killing the professor and several others.  Deep in the jungle, with unfriendly natives closing in, the survivors head out in an attempt to get back to civilization.

Temperamental piranhas strike, then the natives arrive, capturing Eva and Belinda (Susie Hahn), a model, who is destined for some brutal abuse.  The women are taken to the natives' settlement, but Kevin breaks up their ritualistic ceremony, opening up on the warriors with a shotgun.  Hall and the two women, manage to escape taking a canoe down a river.  Trailing them on shore, the natives nearly succeed in trapping them.

After the well done sequences in the native village, it is mostly downhill, as the unfortunate survivors run into a group of shady miners, with a degenerate scumbag for a leader.  The women are cruelly abused, and Belinda is callously executed, but instead of getting deadly serious, the tone of the film gets lighter, as Hall brings gratuitous mayhem to the miner's camp, and the adventure ends on a happy note.

According to IMDB this was Susie Hahn's second, and last film.  Suzane Carvalho, left films in 1989 to pursue auto racing, becoming a champion Formula 3 driver in Brazil.  Michael Sopkiw takes part in a commentary track, with some unidentified parties.  Other extras include some deleted scenes, and a subtitled interview with Michele Massimo Tarantini.  Very exploitive and trashy, but still entertaining, the film is also available as part of the budget priced Jungle Horrors Triple Feature, which includes the films Jungle Holocaust, and Eaten Alive.",1249257600,,2163,5.247093023255814
8024777,1,B00029NM4K,"This is the second movie of this genre I have purchased on a very misguided whim (the other being the utterly repellant 'Cannibal Holocaust') and my advice is not to waste your money. I cannot think of one redeeming feature about these movies.  They are terribly acted, terribly scripted, hopelessly photographed, lamentably edited, and with only unpleasant themes abounding, mysogynism being the standout characteristic - violence against women seems to be the key element to this entire genre and the storylines are a very weak attempt to dress them up as something remotely worthy or remotely sophisticated.  No doubt some porn films are less degrading to women (though I say that with a great degree of skepticism) and with probably slightly better acting and soundtrack.  You would have to tie me to a chair, starve me for a week and pay me quite a lot of money to watch this 'film' again.  Giving such rubbish the honour of a genre and a place in cinematic history is a bit of a stretch.  I am not advocating censorship, but our cultures would be better just to forget this period in film ever existed and let the corpses of these films rest in peace forever.",1246147200,,1165,4.719211822660099
8024778,3,B00029NM4K,"If your a fan of foreign cannibal exploitation horror than you may very well enjoy this movie. This ""Massacre in Dinosaur Valley"" was also known as ""Cannibal Ferrox 2"". It is actually alot better than ""Cannibal Ferrox"" but not quite as good as ""Cannibal Holocaust"". It is, of course, poorly dubbed and poorly acted as are most movies of this genre. And it suffers from poor pacing. However, it offers up plenty of cheesy gore, a very cheesy male lead, and plenty of wanton violence and nudity. It also offers the 3 sexiest female leads ever seen in any cannibal movie. Suzane Carvalho in particular is a real treat. Its no wonder the cannibals and perverts of Dinosaur Island can't keep their hands off her..",1196035200,9,708,4.672
8024779,4,B00029NM4K,"I got this flick as part of a three-pack and wasn't sure what to expect.  What a pleasant surprise!  Suzanne Carvalho running around in the jungle topless, bondage, kinkiness, girls in peril, fisticuffs, explosions, shooting, Suzanne Carvalho, smart-aleck humor, and Suzanne Carvalho.  Too bad she didn't make more flicks.",1181606400,7,322,5.530612244897959
8024780,5,B00029NM4K,"As with Suzanne Carvalho's other films,this movie is a pure gem. It may be an imported film,but it has a great storyline. The movie tells the tale of a group of people who are interested in visiting Dinosaur Valley,an ancient and  exciting jungle. However,the trip becomes a fight for survival as the plane goes down and the survivors must fight for their lives. The deaths are gruesome and the fights are breathtaking,and the special effects are worth every penny. The characters are great,and the action is exciting. It all leads to a deadly showdown between the final survivors and a group of cannibals who want to offer up the women for sacrifice. Gunshots and arrows clash,and many people are killed. This movie is a great Brazillian hit and you'll love it.",1181520000,8,762,4.816793893129771
