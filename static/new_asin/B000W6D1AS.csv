8221356,5,B000W6D1AS,"I danced Argentine Tango in So Cal at Milongas held in Santa Ana, CA on Sunday evenings in the early 2000's. I concurrently danced American ballroom other week days. I was no great shakes at anything! LOL Got socially passable in both. In Feb/Mar 2003 went to Buenos Aires on a vacation to dance Tango there. Got a pension room and private teacher from connections I made at the aforementioned Sunday milongas. The owners' kids picked me up at the airport. Had a really fun time!
In addition to the historical backdrop and current state, this film gives one a look in and ""feel"" of what the venues are like. Have already watched it twice since receiving it.",1387929600,,657,4.576271186440678
8221357,1,B000W6D1AS,"I was shipped a defective DVD. I bought it as a gift for my Wife's birthday and she can't even watch 5 minutes of it. The picture freezes, and I can't return it since its passed the 30 day window.
I am terribly disappointed! Should have given the money to the SPCA instead.",1212624000,2,273,4.169811320754717

If you love argentine tango, this tells the story.  I recommend it.",1202688000,2,175,3.9714285714285715

Many thanks and....... best wishes for 2008 to you all. Irene HENRIETTE, Brussels",1197849600,,186,4.636363636363637
