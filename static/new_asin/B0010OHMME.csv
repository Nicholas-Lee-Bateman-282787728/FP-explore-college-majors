Im very dissapointed! it was suppose to be a birthday gift forsomeone!",1271030400,,248,4.297872340425532
8322605,2,B0010OHMME,"The video shows little or no fight footage.  The video shows little or no day-to-day ""life of a fighter"" footage.  Its basically the same 6-8 fighters answering these questions:
-as a fighter, can you ever stop learning?
-why is mma hard or cool for you?
-what does it take to be a champion?
The video has terrible production quality... bad sound quality, can't hear some of the dialogue.  I prefer other mma documentaries.",1205107200,5,423,4.767123287671233
