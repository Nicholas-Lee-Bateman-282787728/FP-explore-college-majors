For the majority of movie goers out there westerns made by the Italians in the sixties, affectionately called spaghetti westerns, were limited to the films directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood. But the genre was much bigger than that. While the western genre in the U.S. had dwindled down to mostly TV series and an occasional John Wayne movie, Italy took hold of the genre and made it its own. Its only now, years later, that many have discovered these past works with their emergence on DVD. Thank Arrow Video for offering some of the best and treating these releases like gold.

REQUIESCANT opens with the slaughter of a group of Mexican villagers slaughtered at the hands of ex-Confederate soldier George Bellow Ferguson (Mark Damon) and his men. Among the group is a young boy who receives a head wound that leaves him unconscious but quite alive. Picked up a day or so later by a religious family, he travels with them growing up side by side with their daughter Princy. Of course the two fall in love but as they grow up Princy is attracted to the bright lights, colorful costumes and attention she sees the saloon hall girls getting. She leaves with one of these troupes and Requiescat sets out to find her.

Here is where the story gets a twist of sorts. The now grown up boy chooses the name Requiescant (Lou Castel) and finds himself on the street after a holdup. Picking up the gun of one of the fallen robbers, he accidentally shoots the other two off of their horses. While watching this I wondered if we were going to get a comedy of errors in the mode of the Trinity westerns. Fortunately thats not the case. Requiescant takes the gun for his own and begins to learn how to use it. He continues on his way in search of Princy until he comes to San Antonio, the city where the opening scene took place.

The town is now owned by Ferguson. This includes the local cathouse where Requiescat finds Princy, tossed aside by the dance hall troupe she took off with and forced to work here not to make a living. The innocent Requiescat attempts to reason with Ferguson to get Princys release but the odds of that actually happening are pretty slim. An eventual faceoff between Requiescat and Ferguson with his men is bound to happen. Add to that Requiescat being reminded of where he came from and what happened and a blood feud is sure to erupt.

The movie has all the hallmarks of a spaghetti western with a score filled with the vocals stylings common to the genre. The land is desolate like these westerns were, usually shot in Spain. You can feel the rising dust in your nostril with each footstep taken down a dirt road. The bad guys are bad and the good guys are just.

A number of reviews Ive read about the film discuss the political implications behind the story and the subtle suggestions that were being made in various scenes. Not being aware of most of that I didn't notice it but will do so with subsequent viewings. And thats the thing. I will be watching this again. It was that entertaining that I feel I can watch it again and enjoy it just as much as I did the first time. For me thats a determining factor as to how I rate a movie, is it worth watching more than once or is one time more than enough. For me I feel like I could watch this several times with no problem.

As with all Arrow Video releases they have outdone themselves with this release. Not only do you get a spectacularly clean edition of the film in blu-ray format but the extras, as always seems the case with their releases, are perhaps the best out there. For me they outshine Criterion films with their quality and much more accessible pricing. Included in this release are an all-new 14 minute interview with Lou Castel, a 28 minute archive interview with director Carlo Lizzani, a booklet offering a ton of information and the film in both English and original Italian.

If you enjoy spaghetti westerns then by all means seek this one out. It is one of the better examples of the genre and as I keep saying, Arrow Video has outdone themselves with this release. I know its a keeper on my shelf.",1453334400,,4168,4.475
8720538,5,B00ZPHGVRO,This is a really good entertaining movie. Both Lou Castel and especially Mark Damon are excellent in this. When Mark Damon hit that woman I wanted to knock him out and I love Mark Damon.. now that's acting! Lol. I highly recommend it.,1453075200,,234,4.465116279069767
8720539,4,B00ZPHGVRO,"Very likely, this film ranks among the top non Leone Spaghetti westerns. It has fictitious yet entertaining story, a pretty good sound band, descent actors, and some especial treats. The film was directed in 1967 by Italian Carlo Lizzani. The film clearly goes into the political SW class, which by the way, includes most of these films after 1967-68. That said, two issues make this film especial. First, the political content is more sophisticated than other films like Compaeros (directed by Sergio Corbucci) or Tepepa (directed by Giulio Petroni). Second, the cast includes the great Pier Paolo Pasolini, a left wing icon of Italian cinema from the 1960s and the early 1970s. The well cared dialogs with political substance are clearly the result of a fine tuning collaboration between Pasolini and his friend director in this movie.

The story in this film begins when some Mexican villagers are betrayed by Confederate soldiers led by aristocratic George Ferguson (played by Mark Damon) and they are massacred in front of a walled church. After the massacre, the boy Requiescant (played by Lou Castel) is adopted by the religious Father Jeremy that is traveling with his wife and daughter (Princy). Later, Requiescant quests himself to find and get Princy back after she left her family. During this journey, and after he arrives in San Antonio, he finds the city is owned by Ferguson and his gang, and Princy is kept as white slave in a brothel. From there, the action never stops until the very end. The ending of the film is quite novel and brutal as many other scenes in it.

Technically, this Arrow Blu-ray transfer is really good, the norm of this company in my experience. The image comes in widescreen format, with audios in Italian and English. Subtitles are in English only. The release comes with an interesting interview to current Lou Castel, an archive interview to director Carlo Lizzani, a reversible sleeve cover of the original film, and a collectors color booklet. I bought this movie from Amazon UK, in which the Blu-ray disk comes viewable in A or B players, and cost me nearly half the price of Amazon USA. The movie runs for 107 minutes.",1451260800,,2166,4.883152173913044
8720540,5,B00ZPHGVRO,"Arrow Films, the leading purveyor of classic, cult and foreign films is back with another lost gem from one of my favorite genres - The Spaghetti Western. Requiescant is another film I had never heard of, but much like Day of Anger, soon after viewing moved to the top of my list of favorites of the genre.

Requiescant (which is part of the latin phrase ""Requiescant in Pace"" or Rest in Peace) tells the story of a young Mexican boy who witnesses his village massacred by the rich tyrant George Ferguson (Mark Damon). The boy is taken in by a preacher and his family and grows up with his step sister Princy. When Princy runs off to join a traveling theater, he promises to get her back. He finds Princy, who has become a prostitute, and becomes entangled with her pimps, who just happen to work for Ferguson. After being dubbed Requiescant, he has to use his cunning wits and his expert shooting skills to find a way to exact his revenge.

Requiescant has everything I love about the best Spaghetti Westerns - a quiet hero, a lot of gun play and an actual story. So many Spag Westerns suffer from being boring and Requiescant fortunately kept me interested from start to finish. Lou Castel (who I was familiar with from another classic Spaghetti Western - Damiano Damiani's A Bullet for the General) was perfect as Reqiescant and frequent star of many Italian films Mark Damon was very entertaining as the slightly mad Ferguson. Also included in the cast are famed Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini as a priest and two of his frequent stars Franco Citti and Nino Davoli. I really hope Arrow continues to release Spaghetti Westerns because so far their track record is perfect.

Arrow's release of Requiescant is another well put together, essential Blu Ray/DVD combo featuring a beautiful print and a bevy of extras. Bonus Features include:

-Brand new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negative
-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations
-Optional English and Italian soundtracks in uncompressed PCM mono audio
-Newly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack
-Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrack

-Archive interview with director Carlo Lizzani
-Theatrical Trailer
-Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Gilles Vranckx
-Illustrated collector's booklet containing new writing on the film by Pasquale Iannone",1449532800,,2536,5.074340527577938

Requiescant is an Italian spaghetti western that opens up in a brutal massacre of the Mexican people. Not the film doesnt get much more brutal but the action was good. Now the film is t filled with action but a few shoot outs in between the start and end were we get if shoot outs.

The story was fun and I enjoyed it a lot. A kid who was the only survived saved by God-loving folk and raise him that way. Until He gets his hand on a gun To kill a bad guy and speaks sorry a few times with a prayer to end it. The movie of course is a revenge story but the main lead doesnt know that he u till an hour in when it all comes back to him.

Overall the film was a good watch. Good action and a good story that I feel slows down a tad before the end. The story also has some holes but I would say if you like spaghetti westerns pick this up. It was a good time.

With that said I give this film a 4 out of 5 stars. Good watch, kept me interested and hating the bad guy throughout. Check the trailer, pick it up and of course if you're an Arrow Video film collector you should have it by now.

The Picture Quality is really good looking on Blu-Ray and the same goes for the sound
The Sound Quality is pretty good for an old film for both Italian and English dub. No distortion, dialogue is clear and deep on the English Version which the film was recorded in.
The picture Quality is top-notch shaft detail and colors pop with good look blacks. But at times the quality will degrades on a scene or two during horse back riding near the end also and out of focus face shot but over all the film is 5 star good-looking the majority of the time.",1447718400,,1851,4.448377581120944

THE FILM - [ 3 / 5 ]:

Lou Castel (""Fists in the Pocket"" and ""A Bullet for General) plays a young man who was raised to be a pacifist by a travelling preacher after Confederates massacred his family. But when his step-sister (Barbara Frey) runs away, the pursuit reveals a natural talent as a sharpshooter as well as a bloody and unexpected confrontation with his past. Joining Castel in ""Requiescant"" are Mark Damon (""Black Sabbath"" and ""The Fall of the House of Usher"") as the sadistic aristocratic villain, Franco Citti (Accattone, ""The Godfather"") as his henchman, and great Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (Sal) in a rare acting role as a revolutionary priest.

""Requiescant,"" Latin for ""rest in peace,"" was directed by Carlo Lizzani (""Wake Up and Kill"" and ""The Hills Run Red"") and features a great soundtrack by Riz Ortolani (""Day of Anger"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust"").

No sign of the traditional John Wayne hero character in this film. I've had a fondness for spaghetti westerns for quite some time, primarily thanks to Clint Eastwood. They don't travel the same road as the more typical Hollywood westerns. The bad guys are downright ruthless at times and sometimes the hero is as well. They don't always wait for the villains to turn around and face them like a man, they might just gun them down where they sit, stand or perhaps while they are still in bed.

In ""Requiescant"" our would be hero tries to walk the righteous path and take the high road in life. But if he did that, we wouldn't have much of a movie now would we. Thankfully for the viewer, his step-sister runs off and he runs afoul of some real unsavory men who keep pushing his buttons until they push him too far and our hero turns in to a blazing weapon of revenge.

AUDIO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""Requiescant"" comes with two audio options. There is an English LPCM Mono track as well as an Italian LPCM Mono track. There are also optional English SDH subtitles. The sound quality is very good throughout the film. There was a nice balance between the dialog, score and sound effects and the audio level was very consistent. I did not encounter any problems with the audio such as hissing, pops or dropouts.

VIDEO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""Requiescant"" rides on to Blu-ray thanks to Arrow Video via a brand new high definition 2k restoration from the original camera negative. The film is presented in 1080p with a 1.85 Aspect Ratio. Once again Arrow Video does not disappoint. The film looks brilliant with rich colors and strong black levels. At times, the characters are wearing some very colorful outfits like in scenes that take place in the saloon and the film just looks gorgeous with all the bold colors. The film has a nice sharpness to it throughout and displays a good amount of fine detail in some scenes. There is a thin layer of grain present which looks great. Skin tones have a pleasant, natural appearance as well. Aside from some small white specks that appear sporadically throughout and a very brief glimpse at what may have been a scratch, I did not notice any issues with the video quality of the Blu-ray. This was my first time watching the film, so I feel a bit spoiled that I get to see in high definition.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 2 / 5 ]:

Lou Castel Interview (13:38) - Mr. Castel discusses some of the films in his career, how he learned Italian, and how a political movement in films happened in 1968. (English subtitles)

Carlo Lizzani Interview (27:43) - Mr. Lizzani talks about his early career as a critic and screenwriter. He mentions going through a rough time in film making during the 1950's. Mr. Lizzani discusses working with Dino De Laurentiis on a few films such as ""The Violent Four"" and ""Crazy Joe."" He also talks about the production of the film including the screenplay, securing the funding, some of the cast members and the music by Riz Ortolani. (English subtitles)

IN CONCLUSION:

The Blu-ray looks and sounds terrific. It is a bit light on special features compared to most Arrow Video releases but I imagine it probably isn't too easy to get extras for a release like this due to when and where the film was made. But at least there are two interviews included, with one being brand new for this release. A DVD is also included in this combo pack. I believe spaghetti western fans will enjoy this one. Lou Castel did a good job at playing our hero in the film and making him likable and evoking some sympathy from the audience.

8720543,3,B00ZPHGVRO,"Requiescant is a 1967 Italian Western whose title is Latin for Rest in Peace. Made during the heyday of Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns, this picture never received the attention or acclaim of the Leone films. As a boy, Requiescant is raised by a priest to be a pacifist after Confederates, commanded by sadistic Officer George Bellow Ferguson (Mark Damon, Black Sabbath, The Fall of the House of Usher), massacre his family. It turns out the boy has a natural talent as a sharpshooter. This proficiency will lead to a bloody, unexpected confrontation with his past. Lou Castel (Fists in the Pocket, A Bullet For General) stars as the adult Requiescant, Franco Citti (The Godfather) as Fergusons henchman, and Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (Salo) in a rare acting role as a revolutionary priest. The film is directed by Carlo Lizzani and has a score by Riz Ortolani (Mondo Cane).

Also known as Kill and Prey, the film starts well but soon gets bogged down with its political message. Speeches about aristocrats and the proletarian classes and several scenes used as metaphors for contemporary issues reflect the directors interest in leftist causes. Despite being occasionally longwinded, the film contains all the traditional elements of the spaghetti Western: violence, vengeance, the evil villain, and an often murky sense of morality. The audacity and fearlessness of the screenplay may have served as model for such later Hollywood revenge Westerns as Hang Em High and True Grit.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray release include an illustrated collectors booklet containing new writing on the film; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork; optional English subtitles; archive interview with director Carlo Lizzani; and a new interview with Lou Castel.",1444521600,5,1796,5.298245614035087
