The brother was a corporal in the service, the other brother joins the service and starts as a sarg. Is somewhat of a joke to watch on Memorial Day.",1527379200,,321,4.631578947368421

8679280,2,B00NN20PJ8,"Brilliant Action thriller with Wesley snipes as Neil shaw a CIA operative for the
United nations covert Dirty trick's squad
from the first scene to the last scene nonstop suspense & Action

this film is one of Wesley snipes earlier films from year 2000 and one of his best films aswell
Brilliantly written script by Wayne beach & simon barry and also well Directed by Christian Duguay
the product details on this amazon listing are obviously dead wrong
Christian Duguay Directed the Art of war not the Producer of the film as it's states on the product details
also the Distributor is Warner bros, not Paramount another error on the product details
which does not surprise me
obviously the amazon department that fixes amazon listings do a terrible Job at correcting blu-ray listings
they don't type in the facts of the blu-ray details,
they Just make assumtions the amazon listing department don't bother making an effort in my opinion
unless a customer makes the effort to email the department with an ASIN number to correct the listing
Disgusting really

the original DVD release of this film was back in 2000 now
did have a behind the scenes featurette with interviews with some of the cast and Director Christian Duguay
it was a promo featurette to advertise the film
also the DVD had an Audio commentary by Christian Duguay aswell

well i'm sorry to say that this new blu-ray by warner bros has no new extras at all, has nothing except for Theatrical trailer
not even the Promo featurette or Audio commentary from the dvd release has been carried over
but Warner bros did make an effort with the picture quality & sound quality thou
the picture quality is much better than the old dvd release for sure
so it's more sharper & clearer quality there's still some Grain & Dirt
so the picture quality is not excellent but very Good i guess
widescreen ratio is 2:40:1 as it says on the back cover, product details say the ratio is 1:77:1
which is obviously Dead wrong
the sound quality is 5.1 master audio mix which is of course better audio than the old Dolby mix from the dvd
it's obvious warner bros did a rush Job for this film
no effort with the special features, they didn't even bother carrying over the behind the scenes promo from the dvd
or the Audio commentary which i think is insulting Disgusting effort
but WB did improve the picture quality & sound quality thou
so it's a matter of opinion really either keep the old dvd version or upgrade to this new blu-ray release

the film deserves 4 stars at least
about 1-2 stars for this new blu-ray release based on no new extras no nothing really
but the picture quality & sound quality Definitely has been enhanced",1427328000,2,2673,4.632911392405063
8679281,1,B00NN20PJ8,THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS NOT 1080P AND THE SOUND WAS JUST OKAY . THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS GOOD,1426896000,2,89,4.0
