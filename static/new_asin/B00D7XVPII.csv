8590494,4,B00D7XVPII,"Great series. I read a few critical comments, while agree Magid Hage doesn't go into incredible detail, I think he speaks clearly, repeats his execution and shows multiple angles. I'm a small guy and have had some success with the limited knowledge I have of the choke. My school has alot of big guys and in the two classes since implementing the choke to my open guard , closed guard and half guard, I've been able to tap several of those big guys!",1487808000,,449,4.421686746987952
8590495,3,B00D7XVPII,"Magic Hage shows you how to hit the baseball choke from multiple positions. After watching this DVD and a few of Magid Hage's BJJ matches, it is obvious this is his go to move and he is legitimate in his ability to hit the technique live. However, just because someone can hit the technique seemingly magically, doesn't mean they necessarily know how to teach others how to do it. Magid Hage unfortunately illustrates this point.

He does a good job in teaching the gross motor patterns involved in the baseball choke, but lacks in explaining the finer positioning and movements needed to make it effective. If you are a natural athlete and have the aptitude for grappling, then this DVD might be a worthwhile investment, but for everyone else however, they will find the DVD sorely lacking in instruction.",1454284800,,806,4.798561151079137
8590496,5,B00D7XVPII,Great video... they show you how to hit the baseball choke from so many different positions... I prefer dvds that focus on one choke and show you everything about it...this dvd certainly does that...,1440115200,,199,4.882352941176471
8590497,4,B00D7XVPII,"Overall its a very well put together DVD. Just remember your buying a technique specific DVD. That being said what it does cover, it covers very thoroughly from multiple different angles and ranges of attack. If you're looking to master the Baseball Choke, you will enjoy this DVD.",1420588800,,281,4.875
