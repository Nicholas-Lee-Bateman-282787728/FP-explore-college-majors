8377158,5,B002PNQCCA,"This is a stunning performance perfectly and clearly portraying a voluptuous, sensuous siren of a woman intent only on her own desires, pleasures and self-satisfaction. Right to the very end, her lack of compassion towards her rejected lover is brutal. Her arrogance is so colossal that she is totally oblivious to the impending danger of an act of retribution from the man she has humiliated. Katarina Witt did not have to say a single word. Her body language said it all! She understood the essence of the character perfectly.
And Brian Boitano appears to be such a wimpy character until he is driven mad by ""passion""! He then becomes a raging bull! When he declares his undying love for this goddess of a woman, his performance is heart-breaking and poignant. It transcended the need for words.
Their performances is a tribute to the beautiful, timeless music by Bizet. I am convinced that he would have been over the moon by this interpretation and presentation.",1418342400,2,966,4.896341463414634
