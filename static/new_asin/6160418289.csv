208239,5,6160418289,"This review is of the series, not the dvd. I want to buy it, but $80 is a bit much. If it drops about $30 I am all over it.

Find this somewhere and watch it. Performances are terrific, directing is tight, and the writing is suburb. I think all of the Korean dramas I have watched so far have run on 4-5 episodes too long, but this one was just perfect at 16 episodes

It has the best kissing scene I have seen in years in any venue and the smoldering looks that Ji Sung throws to Hwang Jeong Eun are super erotic. A few times I felt that I had just watched them having sex and all he did was look at her. It is rated PG-13 so the eroticism is all in the acting of the two main characters, especially Ji Sung.

Superb performances by all the secondary characters as well.",1405900800,4,771,3.9935064935064934
208260,5,6160418289,Love it ! Love it!  Two of my favorite actors in a well written and well executed drama. I have watched it three times and now my sister is hooked on it.,1459123200,,153,3.78125
208261,4,6160418289,"I have already watched this drama and I liked it that is why I got the DVD for movie marathon weekend.  The DVD was due to arrive at my home in Ontario, Canada between March 15 and April 1 it arrived on March 1.  I'm happy about that.  The packaging is good.  Each DVD has its own slot.  All that remains to do is watch the disc to see if there is any problem.",1456790400,,360,3.810810810810811
208262,5,6160418289,"Enjoyed the story very much.  It was interesting as well as suspenseful.  Acting was superb.  These Korean dramas are almost addictive.  Many are available for online streaming but I prefer to purchase for future viewing.  With my small collection, I have discovered that there are different versions of these videos (from various countries).  They are packaged differently.  Depending on the distributor, the sets may have multi-layered holders with a section for each disc while others are placed in flimsy cellophane inserts and placed in the plastic holder.  Some have an option on subtitles while others are limited to English.  Based on recent purchases, I have also noticed that some of the less expensive versions have short commercial overlay video clips on the bottom of the screen.  It is not constant but it may be a distraction to some viewers.",1454198400,8,857,5.100719424460432
208263,5,6160418289,"The first time I ever watch Secret Love drama was on KBS, and I ""Love"" it. The chemistry between actor Ji Sung and actress Hwang,Jung Eum  is just excellent which make the drama so well played. I never forgot this drama and wanted to see it again and again. I said to myself why wait for it to be shown again on KBS just buy it, and so I did. Now when I want to see it I can on my own good time.  A great drama and all the Actors played their part well to the top of the hill.",1447977600,4,476,3.702970297029703

i would have given this a 5* but the dvd is poorly formatted. i cannot watch the dvd in it's proper aspect ratio. as a result it plays smaller than my screen in order for me to view it properly",1514419200,,290,3.85
7802733,5,6160418289,"Acting by this cast was truly wonderful.  the lead actors were two of my favorites.  I have seen most of their dramas and for two people apparently not in a relationship, their chemistry is amazing.  most of this drama is very sad, how can one person withstand so much adversity and still be so kind and loving?  You won't be sorry you purchased this one.  As always quality of POH KIM DVD'S is excellent.",1512432000,,405,4.418918918918919
