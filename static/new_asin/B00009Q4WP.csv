7992445,5,B00009Q4WP,This is amazing. It's like having a great DJ come into your house and he puts on 10 videos in a row of some of the best golden era hip hop and starts somehow cutting up the videos while you're watching them! You just can't really find something like that. This is like a rare gem.,1518134400,,280,4.017857142857143

Yes! this DVD not only provide a reason to play, but a reason to keep it playing. Mixed very well by Dj Spinbad. Once played it's adictive flavor set the mood for rollin', reminiscin', and Clubbin'. It's a tribute to Classic Hip Hop, that leaves you wanting more...Hope it is not the 1st of it's kind nor thee last.
