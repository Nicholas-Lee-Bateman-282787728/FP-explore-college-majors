7943949,5,B00005LKL0,This was on a wish list.  It was age appropriate. A great gift.  I would recommend it and would purchase again,1355097600,,110,4.190476190476191
7943950,5,B00005LKL0,"Caillou is a little boy inspired by the events that he is exposed to throughout each day.  He is curious and willing to learn and try what life may present to him.  He explores....which teaches science....and what parent doesn't want their child to explore?  Caillou is an above average boy with a great spirit for learning!  Yes, he does have temper tantrums from time to time; he fusses and whines from time to time as well.  Do you know of any four year old children that NEVER do any of these things?  I would worry tremendously if my child didn't!  Just because Caillou ""acts up"" on occasion doesn't mean that your child will model his behavior.  This might be the perfect opportunity for you to discuss behavioral issues with your child and think about alternative ways to solve a problem or lower their frustration level.  Anyway, have you ever watched ""THE NANNY""?  Now, THOSE are real behavior problems!!!!!!!",1148601600,2,918,4.753164556962025
7943951,1,B00005LKL0,"If this is what you want for your kids, knock yourself out. If they don't whine and complain incessantly now they sure will after a few viewings. Caillou(even his name is irritating) also consistently defies the wishes of his parents and is very disobedient. Great message for young children.",1061683200,6,292,4.979591836734694
7943952,2,B00005LKL0,"This series could be so much better than it is - I have to say Caillou is pretty whiney.  Also - why does he have no hair?  He looks like one of those poor kids w/cancer.  Also - lastly, what kind of name is Caillou?? Anyway, my little three-year old loves Caillou but i wish they would make him less WHINEY.  I love that everything (including the kitchen sink) is in primary colors.",1051401600,5,383,4.205479452054795
7943953,5,B00005LKL0,"... This is such a positive show for kids in the 4 year old range.  Caillou is a wonderful child, with normal tendencies, and loving, guiding parents.  I would highly recommend this video, and all other Caillou videos/shows in the series, to anyone...  Especially those with children around age 4.",1028073600,7,297,4.9
7943954,5,B00005LKL0,This video is about a 4 year old boy and his family and friends. I watch the series as often as I get to. So do my cousins (age 5).  It helps us all solve problems in the real world.,1007164800,4,182,3.55
7943955,5,B00005LKL0,"It is beyond the antics of a 4 year old boy that gets my sons attention. It is colorful, imaginative, sweet, and very real. Caillou has a younger sister and there is much interaction between the two. He gets to explore new places and he shows how his excitment can also lead to some fear of the ""new"" adventure. It teaches that feelings and emotions of fear, joy, etc. are okay and also that you can get over fear to accept new things in his life.
A very rewarding video for children of all ages and gender.",1000252800,8,507,4.237113402061856
