8578881,3,B000MRP1Y6,"The musician/dancer/band leader Jupiter is pretty good, the film is ok, and I happen to like the music. The problem I have with the film is that it displays Jupiter and others in the film as extremely poor, in short as great artists in spite of incredible odds. This is most unfortunate since it's a beaten track. Be aware that the film maker(s) picked the most ""exotifying"" pictures they could find. It actually reminds of similar films about Roma musicians in Romania. Too much mud. Too many instruments made too primitively. Here, for example, a drummer, who makes his own sticks. I think any film should pay more respect to the people in it and show them in their best light, not their worst. And Jupiter and his men play this role, because they know/hope that it sells and it might. You decide! Anyways, if you are into this kind of music, you might still enjoy the film, but I do recommend you to buy their new (2014) album ""Jupiter & Okwess International: Hotel Univers"" INSTEAD. It's not your usual Kongo pop music, rather it's raw and breathes rock music although you may not hear that when you listen to it the first time. I think Damon Albarn is producing some of Jupiter's things or otherwise involved in Jupiter's career and I wonder if he is the white guy in the some of this film's shots.

PS: I should say the film is in French (mostly). Hardly any English and surprisingly: no subtitles of any kind! I don't think that Amazon makes this clear when you're deciding to buy/rent. So beware!",1416009600,,1504,4.549815498154982
8578882,5,B000MRP1Y6,Jupiters Dance is a briliant DVD/CD Film about the lives of musicians in war torn Congo Republic. If you are interested in Africa/African music/Third world problems then this is an excellent film and the CD is equally brilliant !! I had to buy from Amazon USA as could not find it on sale in UK at present. Check it all out on You Tube !,1210204800,2,337,4.2
8578883,4,B000MRP1Y6,"This video is not only a great introduction to the variety of music in Kinshasa, but through its presentation, you see the lives of the people of poorer areas of the city. The film reveals people's perspectives and amazing resilience in this troubled country. After viewing the film, I did a heavy search on the Internet for artists shown in the film, and although I was pleased to see that some have had exposure in Europe, most have not and I could not find recordings (although some have video clips in various places including Utube - mainly the same ones you see in the film). Some of these folks are incredibly inspiring and talented. The focus on Jupiter/Okwess Int'l was disappointing once I began to see short clips from the other artists. These are musicians who need exposure and promotion - would love to see more. Definitely worth seeing this film on numerous fronts. (..and let's hope to hear & see more from the artists!)",1187395200,4,936,4.678787878787879
