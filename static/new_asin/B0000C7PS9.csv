1916097,4,B0000C7PS9,"I got the original series Ultraman sets, out on DVD.  My son, age 4, blasted through those episodes in about a month.  I quite enjoyed them myself, since they brought back found memories of coming home after school and watching Ultraman as a kid.

I was leary of buying these 1990's versions of Ultraman to watch with my kids because they are in Japanese - no dubbing.  No problem, my 7 and 4 year love watching them even without understanding the dialogue.  The plots are pretty basic and formulaic, so my 4 year old gets the gist without beng able to read the subtitles.  Caveat:  A small number of the episodes are a little scary for the 5 and under, so screen them with junior.",1189382400,,681,4.4
1916098,4,B0000C7PS9,"Now I can stop trying to explain to my kids who Ultraman is!
Overall I am quite pleased with this one and my five year old son is enthralled. I do have to complain (mildly) about the lack of an english dub so I wouldn't have to read all the dialog for him. However if the other option is to get the silly chopped up Power Rangers style version they did for Fox then I prefer this one by far(I do hope they do a better job with the extras on the other three sets).
Ultraman was part of my childhood so it is great to see DVD quality material here in the US. Hopefully it will keep coming!",1074643200,11,587,3.9411764705882355
1916099,3,B0000C7PS9,"This DVD collection of the first thirteen episodes of Ultraman is pretty good, but not GREAT. The Video and Audio transfer is good. The special effects are pretty good for a TV show, and I would recommend this DVD to fans of Godzilla-type giant monster action. It's a great substitute for the Godzilla Movies that we cannot get on DVD in the USA, but read my whole review for caveats.
The stories are definitely written for kids, which is kind of a drag because the subtitles can go by pretty quickly, possibly too fast for children to read.  They should have included both a dubbed and subtitled versions on the DVD. (For my tastes I like the original Japanese soundtrack, but it would have been nice to have the option so I could watch this with my nephew.)
The extras are a little light.  There is a spotlight on the GUTS team and Ultraman that is pretty good and in English, however the Monster Gallery only covers half the monters from these first thirteen episodes. The same extras are on both disks. What happened? Did someone forget to put new options on the second disk? Also the 'collectors box' is the cheapest piece of flat cardstock cardboard I have ever seen. It won't last a month! The included t-shirt is size L. Don't bother with the starter set, just get the Tiga part 1 DVD.
The episodes are VERY formulaic. I remember the Ultraman from 30 years ago as being crazy, complicated, full of action, very serialized, and a lot more fun. All these episodes stand alone and have little if anything to do with each other. I was hoping for a more Starblazers-like serialness. There isn't even a two part episode in this batch. VERY disappointing. I will do a lot more research before buying the next volume.
P.S.: If you really like Giant monsters check out the newer ""Gamera Guardian on the Universe"" trilogy best Kaiju ever!",1072915200,2,1836,4.577507598784194
1916100,5,B0000C7PS9,"THis is without a doubt a must get, even for the someone who, casaually likes the show. I mean the japanese version is soooo much better than that dubb stuff you saw on Foxbox. The shirt diffently is a collects item too.
The dvd sound and picture clarity is frightfully good. Almost too good to be true actually. Overall, this is the prize of my dvd collect, and that is saying a heck of a lot since i own over 300 dvds. Cant wait for the next 3 vols to finish it up. Maybe if the dvd says do good. They might do Dyna next. A Ultra series, that in my opionen is better than Tiga.",1071964800,4,579,4.0
1916101,3,B0000C7PS9,"I grew up watching Ultraman and Johnny Socko and his Giant Robot. I was very excited to see a new Ultraman series come along. I have the 2 Ultraman movies on DVD and thought they were good. So why did I give this 3 stars? Because it is still Ultraman. The hero I grew up with and pretended to be fighting rubber monsters and crashing through boxes that were suppose to be buildings. Why I didn't score it higher? I don't speak Japanese. I don't mind a good dubbing or even a bad dubbing for that matter. I simply hate reading subtitles and that is what you get. There is no option to have the stories in English.
The action is cheesy and the story is simple which is what I expected. Monsters are attacking the world and once again, we need the help of Ultraman. The Ultraman of the 60's isn't around and the world relies on Ultraman Tiga who can change into 3 different versions of himself depending on the monster he is fighting. He still has the weakness of only staying in the atmosphere for 3 minutes and the warning light begins to beep signaling that the fight needs to end quickly.
One last thing, if you buy the dvd with the t-shirt, it's a size large which really sucks if you're a XL or greater. Maybe my son will grow into it. If you really like Ultraman and don't mind reading, you might want to rent this and wait for an English version.",1071619200,2,1351,4.260700389105058
1916102,5,B0000C7PS9,"Just got this starter set in the mail, and I'm totally happy!  Ultraman is totally awesome.  The quality of the DVDs are simply fantastic, and you even get a large Ultraman shirt.  This starter set is garunteed to make a fan happy!",1071532800,7,231,4.4523809523809526
1916103,5,B0000C7PS9,"This isn't really a reveiw, but to let people know what this DVD is and share my exictement about this set. This is the first of a four volume set of the original Japanese version of Ultraman Tiga(with subtitles). This is NOT the 4Kids Ent. FOX BOX version shown last year. This is what Ultraman fans in the U.S. have been waiting for! The ""Starter Set"" will have the first 13 episodes in a collecters box and a T-shirt! The ""prophesy"" set will be just the episodes. I hope Ultraman Tiga will set the stage for other Ultraman incarnations, like Ultraman Dyna, Ultraman Gaia, or even the older ones would be welcome! I can't wait...Shoo watt!!",1064102400,36,642,4.543103448275862

7998274,4,B0000C7PS9,I must confess to being shocked to discover that Ultraman series had a lot more entertaining adventures than I thought. I recomment this product to all lovers of Ultraman.,1357516800,,171,4.931034482758621
7998275,1,B0000C7PS9,"While the original appealed to adults and kids, this series seems more directed at kids and younger adults with a younger central cast, but with lazy insipid story lines that don't really integrate the Ultraman character as a person and superhero and loses the charm of the earlier science patrol actors. And though the special effects are marginally better (there was no CGI possible back in the 60s obviously), the effects are inferior and cheap looking by today's standards. As a result, the wacky over the top fun of the monster fights is gone.",1350345600,,548,4.840425531914893
7998276,5,B0000C7PS9,"For those who love the original series there is enough of the old heritage to make them happy.  But for those who want an edgier hero Ultraman Tiga delivers.  This opening of the Tiga series allows the viewers to gain much insight into who Tiga is, why he fights, and interestingly enough - how he fights.  While it's the Japanese version of the show (well sub-titled) there are some extra goodies from the short time it was on FoxBox in the US and they help remind one again of a time when there was more than just copy-cat anime on TV.

This series is a romp, still full of goofy monsters, iffy special effects (mostly involving how aircraft actually manuver in flight, something that has always been a problem with japanese SFX), screwy writing, and one dimenstional characters (but the girl is adorable), the fights are well staged, Tiga follows his own rules well (you'll see), and they fight inside towns more.  This means building-smashing and that is what real kaiju fans live for!

This was a reasonably priced introduction into an Ultraman for the ""future"".  I'd recommend it as a must have for Ultraman ans Kaiju fans.",1310601600,2,1129,4.671717171717172
