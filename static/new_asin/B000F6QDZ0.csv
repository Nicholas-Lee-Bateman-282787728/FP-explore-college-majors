2553322,5,B000F6QDZ0,"My mom purchased command performance by David ten years ago for my dog. I remember how he was before command performance, he would just dart off, not come when called, but just after the first lesson amazing things began to happen. He began to listen, pay attention to me. Well now after ten years I am using it again on my three dogs, 2 chocolate labs and a havanese. My newest lab is 7 months old, but because of the program, he is learning to behave much faster than I ever had with my first dog. I know anyone that has the time and dedication, will find this program to be their best friend to training. If you are tired of a disobedient dog, you have to purchase this program, it will save you millions of heartaches. Thank you David for a simple and easy program to transform a dog truly into man's best friend.",1340323200,2,817,4.27741935483871
2553323,5,B000F6QDZ0,"I ordered this video about 18 years ago when I got a Rat Terrier. This video helped me train him in less than two weeks. He was off lead after the first two weeks of training and stayed off lead for his entire 18 years!!! I do think I had an amazing dog but I also think that David's video made my dog even more amazing!!! I recently had the chance to get a Cavalier King Charles and when I received word that she would be arriving soon I ordered this DVD. I do wish it was updated (the eighties clothing and hair can be distracting) But..and this is important!!! This DVD works!!! In the first 20 minutes working with the dog you get results!!! So if you think the Dog Whisperer is great or you've seen other dog handlers on TV then you need to check out Command Performance. David Dikeman was in this way before the others. He is the man for the job if your dog is more than a handful or just a little inattentive. David has the answers....I just wish he had a show offered to him...or a chance to cut a new DVD.
You won't be sorry for choosing this DVD ...it's well worth the money!!! If your dog is older or just a puppy you can make life a lot safer and easier for both you and your dog by training them with this method!!! Stop dealing with all those ""dog issues"" when company comes, or all the running off to chase a car, or the yanking and pulling walks you dread...get this DVD and you will breath fresh life and love into your relationship with your dog!!!",1299110400,12,1466,4.147368421052631
2553324,5,B000F6QDZ0,"All the other Command Performance Dog Training Systems are in VHS except for this one.  And lets be clear: VHS sucks, and we all know it.  If you want the worlds best selling Dog Training Video why would you want to watch it on the worlds worst format?  This is the only DVD version Available while they last!

The training is amazing--you will literally see results in twenty minutes guaranteed!",1289260800,7,396,4.614285714285714
2553325,5,B000F6QDZ0,"THIS VIDEO IS EASY TO FOLLOW.  I HAVE 2 DOG TRAINING VIDEOS BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, COMMAND PERFORMANCE IS THE MOST SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND, ANYONE CAN TRAIN A DOG WITH THESE VISUAL DIRECTIONS....EXCELLENT.",1180828800,3,209,5.147058823529412
2553336,2,B000F6QDZ0,"I've used David's methods for years with great success.  So when I received a personally signed copy of his award-winning Command Performance system on DVD, I was excited.  That was, until I played the DVDs.  The quality of the recording is horrible!  I mean, I bought a USED VCR to use my 12 year old VCR tapes because the quality was BETTER kind of horrible.  Snowy picture, scan lines, discoloration of the video feed, audio drop-outs.  The disc LOOKS beautiful on the surface, but it seems like someone dubbed a copy of a thrashed VCR tape onto a DVD so every flaw and blemish in the magnetic tape is digitally mastered....so to speak.

I will still use the methods, and I still think the world of David's training methods.  But it's time to pay to have these remastered and reworked to true digital functionality.  I'm not saying it needs to be 1080p, but at least make the picture look like it's an actual picture in 480p.  Sorry, but I was horribly disappointed in this purchase.  NOT for the content, but for the quality.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE remaster these and consider sending out good copies to those of us who have spent good money for a usable disc to be view-able.  I really like David's methods, but I'm embarrassed to show my fellow dog owners any of this video for fear of their initial reaction of David being a sham.  He deserves better than this.  Sorry, but this was a severe disappointment.",1436140800,15,1415,4.581673306772909
2553337,5,B000F6QDZ0,"This program has been passed down in my family for many years.  I have a very smart 5 mon old ""Austiff"" she is sensitive and responds well to the methods.  We are already on Lesson 2. She seems to grasp concepts quickly and this program sets her up for success, she's learned the lesson 1 in half the time, but we kept on the recommended days, don't practice until you get it right; practice until you can't get it wrong. That's our motto and she is doing great!!!  Highly recommend this product, stick with it and your dog will be trained.",1432598400,,540,4.326732673267327
2553338,5,B000F6QDZ0,"As a result of a move, we lost our original tape bought NEW when it first was offered on TV in 1995, Too good to lose so we bought a replacement.  Thanks",1428710400,,153,3.78125
2553339,5,B000F6QDZ0,"I bought the VHS version in 1997 and it was so simple...just common sense really.  And it WORKED!  I trained my 1st two Yellow Labs and it absolutely worked.  Their entire lives (14+ years) they were absolutely obedient.  I never needed a fence or a leash.  When in public I used a leash...but didn't need it.  I once was pet sitting for a week for a friend of mine.  His dog was nuts.  I worked on this dog using David's techniques for a week and it was a different dog.  My friend must have thought I beat his dog because he boarded his dog after that.  The dog's behavior was completely different.

We finally got 2 more Yellow Labs in Oct. 2014 and I went online looking for David Dikeman's Command Performance on DVD.  We had loaned our VHS out and never got it back years ago.  I'm currently using it and it is having the same results.  It WORKS!  The only negative is that it is not HD quality.  But it is great other than that and well worth the money if you want pets with good behavior.",1417132800,,996,4.190476190476191
2553340,5,B000F6QDZ0,"I bought my first tape of Davids' probably about 1995 and I have used this method with several dogs and it works. If you watch David work with any dog & the thing you will notice is that the dogs all pay attention to him and he is not using any treats. That is what made me want to try it. I saw results by the end of first lesson with my doberman & my cattle dog. It is easy to learn for both the pet & the pet owner. I worked with bird dogs as a boy growing up and wish I had been aware of his training methods back then. No yelling at or striking the dog. If you follow his instruction you will end up with a dog that not only minds you but is happy doing it, not afraid of you. Getting your dog to mind can be very frustrating this instructional tape will help you avoid all that frustration. It will teach you how to make your dog look at you & listen to you.",1392940800,,864,3.8055555555555554
2553341,2,B000F6QDZ0,"Sorry but this is very basic stuff in this video. 90% is all about your dog pulling on the leash. So if you don't have that problem, skip it. The other technique are not even effective. This should've been called: Heel Command Mania. lol",1378857600,,237,4.409090909090909
2553342,5,B000F6QDZ0,"David's 1st lesson does so much in getting an immediate result it encourages the user to continue, knowing more positive results will follow.  I've used David's program for years now on my own dogs; German Shepherds and Labrador Retrievers. It's great to have other people recognize how well my dogs listen and behave.  Friends often ask me to watch their dogs while they go away for a day to a week or more. One of the first things I do is introduce my new guest to lesson one.  I've used the 1st lesson with friends pets while pet sitting for as little as a day or two and they all comment on how their dogs do better on a leash after I've watched them for such a short time. I explain how simple David's program is and how it works. Now when friends vacation and leave their pets they affectionately refer to sending them to ""doggy sleep away camp"".
 Regardless of whether traveling in a vehicle, visiting friends and family or just outside for time with your pet, using a program like David's gives you the ability to relax with your pet. Your dog and you will enjoy having a good time working together while they are playing and getting satisfaction pleasing you. I recommend this to my friends and I recommend it to you as well.",1362268800,2,1234,4.422907488986784
2553343,5,B000F6QDZ0,"Program is very effective, with little effort.  Have used this program for many years now and find it to be the most effective for basic obedience.",1362182400,,147,4.653846153846154
2553344,5,B000F6QDZ0,"My husband, Alan, and I have used these techniques for our Vizslas through what is now, decades. David's dog training system continues to be a straightforward, easy-to-accomplish and enjoyable experience for a dog and owner. We have watched these tapes many times and followed them carefully for every young Vizsla that has joined our family. We have even used it for a misbehaving male adult rescue Vizsla and he was soon heeling and paying attention! Our first 'graduate' recently passed away at 17, she traveled with us to Europe to hike in the Alps. A perfect dog. Our 7 year old, 2 Easy, is a canine star. We take her everywhere and the leash is seldom used, only when required by law- she is a dream companion.  We have had dozens of folks approach us about her incredible training and behavior.

My sister recently got a Belgian shepherd puppy and was asking me about how we trained our dogs and David's tapes immediately came to mind. We had a worn out VHS tape but I was able to track down David's website and find the DVD's. I personally liked the 80's version, it is very charming and light-hearted and you are easily convinced that ANY dog can learn from this and will soon be at your side. (I loved the Borzoi!) All of the dogs and David's interactions with them are caring and respectful and the dogs sense that. I absolutely recommend this training to anyone who wants to have a mindful canine companion!",1353974400,,1419,4.582677165354331
2553345,5,B000F6QDZ0,"David Dikeman's program came highly recommended to me and my new puppy by my sister, who has used his training system on three vizsla puppies over the past 20 years!  David simplifies for you the process of training your dog to learn basic and necessary survival skills and manners.  Easy to watch, easy to follow with solid results.  David knows his stuff, is a very likable host, and hey, I kinda like the 80's styles!  I'm looking forward to his next DVD training session!",1353024000,,475,4.619047619047619

8117956,1,B000F6QDZ0,"To meet him in real life, he is really a very horribly rude person, a sarcastic dry person. Very poor ethics, does not care how he talks to people or treats them.  I wouldn't do business with the likes of him.",1504569600,,209,4.097560975609756
8117957,5,B000F6QDZ0,"If you don't know how to train your dog, this is for you.  My 4-month-old Black Lab walks at a heel, sits when I stop, stays when I ask until I release him, and comes running when I call him.  I recently took him to a very crowded outdoor shopping area.  Even though I had his lease at the ready, I never needed it.  He totally ignored all distractions, including people wanting to pet him and stayed with me no matter what I did.  Thank you, Mr. Dikeman.",1500076800,,455,4.125

David is a Fantastic Teacher!!!  I followed his methods and my dog is Perfect With Out A Leash!!!",1493251200,,124,4.391304347826087
8117959,3,B000F6QDZ0,"I used command performance with my pit bull. The video is easy to follow and the training method is very effective. My dog was very well trained using these videos, and it was fun and easy.

I will say that the video quality is as poor as any bootleg dvd you will ever see. The distributors unwillingness to ""re-master"" these videos is laziness pure and simple. If they truly wanted to provide a better product they could.",1473206400,2,422,4.48051948051948
8117960,5,B000F6QDZ0,"Back in the 1997 my father-in-law bought me the VHS tapes of Command Performance. My husband and I had two yellow labs who were 5 years old at the time. Although they were very well behaved we had never been able to teach them how to heel. My father-in-law had seen an informercial on television for David Dikeman's program late at night (pre-internet days) and thought they would be helpful. I thanked him politely for the tapes never thinking they would work. My husband left on a Monday on a week long business trip. I was working out of my home that particular week. I decided to try David's program. When my husband returned on Friday of that same week, I said to him, ""You are not going to believe what I accomplished"". I took him outdoors and showed him how our two labs were heeling. It was amazing. We currently have a 9 year old lab and a 8 month old lab. We continue to used David's training.",1456531200,,903,4.349112426035503
8117961,4,B000F6QDZ0,"First, I owe David Dikeman an apology.  I ordered this product and it took a while before it was sent. After trying to cancel the order, it was sent to me anyways. I contacted David and he indicated that he thought this was the best product out there, and I told him I would be the judge of that.  Because I was frustrated with several things that happened through AMAZON and several of my orders, I got CRASS with David and in a professional manner, rather than strike back, he refunded my money.  I told David that if his product was any good, I would let him know and he could charge my card for the full purchase price.  I don't take things for free when they are of value.  I would give the product 5 stars (and I can update later) except that my dog had surgery and I cannot apply the techniques that David shares in the video.  Having trained a five of my dogs using CLICKER techniques, my current dog does not learn from the method.  He is food driven and if there isn't a food prize, he refuses to comply with direction.  I looked for other methods, and this appears to be the one.  We'll see and update later.

Having reviewed/purchased several products trying to find something that will work on my dog, all have failed so far.  Some tell you to buy spiked collars that simulate a bite to the throat, and they warn you that you should buy a muzzle because the DOG IS GONNA BITE.  David's technique teaches some essentials, the main one is that the dog MUST have eye contact with the owner/controller, and has to learn to obey and that is accomplished by watching what the owner is doing, and not the owner paying attention to what the dog is doing.  The training also doesn't make use of treats, but rewarding the dog by showering praise, which my dog also likes.

Once I can begin the training, next week (2/22), I will come back and tell you how it goes.  In the meantime, I am truly sorry David for my bad attitude.",1455926400,,1929,4.304709141274238
