8329763,5,B001O6ME7G,"I've now seen several gory horror movies by Brian Paulin, two of which I enjoy as much as vintage Lucio Fulci, Inside and even more than Olaf Ittenbach's best pieces (his nasty shot on video gore chambers, Black Past and The Burning Moon, rather than his ambitious, but often dull ""big"" movies).

I hope Mr. Paulin gets his due.

Certainly, the viewer needs to accept certain things that come with a micro budget labor of love like Fetus and undoubtedly some viewers want quickly-edited bloody action movies (28 Days Later and The Descent) rather than atmospheric isolated horror, which is my preference (eg. Rosemary's Baby, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Scarecrows, City of the Living Dead, Inside, Profondo Rosso, The Shout, Lost Highway). I imagine that if this piece (and Bone Sickness) were shot on film in the seventies and rediscovered now, they would be ubiquitously categorized as ""essential cult.""

((I don't have a problem with shot on video stuff (which this is), especially when the compositions and lightning are as thoughtful as they are here and i believe there is a some benefit to the extra visual information you get at 29.97 fps, a different level of reality, even if the image isn't quite as pretty. It's not better than film, but different with it's own quality.))

When comparing Fetus to Paulin's seemingly best known work, Bone Sickness, Fetus is altogether better realized-- the compositions, lighting, acting and effects are of a higher caliber-- but Fetus is less ambitious in terms of its scope. So Fetus is more professional and less flawed than Bone Sickness, but it does not reach as high or sustain its crescendo for nearly as long.  I also appreciate the fact that Fetus is done in a completely serious way, rather than the jokey splatter of Jackson or Evil Dead II or Shaun of the Dead kind of stuff.

The music is strong, and in an older Giallo style, which helps the vibe. There are certainly some moments that confused me-- audio & effects ideas that didn't fully translate-- but this movie and Bone Sickness are the best shot on video horror movies I've seen, and they overachieve in so many departments (inventiveness, craziness, atmosphere, gore, etc.) that all the flaws are easily forgiven.

If you liked Ittenbach's Black Past & The Burning Moon, I recommend Fetus, which is a comparable chamber of gore, though Fetus is better written and photographed and is aided by a very good score.  I look forward to more work by this driven and talented guy.",1384128000,,2489,4.85377358490566

Brian Paulin has discovered the Guinea Pig films, and that, my friends, can only be a good thing. His latest, Fetus, borrows heavily from the franchise (especially Mermaid in a Manhole) while still containing all the things I love about Brian Paulin movies--really cheesy gore effects, incomprehensible but stupidly funny script, and a real sense of earnestness about making a movie that's not good, per se, but highly enjoyable. You know, the stuff Hollywood tries to do without ever actually managing it. Oh, yeah, and some of the best soundtracks in the business. Seriously.

As you can tell from the above, this is really not the kind of thing the casual horror-movie lover, or even the folks who are rabid fans of the slew of bad remakes coming out of Hollywood these days, is going to enjoy. Like most basement-budget indie projects these days, this is a flick made by and for established fans of underground horror and gore films. Michael Bay has nothing to do with Morbid Vision Films. (And, as Captain Peacock was won't to say, ""thank heaven for that"".)

This effort centers around Kevin (played by Paulin himself), a man shattered by the death of his wife Sara (Nette Detroy in her first film role) during the birth of their child. As far as I can tell (I did say this script is incomprehensible, right?), Kevin steals Sara's body from the morgue and goes looking for a resurrection ritual to bring her back. This gets him involved with some very nasty people, and even nastier supernatural beings.

All of this, as you're probably aware if you've seen any of Paulin's other movies (Bone Sickness, Dead Girl on Film, etc.), is really nothing more than a loose framework on which to hang Paulin's plethora of gore effects anyway. And I have to say that as Paulin makes more movies, he gets better and better at gore effects; Bone Sickness was much better, effects-wise, than Dead Girl on Film, and the progression continues here. Some of it still looks cheesy, but I almost suspect that at this point that's by design; the overbright, watery blood could easily be some sort of throwback/homage to giallo rather than something out of the murky world of budget limitations. (After all, a number of the other effects here are really well-done, almost professional-looking.) I also have to mention that I'm pretty well inured to gore effects these days, having cut my teeth on them back in the seventies and having been a rabid fan of the genre for well over a quarter-century now. Paulin, however, always manages a scene or two that squicks me out, and Fetus is no exception. It's one of those scenes (think about Bill Pullman strapped to the chair in The Serpent and the Rainbow, but an order of magnitude more painful to watch) that I'm relatively sure most members of my sex will have problems watching. Be warned.

Given that, and given how much better the effects are here than they are in Bone Sickness (and Paulin was no slouch even then), I'd have to count this a success. That said, the movie still has no end of problems, and a lot of them are the same ones that plague most of the microbudget horror flicks I watch. Specifically, the lighting (much of the film borders on too dark to see) and the sound (the mix is bloody horrendous in a number of scenes, to the point where I wished I had subtitles). But if you like your horror flicks dirtier, nastier, more extreme in their subject matter, and a whole lot bloodier than anything Hollywood's even considered turning out, you'll get as much of a kick as I do out of Brian Paulin's movies. ***",1277251200,2,3588,4.670886075949367
