5003642,4,B006LOBZXK,"Killjoy tells the story of Michael, a reserved high school student, who has always been an outcast among his peers. One day, the bullying goes too far and he endures his final beating. Now a new face is in town, ready to exact Michael's revenge. His name is Killjoy and he thinks murder is a laughing matter. In Killjoy 2, a group of at-risk youth are on their way to the wilderness for some much-need rehabilitation when their van breaks down and they find themselves in the home of a voodoo woman, Killjoy's spirit is summoned and we get more killer clown action. Killjoy 3 has a group of college students accidentally opening the portal to Killjoy's demon realm. Now trapped in Killjoy's strange funhouse world, they must team up to survive and end Killjoy's reign of terror once and for all.

Despite what people have to say about this series, I actually enjoyed the heck out of it. This collection is a definite must-have for fans of Charles Band's features(Full Moon Pictures, Big City Pictures). I guess what I love most about the movies is Killjoy is never the same in every movie(unlike other horror movie icons). Even though he's played by two different actors(Angeles Vargas, Trent Haaga), you never quite know what to expect when watching the movies.",1333584000,13,1262,4.736363636363636
5003643,5,B006LOBZXK,"Part 3 of Killjoy is the only movie in this collection that you will want to watch more than once, but still you really can't beat this deal.

Plus, you really need to see Killjoy 3 first in order to really appreciate Killjoy Goes to Hell, which is the next Killjoy movie installment right after the last of this one, and is totally worth purchasing whether you buy this collection of movies or not.",1408147200,,399,4.391891891891892

5003650,2,B006LOBZXK,"Low budget, corny, poorly developed and genuinely shoddy films are Killjoy 1-3. These films may entertain a thirteen year old, that's the best compliment I can give them.",1391644800,2,170,5.107142857142857
5003651,3,B006LOBZXK,"So I hate to follow everyone else, but the only film worth.....anything...in this set is Killjoy 3.  The first two are filmed on the cheap, filled with horrible acting and terrible special effects.  Killjoy 2 is a vast improvement on clown design, but it surprisingly feels incredibly amateur.  Then there's 3...which is filmed with a higher quality, better plotline, ACTUAL plotline, better acting, and actual backstory.  It's an improvement on all levels, and is actually fun to watch.  It isn't perfect, and the acting isn't amazing either, but if you can pick this up for $1.00 used?  Totally worth it.  I'm a fan of any scary clown film, so I naturally came to this series looking for something on par with Pennywise.  Yeah, didn't get that.  But Killjoy is very entertaining in the 3rd.  I recommend just watching that one. ;)",1380931200,2,832,4.836879432624113

5003654,4,B006LOBZXK,I liked the third killjoy movie. The first & second killjoy movies weren't that great though. I wish I could've found the third one by itself.,1374364800,2,142,4.5
5003655,2,B006LOBZXK,The quality on this release is awful! If I had to compare this to VHS quality I would have to say it does not even stand up to that. The films themselves are also terrible. I only spent $5 on it and I regret it. That should tell you something.,1369440000,2,243,3.88
5003656,3,B006LOBZXK,"Had this not been all 3 movies I would have had to give it a lower rating.  The price for the 3 is ok, the movies themselves, eh.",1363132800,,129,3.607142857142857
5003657,3,B006LOBZXK,I would skip the first 2 movies on this set and watch the last 2. Killjoy is a lot more sadistic and the stories a lot better.,1362268800,,126,3.7037037037037037

5003660,5,B006LOBZXK,"The fact that this was a triple feature got rave reviews from my son.  That they are all only about an hour and 10 mins long also got rave reviews.  A surprise for him, as he is a Horror movie buff and had not heard of this particular series.",1356566400,,242,3.9183673469387754
5003661,2,B006LOBZXK,"""Killjoy 3"" is my favorite of the series. It was sad that they had to make a 1 and 2. Killjoy is a clown that was created in film one during a black magic ceremony. He enjoys killing as the titles suggest and he loves cliche lines.

Shortly after this DVD was released, another DVD was released that had all 3 Killjoy films plus 9 Puppet Master films, making 12 films in all and available at Walmart rather inexpensively. Now I ask you, what would you rather own?",1349654400,,463,4.261363636363637
5003662,4,B006LOBZXK,This movie is more of a comedy then it is a horror movie. The movie came on time and it was in great condition. The movies themselves are not that great.,1346544000,,153,3.967741935483871
