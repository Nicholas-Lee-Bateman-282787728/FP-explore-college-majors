This comedy brings up the problem of unemployment for returning veterans after the war. The rationing of WW II ended, production for civilian needs increased, and employment was available. Unemployed veterans could join the ""52-20 club"" where they received $20 a week for 52 weeks while unemployed. If the minimum wage was about 25 cents an hour you can estimate those fancy restaurant prices. Outdoor movie theaters were a new invention that lowered the costs in providing movie viewing. Since most movie watching was done in the evening it avoided costly unused space. Local movies theaters started to go out of business after television viewing increased in the 1950s. The buildings were turned into stores or torn down.",1363478400,,2681,4.940133037694014
