8524359,4,B00838N41S,"This is one of those films I feel like an idiot for not loving more, since it's been embraced as a masterpiece by just about every critic and film-writer I admire. And I do find it fun, and clever. But - for example - compared with the far more compact Bunuel mini-masterpiece Simon of the Desert, this feels insubstantial, and eventually a little repetitive.

Its an enjoyable entertainment, but it feels like a clever, witty, experiment in surrealism, as opposed to Bunel's more savage and challenging satires with their deeper bite. Of course there are the underlying themes of how shallow the bourgeois and wealthy are,how the rich live going nowhere, with no real moral compass, or reason to go on. But those aren't really new ideas  either in general or for Bunuel

I will happily see it yet again and see if I have a deeper reaction, but for now, for me, it seems like a fun short film expanded to feature length.

The blu-ray is quite a solid transfer.  Not revelatory, but certainly a step up from any DVD I've seen.",1462147200,3,1025,4.579234972677596
