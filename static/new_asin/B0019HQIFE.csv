Stunning use of film - John & the gang never sounded better.

Buy it, you won't be disappointed, and like a reviewer recently said, ""He plays like his life depends on it"".",1214524800,,290,4.333333333333333

3437370,5,B0019HQIFE,"Get the bluray version. I've played this 20 times and I always geek out. Should be obvious that to enjoy this you should have some really good speakers and base and a great amplifier to process all the data. I rave about this bluray whenever someone mentions John Mayer.

And the others that play with him ..... so great, so great!!!  This entire BluRay recording has become a jewel in my collection.  My wife and I had not really heard much of Mayer's music before watching this.  Now, I for one, am a super fan and look forward to buying as much of his stuff as I can.

3437393,5,B0019HQIFE,"This was the concert that finally turned me on to John Mayer.  The second set, the blues set, specifically finally showed me what a musician, and outstanding guitarist John Mayer actually is.  The first set, the acoustic set, while good for an acoustic set, did nothing for me. Then he came out with the blues trio, and I heard John Mayer sing and play guitar like I've never heard him sing and play.  It's light years beyond anything you've ever heard on the radio, and a side of Mayer most people have never heard.  If you don't like Mayer because of his facial contortions, and his whiny voice, then get a copy of this and watch how that 2nd set totally changes your mind about what a giant this guy actually is as a musician. He's so good as a blues guitarist, it'll just blow your mind....",1471219200,2,794,4.380952380952381

3437395,3,B0019HQIFE,"John Mayer... has done a excellent performance in this concert..... that is the reason i gave 3 stars.

There is some flaws into the audio. Despite as the concert is been use 96khz 24 bit dolby tuehd track, the sound engineer and mix really fail to archieve a really balance between the surround effects and sound distribution around the speakers. In fact on the rear speaker you could only feel some delay echo of what ocurring on the front. Instead if split the effects of the guitar and other instruments from the companion players. It's really dissapoint to set your AV to stereo all channel to fill the fullness.

Im really consider a audiophile enthusiast where i owned really high end gear of av separates and external amps. And believe me what im telling you.

Nothing compare to the mastering of sound of others concerts, despite was recording in 48khz 24 bit... really overwhelm and impress every single performance of the instruments. I couldn't leave to mention FAREWELL from eagles... or the MASTER OF JAZZ... which really mark my ears for my rest of my life

I hope John Mayers could in the near future produce and masterpiece of blueray that can match or overpass the current top of the current quality reproduction concerts.",1468108800,,1240,4.780373831775701

3437441,3,B0019HQIFE,"As a non-guitar musician, the guy has serious talent.  Not one-in-a-million talent.  He's no musical genius (if that's even possible) but he has serious talent and I enjoyed the music.  This was my first intro to Mayer.  I'd heard of him of course, but this was my first at-length sampling.  I loved his music, especially the acoustic mini-set, but also the trio.  Different approach that I found a nice compliment to each other.  The video is HORRIBLE.  On two different players it skips and jumps all over the place.  Large sections are unplayable.  That's the reason for the three stars.

As for the non-musical parts of this DVD, gee do we have to watch another talented entertainer strain WAY TOO HARD trying to be mysterious, misunderstood, tormented by his ""genius"" and the frustration of ""his message"" desperately trying to escape the confines of his rarified brain to the simple people called the audience.  Please.  We've seen that tired movie for the last 15 years in Johnny Depp and others.  This guy seems to have some psychological and emotional problems.wants to spend the first hour ""getting you back where you know nothing about him"".  Or he really doesn't like it when everything goes well.  Hmmm.  Enough of the failed attempts at pithy profundity.  Just play the damn guitar.  That's where the magic is.

Back to the music -- Mayer is joined by two other talented musicians for the trio.  The bass player is standing quietly in the background tearing it up.  I'm no bass player either but I'd say his performance rivals Mayer's.  Really enjoyed the music.  The video and behind-the-scenes stuff?  Not so much.",1423958400,4,1629,4.857664233576642

3437447,5,B0019HQIFE,"Again, a gift. But I've seen it several times and it is a great dvd. The way he plays as 3 separate acts and does several different styles is rad.

3437448,5,B0019HQIFE,"This is a great live concert from one of the best musicians of this generation. In this DVD, he performs songs that haven't even been studio recorded. He also puts new spins on his other music. There are three sections of the show, each as its own sort of mini-show. The first is the stripped-down acoustic section. This is followed by his side-project blues band the John Mayer Trio which includes the amazingly talented drummer Steve Jordan (a producer of several of John's albums) and bassist Pino Palladino (now a member of The Who's touring band). The last third of the show features John and his full band. Interspersed among the show is short clips of behind-the-scenes footage.",1421625600,2,685,4.813559322033898

3437463,4,B0019HQIFE,"As has been said in many previous reviews, the audio mix and visuals on this Blu-ray concert are top notch.  Good clarity and definition both visually and audibly. Nice, balanced low end with focused mids and slightly subdued highs. Though I'd prefer a touch less of the vocals in the surrounds.  Mayer is an accomplished guitarist and demonstrates some nice chops.  Prefacing my next comments with ""music is personal and to each their own"" so keep the flames to a minimum - I say that both lyrically and vocally Mr. Mayer does not appeal to me.  Sounding a bit like Dave Matthews (whose vocal style also does not appeal to me) in both the nasal vocal qualities and odd lyrics.  I'd personally be just fine if this performance was purely instrumental.  I like the fact that generally the vocals are less prominent and when listening to the acoustic pieces the vocals can be thought of as a mellow burble allowing an overall relaxing vibe to come through.

In the spoken interludes both in the car and onstage it came across to me like Mr. Mayer was taking his present circumstance, his ""15 minutes of fame"" so to speak, a bit too seriously.  With comments like ""...It would take me an hour at this point to ease someone's mind into knowing nothing about me from thinking they know something about me."" and mentioning that being photographed ""messes with his message"" which is that he appreciates and is thankful for his audience.  The very fact that he has an audience is the reason he is being photographed, so he just needs to accept that fact.  I'm not quite sure how being photographed can mess with the message that he's grateful for his audience anyway...In my opinion this disc would have been better if he simply just didn't open his mouth.  All in all however, the quality and (musical) content of this concert is excellent. - I'd recommend it to any music lover.",1410912000,2,1872,4.642424242424243

3437471,5,B0019HQIFE,"I love this concert DVD, I listen to it all the time on weekends around the house...it's a lot of music, 2 1/2 hours. I have also given this as a gift to several friends because it's just so great! Three distinct sets - all stupendous! I wasn't a huge John Mayer before seeing this because I was largely unfamiliar with his music, other than a few hits. I gained so much respect for him as a guitar player after his second set with the Trio - blues/rock - and they tear it up!!!  Also as a gifted songwriter. Its just beautifully done and laid out, a gem worth owning. I've listened to it a dozen times now and still not tired of it - in part because the 3 sets are all different, yet together make one GREAT concert!",1403568000,,717,4.121428571428571
3437472,5,B0019HQIFE,John mayer fans will love this amazing compilation of popular songs and covers he did live in LA.  Just a great smooth recording.,1402272000,,129,4.608695652173913
3437473,1,B0019HQIFE,"Nothing wrong with the music (I assume)  My copy of the DVD was defective, frequently skipping to the point it wasn't playable.
Returned for refund.",1400544000,,148,4.92
3437474,2,B0019HQIFE,"I would advise not wasting your money on this DVD if you like good video quality and pure live sound. The video is pretty sad, one shouldn't expect Blu-Ray quality in a DVD but come on now, this looked liked old concert footage from the 70-80's. It could be they did that on purpose to try and create a feel or vibe, but if so they over thunk and it failed imo.

The audio was pretty decent. I'm no audiophile as this was played through by ML Motion 12's and not super high end stuff, but I enjoyed it for the most part.

One other complaint, and this goes for many ""live"" audio DVD's/Blu-Rays and applies here as well. PLEASE stop trying to clean up the live audio so it sounds exactly like the studio CD version of the songs! Many times it almost appears as if he is lip syncing the music when we all know he'd never do that. Right when his mouth starts to be a bit off from the words (on account of their messing with the recording) they cut away to a back shot or some other longer distance shot where it's harder to see their stupid attempts to make it sound studio perfect but destroys the ""live"" feel imo.

I'd have to see the Blu-Ray version demo'd before I'd try that. The video may be better but the video/audio match could be just as screwed up and ""live"" performance lame thanks to over production.

As a couple others stated, the between clips of him driving with that silly dog in his lap making comments is a ""meh"" from me. Some comments seem a bit pretentious or come across as a little false humility imo, but I think they're honest and straight forward, they are who he is take it or leave it.

If you're just buying for the audio mostly but want to see him too, and don't really care about the overproduction and poor video quality this DVD will likely fill your needs. But for me it was disappointing.",1400025600,2,1821,4.2514450867052025

3437476,5,B0019HQIFE,"I ordered this mid February but took about two weeks to get it. Definitely worth the wait. If you love John Mayer's music you will love this concert. 3 different sets from acoustic, the john mayer trio and this full band set is just great.

3437484,5,B0019HQIFE,"I wasn't really a huge John Mayer fan until I bought this DVD.  I paid $6.99 for it on here, and it was by far the best concert DVD from a raw musical talent perspective that I have ever bought.  Even though the concert was in 2007, this DVD is awesome.  John does an open acoustic set, then a blues trio, then finishes with his Pop band.  All 3 were fantastic, although surprisingly I think the blues set is the best.  Don't hesitate, buy it.",1392076800,3,443,4.1647058823529415

3437488,5,B0019HQIFE,"This is the  best John Mayer album. It has all of his styles, blues (Trio), soul (acoustic on his own playing the guitar) and Pop/rock with his band and all of his popular songs. Must have it if you like Mayer",1389484800,,209,4.097560975609756

3437494,5,B0019HQIFE,"I bought this blu-ray after seeing a few clips from it on YouTube.  It is seriously my favorite live show of all time.  John Mayer plays three different sets--acoustic, jazz trio, and full band.  The sound quality and video are phenomenal, and it is a fantastic show.  I've seriously found myself watching this about once a week for a couple months.",1380758400,,349,4.672131147540983

3437496,5,B0019HQIFE,"Not really familiar with John Mayers' work, but found this to be extremely pleasing. The Blu-Ray offering is astounding in audio, as well as video. Can't really ask for better. For others considering this disc, but who like me are unfamiliar with JM, he reminded me very much of the late Stevie Ray Vaughn. So if you're a fan of SRV, I'd say you would definately be pleased with John Mayer.",1380585600,,390,4.507042253521127
3437497,5,B0019HQIFE,"John Mayer is incredibly gifted.  This concert shows all of the musical personalities that make up John Mayer: the acoustic side that started his career; the ""rock band"" side that many have come to know and love; and his ""let me see what else I can do and reinvent myself"" side that will keep his career going for a long, long time.  I've always been big fans of Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn,and many amazing guitar players that no one's even heard of.  After seeing this concert ""up close and personal"" (from my living room), I think John Mayer has proven he is very worthy of the accolades he's received in his career.  He really is one of the ""most influential"" musicians of our time.  Buy this!",1380412800,,701,4.488188976377953

The way it was conceived, excellent.
First the artist solo. And as the concert progress, musicians are added to the presentation.
John Mayer give us a demonstration of control, virtuosity and good taste in every song.
He is so good that it doesn't bother me his cockyness.
I give 3.5 stars to the image, but the sound mastering is A plus.
You'll spend well your money if you buy this one.

This DVD (and you can also get this on CD) showcases John's talent and demonstrates why he is so revered by even the greatest blues musicians around (like Clapton, BB King and Buddy Guy).  Although John's studio work is very good, his live performances best demonstrate his abilities.  This is one of the best DVD concerts you can buy....incredible!!!",1377043200,,519,4.875

3437506,4,B0019HQIFE,It would be a better concert if it would have included scenes from concerts in bigger places. There's so many good songs from John Mayer that I missed some of them at the BluRay.,1376352000,,178,4.264705882352941

3437517,5,B0019HQIFE,"Something resonated with the first Mayer song I heard in 2001 No Such Thing. I bought Any Given Thursday DVD when it came out so I have known about his musicianship from early on. I also like jazz so got Try! when it came out. Mayer took all of what he had learned and down not only from 2001 to 2007 but all those years training himself and put together one of the finest concert performances, well in recent history at least.

Even though his personal choices don't seem to match the lyrics of his songs often, he does write touching, moving lyrics and is arguably one of the better songwriters of the last 15 years. I think he is on par with the best guitarists of the last 50 years. And you get him in all his incarnations her: acoustic, jazz trio, and band. I have been to two live shows and this band set up I like best. He had horns the first time I saw him and ditched them the second time. First time was better.

You get some great drumming from Steve Jordan. 'Dayla' his long-time bassist is in the band set. I bought the DVD years ago and the Blu-Ray recently. Blu-ray is very well done. I'd go for that, it is a real treat although the DVD is a great price now. I doubt a single-concert goer that night said well that sucked or I didn't get my money' worth. And neither would anyone getting the Blu-ray. One note on the Blu-ray the Blu-Ray live extra is not supported any longer and on the package it said through 2010.",1370044800,,1432,4.203636363636364

3437520,5,B0019HQIFE,"I've always been a fan of John Mayer and seeing him in this concert is spectacular! You really get a sense of his amazing talent as he plays three different sets. I'm fan of pretty much anything by him, but for those who maybe like the pop more than the acoustic or the trio more than the pop, there is plenty in every one of his sets to enjoy. If you're a BIG fan, definitely buy! But if you're only a casual listener of his music from what you hear on the radio or any other place, then you may want to think about it. He tends to lengthen his songs to add extra bits of guitar playing that are clearly not in the original recordings or radio versions of his songs...and what's more, not all the songs he plays are songs that are played by popular radio, so don't expect the same versions of what you've heard.",1366156800,,812,4.1455696202531644

3437522,5,B0019HQIFE,"John Mayer live is soo much better than any studio recording he has done.  This one in particular is great because you get an acoustic performance, a blues performance from the John Mayer Trio, and a long set of a normal Mayer concert.",1365292800,,235,4.465116279069767
3437523,5,B0019HQIFE,"I actually heard this in the DVD version about 4 years ago and haven't been able to forget it. So I went ahead and got it in the Blu-Ray version. I don't really watch it, I just like listening to it. When he's doing just the acoustics I think it sounds phenom. I really like John Mayer's style and voice it's a very chill type of sound. I really like this and I am glad I finally bought it.",1364169600,,390,3.949367088607595
3437524,5,B0019HQIFE,"Perhaps like many of my generation I tend to view much of today's popular music as relatively shallow and uninteresting with little to add when compared to the output of the fertile period of the late 60's early 70's. Then my son played John Mayer's live acoustic version of ""Neon"" for me. That led to the purchase of the ""Where The Light Is"" DVD and to my, rather belated, discovery of a truly gifted songwriter and musician that need not take a back seat to anyone. This film captures Mayer's extraordinary artistry, versatility and commitment to excellence in his craft. Much like Martin Scorcese's ""Last Waltz"" the intimacy of the moment is captured and Mayer's guitar playing virtuosity is on full display. ""Where The Light Is"" could have benefited from more ""off stage"" scenes and conversations (a la ""Last Waltz"") but nonetheless the concert is a joy to watch for music lovers of any generation.",1363910400,,902,4.825806451612904

I wish he had another. I cant wait to buy his newer work, he has really set himself apart from a young POP musician. His vitality in every note gives you all of his energy. I would buy this becasuse it is a collective of his work.",1357516800,,401,4.025

Well, I guess if your only music exposure is through pop radio, you'll just keep wondering only until somehow you stumble upon this concert. See, obviously, outside Mayer's tabloid-worthy personal life, he IS first and foremost one of the greatest singer/songwriter and guitarist of our generation. So next time if you hear someone dismiss John Mayer as that ""cheesy Your Body is Wonderland singer"", just bitch slap him/her with this concert DVD and call it a day.",1353283200,2,601,4.96039603960396

3437547,5,B0019HQIFE,"The live concert released in 2008 featured three separate performances: the first was an acoustic set by Mayer alone, the second was with the John Mayer Trio, and the third with Mayer's regular touring band.

Musicians
All sets:
John Mayer - lead vocals, guitar

John Mayer Trio set:
Steve Jordan - drums, backing vocals,
Pino Palladino - bass

John Mayer band set:
David Ryan Harris - guitar, tambourine, backing vocals
Robbie McIntosh - guitar, slide guitar, backing vocals
David LaBruyere - bass
J.J. Johnson - drums
Tim Bradshaw - keyboards, lap steel guitar, backing vocals
Bob Reynolds - tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone
Brad Mason - trumpet, flugelhorn

The three concerts indicate that Mayer doesn't want to be categorized, as all three concerts vary greatly. I found the acoustic set as being typical Mayer, great musicianship (technical) but not a lot of imagination. He seems bored at times but delivers what the audience expects.

I enjoyed the ""Trio Set"" the most as this is where he is accompanied by session drummer Steve Jordan and my favorite bass player Pino Palladino. This is an aggressive forceful performance. There is a lot of energy being spent in this set. Awwwwsome.

Act three which includes the whole band is what you would expect as a Mayer fan with a lot of familiar material.

All in all it was money well spent. I enjoyed this concert DVD as it portrays how effortlessly Mayer can move from one genre of music to the next.",1349308800,,1456,4.846774193548387

The ""solo"" acoustic set was full of beautiful guitar work, the John Mayer Trio set was the big surprise for me, a whole new side of the performer I'd never seen. The set with the full band was so full, more so than on his previous DVD, but as I mentioned earlier, the JMT set just knocked me over; a different look, a different sound, a whole different John Mayer. For those who doubt this guy's guitar chops, the Trio set should answer all of that and cement his place among the finest guitarists of our time.",1347148800,,671,4.291338582677166

Audio quality:  Honestly, I only played it through my tv's speakers so I guess I can't really comment on the actual sound quality but it sounded great to me.

Concert itself:  One of the best concerts I've seen.  The differences between the acoustic, trio, and full band set makes it almost seem like you're watching 3 different concerts.  Mayer is also by far the best live performer I've heard.  Most artists simply don't sound as good live as they do in the controlled environment of a recording studio, but Mayer is consistently solid in all of his performances.  Perhaps it's because he's basically just sitting or standing instead of jumping around the stage dancing but whatever the reason, it's pure bliss listening to him make that guitar sing.

Overall, at under 20 bucks, this is a great value and a must have for any Mayer fan.",1326758400,,1140,4.611940298507463

I received the DVD today and I also bought the Adele too. I spent a $1,000 to make the ultimate surround sound at my home and I had heard the John Mayer with a surround sound they had and it sounded amazing but when I got it, I couldn't wait to put in the John Mayer and Adele DVDs, wow the music is incredible very clear and the picture is amazing.  I couldn't ask for more.  The last time I ordered from Best buy a dvd took 10 days before I got it.  So I saved about 7 or 8 bucks and got free shipping, tax free and my DVD in 3 days.  What more could I ask for,  I'll buy more more DVDs when I see more concerts I like.  I will order more DVDs again for sure.

Clean, clear, well balanced, and mixed for 5.1 perfectly.  If all 5.1 music was mixed like this everyone would buy much of it.  Perfection is in your hand when you hold the Blu Ray and it is in your room when you turn it on. The best of the three sets is the trio. I've never heard three musicians play with so much energy that you think it is a much larger band. Absolutely incredible.

Not only is John Mayer extremely talented as a musician, he is an entertainer of the highest degree as well.  I would have loved to have been at this concert in person.  Doing three sets with three different formats was genius.  It is a long concert.  John really gave his all for his fans. You can see how much he loves music and performing.

The movie starts with John driving his Mercedes with his lap dog on his lap, rambling on about himself. And that's not where it stops, throughout the entire movie he keeps telling the viewer or his live audience how fantastic and succesful he thinks he is.
If you like his music (which I do), rather just get the cd or download his music off the internet for free. Judging by his fancy car and watch collection he does not need the money anyway.",1286409600,,721,4.348148148148148

3437667,4,B0019HQIFE,"I'll start my review off with saying I was never the biggest fan of John Mayer.  After watching this concert and all the commentary between sets I've even less of a fan now.  He is however a very talented musician and I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the Trio (Blues and Jazz) section of this concert.

I bought this BluRay because of the positive reviews I read on Audio/Videophile sites.  The reviews were spot on.  Audio was always crystal clear and well mixed; which provides only enough crowd noise to remind you this is a live recording.  The use of the surround tracks was perfect with the majority of show coming through the main stereo channels and a nice mix of center and surrounds to add enough reverb to recreate the sound of the venue.

Video was again crystal clear and was nearly perfect.  Video quality is so great in 1080p you can actually read John Mayer's teleprompter in front of him.  Low levels (blacks) were always crisp even where contrasted with a spot light shining directly into camera lens.  Color was typically deep, but honestly a little boring and I found lacked the pop I expect with BluRay.  The acoustic set seemed washed out, but it maybe just the result of the harsh spot lights and gray colors worn by John.  The second set again was dull, but seemed to fit the mood of dimly lit Jazz bar.

Overall this is a good BluRay release, but between watching John sing from his Teleprompter all night (his eyes are focused there at least 50% of the show) and his commentary in between songs I'd probably pass if given the choice to buy this again.  If you like Mayer's music this would certainly be a decent way to enjoy your HiDef setup.",1267920000,,2046,5.065671641791044
3437668,5,B0019HQIFE,"I'm a John Mayer fan, I'll be the first one to admit that. I started listening to his music after room for squares hit during my freshman year of college. As I grew older so then came more John Mayer music and I've kept listening.

This blu-ray really is different than anything John has done before because it combines all the aspects of his music. The Jazz band, The acoustic sing song writer and the pop artist. It's all here and John actually doesn't play many of his hits, he plays songs in his catalog that may not heard before. This is good for me because a lot of the songs don't have previously recorded live versions. There are some small filler portions of the Blu-Ray that I think it could do without but overall it's mostly just music. I have to recommend this to anyone who wants to put together a collection of any of the best music/concerts on blu-ray this one stands somewhere on the top.",1266883200,,905,4.386904761904762
3437669,5,B0019HQIFE,This is a really great concert caught on film. I know it's sad to say but I never liked Gravity until I watched this. John Mayer is a really great live performer.,1266192000,,162,4.09375
3437670,5,B0019HQIFE,"I was not a big John Mayer fan until I got this DVD. His performance blew me away! His guitar playing was perfect, I don't think he played a miss note the whole concert! His acoustic opener was phenomenal,(He opened for him self) then gradually added other musicians to each song until he had the full band on stage. I liked this performance better than any of his CD's, which I bought a few after getting this. Very well produced, excellent picture and color, and the sound quality is outstanding with the DTS Master Audio and makes it one of the better concert Blu-ray's available. An absolute must have for fans and any one trying a Blu-ray concert for the first time, this one's a lot of fun and exciting to watch.

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get, it settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1265673600,2,1343,4.606694560669456
3437671,5,B0019HQIFE,"I would say that I am a fan of John Mayer's music, and I loved this film.

The thing I love the most is that this practically three concerts in one.  You get all three versions of John Mayer in one sitting.  It starts out with John Mayer as a soloist, practically only his voice and his guitar.  After that, he goes to the other extreme with his trio to play quite a bit of FANTASTIC blues.  This is my favorite part.  After that, it's John Mayer and the whole band. All ten-or-so musicians playing at once for most of his well known songs.

You off course get all of the songs you want to hear, plus some nice bonuses.  All the tracks sound very, very well and the whole concert is filmed with actual film cameras as opposed to DV, which to me gives it just the extra real-ness it needs and makes it just so much worth it.

If you are somewhat of a fan of this person's music, but this thing.  If you know a couple songs, buy it.  If you are a die-hard fan, BUY IT.

Conclusion: buy it.",1262995200,,987,4.05699481865285
3437672,5,B0019HQIFE,"As a european I haven't heard of Mayer before. But his Performance at the Michael Jackson memorial-service, where he performed a inspiring guitar-cover, made me look a bit closer.
The first of his songs that I heard was ""Daugthers"" (Where the light is - acoustic set). This got me hooked... Watching the available youtube resources I more and more came to the conclusion ... this DVD is a must-have.

So I gave the DVD as a christmas gift to my dad and we watched the show on the home cinema... incredible:

The acoustic-set contains such rich Guitars and vocals. Would love to know how they got this amazing guitar-sound. John not only plays really tight guitar, but also gives a driving rhythm just with his palm.
The trio-set is pure blues and fun. You can tell that they like what they do, that they challenge each other and that they are capable of creating an amazing sound landscape with limited instruments.
The band-set is pure creativity. John has gathered the creme de la creme and lives up to the challenge.

I like the self critic, to earth commentaries which John gives in between the set. He has a very sarcastic way of communicating with the audience.

He is my artist of the year 2009 ... the DVD might keep him at the top of the list for 2010 too. I personally find this DVD very inspiring and its great entrainment.",1262822400,,1334,4.545833333333333

I watched his ""Any Given Thursday"" DVD and was blow away! Then I saw his Trio set... But watching this DVD really gave me some goosebumps in ""Bold As Love,"" Jimmy Hendrix Cover, and Gravity... This is an AMAZING concert and has definitely made my DVD collection! The mood is set from the start with the acoustic set... then my favorite part which is the Trio (I love the Blues raw Guitar/Bass/Drum sound), then finishing up with the complete band which is GREAT!

John Mayer besides being a brilliant and talented musician with heart, produces some of the most amazing acoustic sound and vocals i have heard in a very long long long time!  My first song was ""Free Falin"" and that just led me to become an instant John Mayer fan!  besides the technical mumbo jumbo on this blu-ray, its the HEART felth riff  with which John Mayer plays is what really stands out.  This album as a whole is just heart moving and a nice breath of fresh air to any collection,

if you are sort of dead tired of all the clutter in your musical collection, get this album!  It will really bring you back to what you think you once had as an ear!  of course the whole HD sound is awesome too! the video looks just terrific on any LCD/Plasma.",1255651200,2,995,4.140625

He will become a legend as he experiments more and more with where his feelings lie.  He is contemporary and yet very very old blues school..I would hope he comes to the relization that he ""belongs"" on the same stage as the SRV's and the Eric's ... keep on keepin on John!",1255046400,,564,4.84375

3437692,5,B0019HQIFE,"No Matter how many times you pop this into your dvd player, you remain in a constant trance for its entire duration, just WAITING for john to play a note that is even slightly unsatisfying or to sing a note just slightly out of key, or to say something slightly foolish or lacking in wit between songs. Sorry, it just DOES NOT HAPPEN. But you still wait, everytime. Because it's hard to believe any musician can perform so flawlessly, especially when he is far from duplicating the recordings of the songs.

I Own many great live dvd's including Arriving somewhere (porcupine tree) and The song remains the same (Led Zeppelin) and none of them capture the magic of a show like this. So many great camera angles and the video quality is crystal Clear. It is like hovering around the stage attached to a wire hanging from the ceiling, right infront of john and the bands. No other artist has the same ability to singlehandedly forge incredibly original variations of his/ her own songs that are more captivating than the originals.

Like i said, buy this dvd and try to catch john performing to any other level but flawless.

Free Falling
Good Love is on the way
The heart of life
I Don't Need no doctor

Then I caught a few minutes of his performance at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festival.  Mayer's performance there was very reminiscent of SRV.  I didn't realize he had that style or ability in his repertoire.  Then the music service I use featured this album on their homepage and, after previewing it, I was hooked.  I purchased the Blu-ray recording of it and have watched it repeatedly.  The audio and video quality are excellent and the presentation is great.  It is more then just the concert.  It is a more private look at John Mayer and he seems to be a thoughtful and decent person.  As for the concert itself, it is three unique sets.  The first one is acoustic, some of it solo and some with one or two other guitarists.  The second set is the John Mayer Trio.  I love this set.  It has strong roots in the blues.  The last set is with a full band, including a horn section and covers John's more well known hits.  Slow Dancing in a Burning Room and Gravity are fantastic.  I discovered that I probably had not been paying close enough attention to the albums I had bought.  Mr. Mayer is a good lyricist and has things on his mind that he shares well in song.  The whole show is very enjoyable.  I've spent a fair bit on a nice home audio system and the recording sounds great coming through it.  If you're already a JM fan, you're sure to love this performance and recording.  If you're new to this artist, I think there's a fair chance you might soon have a new favorite.",1233619200,6,1617,4.337792642140468

3437759,2,B0019HQIFE,"First off, I'm a major John Mayer fan. I have all his CDs, along with the ""Any Given Thursday"" DVD. I think he's very talented, both as a musician and as a songwriter. I'm still a fan, and am eagerly awaiting his new CD later this year.

So why did I give it only two stars? Overall, my disappointment is a result of the song list. I like the songs themselves, but there aren't enough upbeat tunes in this concert. Obviously the acoustic set is subdued, but most of the ""band set"" is comprised of slower songs as well. It leaves a final reflection of ""Well, that was a sleeper of a show.""

On the plus side:
I like the idea of splitting the DVD into three sets of different genres: solo acoustic, blues rock, and the full band set.

There is a fair amount of interview time (much shot while John drives his car around town) spread across the disc.

On the down side:
The acoustic section is painfully boring. Even though ""Daughters"" and ""Stop this Train"", are basically acoustic numbers anyway, I don't think the songs in this set translate over to straight acoustic well. And he ruined ""Train"" by substituting the piano part with whistling - that just seemed awkward. Even when he brings other musicians onstage to share the guitar duties, it still feels empty. And his version of Freefallin' is just plain horrible. He trudges through it like it's a dirge.

I know he's expanding his blues skills, but when he nonchalantly played aimlessly wandering blues licks between (and during) songs it was more annoying than entertaining. Ditto for the ""Slow Dancing on Mulholland Drive"" section, which is just him talking and playing more blues runs. By the way, that ""special feature"" is only about five minutes long, barely worth listing on the package.

If you like the John Mayer Trio CD then you'll be pleased with the second set. It's done well, with a good amount of backstage footage of John, Pino, and Steve.

The 'band set"" should have had more of his older songs. Of the nine songs in this set, seven are from Continuum. Since the ""Thursday"" DVD came out prior to Heavier Things, he should have included more songs from that CD on this video. It's unfortunate that, with the exception of ""Something's Missing"" on ""Thursday"", there is no live footage from that album available. And as I mentioned above, many of the songs he chose for this set are slower ones, which drained the excitement out of what could have been an electrifying performance.

That's my opinion of this DVD, but seeing how many four and five star ratings others have given it, maybe you shouldn't take this review too seriously!

If you're at a toss-up of which live JM DVD to buy,I would suggest ""Any Given Thursday"" over this one.",1230940800,5,2706,4.609147609147609

I have seen a lot of DVD concerts but I have yet to see one that had the ability to engulf you into the concert. At one point of the show I had to remind myself that I was at home. I really did forget, and I think that has a lot to do with the way the sound was mastered. I highly recommend this Blu-Ray disc and any Concert that has the DTS sound available.

John plays three distinct sets - the first, mostly accoustic and by himself, is a lot of old favorites and some newer stuff - Set 2 is a blues bar set that you would swear John is channeling Stevie Ray Vaughan!

3437769,5,B0019HQIFE,I got this Blu-ray as part of a free offer with my new Sony Blu-ray player and I have to say it is a purchase that just keeps on giving. One reviewer complained about the sound and image. I think the sound is great. The image was also as good as get for an on stage performance. Yes at times you see a bit of grain in the lights but that is more ambiance than defect. Low light recording does produce artifacts even in high defintion. The amount of music on this disc is huge as is its diversity as he plays solo and with two different bands. Great buy!,1222128000,,553,4.036363636363636
3437770,5,B0019HQIFE,"I highly recommend this DVD! I'm amazed with John's performance, the best i've ever seen. Two words, buy it!",1221782400,,108,4.7368421052631575
3437771,4,B0019HQIFE,"I suspect that most people who are considering buying this disc are already familiar with John Mayer.  Then again, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got the disc with Sony's promotion for their Blu-ray player.

One review panned the disc because of bad video and sound quality.  The quality you get will depend on your equipment.  I have Sony's top end current generation TV, and their newest Blu-ray player, so I assume that I'm seeing it as they intended it.  The video quality does not rise to what you might expect from blu-ray.  Because of the concert hall spot lights, faces were washed out and lacking in detail.

As for the sound, a good recording can sound bad on bad equipment, but you can't make a bad recording sound good on good equipment. Top quality equipment will reproduce every flaw. If others heard good sound, there's a reason. The sound is excellent.

But what's most important is the music and presentation. If you are already a fan, stop reading and buy it.  In my case, the audience members looked closer to my children's age than mine, so he obviously appeals to a younger fan base.  But if you grew up listening to guitar, and enjoy the music of guitar heroes whose music is rooted in blues, you can be 60 and still like this music.

His singing is very good, and his guitar playing is excellent.  I wouldn't use the word virtuoso, but I would say that he plays with feeling and emotion.  His music is compelling.

His guitar style is a blend of originality and channeling classic players.  His acoustic style shows originality and his acoustic set is quite good.  He then goes to an electric set with a trio, and starts with a classic blues song.  On that one, his playing lacked originality, but had plenty of feel.  If you liked the original, you'll like this because the feel is there, but I think he is capable of more.

He then went into a Hendrix cover, but he made it his own. It showed his talent.  Later, he played some blues songs where he seemed to channel Hendrix in his style, and there are also hints of many other players in his playing.

His blend of styles, song writing and playing show that he is not somebody whose songs will sound the same or be stuck in a narrow genre. The video quality could have been better, but it's the music that counts.",1220918400,2,2292,4.448441247002398
3437772,5,B0019HQIFE,I've watched this one several times and I have only had it for a week.  It is great to see John Mayer as more than just the pop star.  This show includes a large variety of his musical interests.  I highly recommend it.,1220745600,,219,4.046511627906977
3437773,5,B0019HQIFE,"John Mayer will go down in history as one of the very best guitarists.  This gives you a wide variety of John Mayer.  Solo, unplugged, incredible blues, and the popular stuff.  It covers it all.  I really like this DVD.  I think very highly of John after this.  Well worth the purchase if you like: Blues, Accustic, and or his popular stuff.",1220313600,,341,4.419354838709677
3437774,5,B0019HQIFE,"If there's one thing that John Mayer makes clear on this concert release, it's that he's not just the handsome pop-rock star that he has been painted as throughout his rise to fame.  Mayer is really a man of two talents:  A knack for catchy singer-songwriter radio hits, and some serious talent on blues guitar to the point where he's played with the likes of Eric Clapton and Herbie Handcock.

""Where the Light Is"" works as both a showcase piece and perception-breaker for Mayer, who plays three distinct sets in a single night in L.A.  The concert holds an loose and intimate feel, filmed in an appropriately conservative manner to allow viewers to observe the nuances of the performance.

Highlights include a fantastic surprise Tom Petty cover to close the acoustic set, and a surprisingly rollicking trio set where Mayer pulls out continuous blues licks like a kid in a candy store.

The fantastic visual quality of this blu-ray release is certain not to disappoint.  It will satisfy longtime John Mayer fans, as well as turn the heads of those who may have written him off in the past.  It is an excellent value by any standard, and a standout performance.",1219968000,,1162,4.746268656716418

3437777,5,B0019HQIFE,"I have seen John Mayer three times in concert and he is amazing. This CD/DVD really highlight that. This would have been a great show to see. He does a few songs acoustically (Neon, Stop This Train, In Your Atmosphere, Daughters, Free Falling (from Tom Petty fame)), then brings out the John Mayer Trio for a set (Everyday I Have The Blues, Wait Until Tomorrow, Who Did You Think I Was, Come When I Call, Good Love Is On The Way, Out Of My Mind, Vultures, Bold As Love). Finally the whole band plays a third set (Waiting On The World To Change, Slow Dancing In A Burning Room, Why Georgia, The Heart Of Live, I Don't Need No Doctor, Gravity, I Don't Trust Myself, Belief, I'm Gonna Find Another You) . All told there are 22 songs.
My favorites are Who Did You Think I Was, Gravity, Waiting On The World To Change and Good Love Is On The Way. The band, either John Mayer Trio or his regular band are fabulous. If you like John Mayer, you'll love this CD/DVD!",1219536000,,957,4.263736263736264

  I highly recommend buying this Blu Ray you will not be disappointed. You can listen to the tracks in PCM 2.0 or TRUE HD 5.1 both sound great. I preferred the 5.1 it was like we were at the concert.
  The picture and sound is amazing. There is nothing from what I can see or hear the picture is clear and crisp and the sound like I said before it is like you are there.. If you have a good receiver and Blu Ray player that can decode the HD audio and a HDTV for the 1080p Picture and some good speakers you are set to go.

3437781,5,B0019HQIFE,I love John Mayer so naturally I like this dvd. The three part series shows him in three different acts. They all were excellent.,1218153600,,129,4.416666666666667
3437782,5,B0019HQIFE,"I've been lucky enough to see Mayer in concert.  Add to that a couple appearances on Austin City Limits and two at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festivals.  For a little variety, throw in an appearance with Brad Paisley on CMT's Crossroads.

Mayer never disappoints and never ceases to surprise.  It would be easy to dismiss him as a purveyor of commercial accoustic romantic ballads if the only only material one ever heard were from Room for Squares.  In fairness a couple of those tracks were overplayed to the point of causing an allergic reaction.

Taking in his live appearances and the various concert shows one soon realizes that Mayer is a virtuoso.  The only personal analogy that I can make is Winton Marsalis.  The complete command of technical capability is eclipsed only by an instinctive 'feel' that transcends the notes on a page.

Mayer was wonderful with Double Trouble.  His Austin City Limits cover of Empty Arms was a worthy tribute to Steve Ray.  His performance with Buddy Guy was probably the surest sign I have ever seen that race no longer has a place in sports, politics or even music.  Was that really a kid from Connecticut outdueling the legendary bluesman?

Where The Light Is delivers.  Production quality is good, the play list is expansive and extends well beyond the customary radio roster.

The cover of Tom Petty's Free Fallin' made the DVD for me.  It's a simple three chord song.  I was just stunned that Mayer could develop a different and interesting arrangement, play it so perfecftly and exhibit such enthusiasm doing it.

Don't wait.  Idolize this guy now.  Most of the artistic geniuses labor in relative anonymity until way past their prime.  This guy is the read deal and this DVD shows him in his element.

As evidence of my objectivity, I have to remark that the vocal on Belief is a little flat.  It's one of my favorite songs and the version on the most recent Crossroads disk is much better.  It's a little like a bad hair day for Heather Locklear.  Hard to imagine throwing her out for a momentary lapse!

Enjoy",1217894400,4,2060,4.716292134831461
3437783,5,B0019HQIFE,"I buy discs rarely. I usually just rent from Netflix, which is where I managed to find this gem. I liked John Mayer's music before, I appreciate the man's talent even more after watching this live performance.
If you like his album Continuum or the bluesy John Mayer Trio, you should definitely check this out. His voice and skills with the guitar shine in this performance. On Blu-Ray the quality of the video stands out as well.
I'm buying this one, it merits playing over and over.",1217894400,2,484,4.574712643678161

Over the past 5 years, he has picked up some incredible blues chops and is becoming an even better entertainer.  He is very versatile in pop, blues, rock, and the sky is the limit for this 30-year old star.  John Mayer is relevant and has staying power.

Personally, I don't know what is so great about Gravity.  The lyrics are great but I just feel the song never takes off.  It is kinda blah the entire song.  Other than that, every song is spot on.  Just buy it.

If you have a blu-ray player, don't skimp out.  But the Blu-ray.  Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with the dvd and its 5.1 audio.  If you have good speakers the music will image great.  The rears are purely for fan noise and ambiance.",1217548800,2,712,4.177777777777778

Each time I hear Mayer on guitar, I'd swear that he visited the Crossroads since the last time I heard him; he just gets better and better.

I enjoyed this concert, and for those who've never seen Mayer live, this will be a suitable substitute. In my opinion, some of the material doesn't convert well to cd listening, but the DVD is excellent and worth the money.",1217116800,,537,4.316831683168317

3437800,5,B0019HQIFE,"Discovered JM four years ago on a trip to the US at a record store in Dallas.  Had absolutely no idea what I was buying, but I got caught by the fresh and young image at  ""room for squares"" record.  I am guitar fan, and watching this young guy reminded my of the time I also discovered Kenny Wayne Shepperd, also by pure intuition.
My intuition about John became one of the greatest personal discoveries that I have ever had, the amount of joy I get when listening to JM and by watching his concerts, is just beyond great.
The talent to handle both hands on a variety of guitars is like he invented the instrument; it seems that he thinks and the instrument translates into sounds, sounds that are new, intelligent, creative, profound, full of love and of course, full of meaning.
I bought, at the same time, both the DVD and the CD, knowing I was making the right thing.  Now, having watched the DVD I am thinking of buying a dozen more for my friends, for the people I love I want them to feel the same emotions and admiration for this creature of nature that positively completes in an intelligent and enjoyable manner, any situation of our days life.
This material is definitely a valuable piece for any collection, from cinematographic perspective, music or poetry, is a must have.

I love how the concert has three separate acts (an acoustic set, a set with the trio and a set with the full band) and the sound is amazing in PCM 2.0.  The only thing I have to complain about is the cheap cardboard case it comes with.  It's not the standard plastic case and the disc sits in a plastic tray glued to a folded cardboard case.  Awful!

Mayer plays with so much intensity and energy and really is a virtuoso at what he does all around.  This young man definitely has got it right down to his bones with talent.  His guitar playing is superb and along with his vocal style of singing what a combo.  I think this just might be one of the best DVD's in my collection and with what I have, that is saying a lot.

In the midst of a myriad of dance bands and pretty faces covering other peoples music it is truly refreshing to see an excellent singer/songwriter of John Mayer's caliber putting out CD after CD that seem to get better as he matures. This DVD show him in three different settings; solo, with just his guitar and michrophone, then with his trio of ace session players Pino Paladino on bass and the amazing Steve Jordan on drums, and lastly he segues into his full eight piece band. The videography is tastfully done in the vain of the Band's Last Waltz, with John talking to the camera in between sets.

So needless to say I was waiting for him to come out with a lengthy live DVD, and people this is it.

As of today however, he has become an incredible artist whose guitar playing can appeal to various guitar geeks, while his songs can appeal to a wide range of audiences ranging from teenage girls who just listen to him because he is ""hot"" or those who have an open mind to different types of music. I can say that I first became a fan of John Mayer with the Trio album and then I listened to Continuum. I was thinking it was just going to be another acoustic pop John Mayer record but I was sorely mistaken. This is my favorite album by Mr. Mayer because you get the John Mayer Trio (the blusey side that sounds a bit like SRV, Hendrix, Buddy Guy, BB King, etc.), the sensitive songwriter personality (even that part of the album isn't that bad), and the band set (which consists of mostly Continuum cuts) all in one package. This album proves that Mr. Mayer has matured as a musician and is a force to be reckoned with.

3437812,4,B0019HQIFE,"I was fortunate enough to see Where the Light Is on the big screen. The only drawback was that I saw an edited version of the DVD. The DVD clocks in at 164 minutes and the version I saw was only 90 minutes.

This film shows us, what Mayer calls, his three incarnations; Introspective acoustic artist, rocking power trio guitarist and hit producing singer/songwriter. To me, they don't feel like three different people. The talent and heart of John Mayer weave through all of these, so-called, incarnations to hold them together.

Shot on film, the movie has the feel of some classic concert movies. A bunch of cameras with interesting angles and some smooth editing lend an intimacy to the viewing experience. You get to see perspectives not normally seen during a live show and seeing it on the big screen, close-up and personal added a level of excitement that you don't get while watching a DVD on your TV. But I'm sure the soul and power will still come through for the home viewer.

Acoustic artist John starts the show with some nice, jazz tinged numbers to get things warmed up and the large amount of close-ups and shots that wrap around him while he performs, invite you into a place you normally wouldn't be able to go. On Neon Mayer exhibits his nimble fingers and creative chord changes we don't normally see in a pop artist and a nicely arranged version of Tom Petty's Free Fallin' fits nicely into the set.

Johnny and the Trio play the second set and they really can rock. Like power trios of the past, such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream, these three highly talented musicians push each other to their limits and pull us along with them. At times it was like a roaring locomotive with all three frantically stoking the fire. On the exceptional slow blues number Out of My Mind there is a fire burning as Mayer wrings every note from the neck of his guitar until, it seems, there's nothing left.

The hit producing singer/songwriter closed the show and his band, as tight as ever, doesn't disappoint. One of the highlights was a moving version of Gravity that featured one of Mayer's heartfelt guitar solos that never fail to impress. One nice thing, for me, was his staying away from some of the sappier pop songs that I normally skip over on my iPod.

There's some insightful commentary by Mayer that opens the film and is interspersed between numbers and these clips are short enough to keep the film moving along nicely.

If you're a John Mayer fan there is plenty here to satisfy you. If you're not familiar with Mr. Mayer's work this film is a great introduction to a young talent who, I feel, still has plenty of room to grow as an artist.",1214870400,30,2671,4.5636743215031315
3437813,5,B0019HQIFE,"I'll just start off by saying that I was fortunate enough to sit front row at this concert. It was definitely the best concert I have ever been to. This is pertinent because I witnessed it live and have now seen it in recorded form. I must say, that this film accurately and genuinely captures the magic and electricity of that night.
The film is amazing as well. I say film, because it's not just a concert video. There are also bits of commentary and insight from John Mayer. This, combined with the inspiring cinemaphotography, precise editing, and the great music itself, makes for a rediculously enjoyable experience. Even if you are not a fan of Mayer's music, you'll have to agree that this is simply a great film, based on the high production quality alone. I, like many others, am a huge live music fan and own many concerts on DVD, Blu-Ray, CD, etc., but this beautiful example of ""pure"" art certainly ranks at the top and anyone would be doing a disservice to themselves by not adding it to their collection.",1214784000,18,1019,4.573770491803279
