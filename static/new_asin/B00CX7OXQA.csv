5750793,4,B00CX7OXQA,"There is only reason to see this movie - Kellan Lutz.
For the first time in his career he demonstrates he actually can act.
Don't. Get me wrong, his role is, at best a cameo. But he steals every scene he is in.
This is an even more impressive accomishment when you realize that he only has dialogue in the final brief scene.

The rest of the movie is ""so so"" the mostly in appealing Cast undergoes  situations which we really do nt care about.

5750794,3,B00CX7OXQA,"Good cast, good story.  Amazed how many decent movies are lost in the shuffle and not forced on us by the corporate and media world.",1387238400,,132,4.28
5750795,4,B00CX7OXQA,"The only reason I checked this movie out was because Amber Heard was it in and I'm not disappointed that I did.  She has a major role in the film and looks absolutely stunning on screen.

The movie itself takes a clear swing at how easily manipulated people are by the advertisements that we see each and every day.  The premise is a bit far fetched, but I do believe that was the point.  Heard plays a marketing exec named Six who is pitched the idea for a new energy drink by a slacker named Scat played by Shiloh Frenandez.  Being a slacker, he doesn't have a formula or anything special at all, all he really has is the name which is a different spelling of the ""F word.""  Of course he doesn't trademark the name but his best friend does netting the friend the million dollar payday.

If you're looking for a movie that is realistic and makes perfect sense than you'll probably find ""Syrup"" lacking.  If you're willing to go along for the ride and enjoy the humor that is how easily we fall victim to advertisers than you'll probably like this movie a lot.",1386979200,10,1060,4.345177664974619
5750796,3,B00CX7OXQA,"I'm sure the film itself is great, as is the book, but I wrongly assumed it would play in the UK.  Too expensive to return - just warning anybody else thinking of buying outside the US, it will not work!  It doesn't look like they are going to release it in the UK so we shall have to do without!",1386288000,,296,3.9166666666666665
5750797,4,B00CX7OXQA,"""Looking at a billboard is supposed to feel like love at first sight but it's not real, it's just marketing and without it you wouldn't even know who you are."" Scat (Fernandez) is fresh out of marketing school with no prospects on the horizon until he comes up with an idea for a new energy drink. When he brings it to the attention of Six (Heard) he is excited at the prospect of becoming rich but a double cross changes everything. With the job I have I pretty much watch everything no matter what it is. I usually don't watch the trailers for the movie because I don't like when they give too much away. Doing it that way makes what I watch real hit or miss as far as how good it is. What I have noticed is that the lower budget movies that I haven't heard of are 99% of the time better then the ""studio"" movies. This is a perfect example of that. I don't know if satire is the right word but the movie to me shows how the marketing industry will do whatever it takes to sell a product and how gullible the public is when it comes to branding. The movie does get a little dark at times but that proves it's point all the more. The movie is entertaining and funny but to me this is more of a statement movie. I could also be reading way too much into it though. Overall, a huge surprise of a movie that I highly recommend. I give it an A-.",1377129600,6,1341,4.064150943396227
5750818,1,B00CX7OXQA,"For me it was just a pretty girl from the movie ""The River Why"" Swearing like a sailor in a movie with no redeeming attributes. Amber is nice looking and not a bad actress BUT the writing-dialog in this movie was JUST PLAIN UGLY. Al Pacino can make foul language a virtue as in ""Stand Up Guys"" (a favourite) BUT A TRASHMOUTH just to maybe get a PG-13 or R rating is pretty obvious!! I shredded the disc... whereas I usually just donate losers.
Amber -- I don't know who advised you to do this movie -- maybe your budget... but it won't help your career & doesn't speak well of your judgement!",1441324800,,592,4.247787610619469

5750823,5,B00CX7OXQA,"A great movie for the cynical-minded. It lets you enjoy your hatred of corporate/marketing culture while liking the characters at the same time. The movie ""breaks the fourth wall"" to talk to the audience frequently, but it is part of the mood of the movie (as with Fight Club). There is little that feels forced upon the audience (although one of those things is the love interest), not even the ending ... despite the fact that the novel had a very forced ending. It's one of my favorite 'finds' in movies.",1427673600,,507,4.582417582417582

5750854,5,B00CX7OXQA,"I originally watched this via Netflix, and ended up watching it several more times, so I ordered it for a friend who used to work in advertising w/me. If you work in marketing or advertising, it'll probably amuse you for multiple reasons. But even if you don't, there's just something smart, sexy, and addicting about this movie. Yet, it's one where you're kind of embarrassed to say you like it. It'll probably be one of those films that develops a cult following -- it just has that feel. I want to order the book, too.",1402617600,2,521,4.494736842105263

5750856,5,B00CX7OXQA,"I have to say that I have been on a very good roll with my small Indie movies. Syrup is no exception..I thought for sure it was a throwaway type movie and as it turned out, it was so much more.  The best performance by far is Shiloh Fernandez, I have just become a huge fan...his wide-eyed optimist totally won me over. Amber Heard as the business driven and cool lady was very good, Kellan Lutz (he was why I got the movie) had a somewhat small and albeit silent role. To put it on the line....it is a movie about cutthroat business practices in advertising...I loved it and really recommend it.",1391212800,4,596,4.321428571428571

8587167,4,B00CX7OXQA,"Syrup is a cerebral comedy with quite a bit of underlying insight into manipulative marketing techniques.  The humor seems to operate at least two levels throughout, one the obvious broad guffaw while beneath it is the thoughtful irony of how easily the human mind is manipulated by unscrupulous marketeers.",1490832000,,307,5.26530612244898
8587168,3,B00CX7OXQA,"Disclosure:  this is basically a 2 star movie.  As always, it gets bumped up 1 extra star because it stars Amber Heard.  It is hard to describe the plot, other than to say it pokes fun @ advertising types kind of like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escanaba-in-Da-Moonlight/dp/B00006HAX7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escanaba in Da Moonlight</a>&nbsp;pokes fun @ deer hunters.  Strange movie to make an analogy to, I know, but that's what popped into my head as I was watching this film.

While the movie has some salacious qualities to it, it is ultimately a teaser flick.  Would have been much better had it ""gone that way"" and been more, but it is what it is.  People who are waiting with baited breath for Amber to strip down will be disappointed.  For people who are aching to see Amber Heard dance around topless, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Informers/dp/B00275EGNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Informers</a>.
