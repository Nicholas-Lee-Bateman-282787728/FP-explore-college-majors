8378534,5,B0006URGX8,"An utter cinematic masterpiece, reminiscent of Andy Warhol pictures from the mid-1960's. This film operates on three different levels; the sublime, the self-effacing and the historic. It must be watched in the context of the 1960's hollywood club and music and sexual scene of freedom and liberation.  The director, and producer, William Buzick was a cinematic and sexual genius. One of the great figures to have swept across the mid-20th century of Los Angeles. His mind covertly absorbed the images, scents, colors and relationships of the sunset boulevard of that drug induced era. A graduate of the noted Pasadena Art Center with a major in film noire and a minor in popular culture and a trust fund estimated at $19 million, he had the ability and wherewithal to compose a film of such historic dimension.  Artistically, the film draws a wonderful picture of the violence, and passion and ambivalence of the Vietnam era. It draws you in with the exotic locales, and subtle beauty of the female heroines in their lustful elegance. It took Sir William three years to create this cinematic universe, and was shown at Cannes and the Montreal and Palm Springs film festivals with thunderous acclaim in 1997.  One day this film will be compared The Deer Hunter and Almost Famous as capturing the complex youthful passions of that klaidescopic world.",1370476800,,1348,5.008928571428571
8378535,5,B0006URGX8,"a must see. William Buzick is a legendary filmmaker now in heaven. he was a millionaire genius with a gift for the mysterious. his next film was to be shot in rio with m. madsen and dennis hopper, but is on hold.  this film was shot on skyline drive in the hollywood hills and Hawaii. It is perhaps the most intriguing and subtle cinematic noire film ever completed. It highlights the acting skills of Dino Desby with his line about pink peruvian crack rock that is one of the funniest lines ever uttered by a john candy-like actor. The cloud sequence in Hawaii is stunning with heli-shots from above. the vietnam scenes are reminiscent of Platoon and the Deer Hunter. This movie will one day be compare to orson welles' citizen kane.",1341619200,,734,4.5606060606060606
