Still, this course in combination with the book I purchased is making me feel much more confident and helping shorten the learning curve.

8714651,4,B00WZPMQKA,The material was great but a lot of it was too general.  Would have liked to see more specific info on the D5500,1449619200,,112,3.869565217391304

8714653,4,B00WZPMQKA,"I am a beginner, and I found the choice of topics to be very good.  There is a lot of content.  The DVD covers the fundamentals of photography and composition as well as giving a detailed user manual for the Nikon D5500.  The emphasis is on taking photographs, but there is a section that discusses video shooting.  The coverage of the camera moves from basics to details.  In the details section every single menu item is discussed.  For me, the coverage of the camera and its features was much easier than reading the manual, and this content alone was worth the purchase.

However, the fact that the detailed coverage of the camera is combined with the photography school and other general information is what makes the DVD so good for a beginner.  There are examples and diagrams that show the concepts of focal length, field of view, and depth of field that I found particularly helpful.  Some of the photography school portion is more difficult to understand than it needs to be, and I had to replay the videos multiple times or supplement with other YouTube videos to completely understand.  Some feature details are not completely described or illustrated, but the author probably made the right choice in how much detail to present.

If you don't want to spend the money, you can search YouTube and find free videos from a variety of sources that will cover most the topics on the DVD.  The author has done a good job of selecting the topics and making a complete package of consistent videos that will save you the hassle of putting together your own beginning photography course and camera manual.  Also, once you have listened to the DVD, you will be better prepared to search out YouTube videos on your own.",1444694400,6,1720,4.693333333333333
8714654,5,B00WZPMQKA,"This video is very useful in starting to know your Nikon better. It has helped me in doing so, having  bought the camera and not really knowing how to really get a full view on using my Nikon. The instructor explains everything very clearly and the visuals help just as much! I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn about on, how to get the full use out of your Nikon.",1433462400,2,384,4.1891891891891895
8714655,5,B00WZPMQKA,"My head is spinning. Michael has everything a novice like could ever want ... and so, so much more! I bought this video because I have a huge shoot coming up in June. I am creating some marketing materials for my novel series that require me to travel to North Carolina to get some photo and video shots of a place applicable to my series -- but soon, the place in question is going to be bulldozed into a park. Thus, this is my only chance to get the shots I need (forever!).

Tried unsuccessfully to hire a photographer to take the shots I needed: no good outcome. So I decided to do it myself. I found a good camera (I hope) and then started panicking that I have no idea how to shoot pictures (real pictures). I have four days to learn what I need to do.

Michael is informative. And he doesn't skimp on anything! His lessons are clear (though it does take someone like me watching it on repeat several times), his direction is good, and his results speak for themselves. I only wish I could have talked to him for 10 minutes to get his recommendation for three specific shots. Scared to death, here.

I would recommend Michael's video to anyone who needs any level of information/training on photography in general or the Nikon D5500 specifically. He's fantastic. Worth every penny -- seriously.

If I had one area of constructive criticism for Michael, it would be to review some of the lessons he has there. He appears to reference examples for other cameras when saying you can hit this or that button (e.g., there is no White Balance button readily accessible on this camera). Other than that, I would only ask for more visual examples of the principals he uses. I learn visually, so it's nice to have that, along with some general tips on possible settings for specific types of shoots. Novices (like me) could use them and more experienced photographers could use them or ignore them.

Everything being equal, I would highly recommend this video (or any one of his other ones). Great buy!",1433030400,5,1999,4.541666666666667
