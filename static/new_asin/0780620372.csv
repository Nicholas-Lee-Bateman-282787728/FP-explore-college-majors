30578,5,0780620372,I was not luck enough to see this wonderful movies when it was a play but i am forever grateful that i had a chance to see and the later purchase this wonderful movie. LVC shows us whats its like to have a group of  friends so close that sharing ones feelings and needs need not be an  exercise in terror. Yes there are sterotypes but hey i know myself i  identified with a few of the characters.  LVC has it all honesty laughs and  a great cast. Jason alexander as buzz made me laugh and cry and John Glover  doing dual rolls omg how incredible.  This is a must see,944179200,2,566,4.045045045045045
30579,5,0780620372,"I suppose I can understand where so many of my fellow viewers claim that the characters in L!V!C! are sterotypes.  For the most part, they do fall into cliched perceptions of gay men...however one must bear in mind that  not only is the author a gay man...he is a multiple Tony award winning  playwright..one has to assume he knows that of which he writes.  L!V!C! was  a beautitful, tocuhing and laugh-out-loud funny piece of theatre when I saw  it on Broadway, and it lost none of it's elegance in it's translation to  film.  The cast is superb...and for those who critisize Jason Alexander's  performance as being one-dimensional obviously didn't watch through until  the end of the film.  Alexander delivers a rich, layered interpretion of  the show-tune singing Buzz...and brings levels to the character that were  left completely unexplored in the stage version.  L!V!C! is one of those  rare film that you can watch again and again because it has it all...you'll  laugh out loud, you'll muse at difficult truths, you'll learn a little  something about yourself and you might just shed a few tears.  An extremely  worthwhile film penned by one of the Great American Masters...treat  yourself and view this film at the first oppertunity you get.",935452800,40,1250,4.946859903381642

It is a tad dated as the times & HIV/AIDS treatments have changed, however, that being said, there is still much ignorance surrounding AIDS.

30604,5,0780620372,"This movie is wonderful, but definitely not for everyone. If you are offended by nudity or homosexual relationships - then this is not for you. If you don't mind - then I recommend you watch. The story is simple (a group of friends getting together for various holidays) and yet complicated at the same time (the group dynamic, the individual relationships between the men). Romance, drama, betrayal, and a good deal of angst. This movie will give you a good hearty laugh, just before making you cry like a little girl. Watch it with tissues.

If nothing else, watch it just for the pleasure of seeing Jason Alexander as a Broadway-obsessed effeminately gay man.",1258156800,3,662,4.807017543859649
30605,2,0780620372,"If only the director and screenwriter were among them!  This film version of the Broadway play about gay friends who spend three summer weekends together is incredibly clich&eacute;, forced, and feels anything but spontaneous.

Old friends getting together could be interesting, but all these people talk about is being gay and it gets old fast.  There isn't one line of dialogue that is believable or one character that rings true; they're too glib and there's no connection between them or with me. Jason Alexander does a good Nathan Lane impersonation but it's way too much and Lane is better.  John Glover plays twin brothers, one a cranky sourpuss who desperately wants to be loved, the other a sweetheart dying of AIDS.  Neither seemed real to me.  The other characters were more subdued and tolerable, but they still perform like they're reciting lines; there are no pauses or nuances, their characters have no real love, valour, or compassion.

This MUST have played better on the stage, since most of the cast is from the play, but it misses the mark on the big screen.  For me, it was tedious and disappointing and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boys-in-the-Band/dp/B001CQONPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boys in the Band</a>&nbsp;from 1970 is a far better film.",1220054400,3,1323,5.450980392156863

30608,4,0780620372,"This is not a bad film; production values are reasonably high, especially the gorgeous cinematography. Terrence McNally's talky play simply doesn't have the same impact. Still, the cast is attractive, and each character maintains a sense of individuality. Most impressive is John Glover's magnificent performance(s) in dual roles. It could easily have resulted in some atrocious over-acing, but Glover keeps it centered and simple. His performance alone is the best reason to watch this film.",1178928000,4,492,5.573333333333333

30611,4,0780620372,"When I saw the play it moved me from tears to laughter to reality.  This is a big part of the gay culture that up to then, was widely overlooked.  A group of close gay friends, couples & singles, who relate to each other with love, valour & compassion!  The movie does the same & the cast, both gay & straight bring out the characters as intended!  It is well acted, presented, photographed and told.  For me, it's a movie to rewatch many times because the story tells the title.  Well done!",1168819200,4,491,4.282608695652174
30612,5,0780620372,"I started out thinking e-Gad is this movie ever so slow.  Then I said jeepers the gay guys in this movie are so totally queenie!  I was right on the verge of shutting down the DVD player a few times but just as I was tired the Movie to shift on me and get really good.

Its not the movies fault, this time the flaw was in the viewer not the subject matter being seen.  I am spoiled by most of todays movies that unfold quickly and take little or no time for real character development.  I was filled with pre-concieved idea on where I felt the plot would zig and at every turn it zagged.

This movie defied me.  The characters were queenie, witty and rich with layers of personality slathered on to the point where they felt real something else I am not used to in most movies.  At first I did not honestly care about any of the characters and worse I could not even imagine myself liking any of them.  As time passed I did however find myself loving the characters or at least identifying with each of them in different ways.

Love! Valour! Compassion! is the first movie I have ever seen with a sad ending that is not really totally sad.  My word for this movie is real.  This movie was bold in that it did not end with a warm and fuzzy text book ending and neither did it end in utter tradegy.  The movie just left you thinking about how valuable friends are.  This movie forces you to realise how important every moment of your life is.

I guess this movie won me over because it shows the real complexity of friendships the good the bad the warts and all. Love! Valour! Compassion! made me think but more it made me appriciate my life and friends even more.  Love! Valour! Compassion! did not leave me sad it just left me changed for the better in what exact ways I have not figured out yet.  Love! Valour! Compassion! taught me more than a few valuable lessons most of which are still swirling around in my head.  I highly recommend buying Love! Valour! Compassion! because it is fun and an awesome tool to make you think.

30613,5,0780620372,"The stellar performances of Jason Alexander (Buzz) and John Glover (James/John) make this movie, providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film. The Swan Lake scene, while funny, is probably the most sad, as each character explains how he will pass on.

Yet the most interesting character to me is Gregory, as he is the glue that holds this group of men together, generously offering his Victorian house for holiday vacations. It is he who starts the film with his narration, welcoming the viewer in as if we are a visitor to his home as well, and having the final narration during the Swan Lake scene. He is caretaker to his friends in life and in death, and the central character that the six others revolve around; it is befitting that he will be the last to go.

Each character struggles with his own demons; we are privy to their personal pain, yet all manage to rise above their problems and find joy in life and with each other's companionship. Even the most detestable character, John, is not entirely unsympathetic.

Yes, there's some stereotypical moments, but all in all, this is an enjoyable film, one that leaves an indelible impression.",1142812800,5,1165,4.757425742574258
30614,4,0780620372,"An interesting film that revolves around a group of middle-aged gay men who are struggling with aging, past regrets, and their livelihoods--all while simultaneously dealing with their own romantic issues. The actors give accomplished performances, even though the men sometimes sound and act the same (however, what can you expect when they all arise from the same social background and cultural group?).

30615,5,0780620372,"This movie was great!  I read the reviews on the site and a few were not so good...thus, I was a little leary on whether I should buy the movie vs. rent.  To my surprise... the movie came on that same night on a movie channel.  I couldn't turn away from the tv.  The movie was very touching.  The cast of charachters couldn't have been any better.  Jason Alexander, was the biggest surprise of the film.  He did an amazing job.  I will admit at first, I too was a lil leary about the flim within the first 15 minutes or so...b/c it wasn't as clear as it should have been.  However, after the plot thickened so did the movie.  This movie is a totally divine movie and a must watch for all alike.  Absolutely, I will buy this one for sure and can't to watch again and again.  BUY THIS FILM!

Anyone who has lived through an intense sibling rivalry which went berserk and egos took on lives of their own  should be able to relate to the dynamics of John and James Jeckyll.

The most poignant scene in the entire movie is towards the end when each character depicts how and when they died -- and especially from the vantage of the one who was left (the one who owned the house) who buried them all.",1116115200,4,1001,4.429347826086956
30617,5,0780620372,"This is a story of differences. Differences of opinions. Differences of lifestyles. Differences of life paths. I could tell that this film was based off of a play when I saw it because of its rich character driven plot and its character development. The standout performance would have to go to John Glover pulling double duty as brothers, one sick with HIV and the other cynical and a dark cloud over his friends happiness. A particularly memorable scene pits Glover with everyone else during a dinning room conversation and everyone tells him what he can do about his opinions to which he snappily, and rather coldly, put every last one of them down. Randy Becker was the films sexual draw because his character exuded sexual desire and hinted at sexual decadance. There is a scene early on that foreshadows his crossing of boundries in a relationship that was decent before he came along. Even after the damage is done, he seems so self centered to really care about who he hurt and who he royally pissed off. Of course, he gets a moment of enlightenment as Greg shows him the other uses a blender has. Justin Kirk does a particularly good job playing the blind Bobby, the unattainable object of Ramon's (Becker) lust. The moment he is introduced, he is feeling the trees in the yard, visualising them with his hand. The moment has a odd erotic feel to it and yet, it is also a picturesque moment of one mans love for the very things others take for granted. Jason Alexander (Buzz) is the signature over the top, flamboyant character. He has some funny bits about music and its downward spiral in the face of diminishing musicals. He comes off a bit depressing until he he meets James (Glover as the better half) and the two fall in love. Both man are infected with HIV and both men are toying with the thoughts of life ending soon. The moments they share on screen are pretty but they are also tinged with a dark, depressing state of hopelessness. Arthur and Perry offer up the role of bickering couple and they flesh out the friends with their bantering about every little thing. In a moment where John spits in Perry's face, the proceeding moment between the lovers is full of anger and yet, as Perry is comforted by Arthur, love. Overall, this is a well done movie. The scenes at the lake are fun and full of eye candy moments. The moment where Buzz sparks a naked chain of events is actually hilarious and a near conclusion dance number (Swan Lake) is lovely and sad as each charater indicates when they die. This is a movie with it all... and all three attributes of the title are clearly displayed. This is definatly a movie worth watching... and it maintains its sense of fun and sadness through the actors amazing performances.",1104192000,2,2739,4.603271983640082

30619,3,0780620372,"Terrance McNally's LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! was a Tony-winning powerhouse on the New York stage--but the same cannot be said of the play's screen adaptation, which plays like a yuppie version of BOYS IN THE BAND that has unexpectedly collided with ON GOLDEN POND... but without much benefit to either.

The story itself concerns a group of eight gay men who meet at an isolated but lavish country house for summer weekends and who thrash out their various hopes, desires, and relationships in the process.  In this sort of ensemble piece, where the story is more about people than plot, the cast is key--and in truth the cast is quite fine, with John Glover a particular standout in the dual role of John and James Jeckyll.

Trouble is, the gifts of the cast are repeatedly undercut by some of the most uninspired direction and cinematography going, and after a while it all begins to acquire a strangely superficial quality.  I laughed now and then, I felt moved now and then, and I was occasionally impressed with some of the dramatic ideas involved.  But when the final credits rolled I felt the film as a whole lacked any significant impact.  The cast, however, makes it worth the effort.

30620,5,0780620372,"By Richard Valentine Reily, author of Gregory's Hero.
This is not a production for the close minded, or children.
Ramon returns from skinny dipping in the lake with only a big towel draped loosely over his shoulder, his short muscled body exhibiting all its Latin splendor. The show is on.
L!V!C! allows audiences a glimpse into the usually disdained world of every day gay life, giving them the opportunity to laugh nervously and to glance at their partner's responses. Once settled in, the production shows that gay and straight lives are roughly similar. This play is certainly reminiscent of The Big Chill.
Bobbie turns in a stunning performance as Gregory's blind lover. His hesitancy at movement, stammering articulation and resistance to pandering by his friends works. Not to mention his naked, practically hairless blond body, complete with a kneeling scene on the lake raft with his tight posterior pointed directly at the audience. Blindness obviously keeps him from visualizing his less than attractive lover.
Gregory is an over the hill choreographer who owns a fabulous country house to which the six friends retire on weekends from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Gregory is in search of his final routine, yet dispenses his energy in fear of Bobbie leaving him. In the end he finds his final piece while finding his body to fatigued to perform it. Thankfully, Gregory's nakedness is exposed only in the ending scene.
All the actors played their roles superbly.  Yet, in every production, one must shine (even more that Bobbie's gorgeous ass and Ramon's muscled body) and that one is the musical trivia champion, Buzz. With boundless energy, the flaming musical queen bounces about with wit and compassion. His act is a dramatic cover for his tragedy of living a loveless life with AIDS. Yet in the end, even he finds a purpose; caring for the cold and heartless John Jeckyll's brother James. James dissolves from a friendly, caring antithesis of John to soiling himself in a canoe.
Each of the characters and themes will touch the audience differently. Arthur and Perry touched me most closely as they showed me more of my relationship with each passing act. A humorous scene in their car on the way to the country house and a touching scene of each trimming the other's ear hairs, brings an insight of things gays really do together. Opposed to what some think we spend all our time doing.
In the beginning you may be edgy at the in your face frontal nudity. You will quickly settle into the fun and feeling of the production. Finally, you are left honestly and compassionately understandng many of the very questions, concerns and frustrations most gay men encounter in their search for meaning, and the end.",1088294400,9,2721,4.915217391304348
30621,5,0780620372,"This is a very touching and meanigful film about friendship and love.  One of the most important facts I like about this film is NO STEREOTYPES.  It's not the club scene or drugs,sex and not everyone is a queen.  It is a group of adult men who get together and share their lives.  Think of it as the gay ""BIG CHILL"".  One deals with loneliness and aids, two committed relationships go through infidelity and the stuggles of forgiveness.  Two gay brothers come to terms with their relationship.  The acting is well done especially John Glover who plays both brothers.  I highly recommend this.

Yes it is very over the top in some places, but it fits the characters, and there are some very dramatic camp queens out there, so I think this movie is an example of some gay men, but not all.  Just watch it and enjoy, don't get caught up in whether or not it is a representation of you personally.",1086220800,4,543,4.211538461538462
30623,2,0780620372,"""This is my house.  I like to fill it up with my friends....  [Sadly, I don't have any, so these are the miserable people I invited instead.]""  So paraphrases the opening voice-over of the screen adaptation of Terrence McNally's off-Broadway play.  Better it had remained off-Broadway.
LVC is a clear nod to Mart Crowley's 1968 off-Broadway ""Boys in the Band,"" likewise brought to the big screen in 1970.  Like its predecessor, LVC is premised on a gathering of eight disparate and self-loathing NYC gay men with seemingly no emotional bond between them.  Apparently the cultural stereotypes of the 1960's still live on in the 90's, as the group includes a choreographer prone to passive aggressive hissy fits, a bitchy theater queen, an air-headed pretty boy dancer, a whiny couple, and a tiresome yuppie (yes, he DOES tie pastel sweaters around his neck).  Similarly, both films include most of their original theater casts.  Even BITB's final scene of the partygoers line dancing to Martha Reeves and the Vandella's ""Heatwave"" is reprised in an oddly placed performance of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies from ""Nutcracker Suite.""  So with all this in common, what makes BITB a classic of gay cinema and LVC so laughably forgettable?
BITB, as repeated in so many gay retrospectives, hit the stage before the watershed Stonewall Riot of 1969.  It was a whisper before gay identity truly found its voice.  There is something compellingly sympathetic about this collection of men who hang together simply because they can be their uncloseted selves around each other.  Their bitchiness and self-loathing too must be viewed in the context of their repressive era.  This desperate need for camaraderie and acceptance, however, doesn't translate well to LVC and the 1990's.
Or maybe it's the film direction that sets them apart.  William Friedkin, who directed BITB, is no stranger to the screen nor to controversy.  His credits include ""The Exorcist,"" ""French Connection,"" ""Cruising,"" and ""To Live and Die in LA.""  Joe Mantello, by contrast played a couple bit parts in ""Law and Order"" in addition to directing LVC.  And LVC is hardly a groundbreaking movie.
Or maybe it's the actors.  The miscast Jason Alexander (Nathan Lane wisely declined the chance to repeat his stage role) leaves the audience expecting George Castanza's parents and Kramer to barge in at any time.  And I for one would rather have the skin peeled off my still living body than see Jason Alexander in a tutu again.
LVC does attempt to evoke emotional involvement with its inclusion of a character with AIDS.  He comes across, however, as a perfunctory toss-in and is rather unsympathetic, reminiscent of Kenneth Branagh's ""Peter's Friends"".  For films in which HIV is more engaging and integral to the storytelling, see ""Parting Glances"", ""Longtime Companion"", ""Grief"", or ""Opposite of Sex"".
It's very likely that LVC stages much better than it screens.  McNally, after all, wrote ""The Ritz,"" ""Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" ""Ragtime,"" and ""Frankie and Johnny,"" to deserved critical acclaim.  Indeed, the forced dialect (including the sappy final voice-over) is far more appropriate to theater than to cinema.",1076025600,10,3179,5.118217054263566
30624,4,0780620372,This was a good drama with comic scenes. The acting is exceptional and the films quality was great. It's a bit heavy and addresses the HIV issue however the main story is about the relationships these friends have and how they deal with life's challenges. It's a good film and deserves a look. Not a movie I would take a date to see but more a rainy day stay in and mellow out in front of the T.V. type film. Give it a look.,1068249600,,424,4.059523809523809
30625,5,0780620372,"I have not seen the stage version of this, but I have read the script.  I was really taken, never more so than by the relationships the characters have, with their partners and their friends.  The closeness is conveyed with a sensitivity that was unexpected.
Considering most of the performers were in the stage production, it seems natural they handle it so well.  John Glover was phenomenal as the twin brothers, and Jason Alexander...well, I never cared much for his ""Seinfeld"" character, and I could care less about most of the other stuff he's done.  But a well-done performance...I loved his hilarious naked romp, but even more his moment of introspection, his coming to grips with his illness and that terrible fear of who will be there for him when he needs someone?
All around, a film that inspired, and really got me.",1066867200,4,827,4.7622377622377625
30626,5,0780620372,"I thought this film was outstanding. I put it in a class with the film ""It's My Party"". It's a wonderful character study, and I only wish that I could be part of a group of friends (as described by the narrator, ""like a family"") like this. Of course, some of the characters could be described as stereotypical, but they're certainly not one-dimensional. This story is splendidly cast, and beautifully filmed. It's touching, sometimes funny, sometimes painful, sometimes campy, but very realistic. I found myself drawn into it, and felt as though I was there in that charming lakeside country house.",1025740800,7,598,4.930693069306931
30627,3,0780620372,"Characters are different stereotypes: the gay musical queen, the ""perfect yuppie couple"", the tormented pianist, the terminal aids character, the collected aging dancer with the handsome to dye for blind and cheating lover, the hispanic wannabe dancer.
At the end this movie has no point to it, you never learn to appreciate profundly any character, you never can see any depths in each of the relationships, and just learn some gossip about their lives, and how they eventually die. Perhaps many can relate to the charactyers in basic levels, but there is not much love or at least not very well expressed, not much sympathy either, and some compassion for both characters played by John Glover (perhaps the only real ""actor"" in this film).
Conclusion: the film is shallow superficial and with only some bright moments provided by J.G and a small scene with JG and Jason Alexander; the rest are just ordinary ""characters/actors"" who dropped by this countryhouse/film.",1011571200,,968,5.09433962264151
30628,1,0780620372,"One of the worst movies in recent years.  The actors try their best, but can't overcome the phoney, pretentious and mawkish screenplay.

30630,4,0780620372,"Though I'm without the benefit of having seen McNally's original play, it doesn't take a sleuth to figure out this story was meant for the stage. That kind of live performance would certainly help viewers to accept the 'over the top' drama that unfolds in L!V!C!, often with the subtlety of road rage. The men in this film all seem to be railing against the destruction of their lives and/or their relationships.  Though this film is packed with PC moralizing and good-intentioned monologues, the witty script does a fair job of alleviating much of the emotional gloom and doom.  The film's climax is (unfortunately) treated in arty seriousness, and plays like a gimmick to wring-out a few more tears after so much breast-beating.
The dialogues and emotional exchanges in L!V!C! are, for the most part, sincere and not affected. Jason Alexander is a marvel as ""the little horror under the stairs,"" a far-cry from (Seinfeld's) George Costanza. Critics who belittle this part as ""stereotypical"" are overlooking the obvious: even depressed Opera Queens have stories to share. John Glover reprises his Tony winning dual role and provides this film's standout performance. The supporting cast is visually appealing, if not entirely memorable.
The structure of the story (as told over the course of several Summer weekends) is a slight detriment, in that it prevents viewers from seeing the characters in their respective haunts. That means that each of them winds up having to face his inner demons/turmoil because someone else in the group effects a challenge. No alliance is ""safe"" from harm or change, which makes the interplay fascinating to watch.
I guess whether or not you enjoy this film depends on your personal tolerance level for high drama. There is no linear storyline per se, but rather a sense of evolution, toward resignation or acceptance depending on the character. Despite the insular nature of the subject matter, there are plenty of humorous and genuinely moving moments to make the film accessible to a variety of viewers.
Incidentally, a DVD release of this film is overdue.

I laughed and cried and thought it was a work of art.  At  first when I realized it was a movie about gay men I thought, ""Oh no  not another movie about AIDS"",and indeed Aids was there but it only  really hovered in the background for most of the film.  The characters were  quite believable and I laughed and cried and fell in love with this brave  and intelligent film.  The movie which comes to mind when I try to find a  comparrison is, ""Smoke signals""  which is not about gays or aids  or anything but life love and relationships and co-incidentally American  Indians.
