8102522,5,B000DINBKK,"What could make Madagascar better except for the cinnamony voice of Maya Angelou narrating?

If ONLY she could have included one of her brilliant poems such as: Mad-a-gas-car / You are the light on the ebony continent / The blackest pearl in the ocean of lament/ Fertile / Fecund / Fantastical / What does the lemur say as he eats the bread fruit wrought on the back of the slave of yore?/ Oh, Madagascar / Sing your goodness while we drink your sun and baobab elixir.",1392336000,,468,4.441860465116279
8102523,5,B000DINBKK,I was hesitant to get this Video because it was put out by Readers Digest. I thought it would not be good BUT I have found this is the best video I've found so far. It also comes with a little booklet. The closeups are fantastic and a closeup chase by a Fossa and Lemur you will never see anywhere else I think. The Fossa is a nocturnal animal so there are never any good photos of this animal. This video has great pictures of the Fossa.,1390608000,,438,4.045977011494253
