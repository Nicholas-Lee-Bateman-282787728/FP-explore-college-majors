8052292,4,B0007VS6TO,"My mom is 83 years young, and she absolutely loves this tape. This is her third one, because for some reason they don't last.
I offered to buy her other exercise tapes, but this is the one that works for her.",1406505600,,208,4.097560975609756
8052293,1,B0007VS6TO,most of the video was garbled and not able to follow. I would not recommend it. I bought two of them and they were both garbled.,1387411200,,128,3.9615384615384617
8052294,5,B0007VS6TO,This video is fun and at a great pace to get back in to caring for your body. The videos inserted between the exercises give one time to catch their breath. The spots that the various exercises tone are explained in detail.,1319500800,,223,4.333333333333333
8052295,3,B0007VS6TO,"This video is a little corny (okay, it's a LOT corny), but it is very inspiring to see these seniors working out with weights.  Clyde does a good job explaining the exercises and their benefits, and there is a music and old time video interlude while you do the reps.  Sometimes there is TOO much time for the reps, and sometimes there isn't enough and you wish you could stop it so you can continue the exercise before moving on.  Probably not the best video of this kind, but I think it was the first and Clyde should get some credit for showing older people that fitness is still achieveable.",1167696000,8,595,4.390909090909091
