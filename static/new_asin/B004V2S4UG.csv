8442744,3,B004V2S4UG,"Every single one of these DVDs I got already are stalling. I have one of the DVDS (We love our friends) that I got from Target and it stopped working after 2 times of watching it and all of these are doing the same thing now. It will stall so much I either have to rewind or go to the next episode on the disc. I love the shows and I love watching them with my 2 year old but the company they use clearly has issues in the way they pack these disc or make them. Either way, it is quite annoying.",1362614400,,495,3.8155339805825244
