While I don't subscribe to all of Poppa Neutrino's beliefs I truly envy and admire his sense of adventure and originality. I love his thoughts about rent and how that keeps the masses in check - interesting point to explore in more depth. Anyhow, long after I watched the film the songs from the soundtrack by Ingrid Lucia (his daughter) are still playing in my head. I ended  up buying a few of the songs off of iTunes. This film is a gem!",1296432000,,592,4.481481481481482
8372453,5,B002L6HAL8,After meeting Ingrid this past spring in New Orleans I found this movie is very facinating. She is one of my favorite musicians. It's interesting to see how her childhood truly shaped who she is today.  This will be one of the very few movies that I will watch over and over again!,1289088000,,281,4.30188679245283
8372454,4,B002L6HAL8,"Random Lunacy: Videos from the Road Less Traveled (2007) is a great documentary following the life of William David Pearlman (more commonly know as Poppa Neutrino) and his family. Seamlessly splicing many interviews with home videos draws you into his life and teachings in an amazing way.

Poppa Neutrino chose a life of freedom by bucking the traditional lifestyle and goals of most. People with little knowledge of him could consider him a failure until they watch this film. You will learn how his life, however difficult (by choice), is extremely rich and fulfilling. The adventures he and his family have been on, places he has seen, people met, things learned, and that he even taught will make any wealthy person jealous.

8 out of 10 - I really enjoyed the unique adventure that the filmmakers Stephanie Silber and Victor Zimet created. Their style made the documentary very engrossing; even with the interesting subject it could have been like watching a boring home movie, but their vision and storytelling abilities shine and make Random Lunacy a real treat!
