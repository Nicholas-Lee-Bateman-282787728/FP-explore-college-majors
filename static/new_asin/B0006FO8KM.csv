8041347,5,B0006FO8KM,"Love this show, the show really captures their beautiful bond it brings me back to middle school when I first saw them and fell in love with them as a couple, too bad they're not together anymore although they are very good friends still and speak highly of each other to this day. The wedding was gorgeous and the whole planning of it was super entertaining, definitely recommend for those that aren't into the cookie cutter lifestyles, they are def. living on the edge in this and I love it!",1389744000,,493,4.488888888888889
8041348,4,B0006FO8KM,"I saw this show on MTV when it was still prime time and when they were still very much in love. It's a good show I would put it right up there with The NewlyWeds. I think the price is ridiculous though but someone will buy it only because if you have never seen it, it is intriguing and you honestly can't find it anywhere. It's NewlyWeds Goth style!",1263427200,3,350,4.086956521739131
