8530632,5,B0002DVA3Q,"Tommy Walker was more popular around 2003, but even today this DVD is a great example of the unique worship music that Tommy wrote during this period. As an artist he has a unique voice that is easy to listen to and fun to watch. Tommy surrounds himself with a variety of very talented musicians from backup singers to the synth player or the Hammond B3 guy. Your worship team can learn alot about the art and ministry of performing in a worship environment. Tommy sets the standard for singer - songwriter - worship leader - performer. NO matter what your music taste this is a must watch DVD. I bought it for the first time when Integrity Music first recorded it, since then I've loaned it so many times taht I recently had to buy another copy. I still watch this DVD on a regular bases.",1352246400,,789,4.374149659863946
