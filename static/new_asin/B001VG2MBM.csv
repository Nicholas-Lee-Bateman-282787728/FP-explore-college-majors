8346277,1,B001VG2MBM,"This is nothing other than a repackaging of ""Morrissey:  A Jewel In The Crown.""  If you own that DVD (and if you're a hardcore Moz fan you probably do,) then skip this - it's the EXACT same thing.

The description is misleading, there is no rare performance footage.  In fact, the first 5 seconds of the film clearly state there is no Morrissey music at all in the entire film.  Features long, drawn-out interviews with people who worked with Moz on his records.

If you are a serious Moz fan and don't already own ""Jewel In The Crown,"" you may want to consider this, but you'll probably end up only watching it once.  There are no revelations in this.",1246838400,21,652,4.428571428571429
