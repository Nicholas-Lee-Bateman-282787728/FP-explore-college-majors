8470268,1,B004UFE2VE,Was going to buy it but u don't have it in region 1 which is us DVD players. Have seen quite a few of Audie Murphy movies that we cant get because not made for us DVD players what a shame!!!,1446422400,,190,3.658536585365854
8470269,5,B004UFE2VE,"The rating is just for the movie itself and not for the Non- USA format. This is just one of many Audie Murphy Westerns that are not available on Region 1(USA) or Blueray.  As another reviewer for Hell Bent for Leather stated they cant wait for Destry as well.  These are among the better Audie Murphy films that are rare and only come on cable once in blue moon. I remember seeing Destry on cable (TCM???) about 10 yrs ago as well as Ride Clear of Diablo, Sever Ways from Sundown etc. These are only played very sparingly for some reason on TCM and AMC channels and if you're lucky they will play it on Encore Western station once a year. I know this because its not available on demand in their movie library at all. In fact I rarely seen any of Audie Murphys played on that station which is strange due to the fact that this channel is supposed to have the largest database of all Westerns ever made. Even more sad is when a good one is on it is between11pm - 6am. So make plenty of room for your DVR or other recorder.",1436313600,,1022,4.182741116751269
8470270,1,B004UFE2VE,"Thank, again correct movie, WRONG REGIONAL CODE (101)!  I will return the DVD and am requesting it be replaced with one for U.S. or a REFUND (17.99).  I really would prefer the movie.",1434758400,3,183,4.515151515151516
8470271,1,B004UFE2VE,"Did realize it wouldn't play in my zone -- might be a great movie, but I'll never know.",1414972800,,87,3.888888888888889
8470272,5,B004UFE2VE,Yes it met my expectations and more.  Highly recommended.,1404345600,,57,5.333333333333333
