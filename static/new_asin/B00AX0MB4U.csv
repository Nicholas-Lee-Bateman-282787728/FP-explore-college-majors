Unfortunately this disc would not play on my US blu-ray player. The description says compatible with Regions A/B/C but that is false. It caused an error on my player about incompatible resolution. So I have to now search for a true Region A or Region Free disc.",1525392000,,403,4.855072463768116

8558677,3,B00AX0MB4U,"According to this movie, all you need to fall in love is wanting to. Seduction is easy and dialogues simplistic, which leaves you thinking that they should have spent more time in framing the story. It all feels light and inconsequential. The girl's particular change of heart is the weakest point in this hollow story.",1455667200,,319,4.818181818181818

8558681,5,B00AX0MB4U,"Life alone isn't easy, with two its complicated. These words of wisdom
pretty much sums up ""The Angels of Sex"". A very well fleshed out
character study about several complicated relationship between three
people who refuse for conform to society's expectations, yet they
themselves struggle to surpass their own limitations of how love and
sex should be handled without prejudice. The film unspools the lives
and loves of Rai (lvaro Cervantes), Carla (Astrid Bergs-Frisbey) &
Bruno (Lloren Gonzlez) three hipsters who are dealing with the
current realities of modern Spain, both in personal & professional
relations. All three characters suffer distinct challenges and
pleasures of life as their personalities are interwoven in meticulously
yet naturally planned situations which tests their patience for what
they are willing to tolerate from one another. As angels may be, do we
really know what sex they are? In this film, boundaries established by
preconceived notions are of least importance as the heart wants what
the heart needs. Filmmaker Xavier Villaverde flawlessly handles the
character's in several surreal situations giving them enough material
to allow for the realities of some very complex situations that are
compounded by mixed feelings with ever more confusing results. This
movie is a must see for three good reasons, Rai, Bruno & Carla. As they
co-mingle and fuse their sentiments towards one another, One can't help
wondering how long would a relationship of this sort really last, but
as we see sexual desires and true love and pain surface, we realize
that these are only people looking for the same thing... to be loved as
intensely as the heart and flesh may permit for one never knows what,
when or how long the good times may last. A film highly recommended for
its embrace and truthful storytelling depicting an alternative
situation beautifully performed with profound meaning and
dedication. You are in for a treat as your eyes will feast on this
deliciously, tasty & sweet love triangle. With the many temperature
rising scenes presenting sexual fluidity at its best, thankfully this
dish is best served hot courtesy of our main cast and their charismatic
& overwhelming chemistry.",1363564800,,2214,5.204481792717087
8558682,3,B00AX0MB4U,I was expecting a spanish language film with spanish subtitles - this is one of my must-haves. What I got was a film with about 1/3 of the dialog in catalan. The spanish subtitles were only available for the dialog that was catalan.,1360281600,,232,4.4186046511627906
8558683,5,B00AX0MB4U,I LOVED this movie! Stumbled upon it by a happy accident and was thrilled to find it! It is very seductive and alive with energy and explores love and sexuality and how these characters refuse to be limited in their lives and how they express that love. It's very realistic and the acting and writing is very good and the look of the movie has high production values and great direction! I love indie films because they are brave enough to explore themes you rarely see in main stream films. Alvaro Cervantes who plays Rai is poised for stardom and he could seduce anyone into falling in love with him. Highly recommend this film!!,1358380800,3,631,4.543859649122807
