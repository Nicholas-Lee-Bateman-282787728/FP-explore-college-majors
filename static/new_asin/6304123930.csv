7862338,5,6304123930,John Burbidge was a designer who made mannequins (historical dolls) dressed in his excellently fashioned costumes of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.  The costumes are detailed and accurate and an absolute pleasure to see.  This film is a presentation of his work - which is also a traveling display at museums.  Mr Burbidge sometimes gives workshops.  I would have loved to take one.  I'm glad I got to see the tape.,1197158400,,418,4.830985915492958
