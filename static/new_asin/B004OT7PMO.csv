4441125,1,B004OT7PMO,I'd give this less than 1 star if I could. It's insulting. There are hundreds of great buddy movies with guys but put two women as the buddies and you get : two idiots who make one bad decision after another and then kill themselves......,1392768000,7,238,4.311111111111111
4441126,5,B004OT7PMO,"Thelma and Louise is one of my all time favorites. The soundtrack and cinematography will not fail to bring on an urge to drive across the country.

4441142,4,B004OT7PMO,"Most of this film is excellent. The metaphor at the end (I don't want to spoil it on the rare chance of anyone not knowing the ending) is beautifully shot, but I found it an unbelievable ending besides being a downer. There were so many ways this could have worked out, and I believe Sarandon's character would have been smart enough to figure that out. It's such an iconic movie, it is a must see. And no, not all the male characters in the film are creeps. There are too many reviews here by people who didn't see the movie, but feel they have to whine about it anyway.",1516752000,,571,4.247706422018348

4441158,1,B004OT7PMO,"This movie is filled with anti-male cliche stereotypes and encourages violence as a solution -- it's an alternate reality from a hate-cult feminist mindset where the world is set up to oppress women. It's the kind of movie gender studies professors show their students as ""evidence"" of an anti-female world in order to help build the continuing villainization of anything male in society. Setting aside the fact that it's drenched in sexist and hateful messages, the acting was at the beginning of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon's career when they were first learning to act well, and it shows. The only redeeming part of the film was that these two sexist and hateful characters drove themselves off a cliff. Thankfully that means there won't be a sequel.",1515283200,,756,4.960629921259843

4441162,2,B004OT7PMO,"This is one of those movies that I never saw when it came out, but have been hearing references to it for years.  I finally decided to see it for myself, and learn firsthand what all the excitement has been about.  I can only conclude that this has got to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen.

One of the things I really hate in a movie is when the whole storyline is driven by the premise that the protagonists are idiots who compound whatever bad situation they've gotten themselves into by heaping ever more bad decisions on top of the ones that got them in trouble to begin with.  Well, that's basically the whole ""Thelma & Louise"" story in a nutshell.  It has a downright stupid script that has the characters doing things that make no logical sense whatsoever.  Add to that, some of the performances feature some of the worst acting outside of a TV sitcom.

On the plus side, there was some beautiful scenery.",1509062400,,930,4.435294117647059
4441163,4,B004OT7PMO,"I watched this movie after reading the book that came out over the summer that talked about the making of the movie and what a groundbreaking movie it was. Two female stars, an unknown female screenwriter, a quirky film director, and characters that depicted woman and men in a different non-conventional way. This film does not generate neutrality. Viewers are either horrified by the violence depicted in the film or screaming for a finally realistic portrayal of the lives woman lead in this country thats less than the dutiful wife.

Although Director Ridley Scott may go a little overboard (exploding truck anyone)? I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie quite like it in both style and substance and Hollywood has largely opted not to repeat the success of this type of story. Opting instead for Superhero franchises, and [insert name of franchise part 57]. It is both breathtaking in terms of story and cinematography that the film stays in your head for hours, days, and weeks after youve watched it.",1508198400,2,1019,4.85632183908046

This movie speaks for the power of fate and how people interact with it; it is also a really funny movie, I found myself rooting for the bad girls. The ending is worth watching the whole movie; guaranteed to blow your mind. Wow, incredible. Ha ha ha ha ha ha oh man, I'm still laughing and thoroughly amazed.",1497571200,,467,4.63855421686747
4441187,5,B004OT7PMO,"I  love  this  movie.
It  starts  off  with  someone  trying  to  rape  Thelma  near  the  beginning  then  Louise  kills  the  guy.
I  think  he  was  a  cook  at  the  restaurant  they  were  at  or  something.  After  that  they  just  pack  up  &  hit  the  road.
&  they  make  a  name  for  themselves,  &  they're  prepared  to  defend  their  honor  as  well.  They  rob  convenient  stores,  pickup  a  hitchhiker  (Brad Pitt)  that  Thelma  has  taken  a  liking  to.  He  robs  them  one  night  during  their  absence,  &  eventually  has  to  face  the  police.  I  liked  his  attitude,  (Just  mostly  acting  cool  &  being  what  he  is  in  this  movie  immature).  Thelma's  husband  wants  her  to  come  back  home  immediately  instead  of  running  around  with  another  man,  but  she  doesn't  being  as  it  is  it  would  have  been  risky.  They  got  a  detective  who's  determined  that  they  turn  themselves  in,  but  they  refuse  to.  &  when  the  highway  patrol  pulls  them  over  in  (The  middle  of  nowhere)  They  think  its  time  to  face  justice,  until  Louise  locks  him  in  the  trunk  &  shoots  the  police  radio.  I  loved  that  part!
They  also  play  a  rotten  prank  with  the  Truck driver  they  were  running  into  on  the  open  road  a  lot.  &  he  wanted  to  play,  but  he's  soon  rejected,  &  gets  his  rig  blown  up.  I  always  thought  that  was  pretty  funny.  I  didn't  really  feel  sorry  for  him.  It  was  my  guess  that  they  didn't  trust  anybody  because  they  didn't  want  to  be  taken  advantage  of  by  any  man.
Soon  after  there's  about  60  cops  after  them  that  almost  get  them  cornered,  but  for  these  2  girls  they  decide  to  have  their  ride  to  victory......  &  go  off  into  the  (Grand Canyon)",1496275200,,1826,4.309278350515464

I remember watching this years ago with no expectations. I had heard it was good, directed by Ridley Scott, and starred Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. What I got was sharing the road with two of the most memorable women on film. The chemistry, the bonding, and their adventure will make you wish you could be there with them. Along the way, they encounter some soon-to-be-big movie stars, road trip shenanigans, and life-changing events that shape their decisions.

Most of the men in this movie are just goofy caricatures of what some people imagine ""male pigs"" to be.  It's a bit over the top, if not, granted, entertaining.  Even if a man were to rape a woman, which I'm not denying happens of course, he wouldn't do it in a crowded parking lot bending her over a car bumper where any of 300 patrons in the bar is going to walk right by sometime while the woman is crying ""no no"".  99.99999 % of men will stop when a woman says no, especially the way Louise did in the movie, even when drinking.  But, it certainly set the frame for an interesting story

It seems however, to balance out with good male characters like Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel.

Having said all of that, I did enjoy the movie and thought it was a well done film.  Ridley Scott is no doubt one of the best contemporary directors around.",1463616000,,944,4.205555555555556

4441429,5,B004OT7PMO,"""Thelma and Louise"" is an epic movie. The plot line involves two women who escape their everyday lives, and husband in Thelma's case, to venture to a mountain cabin for a couple of days. Along the way, they make a stop at a bar, where Thelma is almost raped. Louise, being the protective friend she is, shoots the man. He then calls out after them, and Louise fires again, killing him. Since nobody would believe Thelma's claim of attempted rape and Louise is wanted for murder, the duo heads west and plans to escape to Mexico. The story is pretty heavy, simply based on its premise. However, the plot is lightened with beautiful scenery, and the smiles and laughs shared by the two best friends. Along their journey, they rob a convenience store, lock a police man in his trunk, and blow up the truck of a man who repeatedly makes obscene gestures at them. Not only do these scenes follow the theme of feminism, but they are also absolutely hilarious! Thelma and Louise are the type of people you want to be friends with, and you cannot help but wish you are sitting in the back of their car. They are cool, independent, and hilarious women, despite their circumstances. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to cry, laugh, and leave feeling empowered.",1449446400,2,1266,4.606194690265487

Anyways, the protagonists were both very likable anti-heroes and their wild ride through the south/southwest was fun.  I thought both Geena's and Susan's performances were wonderful and quite believable for the most part, and despite all they played extremely sympathetic characters (this was not a mistake I'm guessing - the duality between crime and cause of said, whether the cause can justify the crime, etc...).  It was also EXTREMELY enjoyable to see the dirtbag rapist get shot and the various other sexist pigs in this movie get put in their place, not to mention when Thelma ""crosses-over"" and robs that store.

And for all those censorship-loving fascists out there, this is a MOVIE, a fictional on-screen portrayal of a great story - not a blueprint for living life in the real world.  Pretty much all of the violent crime committed by Thelma & Louise was not only necessary for their survival in-plot but also crucial to the overarching feminist theme - in effect throwing a small wrench in the huge gears that are our man's world.",1408147200,2,1319,4.8097345132743365

4441630,4,B004OT7PMO,"THELMA AND LOUISE is a great movie about two women who set out on a weekend vacation, but end up becoming two fugitives on the run across the American southwest. The acting is wonderful. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have never had finer performances and the supporting ""male"" cast does just as fine a job (not only was this the film that made Brad Pitt a star, this also was the movie that jump-started Harvey Keitel's career). After his success with ALIEN, Ridley Scott made a few lackluster films before striking the goldmine again with THELMA AND LOUISE. Just about everything he did with the movie illustrates how talented of a filmmaker he is, from the vista views to the soundtrack to the casting to the closing scene.

Nevertheless, with all the wonderful things about the film, the movie is simply a buddy flick, but with women instead of men. A buddy flick about two women had really never quite been done before and the film did cause some controversy. It is also true that the film touches upon broad topics and social issues such as rape, justice, and what it means to be free (freedom always comes with a price tag). The film also has a great soundtrack and some awesome visuals of the American southwest. Still when you drain the memorable melodies and take all the pretty pictures away, the film remains at the core as simply just another buddy flick. A really good buddy flick, but a buddy flick nonetheless.",1402099200,,1426,4.636363636363637

When you find that best friend that you know you will have their back no matter what, you have found a friend for life. I saw myself getting mad at the stupid decisions that Louise kept making . Thelma never threw these bad decisions back in her face, but she did make it very clear that they were bad decisions. This showed a real friendship. The type of friendship where you can get mad at each other, but the other person realizes that they did make a bad decision and you both get over it.

I see this movie not only as a road trip adventure film, but a sort of ""coming-of-age"" for the character Louise. Her journey is real and her coming into own is inspiring.

Excellent cast.",1394668800,,122,4.809523809523809
4441707,5,B004OT7PMO,the gender differentiation still holds up over 20 years later - this movie is sad and funny all at the same time.,1394668800,6,113,4.181818181818182
4441708,5,B004OT7PMO,"I originally saw this movie when it first came out and it was definitely worth watching it again.  I had forgotten Brad Pit was in this movie and for those that like him it was a nice surprise.  The movie had good Action, Adventure and some Drama.  I will probably end up buying the file at some point. It's a keeper.",1394582400,,317,4.163934426229508
4441709,3,B004OT7PMO,"It was a bit too long and drawn out for my taste but all in all it was ok.  I wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend it since it wasn't anything to ""write home about"".",1394582400,,175,3.861111111111111
4441710,5,B004OT7PMO,"Had not watched this in a while, I had really forgotten what a good movie it is. Glad I watched it again and good music too, Glenn Frey always a hit!",1394409600,,149,3.838709677419355

4441712,5,B004OT7PMO,"What should probably be remembered as a depressing movie is, instead, empowering. Good girls gone ""bad"" and  becoming more themselves as they journey. From meek and obedient to strong, defiant, vulnerable, real and tragic. Somehow and some way also inspiring. Loved this movie when it first came out and all these years later I love it still.",1394236800,14,342,5.0
4441713,5,B004OT7PMO,"I really liked this movie.  It showed the strength of one woman with the passion of wanting to rescue and help another woman, a friend to be a stronger woman but, somehow it all became so messed up and the ending was terribly tragic.  There are no heroes in this movie, no winners.  The movies was put together very well, had meaning, and theme.  This movie can yank-your-chain, rouse your anger and make you cry.  Good watch to see.",1394150400,,433,4.430379746835443

4441715,5,B004OT7PMO,"Every 3 or 4 years it's fun to watch this movie. It's basically very sad and not that far out of touch. Hopefully these days that wouldn't happen and if it did, it would be be tempting to go off the cliff rather than face all those angry men. Either way is going to hurt bad. It's always fun to see a young Brad Pitt before he was famous.",1393977600,,338,3.9130434782608696

4441722,5,B004OT7PMO,"I only watched this movie because we talked about it in one of my classes. I thought it would be kind of cheesy, but I watched it anyway because I was bored. I can't even believe it's taken me this long to see it! It's definitely one of my favorite movies now. I feel completely inspired.",1393545600,,288,4.160714285714286

4441725,5,B004OT7PMO,"I love this movie for many reasons ... Thelma , was in a bad marriage , she was young when she married and didn't really get to live a full fun life because she always had to answer to her husband and had to stay in the house all the time . Louise , had lived a life ... And she had a bad past that she was trying to leave behind her . Even though Thelma and Louise were two different people and looked at things completely different they were best friends ... And I do have to say these girls went out with a bang . They knew they would go to jail ... ( Even though they should have went to the police first and they probably would have gotten self defence ) but they had fun their last few days and they left the world happy I would say . These two women are incredible in my opinion .",1393545600,,787,3.834355828220859
4441726,5,B004OT7PMO,"Great movie...makes me want to be a delinquent. Just kidding. The only thing, if you quit smoking recently, wait awhile, because Thelma and Louise, and Jimmy chain smoke thru the whole movie, and although I didn't start again, I thought about a smoke.",1393459200,,251,4.8604651162790695
4441727,5,B004OT7PMO,"Like Braveheart, Dances With Wolves, Last of the Mohicans and Dr. Zhivago, Thelma and Louise is a movie I have seen so many times that I can recite the dialogue and yet is so glorious that I never get tired of watching it. It's arguably one of the best road movies ever made and unusual in that the two protagonists are female. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis gave the performances of their lives - and so became iconic.

When independent waitress Louise and her downtrodden housewife friend Thelma take a vacation to a mountain cabin, mayhem ensues. Stopping for a drink in a country western bar, Thelma steps out to get some air and is almost raped by a local thug. Louise shoots him and the two women become outlaws heading towards Mexico. Along the way, Louise, with her tortured past, becomes softer and more vulnerable while Thelma casts off her southern girlishness and gets bad to the bone.

Harvey Keitel as the compassionate cop, Michael Madsen as Louise's sexy yet commitment shy musician boyfriend, Brad Pitt as Thelma's bad ass one night stand  give stand out performances. Christopher McDonald, particularly, shines as Darryl, Thema's pig of a husband, and is absolutely hilarious.

Beautifully written, poignant, funny and thrilling--if you haven't seen it yet [or for a long time]--it's a must. I know that's what I'll be doing tonight! More than five stars.",1393459200,22,1373,4.879828326180258
4441728,4,B004OT7PMO,"Another movie I had never seen in its entirety until now. Good movie except for the end, but enjoyed it.",1393459200,,104,4.25
4441729,4,B004OT7PMO,"Good story, It has it all// funny, sad, tragic love/ Classic chick flick with a twist.. Guys will even like it. I did..",1393459200,,119,4.217391304347826
4441730,5,B004OT7PMO,Great film..  better quality! A classic movie that I love to watch.. oh it's also the movie that put Brad Pitt on map!,1393459200,,118,4.130434782608695
4441731,4,B004OT7PMO,"Saw it on prime and noticed it had been a long, long time since I saw this strong woman movie.  Always enjoyed it.  Still do.",1393372800,,125,3.96
4441732,5,B004OT7PMO,"In the many years that have passed since this film was released, there has been an incredible derth of films where strong, assertive female leads have been featured.  Granted this is a very sad story that still (unfortunately) resonates today. It seems that the only producers/director(s) that have written or chosen such stories is a trendsetter like Miyazaki, and of course that is animated films.  It is the 21st century Hollywood...what is the problem?
If not for such films-to-movies of young adult stories like The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, we would have nothing out there.  Thank God for Jennifer Lawrence - a fresh face with a wickedly honest personality who does not feel the need to be too meek and agreeable...and I suppose...typically feminine.",1393372800,,762,5.08
4441733,5,B004OT7PMO,"No Matter how many years go by since this movie was released, the fun these girls have will shock you and make you laugh. Watched this with my 22yr old  daughter and seeing a telephone booth, small town gas stations and dinners brought up great conversations for us. In one of the beginning scenes we almost cried for Thelma, but soon the journey began and we felt like friends being taken along on their trip.",1393372800,,410,4.466666666666667

4441736,1,B004OT7PMO,I had always heard this was a great movie but I ended up turning it off after about 30 minutes.  It is not worth your time!,1393286400,3,123,3.730769230769231
4441737,5,B004OT7PMO,"Thelma and Louise is what most women, who have been raped feel like all of their lives.  Husbands who  do not understand what a Woman has gone through and women who do not understand, because they were not raped.  Guess what it can happen to any woman and in our society we have seen this happening, also to men.

You must remember at the time this was made, so many women were afraid to come forward if raped.  Many live with this horror the rest of their lives unless they find help or want help to take way those nightmares.  The story is well written and direction of the movie was perfect to make this a block buster movie for all times. Directed by Ridley Scott and written by Callie Khouri.

Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Harvey Keitel as well as Michael Madsen were the perfect actors for their roles.  Especially character actor Christopher McDonald.  The people that Thelma and Lousie meet are characters we all have run across at sometime in our lives, One character in particular no other than Brad Pitt a first role for him, as a very young man who is out to take what he wants from anyone.  The characters were like some I have met in my travels and if you have traveled the open roads you know what I mean.  The Good and the Bad are part of humanity, we just need to be aware of our surroundings and beware of strangers in general.

An Adult movie for a Friday or Saturday night to very much enjoy.

4441743,3,B004OT7PMO,"I really identified with this film when it first came out.  And parts of it hold up well.  Some really bravura scenes, emotional truth.  But---there's the stupid factor.  Geena Davis' character is just so avoidably dumb and stupid that it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for their predicament.  She's one of those archetypical people that, while lovable and sweet, are just so stupid that they suck other lives into their orbits like a black hole.  There are so many ways these two could have handled themselves, but every dumb move they could make, they did.  As a now 64-year veteran of life, this feminist has a lot less sympathy for avoidable stupidity than the 40 year-old who watched this movie when it first came out.  But the acting, direction and script are first rate and the last scene is an absolute hope-to-die classic.",1393027200,,833,4.696551724137931
