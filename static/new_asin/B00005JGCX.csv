7938621,1,B00005JGCX,"BUYERS BEWARE: THIS IS A 2-DISC DVD-R RELEASE.
The `In Amazing Malavision Color!' are just tinted scenes added to the original film and the film hasn't been`Digitally remastered' in any way that I can see if you already have a copy of the film. As for the Widescreen version, you can get the same effect if you play your full screen version in the zoom mode on your remote control on a 1.69:1 screen.
I like this movie, but at the price listed, it's a total rip-off!",1256601600,15,466,4.367816091954023

7938623,1,B00005JGCX,"Worst quality dvd I have ever viewed. The picture is quality isn't even as good as a vhs recording from tv.
The color version is just recorded in b+w with a purple tint over the whole picture for a few minutes, then
 green tint, then yellow tint.",1226880000,19,246,4.23404255319149
7938624,1,B00005JGCX,"They took the FLASH GORDON serial, 13 chapters of non-stop laughs, thrills, sexy drama, and excitement, carved it down to featurette length, slashed the tops and bottom of the screen off to make it ""widescreen"", and then colorized it. And they're charging MONEY for it. Yes, they're asking you to PAY them to sit and look at garbage. Come to my house. I will let you look at my garbage for nothing. Well, okay, not the wastebasket in my bedroom. That's where I throw my torn underwear. Weirdo.",1222214400,26,493,4.613636363636363
7938625,5,B00005JGCX,"This is the real thing. Space ships were works of art and riveted together. You can walk in space without special suits. The monsters are all obvious fakes and the acting is bad. I think this is the best memory of my youth that I have come accross, very glad it has been preserved. My grandchildren love watching it with me, they see it through my eyes my children are to MATURE to enjoy it or admit they enjoy it.",1166400000,4,414,4.1875
