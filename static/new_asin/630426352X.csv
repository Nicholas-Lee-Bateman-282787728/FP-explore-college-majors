825194,5,630426352X,I own the video...hilarious. I want the DVD because it will be so much better. The video captured every angle of the band and the DVD will do a far better job perfecting the already perfect video. I have seen them 6 times in concert and the video gives an accurate description of what it is all bout. BUY IT!,1006300800,,308,4.15
825195,5,630426352X,"This 311 video is awesome!  I have friends that love this video- but they don't like 311.  So, it's entertaining even if (God forbid) you're not a fan.  I bought this video back in '98 and I still watch it on a regular basis.  For anyone that goes to 311 shows, it's a great video to watch the night before the show. It gets us super stoked.  I've met 311, they're really nice/fun guys.  If you haven't met 311, buy this video, it lets you in on just a little bit of how the guys REALLY are.  It's a fun video every fan should enjoy.",1005177600,2,533,4.019047619047619
825196,5,630426352X,"Enlarged To Show Detail(or ETSD) is an essential 311 fan item. If you are a core fan, you already own this video(hopefully), but if you are thinking about buying it, do it, you  won't regret it. The video features backstage footage(toking,goofing around), funny interviews, studio footage, live performances, videos, and goofing around in between shows. It is hilarious and if you toke, you will be amazed at certain parts of the video. Overall it is a 5-star video so buy it now, and when ETSD 2 comes out in November 01', but it too!...",995673600,2,538,4.723404255319149
825197,5,630426352X,"In this video band 311 shows us what really goes on back stage at their electrifying concerts.  They show everything for concert footage to back stage. They even show us their new single ""Down"".  This is a must see for any 311 fan or any real music fan for that matter. The number one video of the year!",983232000,,303,4.206896551724138
825198,5,630426352X,"311 is the greatest band ever , and this video made me love them even more . this video shows that 311 is not just your regular band, their music style , and their always staying true to their fans , will always be the reasons they are my favorite band in universe. with everything said, GET THIS MOVIE , IT""S AWESOME !",975024000,,319,4.079365079365079
825199,2,630426352X,"I love 311, so I was naturally psyched to see this video on the counter of the record store.  I had just bought the ""Who then Now?"" Korn home video, and was expecting just as great a documentary.
Whoops.  When I took a class on filmmaking in college, I learned that the main rule for a successful documentary is this: do NOT have the filmmaker featured in the flim!!  ""Enlarged.."" violates this rule repeatedly and flagrantly, and that moronic interviewer spoils what could be an awesome documentary.  The scenes of 311 performing live are awesome, as are the backstage shots and the post-show shots.  The interview segments are horrible, where the camera shows the interviewer as often as it shows the band members.  There are also several weak question-and-answer segments, with lame questions about superficial things instead of about the most impressive aspect of 311: THE MUSIC.
This video is hampered badly by the interviewer and the directorial style.  I love 311,  but I could barely stomach this video one time through.  The makers of this movie should go watch ""Who then Now?"" and see how you REALLY make a documentary about a band:  you don't ask them dumb questions, you ask them pertinant questions.  Don't show the filmmaker, keep him in the background.  Make the movie about the _band_.  Show us how they interact when they're at home and relaxing.  Show us how they prepare to go onstage, etc etc...
The best thing about ""Enlarged..."" was the song ""Gap"" on the CD that came with it.",974678400,4,1498,4.778210116731517
825200,5,630426352X,This is the best video ive ever seen by the best in the world. 311 is awesome and their musical style is great. This video helps you to really get to know the band.,972086400,,164,3.8529411764705883

825324,5,630426352X,"This could easily be titled ""A Week In The Lives Of 311."" Get a look at the antics of the band, crew and fans backstage, on the road and wherever the boys decide to take the camera. Naturally, you will witness  vast arrays of smoking paraphernalia and lime green buds of enormous size.  The video features several live on-stage performances and videos of some  singles from their self-titled album.
The bonus, possibly better than the  video itself, is the included CD. This untitled EP contains, arguably, the  most excellent four 311 songs ever written, tracks not released anywhere  else. 311 fans will not be disappointed.",962236800,,626,4.914285714285715
825325,5,630426352X,"This video will certainly make any 311 fan happy, as the mix of live footage, videos, interviews, and vibe in general are all there, 311 style.  It is not too long (as the Sublime home video is) and is well edited and  produced.  I recommend watching it on a TV that is hooked up to a stereo to  make the most of the live footage.  Also, the Homebrew video is by far  their coolest.  The four song disc which comes with this is also excellent,  especially ""Gap"" which they tend to play live these days.  Worth  every cent!",962064000,,522,4.23469387755102
825326,5,630426352X,"I loved this Video...Any 311 fan would! It's funny and strait up old school. It's Awsome!  The only thing I wanted more of, was the video itself. 54 min...is not enough for J-Luv...",952214400,,181,4.484848484848484

If you think any of the 311 guys are really hot, you'll just LUV  this!  I like Tim Mahoney now...and i watch that video over and over again.  There is so much backstage footage and interviews and stuff.  It's also  really funny.  AND, there's live performances and even interviews w/ the  stage crew.  Oh yeah -- and some of the best stuff is when they show the  music videos for DOWN and HOMEBREW.  So, as a closing statement, i would  like to say that i could watch this video forever, and that you should  DEFINITELY go out and buy this!  Don't even debate this...itz an EASY  CHOICE.",950745600,5,737,4.340740740740741
825329,5,630426352X,"311 is my favorite band in the whole world. If you're a hardcore punk and you want every scrap of 311 stuff you can get, make sure you have ETSD!  (It also comes with a 4 track EP with unreleased material, FYI; Gap, Let  the Cards Fall, Firewater, Tribute) It shows a different side of the boys  (in 311) that probably aren't much seen by average fans. You'll have the  great pleasure of meeting their crew, too. There's tons of live footage,  which is great! Also, they hooked us up with some videos like; All Mixed  Up, Homebrew, Down, etc.. This video will definitely make you laugh until  you can't breathe! It's comedies! Grab it up!  ~Peace out!~",948585600,5,652,4.466101694915254

7866588,5,630426352X,"First off...words can't even begin to explain how awesome this DVD was. I mean i know it is just a ""documentary"" type movie but if you actually start to watch it--it grows into more than that.  You begin to love the band even if you didn't like them before.
The movie contains mainly concert footage and interviews with the band.  But added on are some truly HILARIOUS moments that were recorded on tour from the band using just a home-camera. These guys are not like any other band. This movie shows people how 311 manages to keep it serious with their music--but at the exact same time, screw off and have the times of their lives. It's not just all about music to these guys.  Its about music and having a good time. Even during the interviews they get crazy and say things that are funny--even if they arn't supposed to be funny.
The DVD extras contain 4 music videos for ""Down"", ""Don't Stay Home"", ""Homebrew"", and ""All Mixed Up"".  It also has a trailer for 311's ""Enlarged To Show Detail 2"" home video, and comes with a bonus CD with 4 unreleased tracks.
311's ""Enlarged To Show Detail"" is something you can't pass up. If your a hardcore 311 fan, like myself, you can't live without this. And if you are not a huge fan or even a fan at all, you will still enjoy this movie.
The movie runs for about an hour.  It does have a parental advisory on it and is not for kids. It contains explicit language throughout and has extremely explicit drug content.",1045699200,25,1455,4.394052044609666
