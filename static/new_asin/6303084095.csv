596707,5,6303084095,"The dialog in this set is superb.  Character studies are relevant to the times and blend in beautifully with the historical context.  In many scenes I could actually recall smells, sounds, and the chaos that was and is  India.  If you have lived, visited, or interested in India this is a must  have set.  So get yourself a ""budda peg"" of scotch, a cigar (dare  I say!), and enjoy.",949363200,7,381,4.434782608695652
596708,5,6303084095,"Set in India during the political withdrawal of the British Raj, a powerful spirit of Indian independence registers itself with the few remaining Brits, who have led a lush life in the conquered country. Mother  India makes it known, through various central characters, that the English  must leave.
Not so much depicted as an outright occurrance, the  transition is sketched at great length, via unique individual character  studies, tremendous location footage and a spooky overall awareness that  bad things will happen to those who refute the changing of the guard.
A  memorable series that thrust Tim Pigott-Smith into the mainstream. Very  disturbing.",947116800,14,657,5.382352941176471
596709,5,6303084095,The gorgeous Mr. Malik turns in a sensitive performance as Hari Kumar. He is soooooo cute in this movie. WOW! The dialogue is perhaps overdramatic & the other actors are oftentimes wooden though.,947116800,2,195,4.9393939393939394

596754,5,6303084095,"Among the best in British mini-series. The stillness of many scenes, whether looking at the gorgeous Indian mountains or resting on someone's face, let us pause and reflect - while the horrors of war and brutal occupation occur around us.  The bad guy is despicable, but at times admirable (rushing into a fire to save another's life).  Each character tries to find his/her way to deal with the Raj's racism & classism.  Includes gang rape, prisoner torture, postpartum psychosis, self-immolation, and transvestism, which would make a lesser series into soap opera.",1444867200,,565,5.186813186813187

The PBS version in America screened out the nudity....I mean, for example, naked men (or women) were blurred out! Imagine that. A blurry butt shot, very distracting. Also PBS bleeped out the profanity, also very distracting. So if you are interested in this fantastic historical drama, watch it here!

596809,5,6303084095,"I watched the original the first time it was on PBS - too many years ago!  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series again when PBS rebroadcast it, and was happy to be able to watch the two episodes I missed on Amazon Prime Video.  The photography on location in India was excellent, as were all of the actors.  It was quite a production for its tim, and gave what I imagine was a good insight to what was happening in India during and after the war.  It requires a pretty good time investment to watch the whole series, but I highly recommend it.",1429833600,,547,4.281553398058253
596830,3,6303084095,"This masterpiece, originally on A&E (I believe), still holds up as a gripping story with stellar performances and direction. The DVD itself is scratchy, over colorized, and clearly has not been digitally remastered. Its transfer from VHS format was just that: a straight transfer, which looks like a copy of a copy. At times it is difficult to hear the actors over other sounds going on in the film.

This deserves better treatment as one of television's classics and among some of the most historical pieces done for TV.

If you loved ""Jewel in the Crown"" the first time around as I did, you may overlook these flaws in the DVDs. I also have the latest in equipment, i.e., HD/BluRay DVD player and Smart TV. This may add to what I'm seeing.",1429747200,,741,4.606060606060606

596834,4,6303084095,A interesting and eccentric view of India post Partiton and Ghandi. There are many interesting and maybe Machivellian characters. Insightful also works as a descriptor. Piggot-Smith is insane.,1429488000,,192,5.892857142857143

596870,4,6303084095,Paul Scott's version of the British Raj is compelling and informative as well as awe inspiring.  To think that a tiny little island such as England could rule such a vast empire attests to the English ingenuity and adventure seeking people.  It really put the India England separation in perspective for me.  Very entertaining and evocative.  Liked it very much!,1428796800,,362,4.983333333333333
596871,5,6303084095,"The best series ever made about the effects of imperialism and racism on everyone, not just on the people targeted but on the whites who stood by and watched it happen and profited from it. While I found the Raj quartet sluggish reading, the series did a great job capturing the massive ambivalence and hypocrisy of all concerned. The season ending show with the train scene and Ronald Merrick's end had remained etched in my mind for many, many years (I saw the original airing a few decades ago). When I saw it was available to stream I just had to see it again. The theme throughout the show ""there's nothing I can do"" described best how badly oppression can dehumanize both the oppressor and oppressed. As an African-American, seeing a group of people we now often see as oppressors to us in our communities in the U.S., having been treated so badly themselves (witness also the horrific scenes depicted in the movie ""Ghandi""), you have to wonder what had happened to people of European descent to make it possible to oppress as badly as they have for as long as they have. Hence, possibly, the origin of ""there's nothing I can do."" While being in a position of power over others, you watch them, in this series, act out of powerlessness (or don't act at all...they let Kasim be taken from the train). Again, the best series ever made in my opinion. Also, I became an Art Malik fan for life!",1428796800,,1395,4.5396825396825395

Alas, I am not able to play them.  I have since ordered the re-mastered DVD set and am hoping I will be able to play it.  I only have a VCR-DVD player and a Blu-Ray player and wish there was a way to get a new VCR player but I don't think they are manufactured any more.

596954,5,6303084095,"I saw the entire series when it aired originally in the early 1980s (and read the books then) but hadn't seen it since.
Thirty years later, it holds up remarkably well. Although certain aspects (like the metaphor of the butterfly lace) is/was treated in a heavy-handed manner, that seems more to do with Paul Scott than the filmmakers. But I cannot say enough about the acting. To my mind, every single performance is superb - subtle, rich, deeply grounded - from Art Malik, Susan Wooldridge, and Tim Pigott-Smith to Geraldine James, Derrick Branche, and the gorgeous Charles Dance. Not to forget, Eric Portman, the underappreciated Wendy Morgan, and Saeed Jaffrey. Even actors who appear briefly like Warren Clarke as the wildly camp Corporal Sophie or Jamila Massey as the maharani or Carol Gillies as Clarissa Peplow imbue their performances with spirit and humanity. And, of course, 70 years later, India and Pakistan are still in many ways dealing with their separation and even their colonial heritage. And the thorny political, religious, class, and racial issues examined in ""The Jewel in the Crown"" resonate today in the headlines about so many other parts of the world (even if the players and religions may be different). This mini-series is highly recommended viewing.",1427241600,,1280,5.1

And of course, done well in true PBS, BBC fashion.  Series took some risks and open doors for that time period.  It's well worth watching.

597037,5,6303084095,"This TV rendition of Paul Scott's Raj Quartet is not an ""easy"" series to watch, over-arched as it is by the odious character of Ronald Merrick, played to perfection by Tim Pigott Smith who brings him to truly repellent life. The story is wound around a group of characters living through the end of the British Raj and the eve of Indian independence, a violent time of great upheaval and unspeakable atrocities as Hindus and Muslims turned on each other with savage brutality. Dame Peggy Ashcroft shines as the sad Barbie Batchelor whose hapless life is tied to that of her friend Edwina Crane, an early victim of that inter-religious savagery who leaves a suicide note that might be called the defining theme of the entire series: ""There is no God. Not even on the road from Dibrapur"". Other standout performances include that of Charles Dance as Guy Perron, the sergeant who comes under Merrick's evil sway, Art Malik as Merrick's first victim, Hari Kumar, Eric Porter as Count Bronowski, the somewhat sinister but smooth-talking aide to the Nawab of Mirat, Judy Parfitt as Mildred Layton, hard-drinking mother to both Susan and Sarah, around whom the major part of the story revolves, and whose boiling anger is always just barely suppressed, and Geraldine James as Sarah, the rock of the Layton family who somehow knits all the other characters together in this incredibly rich tapestry of an especially turbulent time. As atmospheric historical epics go, this one is indeed the jewel in the crown.",1425081600,,1502,4.917322834645669

Others have complained about the picture and sound quality, but while at least somewhat valid, these factors are not the issue for me. I remember starting to watch this much-touted series when it first aired some thirty years ago, and quickly growing bored with it, and I was hardly a kid even back then. It had all the elements that I should have loved...an exotic setting, visual and historic accuracy and a superb cast, and yet it somehow left me cold. Now, all these years later, I figured it must have been me, I must have missed something, so I decided to take the plunge and try again. Lo and behold, I still found it dreary and boring. I tried to persevere, and slogged through about half of the series before giving up in utter frustration. For one thing, I did not find any of the characters in the least bit appealing or sympathetic, even those who were not nasty or bigoted where hopelessly nave or shallow. I have read several of the other reviews and find myself wondering if I had watched the same show they had. Oh well, to each his or her own!",1416182400,4,1113,4.381642512077295

I read The Raj Quartet when I was 23, and it is very vividly written. The book itself took me back to the world of my childhood, and enabled me to understand the English experience in India. The series is beautifully conceived. As with the book, (and as in real life) one gets to know the characters in very gradual stages, and in the end one can look back and begin understand the complex phenomenon that people are. The series does an amazing job of evoking the complex reality that one encounters in the books. It is hard to bring these books to life, but the series succeeds in large part.

This is a fascinating story of India during and after WWII; it is the story of a love affair between a young Englishwoman and an Indian man who was raised to be English and didn't know how to live as an Indian. It is the story of a rape, of vengeance and a new  beginning for a new country.

597305,4,6303084095,"I liked the ""Jewel in the Crown"" very much though there were parts that I didn't understand. I enjoy history and know something of the British Raj, but there were too many characters and undercurrents to follow.  Half of one episode was deleted, but after reading a synopsis, I found that Susan had intentionally put her baby in danger. I still don't understand the significance of Merrick's Arab attire in the last episodes  On the positive side, the cast was outstanding. I would like to have seen more about Hari Kumar and to know what happened to his half English baby. The hints of homosexuality in ""Barbie"" seemed melodramatic, but the film is not a recent one. Her death was portrayed almost like the Feast of the Ascension.  I liked the ambiguous ending with Sarah and Hugh and the other British.  The looming struggle of the Indian people was obvious.  I tried to get the entire book, ""the Raj Quartet"", from the local public library but it was not available, so I ordered a copy from Amazon.",1399593600,,1001,4.632768361581921

However, the audio mix on this particular edition is so poor as to make it unwatchable.

597504,5,6303084095,"I watched The Jewel In The Crown when it aired on PBS Masterpiece Theatre some 29 years ago and after nearly 3 decades, in my opinion, it continues to entertain and capture its audience with just as much fascination and emotional ups and downs as it did so long ago. Although the production quality of the video is less than desirable, the story behind the Jewel in the Crown far makes up for any lack of digital enhancement.  Not only is it a thought-provoking look at British colonialism during World War II, but it also provides a historical examination of the struggle for Indian independence from the Commonwealth.  The story begins with the rape of an English girl (Daphne Manners) by unknown assailants after consensual sex with her [taboo] Indian lover Hari Kumar in the Bibighar Gardens.  From this incident, Hari Kumar is taken into custody by a zealous District Inspector Policeman, and true villain, Ronald Merrick, on trumped up charges.  After the second episode, new characters are introduced, however, Mr. Merrick continues throughout this series to be loathsome and evil cad chanting his mantra fear and contempt to the indigenous ever reminding them of his superiority, as a policeman/subsequent British high-ranking officer, and that of the ruling class. Many of the characters are in fact disturbing with condescending and bigoted attitudes which evoke sympathy for the Indians who are mercilessly victimized and ridiculed.  There are however a handful, who question British rule, the prevalence of prejudice, and the merit of imperialism verses self-rule.  I highly recommend this series of 14 episodes; each one being better than the former.  It is indeed difficult not to watch the entire series from beginning to end in one session!

597546,5,6303084095,"Watching yet again one of my favorite film series, The Jewel in the Crown. From my reactionary vantage point, however, I am seeing the Good Guys and the Bad Guys are somewhat different from what I thought from viewings in years past.

WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!

When I first watched Jewel In The Crown, I thought Daphne Manners noble, if a bit unrealistic. Now I see her, in her righteous and blind naivete, preferring her grand illusions to grubby reality, as the cause of a lot of serious misery for other people.

To me, she is another Eve, the true villain of the piece (not Ronald Merrick), a female whose unbridled curiosity, desire and blindness (signified by her physical myopia and thick glasses) lead her to cross a boundary set up for her own good. Disaster ensues because of her moral arrogance.  And then she relies on her English feminine privilege to be indulged and cast as the victim, all the while holding poor stupid Hari to his promise of silence. She is, in my current view, completely contemptible: the face of evil staring out from that homely English girl's mug.

Her Indian ""auntie"" has it right: ""I used to be afraid for you. Now I am afraid for all of us, because of you. You don't shrink from anything, even your mistakes, your mahh-rvelous mistakes. You're like Pandora, who bashed off to the attic and opened her blasted box.""

And Sarah Layton, a much more competent and impressive woman, shares some of her highmindedly foolish ideas, without her reckless and selfish imprudence. Although very conflictedly liberal about the racial issue, she is unrepentantly a snob about class. In tiresomely WhiteGuilt style, she blames not Ghandi/Jinnah, or 1000 years of Islamic invasions and oppression, but the British for the Hindu-Muslim violence and death at independence, when it was they who kept a lid on that country's ancient internal hatreds.

The obvious villain of the piece, working-class Ronald Merrick, the man we are set up to hate, it now seems to me, despite his flaws of character --and they are by no means minor ones-- sees reality and acts on it in ways that people like Daphne and Sarah despise, but on which they have actually always depended for their comfortable lives.

And the Barbie Batchelor character, the unstable hapless nosy meddling and feckless spinster missionary played by Peggie Ashcroft, is an excellent argument for Nietzsche being right about Christianity. God, what an annoying and clingy woman. The complex story would have lost nothing without her irritating presence.

Two newish reflections in response to Paul Scott's ""anti-colonial"" project. The film, at least, acts as if the British were the first and only invaders and colonizers of India. As if the Mughals simply arrived by chance, like the Pilgrims...and all those Muslims just sprouted like mushrooms after a rain. Hindus will tell you different.  The Muslim invasions of India were hugely blood, violent and oppressive; the Brits, by comparison, were Quakers. They made no religious demands and, by the way, built the infrastructure that made modern India. And secondly, if you are going to be a colonial power, do it, but don't fall for your own highminded PR. One thing I have learned from the execrable and ungrateful Reb Saul Alinsky: never embrace a principle that can be used against you.",1369267200,2,3324,4.940860215053763

597552,1,6303084095,"I loved this series 30 years ago and looked forward to sharing it with my wife as we catch up on a variety of India-based dramas.  My memory was of a well-acted period piece with astonishing scenery that I never imagined existed in India, with minor historical insights through interesting and ambiguous personal stories.

The reality on watching this in 2013 is that the quality of film and BBC productions today is so high, that Jewel in the Crown pales by comparison in every measure.  We laughed after each episode, saying ""Is that all that happened (in 50 minutes)?""  I'm not expecting an action movie but at least meaningful insight into people, etc.  Time literally slows to an intolerable pace.

The actors are all quite good, while the script and editing create a jumble of disjointed plot lines and characters who come and go without ever really being developed.  As Great Britain loses her Jewel, no attempt is made to explain Congress, the Muslim / Hindu conflict or much of anything really.

I agree with others on the poor transfer quality and lack of closed captioning.  It is so easy in a digital video editor to clean up the color and sound, and obviously A&E didn't put the least bit of effort into it.

So for those complaining about loose ends, this is probably part of the problem. The product listing on Amazon.com reads 778 minutes, but the actual box reads 750 minutes.

They do this with other releases as well, e.g. Poirot.

Unfortunately the series feels very much like a long-running soap opera with characters coming and going (although in the case of Harry Kumar, jailed for the rape of a British woman, he is never far from the topic of discussion). The style of the program changed throughout the series... in the first few episodes period newsreels were used to introduce topics and characters but this was not the case throughout the rest of the miniseries, with one exception.

The only consistency is the character of Ronald Merrick, who becomes a ricardian villain in the series. Everyone seems to know of him but no one knows what he is up to. Plots he weaves, but it is not clear the purpose until near the end.

Although not the best thing I've ever watched it is still better than most. I had wanted to watch something that captured the revolution in the air.

597697,1,6303084095,"Before I review the story, a few comments about the product.  The transfer is poor, especially when compared to Granada's Sherlock Holmes series, the first set of which was made at about the same time.  The lack of subtitles or closed captioning also leaves a lot to be desired.  Whether you like the story of ""The Jewel in the Crown"" or not, the physical product is quite a bit less than satisfactory.  For a DVD in 2011, a decent transfer and audio/subtitle options are mandatory.

As far as the story goes, I did not like it one bit.  Even though I have not read the books, I am left with the impression that quite a bit of the story in the novels must have been left out to comply with the time requirements for the series.  It comes across as disjointed and difficult to follow.  Possibly inept directing or editing are to blame, but I think it is most likely a poor screenplay.  I am assuming that the quality of the novels is good when I say that; it is unfortunate that there is not more meat in the video series.  The story as presented comes across mostly as discussion of who is having sex with whom, in or out of wedlock and with indiference to the gender of the sex partner.  I strongly suspect that while the novels may have touched on the various aspects of sexuality as it relates to the clash of cultures, it must have done so in a much more sophisticated and less banal manner.  The soundtrack of mostly Indian music is excellent, and the Indian locations are most interesting.  If the story had been even a little better the video series would at least be watchable, but as it is you can skip it as you are not missing anything unless you like soap operas.  This soap opera just happens to be set in India.  A splendid opportunity to really examine the clash of Western and Indian cultures has been lost on account of this poor production.

I was very dissapointed that this set of DVDs did not contain closed captioning!  In this day and age it seems ridiculous not to have included closed captioning!

597753,5,6303084095,"Here we have a 1984 Granada [British] mini-series rendered over a span of fourteen episodes on four DVD discs. The set comes packaged in two cases with an outer slipcover to contain them -- the total running time is 12 hours and 40 minutes. The first entry excepted (which is much longer) each episode runs for 51 minutes.

Other than brief and intermittent archival footage, all the episodes are presented in color, filmed on location in England, Wales, but chiefly in India. The series directors were Christopher Morahan and Jim O'Brien. Ken Taylor adapted the story from Paul Scott's original novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raj-Quartet/dp/0380466988/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raj Quartet</a>. The filmscore (a terrific one) was composed by George Fenton.

This is a dramatic account detailing the lives of Colonial British military officers and the indigenous people of India during the waning years of British rule, (before, during, and following World War II.) The underlying theme of British concern over a prospective Japanese invasion of India blossoms as the tale progresses.

More specifically, this production hones in on the lives of a shady British policeman, (who later transfers to the military as an officer); a naive young English lady to whom the policeman is much attracted; a native Indian who was reared and schooled in elite English society, now returned to his homeland where he feels much disenfranchised; a British intelligence officer (artfully played by Charles Dance:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gosford-Park/dp/B00005JKNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gosford Park</a>), sent in to investigate the nefarious policeman; and many subsidiary characters (including the delightful Peter Jeffrey:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Express/dp/0767817486/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Express</a>), all of whom nicely support the roles of the primary characters.

An English gal of twenty-some, a daughter of nobility who wishes to make herself useful in India, begins work as a nurse in an Indian hospital. She soon comes to the notice of two men, each of whom is interested in her attentions, a policeman and a highly-educated Indian who works as a reporter. It's not long before the two men clash and the Indian finds himself in no position to fend off his officious adversary. The fact that the girl soon falls in love with him only escalates his difficulties with the British authorities and with his policeman rival in particular.

This introductory tableau which launches the chronicle and tragic events, both personal and national, effectively punctuate this saga, continuing to drive it in a serpentine manner to its historic conclusion. But the transition to the independence of India is definitely the wallpaper to the greater melodrama of the lives of the primary characters, both Indian and British. Additional subplots have been nicely worked into the script such as the running conflict between certain Muslim and Hindu factions.

The style of screenwriting and directing is copiously refreshing -- often an event is initially conveyed and the backstory follows, a storytelling technique well known to fans of William Faulkner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snopes-The-Hamlet-The-Town-The-Mansion-Modern-Library/dp/0679600922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snopes: The Hamlet, The Town, The Mansion (Modern Library)</a>) and a few other authors of note. The cinematography is terrific as are the numerous sets and locations.

Still, some will find this mini-series, to be candid, boring. For me, though, the viewing experience was quite the reverse. I don't need fast-paced action scenes, stacked one following another Hollywood-style, in order to digest an enthralling historical yarn. The theme here is generally anti-action, punctuated by a roller-coater approach to injecting events into the tale at unanticipated intervals. Think of this saga chiefly as a pure novel of life rather than as an historical period presentation. My personal experience manifested a nice balance between the romance, the (class, racial, and religious) interactions between the characters, and a fascinating historical setting, all positioned within an exotic eastern realm.

As to the specific quality of the DVD presentation, this isn't high-definition by any means but it's infinitely watchable and I am wholly satisfied on that front.

Highly recommended for enthusiasts of either British drama or the history of India.",1301788800,10,4629,6.065749235474006
597754,2,6303084095,"I know this is a miniseries beloved by many, so I'll try to tread lightly here.

I had heard about ""THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN"" for years, as one of the ""jewels"" of British television.  I enjoy period pieces, ""Masterpiece Classic"" dramas, and have a healthy curiosity about India (where I have traveled).  This is all by way of saying that I'm not a teenager with a short attention span who would dismiss a dated production based on age alone.

That said, I found ""THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN"" to be disappointing at best.

Boring at worst.

I'll not go into detail as to how entire story threads and characters are introduced then abandoned without resolution, or pace, or cinematic sweep (yes, I know location shooting is expensive, but they were clearly there, and largely failed to capture strikingly compelling imagery) as that is not the point of this review.  The point is to disagree strongly with the Amazon.com Editorial Review above which states, ""Twenty years later it has lost none of its power.""

For me, it had very little power.

I write this not simply to be contrarian, but to warn others that sometimes, the Mughal emperor has no clothes.

597755,5,6303084095,"Like many other reviewers here, I found the flawed audio on the discs made it difficult to enjoy the drama in parts.  But the story is so compelling, the acting so superb and the entire production so glorious, I managed to suppress my annoyance during passages where it was hard to understand the dialog.  This was particularly the case in the many scenes where the women are having gossipy little chats, mumbling away to the point of almost incoherence.  Other reviewers here have also complained about the quality of the video, and I agree it isn't quite 3-D, but again, even though the picture quality, after 30 years, isn't as good as one would have hoped, the photography is well done and the scenery is still lovely.

I found the whole production so engrossing, in fact, that I decided to compensate for the poor quality of the audio (and no closed caption option) by sending off to Amazon for the four books that make up the Raj Quartet which I am in the processing of finishing now.  I'm glad I saw the TV production first (again, actually, having watched it on Masterpiece Theatre in the mid-80s).  The film follows the books exactly, though the books add a little more depth and detail, but having seen the dramatized version of the story made it easy to visualize the characters encountered in the written version.

I highly recommend The Jewel in the Crown.  It's a riveting story, well acted and produced and now occupies pride of place in my admittedly paltry little DVD collection.",1298851200,2,1496,4.683206106870229

The picture fits wide-screen TVs perfectly, but it is true it has not been otherwise digitally 'improved'. Potential buyers should consider the technical quality to be virtually the same as the 80s production. In other words, if you have it on videotape, there's no reason to buy it. However, the reverse holds true as well: if you don't have it on videotape, and can get a good price (Amazon fluctuates), you're unlikely to be disappointed.

I basically wanted a taste of India and it certainly satisfied me in that regard. Granted, the period in question (ca. 1943) is long gone, but this is an affectionate look at Indian culture. Rather bittersweet, as it views through British eyes the end of the British occupation. And the Brits run the gamut, from racist authoritarians to the genuinely interested who realize that India and Indians have a great deal to offer. While the 14 episodes are spun from a Western point of view, to me the philosophical tone is quite Indian.

597760,5,6303084095,"Among the classic installments which aired on PBS Masterpiece Theater over the past 25 years, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is one of the best.  Although this series first aired in 1984, this multi-layered story about life in India during the 40's continues to pack a powerful and complex dramatization about inter-racial relationships, social and cultural prejudice, classicism, bigotry, hypocrisy, and the effect of imperialism of the British Raj on India, its princely states, and its people.

This ambitious epic tackles intricate details about the lives and customs of the ruling high caste Hindu class, and the British who ultimately control and rule their country.  Yet, accurately interwoven is the story about the political mood of India; clashes between Hindu and Muslim, strife between the militant rebels and the followers of Gandhi at the height of India's struggle for self-rule and independence.

Equally compelling, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is also a story about the idiosyncrasies and fallibility of human nature; expertly portrayed by a cast of exception actors: lust for power, hedonism/sadism, vanity, narcissism, deception, cruelty and envy, but also honor and loyalty.  The host of characters are unforgettable, and you will long remember the interrelationships of the many individuals who emerge as heroes/heroines, conspirators, villains, martyrs, and the 'righteous'.

This DVD mini-series includes four disks, and the quality was very good.

If you are a fan of classic PBS mini-series, I urge you to include this DVD box set in your collection.

A lot of middle class Brits went out there just to take advantage of the cheap labor which enabled them to live as they never could at home.  The underlying rage of the people of India having their culture taken over was obvious and it seemed that the Brits were completely oblivious to what was going on with the natives in spite of all the bowing and scraping.  They (the Brits) chose to close their eyes and pretend that all was well.  The characters were strong and the acting was great.

There are so many forces, personal, cultural, sexual, racial, and historic, at work in this complex narrative, I could watch it over and over. It doesn't hurt that it's enacted by a brilliant cast, including legends like Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Rachel Kempson. Judy Parfitt is absolutely chilling.

But the video transfer in this set is a crime, really. I remember being struck by the gorgeous location photography when the series first aired. The video quality of this set is jarringly ugly. Surely this is worth a restoration or digital remastering. Shame on A&E for not caring enough to do this properly.

So before buying either, I borrowed both versions from the library and watched them side-by-side. The answer is that--as others have said--the two versions are identical in every detail, except the artwork on the box and the design of the DVD labels. Nothing else was changed at all.

It's not perfect, but I enjoyed The Jewel in the Crown when it was first broadcast, and I enjoyed it again this time.

Maybe if you knew some of the history of India's emerging independence, the story would make sense to you, but to us, it was all muddled and obscure. And the characters and their stories were equally disappointing. About the only person you get to know is Merrick, and he's so reprehensible that you wish he would just go away.

We kept watching episode after episode, hoping that the endless mess of loose ends would get tied up in the end, but it never happened. Too often, at the end of a scene or an episode, we'd look at each other and say, ""Huh?"" That's probably not the reaction a filmmaker is looking for from his audience. Characters we cared about just disappeared from the story, with little or no explanation. Others who were thrown in for no apparent reason stayed on screen way too long.

597883,5,6303084095,"The Jewel in the Crown depicts the last few years of the Raj, Britain's Indian Empire, through the lives of a few characters and families.  Central to the story is the fate of Hari Kumar, a British-educated Indian who has the temerity to fall in love with Daphne Manners, a British girl who is new to India and doesn't understand or accept the racial mores of the Raj.  Although Daphne and Hari virtually disappear after the first couple of episodes, their story has a huge impact on the other main characters: Ronald Merrick, the policeman who thought he loved Daphne, the Leyton family, with whom Merrick took up, Ahmed Kasim the secular Muslim, and countless others.

The story can be a bit confusing if you aren't too familiar with the story of India's move towards independence, but the main love story and its attendant sub-connections are pretty clear, and the ending is quite satisfying.  Above all, the scenery and the background music are entrancing.",1202860800,7,960,4.835365853658536
597884,5,6303084095,"Admittedly, I'm not a history buff and probably, like most Americans, what I do know about WWII is solely from the American perspective. The Jewel in the Crown was highly recommended, but I honestly wasn't enthused about getting a history lesson of the British occupation in India. I'm happy to report, however, that this series had me hooked. Not only was it brilliantly written and acted, but I came away with such respect for Paul Scott, the author of The Raj Quartet on which this series was based. A virtual lifetime of work went into this project, all gained from his experiences in India. There is so much detail, so many interesting, fully developed characters and intriguing, interwining plots, it's absolutely unbelievable how all of it blended so well. After watching 12 hours of these DVD's I had to read all four novels of The Raj Quartet. The DVDs were wonderfully satisfying, but getting more character background from the books was a treat. Like most A&E & BBC productions, there's always a wealth of remarkably trained British actors in this series. We get to see a very young Charles Dance-who was recently in ""Bleak House"" as the unmerciful Mr. Tulkinghorn. I do have to say though that I was most impressed with Tim Pigot-Smith as Ronald Merrick and Eric Porter as Count Bronowsky. Smith gives a very layered performance of Merrick who is so intensly disturbing. The payoff is finally understanding what makes him tick. This doesn't happen till the end, but all the pieces fall into place. Count Bronowsky is a very interesting character. He seems to be a delightful man and oddly seems to know everything about anybody. I've watched the series in full a few times and each time I hear or see something new from Bronowsky. Fortunately he's played by an actor who doesn't squander the time he's given. After reading the novels and viewing the DVD's I'm glad I finally have a general understanding of the British and Indian experiences during WWII. It's interesting to watch these cultures interact, their general distrust of one another, and how vastly different they can view a single, shared incident. It's heartbreaking, too, to see the damage that was done to India, not only from the War, but the toll British (and some Indian) extravagance had on the land, it's animals, the subjugation of the Indians and it's lasting effects on their government and justice system.

P.S. Try and avoid reading Amazon's product description for this DVD series. It reveals way too much of the plot. Also, there's several complaints about the sound & picture quality. True, it's not the quality that that I'm used to, but it didn't interfere with my enjoyment. When I'm watching a story this good, the picture quality is the least of my cares.",1185494400,39,2750,4.851063829787234
597885,5,6303084095,"I have read ""The Raj Quartet"" (i.e. ""Jewel in the Crown) twice -- all 2,000 pages of it -- and I love the story.  The novel and this DVD paint a fascinating and exhaustive look of the English in the last days of their rule of India.

The story is circular.  It centers around the rape of an English girl in the Biribigar gardens in 1942. Seen through the lens of that event we go on to a picture of the British in India during World War II, the growing movement toward independence, and finally the consequences of Muslim-Hindu animosity aroused by independence.  Most of the cast is superb and the number of characters is enormous: a tortured, lower-class policeman of chilling efficiency, a sensible English girl with a malevolent mother and a madly incompetent sister, several admirable but ineffective missionaries, befuddled soldiers, a Cambridge scholar, a demented but appealing Russian political advisor, Muslim and Indian politicians, and Hari Kumar -- the Indian boy who was English at heart and served as the scapegoat for all the English failings in India.

It's long, slow-moving, majestic, educational, sometimes a bit unlikely, inconclusive, but compelling -- a soap opera in the exotic and explosive setting of the British Raj. There are elements of Kipling here, and ""Passage to India"" and Mother Teresa -- a whole melange of not-so-original ideas and scenes.  But nobody has ever taken such a meticulously close look at British India in its death throes as has author Paul Scott in the novel and this DVD.

""The Raj Quartet"" in my opinion is one of the very greatest novels of the 20th century and ""Jewel in the Crown"" one of the very greatest of television dramas.  That being said neither the color nor the sound of this DVD is of even average quality. The story deserves better.

Nonetheless, I couldn't stop watching because I had to know what was going to happen next. The story is very complex, and the ending not as satisfying as I would have liked, but now that it's over I can't stop thinking about it.

597888,5,6303084095,"Despite the accolades it has drawn, I never liked the PBS dramatization of JEWEL IN THE CROWN-- not as drama, that is.  For one thing, it is too laden with Reichian psychology-- and we know what that means, though I can't say it here.  For another, it's frustrating.  One waits endlessly for the tragically wronged Hari Kumar to be united with the child of his beloved Daphne Manners, who might be his, although then again, she might not be as Daphne was gang-raped immediately after he made love to her.  One waits endlessly for him to at last win the respect of the Englishmen he went to school with but who now shun him as (to use the usual English exaggeration) a ""black"".  One is led to believe that these things might have happened-- but only after the drama's unsatisfying end.  Finally, the series is unbelievable.  For instance, why does Daphne, who is genuinely in love with Hari and opposed to British prejudices, refuse to stand up for him when he is unjustly accused of her rape?  Why does she not admit that they made love but that it was voluntary, and that Hari was as distressed by the subsequent attack as she was?  She will not even look at the men who are accused of the rape, all Hari's friends-- all we have is this statement from her, piling disbelief on disbelief-- ""I know they can't be the ones, because they are all Hindu and one of the men who raped me was Muslim-- don't ask me why.""  As if someone undergoing such a trauma would notice anything so trivial-- Reichian psychology again.  And perhaps something else, for to the extent that the series really reproduces Paul Scott's THE RAJ TRILOGY, which I do not know, having never read it, it is remarkably like E.M. Forster's A PASSAGE TO INDIA, in concluding in some English version of Hinduism-- whether accurate or inaccurate-- that life is meaningless, as Mrs. Moore does after she sees the Marabar caves.

It is only as a documentary of the end of the British Raj and the tensions within Indian society-- tensions which persist to this day-- that the series is not only laudable but a ""must-see"".  Of course we know all about the British government's oppression of the Indians, as symbolized by the evil Ronald Merrick's targeting of the lamb-like innocent, Hari Kumar.  What comes as a surprise is the fate of the other native principle in the series, Ahmed Kasim.  I grew up in the era of ""The Concert for Bangladesh"", when even liberals like myself would have agreed that the ""bad guys"" in the religious conflicts of the subcontinent were invariably the Muslims.  After all, how could someone who could not even bring himself to kill a cow kill a human being?  So I was unaware of what was happening when Ahmed entered that train cabin with a Muslim maid and several English people, including his best English friend, Sarah.  The symbol which a native hurriedly scrawled on the cabin door as the train was leaving was unintelligible to me.  Even when the train was forcibly halted by a cow tied to the tracks, and Ahmed looked out in the ominous silence and told his cabinmates to close the windows and hide the maid under the seat, and windows began to break and people to scream, I was confused.  I didn't hear him say ""Seems it's me they want"" before he stepped out, telling the others to lock the door behind him, and thought perhaps he might be joining in the slaughter-- so deep was my prejudice!  It was only when the middle-aged Englishman looked out a peephole and said, trying to stifle his urge to vomit, ""They're slaughtering all the Muslims-- just hacking them to pieces,"" did I realize what was really going on-- an attack by HINDU fanatics-- and that Ahmed had given his life to save the others in the cabin.  Then I knew that the symbol scrawled on the cabin door had been a crescent.  After seeing this segment once again, on a video bought from Amazon, it seems like the stigmata of Christ.

That is why it is difficult to understand Sarah's reaction to Ahmed's voluntary sacrifice.  Her shame and self-hatred that they, the privileged English ruling class, had all just ""let him go"", is natural, but her anger at Ahmed for not seeking to save his own life-- which would of course have jeopardized the lives of all the others-- is not.  It is as if she is saying that his death was senseless-- as if she has reached the conclusion that life itself has no meaning, no right and wrong-- like Mrs. Moore after she saw the Marabar Caves.  From a broad sociological point of view, Ahmed's death, and the death of all the Muslims on the train-- was indeed senseless.  But from a standpoint of personal morality, it makes perfect sense.  It teaches us that even in the grip of injustice and cruelty, one must do what is right.  Where Hari is merely a victim, Ahmed is a hero, and his death a glorious martyrdom.  That a Muslim could be portrayed this way (and accurately, for people who could not kill a cow DID kill human beings) holds a lesson for our time, and my generation whose mindless prejudice has only been worsened by the events of 9/11: THAT WE WERE WRONG, that Muslims can be not only victims but moral heroes as well.  And whatever nightmares we have, like Mrs. Moore, built out of our brush with the vast and meaningless OM, that life DOES have meaning. If it takes a Muslim to teach us that, we had better start paying more respect to a religion which does after all, share with Christianity and Judaism a sense of right and wrong.",1163548800,19,5446,4.53680981595092

597951,5,6303084095,"This powerful and moving eight part miniseries has lost none of its impact since it was first aired nearly twenty years ago. Highly acclaimed, it won numerous awards. Beautifully filmed on location in India, England, and Wales, it is a highly atmospheric and complex drama, redolent of the flavor of the turbulent years just before India gained its independence from British rule.

The story begins in 1942, and through its memorable characters, both British and Indian, it masterfully weaves a tapestry of events that explains the state of flux that India was in at the time and the collision between East and West that often occurred, as the old guard made way for the new. Pivotal events become symbolic of India's struggle for independence, and it is those events that impact on those living in India and struggling to survive through those turbulent years. This tumultuous and sumptuous saga ends with India's independence in 1947.

Masterfully acted, lushly filmed, and awash with period detail, it is so atmospheric as to make its viewers feel that they themselves are there during the decline and fall of the British Raj. It captures the essence of India and its ramparts of colonialism. Interspersed throughout the episodes are snippets of old newsreels that recount India's involvement in World War II and the threat of Japanese invasion through adjacent Burma. These serve to further move the story along and imbue it with an air of authenticity that stays with the viewer.

This multi-faceted series, based upon Paul Scott's literary gem, ""The Raj Quartet"", is a fine adaptation that should not be missed. The award calibre performances by the entire cast are stellar and will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. Those interested in period pieces, historical dramas, and epics on Indian colonialism will love this series, as will anyone interested in a superlative drama.

A powerful and intricate story in which the personal and the political interact (though the pace, tension and clarity slacken a little in the 12th and 13th of the 14 episodes); terrific acting (not least because it is mostly understated in a very British way, which anyway corresponds to the ethos of the British at that time and to some extent still; we often know what the characters are feeling not through what they say, but through what is reflected on their faces), stunning photography (but see the next paragraph), an impeccable sense of the period and of class attitudes at the time.

This is well brought out in this adaptation.  I don't think it will ever be bettered.

The distillation of the authors plot is well-thought out by the screenplay and the acting by ALL concerned is superlative.  Especially to be noted are Peggy Ashcroft, Art Malik, and Tim Piggott-Smith.  All of the rest of the characters - be they major or minor - are ideally cast and there is not a false not anywhere.

598004,2,6303084095,"(Review written 12 Oct 2008.)  Multiple jeers to A&E for its sorry, shoddy practices.  Many weeks before the release of the 25th Anniversary Edition, I contacted A&E three times to find out if this were a digitally remastered version of ""Jewel in the Crown."" I got no response to my two e-mails to A&E, and their customer service rep on the phone didn't even know they had a new edition being released.  A&E's previous DVD release in 2001 received many negative reviews because of the poor technical quality of the transfer (e.g., poor sound, light, filmy picture).  I hoped that A&E would have used this opportunity to provide a high quality technical transfer that such a brilliant series deserves.  In the absence of any information from A&E, I ordered the new edition from amazon, but immediately returned it after seeing it had not been remastered.  A few days after I mailed the 25th Anniversary Edition back to amazon, I finally got a letter from A&E confirming the new edition was just a repackaged version with no technical upgrades.  It is greatly disappointing that A&E seems so unfamiliar with its products, that its customer service is so unresponsive, and -- most importantly -- that A&E does not have enough respect for such a classic series to see it gets the technical makeover it deserves.  It would also have been appropriate to have included extras to this anniversary edition, but none were.

598005,5,6303084095,"I find it ironic that the beginning of each episode of ""The Jewel in the Crown"" begins with footage from the 1911 Durbar near Delhi.  The 1911 Durbar symbolizes Britain at its imperial apogee, just begin things began to come apart at the seams.  More importantly, the durbars portrayed the British Empire as the British wanted to see it: a benevolent empire, mighty & indestructable, bringing order and civilization with it wherever it went.
The reality, of course was much different.  As the British withdrew from the various imperial possessions, they left behind a mixed legacy, and nowhere was this more evident than in India, where the religious antagonism between Hindu & Muslim continues to be felt today, almost 56 years after independence.
""The Jewel in the Crown"" follows the final years of the Raj, 1942 to 1947.  The story unfolds at wonderfully relaxed pace, as principal characters enter & depart, to be replaced with other characters.  Some of the important characters, such as Guy Perron, are ones the viewer will not even meet until the 10th episode.
The two characters that are the driving force behind the story are Hari Kumar, an Indian given an upper-class public school education in England, and Ronald Merrick, a lower class police officer.  Both are men who simply do not fit in, and are abundantly aware of it.
Kumar is an Indian with English sensibilites; he knows nothing of Indian culture and initially can only speak english, but is regard by the British as simply another damned Indian.  He struggles to find his place in an environment where the British expect that all Indians should know their place.
Merrick, on the other hand, is a ""grammar-school boy"" (as he constantly reminds people) who has great talent, ability, and ambition.  He moves up through the ranks due to his talents, but knows that he is regarded as not the ""right sort of people"" by the upper-class officers with whom he serves.  It is difficult to know if Merrick has more contempt for the Indians or for the upper class British.
As the story moves along, it becomes apparent that the Raj has brought neither the order nor the high morals that the British would have the world believe they represent.  The private lives of the ruling British prove to be just as messy and compromised as the political legacy of the Raj.
This is a beautifully acted, spectacularly staged production.  It helps to have some knowledge of Indian history, but even if you don't know much about the Raj, the stories of the various characters are enough to keep you hooked for the whole 750 minutes.",1055548800,15,2578,4.8099547511312215

My daughter and I have an entire vocabulary based on various lines and situations in the production.  It ranks with Brideshead Revisited as one of the two best productions PBS has ever aired.  It is a background particularly relevant to the present situation in India and Pakistan (and elsewhere) - a division of people by religious persuasion - which was fostered by the British and their philosophy of divide and conquer.  The same situation prevailed in other colonies; Cyprus in particular comes to mind, and its now divided country with Muslims in the north, Christians in the south.  Not only does the theme of ""racial"" interaction and non-interaction prevail, but the expression of utter frustration ""that after 300 years in India, there was nothing I could do.""  The liberal British who desired to find a way out of the dilemma of Raj versus a liberated India in a manner honorable for all involved found they could do nothing - they were as trapped in the web of history and injustice as the India they desired to assist to independence.  And not only politically - but morally, equitably, reasonably.  In today's morass of international chess, perhaps it is a lesson we should attend to and learn from.  The violence done to Daphne Manners is to point up in reverse the violence done to Indians of all walks of life, and the pointlessness of attempting to repair any of it.  The ruling British upper crust in the film is as indifferent to a ""lesser"" soul of their own country in the figure of the missionary Barbie (Peggy Ashcroft) as to the ""lowly"" Indian - whether that Indian be maharajah or untouchable.  And yet, at the same time, naivete is just as dangerous and as malicious, a theme also hearkened to in the film The English Patient, another milestone in film making history, and which records British insensitivity in Egypt at approximately the same time.  The film is important.  The book is more so as it goes into great depth regarding the subtleties and Byzantine labyrinths by which such attitudes are arrived at and rationalized.  British ""responsibility"" in the end becomes British ineptness.  Americans have now assumed, for better or worse, the mantle of world ""nanny"" - this film is a bell wether that rings of pitfalls of ""empire"" that have already befallen us and that await in the wings.",1036972800,14,2458,4.748235294117647
598009,2,6303084095,"This DVD set is a real heartbreaker!
The Jewel in the Crown is absolutely one of historic the highlights of ""quality"" television. An absolutely arresting story. Wonderful script, wonderful acting, etc.  I can't add anything on that count to the reviews already here.
That makes the TERRIBLE quality of the DVD transfer all the more disappointing.  This set has literally the WORST video quality I have ever seen on a DVD!  Murky, muddy picture with visible scratches and dirt on the film.  The soundtrack is a little better.  On my home theater setup it sounds like its coming over a half-decent clock radio.  Seriously, the picture looks like they took an old VHS tape of the show and just ran it through a disc burner.
No, I don't expect blockbuster quality from an 30-year old BBC film, but I would have expected something more like the recent DVD set of Elizabeth R, which is quite watchable.
Sadly, this is almost surely the only DVD we'll ever see of this marvelous series.  I'm going to rent the old tapes of this.  They might easily be better.  If not, I guess this is what we're all stuck with.",1026950400,316,1103,4.586734693877551
598050,5,6303084095,"They just don't make mini series of this quality anymore. The slow pace grows on you, lets you savor the sounds and images of India without ever distracting from the storyline. The screenplay follows closely the original books of the Raj quartet and the actors are so well chosen and perform so admirably I couldn't picture anybody else in their parts.
The shadings of character are well outlined and the spirit of colonialism is well preserved and ogled from every possible angle. There are no cheap shots just character studies of fantastic depth and patience. The starcrossed love story of Hari Kumar and Daphne Manners is the heart of the story and infiltrates the fate of the people coming after them as well as the fate of India as a whole long after they have exited the stage. Like all masterpieces this one resonates long after one has completed watching it and deserves a second or third try just to absorb all the subtleties and take in the atmosphere. More than any other series I know of it really transplants you to the locations, makes you feel part of the conversations and is real and sublime at the same time. The acting is naturalistic and intensely appealing in the case of Susan Wooldridge, Art Malik and Charles Dance, bareboned and heartbreaking in the case of Peggy Ashcroft and downright furious in its malice and restraint in the figure of Tim Pigott Smith. I know I will hold on to it forever and watch it many more times.",1025395200,9,1449,4.642023346303502
598051,5,6303084095,"I love to curl up with this set and travel to Pangkot and Rawalpindi where I can cry for Hari Kumar and shiver whenever Ronald Merrick looks toward the camera. If Colonel Merrick and Hari/Harry and the Gardens of the Bibighar intrigue you, please read the Raj Quartet- all 5 volumes-or get them on tape to take to the beach.  That plummy-voiced guy who reads for B.O.T crams so much portent and foreboding into the first book ""The Jewel in the Crown"" that you will race to the library for ""The Day of the Scorpion"", ""The Towers of Silence"", ""A Division of the Spoils"" and the elegant, perfectly tragic ""Staying On"" (not officially part of the Quartet but the indispensable coda.) Paul Scott's interweaving of different people's experiences over time creates a chilling pattern that brings history alive. Hari and Ronald and Lady Manners are threads that run through all five volumes, Miss Crane and Daphne haunt the volumes like ghosts, Sarah Layton and Barbie Batchelor become the vortex around which the whole panorama whirls. No sooner do you feel you've got good and evil sorted out, then all the cards get re-shuffled and Scott deals a new hand. The sheer scale of India dwarfs individuality and in the (final,final)end you are left with the heartbreaking question-how could such good intentions go so terribly wrong, but what on earth were the British thinking?. The ideal for me? Listen to all five books then, when all the characters are vividly and complexedly alive in my brain, watch the film and step into the screen.",1014940800,9,1529,4.813688212927756
598052,5,6303084095,"This powerful and moving eight part miniseries has lost none of its impact since it was first aired nearly twenty years ago. Highly acclaimed, it won numerous awards. Beautifully filmed on location in India, England, and Wales, it is a highly atmospheric and complex drama, redolent of the flavor of the turbulent years just before India gained its independence from British rule.
The story begins in 1942, and through its memorable characters, both British and Indian, it masterfully weaves a tapestry of events that explains the state of flux that India was in at the time and the collision between East and West that often occurred, as the old guard made way for the new. Pivotal events become symbolic of India's struggle for independence, and it is those events that impact on those living in India and struggling to survive through those turbulent years. This tumultuous and sumptuous saga ends with India's independence in 1947.
Masterfully acted, lushly filmed, and awash with period detail, it is so atmospheric as to make its viewers feel that they themselves are there during the decline and fall of the British Raj. It captures the essence of India and its ramparts of colonialism. Interspersed throughout the episodes are snippets of old newsreels that recount India's involvement in World War II and the threat of Japanese invasion through adjacent Burma. These serve to further move the story along and imbue it with an air of authenticity that stays with the viewer.
This multi-faceted series, based upon Paul Scott's literary gem, ""The Raj Quartet"", is a fine adaptation that should not be missed. The award calibre performances by the entire cast are stellar and will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. Those interested in period pieces, historical dramas, and epics on Indian colonialism will love this series, as will anyone interested in a superlative drama. Bravo!
The quality of this four disc DVD box set is pretty good. The visuals are better than expected for what appears to be a direct transfer from the original print. The colors for the most part are still vivid and the audio is crystal clear. All in all, this transfer to DVD has fared pretty well. It is a DVD set well worth having in one's collection. As it runs about twelve and a half hours in length, it will provide the viewer with many hours of enjoyment.",1009843200,124,2348,4.887218045112782
598053,5,6303084095,"For me, watching an entire series by myself, The Jewel in the Crown,  based on The Raj Quartet by Paul Scott, was  a guilty pleasure.  Pleasure because it was excellent in the tradition of the best of British, and guilty because it filled the greater part of eight videocassettes, for a total of 750 minutes.  I felt slightly less decadent than I might have  because I watched it on library copies.
The story invokes the tumultuous last days of the British raj in India.  Although it is perceived from a British point of view, it is sympathetic for the most part to the aspirations of the various sects making up the hodgepodge of peoples populating the Indian nation, and the plot emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.
The  white British citizens during the dying days of the British empire hold a love-hate relationship with India.  The English pine for England while being alternately enchanted by the culture or repelled by the teeming squalor of this turbulent emerging nation.
The fact that India on its own was a closed society may explain her historical acquiescence to British rule.  There was a rigid caste system in India, and since the highest ranking maharajahs looked up to the paler-skinned colonists, therefore the rest of India must too. Some of the characters on both sides could be considered a bit archetypal were it not for their fleshing out and convincing portrayal by an exceptional cast of actors.  We can only feel sympathy for a handsome, intelligent man like Hari Kumar who is at home neither among the English he was brought up with nor his fellow Indians. At the beginning, he does not even speak Hindi.  His is the heart of a dilemma common to ""colonial"" countries.
And the struggle which pits groups against each other, such as Hindu against Moslem, is a distillation of the diversity of the peoples in India.  Today, the only common language of India is English, and it is therefore its official one, an ironic postscript to the rule of the Raj.
Throughout the series, compelling footage of old British newsreels is shown.  It threads the episodes together while highlighting the pomposity (pretensions that are surprisingly poignant)  on both sides of the former regime.",1007769600,16,2221,4.856763925729443
598054,5,6303084095,"A riposte to Mr Darragh O'Donoghue (see above), that is. Thank goodness that the TV producers thought it proper to respect the book they were using. It rarely happens. Mr O'Donoghue seems to be looking for some pacey, racey bit of instant gratification. And political correctness, of course. His complaint that ""non-white characters are marginalised"" is every bit as daft as moaning that Jane Austen doesn't spend time telling us about the horny-handed sons of toil. Paul Scott (and the TV people) gave us characters we could very nearly (but not quite) loathe, as genuine representatives of 'Empah'. The mushy David Lean film he prefers gives us spadefuls of righteous indignation but no gut target for that indignation. (Oh, & gorgeous camerawork too, if you're a 'chocolate-box' fan.) Mr O'Donoghue: get the slippers on, the cocoa in the mug, and settle down to a few cosey reruns of 'Glenroe'. Will Biddy or Miley make the tay?

598056,5,6303084095,"THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is probably the most powerful and moving film story I have ever seen. THE ENGLISH PATIENT comes close to being my all time favorite, but JITC wins. I am interested in comtemplative psychological studies and Sarah Layton and several of the other characters are very complex people whom the film portrays rather well.
JITC pays attention to detail. It is sumptuous like an early Merchant-Ivory film--ROOM WITH A VIEW. The most minute details are important--the silver ""Apostle"" spoons, the dressing table loaded with costmetics jars, cherry jelly for the blanc mange, hats and dresses and uniforms based on WWII clothing styles, interiors of Rose cottage, bungalows, palaces, railroad cars, and the slum dwellers of large Indian cities.
In spite of what appears to be a direct transfer of the original 20-year old print to DVD, the colors and resolution are pretty good. It's rather like listening to an ADD recording. The original filmography was marvelous (a good part of the film must have been shot in India or southeast Asia) though some of the outdoor scenes waver in places owing to the deterioration caused by the affect of light exposure--but never matter, it's still head and shoulders above more recent works. The folks who produced this film loved India and have probably made it as real as it can be for the armchair/time traveler. All we are missing are the smells and the taste of Tandoorii cooking.
I have become so accustomed to stream-lined conversations on screen I had forgotten what I was missing. Imagine a scene in a sitting room involving 4-5 women discussing a baby's feeding schedule. The scene is important for what the characters don't say. That's one effect of this film, you realize what people don't say. It's got to do with manners, and being a brick.
I think this film will appeal to many people (has appealed to many) but today it would probably be classified as a ""woman's film."" JITC had lots of juicy roles for female actresses. For me Sarah Layton is the key figure and through her the film is held together. The actress who played her is virtually unknown, and not especially pretty, but she is beautiful. I came to care very much for Sarah, although she is mindful of her class which can irritate good democrats.
Peggy Ascroft is fabulous as Barbie Bachelor, the aging and unwanted missionary. Other actresses you might recognize include Rosmary Leach as Aunt Fenny (the mother in ROOM WITH A VIEW and in PD James COVER HER FACE. Older Mrs Layton, Colonel Layton's  stepmother had her hair filled with flowers in ROOM WITH A VIEW, and many of the male and female actresses show up today in PBS Mysteries and other current BBC productions. Dalziel and Pascoe fans will recogize Rosie the gay corporal. Art Malik who plays Hari Kumar and the actor who plays Jimmy Walker, the fellow who seduces Sarah, have both made recent appearances in SECOND SIGHT on PBS Mystery. If you're an American fan of BBC productions you will recognize many faces although Charles Dance who plays Guy Perron and Tim Piggot-Smith who plays Ronald Merrick may be the only names you recognize other than Dame Peggy Ashcroft.  The fellows who play Indians have shown up as Pakistanis in MY SON THE FANATIC and EAST IS EAST and Rumpole.
The story is told from the perspective of the upper class English serving in India.  Along with Hari Kumar who was raised in England, most are connected via their association with a particular school 'Chillingborough"" (sp??). You hear the school name mentioned so often, you almost laugh when Merrick (Tim Piggot-Smith) says ""Chillingborogh of course"" when the issue of school affiliation is raised (he is from the middle-class and did not go to the upper-crust school).
There are some scenes involving only Indians, but I think these are so rare and incomplete with few exceptions that you must see them as necessary to futher the plot. I've watched this film twice now, and I know it is very complex. I'm sure it's an allegory along the lines of the Mahahabrata (sp??) and someday I'll figure it out. It's got to do with mothers and fathers and children and an invisible man.",987206400,34,4147,4.80532212885154
