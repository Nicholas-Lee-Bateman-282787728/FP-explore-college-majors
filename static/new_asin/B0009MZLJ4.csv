8063368,2,B0009MZLJ4,"definitely a fan of all the dead end kids, east side, bowery boys movies. my low rating is for the lousy quality print, despite what other reviewers might say. it was a long time coming for the bowery boys dvd sets in great quality. i just hope it won't take much longer for the east side kids to be restored and released.",1378339200,,322,4.209677419354839

collections from ""Critics' Choice""! They's great! You can probably get 'em
cheaper --- anywhere --- but NEVER as pristine as THESE suckers! WQow! Like
being ON The Bowery! I can smell them fruits and vegetables, now!
