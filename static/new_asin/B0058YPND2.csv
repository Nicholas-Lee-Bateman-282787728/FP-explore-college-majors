4606938,5,B0058YPND2,"When I first heard a movie like this was being released under Disney Channel I, along with many others, thought ""Oh now Disney Channel is going to help skewer the fascinting world of vampires...as if Summit Entertainment didn't do it enough.""

I was pleasantly suprised, I have to say. This movie can appeal to almost anyone that watches it, that is if they are older than probably ten. Believe it or not, some of these action scenes have a lot of violence and blood and it could be a little scary to young kids.

Also, ""My Babysitter's A Vampire"" has a perfect balance of both cheesy and clever humor, plus the necessary action sequences of any good vampire movie. There is both physical humor as well as the typical clever jokes. And then they are followed by a violent action sequence.

That makes this movie perfect for both younger teens to laugh at the hysterical humor, and for older teens to both laugh and marvel at the shockingly violent vampire fight scenes. ONE OF MY FAVORITE VAMPIRE MOVIES OF ALL TIME!",1322870400,14,1016,4.602209944751381

8462500,5,B0058YPND2,"My 7 year old daughter loves this movie. I had it on my DVR and she was watching it once a week, so I decided to get it on the Kindle so she wasn't using the main television all the time. My other children ages 12, and 9 like it too, but the 7 year old really enjoys it. So this was the best pick for her. I thought it might be too scary for the kids at first, but it really isn't. It has some humor in it as well which is good.",1386806400,2,428,3.5638297872340425
