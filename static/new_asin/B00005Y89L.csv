1675423,5,B00005Y89L,"This is the nearest I have come to finding anything that resembles a Ballet class.  The exception is that the barre exercises are done on the floor, but following that is center work.  Terrific video.  Note do not expect to all ways get a cardio workout from Ballet unless you are in Swan Lake or a serious professional dancer.",1120780800,5,327,4.508474576271187
1675424,3,B00005Y89L,"This is a very well-produced, professional exercise video based on ballet moves, but it just didn't do much for me. I think that after all the aerobics and step aerobics I've done, I just couldn't retrain myself to learn dance steps, despite the excellent instruction.  I felt that the toning moves were challenging and effective, but couldn't get a good cardio workout from the ballet.",1031184000,23,386,4.938461538461539

7956763,3,B00005Y89L,"I did ballet for eleven years as a teenager and was looking for an exercise routine at home that would be like a ballet class. This is kind of that, but not really. It's a series of ballet-like stretches and exercises, but they don't seem to build up and then cool down like a regular ballet class, or any regular exercise class for that matter (Pilates, aerobics, etc.). They seem to be presented at random. The first exercise is a series of moves across the floor in center work that would challenge any beginner. And the video shots keep switching between color of the whole group who's dancing and black and white close ups of the faces - not even the feet, just torsos and faces! Black and white in the 21st century is strange indeed. Overall, a mediocre video.",1467849600,,766,4.478571428571429

7956765,4,B00005Y89L,Liked it.  You have to change to another dvd routine it does get boring.  THighs feel muscular if nothing else.,1406592000,,111,4.5
7956766,5,B00005Y89L,"An excellent full body work out, the 60 minutes passed by very quickly, every section is broken down and easy to follow. I loved it so much i am now awaiting on ballet boot camp 2 being delivered. I had a tight hamstring and felt improvement after just one workout which i wasn't expecting. Would highly recommend.",1336089600,,314,4.526315789473684
7956767,4,B00005Y89L,"For those who enjoy some diversity in their fitness routine, this is a fun workout to have on hand. It is not easy and like other video workout routines, requires a few viewings to get acclimated. The instructor is accompanied by a fairly large group of ""students"" to simulate being in an actual ballet studio. No doubt that this DVD is dated at this point so if you need snazzy production and music, stay away from this. Music is strictly classical and production is as simple as it can get. The full workout runs over an hour and broken up into segments so you can jump to segments but there is no option to pick and choose the segments to string them together (which would have been nice). This is a total body workout but the focus is lower body. They few upper body segments are focused on crunches (not my favorite way of working the trunk), push ups, and air resistance (contracting muscles and resist). This workout does get your heart rate up and offers some nice diversity amongst the segments. However, there is a lot of floor work.

The most frustrating part for me was the choreography and the pace of the instructions. I have no prior ballet or dancing experience/training so instruction is pretty important for this workout. Although the DVD starts off with several bullets of information to ""teach"" you how to stand in ballet; there are no visuals. The cues are not great and that can make it even more frustrating for those of us that have no prior dancing experience. The last 15 or so minutes is pure choreographed ballet routines, combining many of the earlier poses and steps you have learned. I found these last segments to be nearly impossible to follow. I usually end my workout as this portion of the workout begins; the instruction was too fast and I can't keep up with fast paced choreography. I am sure with many more viewings, I could get this down but I don't have a desire to learn them. Overall, I think this is a great workout for some diversity, but I wouldn't recommend it as an essential.",1328140800,3,2024,4.545205479452055
7956768,3,B00005Y89L,"....because if I had wasted my money on that, I'd definitely bang my head on the wall! I did ballet for nearly 12 years, but had to stop due to serious injuries and I was looking for something to slightly get me back on track, so my friend gave this DVD to me.

Fact #1 : Most of this stuff you'd never do in a REAL ballet class (and trust me, I had MANY of exhausting, hard and sometimes painful ""REAL"" ones)

Fact #2 : It is NOT a DVD for absolute beginners! Yes, it is for people who know the basics of ballet and can follow a trainer easily without detailed instructions, but not for people who think a 'releve' could be a French wine.

To wrap it up: If you want a Jane Fonda aerobic inspired workout with a hint of ballet and are not looking for a REAL ballet class (which a ballet dancer actually never would call workout - at least none of my teachers ever did and I would never call it a workout either) this is what you're looking for.

For people who are looking for a classy ballet class - do not purchase this DVD or you will be bitterly disappointed!",1323216000,2,1064,4.100961538461538
7956769,4,B00005Y89L,"I have never danced ballet and for the portions that are ballet, it is definitely difficult to follow the first time.  I actually bought the Ballet Bootcamp 2 DVD, too, and I would recommend starting there if you've never danced ballet.  While I could still probably set up a camera and sell the hilarious entertainment that is me trying to dance ballet, it overall is a good and fun workout.  Much of it focuses on creating the strength and flexibility required for the ballet moves.

You can find many of those moves other places, but the soundrack is relaxing or invigorating and the fast pace never gets you bored.  The two DVDs (1&2) are among my go-to workouts and never before have I worked out for an hour or more without realizing the time was passing!

The biggest con is the lack of demonstration/instruction, especially for absolute newbies.  I suspect if you've ever had any ballet you can follow along much easier.  But, even if you haven't there are far worse ways to work out.  AND in the first week, I dropped 1 inch from my waist and 1 inch from my thighs!  (And that's no small feat!)",1284940800,3,1103,4.525252525252525
7956770,3,B00005Y89L,"I did ballet for the last 4 years before coming to college. I missed ballet and was looking for something that would help me keep up with it- and give me a workout as ballet does, from the comfort of my own room. I feel like this was made for those without any or much ballet experience. But at the same time, the way it is shot/edited at times makes it hard to follow. When a step is being demonstrated suddenly it goes to a black and white zoom on the instructor's upper body, when what you need to see is her feet! Furthermore I'm disappointed with the non-ballet muscle toning parts. It's nothing special, crunches and push up, which when I'm buying an excersive video I don't want the abdominal excersizes to be all crunches- I could come up with that on my own.

It's not awful, ther are things I like, but overall it's not as good as I was expecting.",1139011200,45,857,4.257668711656442
7956771,5,B00005Y89L,"I have been doing Taebo on and off since 1999, so I am what you would consider ""fit"". However, I didn't like what Taebo was doing to my body - i.e. making me look like Billy Blanks....so I switched to ballet, hoping it would sculpt me to look like a woman. Well! Oddly enough, I had just bought about 4 belts when I started the ballet. Within 3 weeks, all of the belts were WAY too big, and I was suddenly able to get into pants that I haven't gotten into in years. Furthermore, my extremely stubborn little belly has virtually melted away, and my arms are getting very firm. Ballet rocks! And, of the 4 videos I bought (including both NYC Ballet videos), this one is my favorite. I like the music, which changes a lot depending on the exercise (some of it is cheery, up-tempo, and some is slower, quieter). The instruction is good, but I did ballet as a child, so a lot of it comes back to me. My mom, who has never done ballet, had a hard time following the instruction the first time. If you dance with someone else, have the person who knows what they're doing stand in front of the other person. It's easier to watch a live person do the exercises than try to follow the video, if you're an absolute beginner. All in all, a wonderful workout. Highly recommended.",1132876800,59,1267,4.305439330543933
