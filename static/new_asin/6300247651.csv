268940,3,6300247651,"Good rentable flick with lots of nudity and some of the most unbelievable ghost copping-a-feel special effects you have ever seen. Hershey portrays a  victimized woman in an unimaginable situation with grace and passion.  I  would also add ""dignity"" but since she is forced to get naked  every five minutes it really doesn't apply here.  She's a classy actress  who deserved a good bit better than what she got in this screenplay.  Its  interesting how powerful the Entity is made to be, yet we are led  squeamishly but completely through the harrowing torture and repeated rape  of Hershey's character because she radiates more power than anyone else.  Its Hershey's convincing performance that makes this a level above what  could have ended up as a really schlocky horror film. Some of the scenes  are really quite harrowing and effective.  With less repetition and  gratuitous nudity (wow, am I really saying that ?) the movie's dramatic and  horrific impact would be a lot greater.",965260800,7,986,4.993827160493828
268941,5,6300247651,"THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST UNDER-RATED MOVIE OF THE POLTERGIEST REALM.  I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A KID AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED, BECAUSE THE ONLY OTHER MOVIES THAT GOT TO ME WERE, ""THE OMEN,""  AND,  ""THE EXCORCIST.""

268942,4,6300247651,"What can I say about this movie. I saw it 15 or so years ago when I was about 12. I never forgot it. I was actually scared to walk by the box in the video store. I probably WOULD have forgotten it if at the end, they hadn't told me that this was a true story and that this woman still gets  ""rogered"" by the invisible man every now and again.
Well, lo  and behold, I come home and see it on HBO yesterday - and just have to  watch it.  It was pretty much like I remember it - but of course, it wasn't  nearly as scary to a 26 year old. Although, I do have to say that the scene  in the bathroom is still pretty freaky.
Although, I  can't believe all the morons writing their reviews who keep talking about  how ""It's a true story! "" Gimme a break you idiots. This chick  gets some repeated action from an invisible blob that likes to shoot out  lightning and which you can freeze with liquid helium. And you believe it?  I'm with the Ron Silver character in this movie: Everyone is stupid and  dillusional except for me.",954979200,5,1020,4.045

269088,4,6300247651,"Based if but loosely on a true story that supposedly occurred during the 70's.
This a chilling tale telling of 'Carla Moran' (Barbara Hershey) who lives with her three children 'Billy' (David Labiosa)
'Julie' (Natasha Ryan) and 'Kim' (Melanie Griffin) who is brutally attacked and violated....
Despite a search throughout the home, 'Billy' cannot find any evidence of an intruder...
After further incidents including her car going out of control she is urged by her sister to consult a psychiatrist, which
she does.
However 'Dr Sneiderman' (Ron Silver) believes that 'Carla' is self-harming and has issues because of trauma's during
her childhood.....even after her son witnesses an attack and is indeed injured trying to help his mother the doctor and
associates still believe the problem is within her mindset.
By chance, after her sister witnesses an attack, she seeks answers at a library and comes across two parapsychologists
talking and convinces them to visit her home , after a short while they become convinced that there really is something
sinister going on....at last it seems that there are people listening to her plight.
Though 'Dr Sneiderman' try's to convince 'Carla' that it really is all in her mind she agree's to go ahead with the
parapsychologist and associates plan to conduct an experiment in order to try and trap the entity.
Though perhaps a little dated the 1981 film still manages to hold ones attention.

269470,4,6300247651,"I remember seeing this as a teen-ager and it scaring the hell out of me. That was after I realized it was based on a true story. This about 10 years or so on the heels of 'The Exorcist' so, these things were somewhat still fresh in the minds of the public. In other words, we were all still sleeping with the lights on. I had forgotten about it until recently when I was looking for paranormal/UFO movies that were based on factual cases, and it popped up on my list. It's a little dated but Barbara Hershey is still smokingly hot-especially in HD! Over the years, she's aging gracefully. I recently saw her on the 'small screen' and she hasn't changed a bit. Man, somewhere there's a lucky guy! The movie sticks close to the book of the same name and apparently, the victim still has attacks from time to time. It still retains it's creep factor-especially with Ron Silver. Man, does he play a worm! Maybe, a little too well. He definitely works the part, that's for sure. As usual, it arrived very quickly after ordering. I was surprised at how fast it came. It never ceases to amaze me about the efficiency of service I get when I order. If paranormal is your thing or your just into movies that scare instead of disgust (i.e. slashers) then this is a good fit. Like I said-it is a little dated but not enough to be hokey by any means. It is on par with 'The Exorcist'. Maybe not as terrifying, but still in the 'bump in the night' supernatural sense. I also, liked the special feature that gave you the back ground of the real incident to fill you in on the true aspects. A good a spooky flick on a stormy Saturday night.

I had never heard of this film but during a discussion of ""best horror films"", an older relative said he loved this film and that recommendation made me buy it. I'm glad I did. The film really keeps you engaged the entire time, the acting is good, the pacing is good, the effects are good and not overdone... everything works well in this film.

The DVD has a good (not pristine) transfer of video and good sound. The Blu-ray is not noticeably better, so get the DVD and save a few bucks. There are some special features, the main one being an interview with one of the real life characters that is very good... the film is based on an actual event.

This movie was frightening to me for many reasons including the fact that it was based on a true story and based on the fact that I have seen similar manifestations personally.  This movie spurred me to do some research on Dr. Barry Taff and I would recommend that anyone who is intrigued with this this story should do similar research. The movie does embellish the original story , but the embellishment is well woven into the story.  I bought the DVD version of the movie and it contained an interview with Dr. Taff , a theatrical trailer and a photo and still gallery.  This version also contained a pdf of the original screenplay which can be accessed on a computer. I have read reviews that suggest that the blue ray version of the movie issued by the same provider (Anchor Bay) , only includes the movie.  While the Blue Ray might have more visual appeal, I think that the additional material provided on the DVD is of much more value.",1453420800,,1287,4.756756756756757

269770,4,6300247651,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this supernatural thriller...

The Entity (1983) stars Barbara Hershey in the lead role as a woman with two kids who moves into a new house and then strange, disturbing things start happening to her.  I don't want to give anything away, so watch the movie and see for yourself.  This movie is one of the better ghost story/paranormal type of horror movies that I've seen.  It will creep you out for sure.  There are some rather disturbing scenes of an adult nature, but the movie is highly entertaining.  The musical score is quite different and good.  Barbara Hershey gives an outstanding performance as Carla Moran, the victimized woman.  The special effects are great.  The acting overall is great by everyone involved.

This movie is supposed to be based on a true story about someone named Doris Bither in the year 1974 in Culvar City, CA. . It was hard to watch the mother being tossed around in front of her children...how horrible for the children!  There should be a sequel to this picture entitled, ""How I Managed to Grow Up Sane After Watching my Mom be Battered and Abused by a Ghost"".

The real-life Doris was a very sad case: abused growing up, abused by lovers, had 4 children she neglected and abused, was an alcoholic and a person with an unsavory personality. Her house was a pigsty. The paranormal side of her life was mostly conjecture and photos of arcs of lights over her and around her room, and an eye-witness testimony from her eldest son, (also reporting being tossed about the room while he tried to save his mom from being attacked), and the paranormal investigators who came to her small house to try to capture some of the events.  The children all reported seeing ""entities"" and even had a name for one they called ""Whose-It"".  Just so sad to me that the children had to grow up in this environment.  Seems to me more important matters were ignored while 30+ paranormal investigators did nothing for the children but just showed up to possibly capture a ghost on camera.",1432080000,,1350,4.493877551020408

Attacks on Moran continued for years even after moving several times, decreasing in frequency and intensity over time until they finally stopped. The performances were very good and included Ron Silver as Carla's psychologist who believes its just in her head until he witnesses an event for himself.

Barbara Hershey (also stars in Insidious) stars as Carla, a single mother of 3 children, becomes victim to unforgiving entities, one large and 2 small, that terrorize her where ever she goes. The movie starts by showing the victims first encounter with the entity or entities (treating her like a rag doll and leaving nothing to the viewers imagination) and from there they break her down to the point she is no longer afraid of them but is helpless to fight back although she receives help from several sources throughout the film.

I will admit, the reason why I watched Entity was the fact the Ms. Hershey caught my attention in the very popular horror movie Insidious, her raw talent in horror films should not go unnoticed.

This movie is rather odd, but so interesting it will make you want to continue watching. A lady that has 2 children is repeatedly attacked sexually by an unseen force. The movie is basically about her seeking help from doctors that may help stop the attack by hopefully catching the unseen attacker. Is it a demon? Ghost? Invisible man? I can't tell you?!?

But the most thrilling part about the movie is the music that's played each time she is attacked, very weird music selection.

I vaguely remembered a ghost movie where they used liquid hydrogen to trap the spook, and after doing some research I rediscovered this movie.  After all these years i found this movie to still be intense and gripping.  Barbara Hershey is excellent and really conveys her character well.  Probably the weakest part of the movie is how the family just kind of accepts what is going on.  The small kids just seem to be there in the background and don't seem overly affected by anything.  The older boy is attacked and just doesn't seem to have any emotional issues afterword.  I attribute this to the genre and the time period it was made.  Also, the music is very grating especially during the attacks.  This is actually a positive because it really gets to you and makes the attacks that much more.  Of course the special effects during the ""breast"" scene are still impressive today and you'll be saying ""how did they do that?"".

270601,5,6300247651,"Barbara Hershey is never less than watchable in this intense, creepy film about one woman's struggle to overcome what might be interpreted as a series of demonic attacks. This film is able to be read upon many levels--is it her psyche, her memories of past traumas, or is there a real specter after her? One of the most frightening of all films, and definitely the best work of director Sidney J. Furie, who had only dabbled with horror themes in the past in less convicted fashion (""The Snake Woman"" is a curio, but not much else). ""The Entity"", while anything but a satire, thoroughly understands how effective that thriller stories are when they include very sad themes about the human condition, and this film has one of the saddest endings I can recall from a film (she is able to face her demon, but he's still with her, never wanting to stop terrorizing her as long as she lives). This is moving, very intense drama.
The DVD is very good indeed, with very good sound (and a creepy music score), and a quality picture presentation. The extra feature is nice, but Furie seemed a bit hesitant to do interviews about this film. Definitely a keeper. Just see it.

270653,3,6300247651,"I love slashers and 80's horror so I picked up this old supernatural thriller. I watched it along with the original Poltergeist and I still enjoyed both even though I saw them over 20 years ago. The Entity is not as tame as other films in this subgenre such as Poltergeist or Paranormal Activity because it is about a demon who repeatedly rapes a woman. She seeks help from doctors and paranormal investigators. In 2009, director Martin Scorsese placed Sidney J. Furie's The Entity (1982) on his list of the 11 Scariest Horror Films of All Time. It placed #4 on the list, above Kubrick's The Shining (1980) and Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). While the ideas explored in the film, such as trying to trap the demon in liquid helium, seem cliche now this film does manage to hold its power. It is based on a true story and the film was adapted from a book about the ordeal. The movie does hold your interest and it is well-acted. I like the techno music when the demon shows up but must admit it is overpowering and probably not to everyone's taste. Overall, the picture and audio quality are fairly average. For some reason the Blu-ray does not include the old DVD special features. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release.

270704,5,6300247651,"I discovered this on HBO one night back in the late 80's and it scared the ever lovin' hell out of me! It easily ranks right up there with the likes of 'The Haunting', 'The Exorcist' and 'The Changeling' as a ghost story that's guaranteed to raise goosebumps.

It tells the supposed real life tale of Carla Moran, played wonderfully by Barbara Hershey, an otherwise ordinary woman and single mother struggling to raise her three children who is suddenly violently attacked and sexually assaulted in her bedroom one night. But this is no ordinary case of rape, the assailant was not a human being but rather an invisible and powerful demonic force that has, for whatever reason, targeted her.

The attacks continue in both frequency and ferocity until she involves a team of paranormal investigators to help rid her and her home of this unholy spirit before it escalates any further. The film also stars Ron Silver as a well meaning but disbelieving psychologist who finds himself at odds with the parapsychologists who he believes are doing nothing but enabling her and doing her more harm than good.

The Blu-ray of the film looks fantastic, the film is presented in it;s original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 anamorphic even though the case mistakenly lists it as being 1.85:1, I mention this so that people won't panic thinking that the film is presented wrong and return their discs, rest assured the film is correctly presented.

All in all a fantastic release for a screamingly fantastic horror film, there are no extras to speak of but that's okay, the film is given a solid presentation which is all that matters.",1372636800,,1615,4.819494584837545

The first time I saw this was on TV so it was edited, but this one is not so all the scary stuff is in it. I kept the lights on after viewing, yep I confess I wimped out muwhahaha. Watch this with at least one light on, or with someone

Based on a true story Carla Moran portrayed by ( Barbara Hershey ) is the working mother of 3 kids 1 boy and 2 girls, life is normal she has her kids, friends a nice boyfriend and a happy life. Later on however the terror begins as Carla is violently raped in her bedroom not by a human but a male evil spirit. In one horrifying scene she is being raped in front of her family, when her teenage son tries to help her he is thrown across the room and shocked by what looks like lightening shocking his body and buzzes like a short circuiting electrical outlet done to him by something unseen.

A psychologist anylizes her and at first thinks that a mental disorder is causing hellucinations until she shows up with bruises one in the shape of a hand that she in no way could do to herself, and various bruises on her thighs and body. Carla is in a book store and hears two parasychologists talking about what are signs of haunting are. She tells them she has all of the signs they mentioned, they go to her house to investigate and low and behold they experience them and whole lot more. They set up equipment recording the events, and as they say all hell breaks loose and the war is on. In one part Carla is talking to someone about her family during the discussion she tells how her father used to hold her not like a father should. My friend speculates maybe her dad died and came back as an evil spirit and went after her, when you watch this you might want to have a light on",1370995200,2,1795,4.096590909090909

The thought of a ghost, and a real angry violent one at that, repeatedly violating you while you sleep has got to be the worst traumas anyone could experience. A working woman named Carla Moran, played by Barbara Hershey, whom gives a powerful performance, convincing and showing us what its like to get raped by an evil spirit. The antagonist, unchosen and unconvinced, is the ever intellectual Ron Silver as her psychiatrist, who becomes attracted to her as she reveals sexual details during therapy. Fortunately to counter the unwanted advances and angst as foes, Ms. Moran enlist the help of paranormal investigators from the local university. As Carla is desperate enough not only to stop the attacks, she risks her own life in trying to capture the entity. In ending the film, I thought it added much horror to reveal not just Carla's acceptance of the ghost, but almost an ownership and power over the entity herself as it slams the door before she leaves the room. Fading out with the final scene being the entities view of Carla and family getting in the car! To me, whats scarier than being watched from an empty house window?",1363910400,,1279,4.638766519823789

270805,4,6300247651,"I'll say two things that I never thought I'd say together: this is a movie about an invisible rapist and I thought it was good.

Based on the true story of what is considered the most extraordinary case in parapsychological history.

Our first impression is that Carla (Barbara Hershey) is a beautiful, strong, single mother wrapping up a perfectly normal day when she is beaten and raped by an invisible assailant.  However, after this traumatic event, she is rendered an understandably fragile and terrified wreck.

With the advent of a second ""event"" of sorts, she's scaring her children and appearing insane to her teenage son, who doesn't understand what's going on...but, really, neither does Carla.  She confides in her supportive friend who advises she see a psychiatrist and even stays with her to help her feel safe.

That's not good enough, though.  The ""entity"" strikes when she's in the car, causing her to crash, she finally sees Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver), who doesn't seem to find Carla's claims credible but works hard to help her get to the bottom of it.

Eventually her teenager witnesses such an assault and is thrown across the room and held at bay by the entity--making a believer out of him.  As things escalate, a team of university parapsychologists get involved much to Dr. Sneiderman's disapproval.  As Sneiderman's disapproval mounts, Carla regains her confidence and mental fortitude.  This is designed, and designed well, to force us to question whether Sneiderman is actually an antagonist or protagonist in this story.

So the question remains:  is she nuts and the victim of her own psychological projections, or is she actually being raped by an entity of something other than her own creation?

This movie has several faux rape scenes.  They may be intense for more sensitive viewers, but they're tastefully approached--as ""tasteful"" as a rape scene can be--in the capacity that you don't see an assailant during these scenes.

There wasn't much in the way of special effects.  They were poor light show displays like crackling electricity.  Except they did a great job of showing that she was being fondled by something invisible.

A movie about ghost rape...and it was good.  Give it a chance, folks.",1363478400,4,2238,5.013550135501355

270866,5,6300247651,"I have been watching horror films since I was six years old and am a huge fan of the genre having watched thousands ranging from rare horror to mainstream, out of all the horror movies I have viewed only a few have left me with an extremely creepy uneasy feeling afterwards, The Entity happens to be one of them. Surprisingly I just discovered this film a few years ago and it has quickly become one of my number one recommendations to people looking for a ""scary"" movie.

The story is terrifying, especially if you are able to Immerse yourself in the story without constant distractions, I suggest watching the film in total darkness with a good sound system or headphones even better, turn your phone off and don't constantly step away from the movie if you want to get as immersed as possible! The soundtrack will certainly make your heart race during certain scenes! As I mentioned earlier, the story left me with a strange uneasy feeling for a couple days after watching the movie for the first time and I haven't had that type of feeling from a horror film since I was a kid! You truly feel the hopelessness and terror of the lead character, Carla. I would find myself drifting off thinking about the film days after watching it with that same uneasy feeling!

I also found the ""scientific"" element of the Parapsychology team interesting, and then we also have the late and great Mr. Ron Silver in one of his earlier film roles, he does a great job as usual.

I see people bashing the effects or saying the movie is ""dated"", In my opinion the effects help add to the realism of the movie. As far as being dated, the movie was made in the early 80's, but looks very good even compared to many modern films! The look, feel and style help set the mood if you will allow it without trying to act ""hip"" by criticizing anything not new or flooded with CGI...compare the effects of A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 to the 2010 remake and you'll likely see what I mean, CGI sometimes has a strange subconscious effect of making it feel too fake in my opinion briefly bringing me out of the immersion.

So, if you will allow yourself the opportunity to step inside this movie I am fairly confident you will walk away with a feeling of dread. As mentioned earlier, don't watch it for the first time during the day or with distractions, to get the most out of The Entity watch it preferably alone with a good sound system or headphones(awesome for blocking out distracting noises and will let you is ten at a higher volume without waking anyone else), late at night with no lights on, no phone, iPad or laptop to distract you and don't keep pausing the movie...I promise, you won't regret it, if I could get as unnerved from it with how hardened I am from literally watching Horror for over 30 years, I'm sure you can if you will do as I suggested.

I have the movie in DVD and Blu Ray, buy the DVD...the Blu Ray has NO Special Features, not even a menu which is just ridiculous, the picture and sound upgrade isn't good enough to justify the higher cost OR the lack of a menu or any features.

Stay Scared,

270899,5,6300247651,"This is one hell of scary movie that's *based on a true story*! This movie is quite faithful to the storyline of the written account (see reading list below). Right after ""The Exorcist"", this story ranks high in my list of collections based on TRUE accounts of afflicted victims.

This movie is definitely NOT for children and has some very disturbing contents!

Read this out-of-print book first before watching this movie:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Entity/dp/0446301361/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Entity</a>

The book will give you an idea on this horrifying case that was left UNSOLVED.
That is the most frustrating part of this particular case! This case file remains unsolved, and the victim was made to suffer all the way without ANY workable solutions provided for her by all her supposed friends and silly doctors, etc.!

I'm scrutinizing the written account again to spot how and why the victim came to be in the state that she was in. The victim is probably dead by now, but she would be an interesting research project.

Pills won't help the victim as she was NOT psychotic. Those looney doctors were unbelievers in the supernatural, and they couldn't fight another plane with ordinary tools of mundane ""science"" that only operate on one tangible plane. I don't like to see cases like these go unsolved.

IMO, this is what should have been provided for the victim back in the 1970s:

There is a large group of collectors who are upgrading their DVD's to Blu Ray. Not only did Anchor Bay Entertainment not include the extras from the DVD release. They also over-looked, failed, didn't care... to include a menu.

I'm sorry but there is something really wrong with this. I am a consumer and quality means everything to me. A product with no quality behind it is a poor product. I may be crazy but what good is product if it doesn't match the quality and or capability of the device (Blu Ray) it's playing on?

I may be the only (from reading other reviews) to not consent to this product, I hope not. I've returned this item as they (Anchor Bay Entertainment, Amazon.com) should have cared at least enough to include (confirm) a menu. Or had a little more concern about me (Mr. Consumer), that, why would I accept a Blu Ray disc without a menu! Is this a test like Apple does to see if consumers will consent to purchasing anything?

Now, with the blu ray release of ""The Entity"", we get nothing...not even a MENU!!! I have heard that the DVD re-release has the documentary and bonus features from the previous release...but they can't give the blu ray so much as a MENU???!!?!?! If anything, the blu ray should follow suit of other studios and allow MORE than the DVD due to the storage capacity.

270999,4,6300247651,"In what turned out to be one of the 1980s best ""ghost"" stories, Barbara Hershey turns in a killer performance as a mother who is stalked, raped, and then pursued, by an entity in her own home.  A team of scientists and paranormal experts become involved after the police believe her to be delusional.  They do too, until...

Well, this takes a particularly devastating toll on her family, and Barbara Hershey creates a strong willed female lead, and part of the success of the horror is not always with the presence of a poltergeist, but by the sheer rawness and grittiness of the torture Hershey goes through.  This draws a unique sense of a sympathy that is not found in many horror films, and that is part of the reason why the shocks still hit home.

The previous release to own was also released through Anchor Bay, who do justice to most every horror release they take care of-  when they're not bum copies.  This Blu-ray is far from that.  This is a great release for Blu-Ray, as fans have been waiting a while for this movie to come out.  The picture is clear, but it never ruins the atmosphere of the film. A film can never lose the feeling of its era, and this is the 80s, and the audience still feels that.  It is not like the ghost stories of the 70s, but, in many ways, it holds it own with the classics that predate it.  Buyers will be satisfied with the transfer and the bit rate.

I used to see the film on late night television movie networks back in the day.  Still has its scares.  Fans of Barbara Hershey and 80s horror flicks will already know, and they will be pleased.  The Entity is back.",1338076800,19,1612,4.344481605351171
271000,4,6300247651,"Night after night, it takes her against her will and has its way with her until the day she started fighting back.

  Yeah I know it sounds corny but I couldn't help myself without giving The Entity the Lifetime treatment tagline.

  Seriously, though, this is a pretty scary movie aided with a really strong performance by Barbara Hershey. She plays Carla Morran, a single mother of three living in a lower middle class suburb and trying to better herself and family by taking a few night courses at the community college. One night, while getting ready for bed, she is inexplicably attacked and assaulted by some unseen force. The attacks continued until she finally convinces a pair of skeptical parapsychologists that she is in fact being raped by a ghost. Together with a team of twenty students, this unlikely trio of Ghostbusters try to uncover the truth behind the ghostly attacks and possibly end the Entity's reign of terror.

  I really must admit that the story behind the movie is even scarier though I do have trouble believing a lot of it.  First off, the real woman (""Doris"") had a tragic history of physical as well as sexual abuse which she supposedly never sought treatment for in her later years. Then there's the fact that she drank like a fish and treated her three sons like crap while intoxicated and, in turn, her sons felt a lot of rage towards her. There is also a possible link to repressed sexual desires towards her eldest son who was between 16 and 18 at the time the attacks first manifested.  She went on by saying that the Entity was actually three spirits; the two smaller ones would hold her down while the larger one, the one in charge, would then begin the rape. So you got 3 spirits (each one representing her sons), drinking, and a traumatic past all colliding together in an explosion of psychokinetic energy. But this is only my theory and I'm no shrink or paranormal investigator.

  As a whole the movie is a good one. The SFX leave a lot to be desired but what do yo expect from a low budget movie from the early 80s?  By far Barbara Hershey is the stand out here. She plays Carla as a very strong woman who is forced to undergo some real fantastical extremes in an attempt to reclaim personal possession. Ron Silver, on the other hand, plays a pretty sleazy character in my opinion. I didn't trust or like him the moment he came on screen the first time nor has that feeling change over subsequent viewings over the years. You can tell he doesn't care about her. To him its all about the publishing and the credit this case will provide him with. I was actually hoping that in the end the Entity would leave Carla alone and start raping him.

  The first 2/3 of movie is really strong but that strength seems to vanish during the last act of the film where the team tries to recreate Carla's house in a gymnasium of all places in an attempt to lure and trap the Entity by freezing it. Then we only find out that after this failed disaster, the ghost followed Carla back home and THE END. All this and the movie just ends. For this poorly concieved ending, I'm deducting a star but its still a powerful scary movie that may leave a few of the uninitiated a few sleepless nights. Unfortunately, the disc has once again returned to the realm of OOP dvds and a few sellers are attempting to rape your wallets with extremely over the top prices. I recommend you buy this only if you can find a copy for under $20. I know its out there because I just bought my copy for only $8.50 at a Book and Movie Exchange this past Wednesday. Maybe with the upcoming remake, Starz/ Anchor Bay will re-release it at a more affordable rate like they did with Night of the Demons and Hell Night.

271003,5,6300247651,"I remember this movie when it first released in 1981. Actually, more accurately, I never forgot it. For years it stayed in the back of my mind. At one point, I wanted to locate it again but, on DVD instead of the old VHS format I first had it on. For the most part, about all I could seem to find out was that it was or, nearly was, out of print and difficult to locate. I did finally locate it again and purchase it, right here on amazon.com.

And a lot of the reason I decided to hunt this movie down again was because of the powerful story I remember it being. And a powerful story it is indeed. Of course, as most who have seen this film know, it is supposedly based on actual, true events. This may or may not be but, a powerful story none-the-less. And another reason I wanted to hunt this film down again is because of the one and only Barbara Hershey. As Carla Moran in the film, she gives it her all. Miss Hershey could easily have been nominated for Best Actress Award, in my opinion. That probably wouldn't happen though mainly because, the subject matter is considered a bit obscure or unbelievable and as such, the film as a whole would not be taken seriously. But whether you believe this to be a true story or not, the film does deliver on all counts (aside from the somewhat weakened ending, which is where the film does lose steam). And as for Miss Hershey, who will forever remain one of the most under-rated actresses, yet one of my lifelong favorites, no one, in my opinion, could have done a better job as Carla Moran than she did. As always, I tip my hat to Barbara Hershey.",1328486400,2,1596,4.25

271026,4,6300247651,"This rich little horror film about a single mother being repeatedly and inexplicably raped in her middle-class California home by an invisible incubus has been repeatedly dismissed as an exploitation film. but its much more thoughtful than that. The attacks on Carla Moran (the excellent Barbara Hershey) are too sudden, violent, and shocking to be played for salaciousness. There's much that's left teasingly ambiguous about why the poltergeist attacks her, and the psychologist (Ron Silver) who examines her wants to tie things too quickly and neatly to her history of childhood abuse and failed relationships. But the film repeatedly gives us epistemological proof of Carla's attacks (we see them as they happen), so it's like Edmund Wilson's famous critical optic for the Turn of the Screw"" exactly in reverse: we KNOW the ghosts are real, and the critics who think otherwise (i.e. Silver and his psychiatrist mentor, whom we come to learn is ethically corrupt) are exactly wrong. Indeed, the psychiatric board who examine Carla seem to wish her almost as much ill as the spirit attacking her. Like all the better horror stories, the ghost is here a figuration for something else menacing its culture; here (as so often) it's about the problems a independent sexually active woman poses to her male-dominated culture, and vice-versa. The confusions of the ghost with Carla's lover (Alex Rocco), her nearly adult son, and her psychiatrist occur too repeatedly and frequently to be mere coincidence. The film is helped enormously by Hershey's strong performance, and hurt by its special effects, which were inferior even for the time.",1300060800,3,1636,5.200757575757576

271028,4,6300247651,"The Entity (Sidney J. Furie, 1981)

The Entity is not Sidney J. Furie's best-known film. It's not even his best. It hasn't shown up on any critical thousand-best lists (as has The Ipcress File), nor was it nominated for a veritable slew of Oscars (as was Lady Sings the Blues). But for all that, I'll tell you something--in The Entity, Furie did something that it seems directors have forgotten how to do in the ensuing thirty years; he gave us a horror film that is entirely humorless. And I don't mean that in a bad way. Horror film directors have been leavening horror with humor as long as horror films have been around, on the theory that horror hits you that much harder when you were just laughing. I subscribed to it, too, but The Entity, which I watched last night for the first time in about twenty-five years, is hard evidence that starting off scary and staying there can be just as effective.

It takes this movie about five minutes to kick in. We first see a bit of the daily life of Carla Moran (Looking for Mr. Goodbar's Barbara Hershey), a quick montage of her job and the night class she takes to learn to type. Then she goes home...and is attacked by something we can't see. She is raped, though the camera, the first time, is artfully-placed enough that we don't know this until she confides it to her friend Cindy (The Italian Job's Margaret Blye) a couple of days later. The attacks continue, and she notifies the authorities despite knowing how crazy she'll sound. This brings her into contact with two conflicting groups. One is the skeptical medical doctors, the most visible face of which is Phil Sneiderman (the late Ron Silver), a Freudian psychiatrist who believes it's all in her head. The other is headed by Dr. Cooley (The Naked Gun 2 's Jacqueline Brookes), top dog in the same university's nascent department of parapsychology, who believe there's an actual evil entity stalking her. Meanwhile, the attacks continue, each one increasing in brutality (and each more graphically-depicted).

According to Frank de Felitta, who wrote both the screenplay and the novel upon which it is based, The Entity is a ""fictionalized account of a true story"". I think we've all heard that enough to know that it means there's a kernel of truth somewhere hidden way down in a mass of fiction, but hearing it still kind of sets your teeth on edge. This is a movie where every last detail is designed to make the viewer as uncomfortable as possible. Pretty impressive for a guy who doesn't often direct horror films (he did a couple in the early sixties, and then this one; his output since has been almost entirely comedies and thrillers). Not just the attacks themselves, but everything. Her kids. Sneiderman's absolute obsession with sex (which turns even creepier when he falls for her, which is inevitable). Cindy's husband, whose boorishness always seems as if it's going to explode into violence. Even the color schemes of some of the sets are just off enough to keep you on edge. The movie does have a few drawbacks (most notably its running length, which modern audiences used to Miramax's ""ninety minutes tops"" horror films will find well-nigh unbearable) and it looks and sounds dated, but it is still an effective, chilling horror film that deserves to be rediscovered. *** ",1294963200,5,3302,4.7473867595818815

After repeated similar attacks (one while she's driving!), Hershey seeks help from para-psychologists. Having Tobe Hooper's more mainstream and slick ""Poltergeist"" come out on this movie's heels certainly wasn't good for its legacy, and promoting the film as a true story didn't wash with skeptics, but having an actress of Hershey's caliber at the film's center was a superlative move; her presence alone makes the film absorbing and provocative. Appearing like a grown-up flower child, with a likably tossled hairdo and lifestyle, Hershey slips right into these outlandish goings-on with nonchalant ease. The effects are quite good (relying upon tight editing and fine cinematography), and the climactic events don't cop out. This thriller goes in all the directions you're hoping it will, and it is never less than satisfying. 'B'",1167264000,5,973,5.407894736842105

271163,4,6300247651,"The Entity (1981), a fictionalized account based on a `true' incident, relates a tale of how a single mother in California suffered brutal attacks by unseen forces.  Taken from the popular novel by Frank De Felitta and directed by Sidney J. Furie (The Ipcress File, Iron Eagle, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace), the film stars Barbara Hershey (Hoosiers, Tin Men).  Also appearing is Ron Silver (Silkwood), George Coe (The Omega Code), Margaret Blye (Mischief), Jacqueline Brookes (Ghost Story), Richard Brestoff (The Man with Two Brains), Raymond Singer (Feds), Alex `Moe Green' Rocco (The Godfather), Natasha Ryan (The Amityville Horror), Melanie Gaffin (Armed and Dangerous), and David Labiosa, whom many may be familiar with from his appearance as the character of Antonio the busboy from the ""Seinfeld"" episode The Busboy.

Carla Moran (Hershey) is a single mother, who works during the day and goes to school at night, drives a funky car and lives in a funky rental house with her three children.  After returning home one night she suffers a brutal, penetrating attack by an unseen aggressor, one that's real enough to her to believe her attacker is a corporeal being in the house (he's not).  Her oldest son Bill (Labiosa) writes it off as a bad dream, but the amorous, groping, invisible entity soon returns on a regular basis causing Carla to think she possibly losing her marbles, to which she seeks professional help from a psychiatrist named Dr. Sneiderman (Silver).  As Sneiderman begins probing Carla's background he believes the attacks are all apart of some delusion, stemming from her sketchy past, but the incidents continue and grow in intensity, eventually witnessed by others around Carla, including her children (at one point she suffers various bruises and bite marks upon her body).  Eventually a disillusioned Carla, after a falling out with Sneiderman, comes into contact with a couple of university funded parapsychologists named Gene (Brestoff) and Joe (Singer) who later witness some of the strangeness, and they agree to get involved not only to document the powerful force but to also help Carla, much to Dr. Sneiderman annoyance who thinks such intervention by those he presumes quacks will only feed the delusion.  Anyway, as the unusual activity continues the parapsychologists look for a way to isolate and immobilize the force, resulting in a grand and elaborate experiment in a university gymnasium where they use a willing Carla as the bait (once Sneiderman gets wind of what's going on, he flips his proverbial lid and tries to intervene), the hope being to capture that force which they believe to have crossed over from another plane of existence (apparently looking for a good time).

I'm not a big believer in the supernatural but I am perfectly willing to admit there's a lot of stuff going on out there that we, for some reason or another, just can't explain.  Whether or not part or most of what's relating in this film actually occurred I do not know, but it certainly made for an interesting and unnerving film, especially if you like well developed ghost stories with an intellectual slant.  I thought Ms. Hershey did a really wonderful job portraying a woman fighting to keep her wits, struggling to come to terms with those who would have her believe her very real experiences were all just a product of her fractured mind.  One aspect of the film I really enjoyed was the animosity displayed between the established medical community, represented by Dr. Sneiderman, and the pseudo science of the paranormal, represented mainly by Gene and Joe, whom, by the way, were a real couple of nerdlingers (check out the scene when they're in Carla's bedroom and some static electricity appears in the air...the both dive for the floor in fright).  There's one sort of funny scene when Sneiderman's in a staff meeting with his peers with Carla present, and after she leaves nearly everyone lights up (one guy's smoking a pipe, another a cigar, and most of the rest pull out cigarettes).  I'm not entirely sure why I found this humorous, but perhaps it has something to do with seeing all these medical professionals engaging in an activity we now know to be detrimental to one's health.  Anyway, I thought the film, which ran just over two hours, was pretty solid all the way around, including the flow of the story, the special effects (which were understated enough to appear real), the performances, and the direction.  Furie and his cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (The Untouchables, Mission: Impossible) did employ some interesting camera slanted angle shots and tight close ups, most likely to create a heightened sense of tension, and they usually worked, on me at least.  As I said the film runs just over two hours, and I thought the time was used well.  The only element I thought a little off was the ending, during the grand experiment meant to try and capture the entity.  I won't go into specifics but despite not being familiar with the source material, I highly doubt this `Ghostbusters' sequence was something that actually took place.  Most likely it was a spectacular element tacked on to the film in an effort to provide a whiz-bang of a finale.  It was interesting, but it felt at odds with the rest of the story in terms of up until that point there felt a certain sense of disturbing realism steeped in the fantastic, whereas the ending moved into the realm of the ultra fantastic.  I did like their train of thought in as far as how they were planning to capture the entity, but, again, it didn't seem to fit well with everything that occurred previously given most of what's depicted is supposedly culled from actual events.  That's not to say the ending ruined the film, but only that it takes away slightly from everything else that came before.

The picture on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes through very well.  Extras include a newly created and entertaining documentary titled The Entity Files (27:28) featuring a real life parapsychologist named Dr. Barry Taff who shares some of his experiences (he was involved in the true life events from which provide the basis of the film), a theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, and an original screenplay accessible as a DVD-ROM feature.

271214,4,6300247651,"This was a disturbing tale about a woman who suffers supernatural attacks.  On a deeper level, it is about her finding strength to persevere through sexual assault (albeit from a spirit) and culture's refusal to take her seriously.  The feminist undertones are fitting for the period's waning of the initial movement and the attacks the movement saw in the early 80s.  And fitting for our current era, as well.  As one reviewer pointed out, the camera's refusal to focus on some of the male characters makes the viewer know that we are to dismiss the men's arrogance as easily as they dismissed this woman.

I had no intention of writing a review, but I found some reviews to be disturbing in themselves.  The fact that several people mentioned they found the rape scenes to be funny makes a sad comment on our culture.  Sure, it was a ghost...sure, it was a chessy special effect... but just sad when people (and I hope not just my male gender) found this funny.  Empathy, people!!  The scenes are graphic, but the violence and nudity are not grotesque.  Barbara Hershey was not 'taken advantage of' as one kid review mentioned (why does Amazon let children comment on R movies?  As if they understand mature sexuality- most adults can't deal with it!...if they are 'embarrassed' by nudity, then pipe down!).  Instead, it showed pretty amazing strength to film a movie that could have tanked given 1982's social climate.  Kudos to the filmmakers and Barbara Hershey.",1151452800,6,1467,4.82

On the surface this is a recipe for an exploitative and cheap movie but to be fair to the makers of The Entity they have brought a touch of restraint and quality to the treatment ,although it still contains scenes likely to offend many -as when the possessed womans breasts are fondled by the unseen being .I suspect the script being by Frank de Felitta,the author of the source novel ,has something to do with the relative dignity of proceedings

Barbara Hershey is superb as the suburban housewife sexually asaulted by the invisible presence .She is in viruallly every frame and rises wonderfully to the challenge of the role .

The relentless assaults wear her down and she is disbelieved by all but her children ,headed by Billy her son ( David Labiosa) and by her best friend (Margaret Blye).Her psychiatrist -an irritating and self opinionated jerk (Ron Silver) tries to get her to enter mental hospital and opposes the attempt of a group of university parapsychologists ,lead by Doctor Cooley the head of the parapsychology department to help her by trapping the entity  .Indeed the shrink's  intervention is to bring disaster in its wake

  The acting is top notch. Barbara Hershy is fantastic, hands down! The material is treated incredibly seriously and it contains some great music and truly moody cinematography!

271254,5,6300247651,"When I first watched this movie, I was really skeptical... the whole premise of the movie was about a woman played by Barbara Hershey who claimed to be raped and beaten by ghosts (two would hold her down and one would rape her). But I watched the movie because it was indeed entertaining and if anything, it made you think and challenged the mind. But the more I watched it, the more disturbing it got. There are parts of the movie where you can see invisible hands fondling her breasts and her being physically attacked by an unknown ""thing"".

After watching the movie, I did a lot of online research to find out how true the movie was... and come to find out, the real woman's name was Carlotta Moran in Culver City, CA (which isn't too far from me) and it made news all over the place. There are documented facts from scientists, parapsychologists, and several neutral bystanders who have witnessed various one of the apparitions that attacked her.

The only part of the movie that wasn't really ""real"" was the ending where they capture the ghost. In the end, the entity was never truly captured and the real woman had to move five different times and it still followed her. She was raped 15 times during a 10-week DOCUMENTED investigation. The good news is that the entity eventually stopped following her after two years of a terrible ordeal and she would move further and further away from her home.

Here's something interesting:
In real life, the lady was being raped while screaming in her bedroom. Her 16-year-old son walked in and saw his mother being assaulted on the bed and tried to stop the ghost. He ended up being thrown across the room and broke his arm. When the scene was recreated in the movie, the ACTOR broke the VERY same arm doing that very same scene re-enacted. That's eerie.

The movie, as a whole... is not a horror movie. But it is very mentally disturbing because it really happened... credible people witnessed it. Whether you believe or don't.. doesn't really matter. But it's worth watching simply as a conversation piece. Definite five stars (even though it is VERY low budget and kinda cheesy) for originality.",1115251200,121,2146,4.669312169312169

Hershey is splendid in this role but Ron Silver doesn't match with her . She needed a counter figure much more heavy weight expressive as Chritopher Walken or Rutger Hauger for instance .

THEY AREN'T! Those that I have just listed are some of the scariest movies ever placed on screen. Anyway, this is allegedly based on a true story, it's about a girl who is raped repeatedly by a ghost. This will probably offend catholics. This movie is scary, but if you don't like movies that don't get to the point in the first 5 minutes of the movie, than this isn't the movie for you.

271302,4,6300247651,"The Entity was one of my favorite scary movies; one of the reasons is that it was based on a factual account of another's life.  Imagine being that woman, the horrors she must have faced, and the terror she still must be facing.  I think that Barbara Hershey did a wonderful job portraying in this role.  The effects for that time were done very well, especially when the hands were touching her and you could actually see the imprints on her skin.  It surely left chills up my spine.  I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD.  One of your previous reviewers from Greenville, SC USA said,"" This movie had great acting, intriguing story, and good music, but it is not even the least bit scary or disturbing. I really think it had potential, but it was way too predictable. If you thought it was scary, well whatever. I didn't think it was scary. If you want real scary get The Other (not The Others), The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot, Pet Cemetery, or Evil Dead"". That person needs to realize the difference between the Gore factors and the Fear factors. His/her opinion is fine if your looking for blood and gore then this movie isn't for you.  I found this movie to be more of a suspense/drama/thriller.  So, if you are looking for blood and gore like (i.e.: Troma type movies) than this movie isn't what you'll be getting.  So, Mr./Ms. Greenville, SC USA should really reevaluate his or her perspective before giving an opinion on movie genre's and not compare suspense and fear flicks with blood and gore....it just isn't appropriate.",1032393600,21,1562,4.630434782608695
271333,5,6300247651,"Look out, folks, fasten your seatbelts. Like ""The Exorcist"", ""The Entity"" is based upon a drama that really happened, in Los Angeles. This is an excellent and very underrated terror movie that can easily make ""Poltergeist"" (released this same year 1982) look like a fairy tale. This story of a young and attractive woman, regularly sexually attacked by an invisible 'entity' is so believable, so realistic that we can't be nothing else but terrified, really chilled, from the beginning to the ending.
There is not any failed element in this movie, everything is perfect, from the special effects by Joe Lombardi and Stan Winston to the directing and self-adaptation, through the performance of always excellent Barbara Hershey - who won the Prize as Best Actress in Avoriaz Film Festival, in 1983 - in one of her best roles, and also Ron Silver's, perfect as the stubborn shrink. The chilling soundtrack is also ideal. But the movie is also remarkable because (and on the contrary of ""Poltergeist""), it never tells us about the nature of this entity, we never know if it's a ghost, or a demon, or something else, even not a poltergeist... In the end the entity is neutralized, with liquid helium, but manages to escape and the film leaves us, filled up with questions with no response, exciting our imagination. This makes ""The Entity"" much more interesting to most of the poor, too predictible horror movies we can see today.
Another question with no response: where's the DVD? I'm very surprised because in France, there is a DVD edition of this movie...",1027036800,12,1556,4.8977272727272725
271334,5,6300247651,"I saw a part of this movie when I was a lot younger maybe six or seven and I remember I couldn't watch anymore of it because it scared me. All I saw was this woman screaming and being thrown all over the place by an unseen evil. I didn't even know what was going on. Almost 20 years later I rented The Entity to watch it in it's entirety.
Barbara Hershey stars as a single mother, with a checkered past, trying to raise her son and two daughters. One night as she's getting ready to go to bed an unseen force throws her across the room and smothers her with a pillow while raping her. She has no idea what has just happened and believes someone must've broken into the house. Upon finding that there was no entry into the house she believes maybe it's some sort of demon. At first she's hesitant to seek psychiatric help but after a second attack in her car she believes she has no alternative. She begins seeing a psychiatrist (Ron Silver).  He tries to help by having her go into great detail about her past, telling her that these attacks are all in her mind. However, the more details she drudges up, the more frequent and violent the attacks become.
The movie is over 2 hours long so I could talk about the story forever. The Entity is powerful, mysterious and intense right up until the ending, which I thought was frustrating and a disappointment. I also thought that the music was perfect in this movie especially during the attack scenes. It is a highly intensive flick, it's definitely NOT for younger viewers. I guess the frightening thing about this movie is that was based on a true story. Whatever it is, The Entity is definitely worth seeing and I'm sure it's a movie you won't soon forget.",1024963200,40,1705,4.3955696202531644
271335,4,6300247651,"The Entity is not a great movie. It tends to drag throughout much of the second half and the ending was a disappointment in my opinion. However, this movie continues to scare the heck out of me! Now I have seen many a horror flick and not many of them succeed in generating so much as a shiver. But for some reason, this movie really scares me. The scene where Barbara Hershey is first attacked by the unseen Entity while lying on her bed, the horrible scene where she is literally molested by invisible hands, and the chilling voice that welcomes her home after her climactic encounter with the violent poltergeist continues to send chills down my spine.

271340,4,6300247651,"It's an older movie made before effects or technology for visual effects were really good. For the time i think they did a pretty...good job. Based on a true story just makes it even scarier. what scares me even more is that supposedly the attacks are still going on and this Entity is following her around. Spooky and Freaky this movie definetly is, you HAVE to consider the time period it was made in. To me it's a classic. I can't wait till the DVD version comes out. Hopefully we'll get a full blown documentary on it as an added feature, or even an update on the story it was based on. Excellent movie !",1004659200,2,608,4.2956521739130435
271341,1,6300247651,"My friends rented this to watch one night (they always pick the worst movies- every time) and yes, we know rape's not funny, but we couldn't help laughing at most of the movie. Why is it getting 4 1/2 stars? This is bad. The little girls weren't even good enough to act in a bad commercial, the music sounded like some early childhood Trent Reznor project, the actor who played the son was a cheeseball and wore nothing but booty shorts, the psychiatrist guy was a total jerk and really annoyed me, Barbara Hershey overacted, the plot was totally obvious (if it gets too boring and quiet in comes the ""scary"" music and you know she's gonna get assaulted in one way or another), not to mention the grody fake body they used when she was getting felt up by the ghost (but when you realize this was 1982, the effect was pretty good).

271342,4,6300247651,"Tales of the supernatural are some of the hardest to make effective and believable. ""The Entity"" doesn't really accomplish both of these things to its full potential, but man is it great! Barbara Hershey turns in a very heartfelt performance as a single mom who's had some pretty traumatic experiences in her life that are the basis for her shrink's accusations of delusions when she begins to feel some sort of entity sexually assault her in her own house. The sequences of rape by an un-earthly force are extremely effective, and the pitter-patter in between isn't bad, either. In my opinion the doctor played by Ron Silver completely underminds the movie in a way that's indescribably annoying, but it's the strength of the Hershey character, the incredible special effects, and the shocking nature of the rape sequences that put this movie over the top. I loved it. However, a word of warning to the squeamish: If ""The Accused"" disturbed you, this will tear your nerves to shreds.",981072000,7,984,4.8982035928143715
