2056180,4,B00022EEDK,"This is a marvelous look at Elizabeth Taylor in tip top form doing a wickedly acid portrayal of Louella Parsons. Hatred for Parsons, that must have been real, oozes from her every pore.",1267315200,,185,4.636363636363637
2056181,4,B00022EEDK,Fantastic actesses telling it like it use to be in Hollywood.  All the gossip and what went on behind closed doors.  Everyone from Louie B Mayer to Clark Gable are part of this film.  Very interesting in view of today's Entertainment channels and Enquirer movie coverage.,1256342400,,271,4.8478260869565215
2056182,5,B00022EEDK,This is an excellent movie. The 2 main characters are great at being fighting friends. They are both witches with a B.,1205107200,2,118,4.409090909090909
2056183,5,B00022EEDK,This a a great movie about two notorious nasty gossip columnists during Hollywood's golden era starring Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Alexander. It's a must see!!!,1126742400,5,159,5.4
2056184,4,B00022EEDK,"great little story of some history of the hollywood gossip machine back in the day. thought jane alexander did her part of hedda hopper great,  also elizabeth taylor was great, she knew both of the women so her take on luella parsons was very good also she did her speaking like luella did, this is a fun movie",1379894400,,310,4.344827586206897
2056185,2,B00022EEDK,"I thought Elizabeth,s part was not acted well . The story line was not good, Elizabeth was a Reporter who was put on a pedistal. Jane Alexander did a better job acting her role as a Reporter. This is not one of Elizabeth,s better movies.",1372550400,,237,4.288888888888889
2056186,5,B00022EEDK,"I saw this movie a long time ago and looked for it since, it's great! This movie has a lot of fine quality to it.i am a fan of old Hollywood movies",1367193600,,147,3.625
2056187,5,B00022EEDK,"This is an entertaining story about two competitive gossip columnists, famous in their day, Luella Parsons and Hedda Hopper.  I do not know how accurate it is, but it is based on facts.  Elizabeth Taylor comes across as fawning, condescending, manipulating, and yet at the same time seems insecure and dependent; I've never seen her perform in any other role exactly like this.  She is a talent.  Jane Alexander does an excellent portrayal as Hedda Hopper, and done in a way that  identifies her as a survivalist in the challenging industry of the movie world.
  Do not confuse this movie with others of the same name which are not even based on the same story; this is different than those.",1359331200,,691,4.708333333333333
2056188,5,B00022EEDK,"The great Liz Taylor is at her best is this wonderful move about Hollywood gosip divas, Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons!  There are some great bitchy lines thrown thrown back and forth between Liz Taylor as Louella and Jane Alexander as Hedda.  Get this movie!!  You'll LOVE IT!!!",1356825600,,281,4.8125
2056189,5,B00022EEDK,"Made for TV, this film is a MUST for anyone who wants to know how things were behind the scenes during the Golden Age of Hollywood.  Louella Parsons & Hedda Hopper were the Dear Abby & Ann Landers of motion picture critics.  Portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Alexander, the two had a love-hate relationship until they joined forces to take on the movie studios and their publishers.  This film chronicles those events, most enjoyably.  Don't expect Elizabeth as seen in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" or ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" but viewers will find ""Malice in Wonderland"" enjoyable, anyway.  Don't miss this!!",1355875200,,618,4.847619047619047
2056190,5,B00022EEDK,I will definitely buy this. I didn't know it existed. When I saw the movie on TV I was fascinated by Taylor's performance. In my view it is one of her best. She clearly hated Parsons with a fury and her imitation of her is marvelous. Marvelously malevolent.,1324080000,2,257,4.375
2056191,5,B00022EEDK,"Fans of Elizabeth Taylor have sought out this film on home video for years and -if you look at the prices being asked for old VHS copies - you'll see that there is still a need to have it released. Arny Schorr - a former Rhino exec, who created S'more Entertainment a few years ago to reissue on DVD many out of print titles - is giving fans what they want with this new DVD release - at a fair price.

This is the story of the battle between 1940s and 50s gossip columnists Louella Parsons (Elizabeth Taylor, in one of her best roles late in her career) and Hedda Hopper (Jane Alexander, who seems to turn her personality way too quickly but is almost as ""catty"" as Taylor as the film proceeds)  and was made by ITV to air on TV in 1985. It covers the years 1928 through 1944 and much of it takes place on the huge MGM lot. Both Taylor and Alexander hold the screen which nice supporting work by Richard Dysart (who many will remember as the head partner on ""L.A. Law"") as studio head L.B. Mayer and even a small role by Tim Robbins (early in his career) as actor Joseph Cotton. Fans of Hollywood lore will enjoy seeing ""re-creations"" of such famous folks as Bing Crosby, Clark Gabel and Orson Welles. (This was the period when he was making ""Citizen Kane""). The budget for costumes was obviously high.

The film is ""based on actual events"" and there's a bit of Hollywood lore here. The film starts slow but it's at the one-hour mark that the claws come out and the dialogue has some of the juiciest barbs in this battle to be the ""nosiest gossip columnist"" reaches its peak.

The print is near perfect. The exterior scenes have a bit more sepia than the inside ones - but that's the way it was filmed. There are chapter stops but no bonus materials. (After all, this was made for TV, and networks rarely saved ""deleted"" scenes.

Thanks go to S'more for making this film available again.

2056192,5,B00022EEDK,This is such a terrific movie.  I personally think that it is Elizabeth Taylor's best  movie.  And she and Jane Alexander had such a wonderful chemistry together.  I checked Amazon to see if I could get it for my mother; she taped it when it was on TV but the tape is getting old.  I was shocked to see that a used copy is going for $79.00!  And a new one is advertised for $120.00!  I think it is time that this movie was re-released on DVD because there must be a demand for it for sellers to be asking such astronomical prices.,1296000000,,530,4.087378640776699
2056193,5,B00022EEDK,"I think this is one of the best movies to show just how two women, Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, controlled Hollywood back in its heyday.  Elizabeth Taylor does a great job of portraying Louella Parsons, right down to her quirky way of speaking.  Jane Alexander does a fabulous job with her rendition of Hedda Hopper.  All in all, if you can get a hold of this movie on DVD, snatch it up....it's worth the money!",1280707200,,416,4.447368421052632
8020493,3,B00022EEDK,"a little bit of fun, but hollywoodized for the pure of mind..........if you want to know about these ...ladies... read about how selfish and inhuman and powerful they were.",1487635200,,172,4.9655172413793105
8020494,5,B00022EEDK,"Malice In Wonderland was released in 1985. It starred Elizabeth Taylor in this great television film about the rivalry between Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper. Two feuding gloriously bitchy Hollywood Gossip Columnists  in the 1940's through the 1960's. Elizabeth lived through it in real life, so she delivers her barbs with much vitriol. Fans of Elizabeth Taylor will like this the most.",1480118400,,389,5.274193548387097
8020495,5,B00022EEDK,"AWESOME, THANKS !!",1476144000,,18,5.333333333333333

8020497,4,B00022EEDK,"Elizabeth Taylor's less known movies are very difficult to find in my country. It was a very good acquision. A It's just a pity a movie like that doesn't have any subtitles, even in English, that facilitate for other country people unverstand even more.",1431820800,,253,4.7727272727272725
8020498,5,B00022EEDK,Very good to watch it again!,1430697600,,28,3.8333333333333335
8020499,5,B00022EEDK,"Based on George Eels dual biography HEDDA & LOUELLA, this lavish network TV movie is good, dishy fun. Elizabeth Taylor offers a hilarious take on the infamous Louella Parsons (who she dealt with back in the day) and Jane Alexander is sensational as the more glamorous but equally ruthless Hedda Hopper. I loved this when it was first broadcast, and found that it lived up to my original opinion. I did not recall young Tim Robbins as Joseph Cotten, an actor who had the nerve to give one of these gossip queens a swift but celebrated kick in the rear. Great fun for anyone who loves old Hollywood or a chance to see two great actresses having a field day.",1417996800,,655,4.466666666666667
8020500,5,B00022EEDK,Manu tanks it's a very good performance. I l'ile very much lisabeth Taylor and she plays very well it's a real pleasure.,1397174400,,120,4.5
8020501,4,B00022EEDK,jane alexander and liz taylor were hoots as the infamous hedda hopper and louella parsons. its a real cat fight kind of a movie,1391212800,,127,4.333333333333333
