It made me feel great to see a lot of my favorite artist of the 50's.plus you got to see what styles the english teens had in the 50's which was interesting.the bad part is,if you saw the 80's release on video tape this started off with lord sutch singing Alice cooper which was great even though i am not a l970's fan and there was minor nudity among fans at the concert which was cut os i much prefer the 8o's uncut version.i hate anything thats cut and thus the 3 stars instead of 5 for the original version",1519430400,,763,4.059602649006623
