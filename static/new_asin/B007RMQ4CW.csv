5109102,3,B007RMQ4CW,"I never understood why the producers of DW felt the necessity to replace two iconic characters - Charlene and Suzanne - all at once.  True, Delta Burke and Jean Smart were the comic drivers of many of the absurd situations, but the existing cast was strong enough to let Dixie Carter and Annie Potts lead the show for a year while exploring new directions, allowing the characters created by Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostly to assume larger roles. Season 7 was set during a recession, and it would have been perfectly reasonable in the story line to have a decline in business force the Sugarbaker design firm to ask Ghostly's character, Bernice, to become a befuddled part time receptionist answering phones and causing chaos.  Taylor always seemed to need a bigger role in the show, and guest stars could have assumed the roles of difficult clients to propel the story.  Guest stints by great character actresses such as Pat Carroll seen in this final season provide the perfect example of a new story direction.  No offense to Julia Duffy, but her shrewish,unlikeable character from Newhart was a huge mistake by the producers.  Duffy's character lacked the self-obsessed charm and endearing qualities of Suzanne, who always bore a distant resemblance to some of the young ladies who were at Auburn University when I was there.  It was sad to see a grand show take such an absolute 180 degree turn from its comic origins, and season five is the point where the show should have ended rather than die its slow two-season death.",1337644800,6,1530,4.820610687022901
5109103,4,B007RMQ4CW,"Amazing episodes as always because, DUH, it's Designing Women. I loved the addition of BJ, as well as Anthony's new wife. BJ is a client that sticks around and is hilarious, rich, and (Texan?). Then, Carlene is still on. With these three characters they contribute to the comedy of the amazing and masterful acting of the beloved Dixie Carter and Annie Potts.

I'd like to address some of the other reviewers' comments. Yes, it is true that Delta Burke and Jean Smart are gone. And yes, they were fantastic and part of the dynamic quartet that drove the show. However, this show, even without them, is still much better than 95 percent of other shows out there.

5109104,2,B007RMQ4CW,"""Designing Women"" thrived due to the chemistry between four amazing actresses:  Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, Annie Potts, and Jean Smart.  As far as I'm concerned, the show ended at the end of season 5.  I give this season two stars simply because Dixie, Annie and Alice (Bernice) appear.  Aside from their performances, well, it's just a hot mess.  Love you, Delta & Jean! :)",1335571200,4,374,4.78125
5109105,4,B007RMQ4CW,"This July, one of the most beloved, well-crafted, character-driven sitcoms will finally be complete on DVD thanks to Shout Factory, when Season 7 of ""Designing Women"" is released.

In 1992 ""Designing Women"" was coming off its highest ratings in the series' history following the replacement of half the cast, including the show's big breakout character. A remarkable achievement in lieu of the fact that one of the replacements was very poorly received by audiences. The producers decided to let Julia Duffy go because they felt the show was tarnished by such an unlikeable character. In the years since, it seems unanimous that it was the writing and NOT Duffy's performance that caused the backlash.

For Season 7, veteran stage/character actress Judith Ivey was brought in as the now-revolving fourth member of Sugarbakers (rumour has it after Bonnie Hunt turned down the part). As extremely-rich-but-down-to-earth widow B.J. Poteet, Ivey is a terrific addition to the seasoned cast, creating a colorful, charismatic character with a fleshed-out backstory but the addition of B.J. unfortunately throws the show off-kilter and it's now unbalanced like a table with only three legs. It's sad to see a series that has carefully developed it's characters for six years suddenly toss all their history aside to get some cheap laughs. With new writers and Norma Safford Vela now producing, that's exactly the problem with this final season. The show becomes a frustrating mass of contradictions that alienated all except the most devoted fans. The new Friday night timeslot no doubt cost ""Designing Women"" a large chunk of their audience too (the show plunged from #6 to #67 in the Nielsen's resulting in CBS cancelling it in Spring 1993).

We open the season with Sugarbakers in dire financial straits because Allison (Julia Duffy) pulled her money out in the middle of a recession. A chance meeting has B.J. Poteet (Judith Ivey) winning the business from Julia (Dixie Carter) in a card game which sets up the premise for this third (and final) incarnation of the show. With B.J. now aboard as the direct and sensible one, Julia has devolved from the dignified, authoritative and savvy leader to an insufferably superior, petulant shrew, though the writers at least try and attribute the change in behavior to menopause. Carter is obviously relishing the chance for the character to show some wild abandon, but the change leaves long-time viewers bewildered. Mary Jo (Annie Potts) also gets more cartoonish and over-the-top, but ironically Carlene (Jan Hooks) gets toned down somewhat. Delivery and timing of all the ladies is still razor-sharp and Ivey's transition into the group is flawless; it's the scripts that let them down.

Anthony's engagement to Vanessa Chamberlain (Jackee Harry) is now history--too bad because she could have perfectly filled the void left by Burke/Duffy--so Sheryl Lee Ralph joins the cast during a November Sweeps two-parter in Las Vegas that has Anthony marrying her character (showgirl Etienne Toussant) in a drunken quickie ceremony we the audience never see. The addition of Ralph is another nail in the coffin because she's a very poor substitute for the show's ""diva"" slot. Etienne's personality changes from sharp-cookie to airhead depending on the needs of the script and she seems a better fit for any show on the WB network--not one of CBS's most prestigious comedies.

So to sum it up--yes, Season 7 is a mess, but it is not without a few good points. Alice Ghostley is on board for more than half the episodes and our ""little fruitcake"" Bernice is as flaky as ever. Next, the hair, makeup and wardrobe this season is absolutely gorgeous. With B.J.'s millions, it makes sense for Ivey to be dressed to the nines in designer chic every episode, but I guess the producers didn't want the others to look cheap in comparison, so even student/part time receptionist Carlene is decked out in expensive business suits. Carter looks younger here than she did in Season One and Potts' flaming mane was never as ORANGE as you'll see it here (she cut it all off when filming was over to begin her new stint on CBS' ""Love and War"" which had taken over DW's former Monday-night berth).

This is a most uneven season because while it has its share of clunkers, a few are actually some of my favorites of the entire series. ""The Woman Who Came to Sugarbakers"" features a great turn from bombastic guest star Pat Carroll as Julia's schoolmistress and some of Bernice's most hilarious lines ever. ""The Lying Game"" has Carlene turning the tables on her crossdressing boyfriend; ""Love Letters"" is a showcase for Ivey's years of theatre training; ""Sex, Lies and Bad Hair Days"" expertly draws on the show's basic premise of ""get four women together and listen to them talk"".

Like Seasons 5-6, the comedy is at the forefront but the quality of humour this final go-round has degenerated into that of cheap boob jokes. Those who loved the more thoughtful, sedate ambiance of Seasons 1 and 2 will likely be repulsed by this; fans of more crass comedies like ""Will and Grace"" or even ""Hot In Cleveland"" will enjoy it more.

And so Season 7 leaves fans in a quandary--we have a fabulous welcome addition with fun-lovin'-good-'ole-Texas-gal B.J. but her arrival throws the whole balance off and the show is left spinning its' wheels. It certainly deserved the same proper closure that ""The Golden Girls"" finale brought to their show. Script quality aside, it's fantastic to finally see one of my all-time favorites complete on DVD. Once again, the cover art is a little off to diehard fans as Carter's image is actually from a Season Five photo session but it's no biggie, just sayin'! Thanks AGAIN, Shout Factory, for yet another rescue mission!",1333670400,30,5761,4.981288981288981

5109108,4,B007RMQ4CW,"I wasn't sure what to expect for this final season and I was right to be uneasy.  My biggest reaction was ""What is this and who are these women who look so familiar?""  Like the 6th season, Julia and Mary Jo have departed from their true personalities and the behavior that they had for 5 seasons and become someone else.  Carlene continued to morph into a completely different person, too, but it wasn't as noticeable since we only met her in Season 6.  Bernice became a little less belligerent, but remained as sex-obsessed as she was in Season 6.  Apparently the new writers have heard the old adage that ""Sex sells"" and were working it for all they could.  I liked B.J. for the most part, though I found two of her habits annoying.  The first one, constantly talking about how much money she has and how she can buy herself and all her friends anything they want, became tiresome very quickly.  I wanted to say, ""Okay, it's established that you are filthy rich.  Now can we move on?""  And the way she was always throwing out analogies became old quickly, too.  They were funny; some of them REALLY funny, but not all day every day.  The story lines themselves are amusing and most of them are the sort of thing that the women of Sugarbaker's (and the long-suffering Anthony) often got involved in, but the way they approach it is usually quite different.  In the end, I was amused but a little bewildered.",1477267200,,1408,4.496062992125984

5109129,3,B007RMQ4CW,"As I said in the headliner, I got Season 7 of Designing Women only to have all seasons of this classic series. As we all know, Season 6 dealt with the exit of Delta Burke and Jean Smart and introduced Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks as their replacements. Many viewers did not relate to Duffy's snobby portrayal of Allison Sugarbaker, but many found Hooks as the dimwitted Carlene Dobber to be hysterical. Season 7 gives us yet another cast change as Julia Duffy was let go from her contract and Judith Ivey steps in as her replacement, the wealthy Texan Bonnie Jean ""B.J."" Poteet.

The season opener, ""Of Human Bondage"", is basically a standard episode. Allison Sugarbaker has bailed on Sugarbaker & Associates and the remaining three women, Julia (Dixie Carter), Mary Jo (Annie Potts), and Carlene (Jan Hooks) realize that their business could go bankrupt. They attend a party held by their newest client, the wealthy widow B.J. Poteet (Judith Ivey in her first episode), where they get drunk and play poker with her. Julia looses Sugarbaker's in a bet with B.J., who decides to give it back. In the end, the four women become close friends and B.J. decides to invest her millions into the business to keep it afloat. In all, this is a fare episode, but considerably weak when compared to the Season 6 premiere.

Season 7 overall seems to be unfocused. Stories are all over the place. Anthony and Vanessa (Olivia Brown and Jacke) decided to not get marry and Vanessa is never mentioned nor seen on the series again. In the episode ""Viva Las Vegas"" (Season 7, Episode 6), the women talk Anthony into going on a trip to Las Vegas to cheer him up. While there, he wakes up one morning to find himself married to showgirl Etienne Toussaint (Sheryl Lee Ralph). He considers getting the marriage annulled, but ends up finding he and Etienne love each other.

In all honesty, Season 6 was indeed far better than Season 7. As much as Julia Duffy as so-called ""hated"" by viewers, Season 6 had fresh episodes and I found myself laughing uncontrollably. Season 7 offers only minor chuckles at best. The addition of Judith Ivey was perhaps not a wise decision. I am not personally a huge fan of Ms. Ivey or her character B.J. She seems to me to be a stereotypical caricature of the way Hollywood views people from the South. Season 7 is terribly weak: Julia and Mary Jo become more outlandish in their characteristics, while Carlene becomes somewhat more intelligent this season, especially when she uses her ex-husband only for sex.

Many long-running fans see Season 7 as an improvement over Season 6, but I must disagree with the majority. Season 7 is the worst season of Designing Women without a question. The series finale, ""Gone with a Whim"", is terribly cliched and badly performed; it is noticeable that the cast was weary with the show and wanted to move on. Do not get me wrong, this season is still far better than anything on TV now, but its a low-point in the Designing Women franchise. Its probably a good thing Season 7 was the last season.

5109130,5,B007RMQ4CW,"It finishes off a teriffic show! We love these women! This is one of
our very favorite sitcoms that was ever on TV!!!",1402444800,,117,4.130434782608695
5109131,3,B007RMQ4CW,"Let me start off by saying that this is, in my opinion, the worst season of Designing Women. Although season six gets most of the bad rap for the dislike of Julia Duffy's portrayal, I honestly believe this seventh (and final) go around is the weakest link among the show's run. When season six got almost a universally negative response from critics and the show's loyal fans, the producers thought they could get rid of Julia Duffy, who was not popular with the majority. They thought that getting rid of Duffy as the problem, they could save the day and go on for perhaps another few years. Sadly, this wasn't the case.

In the season-opener, ""Of Human Bondage"", we learn that Allison Sugarbaker (Duffy) has withdrew her money from Sugarbaker's to invest it in a Victoria's Secret fashion line, and that the design firm is in serious financial trouble (reflecting the recession of the early 1990s). Julia (Dixie Carter), Mary Jo (Annie Potts), Carlene (Jan Hooks), and Anthony (Meshach Taylor) go to meet their newest client, the wealthy Texas widow, Bonnie Jean ""B.J."" Poteet (Judith Ivey). B.J. hires the ladies to redecorate her house, and over the course of the evening (through a series of unusual events), she becomes a partner to the ladies and the firm's primary financial backer.

When I first watched this final season of Designing Women, I didn't like it at all, and I was not impressed (by any means) by Judith Ivey's performance as B.J. Poteet. Having re-watched a majority of the episodes over since then, I have come to realize that it isn't Miss Ivey I don't like, it's the unfocused and weak writing that made me not like it at first. The topicality of the earlier seasons is almost completely gone, if not entirely, having been replaced by more naughty humor. Judith Ivey does the best with what she is given, and in all reality, her character is given more in-depth characterization that Julia Duffy's character unfortunately didn't get in season six. Miss Ivey brings a sassy sarcasm to the show, which is most prominently used when she butts heads with Dixie Carter's Julia. However, her sense of humor and personality is also another reason this season changed, and not necessarily for the better.

Although Judith Ivey brought some much needed sass to the show as B.J. Poteet (as I've said), her basic strong personality had already been with the show, in the form of Julia Sugarbaker, and to a lesser extant, in Mary Jo Shively. In order to keep the balance of four women right, Mary Jo and Julia change. Mary Jo has shredded all the maturity she has showed us in the past seasons. Not once in season seven do we see the dignified yet witty Mary Jo we came to love; her entire behavior is extreme, right down to her lazy body language to her disregard to responsibility. She also has become quicker to butt heads with Julia, which she does on multiple occasions this year. Julia, as well, gets sillier this go around, mostly through a series of out-of-character instincts; in the premiere, she gets terribly drunk and sings karaoke, and she even shows interest in closing Sugarbaker's! The writers try to write off Julia's transformation by saying she's going through ""the change"" (menopause).

Jan Hooks, who came in last season as Charlene's naive younger sister Carlene Dobber, is toned down considerably this season, and thankfully so. Last season it made sense that she was dingy and naive because she was new to the ""big city"" of Atlanta, but had that continued this seventh season, it would've gotten old. Carlene is primarily used as a supporting character this year, but we do get two noteworthy episodes that do some good in-depth character development: in ""Sex and the Single Woman"", she starts up a relationship with her ex-husband, using him strictly for sex, and later, in ""The Lying Game"", she dates a man who enjoys cross-dressing, and she too takes a liking to the lifestyle (dressing like a man).

A main story this season deals with Anthony marrying Las Vegas showgirl Etienne Toussant. While on a trip to Las Vegas with Sugarbaker & Co., Anthony gets drunk and wakes to find out he was married the night before. At first, he and Etienne aren't sure they want to stay married, but later they decide to make the best of it, and remained married for the remainder of the series.

A treat for many long-running fans of Designing Women is the inclusion of Alice Ghostley as Bernice, our ""little fruitcake"". This season, she's in fourteen of the twenty-two episodes, more than any she's been in seasons past. However, we don't get any further insights to her character in these episodes, she's primarily here for her shock value and to perhaps keep the audience with the show. In all honesty, the majority of the episodes Bernice is included in this season are pretty weak, and only added to the overall horrible silliness and vulgarity.

In conclusion, season seven of Designing Women is a complete mess. The performances are substandard, particularly those of Dixie Carter and Annie Potts, who seem to have gone out of their minds, but this blame cannot be put entirely on these two actresses, but on the new writers the show got this season that had absolutely no idea what they were doing (or so it seems). Perhaps the best performers this season are rookie Judith Ivey and Jan Hooks, who offer a sense of subtlety among all the commotion and downright stupid-ness everyone else seems to bring this year. In all honesty, I hated given a review as negative as this for a show I have loved for quite some time. I'm not saying everyone will think like (in disliking this season) because from what I've read, some reviewers like the later seasons better. This is just not my personal taste, and more importantly, this is not Designing Women. It killed me to give this set three stars, but I had to be honest. Get it to complete the series, but don't be shocked when things aren't want you hoped they would be.",1401062400,,5949,4.742028985507246

Even if not the best season, it's still fun and enjoyable TV.  I was afraid they wouldn't finish releasing the series, as they've done with other classic TV shows (still waiting on the last 2 seasons of the Bob Newhart Show, for example).

5109135,3,B007RMQ4CW,"That's not a question that first pops into one's mind when taking the final season solely by itself. But certainly, when compared with the earliest episodes of season one, Designing Women has, by the series finale, jumped off the tracks and ran amok. There are some bright spots to be had! I still maintain that Jan Hooks was an absolute coup for the last couple of seasons of Designing Women. When she's good, she's great and she really has a knack for stealing the spotlight in her scenes. Her characterizations of iconic Gone With the Wind characters in the series finale, for example, is a riot! Alice Ghostley, with the show since the very beginning, takes the time among the inane plots and cartoon-ish situations of season seven to simply do her thing and it's such fun to watch. I would call Bernice, played by Ghostley, the steam behind the final season, the last original element that still maintains the enjoyable quality viewers fell in love with. The saddest thing about these last episodes is the characters of Mary Jo Shively and Julia Sugarbaker. Gone is the spot-on writing, crisp dialogue and effortless humor of yesteryear. The last of the original lead characters have been replaced with shrill caricatures of their original selves. Julia's Terminator alter ego is cranked up to the highest degree and, instead of cheering her on, I now find myself tuning her out. The same with Mary Jo, whose neuroses has risen so much, she spends a majority of season seven running around the set and screaming. Judith Ivey as BJ Poteet is largely forgettable and Meshach Taylor as Anthony is saddled with a season long subplot that is, quite frankly, subpar. The finale is tolerable and, as a send off into the great beyond of classic TV, is certainly fitting. However, it's an average goodbye and more time and heart could have been poured into the final hour. All in all, season seven is for completists and Jan Hooks fans only! Everyone else, move right along and revisit the original episodes. There's a reason Designing Women is classic comedy television!

5109144,5,B007RMQ4CW,"DVD itself came sealed and works as intended with no flaws in viewing. Price of course is always better (OK, almost always better) on Amazon!

The episodes of the final season are probably not regarded as the best in the series, but I truly love the later episodes. The introduction of the charachter BJ and the continuation of Carlene from the season prior are great additions to this season. The feeling of the shows is much more ""fun,"" than prior early seasons when the actors tend to be more business-like for lack of a better term. As they get more and more comfortable with each passing year their characters seems to take on more personality and become increasingly fun and relaxed on each episode, especially Julia and Mary Jo. Very stoic and business oriented, they become increasingly fun and down-to-earth as the series goes on.

I personally love the entire series from season 1 right to the end. This season might not fit everyone's idea of the best season, but I believe it's a showcase of the evolution the characters took on as the series progresses. I LOVE IT!",1360800000,8,1077,4.693121693121693

5109146,4,B007RMQ4CW,"To put it simply, ""Designing Women"" was one fabulous-southern-classy-funny-liberal-witty-informative-ballsy-show. I loved absolutely every minute of it! A show filled with too-many-to-name funny moments, as well as some really touching, heartwarming ones. To be completely honest, the final season was far from the magic of the previous seven seasons. As much as I love B.J. Poteet...I honestly loved Alison more. Julia Duffy as Alison was a great addition, but sadly, she was let go for whatever reason. It would have been fantastic if Alison would have been able to stick around and B.J. was brough in as another great recurring character along with Bernice Clifton (the loveable ""Queen of Nuttiness""). Sadly, it didn't work out that way...but overall...the final season did have its share of funny, touching, Designing Women-type moments. A solid season. Far from perfect, but solid, none the less.",1358726400,,901,5.442857142857143

5109152,5,B007RMQ4CW,"It's always good to get the complete series on DVD and this was no exception.  Adding Judith Ivy to the show was hilarious.  She's a very talented actress and added a lot to the show.

They were all good episodes.  But I enjoyed the first one where they met her and she became their partner and the very last one where they all were Scarlet and they had to save a southern plantation.

It is worth the purchase.",1351987200,,411,4.217948717948718
5109153,3,B007RMQ4CW,"Not having seen this since it originally aired 20 years ago(!), my memory of this season was, to put it mildly, a little hazy. The only episode I actually remembered was the Gone With The Wind spoof two-parter that served as the show's swan song. My other recollection was that I liked the addition of Judith Ivey and I thought overall that this was a better season than the previous one. So now it feels like I'm watching it again for the first time. And here's what I've deduced.
1) Season Six Was Better. As much as Julia Duffy's character (an extension of her Newhart role) was universally hated, overall I felt Season Six had better stories and better laughs. In contrast the first six episodes of Season Seven are dreadful, but if you make it through those, things definitely improve. And in retrospect, Duffy really wasn't that bad in Season Six, she was simply stuck with an unlikable Suzanne-filler that she couldn't do much with. The character of Carlene was much more successful. Which leads me to,
2) B.J. was a good move (in theory.) As I mentioned before, I thought bringing in Judith Ivey was great, in that she made B.J. a warm, believable character who brought some much needed sass to the show. The drawback was, like Alison, B.J. didn't really have much to besides butt heads with Julia, but she definitely was a better fit for the show.
3) Julia Becomes A Joke. What I mean by that is Julia Sugarbaker is no longer herself. What started out as the most level-headed character devolved into a parody. Julia Sugarbaker joining in an impromptu Motown routine in a hospital room? I don't think so! Even Dixie Carter seemed to poke fun at herself, and that was disappointing. This character decline started around the sixth season, but this season is the most obvious.
So, in conclusion, it's probably a good thing that this was the final season, though a proper send off would have been nice. In all, this was certainly a watchable season, but the bloom had worn off for this series, making one feel nostalgic for the earlier seasons and cast members.",1349136000,12,2067,4.6502732240437155
5109154,1,B007RMQ4CW,"I LOVED this show.  Let me say that first.  I LOVE Dixie and Delta and Annie and Jean and of course Alice Ghostly, absolutely LOVE them, they worked VERY well together in the first 5 seasons of course.  HOWEVER, much like season 6, this last season was VERRRRRRY hard to watch and VERRRRRRY hard to find any good belly laughs.  I've been a fan of Jan Hooks for years and enjoyed HER on this season, but the storylines and the writing were just horrid.  I couldn't even WATCH that last double-episode that mimicked Gone With The Wind.  That was just unbearable.  I would say of the 22 episodes of this final season, maybe 3 are halfway memorable.  In season 6, Jackee Harry was awful in the role of Vanessa and she kept using the black/white race line, which was a huge turn off.  The original Vanessa from the earlier seasons was much more interesting AND funny.  But in this final season, the whole Anthony/Ettienne story line was a bust from the get-go.  I think her character (not Sheryl Lee Ralph), but her character, was utterly unbeleivable and unfunny and she just didn't fit in the ensemble.  It was bad enough that Anthony, as the show wore on, became snootier and snootier but to match him up with that dreadful Ettienne also made any episodes she was in unbearable to watch and hugely unfunny.  Even cringe-inducing.  Berniece was THEE only reliably funny character on this season.  I liked BJ's no-nonsense attitude as well but it wasn't enough, in my humble opinion, to generate real laughs.  I knew this season wasn't up to par with the earlier seasons but I wanted to complete my DW collection.  I often play the other seasons as background company when I'm puttering around the house or cooking or whatever, but the discs of seasons 6 & 7 will never see the light of day again.  Such a shame this show declined the way it did.  I'm going back to the Suzanne episodes!",1345420800,4,1883,4.550595238095238
5109155,4,B007RMQ4CW,"I didn't watch the last season of Designing Women when it first aired. I was preparing for comps and TV wasn't high on my list of priorities. I also remember that it got poor reviews. But watching it now on DVD I'm not at all sure why it has such a bad reputation. The writing and acting are head and shoulders above anything available on a sitcom now. Judith Ivey and Sheryl Lee Ralph are delightful. I suspect that if the show had started out with this cast and this tone it might have been highly successful.

Because there is a decided shift in tone this season, and audiences might have found that disorienting. The characters have become caricatures, albeit likeable ones. Julia's sermonizing and Mary Jo's rabid feminism are sources of amusement rather than edification. The warm, three dimensional characters of the first few seasons all have much sharper edges now, and at times the comedy seems to tilt in the direction of the surreal.

Part of the problem I suspect is that Designing Women represented one of the last gasps of the Norman Lear school of the sitcom as a platform for liberal audience indoctrination, and the dubious charms of that particular school were rapidly wearing thin. The show always offered unintentional evidence of the impasse facing liberals during the Reagan/Bush years. Julia is an aristocratic populist who LOVES the people in the abstract, but can barely conceal her contempt for voters who insist on electing Republicans. She was forever offering homilies that were supposed to represent the last word on the subjects at hand, except that the opposing position was invariably caricatured and those who supported it depicted as fools and bigots. The shift in tone perhaps represented a belated recognition that audiences were tired of comedies that confused sofas with pews. And with hindsight the treatment of Bill Clinton's election as a form of second coming seems more than a little premature. (How do you feel about welfare reform, Julia?)

Nevertheless, this last season of Designing Women works for me because it succeeds where a sitcom is supposed to succeed. It makes me laugh. I'm only sad we didn't get a chance to see more of Judith Ivey's delicious and down to earth Texas millionaire. I would love to have seen more of her.
