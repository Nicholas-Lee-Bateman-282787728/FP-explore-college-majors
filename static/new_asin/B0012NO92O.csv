3092686,2,B0012NO92O,"I have been waiting for a good Tristan on DVD forever...Unfortunately I didn't get it with this one...I don't understand why someone won't just create a production that is TRADITIONAL as Wagner wanted it?  Instead all we've gotten so far are modern abstract concoctions trying to blend the new with the new...

For this production we get some very weird stuff that highlights the ""psychology"" of the drama...it works sometimes but mostly it makes you think too much, and for Tristan, you want to be taken away all the time...you don't want to think!

I mean the staging works at conveying hidden intentions in the story and characters, but I was left with a feeling of wanting to see more camera movement different scenery almost all the time.

The singing is a bit hard to interpret...they hit all the notes perfectly, but they are almost cold in their delivery...like someone told them not to express any feeling!  Their body movements are minimal and whenever they do move they do it so slowely!  The only thing I liked about ths production was Baremboim's conducting...I say that it is inspired!  But overall I wouldn't invest in this production unless you don't mind all the things I talked about.

3092687,5,B0012NO92O,"Tristan and Isolde is one of the most emblematic Operas ever made along the history of the Western music, because among other facts, carves in relief the impossibility to achieve the love as supreme bliss for a long time.

Tristan is the epitome of the noble, valorous, bold and courageous hero who suddenly finds himself  literally trapped between his duty and his bliss, between the loyalty and his most intimate desires.

But also, there` s not other Opera that reveals with chilling reality these inner contradictions immersed into the human soul and those unexplored labyrinths of the human physique.

This version reflects and captures with magisterial precision this complex universe of never felt before feelings, the supreme bliss of love against the legal duty that should be kept before a superior authority.

The mesmerizing, original and fabulous stage illustrates and conveys us about this state of existential anguish and febrile desperation about these two lovers. The extraordinary participation of both principal figures - Waltrud Meier and Sigfried Jerusalem plus the enraptured spell of the Orchestra superbly conducted by Daniel Barenboim have become this recording a must have and one of the most treasured musical documents ever recorded.

Don't even doubt or hesitate about if you have to acquire or not this essential DVD. On the contrary, ask yourself if you can live without having it.",1222646400,8,1412,5.253333333333333
3092688,5,B0012NO92O,"In July, 2007, I started my review of the Barenboim/Ponnelle Tristan und Isolde with the following: ""Tristan Und Isolde is doubtless one of the greatest operas ever written. Unfortunately it has been very badly served by the currently available productions on DVD.""  I then listed the previous ill-conceived and/or incompetent productions before writing about that production to which I gave 5 stars (and which still remains my favourite).

I then gave 5 stars to the Belohlavek/Lehnhoff Tristan which came out in March and thought that there was an embarasse de richesse.  Now, we have yet another excellent (and different) production which, for my taste, has now taken second place.

As with the Barenboim/Ponnelle production (as well as others from Bayreuth), this was recorded on stage, but without an audience.  As a result, everything is as intended, very clear and with the performers not fatigued.  Some might worry about a possible lack of immediacy, but that is not a problem here.

Barenboim's conducting (and the orchestra) seems better than in his previous DVD.  The power and the passion of the score is very much in evidence.  The acting and singing of Waltraud Meier and Siegfried Jerusalem (both singing these roles for the first time) are superb and, in my opinion, unsurpassed on DVD, although Johanna Meier certainly is just about as good.

According to the liner notes, the direction was offered to Chereau, but he declined stating: ""Tristan cannot be staged, it is a radio play"".  It was then offered to Heiner Muller.  And what came out was, in many respects, very static in action.  The set is minimal (a sunken area stage front for Isolde and Brangane with a raised area in back for Tristan and Kurwenal in Act I, rows of breastplates for Act II, and an armchair on ragged crushed stone in Act III.  But the colours set the mood and enhance the action (such as it is) with many abstract Rathko-like rectangles for the preludes in the colours of the acts: red, orange and yellow in Act I, dark shades of blue for Act II, and washed out sand-grey for Act III until the Liebestod when Isolde is in silver/gold before a warm coloured backdrop.

But despite the absence of much vigorous action, the body language of the performers makes everything very clear.  I was at first puzzled at the lack of physical contact between Tristan and Isolde, particularly during the very erotic/romantic music of Act II.  But that surely is what Wagner wrote the opera about -- yearning, frustrating, unconsummated love which can only find fulfillment in death.  Tristan, self absorbed, led up to the idea of death while Isolde, Wagner's woman, tried to make contact but had to follow Tristan's lead.  Their continual coming close and then separating, hardly touching, added considerably to the tension to the point where I wanted to call out to them to get on with it. The only time there seemed to be any mutual tenderness was finally when Isolde agreed to follow Tristan, just before he allowed himself to be stabbed.  Quite disturbing, but a successful execution of a director's concept.

However, when a director uses symbols there can be misinterpretation, particularly for a cross-cultural viewer.  He can do what David Alden did in his somewhat bizarre ""Tannhauser"" and throw in scores hoping that some will be able to be interpreted.  But Muller in this spare production has very few.  I can understand (I think) the shoulder yokes on (and off) the characters -- but if anyone can come up with a plausible interpretation of he rows of breastplates in Act II, I would be grateful for an explanation.
My only other (personal) reservation is that I have never liked the voice of Falk Struckmann.  He is younger here (as Kurwenal) than in the other DVD's which I have seen; but he still sounds harsh, cold and dry.

All told, one of the best productions of this great opera.  Highly recommended.",1219708800,27,3905,4.859516616314199
3092689,5,B0012NO92O,"This is a truly great performance of this opera.  The singing is superb, especially that of Waltrud Meier, whose facial expressiveness is well caught on this video production.  The orchestral playing wonderful and Barenboim's interpretation captures the emotional depth of the music.  Highly recommended as a performance.

This issue is offered in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1.  The seemingly total lack of audience noise suggests it was recorded (like the Ponnelle version) without an audience present. The DTS version presents a broader soundstage with more bass, but it takes a while to get used to the reverberant sound of the voices.  The PCM version sounds more natural in that respect.  There was some inconsistancy in the recorded sound, sometimes sounding closely miked, at other times more distant.  But this was not a serious problem.

The video reproduction is in widescreen format.  The picture is flawless with no detectable video artifacts and presented in gorgeously reproduced color.

The sets and stage direction for this production are somewhat problematic for me.  The booklet notes led me to expect a much more austere production than is actually presented.  The Rothko like color sets enhance the music nicely, especially in the first and last acts, and wonderfully in the golden/red glow of the final Liebestod.  The set and staging for the second act was, however, a disappointment for me.  My first response to the rows of armor was to be reminded of the rows of alien pods in the crashed spaceship from the first Alien movie, an image I haven't been able to erase from my mind.  Isolde begins the act holding a pair of shoes in her hand, an image I found distracting and meaningless.  The physical interaction between the two singers did not seem as ""carefully restricted"" as the booklet notes suggested it would be, but I felt that it lacked the intimacy that the music portrays. Wagner's stage directions (in this production ignored) indicating that Tristan should stretch out his cloak to hide Isolde when the lovers are discovered suggest a lot more was going on between the two (wonderfully captured by the music) than can be expected to be shown on a live stage.  If you want to see the ""real"" thing, watch the Tristan sequence in the movie Excalibur.

I would say that the musical interpretation of Levine is somewhat deeper (when I turn off the video) and that the sets of Ponnelle are more to my liking (except for the revisionist ending), but this is the better video all around.",1219449600,15,2514,4.900709219858156
3092690,5,B0012NO92O,"Wagner's operas are well represented on DVD. There are three excellent Rings, several superb Meistersingers, Parsifals in all flavours, Lohengrins by the ton, and a couple of good Hollanders.  Up until now there has only been one Tristan worth watching - the 1983 Bayreuth production conducted by Barenboim and directed by Ponnelle.

I believe that this 1993 Bayreuth production, also conducted by Barenboim, surpasses the earlier recording.

Why? Let's start with the principals.

Meyer and Jerusalem have great stage presence, wonderful voices and, unlike some others I've seen in these roles, are very capable actors. Waltraut Meyer is at her peak - quite frankly, I've never heard her sing as well as she does in this production (and she normally sings very well indeed). Jerusalem sails through the difficult third act, exercising his vocal and acting skills to the full.
Barenboim matches the orchestra to the singers with amazing precision - not once did the opera overpower the voices, and not once was there a sense of holding back to let inadequate voices have their chance. This is particularly tricky in Liebestod, where the orchestra has a lot to say, but mustn't drown Isolde. The combination of Meyer, Barenboim, and of course, Bayreuth produced the most perfect Liebestod I've ever heard.

The supporting roles were well played. Konig Marke was sympathetically portrayed by Mattias Holle. Kurvenal and Brangane were excellent.

I suppose I should mention the slightly Eurodaft staging. Some odd decisions here, although they couldn't detract from the gesamtkunstwerk.
-  The strange plexiglass harnesses worn throughout act 1 (which I imagine symbolized inhibition, since they fell off after the love draught)
-  The vaguely Chinese costume and scenery (borrowed, I think, by the designer of the Met's current, lacklustre staging)
-  The brief flash of red light when Tristan and Isolda succumb to the love draught (another idea borrowed by the Met)
However, unlike the Met, this was not a static, formalized, passionless performance. Tristan can be the most glacially slow of Wagner's operas if played without conviction, but this production conveyed the opera's essential passion.

This is apparently the first release of this performance in any format. It's quite amazing how a gem like this can lie hidden for fifteen years.

Technicalities; wide screen picture, synthesised DTS 5.1 sound; both superb.

Strongly recommended. Almost as good as a trip to Bayreuth.",1216684800,65,2483,5.290076335877862
3092691,5,B0012NO92O,"I can't resist the chance to write the first review of this DVD, even though it has not yet been released, and the only version I have seen is a disc in somewhat soft focus and with no subtitles (but an unbeatable price) from Premiere Opera.  That said, I will go out on a limb and proclaim this as my favorite ""Tristan"" DVD.

It's true that this Heiner Muller production faces very strong competition from both the Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and Nikolaus Lehnhoff versions--all three are visually and conceptually striking (Peter Konwitschny's production, probably the most daring of all, has some brilliant moments but is saddled with too many inexplicable, maddening misfires to stand in the first rank).  If Amazon someday releases last year's televised La Scala performance directed by Patrice Chereau, which (like the Muller and Ponnelle) features Barenboim conducting and (like the Muller and Konwitschny) offers Waltraud Meier as Isolde, it will most likely join the above big three in the upper echelon.

Like Ponnelle and Lehnhoff, Muller creates an arrestingly beautiful production, though more austere than the other two. The German playwright allegedly tried to take a colder, more clinical view of Wagner's great paean to unfulfilled passion, but his Bayreuth ""Tristan"" manages to be all the more affecting because of its sober restraint (a restraint very much in keeping, after all, with Wagner's lovers, who spend an entire stolen night of love doing nothing but philosophizing). The production is abstract but visually enticing, featuring a recurring motif of vibrant, luminous squares reminiscent of Rothko's paintings (during the preludes to each of the three acts, the camera slowly pans across a number of thematically related abstract paintings--a far more satisfying visual complement to the music than is found in either the Ponelle or Lehnhoff videos).

Muller is helped immeasurably by his two leads, both assuming their respective roles for the first time.  The young Waltraud Meier is an even better actress (and even more beautiful) than the formidable Nina Stemme in the Lehnhoff production (and preferable on both counts to Johanna Meier in the Ponnelle). Some have objected on principle to a mezzo singing Isolde, but I find Meier up to the role's vocal demands, particularly at this relatively early point in her career.  And while she apparently didn't enjoy working under Muller's direction, her mesmerizing performance is nonetheless the soul of this production.  Siegfried Jerusalem, his hair effectively pulled back in a tight ponytail, seems to me vocally and visually preferable to both Rene Kollo for Ponnelle and John Gambill for Lehnhoff, though he is less varied than either as an actor, particularly in the great test of the wounded knight's Act III delirium.

To touch upon some of the production's more distinctive features . . . Act I takes place in a stark, simple boxlike set in browns and golds, with Isolde's chamber appearing as no more than a recessed section at the front of the raked stage.  All the characters wear severe black cassocks, along with odd but strangely arresting clear plastic yokes which signify their enthrallment to the mundane world of obligations and social ties (the lovers remove theirs upon drinking the love potion).  The great second act love duet takes place, not in a garden, but amidst rows of armored breastplates, suggesting an armory or a graveyard, and perhaps indicating the soulless uniformity against which the lovers try to carve out their fragile union.  The lovers are still in black, but now wear more flowing robes with blue accents that effectively match the colored streaks in their hair.  In keeping with Muller's cooler view, the rapturous meeting of the lovers is studiously underplayed and they remain reticent about making actual contact, but nonetheless at key moments the camera closes in on striking, still tableaus of them sitting back to back or in each other's arms.  The bleak final act is set in a large yet claustrophic box strewn with rubble, the characters dressed in dirty, ragged coats.  It's Wagner by way of Samuel Beckett's ""Endgame,"" a notion brilliantly crystallized in the presence of a blind watchman, evoking the utter futility of Tristan's longing for Isolde.  Towards the end of the opera, Muller shows his disdain for Wagner's rather hasty fight sequences by rendering them in what has to be the most perfunctory stage combat ever seen.  But Meier's final liebestod, rapturously sung as she stands in a luminous golden gown against a glowing gold square, ends the performance on an image of sublime, ethereal beauty reminiscent of early Italian Renaissance religious iconography.

Having gone on at such length already, I'll conclude this discussion, sit back, and wait to see if other reviewers share my enthusiasm for this wonderful production.",1215388800,72,4867,5.1704834605597965

3092693,1,B0012NO92O,"The singing is ok but Waltraud Meier has no business singing Isolde. She is a good Kundry, but Isolde requires a larger voice than she possesses. The staging is ridiculous. The Liebestod is sung in a living room where the furniture is covered in slipcovers, which is a good thing, because the ceiling has fallen in and there is plaster all over the floor. The staging is just ugly and relentlessly artsy. I much prefer the simple yet beautiful staging of the Metropolitan Opera version.",1381190400,11,486,4.729411764705882

3092697,4,B0012NO92O,"we bought this dvd due to rave reviews in all categories: stage, music and rendition. The music was riveting, Siegfried Jerusalem came through in the last act, and  Meier stole the show. However, we were not entirely impressed with Muller's staging; while there were interesting elements of modernistic symbolism, the sets were static, and not enough to hold visual attention through the opera.",1313452800,5,394,5.253968253968254
3092698,4,B0012NO92O,"I bought this and the previous Bayreuth/Barenboim production DVD at the same time, so comparisons will be inevitable. This performance of Wagner's monumental ode to passion stands at the very top of the list.

Every conductor who plays this music well (and in Wagner we MUST consider the conducting first) brings to it a distinctive style. Furtwngler, a delicacy and lyricism; Karajan's is languid sensuality; Bhm's is white hot urgency. Barenboim finds a balance of lyricism and passion and a sense of dramatic detail much like Carlos Kleiber's, which is here recorded better and in clearer balance with the stage than in the 1983 Ponelle production. His tendency toward abrupt changes of tempo is a little less evident than in the earlier video.

The cast is consistently very good, if not consistently great. Uta Priew is a good Brangne, not quite in the class of Hanna Schwarz or Stephanie Blythe (no one is in the class of Christa Ludwig...well, maybe Brigitte Fassbnder). Falk Struckmann is a fine Kurwenal, and all of the smaller parts are more than adequate. Matthias Hlle's King Marke, however handsomely sung fails to convey much of the inner conflict, outward hurt, anger, and disappointment, and struggling compassion that can make his 12 minute monologue a real highlight of the 2nd act, not merely something to be 'got through.' Matti Salminen, in the Ponelle/Bayreuth production, does just that.

Which brings us to the title characters. While neither has the opulent tone of a Melchior or Vinay, Flagstad or Nilsson, neither do they fall far short as interpretive artists. When this production premiered two years earlier (1992), both Siegfried Jerusalem and Waltraud Meier were singing these roles for the first time.  After a couple of years, and some performances elsewhere, both were well settled into the parts, both vocally and dramatically. Meier, originally a mezzo, was utterly at her peak at this time. She is also a strikingly beautiful stage presence and an excellent actor. Her singing is secure and full of detail, and every word is clear and effective. Jerusalem is at the disadvantage of having begun his singing career late: a bassoonist until age 35, his technique is less well developed than a singer who started earlier. He is a splendid artist, though, and always conveys a profoundly poetic sense of the text with exquisite phrasing and musicality. He does appear to working harder at it than is ideal, but opera is not an artform designed for close-ups.

The production, by one of Germany's pre-eminent dramatists, is challenging and thought provoking, but not so much as to be at odds with either music or text.
It is most successful, and attractive, in the 1st and 3rd acts. The scenery, by Austrain designer Erik Wonder, is highly abstract, like paintings by Mark Rothko and Joseph Albers. Simple form and color define Act One's ship, with a small sunken rectangle for Isolde's claustrophobic cabin area. The chorus is never seen, and only the King's silhouette appears at the end of the act. Costumes are by Paris based Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto. Dark, severe robes give way to less restrained clothing when the lovers drink the potion. All wear clear plastic cage-like appliances around their shoulder, symbolic of inhibition or societal constraint. These come off with Tristan and Isolde's outer robes.

The Third Act is the most successful. I found it absolutely riveting. The stage is strewn with ash and rubble, and the few pieces of furniture draped in the same grey. A few simple shapes define an abstract space in Rothko fashion. Jerusalem is marvelously eloquent here, and Struckmann's Kurwenal is touching, and a blind shepherd gropes about the rubble field. Isolde's dark shift is transformed to shimmering gold for the Liebestod.

Which leaves us with the problematic Second Act. A dark blue and grey space for the castle garden is filled with row after row of armor breastplates, arranged like identical tombstones in a military cemetery. I have less of a problem with that image than how it is used. The lovers wander back and forth through this field during the extensive love music: rarely together, without physical or eye contact. The viewer is forced to grapple with this contradiction to the point that immersion in the all-engulfing tide of passionate music becomes difficult, if not impossible. In the theater one can simple close one's eyes, but at home too many distractions invite us to get up and do something else.

If your tastes run to more radical stagings you will probably like this production. I find it vastly superior to the MET's sterile and dehumanizing staging. Musically, there is much to admire and very little to complain about. If your taste runs toward the traditional, you might prefer the 1983 Ponelle production, though that is not without its flaw, too.",1309478400,14,4850,5.02363184079602

A must recording for any serious collector of Wagner.",1236470400,6,311,4.722222222222222
3092701,3,B0012NO92O,"You could say this about any number of Eurotrash productions today - of which this is not one. But the whole point of Tristan is passion and the attempt to merge. The lovers sing in Act 2 about the word ""and"" which separates them and how they might overcome it. How then a production in which they almost never touch? Muller constantly betrays the music. Tristan's entrance in Act 2 is breathless music. Yet Muller has him come on in a slow processional walk. Isolde waits motionless and when Tristan is almost upon her he utters her name. I expected her to jump out of her skin since he was almost at her back and she was totally focused in another direction. Same thing goes with her entrance in the last act. The music surges and yet Isolde greets her dying lover not with passion but with a ritual like advance. Muller bleeds the passion out of the piece in spite of the most passionate music ever written.
 Then there are the incomprehensible elements. What's with the fallen haloes that the characters are saddled with? The lovers haloes drop off when the drink the potion. But King Marke loses his from the second to the third act. Why? What are they? Meier's hair changes color from act to act. She starts off red, then in the second act she is dark with a hint of grey. And who knows what non color she is in act three. Why? Does love age one over night. I thought love gave us life. And what's with the phalanx of armor in the second act? Is this the world that threaten to keep the lovers apart? Only Muller knows and he ain't telling. A symbol that doesn't communicate is not a symbol but a puzzle, and more than that, a distraction.
 Meier's other performance of Tristan on DVD has come in for a lot of criticism. And yes there are the shaving cream, the polka dot dress and yes, that famous sofa. But Konwitschny probes the text and music - he doesn't ignore it or go against it. In that production Tristan does not die (at least to Isolde)  and the lovers are reunited. Against the standard view? Yes. But the text and music are open to such an interpretation.
 What finally gives this Tristan redemption is the performance. This was the first Tristan for both Jerusalem and Meier and they are wonderful. But again they are restrained by the production. Look at Meier in the Munich DVD. She brings the role to vibrant life. Here she is forced to do it all through her voice. This would make a better CD - after all Tristan is ""radio drama"" as Chereau said when they tried to get him for this production. Jerusalem is very good, but if he looked like Danny Kaye in the MET Ring here he has a distracting resemblance to Bernstein. Barenboim shows that this early on he is already one of the truly great Tristan conductors.  Finally I found the sound lacking here. It tends toward stringy and strident. It is certainly not the lush orchestra Tristan needs. And the balance favors the singers more than it should. Barenboim knows how to play for them without any help from the engineers.
 In conclusion: wait for La Scala and hope.",1227916800,16,3042,4.432915921288014

3327185,5,B0012NO92O,"In July, 2007, I started my review of the Barenboim/Ponnelle Tristan und Isolde with the following: ""Tristan Und Isolde is doubtless one of the greatest operas ever written. Unfortunately it has been very badly served by the currently available productions on DVD.""  I then listed the previous ill-conceived and/or incompetent productions before writing about that production to which I gave 5 stars (and which still remains my favourite).

I then gave 5 stars to the Belohlavek/Lehnhoff Tristan which came out in March and thought that there was an embarasse de richesse.  Now, we have yet another excellent (and different) production which, for my taste, has now taken second place.

As with the Barenboim/Ponnelle production (as well as others from Bayreuth), this was recorded on stage, but without an audience.  As a result, everything is as intended, very clear and with the performers not fatigued.  Some might worry about a possible lack of immediacy, but that is not a problem here.

Barenboim's conducting (and the orchestra) seems better than in his previous DVD.  The power and the passion of the score is very much in evidence.  The acting and singing of Waltraud Meier and Siegfried Jerusalem (both singing these roles for the first time) are superb and, in my opinion, unsurpassed on DVD, although Johanna Meier certainly is just about as good.

According to the liner notes, the direction was offered to Chereau, but he declined stating: ""Tristan cannot be staged, it is a radio play"".  It was then offered to Heiner Muller.  And what came out was, in many respects, very static in action.  The set is minimal (a sunken area stage front for Isolde and Brangane with a raised area in back for Tristan and Kurwenal in Act I, rows of breastplates for Act II, and an armchair on ragged crushed stone in Act III.  But the colours set the mood and enhance the action (such as it is) with many abstract Rathko-like rectangles for the preludes in the colours of the acts: red, orange and yellow in Act I, dark shades of blue for Act II, and washed out sand-grey for Act III until the Liebestod when Isolde is in silver/gold before a warm coloured backdrop.

But despite the absence of much vigorous action, the body language of the performers makes everything very clear.  I was at first puzzled at the lack of physical contact between Tristan and Isolde, particularly during the very erotic/romantic music of Act II.  But that surely is what Wagner wrote the opera about -- yearning, frustrating, unconsummated love which can only find fulfillment in death.  Tristan, self absorbed, led up to the idea of death while Isolde, Wagner's woman, tried to make contact but had to follow Tristan's lead.  Their continual coming close and then separating, hardly touching, added considerably to the tension to the point where I wanted to call out to them to get on with it. The only time there seemed to be any mutual tenderness was finally when Isolde agreed to follow Tristan, just before he allowed himself to be stabbed.  Quite disturbing, but a successful execution of a director's concept.

However, when a director uses symbols there can be misinterpretation, particularly for a cross-cultural viewer.  He can do what David Alden did in his somewhat bizarre ""Tannhauser"" and throw in scores hoping that some will be able to be interpreted.  But Muller in this spare production has very few.  I can understand (I think) the shoulder yokes on (and off) the characters -- but if anyone can come up with a plausible interpretation of he rows of breastplates in Act II, I would be grateful for an explanation.
My only other (personal) reservation is that I have never liked the voice of Falk Struckmann.  He is younger here (as Kurwenal) than in the other DVD's which I have seen; but he still sounds harsh, cold and dry.

All told, one of the best productions of this great opera.  Highly recommended.",1219708800,27,3905,4.859516616314199
3327186,5,B0012NO92O,"This is a truly great performance of this opera.  The singing is superb, especially that of Waltrud Meier, whose facial expressiveness is well caught on this video production.  The orchestral playing wonderful and Barenboim's interpretation captures the emotional depth of the music.  Highly recommended as a performance.

This issue is offered in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1.  The seemingly total lack of audience noise suggests it was recorded (like the Ponnelle version) without an audience present. The DTS version presents a broader soundstage with more bass, but it takes a while to get used to the reverberant sound of the voices.  The PCM version sounds more natural in that respect.  There was some inconsistancy in the recorded sound, sometimes sounding closely miked, at other times more distant.  But this was not a serious problem.

The video reproduction is in widescreen format.  The picture is flawless with no detectable video artifacts and presented in gorgeously reproduced color.

The sets and stage direction for this production are somewhat problematic for me.  The booklet notes led me to expect a much more austere production than is actually presented.  The Rothko like color sets enhance the music nicely, especially in the first and last acts, and wonderfully in the golden/red glow of the final Liebestod.  The set and staging for the second act was, however, a disappointment for me.  My first response to the rows of armor was to be reminded of the rows of alien pods in the crashed spaceship from the first Alien movie, an image I haven't been able to erase from my mind.  Isolde begins the act holding a pair of shoes in her hand, an image I found distracting and meaningless.  The physical interaction between the two singers did not seem as ""carefully restricted"" as the booklet notes suggested it would be, but I felt that it lacked the intimacy that the music portrays. Wagner's stage directions (in this production ignored) indicating that Tristan should stretch out his cloak to hide Isolde when the lovers are discovered suggest a lot more was going on between the two (wonderfully captured by the music) than can be expected to be shown on a live stage.  If you want to see the ""real"" thing, watch the Tristan sequence in the movie Excalibur.

I would say that the musical interpretation of Levine is somewhat deeper (when I turn off the video) and that the sets of Ponnelle are more to my liking (except for the revisionist ending), but this is the better video all around.",1219449600,15,2514,4.900709219858156
3327187,5,B0012NO92O,"Wagner's operas are well represented on DVD. There are three excellent Rings, several superb Meistersingers, Parsifals in all flavours, Lohengrins by the ton, and a couple of good Hollanders.  Up until now there has only been one Tristan worth watching - the 1983 Bayreuth production conducted by Barenboim and directed by Ponnelle.

I believe that this 1993 Bayreuth production, also conducted by Barenboim, surpasses the earlier recording.

Why? Let's start with the principals.

Meyer and Jerusalem have great stage presence, wonderful voices and, unlike some others I've seen in these roles, are very capable actors. Waltraut Meyer is at her peak - quite frankly, I've never heard her sing as well as she does in this production (and she normally sings very well indeed). Jerusalem sails through the difficult third act, exercising his vocal and acting skills to the full.
Barenboim matches the orchestra to the singers with amazing precision - not once did the opera overpower the voices, and not once was there a sense of holding back to let inadequate voices have their chance. This is particularly tricky in Liebestod, where the orchestra has a lot to say, but mustn't drown Isolde. The combination of Meyer, Barenboim, and of course, Bayreuth produced the most perfect Liebestod I've ever heard.

The supporting roles were well played. Konig Marke was sympathetically portrayed by Mattias Holle. Kurvenal and Brangane were excellent.

I suppose I should mention the slightly Eurodaft staging. Some odd decisions here, although they couldn't detract from the gesamtkunstwerk.
-  The strange plexiglass harnesses worn throughout act 1 (which I imagine symbolized inhibition, since they fell off after the love draught)
-  The vaguely Chinese costume and scenery (borrowed, I think, by the designer of the Met's current, lacklustre staging)
-  The brief flash of red light when Tristan and Isolda succumb to the love draught (another idea borrowed by the Met)
However, unlike the Met, this was not a static, formalized, passionless performance. Tristan can be the most glacially slow of Wagner's operas if played without conviction, but this production conveyed the opera's essential passion.

This is apparently the first release of this performance in any format. It's quite amazing how a gem like this can lie hidden for fifteen years.

Technicalities; wide screen picture, synthesised DTS 5.1 sound; both superb.

Strongly recommended. Almost as good as a trip to Bayreuth.",1216684800,65,2483,5.290076335877862
3327188,5,B0012NO92O,"I can't resist the chance to write the first review of this DVD, even though it has not yet been released, and the only version I have seen is a disc in somewhat soft focus and with no subtitles (but an unbeatable price) from Premiere Opera.  That said, I will go out on a limb and proclaim this as my favorite ""Tristan"" DVD.

It's true that this Heiner Muller production faces very strong competition from both the Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and Nikolaus Lehnhoff versions--all three are visually and conceptually striking (Peter Konwitschny's production, probably the most daring of all, has some brilliant moments but is saddled with too many inexplicable, maddening misfires to stand in the first rank).  If Amazon someday releases last year's televised La Scala performance directed by Patrice Chereau, which (like the Muller and Ponnelle) features Barenboim conducting and (like the Muller and Konwitschny) offers Waltraud Meier as Isolde, it will most likely join the above big three in the upper echelon.

Like Ponnelle and Lehnhoff, Muller creates an arrestingly beautiful production, though more austere than the other two. The German playwright allegedly tried to take a colder, more clinical view of Wagner's great paean to unfulfilled passion, but his Bayreuth ""Tristan"" manages to be all the more affecting because of its sober restraint (a restraint very much in keeping, after all, with Wagner's lovers, who spend an entire stolen night of love doing nothing but philosophizing). The production is abstract but visually enticing, featuring a recurring motif of vibrant, luminous squares reminiscent of Rothko's paintings (during the preludes to each of the three acts, the camera slowly pans across a number of thematically related abstract paintings--a far more satisfying visual complement to the music than is found in either the Ponelle or Lehnhoff videos).

Muller is helped immeasurably by his two leads, both assuming their respective roles for the first time.  The young Waltraud Meier is an even better actress (and even more beautiful) than the formidable Nina Stemme in the Lehnhoff production (and preferable on both counts to Johanna Meier in the Ponnelle). Some have objected on principle to a mezzo singing Isolde, but I find Meier up to the role's vocal demands, particularly at this relatively early point in her career.  And while she apparently didn't enjoy working under Muller's direction, her mesmerizing performance is nonetheless the soul of this production.  Siegfried Jerusalem, his hair effectively pulled back in a tight ponytail, seems to me vocally and visually preferable to both Rene Kollo for Ponnelle and John Gambill for Lehnhoff, though he is less varied than either as an actor, particularly in the great test of the wounded knight's Act III delirium.

To touch upon some of the production's more distinctive features . . . Act I takes place in a stark, simple boxlike set in browns and golds, with Isolde's chamber appearing as no more than a recessed section at the front of the raked stage.  All the characters wear severe black cassocks, along with odd but strangely arresting clear plastic yokes which signify their enthrallment to the mundane world of obligations and social ties (the lovers remove theirs upon drinking the love potion).  The great second act love duet takes place, not in a garden, but amidst rows of armored breastplates, suggesting an armory or a graveyard, and perhaps indicating the soulless uniformity against which the lovers try to carve out their fragile union.  The lovers are still in black, but now wear more flowing robes with blue accents that effectively match the colored streaks in their hair.  In keeping with Muller's cooler view, the rapturous meeting of the lovers is studiously underplayed and they remain reticent about making actual contact, but nonetheless at key moments the camera closes in on striking, still tableaus of them sitting back to back or in each other's arms.  The bleak final act is set in a large yet claustrophic box strewn with rubble, the characters dressed in dirty, ragged coats.  It's Wagner by way of Samuel Beckett's ""Endgame,"" a notion brilliantly crystallized in the presence of a blind watchman, evoking the utter futility of Tristan's longing for Isolde.  Towards the end of the opera, Muller shows his disdain for Wagner's rather hasty fight sequences by rendering them in what has to be the most perfunctory stage combat ever seen.  But Meier's final liebestod, rapturously sung as she stands in a luminous golden gown against a glowing gold square, ends the performance on an image of sublime, ethereal beauty reminiscent of early Italian Renaissance religious iconography.

Having gone on at such length already, I'll conclude this discussion, sit back, and wait to see if other reviewers share my enthusiasm for this wonderful production.",1215388800,72,4867,5.1704834605597965

The music was riveting, Siegfried Jerusalem came through in the last act, and  Meier stole the show. However, we were not entirely impressed with Muller's staging; while there were interesting elements of modernistic symbolism, the sets were static, and not enough to hold visual attention through the opera.",1313452800,5,394,5.253968253968254
3327195,4,B0012NO92O,"I bought this and the previous Bayreuth/Barenboim production DVD at the same time, so comparisons will be inevitable. This performance of Wagner's monumental ode to passion stands at the very top of the list.

Every conductor who plays this music well (and in Wagner we MUST consider the conducting first) brings to it a distinctive style. Furtwngler, a delicacy and lyricism; Karajan's is languid sensuality; Bhm's is white hot urgency. Barenboim finds a balance of lyricism and passion and a sense of dramatic detail much like Carlos Kleiber's, which is here recorded better and in clearer balance with the stage than in the 1983 Ponelle production. His tendency toward abrupt changes of tempo is a little less evident than in the earlier video.

The cast is consistently very good, if not consistently great. Uta Priew is a good Brangne, not quite in the class of Hanna Schwarz or Stephanie Blythe (no one is in the class of Christa Ludwig...well, maybe Brigitte Fassbnder). Falk Struckmann is a fine Kurwenal, and all of the smaller parts are more than adequate. Matthias Hlle's King Marke, however handsomely sung fails to convey much of the inner conflict, outward hurt, anger, and disappointment, and struggling compassion that can make his 12 minute monologue a real highlight of the 2nd act, not merely something to be 'got through.' Matti Salminen, in the Ponelle/Bayreuth production, does just that.

Which brings us to the title characters. While neither has the opulent tone of a Melchior or Vinay, Flagstad or Nilsson, neither do they fall far short as interpretive artists. When this production premiered two years earlier (1992), both Siegfried Jerusalem and Waltraud Meier were singing these roles for the first time.  After a couple of years, and some performances elsewhere, both were well settled into the parts, both vocally and dramatically. Meier, originally a mezzo, was utterly at her peak at this time. She is also a strikingly beautiful stage presence and an excellent actor. Her singing is secure and full of detail, and every word is clear and effective. Jerusalem is at the disadvantage of having begun his singing career late: a bassoonist until age 35, his technique is less well developed than a singer who started earlier. He is a splendid artist, though, and always conveys a profoundly poetic sense of the text with exquisite phrasing and musicality. He does appear to working harder at it than is ideal, but opera is not an artform designed for close-ups.

The production, by one of Germany's pre-eminent dramatists, is challenging and thought provoking, but not so much as to be at odds with either music or text.
It is most successful, and attractive, in the 1st and 3rd acts. The scenery, by Austrain designer Erik Wonder, is highly abstract, like paintings by Mark Rothko and Joseph Albers. Simple form and color define Act One's ship, with a small sunken rectangle for Isolde's claustrophobic cabin area. The chorus is never seen, and only the King's silhouette appears at the end of the act. Costumes are by Paris based Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto. Dark, severe robes give way to less restrained clothing when the lovers drink the potion. All wear clear plastic cage-like appliances around their shoulder, symbolic of inhibition or societal constraint. These come off with Tristan and Isolde's outer robes.

The Third Act is the most successful. I found it absolutely riveting. The stage is strewn with ash and rubble, and the few pieces of furniture draped in the same grey. A few simple shapes define an abstract space in Rothko fashion. Jerusalem is marvelously eloquent here, and Struckmann's Kurwenal is touching, and a blind shepherd gropes about the rubble field. Isolde's dark shift is transformed to shimmering gold for the Liebestod.

Which leaves us with the problematic Second Act. A dark blue and grey space for the castle garden is filled with row after row of armor breastplates, arranged like identical tombstones in a military cemetery. I have less of a problem with that image than how it is used. The lovers wander back and forth through this field during the extensive love music: rarely together, without physical or eye contact. The viewer is forced to grapple with this contradiction to the point that immersion in the all-engulfing tide of passionate music becomes difficult, if not impossible. In the theater one can simple close one's eyes, but at home too many distractions invite us to get up and do something else.

If your tastes run to more radical stagings you will probably like this production. I find it vastly superior to the MET's sterile and dehumanizing staging. Musically, there is much to admire and very little to complain about. If your taste runs toward the traditional, you might prefer the 1983 Ponelle production, though that is not without its flaw, too.",1309478400,14,4850,5.02363184079602

A must recording for any serious collector of Wagner.",1236470400,6,311,4.722222222222222
3327198,3,B0012NO92O,"You could say this about any number of Eurotrash productions today - of which this is not one. But the whole point of Tristan is passion and the attempt to merge. The lovers sing in Act 2 about the word ""and"" which separates them and how they might overcome it. How then a production in which they almost never touch? Muller constantly betrays the music. Tristan's entrance in Act 2 is breathless music. Yet Muller has him come on in a slow processional walk. Isolde waits motionless and when Tristan is almost upon her he utters her name. I expected her to jump out of her skin since he was almost at her back and she was totally focused in another direction. Same thing goes with her entrance in the last act. The music surges and yet Isolde greets her dying lover not with passion but with a ritual like advance. Muller bleeds the passion out of the piece in spite of the most passionate music ever written.
 Then there are the incomprehensible elements. What's with the fallen haloes that the characters are saddled with? The lovers haloes drop off when the drink the potion. But King Marke loses his from the second to the third act. Why? What are they? Meier's hair changes color from act to act. She starts off red, then in the second act she is dark with a hint of grey. And who knows what non color she is in act three. Why? Does love age one over night. I thought love gave us life. And what's with the phalanx of armor in the second act? Is this the world that threaten to keep the lovers apart? Only Muller knows and he ain't telling. A symbol that doesn't communicate is not a symbol but a puzzle, and more than that, a distraction.
 Meier's other performance of Tristan on DVD has come in for a lot of criticism. And yes there are the shaving cream, the polka dot dress and yes, that famous sofa. But Konwitschny probes the text and music - he doesn't ignore it or go against it. In that production Tristan does not die (at least to Isolde)  and the lovers are reunited. Against the standard view? Yes. But the text and music are open to such an interpretation.
 What finally gives this Tristan redemption is the performance. This was the first Tristan for both Jerusalem and Meier and they are wonderful. But again they are restrained by the production. Look at Meier in the Munich DVD. She brings the role to vibrant life. Here she is forced to do it all through her voice. This would make a better CD - after all Tristan is ""radio drama"" as Chereau said when they tried to get him for this production. Jerusalem is very good, but if he looked like Danny Kaye in the MET Ring here he has a distracting resemblance to Bernstein. Barenboim shows that this early on he is already one of the truly great Tristan conductors.  Finally I found the sound lacking here. It tends toward stringy and strident. It is certainly not the lush orchestra Tristan needs. And the balance favors the singers more than it should. Barenboim knows how to play for them without any help from the engineers.
 In conclusion: wait for La Scala and hope.",1227916800,16,3042,4.432915921288014
8246887,5,B0012NO92O,"If theres a correlation between how impassioned a performance of Tristan und Isolde is and the amount of spit flying around onstage, then based on the expectoration of the singers alone this was a winning night indeed. Based on other factors, too. In fact, Im not quite sure how I managed to miss this DVD for as long as I did, considering how much I love this opera and my admiration for the singers and the conductor. I own four other video performances of Tristan und Isolde, all of which are fine on the whole, though each is lacking in some area. Not so in this case. This is as close to perfection as you're likely to get, with the musical aspect unparalleled and the stage production generally excellent, with only a few minor issues that fail to hinder the overall enjoyment. I might be late coming to this DVD, but at least Ive been making up for lost time. The package arrived only a few days ago and Ive already watched it twice!

This is a Bayreuth production from 1995 conducted by Daniel Barenboim. Maestro Barenboim is a master of this score, perfectly balancing the orchestra with the voices rather than against them, slowing down when most effective but also emphasizing the dramatic and headlong nature of the piece, the continual buildup to its shattering climax.

Waltraud Meier is a preeminent Isodle, her tireless voice never shirking in its commitment to the drama and of course heavenly throughout. And shes also one of the most physically striking Isoldes on record. To give you an idea of this, Meier still looks great even today, for instance as Sieglinde in the recent La Scala Ring Cycle, and the performance here was twenty years before that. In this particular staging, hers is a rather detached beauty, especially in the first act and then later when confronted by King Marke about her infidelity with Tristan, where she stands back and observes his devastated monologue, unrepentant and generally unaffected, which makes her unattainability all the more crushing. Well, perhaps the fact that the old boy loves Tristan more than his wife since he barely even mentions her while describing the depths of his heartbreak and betrayal is reason enough for her to be a bit indifferent about the whole affair. Considering the length of the role, and how she has substantial singing to do in each of the three acts, even the third where shes offstage for much of the time and then is expected to come back and deliver a ravishing finale, its almost miraculous how she never shies away from the vocal challenges but instead confronts them viscerally and with immense feeling. So exultant is Meiers Liebestod that it almost seems like a happy ending.

Siegfried Jerusalem has always been one of the more virile of the great heldentenors, and here he tempers this tangible masculinity with the appropriate amount of maturity, and introspection. We see none of the callowness of, say, a Siegfried or Parsifal, but a grown man fully cognizant of the consequences of his actions but unable to forestall the tragic spate of destiny. Thus, the madness we witness in the final act comes across as a natural extension of his earlier anxiety and self-doubts.

Its rare to see a King Marke on video that isn't Matti Salminen or Rene Pape, but in this case I wouldnt trade either of those great singers for Matthias Holle. His is a deeply human basso voice which is ideal in this role, an emotionally vulnerable king who apparently rules by compassion instead of might, who values his interpersonal relationships more than he does his great power. His regret during the final scene as well as his despair over so much needless bloodshed is as powerful a thing to behold as Isoldes ethereal transfiguration a few seconds later.

Speaking of transformations, its worth noting how Falk Struckmann takes the character of Kurwenal from posturing sycophant in the first act to noble ally with hidden treasures of feeling in the third, as his lord and paragon Tristan lies dying. His devotion to his liege, in addition to his self-abnegation, are so emotionally expressed that his character graduates from secondary to crucial. And Uta Priews Brangane is without peer. Aside from the operas prelude and later the Liebestod, her character is given the most beautiful moment here, during act two where shes watching over the incautious lovers and her haunting solo momentarily interrupts their duet, and Priews delivery floats on currents of gorgeous sound. This entire performance is a vocal and dramatic banquet, and given the opportunity what lover of this music wouldnt want to experience that?

As for the production, Heiner Muller smartly stages things with very few set pieces, depending on light and shadows and the positioning of human bodies to achieve his effects. A minimalistic style is the best and maybe the only way to approach this opera, possibly because there isn't a lot of spectacle or pageantry or even real action to speak of, its a four hour opera where the basic plot could be described in just a few words. The true architecture of the piece is the characters psychologies, the philosophical ideas being imparted, most importantly the music. Plus such a barebones staging tends to augment the operas overall atmosphere of starkness.

There are a few bizarre touches (arent there always?), such as the characters wearing plastic tubes around their necks, like collars of ownership, which suggests enslavement of some kind, perhaps psychological. And act two takes place amid rows of breastplates lined up like pews in a church, perhaps alluding to the spiritual nature of the piece in addition to the eternal conflict between day and night, the combative forces at work throughout. Some traditionalists might object to these things, though they didn't bother me, my few grouses reflect those points where what were seeing is needlessly at odds with the narrative.

For instance. Musically and dramatically, one of the most staggering moments in the opera comes during the second act, where Tristan and Isoldes love duet is interrupted by Melot leading King Marke into their hiding place to witness their illicit tryst. Here their entrance is delayed and proceeded by shadows and fails to live up to Wagners accompanying music, in effect vitiating the drama. Also, a couple of times when someone is run through by a spear its because he purposely walks into it rather than being felled at the hands of his opponent. I suppose this is meant to delineate the self-destructive natures of the characters, but Wagner already does this convincingly enough with his text and his music, making the effect unnecessary not to mention rather silly. A couple of questions: Why does Kurwenal spend the third act looking like the lead singer for a 1980s synth rock outfit? And why isn't the mournful piper ever seen actually playing his pipes? We hear the music, we know hes the one providing it, yet he spends his whole time onstage sitting around with his hands on his lap and staring into space behind dark glasses, with not a musical instrument in sight. I didn't find these things distracting necessarily, just odd, because of the overall success of the performance, the music, the dramaturgy, also the choreography, the positioning of the singing actors which establishes their various conflicts. These are accomplished so well that focusing on any minor idiosyncrasies sounds like quibbling.

People reading this are likely already familiar with the opera so there isn't much point in raving about the glories of Wagners score, but Im going to do it anyway, although unlike the composer Ill try to be brief. Wagners earlier opera Tannhauser is about the clash between eroticism and spirituality, therefore he gave each of these ideas its own individual motifs that are often in competition with each other. In Tristan und Isolde, eroticism and spirituality aren't necessarily antithetical, they're both elements of immortal love, therefore they come together simultaneously in a kind of divine fusion thats unlike any other opera, any other music, a gorgeous dissertation on love and death and redemption and transfiguration that flows uninterrupted through each of its swiftly-moving acts.

I often cite the Ring Cycle as the greatest operatic work in all creation, but when it comes to greatest individual opera its a bit more complicated. The Ring operas on their own are automatically disqualified because they're so interdependent on each other and the cycle on the whole is so much greater than its individual parts. So I guess it comes down to this opera or Otello (and my apologies to Mr. Mozart, not that some of his superior pieces aren't in the running). I usually give the edge to the Verdi masterpiece, because of the brilliant way it incorporates traditional opera into a such a modern-sounding work (even today), its subtlety and psychological penetration, and just the sheer intensity of the drama and beauty of the music, the emotional devastation. The fact that it isn't an opera thats larger than life but IS life. But after watching a performance as nearly perfect as this one, one of my top five DVD purchases and a must have for any collector, I might have to give Tristan und Isolde some careful consideration. On the other hand, why don't I just call it a tie for the time being and leave it at that? Both operas give me so much pleasure that there really isn't much point in picking a winner.

But I should probably shut up already. I read once that when Wagner was planning Tristan und Isolde he originally envisioned it as a short and simple bel canto piece as a break from working on the Ring Cycle. And look what happened. Well, I initially intended this review to be a few informative paragraphs, long on pithy insights and short on volubility. And look what happened. Leb wohl, friends, until the next review.",1523145600,,9860,4.915915915915916
8246888,5,B0012NO92O,"Im interested only in expressing basic human emotions  tragedy, ecstasy, doom. Mark Rothko. Wagner, too, is after primal emotions, and this is why Heiner Mller stages Tristan und Isolde through the lens of Rothko. This version is fearlessly abstract and singularly intense. Mller understands that the restrained gesture can be more powerful than the expansive one, and he carries that insight through to all aspects of the production. His is a work of distillation: it concentrates our awareness of the frightening paradoxes of erotic love. A confronting experience.",1474848000,,566,5.431818181818182

It is a shame, this is a great DVD so reasonable but after I see it I understand. fantastic production.",1469232000,,313,4.709090909090909

8246894,2,B0012NO92O,"It seems a waste --- they have great opera stars, and then the staging was spoiled by......plastic tubing hooked around the actor's shoulders?? Also, they all wore black choir robes, no color, no nothing, at least in the first act, which is all I am likely to see. I tried to figure out what was the plastic tubing FOR, and considered perhaps it was to represent Elizabethan ruffs? But of course the T & I story predates that fashion by some centuries, so that doesn't make sense.
Bad: horrible, horrible staging.
Good: at least now I finally understand what the word ""Eurotrash"" means when applied to opera.",1397692800,4,608,4.691588785046729
8246895,1,B0012NO92O,"I would give this zero stars but one is the lower limit. I asked my wife to get this for me for my birthday, figuring that with the stars involved it had to be good. I was wrong. So far we've watched the first act and may not watch the rest. All of the characters in the first act were dressed in black choir robes with strange Plexiglas tubing fixtures on their shoulders. It looked like they had about $10 for costumes and props and probably didn't spend the whole allocation. This added nothing to the presentation and was frankly very distracting. Why do these medieval people have plastic tubing harnesses? A lot of talent wasted on a schlock production in my opinion.",1397606400,9,673,4.479674796747967
8246896,5,B0012NO92O,"Outstanding singing and costumes.  Set too stark.  Like to see orchestra in preludes.  Everyone should see and hear Frau Walter sing the final ""Lebestode,"" spectacular, and worth the entire opera.",1394928000,,196,5.466666666666667
