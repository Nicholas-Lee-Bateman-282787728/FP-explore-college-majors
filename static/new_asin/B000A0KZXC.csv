8071533,1,B000A0KZXC,"if seeking the German DVD release of this film at amazon.de, search under the German title 'Sch?ner Gigolo, armer Gigolo'.  That DVD, which has different timings from the Australian release, offers both the German-language and the English-language versions of the film.  Of course, it's region 2, meaning that customers in the US and Canada will need a multi-region DVD player to view it.",1146096000,5,388,5.142857142857143

8071535,1,B000A0KZXC,"As mentioned in the inside liner notes for this release, the print that was used was salvage from a fire, and then mastered for this release, parts are strangely bright and scenes with Dietrich were cut abruptly. Although the film is a letterbox version, I cannot recommend this copy. It seems Amazon Germany now as another release that looks promising, well there goes more money to burn!",1137801600,5,389,4.82089552238806
