553576,4,630309192X,"Two mercenaries plan and execute an operation to retrieve diamonds under the guise of a rescue mission deep in the war-torn Congo.  Rod Taylor is in fine form as Captain Curry and Jim Brown (former Pro-Football star) does a credible job as Curry's right-hand man Sergeant Ruffo.  Actor Peter Carsten as the Ex-Nazi Captain Henlein who accompanies the duo with a force of government soldiers is downright villainous.

The heat is turned up as Curry and Ruffo race against time to negotiate UN forces lines and reach a remote village, where the diamonds are kept, before a large rebel force arrives.  All of this is executed on a railroad train specially modified for the mission.  Tension is high as the rebel forces close in on Curry and Ruffo as they try to evacuate the village's inhabitants and the diamonds.  Henlein seriously complicates the mission when he reveals his true intent for being on the operation.

The action is good and surprisingly violent for a movie of this time, thus this feature is not recommended for children's viewing.  The cinematography is good and the instrumental soundtrack has a distinctive ""60s"" appeal that provides an intensive mood for the film.  Overall a very good war drama deserving of a DVD release.",944870400,13,1242,4.904306220095694

553794,4,630309192X,"The story is based on an actual episode in history, and presents a fast-paced, well acted action drama.  I have watched the movie several times during the years, and I always enjoy Rod Taylor's strong no-nonsense portrayal of a mercenary leading a diverse group of men to ""liberate"" a cache of diamonds before the Congolese rebels overrun the town.  The film was probably filmed on location and the cinematography is in-your-face sun, heat, and jungle.  It''s a much faster paced version of Tears of the Sun with Bruce Willis, also right up there with Where Eagles Dare with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood.  Both Dark of the Sun and Where Eagles Dare are enhanced by taunt, dramatic acting, a pleasure to watch.",1456012800,,714,4.827868852459017

553796,4,630309192X,"From a Wilbur Smith book, who went on to write some very compelling action stories with a background of African history, a very masculine film about mercenaries in the Congo circa 1950s or 60s.  I thought that Taylor and Brown were good as buddies in and at war, beholden to each other.  Great cinematography and train action.  The requisite female role could have been left out or done more with.  Not part of the action.  Over all a satisfying action adventure film, though it seems the this version is heavily edited for violence.  Would like to see a restored version.",1444608000,,572,4.67

Some of us go one step further and need to own a copy of this classic because it's just that good. Dark of the Sun captures the brutality of the Congo in the 196o's and the mercenraries who found employment there. (Its European title is, in fact, The Mercenaries.) It's also one of my top three favourite Rod Taylor roles. I can't recommend Dark of the Sun highly enough.",1444176000,2,456,4.252873563218391

553865,5,630309192X,"Fantastic film. A real lost gem. Mercenaries on a mission. Violent for the time but nothing overly graphic or extreme (with one exception which I will get to). Rod Taylor is terrific - playing the hard as nails, cynical mercenary. Jim Brown plays against type and is the nice guy of the pair. This is a great ride... we even get a Nazi with a chainsaw.... all of that being said there is one scene wherein the aforementioned Nazi guns down two small children... as a dad I found this disturbing and unneccesary but as I have a yound son I may be overly sensative... The picture and sound are both very good (fair warning - I am not an audio or video-phile just a movie buff).

Rod and his crew are hired by the President of the Congo to retrieve 50 million dollars worth of diamonds and rescue some Europeans from the hands of the evil faction looking to overthrow the government.

554009,4,630309192X,"I'm a big Rod Taylor fan from BIRDS and TIME MACHINE, so it was fun to 'discover' this 1968 film.
When I wrote this review in Nov. 2014, Mr. Taylor was still alive and with us. Not long after I posted this review came the sad news of his passing. A wonderful actor and a great screen presence and by all accounts a very fine human being. Rest in Peace, Mr. Taylor, and thank you.

As other reviewers have said, there are no 'bonus features' included with this DVD-- no voiceover commentary, no interviews, nothing at all but the film itself. Too bad, because Taylor and others were still around to be interviewed and share their memories of the making. I enjoyed it--Taylor is unexpectedly tough, even fierce as an 'action hero', and this casually ferocious 1968 role is a far remove from his 1960 idealistic time traveller.

This is a mostly factual story set amid the unbelievable savagery and animalistic butchery of the 1964 Katanga Rebellion in the Congo. If anything, the violence and savagery depicted on film still omits the worst of the horrors that actually transpired. So, be prepared--this is not about some irritable seagulls trying to get a peck at Tippi Hedren.
Despite the comic book box art, this is not a movie I'd see with kids unless I'd viewed it first.

As others have said, this version is obviously heavily edited to delete a lot of violence which actually took place only four years before the filming, but was deemed too intense for many audiences. As best I can determine, this DVD version is the same version I saw recently broadcast on Cable.

The ending-- a climactic fatal showdown with the Evil Treacherous Mercenary who has murdered Jim Brown, assaulted Mimieux and who we have been rooting to die since his first attempt to kill Taylor early in the film--  appears to have been heavily edited as well.
The end of the film left us shaking our heads--it's illogical, senseless, totally out of character, and completely unsatisfying as an ending. If this was the original 1968 theatrical-release ending, I can see how this seriously harmed the film at the box office.

In interviews, Taylor has said that he had an extensive hand in rewriting the screenplay, and the ending. I'd like to know more about how that unsatisfying ending came about. If anyone knows, please share it in the Comments section below.

As an action picture (and now a period piece as well) this is a gripping, fast paced, tightly edited thriller, and it works. Taylor is tough and casually lethal, but likeable, and I'll agree with those who say he would have made a good James Bond.
Ladies will enjoy that Taylor is tanned, fit and wearing khaki shorts for the entire picture. The plot--Taylor is hired run a special express train to rescue endangered Belgian missionaries and retrieve $50,000,000 in diamonds to keep the newly postcolonial Congo government from imminent collapse -- is plausible and mostly based on actual historical events.

I'd like to give this 5 Stars, but honestly that awful illogical unsatisfying ending just up-ends the whole applecart for me. Still, Taylor is well worth spending 90 minutes with, the scenery is handsome and the sense of Africa in chaos is well evoked.

Even with the heavy editing, there's still plenty of explicit brutality here, mostly black-on-white, including sadistic murders of helpless white women and children, the gang rape and implied murder of missionary nuns, and at least one male gang rape of one of Taylor's captured soldiers. I would not watch this with anyone younger than 16.
Unlike much cinema gore today, this is grittily realistic, reenactment of then-recent murders of real people, not some anime/comic book/'Machete Kills' nonsense.

4 Stars for Rod Taylor and a brave script that captures a truly savage era in African history. I'd like to see an uncut version. And I'd really, really like to see an alternate ending--ANY alternate ending. If nothing else, end it and roll credits after Taylor struggles to his feet battered but alive after despatching the Bad Guy. A better, wiser edit would let the story end right there.

Hope this is helpful, especially to fellow Taylor fans. He had that rare gift, like Gable before him and Clooney after, of appealing equally to men and women alike, a good face without being a pretty boy, a likeable onscreen presence without being smarmy.
We need more Rod Taylor's today.

Happy viewing, and enjoy.",1416614400,3,4414,4.847277556440903

554080,4,630309192X,"Wilbur Smith wrote boys' own adventure yarns with an inevitable (if improbable) love interest. There's more though: he uses his novels to plug his now-unfashionable racial attitudes, always cloaked with an Uncle Tom character, and also trades in a much more fashionable (if not universally accurate) view of the involvement of capitalism and, for good measure, communism in the ruin of Africa. The film has it all, fairly competently rendered, with some (but not all) of the gratuitous sadism of the novel tossed in, along with a full-blown nazi and a bizarre, syrupy ending which poses almost unbearable strain on the viewer's credulity. None of that much impeded the influence which the film had in its time: much like that of the ""Die hard"" films of more recent times. My own interest in the film arises from the fact that part of my childhood was spent in the area in which it was filmed, and glimpses of the leading actors occasioned much puerile excitement at the time.

mercenary's adventures in Africa. I was fortunate enough to see this film in the theater in it's 1968 release. And it was
surely ahead of it's time. For years, I only had a vhs tape recording from PBS showing to relive this fine film. Finally, several
months ago, I secured the remastered dvd version from Amazon. After viewing it a couple of times, it renewed my belief in
the fine acting, story line, brutal realism, and stirring musical score, that I had remembered from my youth. Even though
her part was minimal, the pairing of Rod Taylor & Yvette Mimieux brought back the (magic) memories of their performances
in 1960's The Time Machine. Finally, would like to quote the movie critic for movies on tv from the NY Times:""Congo mercenaries & refugees. Vivid, boiling adventure that ends too abruptly. We wanted more"". Couldn't have said it any better!",1337126400,2,979,4.798816568047338

The plot had a lot of potential (organize a train to rescue the residents of a Congolese town full of Europeans from the rebel Simbas... and collect a fortune in diamonds in the process) and the costumes and the locations were great. BUT certain bits in the film didn't make sense: why did the mercenary captain in charge need the ex-Nazi to complete the mission (it couldn't be because his African troops had any sense of loyalty to him)? Why was the Congolese NCO only a senior sergeant (in the Congo following independence education and military experience amongst Africans was at a premium and a man of his ability would have been an officer)? Why would the train commander allow the German guy to get away with attacking him with a chainsaw (nobody needs somebody else this bad!)?

Strangely the congo once again has seen 5 million dead in the last decade alone! So they have returned to this mindless slaughtering again. A sad  story to be sure. THis story htough is fictional and even with that the scenes of the beserk rebels killing and raping people are terrible to behold. After all many people did die like that back then and are still dying like that today there. The dvd is remastered and worth owning for that reason as well. This is the story of mercenaries who go after daimonds and refugees for the new congo government that was just independant. If they had just gone after people then they could  have rescued far more  people. As it is the story is sad and it even has a nasty nazi in it. Which is not needed but interesting.

Rod Taylor at the peak of his art and retired Cleveland Browns quarterback Jim Brown play mercenaries hired to enlist an army of men to rescue over 60 civilians trapped in the middle of the Simba rebellion at Port Reprieve but there is a catch, they are also told to retrieve $50 million in cut diamonds to be returned to the Belgian Mining Company.  Along the way mistakes are made by every one involved causing tragedy and bloodshed till its final fade out.  Along for the ride are actors Peter Carsten in an extremely villainous performance, Yvette Mimieux playing a grieving widow and makes it sort of a reunion with Taylor having both starred in Director George Pal's 'THE TIME MACHINE' seven years before, Kenneth More as an alcoholic medic who makes a great sacrifice and Andre Morell who mistakenly puts the diamonds in a timed vault three hours too long and which causes disastrous results.  Director Jack Cardiff who also was Great Britain's lead cinematographer utilises cameraman Edward Scaife in composing some startlingly realistic images showing the brutality of the rampaging, out of control Simbas.  Add an enthralling music score by Jacques Loussier and a nail biting script by Quentin Werty and Adrien Spies and you have one of the most underrated action films of the sixties.

Some compare this film to ""The Wild Geese"" which is a movie I like very much with Richard Burton and Richard Harris playing merecenary's who also go into Africa to do some damage. Here Rod Taylor (taking every chance to be on screen in no shirt) is the leader of men (Jim Brown & Kenneth Moore) doing the deed. The action scenes are almost 'catoonish' they are so poorly done. Several reviewers mention the extreme violence of this film which it has but its all so poorly done I found myself laughing at what I was watching. My favorite scene is when a bad guy goes after Rod Taylor with a chain saw--but the bad guy gets the worst of it. And the film becomes totally ridiculous when Yvette Mimieux comes on board and instantly has the 'hots' for Rod Taylor. Nothing about this film works in my view. Jim Brown is great--in the ""Dirty Dozen""; Kenneth Moore is great--in ""Sink the Bismark""; and Rod Taylor is ok in ""36 Hours"", but all 3 are in an awful film here.

554374,4,630309192X,"Dark Of The Sun happens to be one of the greatest action packed films of the 1960s.  This is the first film that I know of that actually has a realistic, nasty chain-saw fight. So you know from where it comes. Some of the film is so disturbing that at times it gives you the queasy feeling that you might get from watching ""Night of the Living Dead"" - even worse knowing this films backdrop is based on reality.  The violence is savage and sadistic but really occurred during this period of Simba uprising in the Congo.

The basic script seems to concern a mission by train to save a colony of Europeans in the Congo but in reality this is flimsy excuse for the retrieval of 50 million dollars of diamonds. Almost everything seems to go wrong that can go wrong on the mission. The mission's crew is attacked by the UN forces, they fight among themselves, they are overtaken by Simbas, they loose a train car of colonists, train tracks are bombed out, they run out of gas - etc.  Although the plot is fiction the story takes place during a real time of revolution, bloodshed, war, mercenaries, ruthless mobs, mass murder, sickening torture and extreme violence in the Congo.  The action is almost none stop.  According to the director/photographer Jack Cardiff - The violence and torture were actually toned down in the film when compared to the real sickening acts that took place during the Simba rebellion.

All the actors are believable and very good including the two major stars Rod Taylor and Jim Brown.  Kenneth More was also quite good as an alcoholic paid-for-hire medic working for booze. Few of these characters are your classic heroes; the majority are amoral, ruthless mercenaries who are not so much interested in saving lives as they are in earning a buck or a good case of scotch. One vicious but talented commanding officer named Henlein (powerfully played by Peter Carsten) proudly wears a Nazi medal and unflinchingly kills children.

Jim Brown's character Ruffo is the most moral of the lot, as he shows patriotic motivations, but even Ruffo shows no expression as he calmly walks through a horrifying scene of innocent men, women and even nuns being burned alive, raped, and brutally tortured (arguably the most disturbing scene in the film) in order to retrieve a cache of diamonds. There is not a mention from him to do anything that might help these poor souls. These are not noble characters - the audience is only forced to root for them because they are far superior to the alternatives shown in the film.

The violent final show-down must have sounded ridiculous on paper but works incredibly well in the film. Picture a half-crazed mad-man in a jeep perusing a terrified white water rafter in the jungle. This is followed by a brutal fist fight that changes location from river, to cliffs, to water falls, to hanging vines and to more rapids - like Tarzan on diesel fuel, speed and steroids.  Complete with one of the ugliest filmed death scenes on record up to the date this film was made - complete with snapping bones and a gutting.  I cant say the guy didn't deserve it though.

The film has the expensive looking production values - including photography, editing, locations and music equivalent to that of a top 60s James Bond film. Now unfortunately this film can only be had on DVD as one Warner Bros DVD-R stock which I find to be hit or miss quality.  This one is almost a miss but still watchable.  The film Warner Bros provided here does not appear to be from the original negative or a pristine print.  It is far from high-def and could use a cleaning.  The colors look way over saturated and the contrast seems too high as if someone had shaded the film in with thick dark crayons. You can get allot of improvement by turning the contrast and color down on your TV.  The sound is mono and clear but the entire print really deserves Criterion-like BluRay treatment and a bit of a tweak on the sound.  There are lots of explosions and gun fire in this film that come off as a bit flat when they should rock the walls.

I would give this film a 5 star rating for an ""action adventure film"" - it has a very good script, music, suspense, locations, performances and very gritty ahead-of-its-time violent action. I take away a star for the lackluster DVD offering.  On a positive note - I do not believe that anything has been cut from the print as the violence in the film is graphic and relentless.

Note - As a companion piece to the movie, I would highly recommend the book Congo Mercenary by Mike Hoare. The book is an excellent biographic account of the Mercenary's role in the Simba uprising in the Congo. The book compliments the movie well.",1313625600,5,4686,4.593525179856115
554375,3,630309192X,"I came to this movie after reading Stephen Vagg's recent biography entitled ROD TAYLOR: AN AUSSIE IN HOLLYWOOD. (My review of this terrific book is also here on Amazon.) Mr. Vagg wrote so glowingly about the film - and despite my being a Rod Taylor fan I had somehow missed seeing this.  So I ordered the new Warner Brothers DVD release of it - a ""Remastered Edition.""  Unfortunately, as with so many other WB releases, there are no chapter stops, no extras, no commentaries, no audio options.  While the image is in letterbox format and the images vibrantly clear and the audio excellent - it is obvious that this is a butchered version of what was originally a very much more violent film.  I thought that ""Remastered Edition"" was somewhat equivalent to a ""Restored Edition.""  No such luck. And I hate it when scenes are censored and cut out! What true film lover doesn't?  Especially a film such as this which has attained a ""cult status.""

I never saw the complete film.  But based on quotations in the Vagg bio from Quentin Tarantino - who absolutely loves this movie - mention is made of at least one scene missing from this DVD release - and that is ""the hacking deaths, the feeding of nuns to alligators"" according to QT.  Having just watched the film, there are brief scenes of nuns being caught in the clutches of the bad guys - but no direct scene containing alligators as alluded to by QT.  Ergo, my guess is that this ""Remastered Edition"" has, itself, been ""hacked to death.""  SPOILER ALERT:  Even the finish of the fierce, finish fight between Taylor and actor Peter Carsten's s.o.b. (the Swastika-wearing bad-guy) seems to have several yards of frames missing.  Again, I have not seen the film in its entirety - but it seems to me that what Taylor really does to Carsten is far worse than what we are shown.  Indeed, he most probably does what the Jim Brown character earlier in the film says his people used to do to their enemies in order to gain their courage and intelligence.  I'm sure you get my drift.

So - having just seen the film for the first time - it is definitely a terrific film with several magnificent set pieces.  The action scenes - despite obvious cuts - are powerful.  Cinematography is top-shelf.  The music score is perfect, even if somewhat imitative of Ennio Morricone - but then again, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Jack Cardiff's direction shows the signs of a true artist. Rod Taylor, Jim Brown, Kenneth More, Peter Carsten, Yvette Mimieux (despite a small part with a love scene twixt her and Taylor ending up on the cutting room floor) all fit their parts perfectly.  According to Rod Taylor as quoted in Vagg's fabulous biography of the actor, Taylor was offered to test for the part of James Bond by ""Cubby"" Broccoli well before Sean Connery stepped into 007's shoes and slept in his many beds.  When I had first read this I quite honestly couldn't picture Rod Taylor in the part.  But having just seen DARK OF THE SUN I have revised my opinion.  He would have been sensational as Bond!  He is tough and fierce and in other scenes of the film very touching and also very humorous.  He was truly - as QT and Stephen Vagg in his bio assert - the Russell Crowe of his day, both actors being Aussies.  And Crowe himself would have been a beautifully brutal and brilliant Bond.

SPOILER ALERT again:  I must admit that the ending of this film somewhat disappointed me.  According to the Vagg bio, Taylor himself devised the ending as shown in the film.  In the original, Taylor's character goes off into the sunset with his Weena-from-the-Past.  In the finished film he allows himself to be put under arrest for killing the badass.  As I say, I was disappointed in the conclusion.  However - I daresay that if the final fight had NOT been toned-down as to its violence and HAD the Taylor character done to Carsten's character what I think he MUST have done...then the ending makes much more sense and instead of being somewhat of a letdown, would and should have been as bold and brave as it undoubtedly actually was.  But this is really only possible, I think, if the brutality of the finish-fight had remained as brutal, as animalistic, as it apparently once actually was.

Someone in their own review likens this film to Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS and the similarity is very much there.  Instead of a boat, there is a train, etc.  But ""The horror, the horror"" of Conrad's novel and its eventual filmic incarnation as APOCALYPSE NOW in likewise at the heart of this film.  But it is a pity that having the film finally out on DVD, it is NOT the full film.  What there is of it is, in the words of Quentin Tarantino, ""an immense film.""  What a damn shame, though, that that immensity was compromised by a curtailed cut of a most unique film experience.  Still-and-all, this is one helluva movie!",1313107200,47,4854,4.578215527230591

554511,5,630309192X,"From Wilbur Smith's classic story of uprising and strife in the Belgian Congo, ""Last Train from Katanga"", this movie is as dark as the title implies.  No doubt, Mr. Smith had some heartache over Adrian Spies' screenplay - a script that was truly one of the first up-and-coming forms of political correctness (very different from the book).  Jack Cardiff provides a spectacular vista to the warfare that most people find repugnant and would like to ignore - the war of the soldiers of fortune.  Rod Taylor and Jim Brown provide a wonderful sounding board for the politics behind their endeavor - Brown was just making his move from a brilliant football career to acting - and it shows (a flag on the play!). Fresh from ""The Dirty Dozen"", Brown - who portrays Sgt. ""Ruffo"" - improved considerably as his acting career progressed.  Yvette Mimieux is a welcome relief as the beautiful eye-candy in a world of stark carnage and suffering.  Kenneth More provides his gift of refined British appeal as the troubled Dr. Wreid.  Peter Carsten plays the hardened career soldier who takes Taylor's character, Bruce Curry, to task.

Leading a train into the heart of the Congo, Captain Bruce Curry and his band of mercenaries seek to rescue the inhabitants of an isolated village surrounded by rebel Simbas - oh, and a cache of diamonds secured in their vault. This theme is supported by the eerie tempo of the great soundtrack by Jacques Loussier and the wonderful cinema vistas that one would expect from Jack Cardiff.  One of my personal favorites, this is probably not for anyone who isn't weened off of Disney!  Currently, this is only available on VHS tape.  It would really shine on DVD.

554512,4,630309192X,"Although at first glance, Dark of the Sun (1968, starring Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, & football star Jim Brown)seems to be your typical fiction book made into film, it is, in fact, a very realistic portrayal of similar events which ocurred during the Katanga rebellion in 1964 in the newly created Republic of the Congo. It was about diamonds, it was about a proxy war between the East and the West, and Jim Brown's acting, although a bit stiff at times, actually comes off quite well. Rod Taylor was a veteran actor by this time, and it shows clear through as he takes on the portrayal of the tough and hardened, veteran mercenary soldier.
The Simbas DID eat their victims, they did kill hundreds of foreigners (mostly Belgian). The only thing that is not portrayed in the movie is the fact that the Simbas actually used some French mercenaries on their side (although very few), but this historically unknown bit of data is OK to be missing from the movie, since it would only confuse the viewer.
I am sorry to say that I paid $40 for my VHS copy and that the movie's gory scenes were completely deleted - but that is because the producer of the 1994 video (MGM) wanted to sell this movie to as wide an audience as possible.
Perhaps in the future someone in the movie industry will decide to release this film (1) in its entirety as it deserves and (2) on DVD. I for one would be in line to buy a copy or two!

In July 1964, after four years of uneasy Independence, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was engulfed by an armed rebellion which spread through the country with the speed and ferocity of a bush fire. The 'Simbas' - the rebel soldiers - doped with heroin, proceeded to strike terror into the hearts of civilians and National Army alike, raping, looting and burning. Faced with this situation, Moise Tshombe enlisted the aid of Colonel Mike Hoare and his white Mercenary soldiers. He and his men took Stanleyville and helped save most of the white population. It is therefore Mike Hoare's saving of these people in Stanleyville that the book by Wilbur Smith and the film is based on. P.S. I notest that Amazon have a book, Congo Mercenary (Paperback)

by Mike Hoare, in stock. If it is the same book I have, it's worth reading. Gus",1136764800,7,980,4.664739884393064
554514,5,630309192X,"A Congo mercenary is hired with a double goal: to rescue a group of citizens in a besieged twon and bring back some valuable diamonds with ulterior proposals.

There are several highlights worthy to mention; the action sequence on the train, is filled of histamine: The ominous presence of the hated officer (superbly played by Peter Carsten) who still carries the Nazi symbol will radicalize the conflict and will originate crucial dialogues along the train journey, the first one concerns with the inquiring answer of Jim Brown about the final destiny of Congo and the other is the extraordinary fighting between the Nazi officer and Taylor: the anger displayed for Taylor have been one of the top rage expressions in years. Ad all we know the mission will be unfinished without the expected conflict between these two wills.

After a long sequence of explosions and murderers, there will be a passionate bet of Brown trusting in Taylor words, when the gas jeep is over and the rest of the group must remain in the middle of the jungle waiting for the promised rescue once Rod arrives to the final destiny.

Jim Cardiff made an entertained and vibrant picture without major pretensions but leaving opened doors to a further discussion, the honor sense believe or not will be present in Taylor's soul, that eventually will become his particular redemption in the modern times: A War Council.

554515,5,630309192X,"Being a huge fan of this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing Bruce Willis' TEARS OF THE SUN as it seemed to be inspired by this Sixties classic. Well, that was a disappointment. First off, you've GOT to have MERCENARIES. There obviously are not enough good Merc movies being made. TEARS is a decent film, but for various reasons is not as engaging as DARK OF THE SUN. In the small, exclusive realm of Merc movies, DARK OF THE SUN (and THE WILD GEESE) remains the best. As has been noted, this is not entirely politically correct, but it is more PC than the book and it suffers some from this. Still, I think it is the best we can get out of Hollywood.

For instance, the worst guy in the movie is a white racist. My only major criticism of the film comes out of his demise, when he deserves what he gets but the film takes a holier than thou approach against Rod Taylor. So there's a bit of a let down after their climactic and extremely savage showdown.

On the plus side, Rod gets to reteam with his Time Machine co-star Yvette Mimeux. If you read the book by Wilbur Smith, she's a pretty good fit for the character. The soundtrack is fantastic; I'm currently debating paying $35 for an original album, and if its still around next time I look I'll probably go for it. Rod Taylor is in his prime and nobody does tough SOB like him. The tension when he is trying to evacuate the town will put you in a cold sweat and the horrific loss of part of the fleeing train remained surprisingly true to the brutality described in the book. I join the chorus of getting this movie to DVD, like many others of Rod Taylor's Sixties films. If you like pulp Men's Action/Adventure put to screen, you should enjoy this.",1111104000,15,1715,4.3229813664596275
554516,4,630309192X,"First saw this flick when I was a high schl student & was simply fascinated by it.  Jim Brown's football was much better than his acting though.

  For a film based on the Simba revolt in the mid-60s in the Congo it is pretty good.  It captures the violence of the Simbas as well the cynicizm of the mercs fighting for diamonds.

  For a true read on events, look up the life of Paul Carlson, a U.S. missionary Dr., killed by the Simbas in the revolt just as the paras were arrivning on the scene to save people in Elizabethville.

  The real leaders of the Simba revolt, except for L. Kabila, were for the most part killed in a gun battle in an Euro bar about a yr. after the revolt.

  The flick opens with a kid hosing down some Simbas that had raped & killed his mother as well as other westeners when the Mercs arrived & saved him.  Brutal stuff, but so was the Simba Revolt.

  Good movie for war buffs.  Actually, every two months it plays on Bulgarian TV currently on the TMC channel, believe-it-or-not!  Worth seeing especially if you're interested in Africa.",1104710400,5,1068,4.3520408163265305
554517,4,630309192X,"I'm so glad I picked this film up when it was still at a reasonable
price tag. I'm still waiting to see the ""uncut"" dvd version of this
  The story deals with the mission of two mercenaries
(Rod Talyor & Jim Brown) are sent into the wilds of Africa during
 Congo war uprising. Thier main task is to rescue any & all persons
 still in the perimeter of the Simba tribes but underneath the task
 is that of a hidden agenda of bringing back a wealth in diamonds.
Said to be in part policitly and Racially incorrect I simply saw
it as a supremely done ""british action film"" with enough intense
moments to keep most planted to their seats. This is an extremely
downbeat film even amongest all the explosions & chainsaw fights
from the title credits on in,this film takes you on a journey of
impending doom where everything that can go wrong does. This vhs
version in fact has a few scenes missing maybe due to violence or
some other factor. This is definetly one of Taylor's more intense
roles,I don't think I've ever seen him more furious in his career
There becomes a strained partnership between him and Jim Brown as
the mission becomes one of personal and financial gain. This mgm
series also has the original trailer following the film is always
a big plus in my book.",1079049600,4,1267,4.443965517241379
554518,4,630309192X,"Dated. Politically Incorrect. Downright Racist at times. The movie runs like a poor man's ""Heart of Darkness."" Forget politics, history, or economics! The Simbas are simply reverting to old tribal ways. (Whereas Ruffo (Jim Brown) is a ""good, civilized"" african, whose father was approprately ashamed of his filed teeth.) This is the level of political awareness the film presents. Good Grief. Mobutu is supposed to be the good guy!
 Stereotypes prevail. The Simbas wear warpaint and brandish spears. Yvette Mimeux plays the white, virgin; who narrowly escapes ""violation."" The only camoflage is the Hennerlin (sp?), the Nazi played by Peter Carsten, who exists only to prove that whites can be ""primitive"" too. Yeah, the story was written by a white South African alright and all in all the characters are two-dimensional.
Having said all that. Why four stars? the story has the ring of truth about it. Unlike most action movies, everything that can go wrong *does* from pure, understandable circumstance--and not from the *stupidity* of the major characters, summoned to move the plot along. The ending *is* tragic. (The only part of the mission that ""comes off"" is that the diamonds apparently get back to their ""rightful owners."")
Finally, there's the speech Curry (Taylor) gives to Ruffo over Reid lifeless body. ""The gun's Chinese, Ruffo, paid for by russian rubles. The steel probably came from a West German factory, built with French francs. Then it was flown here on an african airline, *probably* subsidized by the Yew-nited States! I don't think he got very far!""
It's shaped my entire view of foreign policy, ever since.",1002067200,2,1632,5.135338345864661
