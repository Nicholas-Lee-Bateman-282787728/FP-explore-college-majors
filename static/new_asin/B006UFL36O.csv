8504519,3,B006UFL36O,"I was worried about purchasing this DVD from the U.K. because of the regional limitations that most U.S. DVD players have and I was right. It was not compatible with my Sony DVD player. I was irritated because under the product details/description it stated that this DVD would work in all regions... But it didn't. It would've been nice if there was some type of clarification. So, I did all kinds of research and found out that some DVD's can be hacked (by changing the regional settings) and others can't... Unfortunately, I owned the one can't be hacked.. Just my luck! I tried it out on my mac book pro and it wouldn't work on there... and last but not least, I tried it on my ACER PC and it worked great! After that minor little mishap... I was pretty pissed... But.. Onto the actual review...

This is a good pole dancing instructional DVD. There were some tricks in the advanced section I haven't seen done before that I am pretty interested in learning... In addition to the female instructor, there is a male instructor as well, he offers a bit of diversity. His style is more of chinese pole dancing.. While the female instructor is more of a traditional pole dancer. She executes each trick in a very lax manner and makes it look rather simple and easy.. Her explanations however, are confusing.. I rely solely on visual... And I like that she doesn't do much talking.

This DVD came faster than the estimated shipping date. I wasn't supposed to get it until July 20 something but it ended up coming July 8th.",1341705600,,1521,4.547445255474453

Also, the routines are an excellent addition for those of us who are not inclined to create our own. I highly recommend getting the set if you don't already own them. I have several different pole fitness dvd's and the Lucy Misch Pole Exercise dvd's are by far the best.  A wonderful way to stay fit, feel good and enjoy the process.",1327795200,4,489,4.373626373626373
