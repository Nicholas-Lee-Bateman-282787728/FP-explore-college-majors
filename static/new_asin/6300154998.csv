It immortalized the graffiti on the wooden fence on Fountain Ave that said Wall Writers Stink!  That graffiti was on the fence there for years.  Love that and so many other things.  What a great time capsule from a really great time in Hollywood.",1435190400,,385,4.219178082191781
8324385,5,6300154998,"First of all, the movie is not about Joan Jett, and why should it be - see the title. It's a great movie that is absolutely not for everyone. But if you're ready to open your mind for something unusual, you'll enjoy it. It's wild, strange, violent, crazy, messy at times - but well, it's a punk movie, after all. It has great music, it is incredibly fast, it is like a roller coaster. Ray Sharkey is great in it, it's probably one of his best roles, he is insanely charming and energetic, totally captivating.",1281312000,,509,4.368421052631579
