8002835,3,B0000TSRCY,Roschmann and of course Barenboim make this dvd worth owning.....all cast is good but these were the standouts for me,1386547200,,117,4.9
8002836,5,B0000TSRCY,"For: Cosi Fan Tutte (2002)
Studio: TDK DVD Video
DVD Release Date: December 2, 2003

Language: Italian (Not English! LOL)

I almost didn't buy this Daniel Barenboim version of Mozart's  ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" because it is listed here on Amazon that the language is English.

I thought to myself: What - a ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" in English - are you kidding me! LOL  Well, taking a chance, I purchased it anyway, in hopes that it would actually be in Italian.

I am very happy and pleased to say that Daniel Barenboim's version of Mozart's  ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" is, in fact, in Italian.

I absolutely enjoyed this Daniel Barenboim version.  I would think that Mozart would be exceptionally proud of this unusual and amusing production of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"".",1347753600,,739,4.7109375
8002837,3,B0000TSRCY,"Musically, this production was fine.  But I disagree with the fans who liked the look and updating.  I found it visually unappealing, and dramatically uninteresting.  Some design elements are colorful and eye-catching, but most just look cheap, flimsy, and unattractive.  The cast often seemed lost for direction.  Many updated productions work well, but this one strains itself to the breaking point to find some 1960s analog for every possible element, even when something traditional would work fine (or better).  By way of example, instead of giving Dorabella his portrait, Ferrando writes an ""F"" in magic marker on her bra.  Later, instead of a locket, she gets a big plastic heart pendant with a flashing light inside.

If this DVD seems interesting, I'd suggest renting it, not buying.  It's more of a one-off novelty production than something of enduring interest.",1298419200,7,872,5.215827338129497
8002838,5,B0000TSRCY,"This is, almost certainly, my favorite opera ever written, and I can't imagine it being a better treatment than it is given by Doris Dorrie in this beautiful production. The singers are uniformly excellent -- Roschmann is the clear standout, and her ""Come scoglio"" is probably the best I've heard. Kammerloher's deadpan delivery is the scene-stealer, though, and it makes the duet ""Il core vi dono"" surprisingly touching when she finally gives in and shows some warmth. You could do a lot worse than Werner Gura for sheer beauty, particularly in ""Un'aura amorosa,"" maybe the most deceptively difficult Mozart tenor aria. Daniela Bruera and Hanno Muller-Brachmann are both lively and charismatic. Roman Trekel's stiffness and strangely effortful singing can be a bit of a distraction, but he's always devilishly engaged. My only major complaint with this DVD are Barenboim's choice of tempi; almost every one is conspicuously too slow, making him seem strangely out of step with the production, which chugs along quite nicely. Dorrie, who apparently was an opera ignoramous before this production, gives us a completely relatable and perfectly adapted take on a classic -- as someone who works in the opera industry, it's such a relief to see a fresh mind at work among so much jaded bitterness.",1185408000,9,1294,5.137440758293839
8002839,5,B0000TSRCY,"Of the various versions on DVD - - this one is the most compelling - - it is simply delightful.  A modern staging - yes, but such superb performances from all the participants.  You will treasure this.",1184025600,4,201,4.405405405405405
8002840,4,B0000TSRCY,"Most attempts to update operas that were originially set in previous eras fall short, but this production's flower child update to the 1960's works, mostly because the producers made the quality of the performers a top priority, starting with the beautiful lyric soprano voice of Dorothea Roschmann as Fiordiligi. To the high quality of the singing throughout, add hippies romping around in colorful and creative get-ups and the players climbing out of the orchestra pit as if it's a swimming pool, and this production becomes an ideal way to introduce younger people to some of the most heavenly music in all of opera.",1145145600,6,619,5.019417475728155
8002841,4,B0000TSRCY,"This DVD is my absolute favorite of the Cosi DVDs I've seen (including Gardiner's).  Roschmann is a truly enthralling Fiordiligi and I absolutely love the characterization that Kammerloher gives Dorabella.  The other principals are all fantastic as well.  What I think gives this performance the edge is the constumes, sets, and staging.  It's a wonderful, colorful performance, packed with so much action....there's no moment where a performer is just standing still onstage belting out a number - there's an endless stream of action.  The ACT I Sextet, for example, is absolutely hysterical because of all the action involving Dorabella's and Fiordiligi's reaction to Ferrando and Guglielmo in disguise.  It's like that throughout the performance.  While listening to the fantastic music (and performances) we have so much to look at (and laugh at) in this performance.  It highlights the comedy (and drama) in this great work more than any other performance I've seen (on stage or on DVD).  I just went to the San Francisco Opera's ""Cosi fan tutte"" premiere this past weekend....and despite the great performance (Flicka was awesome), I was left wishing this version had been staged.  It is truly wonderful.  I cannot recommend it enough.",1095033600,23,1241,5.248730964467005
8002842,4,B0000TSRCY,"the cast are beautiful, the set are colorful, and the actions are funny - just the conducting...oh Daniel is getting older and slower...until second act.  The best DVD is still the John Elliot Gardiner's but this is second best...better then Cecillia Bartolli's serious Fiordigili and odd conducting of Nicolas Hanoncourt.
Buy this one!",1072310400,12,336,5.339622641509434
