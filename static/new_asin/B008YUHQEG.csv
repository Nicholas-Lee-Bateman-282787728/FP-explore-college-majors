5192187,4,B008YUHQEG,"I've read somewhere that the ""perfect"" relationship is one where each person thinks as much about the other person and their concerns and feelings, as they do about their own. It's a tricky business when the light of a possible new and great relationship comes up unexpectedly, in the midst of major issues facing each partner.

In this well acted drama, both men find something new and potentially wonderful in the development of their relationship. The subject of the film concerns how they work out their relationship and deal with issues they came into the relationship with.

Both actors give fine performances that ring true, and the development of the characters throughout the film is a realistic portrayal how couples learn to be more open after significant losses in their lives have shut them down, for a period of time.

The drama that they create to deal with their losses is probably necessary for their resolution. Catharsis is usually important in dealing with all the pent up feelings that major losses involve and  coming out the other side intact.  The film does a nice job of dealing with all these issues and it would be easy to see, when things settle down, that these two men would have a relationship for many years to come.",1358985600,8,1248,4.786046511627907
5192188,4,B008YUHQEG,"Morgan Oliver is recently paraplegic, T-10 incomplete, as a result of a bicycle accident during a race he was competing in.  He has recently returned home from rehab and he's now unemployed and living on disability, adjusting to his new life and the new adaptive setup in his apartment.  His preferred way to pass the time is drinking beer and watching television, and the main events of the film begin when he runs out of beer and neither his mother, Peg, nor his best friend, Lane, will enable him any further.  They refuse to buy him more beer, forcing him to leave the house on his own.  It is during his trip out to replenish his beer supplies that he meets Dean Kagen, which is where our romance begins.

The drama unfolds once Morgan decides he wants to compete in the wheelchair division of the very same race that cost him his ability to walk, where Morgan, because of his hyper-competitive nature, caused an accident involving himself and two other competitors on a very dangerous part of the course.  This same hyper-competitive nature leads to his doing things he ought not to be doing and refusing to listen to reason from Dean, his doctor, or anyone else.

This film is a journey for Morgan where he must confront his past and his present, and he must find a way to learn from his mistakes and move forward.  This is also, to a lesser extent, a journey for Dean in finding a new way to live following the death of his mother.  But most of all, it is a romance featuring a paraplegic romantic lead, which is something that is very rare to find.  And better yet, it is a romance that delves into the issue of disabled sexuality, which we almost never see on film.  And Morgan is pretty cute, too, so that helps.

This is a male/male romance, but it is not a coming out story; rather, the central focus of the story is Morgan's disability.  The film addresses both the disability and the romance from a variety of angles and is, I think, one of the most comprehensive films I've seen with regard to disability and romance.  It's a low budget film with acting that could be better, but the writing/directing/production team of Michael Akers and Sandon Berg, as well as Leo Minaya, who played the title character, Morgan, did quite a lot of research in preparation for this film (though there are certainly some important gaps).  Leo MInaya is not paraplegic himself, and this was a deliberate casting decision on behalf of the filmmakers because the film originally was going to contain scenes of Morgan before his accident which ended up being cut from the final version of the film.  I think that things like Photoshop and body doubles could get around the reasons they cited for hiring a non-disabled actor instead of a disabled one, but the actor they cast was very dedicated to portraying the reality of Morgan's paralysis.  There was a scene early on in the film where Dean helps Morgan with his leg exercises, and the director had instructed Leo MInaya to keep his leg up during the scene after Dean let go of it, and Mr. Minaya insisted that this would be impossible for Morgan to do and he made sure that the film reflected this.  There was another particular scene that was very physically intense, and in the commentary, the filmmakers point out multiple times that Leo Minaya refused to use his legs to help him with this very difficult scene, insisting on pulling himself back up and over the wall using only his arms.  A lot of actors, particularly in low budget indie films, might not have this kind of dedication to the role they were playing, and so although I think a paraplegic actor would have been preferable, Leo MInaya did a great job of being Morgan.  Leo Minaya and Jack Kesy are not gay in real life, either, but they managed to do a great job with that aspect of their roles, as well.

Overall, I would recommend this film.  The characters are well-rounded and authentic, and there's more to Morgan's life than his disability.  Morgan and Dean's relationship doesn't shy away from the issues of Morgan's disability, but it's much more than that, as well.  And Morgan can't get it up without a little blue pill, which shows that the filmmakers listened to the guys they talked to about paraplegic sexuality and erectile dysfunction.  It isn't perfect, and I really wish they had used a paraplegic actor, but it is much more than we usually see, and in general, it is a good, complex film that tackles the issues that matter.  I've seen it three times now and it actually gets better each time I watch it as I notice more nuance and detail within the story.",1358553600,21,4592,4.569512195121951
5192189,5,B008YUHQEG,I'd ordered the movie before and decided to get a copy. I wasn't dissapointed. It was not expensive either. That certainly didn't hurt.,1357776000,2,135,4.913043478260869
5192190,4,B008YUHQEG,"This film is very touching and at the same time seems realistic and real. It is a believable same-sex romance and one cares about the two main characters and their relationship. Both male leads, Leo Minaya and Jack Kesy,  do a great job. At least one of them is straight, but both capture being a gay man in an on-spot perfect way, masculine but not straight-acting, butch but tender. One also does a superb job of "" becoming "" someone in a wheelchair including lots of challenging outdoor racing scenes and less-than-glamorous details. The writing and directing are good; some of the supporting cast tend to over-act a bit. The guys behind this film have made several other good films. It is refreshing to see a film about a disabled gay man and one where the disabled person is very human, not a perfect angel or a misfit either. Surprisingly frank discussions and visuals of the day-to-day difficulties of being in a wheelchair, the physical therapy and medical help needed,the issue of sexual abilities, and coming to realize someone can love you even if you are "" flawed "" ( like everyone else ). Especially good for gay men as there is such an emphasis on being "" hot "" in the community. The music is excellent, especially the songs by Nicholas Wells.",1357516800,4,1257,4.63677130044843

5192198,3,B008YUHQEG,"I enjoyed this movie very much and especially appreciated the filmmakers staying clear of depicting the characters as victims so popular in gay-themed stories. It's a love story about two masculine men, one with a handicap who has a dream to one day racing again, only this time in a wheelchair race, and the other coping with the guilt of losing his mother to cancer. I'm only giving it three stars because of the ending which left me extremely frustrated. WARNING! SPOILER AHEAD: I really really wanted Morgan to enter the wheelchair race. I know that budget restraints kept the filmmakers from shooting large crowd scenes, but I really really wanted him to race. I wouldn't have cared if he lost, but only that he was able to face his demons and give it a try.",1452038400,,763,4.617647058823529

5192202,2,B008YUHQEG,"I am on a movie binge weekend and most of my binging has been ""foreign gay romances.""  I was running out of foreign films and grabbed this one despite its 2 star Netflix rating.

I won't restate the plot,  but the lead actor is adorable.  The problem is that the acting was really bad,  and the dialog wasn't natural.  None of the actors sounded authentic at all.  It wasn't like they were having to reach deep or show conflicting motivations -  it was pretty basic stuff.  Fighting with his mom,  fighting with his boyfriend,  etc.

The story was probably cute,  but was a little trite,  and the mediocre acting really didn't help.

I was surprised to see it rated so well over here,  as the Netflix rating seemed about right.",1439596800,,727,4.476923076923077

5192213,5,B008YUHQEG,"I am so very happy that this movie isn't an overly stereotypical gay one (nor has any overly stereotypical gay characters in it). It's not about hedonism or trampiness.....but about Morgan's path in life. This man was crippled from an accident and deals with some inner demons from that. He goes through some hard times, pushing people away, and in spite of this hardship, he grows and strengthens himself. It's really sweet, too, that his love finds him and loves him regardless of his disability. They fall in love not because some community tells them to, but because they are meant for each other.

5192215,4,B008YUHQEG,"I live in NYC and i work near where this film takes place and i have to say, Morgan feels authentic to me.  Both actors represent their roles well and left me cheering for a happy resolve.  I like how this film addresses the issue of disabilities, shining the spot light on the fact that it is not always easy to adjust to a new reality.  Morgan's best friend is hilarious and it very believable as a character (my BFFF is the same too!)

The romance story is sweet too and for those of you that are looking for a HEA - with this film, you'll get it.

I also recommend:

Yossi and of course its prequel, Yossi and Jagger",1389398400,,620,4.125

5192218,5,B008YUHQEG,"I absolutely love this movie.  I've watched it four times, and would definitely watch it again.  Morgan is a recent paraplegic, injured in a bike marathon accident.  He wallows in self-pity until...by chance...he meets Dean while wheel-chairing past a park basketball court.  Watching the love story unfold is a treat, and watching Morgan's struggle with his new disability and the ultimate triumph of love over that disability will leave you with a warm heart and hope for the future.",1385510400,,485,5.10126582278481
5192219,3,B008YUHQEG,"""Morgan"" starts off showing the budding romance between Morgan (Leo Minaya) and Dean (Jack Kesy)that is challenged by Morgan's confinement to a wheelchair due to a recent biking accident. Morgan is content to drink beer and live off disability while his understanding but annoying Mother (Madalyn McKay)offers whatever support is needed. Morgan and Dean's relationship proceeds nicely, if a little quickly, until Morgan decides to enter the race that crippled him the previous year (In a specially fitted bike). As Morgan trains and gets physically stronger, he becomes emotionally embittered and pushes everyone, including Dean, away. Finally, Morgan realizes he can't do it all and reconciles with an understanding Dean and a forgiving Mother. It's the predictable ending that tarnishes this engaging effort. Minaya and Kesy(who resembles a young Ryan Lochte)have great chemistry and their romance is sweet and loving. Both give fine performances, but the script lets them down. So ""Morgan"" is worth a look, but give ""Latter Days"" and ""Mulligans"" a look before this one.",1383436800,,1072,5.425149700598802

5192222,4,B008YUHQEG,"I liked it. The set up was good. Some parts seemed to be a bit over acted, but for an hour and a half movie, I think it was what was needed to tell the story and keep things on pace. I liked how the scene at the end was played out. It worked.",1379721600,,242,3.5

It is a difficult road and this movie presents one possible scenario for what might happen. The acting isn't great, the writing is just mediocre , but on the whole it actually adds to the film.

5192226,3,B008YUHQEG,"For certain, 'Morgan' is one of the most unique love stories I have ever viewed. A slightly slow start, the film quickly moves forward, and soon, our lead character Morgan meets Dean at the basketball court.  A quirky but cute first date arrives, and soon a genuine and rare story unfolds.  Love not based on sex or status, but on two people who desire the deepest of emotions to connect.  With only 90 minutes from start to finish, we really cannot fully analyze the connection, but suffice to say, it seems real.  Soon, your emotions are tugged, as the two experience 'flying on a cloud' and 'butterflies' as their relationship develops.  Their performances are strong and believable.

The only other key actors are the best friend and Morgan's mother - neither of which are particularly grand, but at least the friend breaks up the somewhat serious aspect of the film.  I have to admit, I found it hard to believe this character playing Morgan's Mother could have really been related!  But, the focus on Morgan and Dean was key, so I could tend to overlook it.

Unfortunately (as another review points out), the second half starts to derail. While I'm OK with a bit of derailment, unfortunately, it goes way too far.  Our lead Morgan rapidly goes from a kind-hearted sweet (and challenged man) to a very stubborn (even hateful) guy.  But in a flash, emotions pour out, and he quickly makes amends with his mother, best friend, and Dean.  All the build up of the first half is unfortunately lost in this dismal effort at (I assume) adding dramatic effect?  As the film comes to a close, the Brady Bunch-esque finish no longer captures or tugs at my heart strings.

What was a solid 4-star film (often 5-stars) erodes with this uncharacteristic change of events.  I completely lost my connection with the main character, and the ending almost became predictable.  Would I recommend it? Yes, but with hesitation.  The storyline is unique, and the love story (as it starts and develops) is refreshing.  But the second half falters and many a viewer will disconnect or at least find it predictable and/or annoying.  Overall, it's an excellent effort for an independent production, but the attempt to mimic typical mainstream gay stories diminishes an otherwise great work.",1376092800,,2270,4.83419689119171

5192229,4,B008YUHQEG,"So far, Morgan is the most exquisitely complex character created by director Akers. In this movie, the gay subject is placed on the back burner to let the audience explore the angst and frustration of a man (surprisingly well performed by Leo Minaya) addicted to compete and to win who is now forced, like it or not, to recognize and accept the limitations that destiny has imposed in his life. Hats down to Michael Akers. Can hardly wait for his next movie. He stole my heart with Gone But Not Forgotten and he is getting better ever since.",1375401600,,541,4.530612244897959

5192235,3,B008YUHQEG,"The first half of this movie is very good, refreshingly low-key and original, with a believable, slowly-developing romance between Morgan and Dean in Inwood, the far northern tip of Manhattan almost never seen in movies. The relaxed, small-town, almost rural character of the place is a welcome change from the frantic pace, hard-edged greed and shallow posturing that dominate in the more fashionable areas downtown where most movies are made. The city used to have many such low-key neighborhoods that we never see in movies, so it's good to see this one while it still exists.

Unfortunately, the movie sort of disintegrates in its second half. Producers Akers and Berg must have thought a simple love story would be too boring, so they shoehorned a boatload of dramatic tension into the gentle, lovely story and ruined it. There are no gay-beating thugs, which is the stock drama-injector in gay movies, and its absence here is a great relief; but the absurd and highly annoying behavior of the main character is even more infuriating in a different, if much less hackneyed, way.

A consistent delight throughout the movie, though, is Jack Kesy's gentle but powerful performance as Dean. He is unfailingly marvelous... so good that he makes the movie worth watching despite its significant flaws and Leo Minaya's much more heavy-handed and less believable performance as Morgan.",1368921600,12,1382,5.110619469026549

He meets a young man named Dean (Jack Kesy) who lost his father and then put his life on hold to care for his mother who recently passed away after suffering with cancer. Can this young man offer Morgan the love he desires so deeply?

Unlike many other indie films that are fraught with stale jokes, old cliches, and nauseating stereotypes, this movie is a triumph of the human spirit, a testament to true and unconditional love, and comfort food for the heart and soul.

8532761,1,B008YUHQEG,Amateurish acting.  Awful music.  There was nothing likeable about this movie.  More like a first film project than anything else.,1526515200,,130,5.4
8532762,5,B008YUHQEG,"Great movie. Not your typical substandard gay flick. Decent acting,very good story line.",1525132800,,88,5.846153846153846
8532763,4,B008YUHQEG,The best gay move I've seen so far! It had a very good storyline. It was very endearing and I like how it was also about the struggles of being in a wheelchair and not just the struggles of being gay. The movie really touched on two very important topics,1524873600,,254,4.1
8532764,5,B008YUHQEG,"Excellent plot, very good pace, decent twists, definitely a good set up for another movie.",1524614400,,90,5.066666666666666

8532766,4,B008YUHQEG,"You can count on one hand the number of movies that have dealt with disabled recovery struggles; a movie about gay disabled struggles HAS NEVER been done. That alone deserves applause.  The main actors give excellent performances.  The writing and support characters are less that steller and much of the dialog is forced.  I doubt the writer or director is disabled and the lack of personal experience shows in what's on screen.

EVERY disabled person seeks independence.  When you are disabled you seek ways of accomplishing whatever challenges you face.  Overcoming your limitations becomes the focus of your life.  Cliques, aside, disabled people can not do everything but learning what limits you have is life and death, literally.

Though no doctor would ever speak to a patient like the one here,the issues presented are fairly true to the reality for spinal cord injuries, in particular the sex segment which will come as a surprise to many of you.  Limitations can be a bitch, but it does tell a story about making the most of what you have.

The climax is a tad contrived but I loved the ending.",1493596800,,1105,4.829787234042553
8532767,5,B008YUHQEG,Totally rocks! Loved the characters and they pull you in and highly recommend this movie to all to watch.,1489104000,,105,4.578947368421052
