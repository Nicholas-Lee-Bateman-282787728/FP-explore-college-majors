3697997,4,B001MEJXVU,"This is a fairly well done dark house mystery with a surprise ending. The actors did a fine job, and the story holds together. It's perfect for when you want to lose yourself into a nice old-fashioned mystery.",1351987200,7,209,4.526315789473684
3697998,5,B001MEJXVU,"I can't adequately review this movie without giving the plot away. Suffice to say it's a Gothic Murder Mystery with several murders and plot twists that takes place in an old stately English country mansion. Some of the characters are not what they seem and there are hidden secrets to unfold. Overall a very good mystery if you like the type. Don't expect a lot of action, explosions, or graphic violence. However, if sinister surroundings and characters interest you then you'll enjoy this one....surprise ending..!! Overall a good mystery and worth the money.",1260057600,40,562,5.053763440860215

3698003,3,B001MEJXVU,"This is a dated piece with everything that goes with an English Murder Mystery of the 30's and 40's: inappropriately upbeat music, overacting, cutesy humor and some silly dialogue.  But the underlying mystery works so I accepted it for what it is. The movie had its moments and was far from a waste of time.  But if you're looking for something comparable to our modern mysteries like ""Sherlock"" you'll be disappointed. ""They don't make them like this anymore"" isn't always a bad thing.",1395705600,,486,4.843373493975903
3698004,5,B001MEJXVU,A clever Edgar Wallace play set in an English mansion with plenty of suspects and mystery. The Scotland Yard detective anchors the chaos nicely and this is one I'm happy to add to my collection of old mysteries,1387152000,5,210,4.552631578947368
3698005,4,B001MEJXVU,"The Case of the Frightened Lady is, in my opinion, a delightful little mystery film from the '30's.  I love British films and mysteries; I purchased this on a hunch and my hunch paid off.  I've enjoyed it and it's one I pull out and watch again when I'm not interested in the offering on TCM that night. There are some interesting character actors of the British genre in it that you might recognize.  I vote:  Buy it!  It's even better on a cold dark night with a spot of tea laced with a sip of brandy to keep you warm.",1382140800,4,521,4.118811881188119
3698006,3,B001MEJXVU,"I love movies, particularly dramas and mysteries from the thirties, forties & fifties. This was a decent effort.  While I liked the setting, thought the acting was adequate both could have benefited from a stronger script.",1375747200,,222,5.166666666666667
3698007,5,B001MEJXVU,"This is the best old movie I have come by in a while. The ending will not be what you expect which is good. The sound and picture are good and the acting, well not bad. Its a keeper.",1367884800,4,182,3.6923076923076925
3698008,4,B001MEJXVU,"I enjoyed the movie, not the best quality dvd, but not too bad, sound is a little low on my dvd player",1363737600,7,102,3.6818181818181817

8321333,4,B001MEJXVU,"Bring along a bottle of wine and indulge yourself in old time Gothic mystery in black & white - including the concessions sales pitch at the beginning. Think Jane Eyre - and also the unresolved mystery - why would so many aid in the cover up - apart from the explicit motives.  Think Jail House Rock - forget Elvis, look at the supporting cast - who needed a safe gig and why - this is England tailing down during the wreck of Victorianism.
Reasonably good entertainment on a rainy night as Samhain approaches.

Here's a hint - beware of people whose nostrils you can see even when they're not looking straight up.",1509235200,,614,4.473214285714286

8321341,4,B001MEJXVU,"If the opening scene of a woman descending a Gothic staircase and shrieking doesn't immediately discourage further viewing, an interesting story waits to unfold.  True to the description, suspicious characters abound.  And resisting the urge to reveal spoilers, this is one of those old, old English homes which comes with inbred secrets, bound to brick and mortar.

Filmed in the black and white era, when spraying blood and sex scenes were typically deemed unnecessary to tell a story, Case of the Frightened Lady unfolds gradually, through sometimes thick U.K. accents.  Most of the characters are reluctant to divulge information, making the viewer ponder the emerging pattern of the script.  Plot architecture is all about family secrets.  And in the end we wonder how the most trusted people often have left their own personal Mr. Hyde locked away in a cage in the dark, awaiting a more opportune moment.",1424476800,2,910,5.114864864864865
