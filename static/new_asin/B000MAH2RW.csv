8277724,2,B000MAH2RW,"My husband and I are getting ready to have a baby boy. We have looked all over the internet for a video we could watch that would help us understand the real, modern pros and cons of circumcision so we can make the right choice. In desperation I ordered this video off of Amazon since it appeared to be a DVD on the subject. Of course I read the description and new that it was a non-bias look at the procedures, but thought that SURELY there would be no such thing as a video that costed $[...]... FIFTY DOLLARS!!! that just simply showed a close up of three different baby boys get cut up and had no other information on it. The entire DVD was 19 minutes of surgery on the three most common circumcision surgeries in the U.S.

BE WARNED ALSO that although you probably assumed as much, I will confirm for you, this DVD shows full close-ups and full detail of all surgery to newborn boys involved.

Now, there's a reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one:

1) If you are completely uninformed of the kind of procedure you're going to put your baby through, this DVD will give you exact operative details on all three (although if you're like me, your head will be turned most of the time anyway because it's a squeemish video to watch).

2) If you are TEACHING a childbirthing class (like the one my husband and I just took) full of other up-close-and-personal childbearing clips, epesiotomes, epidurals, c-sections and the whole nine yards, this would in fact be one more very useful tool to have ON HAND in a classroom setting in case someone asked about the circumcision procedures. However even then I would not suggest it being one of your go-tos when you have to fill time. I would keep this as a request-only type video and feel out emotionally the members of your classroom to see if it's something they can handle as it is a rather disturbing video to watch.

Overall, I can now officially say that I have a PREFERENCE for which circumcision my son would have now that I have seen all three (as I had no idea what the differences were before watching this), but the video does not provide any medical information, history, pros, cons, etc., for whether or not the procedure is really needed. If the video had costed [...] bucks, it would have been worth it, but 50 dollars for 19 minutes of cutting and no information about the necessity of the procedure is NOT worth it.",1266192000,3,2380,4.4495412844036695
