7760441,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them.,1108857600,2,798,4.089171974522293

7760452,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"On first viewing I found this film puzzling; I knew I was missing plot background detail. A second viewing produced very few additional plot details. I assume those details exist in the DC Comics graphic novels this film is based upon, but the film's plot is confusing without knowing those details. That said, I found this film (and its characters) weak: John Constantine and his earthly friends struggle exhaustingly against the encroaching demons of a smugly superior devil, while the angel Gabriel prioritizes belittling John Constantine's moral weakness over saving humanity's earthly realm. The film effectively uses CGI to depict demons on earth and to depict hell's devastation, but hell's torments are not depicted.",1525392000,,724,5.359649122807017

7760469,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,I got this DVD to replace a copy that had become damaged due to constant replays. This is a good movie that I first got after I first saw it on TV. I normally get DVDs of the movies I really like and this one fits that description. It's a good movie that keeps you sucked in as you watch it. Well worth adding to your collection.,1515628800,,329,3.925373134328358
7760470,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"i really like this movie. It gives answers to the toughest questions life presents to us. Such as, What if angels were real? What if demons were real? What if hell was unleashed upon the earth? What if you are in hell and a male model convention breaks out? I give extra stars to the special effects team for a horrifying and gritty portrayal of hell and Rachael Weisz (Lady Cop) for, after selflessly offering to take her sister's place in hell, doing everything she can save bare ass nudity to get Keanu (Constantine) interested in her sexually. GOOD MOVIE.",1515110400,3,559,4.6

7760472,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"One of my favorites.  I watch it almost every month and always see new things in it.  Keanu Reeves does his usual wooden acting job, but for this movie it works.  Supporting cast is incredible.",1513382400,,193,4.457142857142857

7760474,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"It's about an institutionalized war between Heaven and Hell. Angels literally fighting with demons. The Catholic Church is like Heaven's intelligence agency and is depicted as a creature-hunter organization. A stylized film that's very visually striking. In terms of the story -- well, you shouldn't expect much. The whole thing revolves around a hidden artifact, demons trying to enter the mortal plane, but there is one original concept which I can't reveal without spoiling it. The acting is great for the context. Super stylish and cool by 2005 standards, and still holds up well today. Movie kind of glamorizes smoking though; somehow it even makes getting lung cancer cool.",1512086400,3,679,5.238532110091743

Reeves is quite perfect for this role, even if you are used to the blond version from the DC Comics movie or the TV series, I think this is more charismatic.

7760482,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves I know people think he has a monotone style of acting but it suits the roles he plays. He also has a softer side as seen in the lake house. I enjoyed this movie a lot and rated it around a 4.5. I never read any of the comics and I think that's what's been separating the really good review versus the bad ones. The bad reviews are mostly based on the fact that it didn't follow the comic books while I just enjoyed it as a really good horror thriller. If you haven't read the comics and like movies about demons and angels give Constantine a try.,1510099200,,576,4.017391304347826
7760483,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Liked it. Guess it departs widely from the comic books (don't care how big they are or how much they cost - they are still comic books), but having never read them that particular critique is meaningless to me. Writing is good, casting is great. Lots of special effects, but they fit well and do not over power the film.",1510012800,,320,4.35

I also watched through the credits and was very happy to see... (no spoilers).",1509235200,,378,4.742424242424242

7760492,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I never imagined that I would actually enjoy this movie. Not a big Keanu fan, and not familiar with the graphic novels. But this was a cool and fun movie, even if a bit predictable. Constantine is a modern day exorcist, keeping the balance of good and evil in this world by deporting demons who come through to our plane. But his days are numbered and he knows he is hell-bound, to spend eternity in pain, and with the demons he has banished. When he meets a beautiful police officer whose twin has recently been killed, he finds out about an evil plan and has to do one last act before his time is up.",1508025600,2,602,4.243478260869566

7760497,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,I've only just reasonably got into Hellblazer comics and the Constantine TV series so I have to be truthful..... Yes it has some elements of Hellblazer but I have to say I was rather disappointed in this movie. It just isn't the feeling of Hellblazer enough.  keanu Reeves did not all bad as john but Matt Ryan to me is Constantine. The fact they changed so much of the story original plot for the movie kinda pissed me off BC its one of the best one of the comics early history. I just could not get myself in this movie like I could the comic and series it was kinda bland and I love the Hellblazer comic and show a lot but still movie didn't impress me sorry.,1507248000,,662,4.171875

7760503,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"The story is simple; self-centered John Constantine: Hellblazer (Keanu Reeves) did a ""no no"" in his youth ensuring him a place in the underworld and to compound the problem he is to be short lived due to a smoking habit.

Mean time he, due to his accident he has the ability to see angles and demons. Even though he is conceited and knows where he will be going he still finds time to do some good for mankind and in the process send a few demons back where they came from.

Something has gone horribly wrong with the balance. And with the aid of his young sidekick and a medium that is well done by (Rachel Weisz) he intends to get to the nature of the problem.

The character of Constantine comes from the DC comic world and has been modified a tad to fit a movie with a beginning middle and end.

I could not help but notice Tilda Swinton who played Gabriel. She made you feel that you were watching a first class movie.

The only redeeming feature of value of the movie is not the movie it's self but the audio track that explains wheat they are trying to do in the making of the movie. In fact you could just bypass the movie and listen to the voice over audio instead and save yourself two hours.

I think I should have watched the two disk version as even with the audio track they refer to many things that are not in the movie.",1504915200,4,1336,4.178988326848249

The audio unfortunately has major problems.

7760599,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Does Keanu Reeves play anything but sober, dark men who have forgotten how to smile?

DC Comics C-list superheroes include John Constantine, who is so far down the food chain he doesn't even get spandex.  In the comics, he is untrustworthy, self-absorbed, and very, very English.  Apparently, either Mr. Reeves couldn't carry off a convincing English accent, or casting committee simply couldn't find a British actor willing to play an anti-hero, because this John Constantine is an American.  Or perhaps they didn't read the source material closely -- or simply decided it wasn't important.

You cannot watch this movie without recognizing that the screenplay delves into Christian territory.  When dealing with demons and the devil, Hollywood either ignores God or gets theology so wrong that a believing Christian can only wonder at what they were thinking.  This movie chooses the latter path, and while the entire redemption theme is handled tactfully throughout, a female, half-human/half-angel, F-bomb-dropping Gabriel is certainly more invention than biblical.  And the committed Catholic takes Jesus' name in vain more than once in what would appear a distinct lack of commitment.  Oh, well, at least the special effects were good.  And the actress made a convincing angel!  The screenwriter gets good points, though, for clearly showing good and evil, something that isn't always done when Hollywood explores theology.

The viewer of this movie needs to pay attention to the plot, which is complicated and does not always move in a linear fashion.

One final caution, on my TV, most movies play at volume level 15.  In order to hear the whispered dialog, I had to jack the volume to 30 and sometimes 40.  Of course, there are very loud scenes that needed to go back to 15 or the sound would rattle things off the shelves.  I might have ranked this movie higher had it not been for this fault.",1478390400,,1902,5.0287539936102235

I'm not really aware of all the minor DC Comic characters, and didn't even realize Constantine  was based off of one of them.  Until I saw the DC Comic credit at the beginning of the movie. Usually when I hear of a thriller movie based on religious topics, its a turn - off because of the ridiculous way religion is portrayed.  The crises and action packed scenes combined with a romantic magnetism between Constantine and Angela is masterful.  What topped it off is the deadpan humor throughout the entire movie. It lightens up the movie just enough to enjoy the entire film beginning to end.",1475452800,,671,4.520661157024794

7760618,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Well-done adaptation... Keanu Reeves has the hard-boiled detective shtick down pat. Rachel Weisz also does a great job in her role: These two actors have great chemistry (the mostly-forgettable Chain Reaction a few years before, to me, was carried by the actor's performances, along with Morgan Freeman, and not the plot line); the director was wonderful in spinning a subtle romantic tension. But the real treat in all of this were Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare were absolutely fantastic in their character portrayals. Shia LeBouf managed to get cast, and to be fair he did a pretty good job as a wannabe apprentice...maybe it wasn't acting, but I digress. CGI was a little overdone... it could have been a really creepy movie with a more subtle approach to revealing bad guys and gals, as well as nasty places.

Back then I wasn't into graphic novels at all and had no idea of the origins of the movie.  Just watched it for the second time and enjoyed it a lot.  It actually increased my enjoyment of the movie to ""backward imagine"" the comic book origins of the tale.

Keanu Reeves gives his usual impressive performance.  The supporting cast, especially Rachel Wiesz, are excellent.

That said, there are enough good performances here to make the mess worth dealing with. Rachel Wiesz does a great job throughout the movie. The real standouts though, are Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare.

7760658,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,Keanu Reeves plays an exorcist of sorts who fights Half Breed demons who come to Earth and sends them back to hell. I think this comes from a comic book and I suspect people who like the comic book probably won't like the movie. It's very hard to take a book and turn it into a good movie that is true to the book even a comic book. This one has a fair amount of flashy special effects relatively gruesome scenes but overall it's pretty good.,1467504000,,442,4.151162790697675

7760661,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"A solid four stars for the character, the acting, the visuals and the story. I am not familiar with the original comics and after watching the movie could never picture anyone else but Keanu in the role. He fit it beautifully. It would have been five had it not been for the Biblical themes which might make it more difficult for some viewers to understand it is a fantasy. I really wish the film had taken place in a different kind of sci-fi/fantasy universe!",1467072000,,460,4.488095238095238

Constantine is baller. The music is baller. Shooting demons in the face is extra baller.

7760683,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Obviously a bit of fantasy, and the acting was okay not amazing. But it was original and entertaining enough, with a good ending.  The problem with this type of film is that if gods, demons, devils, angels, etc. really do appear on earth and fight, then there is no need for faith.  Which is mentioned - just before devils and demons and such appear on earth kicking butt.

The film definitely reflects its comic/graphic novel origins. Compared to Marvel, I appreciate that the main character is not much of a superhero, but a cursed man with the gift of being able to see angels and demons.",1461283200,,591,4.556603773584905

I honestly don't think that the main characters in the movie bought it that good and thus they didn't really deliver that well either.  To me it just seemed convoluted and completely pointless.

7760796,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"""Constantine"" may be one of the best awful movies ever made.  Or maybe I'm just the only person on the planet who thought it was a comedy and enjoyed its whimsy.  In any case, even though critics were none too kind to the film, I've always liked it.  I liked it in a theater; I liked it on standard-def DVD; I liked it even more in high-def on HD DVD; and I continue to like it in its new Blu-ray transfer (although, to be fair, the BD looks the same to me as the HD DVD, and there are the same bonus materials involved).

Based on the character of John Constantine from the Vertigo ""Hellblazer"" comic books, this 2005 movie version will probably upset fans of Alan Moore, Jamie Delano, and Garth Ennis's demon-fighting hero with its outlandish dark humor, its wild-eyed monsters, its muddled plot, and its starchy star, Keanu Reeves.  Nevertheless, taken in the right light--that is, with no expectation of finding anything in it even remotely serious--""Constantine"" can be fun.

The movie's prologue begins by introducing a properly dire tone:  ""'He who possesses the Spear of Destiny holds the fate of the world in his hands.'  The Spear of Destiny has been missing since the end of World War II.""

Presumably, the Spear of Destiny to which they refer is the celebrated Spear of Longinus or Spear of Vengeance mentioned in the Arthur legends, the spear reputedly used to pierce Christ's side during the Crucifixion, and the spear Hitler claimed to have found (and lost after the Second World War).  One such spear currently resides in the Hofburg Museum in Vienna, but it's thought to be a medieval fake.  Anyway, in the movie a Mexican scavenger finds the spear, and afterwards the spear facilitates the entrance of demons into our world.  I have no idea where that idea came from, but then, as I've said, we not meant to take anything in this film seriously.

John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a demon slayer, a guardian of mankind against the evil forces of Lucifer and his minions.  According to Constantine, God and the Devil made some kind of bet on which one of them could best persuade people to follow him.  They sent down angels and demons to subtly urge people to do good or bad.  Usually, these angels and demons remain unseen, whispering quietly in our ear, but now things have changed.  Constantine's job is to seek out the spirit demons when they get too frisky and send them back to Hell, but suddenly he finds some of these demons are crossing over bodily into our world.  They're not supposed to do that.  Something is amiss.

Apparently, only Constantine can stop the demons from taking over the world.  I feel so much safer when Keanu Reeves is around.

The fun begins with the opening sequence, where the aforementioned scavenger finds the Spear of Destiny while digging through some rubble, and it immediately makes him invulnerable to pain or death.  What else can you do but laugh at his subsequent collision with a car in the middle of nowhere and the incredible dent he makes in the automobile?  At least, you'll laugh once you've picked yourself up off the floor; I guarantee it will give you quite a start.  And it's also a remarkably well-executed shot for its technical expertise.

Next, we have a scene straight out of ""The Exorcist,"" with a young woman literally climbing the walls and hanging from the ceiling, snarling and hissing, clearly possessed of the devil.  Constantine takes such exorcisms in stride, punching out the demon as a part of a day's work.

So, why is Constantine a demon hunter (or ""Hellblazer"" in the graphic novels)?  Seems he attempted to commit suicide in his youth, a mortal sin according to God, and now he's trying to buy his way into Heaven by doing God's work.  With his natural-born sixth sense (he can see dead people, and he can see living ones for what they really are), he's a one-man army of the Lord; except that the Lord is not exactly going for it, and Constantine is just hoping for the best.  To make matters worse, the poor guy's dying of lung cancer.

The plot really gets going when the twin sister of a police detective, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), jumps off a building to her death.  The coroner says it's suicide, but Angela believes somebody pushed her.  She goes to Constantine for help because on a surveillance tape taken of the fall, her sister's last word was ""Constantine.""  Is that ominous or what?

There's a solid supporting cast who give the story a good deal of color and humor along the way.  Shia La Beouf plays Constantine's young apprentice, Chas Kramer, an amusing cab driver and wannabe demon fighter.  Djimon Hounson plays Papa Midnite, who is something of a sorcerer and the owner of a night club that is neutral ground for half-breeds, demonic or angelic.  Max Baker plays Beeman, Constantine's squirrelly supplier of occult tools.  Tilda Swinton plays Gabriel, a goofy, androgynous, half-breed angel.  British singer Gavin Rossdale plays Balthazar, a spooky half-breed demon.  And Peter Stormore steals the show as Lucifer, a petulant, tough-guy, gangster type with wonderfully weird voice inflections.  I'd liked to have seen more of him in the film.

Not that the movie is all plot and characters; it's educational, too.  For example, Beeman provides Constantine with the following materials and advice:  ""Bullet shavings from the assassination attempt on the Pope; holy water ampules from the River Jordan; and, oh, you'll love this--a screech beetle.  To the fallen it's like nails on a chalkboard.""  Besides that, we learn that the quickest way to visit Hell, short of doing bad things and dying, is to stick your feet in a tub of water.  So, say you're soaking your extremities in a hot basin of water after a long day's work, and your wife tells you to go to Hell; hey, you just might.  Admit it:  How many movies can offer such invaluable counsel?

Then, there are the scenes that stick in memory.  I already mentioned the car crash; another involves swarms of insects that attack Constantine and end up smashing against the front end of a passing automobile.  Think of it as your worst bug-on-the-windshield nightmare.  Or how about brass knuckles with crosses fashioned on them, the perfect weapon for smacking demons.

And there are some good lines:  ""I don't believe in the devil,"" says Angela.  ""Well, you should,"" responds Constantine.  ""He believes in you.""  Or Angela's observation, ""I guess God has a plan for all of us"" and Constantine's reply, ""God's a kid with an ant farm.""  Unfortunately, there are not many such lines.  Mostly, there's just a truckload of CGI graphics interspersed with the occasional quick rejoinder.

Yes, Constantine is a pretty cynical fellow and has a smart-ass comeback for everything.  Too bad he's nothing like the Constantine of the comic books, who is much more rugged looking, with light, sandy hair.  This is yet another thing to incite the wrath of the books' most devoted followers.  But as one who had never read the comic books, did I care?

Eventually, Constantine learns that in order for the penultimate demon, the Devil's son, to cross over into our plane, he would need God's help, which comprises the second half of the film, where elements of Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"" come into play and everything gets even sillier.  By the end of the movie, it's impossible to follow any of the action or tell what's going on, but what, me worry?  The special effects are all the show, and Reeves's wooden acting fits the absurdity of the situations perfectly.

Understand that ""Constantine"" does not work as a superhero comic-book flick any more than the original theatrical release of ""Daredevil"" did.  But ""Constantine"" has a lot more in it that one can view from a purely comical angle.  Heck, even Keanu Reeves comes off as funny the way I see it.  Pretty bizarre, huh?

Video:
This Blu-ray disc offers up the picture in its original theatrical-release dimensions of 2.40:1.  Warners use a dual-layer BD50 for the VC-1, 1080p transfer, providing a high-def image that is obviously sharper and clearer than its SD counterpart, although some slightly oversaturated hues continue, probably intentional on the director's part; he seems especially partial to gold, green, yellow, and brown color schemes.  The definition is mostly excellent, with some moments of softness, and the black levels are superb, intense for maximum contrasts.  The touch of fine grain I noticed in the SD and HD DVD editions remains in BD, especially in darker scenes, appropriate to the film-like quality of the reproduction.

Audio:
You'll find English soundtracks in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1.  Needless to say, I listened in TrueHD, which is top-notch.  The surround sound is all-encompassing, enveloping the listener in a complete aural experience.  The frequency response is wide, the bass fairly deep, the midrange clear, the dynamics strong, and the channel separation precise.  The ""Dragon's Breath"" flamethrower makes a particularly hair-raising noise in the surrounds, as do various rain storms, thunderclaps, telephone rings, weird voices, and fires of Hell.  The sound is clean and well focused, with a taut low end.  If there is any minor problem, it's that the audio has so extended a dynamic range, it may annoy some listeners who will want to keep turning the sound up and down every few minutes.  No problem; it's as it should be.

Extras:
Warner Bros. include on the Blu-ray disc all of the extras found in their two-disc SD set plus the ""In-Movie Experience"" found on their HD-DVD edition.  The ""In-Movie Experience"" uses voice-overs and visual inserts of the director and various others commenting on the action of the film, the acting, the costumes, the makeup, etc.  It's like having a behind-the-scenes documentary running simultaneously during the movie.  I have to admit it beats the usual voice-over audio commentary.

The remainder of the extras include two audio commentaries, the first by director Francis Lawrence and producer Akiva Goldsman, and the second by screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello.  Their comments can be informative, at least when they're not kidding around.

After that is a lengthy series of short featurettes.  These are ""Channeling Constantine,"" ""Conjuring Constantine,"" ""Director's Confessional,"" ""Collision with Evil,"" ""Holy Relics,"" ""Shotgun Shootout,"" ""Hellscape,"" ""Visualizing Vermin,"" ""Warrior Wings,"" ""Unholy Abduction,"" ""Constantine's Cosmology,"" ""Foresight: The Power of Pre-Visualization,"" ""Demon Face,"" and ""A Writer's Vision.""
A music video, ""Passive,"" by A Perfect Circle.  The items last anywhere from a minute-and-a-half to fifteen minutes each and contain a lot of repetition.  You'll be clicking for days.

Things continue with fourteen widescreen deleted scenes, including an alternate ending in a graveyard, again with optional director's commentary; a widescreen teaser and a widescreen theatrical trailer; thirty-four scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Japanese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles, with English captions for the hearing impaired.

Finally, unlike the HD DVD edition, the Blu-ray package includes a standard-definition digital copy of the movie for use with iTunes and Windows Media devices.

Parting Thoughts:
By most standards of good filmmaking, ""Constantine"" is a pretty ragged affair.  Yet I did not find it one of those so-bad-it's-good movies.  I've honestly enjoyed it all four times I've seen it, viewed from my admittedly distorted perspective as one who interpreted practically every scene as comedy.

I have no idea if the filmmakers intended their movie to be a comedy or not.  On one of the commentaries, they say they did try to infuse the film with some humor.  I know the movie tickled my funny bone.  Yeah, I recognize that a lot of other people don't see it that way, but I'll have to live with it.  And the Blu-ray video and sound just make a good thing better.",1433030400,3,12058,4.997992975413949

Even little things like the camera looking from the ground as Constantine drops a cigarette out a cab window, then flipping 180 degrees to a God's Eye view as he steps out of the cab ... I could count off such neat cinema shots in this film all day. And the special effects are quality ... I think we are too used to modern-day CGI to appreciate just how good.

Keanu Reeves gives the character the right flavor of detached despondency, while at the time revealing his desire to escape hell in outbursts of rage and anguish. I know some don't like Reeves because they feel he is flat. I think he is a fine actor that brings a style to film that is a pleasant variety. I don't want the same kind of actor in every film I see.

I though the story was easy to follow with good plot twists. People who felt it was muddled ... well, I think their just dim-witted and want everything fed to them. ;-) Those who say it is straightforward, I think they just don't know how to get absorbed into a story.

If you like Sci-Fi/Fantasy, or comic story folklore, I think you should give Constantine a try. ... and just sit back and enjoy it.",1428883200,,1214,4.246753246753247

7760851,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"The best movie ever.  Keanu Reeves best performance.  Ignore Shia Laboef, at least he doesn't harm the film.",1423958400,,108,4.944444444444445
7760852,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,Good Movie........,1423872000,,18,8.5
7760853,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,You know Reeves just always brings it. In his unique style he always makes you want to watch his movies. I love this movie in particular because of it's weaving in and out of what you think will happen and what does happen. You sort of feel sorry for him that he has to live a little longer without cancer at the end of the movie for punishment from Satan.,1423785600,,356,4.1

7760858,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I rented this movie from my local library in December of 2013. I thought it was neither good or bad at first, but. The film takes place in Los Angeles (which ironically is called the city of angels) and tells the story of John Constantine, a private eye who is able to see things from a spiritual point. This may seem like a cool ability, but not to Constantine it isn't. Constantine must help a policewoman, Angela Dodson, who is trying to solve the mystery of her twin sisters' suicide. The story itself was decent, but not as good as X-Men or Superman. The action was gritty and intense enough to be rated R by the MPAA. The production value and visuals were pretty cool and undeniably creepy. There is one thing that bugs me about the storyline, though. The film gives viewers the idea that God and His forces are restricted to Heaven, while Satan and his forces are restricted to hell. As a Christian, I wasn't offended, but at the same time I have no clue where the writers got that concept from. Keanu Reeves did a good job as Constantine, but I still think his best works are THE MATRIX trilogy and 47 RONIN. Rachael Weisz as Angela was good. If they ever chose to remake this film, I suggest they make the character British like he was in the comics and cast someone like Orlando Bloom, Toby Kebball, Dougray Scott or Colin Farrell to portray him.",1422835200,,1356,4.428

7760954,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,Good movie. We don't think this movie got the accolades it deserved. A good twist on paranormal and on good and evil.

Maybe the movie just came out at the wrong time.,1414281600,,299,4.155172413793103
7760955,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"While possibly not 100% faithful to the source material, Constantine is a lovely introduction to the tone of thr universe and John himself. Keanu Reeves protrays  much different man than Neo of The Matrix fame. Perhaps the weakest points is the casting of Rachel Weiss as she feels easily replaced by any actress. Those who would like shows such as Supernatural should look into this as an interesting rendition of DC's character before the NBC show. Constantine is an interesting character drama that shows a version of Earth stuck between a wager of Heaven and Hell and we are just along for the ride.",1414108800,,603,4.798076923076923

7760976,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is one of those movies on one needs to watch several times over to truly enjoy it.  The movie is dark in both the literal and figurative ways.

Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man whose mission is ridding the world of demons and other manner of evil.

Enjoy the movie.  Watch it a first, a second, then third time.  After that, then make your decision on whether this was a good movie or not.",1411257600,,411,4.355263157894737

7760980,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'll begin by saying that this is not the Constantine you may remember from Hellblazer. However, its clear that the Hellblazer universe was used as a reference. John Constantine is played by Keanu Reeves (47 Ronin) who surprisingly does a very good job of bringing depth to Johns character. He is rude, disrespectful, and charming in some strange way. The plot was well written, though the religious references were a bit on the flimsy side, stating things like God isn't entirely in control and doesn't really care too much about us mere mortals. I was pleased that some of the old characters were brought back for the film. The witch doctor club owner Papa Midnight makes an appearance, as well as johns pathetic friend who has a drinking problem, rather than a heroin problem as in the comics. As good of a movie as it was, I still had a few complaints. The first would be that the archangel Gabriel was a woman, which I found a bit odd. The second would be that John and Isabelle, the lead supporting actress, didn't seem to have a very good chemistry about them. Another thing that bothered me, though not related to the actual film, was the quality for the instant video was a bit blurry. All in all however this movie is defiantly worth your time, especially if your a big Constantine fan.",1410739200,9,1296,4.5905172413793105

7761067,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'm a long time John Constantine fan. I took note of his character when he was introduced in Swamp Thing in the late 80s and began reading his title when it was introduced in 1993. I collected and read the comic until it was cancelled. I'm aware of the differences between a comic book title and a movie. Unfortunately the changes that were made for the benefit of the movie did not enhance the character of John Constantine. Making him an American instead of a brit was a mistake. Setting the story in America instead of Great Britain with no bridge to Constantine's British roots was also a mistake. My main problem with the movie is that there is very little genuine horror or suspense in the narrative. Essentially John Constantine is the reincarnation of Merlin the wizard recast as a British street urchin. Keannu Reeves did the best he could given the script and his acting capability. Francis Lawrence (the director) did the best that he could given the limitations of the script and his own obvious unfamiliarity with the character. Even though the supporting cast is noteworthy and there are scenes that are mildly visually interesting, overall the movie is mediocre. This is especially true given the rich palate of stories that the screenwriters could have drawn upon.",1394064000,,1280,4.822727272727272
7761068,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"This has got be one of those movies that is so awful that there should be an Oscar category for it--but what, I'm not sure. The ""plot"" has something to do with people caught between Heaven and Hell, psychics, demons, the angel Gabriel, and Satan (who looks like Telly Savalas). All parties battle it out in pretty messy stile (lots of guts and green slime), and about all I could figure out is that Gabriel gets demoted to human status, Satan goes back to Hell, and Constantine is not able to stop his chain smoking. I think the people who created this thing had some high-tech film equipment, too much money, a fairly good special effects director; and must have been drinking heavily on the set, along with the writer.",1393891200,,720,4.546153846153846

7761128,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Reeves is excellent at being the jaded hero, the special effects were awesome and a young Shia LeBouf (transformers) was comic as always in his brief but potent cameo.

The storyline is your basic angels versus demons type thing, of course the only one who can save the world is the guy who got booted out of hell. The typical genre is transmuted, though, as Reeves is quite selfish. He's really only going through the motions in order to redeem himself. His character goes through some serious changes throughout the film, though, which made Reeves interesting to watch.

I must say, too, that Tilda Swinton is amazing as always, and I enjoyed seeing her wings get ripped off. She's one angry angel! Rachel Weisz is an under-rated actress, but she really shone in this film as the suffering victim trying to avenge her sister's life.

This film also restored my faith in Reeves as an actor - after the Matrix I wondered how we even made it to Hollywood (that's content for another review, though) - so this one is really worth watching. Great film.",1375488000,3,1049,4.65945945945946

The ""balance"" spoken of in this fictional work is interesting to witness as the characters on both sides of good and evil play with man. great special effect.

While the tone is often deadpan, it's still a tone I can't seem to get enough of.  Or maybe it was ""MY PRIVATE IDAHO"" as a very convincing hustler.

Sure, there could have been a lot more character development and growth but hey, there was only 90 minutes to play with. I thought the storyline was thought out and actually allows for one's imagination to delve deep inside this plot. Not only were there many mythical ideas and religious ones as well, they threw in concepts from multiple dimensions (hell, heaven and regular life) all here surrounding us at the same time on many planes of existence. I thought the guy who played the devil did a fantastically creepy job! He was like a snake! From angels to demons to Keanu Reeves I'd say this movie is worth a watch...

7761164,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"The movie itself seemed like the Matrix with demons instead of super computers.  Anyways I'm just reviewing the blu ray quality rather than the movie since there is no short abundance of film reviews.  There were no memorable grainy scenes that I can remember.  Likewise, there were no shots that were just spectacular.  This may have to do with my tv getting old as it is heavily used and about 5 years old.  I'm not sure about the lifespan of the Samsung LCD HDTV's, but I imagine the quality deteriorates over time.  My stance still remains the same- Nothing terrible to speak of, and nothing amazing either.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 3 because I am finding it harder and harder to find blu-ray films that aren't grainy during dark scenes, so this release gets 4 since there were no scenes that stick out in my mind like a lot of other movies.",1364169600,,852,4.458064516129032

Personally, I enjoy watching the movie. Yes, the story is a bit weak, and yes, Keanu Reeves is NOT John Constantine. What I enjoy are the visuals. I enjoy the costumes, the props and the sets.

The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers.

He has inoperable lung cancer, and he does his job to try to buy his way into Heaven before his time runs out. His faith is somewhat lacking though. He meets a young woman who's twin sister's suicide is surrounded by mystery. Will John be able to solve the mystery of this woman's ""suicide"" and stop a desperate plot to overtake Hell? Even if he does will his own soul be saved?

This movie came out of nowhere it seemed. It was a fresh new idea and it has great actors. This a lot to like about Constantine. I don't think I've met someone yet that didn't like this movie.

7761220,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'll be the first to admit that this film is not without its faults, first and foremost being Keanu Reeves. You can tell that this casting choice was made by producers who were hoping to ride on the coat-tails of the Matrix series. Reeves' stoic performance drains the acerbic wit and douchebaggery that Hellblazer fans have come to love from John Constantine. However, we get a surprisingly good performance from Rachel Weisz, who clearly put a lot more effort into her work than Reeves. Furthermore, the film has a very solid sense of visual style, which doesn't solely depend on its visual effects. At times, it simply makes use of good cinematography and editing, which is enhanced by Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelt's refreshingly original soundtrack. Perhaps this film's strongest asset, however, is its script, which has its occasional drags and forced dialogue. However, it succeeds where many recent comic-book adaptations have failed. It gives us a fairly original story that contains some genuine surprises and some cool action. Sure, it didn't deserve any Oscars, but it was a solid B-movie that was under-appreciated for its time.",1348444800,,1140,5.101604278074866
7761221,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I don't know why people give this movie such a hard time.  I admit, fantasy action horror movies are not my favorite genre as I'm typically partial to artsy, pretentious indie movies that claim to be provocative.  However, I was pretty surprised how entertained I was by ""Constantine"".  I don't know the source material as I don't read comic books nor do I feel that comic book movies are typically very good, but ""Constantine"" manages to put together a pretty fascinating universe that's based on Christian mythology.

The best aspect of the movie is how it doesn't go too far in any direction.  Keanu Reeves plays the anti-hero who does good, but for selfish reasons.  Weisz plays the love interest, but is never pushed into an awkward kiss/sex scene.  And Reeves, while successful, is not ridiculously invincible.

Obviously fans disagree with me, but I have a hard time understanding why crap like ""Fantastic Four"" or even the much less crappy ""The Dark Knight"" are rated higher than this one.  If you like comic book movies (or hell, if you were raised Catholic), you really should see this one.",1346889600,2,1100,4.808510638297872
7761222,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,I love this movie.  I can watch it over and over again.  Perhaps it's how cavalier Constantine is about eternal consequences.  It is certainly tongue in cheek.,1346457600,,159,4.814814814814815
7761223,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I love this movie. I'm not a fan of the original graphic comics - - just never crossed my radar, not that I travel the right circles (sadly) -- so i am ordering a rebinding of the original series, set 1, today. I remember seeing this the first time and thinking, eh, it's ok. But I knew that was because some element touched something basic in me. But I watch it again and again over the years and love it more every time. Now--exactly today -- i would say, i'm an entrenched cult fan. My status as a KR fan completely aside (and undiscussed) is irrelevant. Although if this film had been made with the originally envisioned Nicholas Cage (who I will freely confess my belief to be a truly great actor) it would have had a completely different feel, tone, and I'm not sure I would have liked this combination. I absolutely adore Rachel Weisz without qualification. (KR's career has been attended by so much controversy I just abstain). I feel the chemistry is sufficient, sorry I can't say more, but again put this in context - I still absolutely love this movie for some indefinable subliminal (or sublime) factor I can't put into words. And the more times I watch it the more strongly I feel this way.

7761227,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'm a long time comics reader, who started following John Constantine back when Alan Moore created him in the pages of Swamp Thing.  I read his excellent Vertigo series and enjoyed it. I acknowledge that this movie strays pretty far from the original character.  He should be played by Sting, or someone who looks and sounds like him, for instance. I know that as a comics fan, and a fan of horror movies in general, I'm supposed to be appalled by its very existence.

However.  All that being said - I love this movie for lots of reasons.

First off: Keaneau is no Brando or even Depp.  Never will be.  But this is my favorite performance of his career by far.
Second: the story is excellent, delineated by some clever and engaging dialog.
Third: every supporting actor in this is excellent, especially Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare.
Fourth: Peter Stormare is the best Satan ever committed to film.
Fifth: The direction is excellent, with fine pacing, and a good, cohesive look that's neither dull nor overly-flashy.
Sixth: Fine effects, with particularly well-realized ""hell"" sequences.

If you're on the fence about seeing this film, let me help push you over - I think this is truly one of the best comic-book adaptations, and one of the best action/horror movies ever made.  It's far better than a lot of people give it credit for, in my opinion, and the very least it deserves is one watching.  I think you may be won over, as I was.

7761229,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine isn't Citizen Kane, but then few movies are. I've heard it compared unfavorably to The Exorcist, but heretically I must disagree. The Exorcist has always seemed more funny than scary, OR believeable, and this just gets worse as the years go by. (The scariest bit of the Exorcist was over by minute 10 in the movie). Perhaps it makes a difference if you're a Catholic instead of a Prod.

ANYWAY, this movie is NOT muddled, it sounds just fine on a normal TV, (can't comment upon home theater), is not a great copy of the comic books, but frankly that is an improvement in my view. That being said this was a pretyy darn good supernatural action-type thriller. The theology was not so bad (aside from mixing up verse references in the Bible: book, chapter, verse). All in all I was astounded to find that the movie did not get a better reception. I DO have suspicions however.

At the end of "" Ironman "" there is one of those irritating ""after movies"". The room was full of comic book nerds and when S. Jackson came on the screen they all ooohhed "" Nick Fury!!!"". My son and I who saw it with my brother (who is a comic book nerd) laughed out loud and pissed off my bro. Some of these folks demand exact correspondence to their childhood fantasies, and when they don't get them they take their revenge. All that I can say for it is that I liked it quite a bit as a stand alone movie and wish that they had made more.",1340064000,,1426,4.317164179104478
7761230,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Despite the poor critic reviews, I found that I still enjoyed this movie. Keanu Reeves fit the role of Constantine nicely, but I will admit to a bit of bias in liking most every movie he has starred in. Tilda Swinton played a great angel, Gabriel - at least within the confines of Gabriel's plotted role which I believed to be a bit farcical. That was my only real complaint about the movie plot - that it was premised upon Gabriel betraying God and allying with Lucifer's son to bring hell to Earth. But then to be fair, The Prophecy trilogy are among my favorite movies and they are premised upon Gabriel leading a rebellion against Heaven and attempting to wipe out humanity.

The story kept a quick pace, perhaps too quick at points in that they didn't really explain much of Constantine's history nor really give much of anything to add any real depth to his character. They seemed to make everything shallow and thus simple. That he is an uncaring prick that is self destructive with booze and cigarettes. It is also asserted by Gabriel that he is trying to ""buy"" his way into heaven by banishing demons to hell to atone because he committed suicide (though was resuscitated) as a teen, an act deemed a mortal sin destining him for eternal damnation. He was shown briefly as a boy being tormented by the sights of demons and parents who put him through hell by putting him in institutions and allowing electric shock therapy while he was fully awake and without pain relief prior to his suicide and resuscitation. That is all we are shown about his character. There is nothing about his allies, who they were and how he met/came to work with them. They were simply throw aways rather than being used to tell us more about Constantine and his history.

I can only assume that they did this because there was an expectation/assumption that the audience be familiar with the comic series. There was certainly little here to really familiarize the character of Constantine to the audience and thus it didn't really create much emotional attachment to his character by the audience. This perhaps more than anything is what damned this movie to poor reviews and poor box office showing.

In any case, despite its poor showing in box office revenues, I do hope to see a sequel some day and preferably with Keanu Reeves as Constantine again. Hopefully though with a better defined character that can connect with the audience.",1339372800,4,2424,4.685446009389671

For a first-time director, I have to give some credit for what he was able to pull off and I think the special features give audiences a better understanding of him and his intent.

7761239,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success.

There are some plot holes and irrational premises that, if you think too much about them, could mar your enjoyment of the movie.  On the other hand, you're already watching a movie that talks about demonic possession, angels and demons involving themselves in human activities, and a sort of cat-and-mouse battle between Heaven and Hell.  Glossing over a few illogical bits shouldn't require too much more effort.

The special effects are good.  They showed some great imagination.  In many scenes, there are startling and sometimes disturbing images and events.  I found myself frequently bewildered by what was going on - though the questions were usually resolved later on in the film.

I loved the various interesting characters - Constantine, the angel Gabriel, Balthazar (a half-demon), Papa Midnight (former witch doctor).  They were often complex, multi-dimensional characters.

The story line involves atrocious theology - wholly unlike any religious teachings - but it's fun anyway.

In Constantine's world, shady dealers sell dragon's breath and holy water to people like Constantine, who can see demons in their true form, and battle them back to hell. But, chain-smoking, coughing up blood, it's not demons that are going to get him, it's lung cancer.

Constantine isn't selfless, especially with death so close. He wants to win his way into the good graces of god, but no matter how many souls he saves, it's not enough. Or so his mentor, a half-breed angel-human, Gabriel [Tilda Swinton], tells him. Not until he stops squandering his gift (Constantine would call it a curse), and does good for the sake of doing good. But Constantine calls it unfair, and refuses to play. Gabriel has no answers for him--tormented by the demons, Constantine attempted suicide as a youth, and was dead for two minutes. For that sin, he is damned.

The strange world Constantine lives in has become even stranger. Full demons are attacking him and others, something they are not supposed to be able to do. Half-breeds, part human, part demon or angel, can exist on our plane, but full demons and angels stay home, in hell or heaven. Constantine must find the reason for this breach of the rules before the worst of the worst cross over into our plane and consign all humanity to hell.

7761255,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Sadly I missed out on the Hellblazer series by DC Comics under the Vertigo label when this film was first released.  Based on these great graphic novels. Constantine is about a hard-smoking & drinking guy who is not just an exorcist, but a guy who can see the Other Side.  In the film's mythology, both heaven and hell are in place with Earth.  Hell looks like L.A. during a nuclear holocaust.  So what else is new?

Anyway, the film does have its share of plotholes which I found distracting.  These guys are scavenging around a junk yard in Mexico when a board breaks and a guy pulls out a knife wrapped in a Nazi flag and immediately becomes possessed by it.  The Sword is explained later in the film but not the Nazi connection.  How did it get there?  Did the Nazis use these artifacts?

When our young possessed man walks, cattle fall dead at his feet which is a cool effect but not many others drop dead, just animals.  Huh?  OK, I can live with that.

Rachael Weisz is the police detective whose twin sister dies jumping off a building.  I did note in these kinds of movies, glass breaking and lots of water ensue.  Quite interesting how the director uses these ploys to try to evoke mood and mythology.  At times it works, as with the green-eyed cat used by Constantine to check out Hell.  How Rachel's character's twin knows Constantine is never explained, either.

Despite the insipid acting of a police detective (I mean, would you be an L.A. cop and let yourself be placed in a tub of water by a guy who lives above a bowling alley?  Yes, suspension of disbelief, but really now), the on-again-off-again Gabriel angel and the under-appreciated Shia LeBoeff, the special effects, the story and the mood went at a decent pace.  Enough to keep you interested in what happens next and the surprising but underwhelming ending.

Keanu Reeves is his usual over-serious self, does a great conflicted character as he tries to buy his way into heaven despite the demerit suicide of his younger life.  Long story.

My DVD had an alternate ending which was ""OK"" but still left me wanting.  The deleted scenes were thankfully deleted.  :P

I'll probably pick up the Garth Ennis graphic novels first and watch this again.  Not a bad entry into the Constantine mythology.

Better:

7761256,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"The Feb/2005 released movie Constantine,based on the Hellblazer comic series,comes to DVD in a widescreen edition that is interesting in its premise but falters in its' delivery.
The story involves one John Constantine(Keanu Reeves)who has always had the ability to see things people weren't ""meant to see"".He has done alot of bad things in his life and he has tried to atone for them by working against evil so when he goes his path will lead up and not down. One day he is approached by a police woman named Angela Dodson(Rachel Weisz)to help her regarding her twin sister's untimely death;a plunge off of a roof. At first John balks but relents,soon realizing there is more to the death than meets the eye. John journeys to the other side and back and even assists Angela in doing the same,but they realize too late that her sisters death was basically a ruse to get at Angela.
John learns that the archangel Gabriel is actually working with the son of the devil to unleash his progeny onto the world. In order to do this Angela becomes the host for the child and the angel will use the ""spear of destiny""(the actual tip of the lance that was used to kill Jesus on the cross)to open her womb and release evil to rule man. Gabriel reckons that only those that survive the time to come will be worthy of God's real salvation. In the meantime John has summoned the Devil himself in a last ditch attempt to foil the Devil's son and the archangel's plans. The Devil indeed stops the birth and renders the angel wingless and earth bound. He returns to John who asks that Angela's sister be let free from Hell in his stead. This is a sacrifice and the Devil has been tricked but in one last effort to keep John from going heavenward,he removes the lung cancer that is killing him and keeps him earth bound to live out his life;hoping one day he will slip up and be his forever.
The movie has ALOT of promise throughout with an interesting plot of good versus evil playing out between a man desperate to be redeemed and the evil that would take over the world. The special effects are well done especially in the fight scenes and those involving the glimpses of Hell. However the side plots of Angela and her sister,his side kick Chas Kramer(Shia LaBeouf),his priest friend Father Hennessy(Pruitt Vince)and other characters are just dealt with so heavy handedly,that the plot's narrative flow suffers considerably everytime we go from the action scenes and back to the plot/character advancement. It's a stop/start of a roller coaster ride that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film. The only three characters I found engaging at all and enhanced the film to any degree,besides Reeve's Constantine,were John's friend Scavenger(Jesse Ramirez),Gabriel(Tilda Swinton) and a beautifully played evil Satan by Peter Stormare. The others were just nondescript window dressing.
Technically this film has been transferred well and is presented in its wide screen format. Extras include 18 minutes of so called ""additional scenes"" which are nothing other than expanded or alternate scenes;with or without commentary. There is also the theatrical trailer. This DVD is actually Disc One of the original two disc release version,just so you know.
In conclusion I found Constantine one with a unique and different take on the whole Angels versus Demons,good versus evil chestnut,but overall the plot is a roller coaster of stops and starts which detract from its flow and overall enjoyment;despite the good S/FX.It could/should have been better. I recommend it as a little above average.",1273363200,,3578,4.876847290640394

7761261,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Based on the HELLBLAZER comics, John Constantine (played like a robot by Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter that can see demons and angels. His responsibility is to keep them in line if they go beyond what is allowed in tipping the balance between good and evil. The film revolves around detective Angela Dodson (the gorgeous Rachel Weisz) and her twin that commits suicide. She seeks the help of Constantine to determine what external forces may have played a role in her death. As they unravel the mystery they learn that her sister's death was only to draw Angela to play a part in a diabolical scheme. The concept and story are great. The supporting roles are filled by great actors like Shia LeBeouf, Tilda Swinton and check out who plays Lucifer! Keanu just kills it. He was great in the Matrix when asked to play like a robot because that's about all he is good at, lately. In Constantine, it just doesn't work. Viggo Mortensen or Guy Pearce would have made this a 4 star movie, but although the story and effects are good...Keanu brings it down a notch.

7761263,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Putting aside the cheap Keanu jokes, this is his best film of this past decade. The Matrix? Pfft. Yes, I've seen The Lake House, and Something's Gotta Give, and A Scanner Darkly (actually, never finished it), and none of them boast a Keanu performance that can be honestly called 'essential'. He's good, but passable.

Surprising, then, that a superhero movie based on an iconic, blond, *English* demonslayer would end up one of Reeves' definitive roles. He nails the jerkiness and been-there-done-that attitude of the character perfectly. (I would have thought James Marsters would be a better fit. Who knew?)

Anyone who has seen End of Days will see similarities here. Between the two, I prefer Constantine, if only because the female lead (Rachael Weisz) isn't annoyingly weak in this one. Granted, Angela still finds herself in peril, but at least she isn't a jittery mess, unlike Robin Tunney who had to be dragged place to place by Arnold for the whole movie.

The film wouldn't be half the success it is without the dual performances of Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare as the archangel Gabriel and Satan, respectively. Stormare is supposed to be a surprise, but his version of Satan is already fairly well-known, even if the movie itself is underrated. It just proves that with awesome actors, even such well-trodden ground as a biblical action thriller can be spun in an original direction.",1262736000,,1400,4.9743589743589745

7761270,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is a great movie.  It is based on the comic book series Hellblazer, and is about a Con-man/Magician.  In the movie, Constantine played by Keanu Reeves, is hired to investigate a suicide, that leads him into the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell.  It is a solid movie, one of my favorite Comic book to movie adaptation.  The Visual effects are intense, and the story keeps you interested.  If you have never read the comic, the movie does a good job on its own.  A suggestion would be to pick up the comic and read it before you watch this movie, so it is more enjoyable.",1253664000,,588,4.348623853211009

7761279,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Keanu Reeves, you sure have a penchant for. . .interesting. . .roles.  And playing a daemon-fighting supernatural pariah in the quirky film CONSTANTINE is definitely one of them.  Wow.  The machinations and grandstanding and political posturing between Good and Evil, Heaven and Hell, are every bit as diabolical as what goes on in Washington.  Who would've thunk it?

Reeves chain smokes, and mumbles, and sleepwalks through this role as if he wished he were somewhere else, thus making the viewer equally ambivalent.  Tilda Swinton as an androgynous Gabriel is quite the howler.  And Shia LaBeouf, isn't your fifteen minutes just about up?  Yet for everything that really annoyed me about CONSTANTINE, there were some definite pluses.  Djimon Hounsou is always good, and Rachel Weisz plays an easy-on-the-eye victim of the forces of Hades.  But I really liked Peter Stormare as a most lascivious Lucifer; Stormare comes along at the knick of time, and saves CONSTANTINE from falling apart.  Yet I still don't know why I give this movie three stars.  Guess the devil made me do it.

7761284,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"After reading the reviews its become painfully clear that people who have given bad reviews expected too much from the movie. If your a fan of the comic book, then your probably not going to like the movie because rarely does movies based on comic characters live up to expectations. However I would ask that you watch the movie with no expectations. Its entertaining, and the actors have done a wonderful job. Special effects are also pretty good. The story line is pretty much easy to follow unless while the movie was playing you decided to not pay attention for some reason.

Keanu Reeves has played the role well. He comes of with a I don't care attitude which is probably what you would expect if the Devil wanted you, God locked you out of Heaven, every demon from hell to earth wanted your head and your terminally ill with not much time left.

Rachel Weiz has also done a good job with her role. Another reason why people may not like the movie is the fallen angel theme but this is not the first time that this has been done.

Overall its a great movie to watch, extremely enjoyable and all I would advice is to watch it without any preconceived notion of what to expect.",1231459200,,1181,4.433179723502304
7761285,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"While the film includes some interesting visuals, it is bogged down by rather heavy-handed Catholic theology.

All in all, I was rather bored by the end and found myself looking at the clock.

7761286,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I am a person that is not at all familiar with the source material that Constantine is drawn from. I also read some other reviews here and found them mostly not helpful as they are dominated by fans of the graphic novels(?) picking at details that most people won't ever notice (like me).

Constantine is what I call a great versus movie. One guy against big odds trying to find a way to win. In this case, it's one man versus Hell and Heaven (Hell mostly) trying to stop the end of the world. Doesn't get much bigger than that odds-wise. The main character has all kinds of flaws to overcome, and that makes you pull for him even more. The story is well told, but can be a little heavy on the obscure biblical dialogue. I found myself rewinding here and there to hear some of the more obscure points revealed in the story. This is a small complaint because the monologues do fit with the vibe of the story, so just think of them as added atmosphere. The effects are all excellently done, and the visual style is both creepy and beautiful in equal measure. This is a better film than many gave it credit for when it was released. If you enjoy an atmospheric action thriller, with a bit of horror and fantasy thrown in, then this is the flick for you.",1226966400,3,1250,4.319148936170213

7761289,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Loosely based upon the dark comic book and graphic novel series published by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DC-Comics/dp/0756641195/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DC Comics</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/0756641225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>, Constantine is a supernatural thriller with amazing visual effects, thrilling action, and a great cast. Unfortunately, the film's screenplay, which was written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, fails to capture the spirit of the books. Rather than keeping the characters as they are in the books, the writers have taken liberties that minimalize the effect of the story. In the books, John Constantine is a blond-haired British anti-hero. Here he's played by Keanu Reeves, with black hair and an American accent. Normally I wouldn't complain about such trivial details, but the character of Constantine is further changed from his comic book counterpart. This brings me to one of the film's greatest strengths; it's original and unafraid to make changes. Breaking away from many of the conventions found in the ""superhero"" genre, Constantine dares to be somber and politically incorrect. Can you name any other ""comic book"" film where the hero has cancer, is suicidal, and generally disliked by everyone that he associates with? Nope, I didn't think so.

Demon hunter and exorcist, John Constantine has never been a popular guy, but his talents are in high demand. Constantine has the ability to see damned spirits and the knowledge necessary to send them back to Hell. The only problem is that he's a chain-smoking, cynical, selfish S.O.B. and he's just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. When Constantine is contacted by detective Angela Dodson to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, Constantine discovers a demonic conspiracy to bring about the apocalypse. Relying on a small group of demon hunters, occultists, and half-breeds (a term for Earth-bound angels and demons), Constantine wages a war against the Devil. But it's only a matter of time before his cancer overpowers him and the sins of his past decide his fate in the afterlife. Will John Constantine be sent to Hell for his misdeeds, or will the gates of Heaven part for this proud and defiant sinner? In the battle between two worlds, between Heaven and Hell, between all that's good and all that's evil, between the holy and the profane... John Constantine fights for the middle ground.

The big budget action/thriller features an atypical cast, which with the exception of odd man out Keanu Reeves, fits the film's anarchic atmosphere perfectly. Though Keanu gives a fine performance, his looks and his mannerisms never seem right for the character, who was supposedly modeled after Clint Eastwood as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry/dp/B0015XHQTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry</a>&nbsp;and Sting, the lead singer of the Police. The cast includes Rachel Weisz as Angela and Isabel Dodson, Shia LaBeouf as Chas, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, Djimon Honsou as Papa Midnite, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Peter Stormare as Satan. Each member of the diverse cast gives a worthy performance, but the standout here is indie film star Tilda Swinton, who plays the beatific and androgynous angel Gabriel with a delicious irony.
As has often been the case with films based upon characters created by Alan Moore, Constantine became a showcase for the latest computer effects rather than focusing on the deeply flawed characters that made the books so successful.
With the film's blasphemous overtones, it's no wonder that many religious groups were up in arms about the portrayal of Biblical figures. Still the film serves up about as much theological discussion as similarly ironic film RoboCop did for discussions about law enforcement, which is fine by me. Not every film needs to take itself so seriously and Constantine doesn't. Another flaw of the film is the direction, which feels both forced and mechanical in its execution. Directed by music video auteur Francis Lawrence, who focuses on creating a visually stunning but emotionally devoid alternate reality populated by all manner of miscreants and lost souls. If you're looking for a thought provoking film about redemption through spirituality, then Constantine will likely disappoint. But if what you seek is a fast-paced thriller with lots of action and witty dialogue, then Constantine is for you.

7761293,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'm not a particular fan of Keanu Reeves's acting (exceptions include, mainly, THE MATRIX, in which I enjoyed his work very much).

I'm an admirer of the original DC-universe comic character Constantine only to the extent that I enjoyed his appearance in the first Sandman graphic novel. Constantine's stand-alone adventures are not so much gritty in a noir kind of way as they are graphically uninspiring, and that, perhaps with some dialogue issues, is why I've never found them engaging, despite their premise.

The film version departs radically from the comic, and, for me, that was a sound approach. Visually, it's far more arresting than the graphic novels and much more noir in flavor--although, obviously, it's a supernatural noir. Although critics weren't especially found of this movie,the script is more than solid, the cast and acting very fine, and the ancillaries (soundtrack, special effects, editing, etc.) all terrific.

Maybe it's because I'm a horror writer and have been a horror fanatic for all my life but this movie was different from most of the horror that is being circulated around today.  What makes it different?  Well, for starters, it is thought provoking.  You can't just waste 2 mindless hours watching a Jason or Michael Myers hacking up everyone who crosses their path.  This movie has a level of depth to it that is rarely seen in today's cut and hack horror.  That was automatically a bonus for me.  Reeves character is conflicted, not one that is some religious freak pouring out all his righteous anger on the demonic entities he encounters.  Even Gabriel, God's angel, was conflicted in this movie, losing sight of who's side he/she was really on.  In most of the cases, there were no true lines dividing good from evil and in my mind, that is more true to life that typical representations.  This movie was entertaining, action-packed, interesting and fun.  I highly recommend it to all horror fans.",1220140800,,1095,4.592783505154639

7761297,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine was a very pleasant surprise. All the warning flags were up: a much-changed Alan Moore comic book premise (shifted from the UK to LA), a music video director and Keanu Reeves reunited with his dire Chain Reaction co-star Rachel Weisz. Luckily the changes take, the director actually knows how to tell a story and play a scene and Rachel Weisz has learned to act a little in the intervening years. It's damned hero (even Tilda Swinton's rather wonderful Archangel Gabriel tells him ""You're f****d."") trying to buy his way into heaven by `deporting' demons is worthy of a franchise of his own, and the film is far more imaginative and entertaining than you'd expect. It's just surprising that, with lines like ""God's just a kid with an ant farm,"" the fundies didn't firebomb the theatres that played it.",1208822400,,813,4.856115107913669
7761298,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is my favorite comic book movie of all time. Not only does the character display REAL FLAWS, which is refreshing, but he also has power without physically changing. In other words, he is a hero, without a flashy suit. He is cursed, and as an anti-hero that makes him earn our trust, and admiration.

If you are watching this movie and are trying to figure it out from a Catholic point of view....okay, it's a movie. So stop the shenanigans, and enjoy the bug guy, the twin psychics, the voodoo priest, the ability to send anything to hell and to call upon the angels.

If you are watching this movie and you have already hated Mr Reeves, please note that you are biased. He plays the character of Constantine as he was depicted in the comics well. In fact there are not too many others in Hollywood that I could imagine as irreverent and brooding as Keanu Reeves. To boot, my favorite devil portrayal makes an appearence near the end.",1206835200,2,946,4.526315789473684

When it was over, I wanted to watch it again, and again! The cast was perfect! The movie was positively spell-binding! The script was poetry! What a story!!  I have never been so utterly entertained in all my movie-going life!  I just learned about the comic book connection, but I don't really care about the comic books; I loved this movie.  This has to be the greatest sci-fi action thriller of all times! If you are on the fence about buying this film, I'm telling you that you will not be disappointed!

This movie reminded me of his portrayal of previous characters, but mostly he just seemed flat.

Despite the casting issues, the movie is visually appealing and the special effects are usually great.  The movie, however, kinda plods along, and I get the feeling that Keanu Reeves would rather be somewhere else.

One bonus for me is that The Evil One looks a heck of a lot like my ex-father in law, and that seemed appropriate...but that's just a singular, personal bonus.  Seriously, this is a flawed movie, but it is worth watching.  I expected more, but the visual effects and several scenes compensate the viewer for the slower scenes and general feel of the movie.",1206230400,,1153,6.358974358974359
7761301,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Fortunately a few years back my son discovered comic books. At least the card sets that were coming out about that time. In so doing, I helped him to find out what was behind all of those cards and found myself immersed once again in the brightly colored world of comics. Except that I soon discovered that comics were no longer a children's art form but a whole other world of graphic storytelling and imagery that was unlike anything out there with the exception of film. Tales of heaven and hell battling it out for the souls of humans, secret government agencies that allowed people to extract revenge on those who had done them wrong and heroes that actually killed people because they felt it was in the interest of society were all present. And so was John Constantine.

The comic series HELLBLAZER was the story of John Constantine. And unfortunately I never found myself drawn to it. As written by Garth Ennis, it took on a legendary status among fans and helped to increase the popularity of DC's Vertigo brand, a home for more adult oriented comics like this and SANDMAN. When I heard it was going to be made into a film I was interested. And after watching this film, I may have to take the chance of picking up some of the trade paperback copies of the series.

The film opens with John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) being called to a tenement apartment where a young Hispanic girl has been possessed. With the knowledge he possesses, Constantine is able to bring the demon out of the young girl and send it back to Hell. But something was different here. It seemed that the demon was about to enter our realm and leave its own.

We are next introduced to a woman who dreams of another leaping to her death from the top of a building. It turns out it wasn't a dream at all and police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) saw the death of her twin sister. Called to the scene, she seeks solace from a priest later hoping that he will allow her sister to be buried in consecrated ground. At that time, her path crosses with Contantine.

Constantine is at the same church talking about the gamble between God and the devil which allowed them to put man's own free will at stake. Either side might try and influence the actions of man, but neither was allowed to be on this plane. Someone is trying to break that deal and Constantine wants to find out whom.

The one fault of the film is in assuming we know all there is to know about Constantine and his battles here on earth. It is at this point that we finally begin to get a glimpse of what transpired in the past as Constantine and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) discuss John's past and his desire to do good in the hopes of changing God's mind into allowing him admittance into Heaven.  More details of this transpire later in the film.

Eventually Constantine's and Dodson's paths cross once again and they are led down the road that will help them both discover who was behind not only the death of Dodson's sister but the attempt to enter this mortal plane as well. It's a long path that leads them both, literally, to hell and back, but the journey they take is one filled with danger, fear and a believable story that draws the viewer in.

The story itself here makes the film, offering a battle of good and evil on this plane that was formulated in the beginning with God and the devil. No balance of power is discussed, no self righteous name calling is produced, simply the battle that is fought is brought to our doorstep with all the souls on Earth hanging in the balance.

The weakest point is Keanu Reeves. While I enjoy his work and think of him as a more accomplished actor than many give him credit for, he seem far too Neoish here. After three MATRIX movies, I see him in black and think of him there once more. He does a good job, as does Weisz, but I still have that mental image of him.

The movie is well made with some great CGI effects that startle and frighten. The images of Hell are what one would expect as are the demons. But all are done with quality here.

CONSTANTINE may not be the greatest movie ever made. But it is one movie that will entertain while you watch. And it may cause a few conversations to rise concerning God, the devil, Heaven and Hell. What more could you ask for in a movie?",1205366400,,4291,4.3984867591424965

Music.  I bought the Soundtrack and it's one of my favorites.

Action and special effects.  Very well done.

Story.  It's from a comic book, people.  It's fiction.  Fantasy/horror.  If this isn't your cup of tea, then skip it!

Acting.  No matter what you think of Keanu, the supporting cast is very good.  I think Keanu was perfectly cast in this, but I can see where some would disagree.

This movie is pulp fantasy.  It's well done, and I enjoyed it immensely.  So much that I've watched it 2 or 3 times and I still want to buy the DVD.

The lead woman was a bit flat, and constantine wasn't as colourful as in the comic... partly due to Keanu's limited acting range (ie ""woah!"") but also because he was adapted for US audiences.

There are even serious plot issues... why exactly is the fabulous christian artefact... owned by the Nazis... to be found in Mexico?

But even despite its deficiencies, it's still a lot of fun - packed with great action, powerful scenes and a wonderful moody feel. Even the cheesy shots seem to work - eg Satan gloating over Constantine's imminent death, then receiving a finger for his trouble. and what a fantastic choice of casting that was ;)

7761308,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I suppose if I were a teenager again, this movie would be scary and I could entertain the idea of, ""What if the premise of the movie was real?"", but I am too mature for that kind of nonsense and there is nothing believable about this movie, especially the acting by Keanu Reeves. Every single movie that Keanu has been in, he has displayed the same exact mannerisms, stoic expressions, and delivery. The only Keanu cliche acting that was not used in this movie was the very well worn out, ""Whoa!"". Even the camera movements looked and felt like they were copied from The Matrix. Keanu is a very lucky person because he has always been in demand for the kind of these kind of movies that he has been typecast into and he has become a teenage cult figure. But in my mind, he just would never be believable in any other acting role, for example, Rachel Weisz is the exact opposite of Keanu in acting ability. She has an emotional depth and expression that makes her look and feel so alive, while Keanu has the emotional depth of a spoon. Keanu's apparently bad acting is distracting and ruins the movie.

Since the special effects are good and the storyline is okay, I decided to give this movie at least one star. I like ""demons exist"" and afterlife movies because of the psychology of belief, not because they are credible, and this movie does not disappoint me in that regard. I would recommend this movie for teenagers, but not for adults -- unless you are like me and like collecting these kind of things, even if they are not very good.",1198195200,2,1539,4.457446808510638

7761312,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Random thoughts on this movie...response to other reviews...

On Keanu Reeves: I went to see this movie because I am a Keanu Reeves fan and I enjoy him most in his action/fantasy movie roles than in his attempts at straight drama. While this movie is not as enjoyable as a ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" or a ""Matrix"", it is not the hopeless mess that so many Amazon reviewers have indicated. It is a solid 3 star (mid-range) movie.  It is a must-see and perhaps must-have for Keanu Reeves fans.  I might not watch this movie over and over again as I have watched the ""Matrix"" and ""Bill & Ted"" but I will definitely watch it again.

On the movie genre: I am not an expert on nor a die-hard fan of this movie genre. So my rating of this movie is intended for people who are not fans/experts on this genre, just ordinary movie goers like me. The antecedents of this movie -- that it is based on a comic book series -- are clear. Where else would such an arcane plot come from except the panels of a comic book? I like the fact that this movie does not take itself too seriously.  The movie is not produced with the extremely polished block-buster values of a ""Batman"" or ""Spiderman"" movie. I have no problem with that. Some movies with tons of money put into production become overly-polished and bland (the equivalent of waxed apples). I like my fruit and movies unwaxed.

On offensiveness to Catholics/Christians: No real Catholics or Christians were harmed in the making of this movie. The intent of the movie is neither earnest (e.g. ""Jesus Camp"") nor satiric (e.g. Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" or ""South Park""). Its usage of the Catholic religion is a plot device only, a prop. I could detect no statements, negative or positive, about real religion in the movie. Nothing in this movie will cause a Christian to become an atheist. That said, I will state the obvious: this movie is inappropriate for impressionable and/or sensitive children (younger than 10), regardless of their religious upbringing. It is the kind of movie that would have given me nightmares as a child. (I have amended my review to add the preceding caution statement because I am always surprised at the age of children brought to some movies by their parents. What are those parents thinking? Are they crazy?)

On why 3 stars: I would not have chosen to watch this movie if Keanu Reeves had not been in it. The biggest downfall of this movie is the script. There are no memorable scenes in the movie until the end. It was boring for short periods. The boring parts were never long enough for me to lose interest completely.  (I will not finish watching a thoroughly boring movie even if Keanu Reeves is the star.)

Another movie in which Satan attempts to take over the world, comedy, non-comic book: Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"", solid 4 star movie, starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dogma-Special-Edition/dp/B000053VAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dogma (Special Edition)</a>",1194393600,,3025,4.881091617933723

A well-made and well-acted if not entirely faithful adaptation of the popular cult DC/Vertigo comic book ""Hellblazer: John Constanstine"". It's a mix of H.P. Lovecraft-esque horror, fantasy and action combined with some dazzling special effects and an intriguing story, the main character is quite a complex and tragic hero that shows us the way to hell and heaven in this movie.

7761317,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Surprising new enactment of the sacrifice of a man who had always been in contact with the other side of reality in a vast fight against Lucifer to whom the world has been totally abandoned by God. And the sacrifice is supposed to save the world. Not by redeeming the sins of human beings. But by preventing the birth of Lucifer's son and the total take-over of the world by him. The strangest element is that everything is purely haphazard. There is no plan, no real perspective known and controlled by anyone, especially not God, and least of all Lucifer. It is pure opportunism on their sides and human beings are always taken in-between these two famously inconsequent and irresponsible characters and they have to accept, follow and suffer what the other two in their big conflict don't even know they produce. Even Archangel Gabriel is totally spaced out and corrugated and Lucifer will punish him by burning his wings and making him human and sensitive to suffering. Let's hope for eternity. The special effects are from time to time agreeable and pleasant but never really outstanding. The story is messy and obscure and the spear that had been used by a Roman soldier to pierce Jesus' side on the cross and had disappeared for some time reappears by pure luck somewhere in Mexico of all places. Nave. And we don't know at all what's the use of it and what it brings to the story. The second coming of Lucifer's son is a failure. The second coming of some Jesus, new or old, is also a failure since Lucifer has to resuscitate him for him not to go to Hell for eternity. And they repeat as often as possible that He has a plan for anyone of us. In fact He and They have nothing for none of us. We are lost in a messy haphazard conflict between a truant God and a totally disorganized Lucifer. That's what divine providence amounts to: nothing at all.

7761319,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"NOTE: This review refers to the deluxe two-disc edition of the movie.  For some reason, Amazon just lumps them in with the regular edition.

I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I shelled out for the deluxe edition, if only because of the Hellblazer comic that's included with the package.  I was hoping the extras would add more in the way of explanations for some of what happens in the film, but they don't.  This is why the entire package loses one star.  Particularly aggravating is the commentary from Akiva Goldsman and the director.  Goldsman's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard.  I eventually had to turn off the commentary because I couldn't take the noise anymore.

7761321,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"""Constantine"" is a movie with one cool premise, and some serious potential. Sadly, I thought much of it was wasted and lost in the final product. While this does not make the movie bad, it certainly left me feeling that it could have offered more.

Basically, the story follows Constantine, a coughing, hacking and wheezing demon hunter, (he smokes too much), who is caught up in the cosmic battle between God and Satan when the delicate balance of power is upset. The shadowy agreement, which included no direct influence on humans, gets shattered and Constantine gets caught up in the whole thing.

The acting is pretty much the same as anything you would expect from Keannu Reeves, and most of the acting was of the same or similar quality. Peter Stormare's portrayal of Satan was particularly laughable.

The somewhat corny ending really did not suit the overall darkness of the movie and seemed to try and salvage something of a feel-good, ""good triumphs over evil"" message. I will not mention that ending for those who have not seen it.

""Constantine"" was an average movie, but as I said, it could have been so much better. The special effects were excellent and the visual feast was awesome. Beyond that, it barely poked above average. Not something I would consider adding to the collection, but sure worth a few bucks in hiring it.",1184371200,2,1340,4.787878787878788

The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is a great feature to enhance this otherwise thematic audio track: the dialog is as if spoken in the public library, and all of the demon encounters are as if you're smack in the middle of the action. That's just the style though, but this ""quiet dialog"" style is the sort of thing which makes me want to get it over with or go to sleep - one of the two...overall the movie does sound great.

The whole demon movie genre doesn't do much for me...never really did. The chanting, the touching, and the controversial symbols that bring out the people who like to make a big to-do about anything controversial - it's all too much for me. These are typical features which lend themselves to predictability, but if these elements aren't there, then it isn't a demon movie anymore - a catch 22. Does this mean that once you've seen this kind of movie you've seen 'em all? I think it does [for me].

The good news here is that ""Constantine"" is very modern, it's extremely huge in production value, and it has some awesome visual appeal that's fresh enough to make this movie quite an entertaining film.

There's tons of features form behind the story, to additional footage (deleted scenes), a music video, two feature commentaries by two groups of two of four different people, teaser and theatrical trailers, and an IME with Director Francis Lawrence.

Most negative reviewers seem to have it in for Keanu Reeves and they don't even list any specific points as to why they didn't like the movie.(One reviewer said that he didn't like the husky voice of female lead character, Rachael Weisz. Come on!)

Personally, I liked the surreal feel of the movie. The cinematography was excellent and cast of characters, Gabriel, Papa Midnight, etc. made it interesting.

It was also thought provoking. For example Constantine tried to commit suicide as a teenager and was clinically dead for two minutes. In ""real life"" would it really count as suicide since he was revived?

All in all this movie had great special effects, great scenery (Constantine's apartment was awesome!)and a fascinating subject matter. Watch the movie and come to your own conclusion!",1175040000,3,914,5.0

7761330,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I've read the comics and seen the movie many times. i don't care about their similarities nor their differences. all i care is that they were both entertaining enough to keep me coming for more. I loved the majority of this movie and even with gigantic plot holes i still found this movie to be a wonderful use of cinimatics.
in the theatre, this movie got hammered by the critics and aparently tons of people didn't like it either. I couldn't figure out why until i thought about the fact that i'm not religious and many people had problems with the overly-Catholic tone. Oh well, it has a Catholic background, it's still fun to watch.
Constantine's witty dry sense of sarcasm drew me in from the beginning because i just love that in characters and the only sarcastic character i think i like better is House, from the TV show.
i know this movie isn't for everyone, but if you have an open mind to all things magic, you will probably like this, unless the Catholic background throws you off. This movie only follows Catholic mythology so far, then takes it's own twists (I.E. Half-breeds). Personally, i thought it was great that someone could use the angel/devil mythology in a different way. A little originality goes a long way.
The hell scenes were quite possibly the best part (visually) to me in this movie. Those scenes just added a little extra flavor to a movie i would have liked anyway, but sent it to the top. I hope Keanu Reeves recieves more roles that would suit him well like this one.",1173225600,9,1503,4.549815498154982

Surprised at first but though maybe it was time that every movie doesn't have gratuitous sex scenes.  If you watch the extras you will see alternate endings which were cool.  You also get to see a scene where their was supposed sex with the girl with the tail.  You won't know she has a tail LOL until you see that deleted scene.

Downside is that the extra scenes are in bad quality, seem that they came straight from the reel.  Again, loved the plot and would love to see him reprise the role.  Gotta love Gabriel and the Devil!",1170201600,4,788,4.193333333333333

I'm not gonna tell you it's the best movie I've ever seen now but it's pretty cool when it's not too talky. I grew to like the characters introduced and I'm thinking that I'd like to see a sequel. I don't hate Keanu Reeves like so many others so I'd actually like to see him reprise the role again.

That being said, Constantine now has the distinction of being the first HD-DVD I've purchased and I'm just here to say that this is a sweet little disc. The picture is extraordinary to say the least. It looks so good that it makes the scenes with shoddy special effects look.... well, shoddy.

The sound is immaculate and the fact that you can access a wealth of special features as the film is playing just makes this whole new format awesome. Fans of the film will really appreciate this and I think even the casual fan would be impressed by this disc. I love the fact that you can go over the menus while the film is playing plus the fact that you can save your favorite scenes.

So, while there aren't too many titles to choose from on HD-DVD as of yet, this one is worth the purchase. I think it makes a nice demo disc for your home theater and besides, I can think of far worse titles you can start off your HD-DVD collection with. Recommended!",1167868800,5,1357,4.211538461538462
7761337,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Lately, I have been at peace with just how lousy an actor Keanu Reeves is.  Of late, I've been able to watch movies of his with my opinion of his talent secure--he will be awful, but since he's not such a bad guy personally, I'm not offended by the fact that he continues to get work (unlike such dweebs as Van Damme and Seagal, who are abominable at both acting and human being-ness).

I first came to this realization in _Matrix Revolutions_, aside from being awed by the innovation that occured with writing and directing for Reeves--Neo spends almost the entire movie being unsure of the meaning behind most everything he says.  Since this is Reeves when acting anyway, I found this to be a wonderful way to make his lack of skills work for a movie.

And all this let me sit back and not be bothered by his efforts in this film.  Granted, he has some 'tough guy' moments that are purely laughable, but instead I was able to get into the story despite him, and there are some real intriguing turns to this.  It would be tough to be particular about what impressed me about the storyline, for this would give away almost everything at the end, but I did like how the game between God and Lucifer for souls was played out here--how there are rules, and how neither entity is allowed to interfere directly in the human game of choice and assignment of the soul, but despite that there are some interesting moves and moves within moves to make the last 20 minutes or so of these really worth watching.

So, to sum up--Keanu bad (acting wise), story thoughtful, but you do have to sweat it out until the end to get to the really interesting stuff.",1166572800,4,1645,4.427152317880795

7761339,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"First of all, I've never read the comic, so if you're a a fan of the comic I would suggest other reviewers.

It wasn't a horrible movie.  It had some good special effects and the plot wasn't bad.  The plot has been outlined elsewhere, so I won't go into it.

If you're Christian (more specifically Catholic) and you don't like your religion messed with, you should avoid this movie.  They took some 'creative liberties' with Catholicism that may not be well received.  If I discussed some of the major liberties I might spoil the movie for someone so I won't go into detail on that.

It was a nice little diversion movie.  If you think too hard during it there are parts that just won't make much sense, so just sit back and enjoy it.

I felt that the biggest distraction in the movie was Keanu Reeves.  His character was engaging and Reeves did well, but he wore black the whole time and there were times during the movie where I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching one of the Matrix movies.  Well, the ""world within a world"" stuff was deja vu too, but...

All in all, it's not a bad movie.  It's not a ""WOW!"" movie either, but I didn't feel it was a waste of time.  It is definitely a movie that you would want to rent before buying.",1164844800,2,1243,4.278969957081545

The major upsides were the fact it had some pretty good ""cool guy"" lines every now and then as well as some pretty good visuals, but there were, of course, the downsides of blasphemy, confusing things like ""half-breeds"" that I don't recall having any place in even the stories of demons (much less the harbored beliefs), and a few other things...

7761341,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'm sorry, for the great job that was done on special effects and the ravaged story that was originally told in the Hellblazer comic book series, this movie could have still been better if not for the completely awkward and based solely on ""what Hollywood wanted"" casting.  Keanu Reeves has done some decent work in a few of the movies I've seen, but he was not the right guy for the part of John Constantine, nor was Shia Lebeouf the right guy for the part of Chaz Kramer.

The character of John Constantine, in the comics, is a weathered englishman with a horrible smoking habit who incurs the wrath of heaven, hell and earth alike with his efforts to protect the planet and in most cases, himself.  In my humble opinion, the right guy for this movie would likely have been James Marsters, Spike from the Buffy TV Series.  The character of Chaz, again, in the comics, is an old friend of Johns that has been through the wars with him, and most of the time not without putting up a fight of his own not to be involved.  So having this young kid hanging on the coattails of the Hellblazer and wanting to learn the tricks of the trade was simply horrifying to the fans of the comic series.

The movie itself was nicely done, Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton were both great in this as were all the peripheral people who helped make the movie an enjoyable is not somewhat tedious (for comic fans hoping for something closer to the comic) watch.

And please don't misunderstand, I'm not a Keanu hater, nor do I dislike Shia, his Greatest Game Ever Played was a great movie, it's just here, in this particular instance, I think that Hollywood should have tried a little harder to keep to the formula that made the comic such a success and they could only have done that with a slightly different cast.

If you see it, you'll enjoy it, the flaws are pretty apparent, but it still rates a watch, although I have yet to see it a second time.",1164585600,3,1932,4.407303370786517

What's incredible about it is that there is some really thought provoking material here. There is also some brilliant imagery, such as when Angela & Constantine are in the street as the winged demons are coming after Angela. There they stand in front of what looks to be a religious type store that's closed for the evening with a life sized virgin Mary in the window. There Angela stands in front of the virgin Mother, Mary's arms stretched out & Angela appearing right in the middle of her arms. Its not doctrinally or historically correct on many things, of course its a fictional story. There ARE some things, though, that are accurate or hint at the knowledge that is coming to light, archaelogically & historically speaking. They weave these things into the story seemlessly alongside the things made up just for the story. The ideas are interesting, the action is alot of fun, the artistry is beautiful, the character development is great, and the demons are downright scary (as they should be ! ) Its not a bubble gum type of movie. Its not just there to scare you. Its not there just to let you see things get blown up. You get these things, but you get alot more. One last thing I'll say is that there are a few things that I didn't get the first time around. It has ""replay"" value.

Keanu is miscast to the point of hurting the film and his performance as John Constantine should be considered a criminal act. I agree with everyone who have seen this film that Rachel Weisz does do wonders for this horrible film with her amazing performance but she is by herself in the good acting department and does not get a real actor to play with until the end where Peter Stormare shows up as the king of darkness himself but with only four minutes of screen time, he does not make an enough presence to give Weisz the support she needs to save this film.

See the film in order to witness a great actress who's trying desperately to save this film but other than her grant effort to give the audience something to watch, she's let down (as well as the viewer) by a badly written script and a leading man who can't act.",1155600000,7,935,4.4678362573099415

7761350,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"John Constantine sees demons.

He argues with them, dispatches them to hell, oh yes and occasionally even sleeps with them. He's a man on a mystical mission armed to his nicotine stained teeth with gold crucifix guns, chattering fright beetles and enough holy water to float even the Vatican for a month. Despite his laudable focus on ridding our Earthly plane of the foul miscreants, Constantine isn't a very likeable guy. He's not a noble priest exorcising a pea soup swilling teen of evil nor a sunny cheerleader who stakes Vampires. Constantine prowls the streets as a tortured, demon bedding, chain smoking rude guy who pretty much doesn't care anymore, because he really shouldn't even be here. His supernatural gifts are firmly tied up with his secret past, and those decisions both haunt him and drive him forward all at the same time.

Keanu Reeves is again the ""chosen one"", and trades in his Matrix sunglasses and black trench coat for cigarettes and a black suit.  Fans of his from the Matrix movies can't get away from the feel that this is Neo battling demonic forces instead of cybernetic ones.  However, Reeves performance is meatier and more confident and the ""whoa"" factor of his Bill & Ted days is thankfully missing here.  He may never win an Oscar, but he's a decent enough actor and likable enough to get him over the rough spots.  Rachel Weitz shines in a dual role and her depth as an actress is developing nicely.  Art design and the visuals effects in this film are stunningly beautiful.  When used judiciously and to serve the story, digital effects don't have to make a film look like an expensive video game and Constantine's visual FX crew should be praised.  We've seen glimpses of Heaven & Hell many times in movies and here they've been reworked yet again and effectively so.

Think of Constantine as a pumped up, action laden FX driven version of The Exorcist.  This film undoubtedly will never attain that classic level, however the philosophical issues of good and evil and heaven and hell are played here with the right mixture of seriousness and entertainment to satisfy any horror fan who likes films dealing in matters of biblical proportions.",1155340800,4,2183,4.810160427807487
7761351,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is an excellent and very refreshing movie; the plot is strong and good, the acting is fine, and the atmosphere and special effect done very skillfully. In the flood of recent movie production this title stands out - it doesn't need to catch your attention with streams of blood and gore as it became nearly mandatory and so common these days.

John Constantine is a full-time exorcist who takes on evil forces with great experience and talent. He was born with skills to be able to see the dark forces; in the childhood he regrettably attempted a suicide - a mortal sin that prevents him to enter heaven when he dies - so he dedicates his life to fight the dark forces, and also hopes that his achievements may help him to reopen his way to heaven. Anyway, during what seems to be a routine ""service call"" to treat a possessed girl, he encounters one of the unusual and more dangerous demons that are not supposed to be normally entering our world - and John Constantine senses that something bigger is up... his judgment proves right, and John has full hands to deal with the upcoming and quickly worsening situation... The strong part of this movie is the way how supernatural matters are presented here - sort of everyday' bread, casual stuff, and with certain dark humor underlying it - the exorcist takes himself half seriously, he's a chain smoking guy, he does his job but he's not the real ""hero"", he's more of a guy to do the job when needed and as he sees it fit.  The instruments of his trade and tricks he uses in his profession are ""casual"" as well and include a cat & bucket of water or an electric chair as travel devices to hell, his weaponry includes custom cast bullets, flamethrower built from crucifix, holy water sprayed directly or dispersed through the fire sprinkler system... I watched this movie twice few months apart and enjoyed it both times while being able to catch more story details during the second viewing.

Rachel Weisz does give the movie more than it deserved with her great performance but she's basically the only actor in the movie who knows how to act while the rest of the film is filled with actors who can't get past the horrible script that is making this the film as horrible as it is. I had never read the comic book but after a friend begged me to read it after I told him how disappointed I was with the film, I decided to check it out. To my surprise, the comic was not only well written but it was much scarier to boot.

heralds, and the people on Earth's role in the middle of it all. Trust

just comes a cross like an unlikable jerk than anything useful to the
story. He just sticks out like a sour thumb and just does not engaged
the audience with his badly written character. Rachel Weisz does far
more for the audience and the movie with her way too good and complex

awhile because the script and the dialog does not do her valiant

her character is way too lightweight to be taken seriously, especially
with the revelation towards the end of the film that just blows apart

decent kid actor but his character ends up more annoying than useful

Although he knows that he is already destined to spend eternity in hell for a mortal sin he committed in the past, John is still attempting to find redemption by dedicating himself to battling the demonic forces that exist just beneath the surface of our known reality and which have lately been making a greater effort to cross over from their world to ours.

I imagine that the Catholic Church must be rather pleased with this film,  especially considering the black eye it suffered at the hands of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code.""  Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.

Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, ""Constantine"" is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between.  In a role not all that far removed from the one he played in the ""Matrix"" movies, Keanu Reeves once again functions as the flawed Everyman hero whose job it is to save humanity from a fate worse than, in this case, eternal death.  We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path.  The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion).  The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But ""Constantine"" is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration.",1153094400,,1864,4.836477987421383

with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the

main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has

been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie

has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does

make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are

trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being

told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie

like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence

there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece

compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the

very best.

For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie one star.

7761362,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I saw this movie last year for my birthday, and I was so excited, because the trailer looked so promising. However, what I got was a mess of a movie and very, very, very mixed performances. I tried to justify this movie's shortfalls by focusing on its positives; however, the balance does not tip, it falls apart!!

First of all, the visual effects in this movie are horrible. It has a posted budget of $100 million, and I can't help but wonder where all the money went and how many starving children could have been fed and clothed. Bad special effects, however, cannot compare to the wreck that is Keanu Reeves. He is a tragedy of epic proportions, evoking feeling of sickness and uncontrollable laughter all at once! It is IMPOSSIBLE to take him seriously. I can't think about it anymore.

The positives are very positive, however. The storyline is interesting, intriguing, and attention holding; again, this only goes so far. Also, the supporting cast is superb. Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton are excellent in their roles and almost make you forget about the aforementioned tragedy (Reeves, for those who are lost). However, it is Rachel Weisz that makes this film bearable. She is beautiful, mysterious, and involving. I have read so many reviews that say she was too good for this film, and they were right.

Bottom line: you will beg for your 2 hours back, but Hounsou, Swinton, and Weiss (especially) soften the blow.",1151193600,4,1428,4.796747967479675

Mean time he, due to his accident he has the ability to see angles and demons. Even though he is conceited and knows where he will be going he still finds time to do some good for mankind and in the process send a few demons back where they came from.

Something has gone horribly wrong with the balance. And with the aid of his young sidekick and a medium that is well done by (Rachel Weisz) he intends to get to the nature of the problem.

The character of Constantine comes from the DC comic world and has been modified a tad to fit a movie with a beginning middle and end.

I could not help but notice Tilda Swinton who played Gabriel. She made you feel that you were watching a first class movie.

The only redeeming feature of value of the movie is not the movie its self but the audio track that explains wheat they are trying to do in the making of the movie. In fact you could just bypass the movie and listen to the voice over audio instead and save yourself two hours.

It's more and less a big budget version of the television show ""Angel"" but with out it's cleaver writing or it's interesting look at the war between Good versus Evil. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks coherency and certain scenes don't jell in terms of narrative. The only actors in the movie who manages to transient the bad script and misdirection of the director is Rachel Weisz, who does give the movie's only compelling performance and the great Peter Stourmare whose five minute cameo as the devil has more meat than the main character himself. Weisz and Stormare are about the only positive things that come out of this supernatural debacle and if the studio wanted to make good movie, they could have just focus their energies at Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare and have the movie revolved around their characters instead of the uninspired character of John Constantine and could have made a real and scary supernatural thriller.

With the advent of the new HD DVD players, movie studios are releasing movies in that format.  Some aren't even really changed at all, and those who purchase them are only getting a repackaged product that will allow them to place it on the shelves with the other HD DVDs.

CONSTANTINE is one of the movies that will really make an HD DVD system and surround sound system shine.  The movie is jam-packed with special effects that look great on an HD monitor.  Pausing the movie allows the viewer to look at a crystal-clear image that has to be seen to be believed.  The audio portion of the film will slam through the surround sound system.

Anyone who loved the movie but hasn't bought the 2-disc special edition of CONSTANTINE can pick this one up.  The HD DVD comes fully loaded with all the extras.

The story itself make absolutely no sense because it says one thing and contradicts itself latter with another, so you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time. Some characters serve no purpose what so ever like Constantine's kid sidekick who is as annoying as they come and the angel Gabriel, who is involved in one of the stupidest plot revelations to come out in recent cinema. A revelation that turns this movie's second half into a bad joke. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is pretty bad because instead of trying to help the story along, he just resorts to copying what was done before in order to get an effect and relying too heavily on the special effects to tell its story. You can see the influence the movie ""Seven"" had on him because of the way the lighting is done in some scenes but what he forgets is the fact that ""Seven"" had a compelling story that scared and held you in your seat until it's shocking climax while this movie will have you thinking on why so much had gone wrong with it in the first place. Acting wise, I will have to join the majority in praising Rachel Weisz for her performance because with out it, the movie would have been a bigger disaster than it is. Rachel Weisz give too much to this film with her performance and gets too little from it. Her performance literally keeps this movie from going under its own stupidly and she does make you think about her character as a real human being who is going though a crises of faith and a corrosion of the soul. She's so good in fact that she makes you almost forgive this movie but unfortunately for her and the people paying to see it, she is the only actor who is able to rise above the bad script and lousy direction to give a compelling performance. Keanu Reeves, who plays the title character of John Constantine is a decent actor when he is motivated but he looks like he's on some kind of drug in this film and does not come a cross well in his role. You don't really believe his character at all by the way Keanu plays him and the movie loses credibility because of it. You can't blame him for his lack of interest because of how bad the script is but he could have done better or they could have gotten a better actor to play the character instead.

The only amusement comes from Swinton and Stormare as Gabriel and Satan respectively.  Plus, Gavin (Bush's frontman) is creepy enough.  Weisz's performance is nothing special (her accent always stinks!).

As people have said the story makes no sense.  It is tentative in its storytelling... is this an action film or a religious film?  Problem is it fails to be either or both. The only grace outside of Stormare and Swinton is that the visuals are cool.

Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man condemned to Hell for trying to kill himself and trying to attain redemption by banishing demons back to the underworld.  I like Keanu, but most of the time he reminds me of Neo, his character in the Matrix trilogy.  And in the Matrix movies, he reminded me of his character Ted in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  The rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, was fine, the special effects were good, and there were even a few funny moments.

The acting is decent for a movie of this kind with Rachel Weisz proving once again to be one of the most versatile and talented actresses of her generation. Her performance is actually too good for this film because it demands a better showcase than this film. Her character is strong enough to hold this film by herself but with the inconsistent writing that is in the screenplay, she is reduced to carrying Keanu on her shoulders while he is trying to figure out on which film he's in.

He's miscast in the role of John Constantine and a better actor would have been able to show more of his sides than Keanu was able to do. Keanu just comes a cross as a jerk and that would have been alright if he at least showed some humanity but Keanu can't balance that out and he just comes across really bad. A better actor would have done more but with Keanu, you really can't expect much and you don't get anything here.

Keanu Reeves is a charismatic actor but his performance here misses the mark completely and noises dives into a brick wall. His performance lacks the presence that the character needs to make this story fly and that's a dangerous thing considering the fact that he's the lead in the film. The story itself makes no sense what so ever and the direction by Frances Lawrence is amateurish to say the least. By hearing the audio commentary by him on the DVD is to here a filmmaker who knows that he was in way over his head in directing this film and it shows by his bad decision making and his clear misunderstanding on what the movie really needed by his lack of experience. He copies more than he originates and lacks the understanding to know how to incorporate what he copied. Another factor that made this movie fail is the screenplay, that had no idea on what it was trying to say. It says one thing and then does a complete 360 degrees and does something completely different. It tries to be intelligent but can't hide the fact that it's really trying to make a supernatural dirty harry film that lacks brains competence, and good writing. Its was supposed to be another Keanu Reeves franchise but unfortunately it makes the last two really bad matrix movies look like cinematic art.

There are some good performances in this film that does try to respect the audience, and that's manly from Rachel Weisz (The Shape of Things, The Constant Gardener) who gives the only real and strong performance in the entire film. Her performance is way too good for this film, that's how powerful an actress she is and it deserved better than this.

His co-star Rachel Weisz not only has a more interesting character than he does but is 100 times more the actor he could ever hope to be.

It also does not help that his performance is as wooden as ever in this film, not to mention the fact that his character is more of a selfish jerk than a person that you can root for and not to mention the fact that he is also the most underwritten character in the entire movie.

7761375,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Sorry, I don't get all the bad reviews here about this film. ""Camp-fest?"" No, not really. Not at all. Maybe that's someone's wishful thinking?  ""Juvenile lesson in pseudo-Catholic salvation?"" Huh? Methinks perhaps the movie hit too close to someone's bone? It's an action thriller, and a very good one. Even the bad reviews about Keanu Reaves don't make much sense to me. Yeah, it's Neo again, and thank God, he's not doing any Kung Fu this time. Those Matrix movies deteriorated from the first one into the most dismal action films of all time. I rate the third one as perhaps the worst movie of all time, so it was fine with me if the original Neo cool is resurrected out of that ashheap in a fresh new universe devoid of all that spinning-off-the-walls kick boxing. So what if it's deadpan Keanu? It works. This character is a man who understands that life and the emotions are ephemera and are to be experienced mostly for their desperate opportunity, and that redemption in the end is a very iffy proposition, so yeah, he's not flexing the emotional muscle a lot-it's not on his mind. When the movie was almost over, it suddenly occurred to me that no kiss had taken place. Wow, what a fantastic accomplishment that was and how great that Keanu didn't insist on one being written into the script! That alone says something to me about Keanu as an actor. Do you think any of the other major male star's agents would have let a pucker on Rachel's thick blooms slip away? No gratuitous romance! Thank you! I get enough of that everywhere else.

On second thought, maybe I do understand the negative reactions and confusions of other viewers. You have to have some knowledge of the mythology that the Bible was initially built upon to understand the events in this movie--although of course, that mythology has been transposed in this movie--sometimes ridiculously as per the genre--into a comic book situation with a comic book main character. In this day when, for good or for bad, most young Americans probably know more about the traditions and details of Star Trek than the details of the so-called great books of their culture, it should probably be no surprise that the clues to meaning in this film are completely unfathomed by perhaps the majority of its viewers. Many of the Judeo-Christian references are probably no more comprehensible to many, if not most viewers, than if the details were based upon the Indian Mahabharata.

I found the film intriguing--a really fascinating play with the Judeo-Christian mythology. I've not read the comics, nor even seen them. Why would I need to? This is a tight script. The universe of fallen angels and a uniquely redeemed mankind in a rigorously ruled chess match where some are trying to cheat. This is pure Book of Genesis undertext with Miltonian coloring. This is the universe that bred mainstream American Christian culture. Like I say, you need to be Biblically literate to understand it. The Book of Job would be a good place to start, and Genesis, of course. You might even start with Milton's ""Paradise Lost."" It's all part of the Genesis ""myth"" as it has evolved to today. And then, there are a few details which come out of the ""popular"" mythology rather that the great book itself.

Being familiar with the mythology, I found nothing confusing about this plot, and no wasted imagery.  The special effects are spectacular. The direction is fine, and some of the acting absolutely superb. Tilda Swinton was a crisp delight as Gabriel (oh those wings!) and Rachel Weisz, yes, she was great as everyone says, but Peter Stormare's Satan was pure genius. People who think this film poorly directed should really study that Satan scene. That was a difficult character and very difficult scene to pull off successfully without flopping back on the stupid old overblown stereotype and required extreme precision by both actor and director to keep it original and as intense as it needed to be. Had a great, unexpected laugh in that scene too. Maybe Keanu's not the best of actors. I don't know, and wouldn't care.  Maybe he's the Gary Cooper of our day. Keanu carried me through this film from beginning to end and I enjoyed the whole trip, so he did a great job as far as I'm concerned. I was captivated by this fresh fleshing out of the Genesis-Revelations myth, much the same as, say, I enjoy the fleshing out of the vampire myths by Anne Rice. It gave it a tactile, up to date reality. A mix of ""The Matrix,"" ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""The Omen."" Terrific.

""Constantine"" is an entertaining and action-packed ride, and Keanu is a fitting lead actor for the part.  The main source of John Constantine's angst stems from a portion of Catholic doctrine that says that suicide is a mortal sin; thus, he is doomed to hell.  However, after committing suicide, he was allowed to come back and try to ""atone"" for his mortal sin in any way that he could.  This backdrop should allow anyone watching ""Constantine"" to appreciate the depth of the plot while overlooking occasional bad acting.

The plot itself was very intelligent, the powers (angels/devils) have complicated plots and plans which are clearly and imaginatively represented in the movie. Keanu Reeves is a great movie star, ok so he will never be regarded as one of the finest thespians in history, irrelevent - he brings a presence to the character of Constantine. Rachel Weisz (as we know now) is more than just eye candy, a talented actress she brings the right note of vulnerability and humanity to her character. Tilda Swinton's portrayal of the androgenous Gabriel was suitably delicate and surreal. All in all i found the film very enjoyable, i loved the twisted take on the whole Judeo-Christian mythology - God is probably not a nice guy, angels can be smug callous and vicious creatures, demons are badder than you know and the whole of humanity just puppets - very refreshing.

7761381,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I can't get why people review this particular item with 2- and 3-star reviews.  I mean, Keanu Reeves had already established himself as a great actor in The Matrix trilogy, while of course Rachel Weisz was the main reason that many people went to see the movie in the first place.  It was a great movie; I loved it.

Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ex-cop who believes that he is the only one who can stop an invasion of demons from taking over the world- and it helps that he can actually see the demons.  This movie contains a lot of supernatural material, the main reason why I saw this movie in the first place (besides Rachel Weisz, of course), seeing as I love supernatural thrillers.

Constantine's main focus is on helping skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister (also played by Weisz), and their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldy events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost. Constantine takes many trips to hell and back by going through a body of standing water (i.e. his bathtub, a pan of water).  There are also many sequences of demonic activity and language that almost makes a sailor blush, but I still loved this movie.

Once again, I complain that Amazon's review system only goes up to 5 stars; otherwise, this would be much higher-rated.  Definitely recommended for fans of sci-fi or horror movies.",1146009600,2,1583,4.81549815498155

See I'm no fan of Reeves and I actually think of him as a dry and predictable actor that always acts the same in every film. The stories he gets and his supporting cast is so good that they make him look even better and he gets a high price tag. Constantine needed an actor to play the character as a mean, intimidating, and vicious loner and who better to play that than a man who had that exact role in his previous films.

 So I don't see Reeves as a problem but why this film gets such low ratings could either be that it's not true to the comic like other reviewers suspected or it could be because it's not true to the history of the real Constantine. Whatever it may be with those who have the knowledge of the comic or factual history this is a good movie either way. The acting is nothing to be excited about but trust me that the movies perspective on good and evil are interesting enough to keep you entertained over and over again. It's got some scares in it if you scare easily and it may even have your mind twisted around it's concepts longer than you think.",1144713600,4,1195,4.191304347826087

The script itself is so poorly written that you will be astounded by some of the dialog that is spoken by the characters in this film and the plot really does not make a lot of sense once you try to put two and two together. Rachel Weisz does in fact give a riveting and haunting performance but she's the only actor in the film who dares to give one while the rest of the actors in the film fall flat on their faces with their one dimensional characters. (Peter Stormare does do well in his small but pivotal role but he's only in the movie for about three to four minutes) The visual effects are a let down compared to the films that have come out recently in the cinema and they get repetitive after a while. The direction is a joke with certain scenes that are shot so poorly that you have no idea on what is going on from scene to scene. A better director would have tried to make some sense on what was happening but this director only adds to the confusion that is already in the script. If you like to make fun of bad movies, then this movie is for you because other than Weisz's gutsy and complex performance, the movie has nothing to offer in the form of real entertainment",1144540800,7,1361,4.218390804597701

While all the actors did a fine job, the one that really captured me was Rachel Weisz, I became a total big fan of her after I saw this film, I'm serious. She was just SOOOOOOOOO good, her performance just plays over and over in my head. After I saw her in this film I know she'll probably get an oscar, or at least an nomination sometimes soon, and guess what? I was VERY right HA!

Okay, I REALLY DON'T get what's up with all the bashing of Keanu Reeves. I'm not a fan of him but seriously, there are much much worse actors out there. Just because he got famous in the Matrix doesn't mean he derserves to be labed as ""one of the worst actor in Hollywood"", he's a fine actor, and he has popularity, so you guys are not getting rid of him any time soon, get used to it OKAY?

Why did they cast Tida as Gabriel??? All through the film I go like: wait, Gabriel is a guy right??? Are they trying to follow up with the stereotype that angels are look feminish? okay... so just get a girly-looking guy, or do a girly-looking make up on a guy. 'Cause Tida as Gabriel in the whole film is a distraction to me.

The idea is pretty interesting, but I'm not a big fan of the whole ""God is righteous, Demons are bad"", and ""angel could be rebellious"" controversy. I don't need it shove down my throat, so that didn't make me enjoy the film as well as I could, but overall, it is pretty entertaining, so rent it or something if you have nothing to do.",1144454400,2,1555,4.142384105960265

The only thing in the film that is note worthy is Rachel Weisz `s performance and that's because she at least tries to bring a real sense of strong will and bravado to her role but outside of her game and too good to be in this film performance, the rest of the film is literally a disaster.

I enjoyed this movie, even though it seems overly 'witchy' to me: heaps of demons, demon-possessed people and references to the devil which I admit did have me feeling a little uncomfortable at times... but the special effects were excellent.

Keanu Reeves made a great chain-smoking Constantine, I think he played him well. I have always found Rachel Weisz incredibly annoying, she reminds me of a deer in the headlights. In this movie though, she gives a well rounded and credible performance as the woman who enlists Constantines help -her twin sister dies while in a mental institution and is written off as a suicide. Rachel's character refuses to believe this, since her sister was a 'good Catholic' and wouldn't take her own life because she knew she would go to hell if she did.

Constantine comes into her house, does this amazing thing where he goes to hell (via the eyes of a pet black cat?!) and finds out what really happened. Unfortunately this opens another whole can of worms (or demons as the case may be). There are some good subplots going on in there too.

I can't give it 5 stars because I felt the ending descended slightly into farce, normally this type of movie terrifies me but I found myself rolling my eyes, especially in the scene where Keanu lifts his finger to ""Luc"" (as in Lucifer), I found it incredibly implausible and glib.

But it was still a good way to spend a couple of hours.

I am a HUGE fan of Rachel Weisz, however, and while her talents were regulated to the ""greiving sister"", I thought the movie (plot and all, folks...) was enjoyable.

7761396,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Dreary action thriller that would like you to believe that its about something when it's really about nothing. Keanu Reeves gives another one of his great wooden performance as a supernatural detective who helps a cop (Rachel Weisz) try to solve apparent suicide of her twin sister unknowing of the dark forces that are at work. Safe to say that Keanu is ready to save the world again but when he does it, you don't believe a single thing he does because you don't believe him in the role. The movie would have been better served if they got an actor who would have played the role a bit more maturely and with a bit more feeling but Reeves just seem more like a cry baby than a man who know what he is doing and he just does not come across well in the role. The script unfortunately adds fuel to the fire with its unfocused story and lousy lines of dialog, which is literally over juvenile for a movie that has such dark themes.  The direction also adds nothing in terms of helping the movie out of its dilemma with way too many unfocused shots and too many unnecessary scenes that adds nothing to the movie at all.

There is some good in this movie and it comes from Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie's only stellar performance. She's so good that you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen while you know deep down that the movie is not as good as her performance.  Another good performance comes from Peter Stormare who is criminally underused in a bit part as the devil himself. His performance is ten times more potent than the lousy performance of Keanu Reeves as the lead and he's only in the film for about five minutes.

I don't know exactly what went wrong with this film but if the producers of the movie wanted to make a better film, they just could have cut Keanu out all together and just focus on the great performance of Weisz and Stormare. Add a director who knows what he is doing and a script that makes sense and you have a great movie there.

7761397,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"How do you take an amazingly simple concept like HELLBLAZER and turn it into a ridiculously mundane and uninspired movie? Just cast Keanu Reeves. Evidently, Warner Brothers thought that the success of the MATRIX was due to Keanu's acting. They failed to realize that most of the credit should be going to the Wachowski brothers for having the keen insight to cast Keanu as an emotionally vacant Kung Fu master. Keanu is really good at looking emotionally vacant. But when it comes to a character like John Constantine, it would have been nice to cast someone who can actually act.

For anyone that doesn't know it, this movie is based on a long-running comic book series by DC that revolves around John Constantine. Constantine is basically a modern-day incarnation of an old Raymond Chandler gumshoe that chases down demons instead of criminals. It's a great concept, which is why the comic book has a huge cult following. In the comic, John Constantine is a tortured, craggy, rugged man with white/blonde hair. The way that he's drawn usually makes me think of Rutger Hauer and Roy Batty.

This thing was doomed the moment they cast Keanu Reeves. It's not just the fact that Keanu's hair is black. I'm not that much of a purist. I didn't have a hissy fit when they cast Tom Cruise as Lestat. A little peroxide will do wonders for the hair color, but what Tom had going for him was the fact that he can act. Keanu, unfortunately, cannot. He's like the male version of Tara Reid. Keanu should really just resign himself to being a bimbo. He should just stand around and look pretty, that's about all he's good for. His acting is always flat and boring. The only movie where I remember actually liking his performance was Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. And that was probably because he was just playing himself... a stoner. And it was also probably because I was also like 6 years old when I saw it.

The movie itself has some good moments, and the storyline is vaguely interesting, but I really just couldn't buy Keanu as a tough guy. It's impossible for me to say whether this movie could have been better if they'd cast someone else as Constantine, because Keanu is on screen for most of the movie. His stoner voice is so distinct, it's really difficult to ignore. The storyline had potential, and the guy that played Papa Midnight was perfect, but every time that Keanu was on screen the movie just lost all of its momentum. So, whoever decided to cast Keanu as Constantine should be fired. He or she is single-handedly responsible for destroying what could have been a huge franchise for Warner Brothers.",1135814400,4,2613,4.676086956521739

Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeuof, Djimon Hounsou, Max Baker, Pruitt Taylor, Gavin Rossdale, Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare.

Running Time:  121 minutes

Rated R for ghastly violence, gore, and language.

The success of the ""Matrix"" films shot ""Speed"" and ""Point Break"" action hunk Keanu Reeves into another stratosphere of stardom.  His depiction as Neo Anderson in the celebrated trilogy showed more depth and ability than any other role that he had attempted in the past.  ""Constantine"" does not showcase his talents much like the ""Matrix trifecta, but manages to vividly extract every ounce of respectful acting that was once apart of him.  Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels.  Constantine, a combination supernatural detective and exorcist who is on the verge of dying of lung cancer from smoking, and is a complete jerk to anyone he meets.  He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out.

Decent yet very incoherent adaptation of the ""Hellblazer"" comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very poor performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two ""Matrix"" films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. Director Francis Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it.  Overall, ""Constantine"" had a good concept, but fails with its execution. To those who want intelligence in a movie, this film certainly strained a lot of the foundation from the comic book and crammed it with religious theories and random babble. Those who want mindless action and dazzling effects, ""Constantine"" succeeds by giving them just that. But in the end, there wasn't enough action to keep that segment of the audience's attention, and the depth the film supposedly had never really showed up.",1135728000,5,2627,4.900677200902934

Rachel Weisz does far more for the audience and the movie with her way too good and superb performance in this film but you do end up feeling sorry for her after awhile because the script and the dialog does not do her valiant performance any justice. Her performance is so good in fact that she is single handedly holds this film together while its in fact falling apart by all around her. Tilda Swinton plays a pretty good angel but her character is way too lightweight to be taken seriously, especially with the revelation towards the end of the film that just blows apart the little creditably this film had going for it. Shia LaBeouf is a decent kid actor but his character ends up more annoying than useful and Djimon Hounsou does ok with a very limited role.

In this episode (for we know this is going to turn into a film franchise, don't we, kiddies?...though how that will happen given some of the events in the film's closing half-hour I'm not sure), Constantine is contacted by Angela Dodson, a police detective (Enemy at the Gates' Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister recently committed suicide at the local mental hospital. (Odd point: when was the last time you saw a mental hospital as large as Ravenscar is depicted here?) Constantine at first refuses to help her, but changes his mind, and very quickly finds himself embroiled in extremely nasty events that put not only him, but his contingent of friends, in great danger.

The strangest thing about the movie is the portrayal of Constantine himself. Not only is he now American (and not smoking nearly as much as one would think Constantine would), but he's, well, a nicer guy. He's presented here as someone who understands the value of give-and-take, as opposed to the almost violently selfish Constantine of the graphic novels (and the film's portrayal makes some of Weisz' lines, while they're talking about Constantine's past, ring rather oddly). Still, the script jettisons kinder, gentler Constantine as often as needed, usually for laughs at the expense of Chas (Holes' Shia LaBeouf in what should be his breakout role), John's everpresent sidekick.

All that aside, the story has some semblance of coherence and doesn't wander off into too many distractions, unlike the comics upon which it's based. As I alluded to previously, some of the things that happen in the final scenes are going to make doing sequels rough if they have any intention of remaining faithful to the books, but the end is definitely set up for a Constantine 2.

Essentially, the story is great, the acting is mediocre, and the look is fabulous. The atmosphere is amazing, and I think the special effects suit the story perfectly. I love the concepts introduced through the story, but I've always favored the exploration of religious mythology.

As for the acting, I was actually impressed with Keanu Reeves--this is the sort of role that suits him, because he can be deadpan, and it will actually look good. Rachel Wiesz I was less impressed with, although there were a couple of moments where she was quite good. Overall, the performances are just unremarkable.

There are many small problems with the film, that I can't even name but simply know are there. Overall, I think it's just general cheesiness. It's a B-movie. The characters around Constantine are one-dimensional and mostly silly. There are a couple of moments that are just ridiculous posing.

7761413,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"So bad its funny adaptation of the Comic book Hellblazer is such a multi-car wreck that it's almost too bad to watch. Keanu Reeves is so bad in the role that he should be a comedian instead of an actor because almost all of his scenes in this film are funny. His deliveries of his lines are so bad that you can come up with better lines before he's able to say the dialog. He demeanor borders on stupidly and he's even upstage by the special effects, which are not very good to begin with. It also does not help when you have a script that is so unfocused and so badly written that you as a audience member can't suspend disbelief on what is going on right in front of you while you are watching it. It's tries to be a cool version of the Exorcist but ends up being more like John Water's Pink Flamingoes but with out the camp or the humor that movie had. There is a transsexual angel that causes the horrible climax of the movie to happen and a homosexual demon that has a grudge with our dumb hero but by the time we are introduce to him, almost everybody in the audience would have a personal grudge against Keanu character for how bad the movie has turn out.

Surpassingly, there is some good to be found in this film and that's mainly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, who is so good in this film that you end up wondering on why the movie turn out so bad in the first place. Weisz is such a strong and talented actor that she even kinds of makes you buy on what is going on with the story but that's a uphill battle even for her great talent to succeed giving the fact that her co-star can't act if his life depended on it and the fact that the screenplay does not do her performance any justice. She's the only rose in this big pile of crap that is worth watching and that's pretty sad considering the fact that if you had a screenplay and a leading man to compliment her performance, this movie would have been much better off that it is now.",1131580800,3,1961,4.160526315789474
7761414,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"""Cats are good. Half-in, half-out anyway.""

For fans of theological thrillers or graphic novels, there is something incredibly enticing about the character and adventures of John Constantine in the cult favorite comic Hellblazer. Seen by some as a powerful magician fighting against demons, and by others as a smarmy con-man out for a quick buck, the world behind the world that he inhabits is one ripe for a good mystery with a healthy dose of the bizarre.

The movie adaptation helmed by director Francis Lawrence and starring Keanu Reeves is more of an extrapolation of some of Constantine's comic adventures rather than an adaptation of the exact world and character. John Constantine is now a dark-haired american living in a demon-infested Los Angeles (mmmm, irony) instead of the snarky blond Brit that rowls the comic pages. However, the important things about his character remain largely unchanged. He retains the same pitch-black sense of humor and ""screw you"" attitude to the minions of both heaven and hell, and Keanu himself does an admirable job in the role. Perhaps it's just that John Constantine can be such an emotionally dead character, but Keanu does what is easily his best work since donning his trenchcoat and shades in the original Matrix.

The story for John is fairly simple; he sees dead people. Or rather, John Constantine has the rare ability to spot the semi-demons and quasi-angels (termed ""half-breeds"") that live among the human population. As a child, it drove him insane and desperate to the point attempted suicide. However, it didn't quite work, and now, knowing that he's destined to burn, Constantine acts as something of a bouncer for the city; whenever a demon tips the balance between good and evil by stepping too far outside the line, he deports them back to hell. he does this not for the sake of doing good, but in the forlorn hope that it'll buy him back into the good book.

This grabs the attention of Racheal Dobs, a detective who can't believe that her Catholic sister would comit suicide. Suspecting foul play, she enlists the unwilling help of Constantine, and the two start down a road to unravel an unholy mystery involving the Spear of Destiny, psychic powers, and ancient prophecies.

The story for the film is solid enough, but it's really the visual style and the supporting cast that make it enjoyable. Francis Lawrence creates a brilliant atmosphere for the film, along with some geniunely disturbing images of Hell, and does a great job of fitting each scene to its mood, whether it's being defined by performances or music.

As for the supporting cast, they're all incredibly enjoyable. Gavin Rosdale and Tilda Swinton provide great contrast as Balthazar and Gabriel, and Djimon Honsou does a great mystery man as the militantly neutral Pappa Midnight. Even the usually annoying Shia LeBeouf is palatable, and in actually adds a lot to the character of John Constantine. As author Niel Gaiman proved in The Books of Magic, Constantine is most enjoyable to watch when he has a young charge to act as his foil. And watch for a scene-stealing performance from Peter Stormare as the Morning Star himself.

Overall, the film isn't meant to be much more than an exercise in entertaiment with a heavy dose of the macabre, but it manages to be very good at what it does. With very effective use of effects and visual style, along with solid performances, if you like your supernatural thrillers with a touch of the hellish, this is where you should look.

And the two-disk DVD is easily the best deal if you're planning on picking the film up. It has all the special features that the one-disk edition comes with (including some deleted scenes that actually might have improved key points of the film), but also a full second disk of extras looking into the making of the film. It also comes packed with some selected Hellblazer comics, for a look at the original vision of the Constantine character.

Constantine has a different sort of feel overall than something more fun and self-aware like Hellboy, but it's certainly worth a look if you enjoy films like The Devil's Advocate or The Exorcist. Just come in expecting something. . . different.",1131580800,4,4202,4.88218793828892
7761415,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"You know Keanu was OK when he was a kid with his 'Bill and Ted' stuff, but starting with Speed, I thought of him as nothing much more than a buffoon. I just find him annoying.

Well this flick is about angels and devils and how neither can enter our world but can only 'whisper in our ears'. Well Keanu attempted suicide as a boy, went to hell for two minutes and then came back to life. Now supposedly he's doomed to hell because suicide is a cardinal sin in the Catholic Church. So no matter what he does in his life he's going to hell. You will hear this no less than 20 times in the movie. So he's trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to hell through exorcisms.

Well we get a lot of explanations like how the Bible in hell tells a different story in Revelations. You got Satan's son being born, Gabriel trying to kill it, demons made of flies and snakes, and a voodoo witch doctor bar owner who stays neutral.

If I may put forth a little bit of opinion. The dude who played Satan was the worst movie Satan I've ever seen. An old bald man is bad enough, but why was he dressed in a white? Like a heavenly white? I wasn't expecting horns, a pitchfork, and a red suit, but this is supposed to be Satan for crying out loud. With the money they spent on special effects, they could have at least delivered a frightening Satan. His demons were fifty times scarier than the Prince of Darkness himself.

Well in a nutshell, Keanu still can't act and special effects carried the movie.",1131321600,2,1502,4.2229965156794425
7761416,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Seems reviewers are picking on Francis Lawrence, blaming him for the flaws, (and in my opinion, this film has none), of Constantine.  But for a high octaine action/horror flick like this, Francis Lawrence did extreamly well.  Not only did he have a good eye for the visuals, (Hell as a twisted mirror image of our own world, brilliant), but he even got a great performance out of Bush lead singer Gavin Rosdale.  Francis Lawrence also did a good job holding onto the intricate plot, letting loose the surprises at just the right times.

In the end, if this film has an fault at all, it's that it was released a few years too late.  With Keanu Reeves in the lead, and filled to the brim with computer generated effects, it's inevitable that Constantine will be compared to The Matrix, all though I believe Constantine, and I know I'm in the minority here, is better.",1131062400,,865,4.590909090909091
7761417,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"...what the heck, why can't I at least sort of like this movie?

The first time that I saw it (yep, bought it before I saw it) I wasn't so sure.  I think in part because I didn't have the volume turned up very loud, and I missed a lot of what was being said.  Also, I've never read the comic book(s?) that the movie is based off of, which made me even more confused.  This past time that I watched it I turned on the closed caption so that I wouldn't miss anything, and that helped out quite a bit.

As other reviewers have noted, the storyline is simple enough: John Constantine is trying to help prevent the Devil's son from being born on earth and terrifying all of it's inhabitents.  The special effects are incredible, and I really enjoyed the many visual aspects of the movie.

The acting is, well, not the best.  I get a kick out of Keanu Reeves, but not so much because I think he's a good actor - more just because it's sort of entertaining watching him make sort of a stooge out of himself trying to look all tough (he was perfect in the Matrix - he was supposed to be the confused guy).  Rachel Weisz (Angela/Isabel Dodson) was by far (in my opinion) the best actor in the whole movie, and the only one who came off as believable for the whole movie.  Gavin Rossdale (Balthazar) is flat out laughable.  He tried to be all mysterious and evil, but he comes across more as seeming like he's in a stand-up routine in which he's trying to convince Barbie that he's far cooler than Ken doll.  It's unfortunate, because his character could have been so much more sinister.  Peter Stormare (Satan/Lucifer), on the other hand, did have the subtleness of his evil played out perfectly and he really came across as terrifying; in a charming way.  Tilda Swinton (Gabriel) was a mixture of good and bad acting: she was fine intially, but the very last scene where she's telling Constantine just how 'well he's doing' is just pathetic.

I think that I can understand why this movie has had so many poor reviews - many parts of it are awkward and too long, with other parts not being explained well enough for someone unfamiliar with the story.  But I think this movie is alright, in the best sense of the world.

Theologically, the movie is strong at parts and weak at others.  Suicide as always damning is not biblical, and the whole half-breed thing is also a stretch - I found the way that Gabriel, one of the Archangels in the bible, was portrayed as basically evil was unfortunate.  However, Angela is right - you can't buy your way into heaven!  Let it be clear though that I'm not trying to say these are really negative marks against the movie - this movie isn't about theology, it's about entertainment...enjoy!",1130976000,2,2718,4.430583501006036
7761418,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is yet another movie based on a comic book that even most comic book nerd hadn't heard of.  So they take the story of John Constantine on the pursuit of riding the world of demons because of something long ago that bars him from the gates of heaven.  It's extra important to get in now because a large chunk of the residents of hell were put their by him.

In the role of the title character is Keanu Reeves who will forever conjure up the thoughts of Theodore Logan no matter how serious the role.  Needless to say, the slacker surfer persona doesn't mesh well with the demon hunter.  On his quest in the movie, Constantine crosses path with the chick from The Mummy movies as a detective trying to prove that her twin didn't commit suicide.  And because ever good comic book character need a sidekick and Constantine has a cab driving apprentice played by the dude from one of the Disney Channel shows that I won't admit to watching.

One of the few entertaining elements of the movie is the unintentional comedy most notable being every moment where Reeves tries to act, and be sure to watch out for Constantine's rubber ducky.  Equally questionable casting choice was the dude from Bush showing up as the bad guy.  It was extremely hard to be scared of him because whenever he comes on the screen I fell off the couch laughing.

The only redeemable aspect of the movie was the scenes of hell.  They really captured what I assume hell to be, a very hot version of Earth with weird demon ready to rip the flesh.  The only part missing from my version of hell would be the members of the Backstreet Boys raping me for eternity while singing their songs.  In fact all the special effects were all well done.  Now if they can figure out to make a CGI Keanu Reeves and the movie might have been a lot better.

The biggest crime of the movie is that they cut out what could have made the movie.  If you role through threw the delete scenes you find out about Constantine's tryst with a very hot (bad pun intended) half-demon who was cut out of various scenes in the movie.  If I were to ever make rules of making a good move, number one would be ""Never leave out the token hot chick.""  Because of that, this movie deserves to fail.",1130630400,,2240,4.3825665859564165
7761419,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I have no familiarity whatsoever with the graphic novel upon which this film is based, so I can only address the film in and of itself.  And I must say that I rather enjoyed it for the most part.  Anything with angels and demons always interests me, and this film put a quirky spin on the agents of God and Lucifer.  Since John Constantine seems to be a pretty tight-lipped fellow who doesn't reveal much of himself to anyone, Keanu Reeves seems like a pretty good pick to play the part - there's not too much acting required for this one.

So what's this all about?  Well, John Constantine has this gift (or curse) to see and interact with creatures from both heaven and hell; he's already been to hell and back once - literally - and therein lies his biggest problem.  Since he did commit suicide, he's not eligible for a ticket to heaven later on - and this second life he was given is hurtling toward an impending end thanks to all those cigarettes he's chain-smoked for years.  He's content to go his own moping way, dealing with particularly difficult exorcisms when called upon and generally just bemoaning his awful fate.  Then a female cop (Rachel Weisz) shows up asking for his help; her sister supposedly committed suicide, but she doesn't believe it.  Both Rachel and her sister were pretty special, for they could also see the things Constantine sees (although it takes some rather intense training for Constantine to reawaken those abilities in his new, temporary partner).  It soon seems obvious that something big is going down.  More and more demons are trying to cross into our world, violating a big treaty between God and Lucifer (who would have thought that demons couldn't be trusted?), and that just doesn't bode well for anybody.  Before you know it, special effects are coming at you left and right, and the birth of the Antichrist is almost at hand.

Now, you're probably thinking that old Mr. Pitchfork himself is behind the whole Antichrist thing - but that ain't necessarily so.  The movie manages to throw in a couple of small surprises toward the end (although it certainly breaks no new ground in showing Lucifer as a really stupid being).  I really hated the characterization of the angel Gabriel, though.  First off, I just don't see Gabriel as a woman, but more importantly, this Gabriel comes across as a far from superior being.  This isn't the first time we've seen a Gabriel who hated and conspired against humans (out of jealousy), but Constantine's Gabriel is a far cry from a similar archangel in, for example, The Prophecy.

The plot of this movie isn't all that bad, but it could have been told much more effectively.  If you're not into this kind of weird subject matter, you may look upon the story as little more than an excuse to throw some impressive special effects together.  I'm giving Constantine a somewhat tentative four stars, but I'm sure there are a good many people who won't enjoy the film very much at all.",1129680000,11,2967,4.680154142581888

The huge problem that this film has is of course Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the point of the film becoming a joke and the screenplay is way too incoherent to understand most of the things that are happening in the film. The lackluster dialog seem more like a USA cable film that a real movie that was releases in the theaters and the special effects don't hold any ground what so ever and they get repetitive after a while, losing most of it's attended impact along the way. Some of the other actors in the film don't even seem to care about their performances with the excerption of Rachel Weisz, whose game and way too good for this type of film performance does more for the film than it should have. She actually makes you care and understand her character and makes her a real three dimensional person who you would have liked know more about and follow instead of the tissue paper dimensional character of John Constantine and his fellow lackeys. Another actor who does way more than he should have is Djimon Hounsou and he does not have enough screen time to make a better impact as well as Peter Stormare, who great interpretation of the King of Darkness is just in the movie for about four minutes.

7761421,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is a movie that I believe you will have to be a genre fan to enjoy. There are several inside jokes and pokes at other sci-fi movies, not to mention comic book theology.

On the whole, the movie does take itself seriously, but I believe that's what makes it so campy and fun.

After the movie was over, I spent my time watching the 2nd disk commentary, and then watched it again. As you can tell from what I'm writing, I enjoyed it.

But as I said in the title of my review, you're either going to love it or you're going to hate it. If you're a sci-fi/religious fan, I'd recommend it. If you're a general audience type person who wants to know what the hubbub is all about, you might not necessarily enjoy it as much.

Is Keanu Reeves' performance as monotone as it is in every flick he does? Sure. Does it really detract from a fun movie? I don't think so.

7761425,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Sometimes it mystifies me why a group of people will all go out and get ID's so that they can write exactly one negative review of a film.  Constantine seems to have managed to outrage both the Hellblazer comic book crowd and the and the 'this is blasphemous' club.  After all, Constantine is intended as light entertainment, not scripture or imitation.  So let's just take a look at the film in and of itself for a moment. After all, if a film arouses this much antipathy there must be something to it.

In John Constantine's (Keanu Reeves) world evil and good are locked in the age old struggle, but there are rules that the two sides play by.  The big rule is that true demons and angels cannot cross over to this plane, although there are plenty of what Constantine refers to as 'half-breeds' to make up the difference.  Constantine is something of an enforcer.  If demons get to out of line, his job is to whomp on them and send them back to hell.  How did he get the job?  It seems that when psychics commit suicide they run the risk of being both damned and restored to a job with no opportunities for advancement.  To make matters worse, John is dying for the second time - from lung cancer.

Something is wronger than usual - trash scavengers have uncovered the spear of Longinus, there is unrest among the minions, and a woman commits suicide who never should have.  The woman's sister, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a detective determined to understand how the tragedy could happen.  Before long Dodson and Constantine are working together and they find themselves faced with not just a few souls out of place, but a rebellion in hell that threatens to drop all humanity into the end of days.

Reeves creates a Constantine who is more taciturn than the Hellblazer character, but whose grit and brusqueness still make him an interesting figure.  Weisz has more script and she fulfills her part as a foil for Constanine beautifully, This is a film which is decidedly un-sexy, regardless of the attractiveness of the leads.  The bit characters - half-angel Gabriel (played by Tilda Swinton who captures the angel's ambiguous sexuality perfectly), half-demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), Midnote (Djimon Hounsou), and Beeman (Max Baker) - all have a crisp, comic book reality.  And Peter Stormare does an outstanding job as Satan twisted in a whole new fashion.

Director Francis Lawrence does a notable job of capturing the feel of comic book illustration and framing within the parameters of film.  The film is carefully balanced between comic book sarcasm, humor, and the horrible seriousness of the underlying theme.  Putting everyone's 'issues' aside (and everyone seems to have one issue or another about Constantine) this is lightweight but well constructed piece of filmic fiction.",1128729600,3,2797,4.848421052631579

Keanu Reeves is a charismatic actor but his performance here misses the mark completely and noises dives into a brick wall. His performance lacks the presence that the character needs to make this story fly and that's a dangerous thing considering the fact that he's the lead in the film. The story itself makes no sense what so ever and the direction by Frances Lawrence is amateurish to say the least. By hearing the audio commentary by him on the DVD is to here a filmmaker who knows that he was in way over his head in directing this film and it shows by his bad decision making and his clear misunderstanding on what the movie really needed by his lack of experience. He copies more than he originates and lacks the understanding to know how to incorporate what he copied. Another factor that made this movie fail is the screenplay, that had no idea on what it was trying to say. It says one thing and then does a complete 360 degrees and does something completely different. It tries to be intelligent but can't hide the fact that it's really trying to make a supernatural dirty harry film that lacks brains competence, and good writing. Its was supposed to be another Keanu Reeves franchise but unfortunately it makes the last two really bad matrix movies look like cinematic art.

There are some good performances in this film that does try to respect the audience, and that's manly from Rachel Weisz (The Shape of Things, The Constant Gardener) who gives the only real and strong performance in the entire film. Her performance is way too good for this film, that's how powerful an actress she is and it deserved better than this. The next good performance belongs to Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Brothers Grim) whose interpretation of the devil is pretty inventive but he's only in the last eight minutes in the film.

What a shame that this movie could not have been any better because it has some potential especially with the stellar performances of Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare but with a director who was in over his head and a screenplay that had no idea on what it was doing, it's no surprise on why this movie turn out this bad.",1128211200,10,2272,4.593596059113301
7761429,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"John Constantine is one character that you'll have fun watching over and over. I own this dvd and I'm glad I do. As many comic book fans probably already know John Constantine can be a man of mystery not just a man of the occult. He has many faces and shows in several different comic book plots in different forms. Overall, Constantine is a rough talking, rough riding, antihero we love to love. Is Constantine a villain or a hero? I don't think he fits into either category well because he's a mixture of both yet contains something more than those choices can provide. In this movie, you see the hoodoo believing, demon destroying, antihero Constantine. Constantine just wants to go to heaven and be done with the perils and pains of earthly life but fears that only Hell awaits him. He committed suicide as a teenager because the so-called gift of seeing demons felt more like a train wreck through fire. So Constantine decided to end the whole mess and got a first class ticket to Hell where the fire seers you to a crispy corpse.

Constantine was brought back only to forever remember the glimpse of hell. He even has a one way open invitation back to Hell as soon as he dies. Now that's the kind of bargain no one wants. So Constantine basically spends most of his time sending demons back to Hell and fearing his beat down for doing it once he reaches Hell with them. His quirky sidekick Chas (who looks deceptively younger than he's supposed to according to the comic books) is played by Shia Labeouf. Shia does a good job in here for the little screen time he has but he proves himself to be worth watching. Midnight played by Djimon Hounsou looks so cool! He gives a great performance for his short screen time and adds a deeper flavor of coolness and masculine drive that powers the seriousness of the storyline home.

I would suggest this movie for anyone who wants to see Keanu Reeves managing to make a decent Constantine. You won't be screaming in anger at this one, you'll want to get those cool tattoos on Keanu's forearms and chant, ""Into the light I command thee!"" over and over. Most importantly watch this movie if you want to know how to go to Hell just to see what it looks like. Constantine will show you how to do it, it involves a cat, some water.....hmmm anyways, watch to find out.",1128124800,6,2310,4.484560570071259

Keanu Reeves plays his regular wooden self helping Rachel Weisz try to save the hell-bound fate of her twin sister who committed suicide.  He has special powers to rid demons from earth and spends most of his time walking through the movie coughing up the results of years of smoking.  The story is simply Reeves trying to balance good and evil between God and Satan on earth.  He seeks out those old good-evil, angel-devil half breeds.  Some of his encounters are digitally amazing.  The story is mildly entertaining, but the effects are truly inspiring, if not nauseatingly inventive.  Reeves makes frequent trips to hell and the scenery is spectacular.  Tilda Swinton also makes a cameo as angel Gabriel who tells Reeves that basically, he is f***ed!  It's half funny and half scary.

Keanu Reeves is so bad in the role that he should be a comedian instead of an actor because almost all of his scenes in this film are funny. His deliveries of his lines are so bad that you can come up with better lines before he's able to say the dialog. He demeanor borders on stupidly and he's even upstage by the special effects, which are not very good to begin with.  It also does not help when you have a script that is so unfocused and so badly written that you as a audience member can't suspend disbelief on what is going on right in front of you while you are watching it. It's tries to be a cool version of the Exorcist but ends up being more like John Water's Pink Flamingoes but with out the camp or the humor that movie had. There is a transsexual angel that causes the horrible climax of the movie to happen and a homosexual demon that has a grudge with our dumb hero but by the time we are introduce to him, almost everybody in the audience would have a personal grudge against Keanu character for how bad the movie has turn out.

Surpassingly, there is some good to be found in this film and that's mainly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, who is so good in this film that you end up wondering on why the movie turn out so bad in the first place.  Weisz is such a strong and talented actor that she even kinds of makes you buy on what is going on with the story but that's a uphill battle even for her great talent to succeed giving the fact that her co-star can't act if his life depended on it and the fact that the screenplay does not do her performance any justice. She's the only rose in this big pile of crap that is worth watching and that's pretty sad considering the fact that if you had a screenplay and a leading man to compliment her performance, this movie would have been much better off that it is now.",1127692800,4,1964,4.160526315789474

Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.

Only Rachel Weisz come out of this mess with her dignity intact because she brings more to the movie and her role than she really needed to. Her performance is actually way better and much deeper than the movie itself and she and her character would have been better off as the lead in a better film than this because they are both the only real and complex thing about the entire movie. It's like she's the only real person in a computer-generated cartoon that should have been a real flesh and blood horror thriller instead.

It feels like a weird dream you can't wake up from that makes you really
look at the feelings/actions in your own life that you fear.

I don't know the comic book and I don't believe in Heaven and Hell. WE create that in our own lives,
and we get stuck in it. I feel that's one of the themes in this film.
Many of the demonic images of fiery worlds of suffering  we create for ourselves.

Not every culture shares these images  or punishing beliefs.

Keanu Reeves is brilliant in this movie. The characters he plays are almost
trance channelers for other realities -
like Kabuki players or Shamans.

I love how extreme this film is. There is a fluid energy that the characters move in
and out of that is also disturbing and intense.
There are a lot of films  and tv shows now  about the occult and psychic phenomena and
spiritual experiences.
CONSTANTINE is a fascinating journey into our fears and beliefs.

I give Keanu and all the actors and Director high marks in excellence to go into
these dark and murky places that already exist within us. Awesome movie !",1127433600,3,1145,4.492753623188406
7761438,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"The premise behind Constantine is terrific. A downbeat cynic with a grudge against his creator is given the power to help maintain the balance between good and evil on earth in an effort to ""buy"" his way into heaven.  That says a lot since most of us who do have faith pray with basically selfish motives, then act as though we're doing it to glorify God. Also, I thought the concept of Constantine's smoking captured mankind's affection for spite in a very clever and funny way. Add to that the idea of ""half-breeds"" living among us and ""the wager"", and this movie is, theologically, darn interesting.

The problem with Constantine, like so many other big-budget hollywood productions, is that it tries to satisfy all audiences by blending all genres.  Sometimes that works, but not here. Constantine is not scary as a horror movie, and it's humor works more in its recurring gags than its intended comic relief. Granted I never read the comic book, but even if this is a faithful adaptation, a seasoned crew should know what wouldn't work in a transfer to the big screen. Comic relief characters are overused anyway, being that they distract more from the story than they add to it.

Keanu Reeves was a good choice for the lead, but the show is nearly stolen by Tilda Swinton's gender-bending Gabriel.  Always classy and fun, Tilda injects the most vitality into Constantine despite her only being present in three scenes! She and Gavin Rossdale appear to be the only ones smart enough to not take their roles too seriously.",1127433600,3,1526,4.765151515151516

Rachel Weisz co stars as Angela Dawson a , how can i word this, customer of Constantine, whose twin sister commited suicide, and wants to find out the truth behind her sister's death.

  The movie will keep you entertained right from the beginning exorcism scene, where COnstantine delivers what I consider a memorable line-""This is Constantine. John Constantine. A**hole.""

  Reeve's portrayal Constantine is very good, despite being different from the actual character from the Vertigo comic series. Weisz's performace is very good, her best since ""Runaway Jury"".

The special effects are very good. The fight/ battle sequences are well choreographed, and I can safely say that ""Constantine"" has a very different and interesting incarnation of Hell- a highway that looks like an atomic bomb was detonated there, rather than the standard firey cave.

The movie is very well done, and is Reeve's best since 1999's ""The Matrix"". If you are looking for an anti hero, or a good movie to watch on a Saturday night, then ""Constantine"" is it.",1127088000,2,1228,5.105

(most of this movie is based off of Dangerous Habits((by Ennis))  although it goes back some plots from issues 1-10 and some other various parts of the 200 plus saga of Hellbalzer....) Yet, from the word go hollywood is able to take from the simplist things and just throw it all away.  First off what was wrong with Contanine being British????  Aye, this film was overall aimed for the American audience but, when has it been bad to have a british character???? More or less never.... Americans love british people more than Keuna Reeves... Seriously Hollywood more or less had two of the best comic book writers in the last thirty years to take from on this story and they just threw it away and went with what they thought was good.....And to top it off right before this movie came out DC made an offical version of this to be adapted to comic format and still scenes were cut and made differently before it went to the big screen....As, if to just rub salt in the wound that hollywood can't even follow it's own rules... For those who know nothing of Hellblazer or Constantine this movie can be outright confusing because the director assumed you've read the comic series which was a critcal mistake because this is a rather complex character.  Not, that it's impossible to make a two hour film on a long series comic character. Look to Spider Man 1 or Conan....Both took a well know character and took the basicness of what made them good and made a good film on them....As to those who gave this movie a 5 or 4 rating regardless of what they know about hellblazer are unfortinatly idiots that think Krull was great or Ghostbusters 2.....

The characters were very interesting.  At the start, I thought Keanu miscast, but he grew on me. I enjoyed the point the Reeves's character made about believing in the devil. The heroine says, ""I don't believe in the devil."" Keanu replies, ""That's too bad. He's believes in you."" The truth is the truth no matter what you believe.

7761443,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"In the world of ""Constantine,"" a lurid, bloodthirsty, stupid walk in that strange Catholic world of angels and demons, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) has the gift of seeing said demons and angels on the earth as they apparently wage war for Earth. He's pretty tortured by it, and once, before he knew his seeing was a gift, he attempted suicide, was dead for two wags of a dog's tail, and, well, even though he lived, he's destined for hell for merely attempting a mortal sin. He's also graced with the knowledge that he's destined for hell.  The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) tells him so. That's a helluva thing.

 So cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) walks into John's life. Her twin sister was a mental patient who climbed to the top of a skyscraper and swan dove. That being a mortal sin - now she's in hell. Angela wants to go in hell herself, and has to immerse herself in a tub of cold water to do so. ""Whatever you do,""  John says, ""don't close your eyes."" Eventually it's John, the cop, and Gabriel vs. Satan (Peter Stormare) and the lead singer from Bush in a holy rumble.

Modern comic books and the movies about them are a lot more obsessed with anti-heroes - think ""Spawn,"" ""Sin City,"" ""Blade,"" and ""Hellboy"" -  than they are heroes, and ""Constantine"" is firmly in that category: Good may prevail, but it does so in a way that credits evil.

John Constantine running around using crosses and other religious items was not believable because he didn't believe in God. He cherishes and has faith in created religious objects but has no faith in God. This is equivalent to making a movie about Spiderman but not having him get bitten by the spider, or making about about Luke Skywalker without him using the force. Constantine's holy incantations seemed like a bunch of voodoo mumbo jumbo. Anyone who knows anything about the bible should know that if you are going to make a fictional work off of it, at least get the core principles down.

Chain-smoking John Constantine sees demons everywhere, real demons. That sets him up with a great job as hired-gun exorcist, which gets him into and out of lots of interesting scrapes. He sees the angel Gabriel, and sees Hell as well. It's an up to date story in the heaven/hell/demons tradition. For me, it works well as an action story even though the pseudo-Catholic mythology doesn't.

Reeves is Reeves, with his usual angst-laden running around and monotone voice. The pleasant surprise was Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. The role is vaguely androgynous, a good match for the gender-bending in Swinton's earlier ""Orlando."" She did a good job with her few appearances, and generally rose above the ordinary script she was given.

If you like the demons-on-earth genre, you might find good entertainment here. Unless it's truly exceptional, though, an exorcism movie's premise just never grabs me. I came away from Constantine un-grabbed.

Some say that this actual idea that all the world is at a war has been already used. So what? The potential of this kind of plots, just like the luck of the Irish, will never run out! And when you see the way the movie is done, you are sure destined to compare every other similar movie to this one!

Everything in this feature is almost flawless. Every aspect from casting and costume design to special effects is done with such confident skill that you find yourself literally dissolving in the movie's atmosphere. It's just so believable it's nearly impossible, if you know what I mean.

Furthermore, I guess, the real success of the movie is that if you don't know it's based on a comic series, you'll have absolutely no idea that it's so. This work takes the story on an entirely new level, where even those who have never seen a comic book can appreciate the really fine idea brought to us by the really talented crew.",1125273600,18,1386,4.319230769230769

It has action, drama, even a little romance plus great characters (acted well, too) and some far-out cultish creatures, symbols, and history.  It's just one of those movies that is so in-depth you can really see this other world the author (of the comic) and directors have created.

Definietly worth watching again and again.  As for the extras, the second disk is very good, especially the part on ""Constantine Cosmology"" (I enjoyed because Constantine is related to the Hero Cycle of Joseph Campbell, if you are familiar as I am in my learning of mythology).

Perhaps the trend of tranfering comix books into big screen

movies has begun to play itself out. And its time for Hollywood

to find some fresh material to use.

 In my estamation this movie was poorly concieved and directed. I've have read one or two of the Hellbound books. They are

fairly good. (If your into catholic guilt that is!)

 But sometimes whats just so so on paper, can be really good

on film. I was hoping this would be so with Constantine.

 Sadly I was mistaken. Keanue Reeves performance was nothing more that a wise cracking version of his charicter in the Matrix.

 I have two suggestions.

1. Save your money and buy or rent much better movies.

Such as the oringinal 60's film ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris

and Claire Bloom. or ""Rosemarie's Baby"" with Mia Farrell.

Or the overlooked mid 70's flick ""The Sentinal"".

2. Please Keanue, find yourself some better roles. and get out

of the ""Matrix""!",1124928000,4,968,4.588235294117647

He is so bad that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance. The script is so poorly written that you will be astounded at the dialog that is spoken by the characters in this film and the plot really does not make a lot of sense once you try to put two and two together. Rachel Weisz does in fact give a riveting and haunting performance but she's the only actor in the film who dares to give one while the rest of the actors in the film camp it up to the point of nausea. The visual effects are a let down compared to the films that have come out recently in the cinema and they get repetitive after a while.  The direction is a joke with certain scenes that are shot so poorly that you have no idea on what is going on from scene to scene. A better director would have tried to make some sense on what was happing but this director only adds to the confusion that is already in the script. If you like to make fun of bad movies, then this movie is for you because other than Weisz's gutsy and complex performance, the movie has nothing to offer in the form of real entertainment.

Hats off to Rachel Weisz for at least doing her best with what was giving to her but I can't say the same for the movie itself.",1124928000,2,1442,4.091872791519434
7761465,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Well, movies about angels and demons don't push my buttons.  Lately, I haven't had too much patience with Keanu Reeve's work.  But I was surprised to discover this movie was enjoyable.

Best of all was Rachel Weisz.  She is an underused actress working in films today.  Which is a shame because she is fun to watch and very generous with her costars. Her role as a detective discovering a hidden talent and investigating her sister's murder was very believable.

Reeves is a very reticent and private actor.  Not many of his female costars break thru with him.  Moss almost did in the Matrix films.  But in this film, Keanu perks up and responds to Weisz whenever she enters the frame.  They have fantastic chemistry and it was great watching the emerging relationship between their characters.

Rachel Weisz brings out the best in Keanu Reeves and I hope that they work together again.  If it has to be a Constantine sequel so be it.  But a comedy would fit them both very well.  Reeves has shown himself to be a deft comedian in the past.  But he has been avoiding the genre. And Weisz lit up the whole Mummy franchise.

The rest of the cast was fantastic also.  Shia LaBeouf is turning into a very nice actor,Dijmon Hounsou is a blast as a witch doctor, Tilda Swinton is eerie as an angel gone mad and Peter Stormare just rocks as the Prince of Darkness.  Also, will someone use Pruitt Taylor Vance in a good role already!  I know his eye trick is fascinating but he is a great actor also.

The special effects were wonderful and some of the scenes were quite beautiful.

The script makes no sense what so ever and the direction is a joke. The dialog is so poorly written that you can't really believe what you are hearing from time to time and the setting is so dark in places that you can't see damn thing from time to time. Of all the actors involved with this crappy film, Rachel Weisz has the hardest role in the film because not only does she have to make you care about what is happening with her story, she has to pick up all of Keanu's acting slack in order for you to even feel something for his selfish and miserable character.  She is like the majority of the reviews have said over and over again the best and only good thing about this movie. Another shot out goes to Peter Stormare, whose brief appearance as Satan is the only bright spot next to Weisz's great performance that makes the movie somewhat watchable.

Other than the efforts made by Weisz and Stormare, the movie is a huge misfire and not even their great performances could have saved it from itself.

7761473,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Pretty bad horror thriller that insults the audience more than it entertains with a screenplay that feels like a rough outline of a story instead of an actually screenplay for a movie and some pretty unimpressive special effects and bad performances. I think Keanu Reeves is a pretty good actor but his performance here was less than desirable and he does not come across well at all. I think it's more the fault of the screenplay more than his effort because most of the actors in the film don't come across well at all with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who is not only the strongest actor in the film but the only actor that manages to transcend the horrible script with a gritty and complex performance that is way too mature for a film of this nature. If the movie was as good as her performance, it would have been a great film hands down but with only Rachel Weisz being able do to more with her character and her performance than the movie does with itself as a whole, her performance is the only good thing this movie really has. The rest of the film not only does not know what it wants to do with itself but also does not have a real narrative to steer the film to where it wants and needs to go. You end up more confused with the film's purpose other than to have any solid storytelling to keep you interested in what is going on and that where the major problem lies because you end up in the same place you started when the film ends where you were in the beginning and that's not the way any movie should treat its audience",1124668800,2,1539,4.273972602739726

Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character was fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several story lines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written. Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time. I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original.

7761475,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine was an unusual character for a comic book, which explains why the DC/Vertigo comic book ""Hellblazer"" was rather unusual, so it is not surprising that this 2005 film is a bit different as well.  However, ""Hellblazer"" fans may well find the changes in the character to outweigh the fact John Constantine has been brought to the big screen and be disappointed.  But then they already know that from having seen director Francis Lawrence's movie in the theater.  What are left are those who never read ""Swamp Thing"" or ""Hellblazer"" and are drawn by Kenau Reeves being in the film to check out the DVD.

Basically, what those viewers need to know about the hero is as follows.  John Constantine became involved with the occult when he was a youngster, and has always had a problem in that he was never really as good as he thought that he was.  Being cocky and brash works well when you are making deals with the minions of Hell, but can be problematic when you are trying to exorcize demons from little girls.  But Constantine can do magic, although he usually exaggerates what he is actually capable of doing and the legends about him are more impressive than his actual accomplishments.  He also happens to be dying of lung cancer, so whatever he is going to do in this world he has to ge done relatively soon.

The tagline for ""Constantine"" encapsulates the characters situation as: ""Hell wants him.  Heaven won't take him.  Earth needs him.""  We eventually get a glimpse of Hell, which is, visually at least, an ongoing nuclear firestorm that constitutes a memorable modern version of Dante's Inferno, but for most of this film Hell is in the shadows.  Constantine (Reeves) has been busy sending half-demons back to Hell when he is not busy smoking himself to death, but now full demons are showing up on earth.  This is a violation of the agreement between God and Lucifer, so something big and bad is brewing.  The focal point for Constantine's investigation is the sudden suicide ofa mental patient, whose twince sister, Angela (Rachel Weisz), is a police detective (andt therefore a professional realist who will have trouble believing what Constantine has to say).

""Constantine"" is more of a horror film than a comic book film, even with the set-up of the title character as something of a superhero.  Cinematically it is clearly going for more of a sense of film noir than we normally get in either genre, which is an interesting and effective visual style (previously Lawrence had done only music videos).  Unfortunately, the characters and plot are not up to the images (this is another movie where the best special effects pretty much show up in the trailer).  The problem may well be not just that viewers have to be brought up to speed on the character of Constantine in a way that is unnecessary with the first rank comic book heroes such as Batman and Spider-Man, but that you have to have more of an appreciation for Catholic theology than you get from having read ""The Da Vinci Code.""  The again, the Bible tends to see that great battle in terms of black and white, while the world of Constantine is pretty much gray (with blood red splatters).  After all, the angelic Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) does not seem particularly nice for a heavenly being (which gets us back to your understanding of Catholic theology) and not that different from Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale).

Then again the problem could be as simple as the casting of Reeves as the reluctant hero dealing with his curse.  Reeves has a definite look in this film, but it is not the look of John Constantine.  More importantly, the character is too different from the one in the comic book.  Granted, you have to have read ""Hellblazer"" to know that, but I am here to argue that the caustic S.O.B. of the comic book would work better in this storyline than what Reeves provides, especially when Satan himself (Peter Stormare) shows up for a chat.  Whether he intended to or not, the way Reeves plays Constantine is just too much like Neo in ""The Matrix,"" which is wrong on several key levels.  Still, given the visual strengths of the production and the way Keeves wants to go with the character maybe the greatest fault with this movie lies with the basic story that Kevin Brodbin came up with (Brodbin and Frank Cappello did the screenplay) from the comic books written by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis.  There should have been a better way of making this all work.",1124582400,,4451,4.708387096774193

The movie presents itself as religious farce, but is simply too disconnected to achieve anything even remotely resembling coherence.  We are led to believe that demons actively battle angels on earth; yet, at the same time we are told that they cannot cross over.  We are provided with disconnected images involving various occult practices, including the use of water as an occult lubricant to facilitate travel to the other world, as well as the use of an old electric chair, formerly used to fry criminals, now used to achieve occult transcendence.  The journeys of the main character to hell are unconvincing, and the plot is virtually nonexistent.  Apparently, the Spear of Longinus, the spear used to pierce the side of Christ as he lay dying on the Cross and believed to give its bearer control over the destiny of the world, makes an appearance; however, the role of this occult relic in the main storyline seems contrived.  The movie claims to be based on Catholic theology, but entirely neglects the role of Purgatory in the process of Salvation.  Lucifer also makes an appearance, but his bare-footed character is not at all how I would imagine the Prince of Darkness.  God does not appear in this movie!

Then when this happens you can't tell when the movie starts to pick up.  Then, no matter what happens in the movie you don't care and it becomes a long boring escapade.  None of the characters interested me because I didn't think any of them were well done and as I said before, it needs to explain some stuff earlier in the movie and when that doesn't happen the more unexplained events that go on just add on to those before, so you stop trying to keep track of it all and that's when I stopped caring.

7761484,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"For fans of the comic book on which this movie is based -- ""John Constantine: HELLBLAZER"" -- it will doubtless be a disappointment. I myself am an avid reader of said comic, and when I think of how much better the movie could have been...SHOULD have been...it makes me a little sad. For one thing, the John Constantine of the comic lives in London, not Los Angeles, and this is a critical difference, both for the character and the story. Constantine is supposed to be British through and through, and turning him into an American -- even worse, a Californian -- just destroys the whole foundation of the character. Putting a gun (a crucifix gun?) in his hand puts the final nail in this coffin...the John Constantine I used to read about never used guns.  He never had to.

The storyline they chose to adapt is one of the best of the whole series, the ""Dangerous Habits"" story in which Constantine, a lifelong smoker, is diagnosed with lung cancer, and spends the rest of the story wrapping up his affairs on Earth before taking the trip he knows he is destined for.  The movie adaptation, however, borrows only slightly from this story and then throws a bunch of predictable Hollywood crap into it to botch it up. It looks like they tried to mix the subtleties of ""Hellblazer"" with the over-the-top action of ""Blade,"" and the result is a hodge-podge mix of horror and action which really doesn't fly -- at least, not in terms of what John Constantine's followers from the comics might expect. ""Hellblazer"" is, in the end, a character-driven story more than an action story, and there's precious little character to be found in the film. And, if you know and love John Constantine as I do, the last shot of the film will leave you, as it did me, cursing at the screen in rage.

Taken on its own, if I ignore the comic for a few moments, the film isn't a bad one.  The effects are well-done, and the story clips along nicely.  The visions of Hell were detailed and gruesome, and I appreciated the effort that went into them.  Keanu doesn't fully convey the nature of the lead character, but he also doesn't lapse into his usual lazy style -- not a single ""whoa"" moment to be found in the whole movie!  The real star, for me, was Rachel Weisz, as Angela.  She pretty much stole every scene she was in, and was clearly the better actor of the two leads.  Another highlight in terms of acting was Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel, trapped on Earth and giving Constantine advice on how to redeem himself.  Swinton lends a cold, androgynous quality to the angel which was quite remarkable.  There are also a few really good ""gotcha"" moments, especially for Constantine, moments when his character did glimmer through a bit.

Basically, ""Constantine"" is a good action movie with horror overtones.  Those going to see it expecting nothing more than this will likely be pleased.

However, those seeing it hoping for a decent adaptation of the comic book are going to be let down in a big way. This Constantine has an American accent, he uses lots of guns, and he isn't as blithe or as harsh as he could be.  In short, he's not OUR Constantine.

And that last shot in the film...oh, I could just spit fire over that one.",1123718400,6,3217,4.547660311958405
7761485,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Terrible action/horror movie that puts on a lot of hot air but lacks a lot of brains and substance to pull off the story its trying to tell.  Keanu Reeves was just the wrong man for the job and his performance is that bad. You just want to smash his faces of the people who though that he was right for this kind of role. You just don't take him seriously and you end up laughing at him more than being intrigue by his character. His co-star Rachel Weisz not only has a more interesting character than he does but is 100 times more the actor he could ever hope to be. She not only gives the film's best performance (a performance that has more life and complexity than the film itself) but is the films only redeeming quality. You actually want to spend more time with her character and pick her brain on the life she have lived and the sister she has forgotten instead of the mindless dribble that the film because after the second act. Her story would have made a much better and scarier horror movie but of course this is a Keanu Reeves movie, and we have to suffer with a script and a director who will cater to his limited needs as an actor. The director has some talent with visuals but he has no idea on how to put a actual film together and the screenplay is so unfocused that you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time.

Worth a look for Weisz's efforts but don't hold out hope for a film as good as she was.",1123718400,3,1436,4.125

Keanu Reeves fumbles so badly in his role, that you do begin to fell sorry for him. Yes, he has his charm and his moments but his character is just a whining little boy and the screenplay does not help him endeared himself to the audience with really stupid dialog and plot holes so big, you can drive a truck through them. The special effects are good but repetitive and the direction needed a lot more dazzle for me to buy what was going on in the movie.  The only actor here who does make this movie bearable is Rachel Weisz and she is literally holding you attention by herself while you are tempted to turn off the Dvd player. Her performance does deserve better than the really bad movie she is in and deserves the praise it's getting because she does try to make you care about what is going on in the film.

7761487,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,I for one actually quite enjoyed this movie. I agree that you are going to either like or hate this type of movie full of CGI the old worn out good versus evil plot and an actor in Reeves who is hated as much as he is admired. I for one am in the first group and think he does very interesting movies that suit his acting style and the characters he likes to play. Constatine is loosely based on a poupular comic book about a man with a special gift who is trying to redeem himself in order to get into heaven. Along the way he meets a detective who badly wants to avenge her twin sisters death and they work together batteling evil with allot of interesting characters on the side. I think critics of this movie took it too seriously. Purists think it ripped the comic book off when in fact it makes me interested in tracking it down. Second the Heaven versus Hell plot while done a million times is done well here with a few viewpoints I can actually find intriguing. The special effects are excellent and the pacing of the movie was good as it wasn't too short like some of Fox's horrendous adaptations of comics like Daredevil(which got saved by a GREAT director's cut) and Elektra. I enjoyed this movie even if the subject matter is a little tiresome to some I found it to be fun. Shine on!,1123632000,3,1295,4.2682926829268295
7761488,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Let me say this up-front: I'm a huge fan of the ""Hellblazer"" comic book, especially the long run by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon. So I was more than a little nervous about this movie. But at the same time, I also like films like this, even when they're not connected to any existing franchise.

""Constantine"" feels like it both took too little from the comic books and not enough, which is a neat trick. There's likely a heck of a good movie on the cutting room floor or, more likely, in previous versions of the scripts that were sliced and spliced together to make the theatrical version of the film.

Keanu Reeves plays LA detective John Constantine or, as he says it, ""John Constantine, a-hole."" That's a cute line, but it points to one of the major problems with the film: It's Schwarzeneggerized. Dialogue in the movie, for the most part, consists of clever catch phrases (and we know ""John Constantine, a-hole"" is a catch phrase because a riff is done on it by another character within the first minute of Reeves saying it in the movie). Is he an a-hole? Hard to tell: In the comics, he certainly is -- John Constantine in ""Hellblazer"" will sacrifice small children to save a city, or sell someone else's soul for a marginally improved chance of defeating an enemy. In the film, Reeves' Constantine is mostly just moody, but we never heard him say ""I'm Neo, a-hole"" or ""I'm either Bill or Ted, a-hole"" in previous movies, despite his Constantine not being dramatically different from any of his other roles. But it's a cute line, so we're stuck with it.

In the comics, these clever bits that Constantine says are spaced out over several issues and we see a lot more of his street level grungy street magic. He's not a cool guy, he's a failed human being who happens to pull a rabbit out of his hat and save the day, once in a while, but at great cost to everyone around him. In the movie, we get all the cool bits and none of the context. This is Neo in wool instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality.

Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically ""Hellblazer"" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences. As a result, the actual plot of the movie comes suddenly at the end, and it feels as though most of what came before was unneeded, and it probably was.

Having said that, the film looks like a million bucks, whether it's cinematography, special effects or costuming. You can certainly see where they spent the money they saved on having a solid script doctor come in and clean things up afterwards.

Those interested in the subject matter -- a war between Heaven and Hell in a modern urban landscape -- would be better advised to pick up the Ennis/Dillon ""Hellblazer"" paperbacks (all of which are available here at Amazon) instead. ""Hellblazer"" fans would be advised to rent this, at most.

Someone, someday, will make a great gritty supernatural thriller set on the mean streets of London. ""Constantine"" isn't it, and isn't even a particularly satisfying appetizer for that film.",1123545600,,3237,4.599653379549394

Like Constantine's ability to go into hell and then return twice baked.  This movie is watchable once.  There isn't anything in this movie that would compel me to watch it again.

7761490,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is the story of a demonologist/exorcist who was born with the unique and uncanny abilities to see and combat demons(and angels), and other creatures from hell. The story begins with the finding of the ""Sword of Destiny"" - the sword that was used to spear Jesus Christ on the Cross at Calvary - and ends with John Constantine battled none other than Lucifer himself.

Constantine moves along at a good pace and provides an immersive story that will keep you engrossed. There are grand battles with flying demons, and a good working chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Rachal Weisz. Overall, you will walk away from Constantine having been entertained as well as glad you stepped into the fictional world of the ""Hellblazer.""

There are some weak spots to the film. Keanu Reeves was generally very convining, but had moments (especially when he was smoking cigarettes) where he seemed a little off. There were also some blatant inconsistancies that can leave the audience scratching their collective heads. For example: in the first 45 minutes of Constantine, John Constantine is continuously smoking cigarettes, and we are shown (quite often) the severity of his lung cancer. Then, for seemingly no reason, this character issue is forgotten. There is no hint of cigarettes or lung cancer until one of the last scenes.

Despite these odd defects, Constantine is worth viewing.

Horror, action, great characters, some eye-candy (Rachel Weisz on top form), demons, angels, mad special effects, a deep plot that sucks you in the minute you look at the screen, and an overall intriquing idea for a movie.

Keanu plays the part of John Constantine, a thirty-something man who can see demons and angels. He commited suicied when he was a teen and went straight to hell - because it is a mortal sin. But then he came back and has worked for god, sending all the demons and ""half-breeds"" as he can back to hell. By doing this he hopes to get into heaven because he is doomed to die of lung-cancer.

Rachel Weisz can also see certain things, as did her institutionalised twin sister. Its when her sister commits suicide that Rachel meets with Keanu to see if she did in fact commit suicide.

I won't go any further with the plot, you will have to enjoy it yourself and rent out the movie.

I would recommend watching it twice at least. The plot is so deep I found it kind of overwhelming at times. The first time i saw the ending i didn't really understand what happened.

Good acting by good actors and pretty nice movie to watch, quite a bit of action but doesn't go overboard but again a good thing because nowadays, younger viewers are all crazy for a lot of explosives etc, which I find now to be a bunch of bs and nothing that makes you think much, guess thats why the average IQ is so low now.

7761502,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I missed ""Constantine"" in theaters and thus looked forward to discovering for the first time via home viewing a quality motion picture adaptation of a popular comic book character.  And, in the end, I did enjoy the film.  Just be warned that it isn't like the ""Spider-Man"" movies.  Unlike those earlier films, ""Constantine"" is more interesting and intellectually stimulating than exciting.

In particular, I enjoyed the film's somewhat subversive vision that the goals and objectives emanating from Heaven and Hell are sometimes laced with the same base political motivations that are often the springboards for the official positions held by powerful organizations here on Earth.  I liked how the bad guys could be charming and somewhat sympathetic despite their Hellish origins, and how the holy characters (I'm mostly thinking of Tilda Swinton's Angel Gabriel character here) can come up with questionable and truly bizarre plans to rid the Earth of evil, even if it means something close to apocalypse has to result in the meantime.

The film skillfully mixes several genres and flavors (horror movie, detective thriller, and romance story among them), which successfully results in an entertaining whole.  It's just not a wildly entertaining whole, and you'll probably have more fun disecting the movie with a friend afterward over a beer than you did when you were watching it.

I bought the two-disc special edition, and the extras on the second disc are very well done.  In fact, if you don't know much about the Constantine character beforehand it's perfectly safe to watch the first couple of featurettes on the second disc before you watch the movie; they discuss the comic book origins of the character and the goals the film makers had in adapting the character to the screen.  These featurettes don't give away any major plot points and may make it easier to appreciate the film a little more when you watch it.  As a John Constantine novice I wished that I had watched those extra features first; I would have gotten more out of my first viewing of the movie.

Still, I enjoyed ""Constantine"".  After all, one has to have a soft spot for a movie that suggests that even death isn't an escape from the mundane bureaucracies of daily life, that one just trades dull rules and regulations administered by earthbound bureaucrats with mundane rules and regulations administered by angels and demons.

The story makes absolutely no sense what so ever and it manages to go against itself in certain parts of the film and the climax literally destroys the entire film with one of the worse plot twist in recent memory. The direction lacks focus and certain scenes either go no where in terms of furthering the story along or are just so badly put together that you have no idea of what is going on from time to time. The acting is not very good either, with Keanu Reeves not only degrading the role of John Constantine with his stare into space demeanor but he manages to make it into a poor mans version of Dirty Harry with the delivery of his lines. He is either trying to channel Clint Eastwood into his performance or a he's a mentally retarded man who is the butt of a very cruel joke by the studio who made this film. The only decent piece of acting in this film comes from Rachel Weisz who gives way too much talent and grace with a performance that is way too deep and complex for a film that is this poorly made. Her haunting performance could have been the basis of a much better and complex horror movie and that would have been a film that I would have liked to have seen other than the train wreck that is this film. The other great performance belongs to Peter Stormare, whose three-minute cameo is a classic.

Other than Weisz and Stormare, The bad word of mouth for this movie is justified.",1123027200,3,1837,4.355685131195335
7761512,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"The American consumer public are no fools. We know how to spend our dollars wisely, where to invest and what to avoid. So when this Francis Lawrence-helmed apocalyptic ""thriller"" topped weekend box office charts during its initial release, there's no way that money could've been directed towards the wrong feature, right?

Yes and no. Let's start with the yes and get it over with. First off, very impressive visual effects. From the exorcism in the beginning of the movie, to our little hero's ventures into hell, to the wings of Gabriel. (Btw, it is very interesting to note how Gabriel is depicted as genderly ambiguous) Rachel Weisz has a very smooth way to her acting, as if she can do it so easily and flawlessly, you actually believe her character as an L.A. policewoman haunted by the mysterious death of her twin sister. Shia Laboeuf has a bit of a minor role, but he makes the most of it, shining with that unintended humor of his character, Constantine's ""slave"" chaffeur, Chas Kramer.

Now, the no part. Hollywood seems to love declaring Keanu Reeves as our savior, the hero who didn't want to be a hero, called upon to save the world in one way or another. Whether it be in the machine-run era of ""The Matrix"", or a police officer trying to stop a madman from doing terrorist deeds in ""Speed."" And now, again, Reeves is called upon to save us from a clash between heaven and hell! John Constantine, a reluctant hero who has selfish ends, feeling sorry for himself, blah blah... Reeves may or may not put his all into this role, but as we all know by now, his best is never good enough. Constantine's persona is too flat, not captivating enough, further brought down by that annoying monotone drawl of Reeves' voice, and constantly needs support from the other characters in the film. Even the 20-second flashbacks of his childhood we see aren't enough to garner attention or pity for this soul branded for hell.

The worst of it is that we expect this hero to maintain and carry along what little plot there is, stretched out over 2 hours. Honestly, folks, there is not much going on here. The filmmakers probably made about 5 storyboards and decided to make each one 20 minutes long. Inbetween the grueling beginning and the much-anticipated end, there's a whole lot of nothing eye-candy that manages to transfix into a bit of something, but not enough. Somehow we get from the death of a psychiatric patient to the end of the world...? And even when the movie's over, there's STILL unanswered questions. I don't mean, ""Oh, will Angela and John get together?"" nonsense but ""Uh what happened to the dead sister??"" No doubt saving for an equally painful sequel.

So don't waste your money on this over-budgeted Keanu-promoting campaign...oh, oh I mean, thriller! ""The Seventh Seal,"" ""12 Monkeys,"" good flicks. Not this. No.",1122940800,9,2836,4.746450304259635

7761516,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Dreary action thriller that would like you to believe that its about something when it's really about nothing. Keanu Reeves gives another one of his great wooden performance as a supernatural detective who helps a cop (Rachel Weisz) try to solve apparent suicide of her twin sister unknowing of the dark forces that are at work. Safe to say that Keanu is ready to save the world again but when he does it, you don't believe a single thing he does because you don't believe him in the role. The movie would have been better served if they got an actor who would have played the role a bit more maturely and with a bit more feeling but Reeves just seem more like a cry baby than a man who know what he is doing and he just does not come across well in the role. The script unfortunately adds fuel to the fire with its unfocused story and lousy lines of dialog, which is literally over juvenile for a movie that has such dark themes.  The direction also adds nothing in terms of helping the movie out of its dilemma with way too many unfocused shots and too many unnecessary scenes that adds nothing to the movie at all.

There is some good in this movie and it comes from Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie's only stellar performance. She's so good that you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen while you know deep down that the movie is not as good as her performance.  Another good performance comes from Peter Stormare who is criminally underused in a bit part as the devil himself. His performance is ten times more potent than the lousy performance of Keanu Reeves as the lead and he's only in the film for about five minutes.

I don't know exactly what went wrong with this film but if the producers of the movie wanted to make a better film, they just could have cut Keanu out all together and just focus on the great performance of Weisz and Stormare. Add a director who knows what he is doing and a script that makes sense and you have a great movie there. This movie unfortunately is not very good and you can thank Keanu and the director for that.",1122854400,8,2082,4.3307692307692305
7761517,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"When I saw that ""Constantine"" was coming to the big screen I wasn't all that excited at first.  Mainly because I had never read the comic book 'Hellblazer', that inspired the film.  Then I saw the preview and it looked like a very entertaining sci-fi/religious thrill ride in the vein of 'The Prophecy' series, ""End of Days"", and ""Hellboy"", plus Keanu looked pretty cool in one of his first post-'Matrix' action films.

""Constantine"" is based on the popular Vertigo/DC Comic 'Hellblazer', which follows the demon hunting exploits of its hero John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).  Constantine is a chain smoking, wise-cracking, selfish demon hunter, whose primary goal in life is to send as many of Hell's minions back to where they belong and hopefully work his way into Heaven.  During his quest he is aided by Chaz (Shia Lebouf), Papa Midnight (Djimon Hounsou), and a seemingly duplictious angel named Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).  When a cop (Rachel Weisz) discovers her twin sister has seemingly committed suicide, she enlists the aide of Constantine in discovering what exactly happened to her God-fearing sister to cause her to end her life.  This mystery only deepens as Constantine discovers that demons are attempting to crossover into Earth's realm, and this cop, when coupled with the mythic Spear of Destiny, is the key.

With terrific special effects, most notably the imaginative interpretation of Hell as being an alternate reality, so that it appears to be a constantly buring Los Angeles.  Pitch-perfect performances by the cast, that bring depth and reality to their comic book counterparts, and fast-paced editing and directing from first time movie director Francis Lawrence, ""Constantine"" is sci-fi/religious thriller that is guaranteed to keep you entertained.

Though, not entirely faithful to the comic book according to fan boys and the movies own making of featurette admits this, the film is an enjoyable comic book adaptation.  The theology for the movie is steeped primarily in Catholicism, even then it's not an accurate depiction of the faith, definitely not a movie to base your religious beliefs on, but then again it never aspired for that purpose.  As I said earlier, it appeared this one would be another one of the great sci-fi/religious thrillers, and I was right.  If you enjoyed 'The Prophecy' series, ""Hellboy"", 'The Omen' franchise, or ""End of Days"", then this movie is for you.

With the great success of ""Constantine"" hopefully Warner Brothers will realize the potential in this film for a franchise, especially since Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, and Djimon Hounsou have all expressed interest in returning, and treat audiences to more demon hunting with ""Constantine 2"".

The movie didn't reel you in like some thrillers, it was like being on the outside watching people do things that didn't seem to make much impact on their environment. The special effects were 'good', but nothing new.

I guess some graphic novels don't translate well to film or the wrong person was doing the screenplay. I had hoped this movie to be intriguing, thought provoking, with action added to improve the flow, but got none of that...a disappointment at best.",1122768000,,678,4.844827586206897

However, if you're looking for classic good versus evil, and a good time with a few humorous moments thrown in, then I would definitely recommend this.

The script itself is so poorly written that you will be astounded by some of the dialog that is spoken by the characters in this film and the plot really does not make a lot of sense once you try to put two and two together. Rachel Weisz does in fact give a riveting and haunting performance but she's the only actor in the film who dares to give one while the rest of the actors in the film fall flat on their faces with their one dimensional characters. (Peter Stormare does do well in his small but pivotal role but he's only in the movie for about three to four minutes) The visual effects are a let down compared to the films that have come out recently in the cinema and they get repetitive after a while. The direction is a joke with certain scenes that are shot so poorly that you have no idea on what is going on from scene to scene. A better director would have tried to make some sense on what was happening but this director only adds to the confusion that is already in the script. If you like to make fun of bad movies, then this movie is for you because other than Weisz's gutsy and complex performance, the movie has nothing to offer in the form of real entertainment.",1122768000,6,1336,4.22265625

I think Keanu is actually a dark character or at least plays it well in this film. I don't know why there is so much hostility towards this man but I am writing this review to defend him and his acting. I actually think he acted pretty well in this movie, especially in the beginning of the movie where he takes the demon out of a poor girl. Keanu Reeves has good acting skills and actually played out this movie well. This movie's plot is what drew me to this film because it sounded interesting, even though I am not too religious and this movie is heavily drenched in religion. Yet it was played out good nonetheless. I was drawn to see what would happen at the end and it was not predictable. I like the alternative ending as well on the deleted scenes but definitely the first ending is better.

Don't take what a lot of these reviewers said so personally, fellow reader. Keanu Reeves is not as bad as they make him sound. He is actually pretty good in this movie and made this film quite interesting. Honestly if there was a young exorcist I would imagine him to look a lot like Keanu, dark hair and all. The other actors aren't too bad either, I thought the person who played Gabriel was very interesting. I give this movie a solid four stars. Like the movie Stigmata was for me, it was good as a thriller, but too heavily religious for me to be five star. Still good though, and worth watching.",1122768000,5,1508,4.309859154929577

Rachel Weisz is actually surprisingly good in this movie and would have been better if she didn't have such a terrible co-worker but i guess there's nothing anyone can do about that so we'll move on to the plot.  Good, overall.  Some things were fairly lacking though, and also some were completely unnecessary (stuff that happens in the end i don't want to give away in this review).

""Constantine"" tries to do both, which undermines a strong wealth of production values and direction.  The actors: Rachel Weisz, Djimon Honsou and Peter Stomare all have found the right tone for their parts.  Unfortunately Keanu Reeves is miscast as an adult.  He should only do parts that require him to be juvenile, which is why the ""Matrix"" movies were perfect for him.

I was put off at the beginning because Constantine has a smoking habit...well any smoker worth their weight in nicotine will tell you that the way Keanu smokes a cigarette is on par with a 12 year old girl trying it for the first time at a slumber party.

So how can you build a premise on lung cancer if you don't even take it into your lungs?

Also,when is Hollywood going to realize that you can throw CGI on the public but that does not mean that it will be worth anything.  Constantines descent to Hell should be terrifying but it is just another day to him.

Studios really should go back to the days of screen testing.  They should ignore actor ego and test to see if they fit the part.  I am so tired of seeing movies that have a lot going for them except an essential element.",1122595200,3,1238,4.409691629955947

I accept that as a reality that will not change. But, this movie is very watchable on its own. Yes, it has a few moments of Hollywood cheese, like the the cross shotgun (makes me shudder and ask WHY? WHY? ); but overall it's pretty good. Over years of hyper-critical movie analysis, I've learned to accept that Hollywood will never change, and they will twist and distort anything of true artistic merit in order to make it more profitable (or so they think). When it comes to big budget movies, take my advice, expect nothing and you'll be more likely to find something you enjoy about it.

The other problem is Keanu Reeves, who is just the wrong guy to play a role like this. He comes across more like he's constipated than a brooding P.I. who dabbles with the occult. The movie falls on his shoulders and it falls off the map of credibility because of it. Other than Keanu's attempt at drama, the acting is decent for what it is and that because of the efforts of a few actors who are trying to keep a strait face while speaking the bad dialog from the script. First and foremost is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which give this film more class and substance than the script dares to give it. To say that her performance is much better than the film itself is an understatement because it's much more than the film even inspires to be. She's so good in fact that you actually do feel sorry for her for even being in it in the first place. The second great performance belongs to Djmon Hounsou, who does wonders with his role, even though it more of an bit role than a central one.

Tilda Swinton also does well with her part but unfortunately for her, her role literally give this movie the biggest plot hole of all. A plot hole big enough for it to kill the last act of the film.

Here Reeves plays an unfortunate exorcist wandering the streets of New York banishing misbehaving half breed demons back to hell. Constantine is yet another movie derived from a comic book series I haven't read, but frankly, I don't get the feeling I missed that much.

The writer and director have managed to almost completely recreates the Matrix plot in this new context (substitue demons for Rogue programmes and the real world / hell divide for the real world / matrix divide), which you might have thought would make it an easier adjustment for Reeves but he still fails to act, turning in yet another stirling performance as himself, which worked sort of OK-ish in the Matrix, but by now has become a little tired.

Rachel Weisz plays Keanu's love interest, who is roped into Reeves' anti-demon war when her twin sister (who has been committed to a mental institution because she sees demons) kills herself and (as a good catholic) is cast into hell.

Whilst some have raved about Rachel Weisz's performance here I can't help feeling its more because she's gorgeous than as a result of her acting talent. Even if her acting was of oscar winning quality, there's not much she can do about the script (her character's actions are utterly unbelieveable even within the scope of the ridiculous plot).

He helps a girl find out the truth behind her sister's supposed sucide, which everyone but her believes that she comitted.

The special effects in the movie, which are included in scenes where Constatine confronts these half-bloods are very good. The camera work in the movie is done very well.

Comic fans were pissed that they didn't cast a blond haired British guy in the title role, and many considered Keanu a bastardization of the source material.  Well, tough.  That's why it's called ""Constantine"" and not ""Hellblazer.""  It's not meant to be a direct translation of a comic book.

Constantine has a ""gift"" to see demons walking among men.  Because of something he did early in his life, he's forever damned to go to hell.  He's concocted a plan to send demons back to hell in order to gain the good graces of heaven, but after years of trying to redeem his soul, he has tacitly acknowledged it's a lost cause.  Keanu does a good job of portraying a guy who knows he's going to hell and is now just going through the motions.  Constantine is a sorry individual - and Keanu's deadpan and morose delivery is spot on.  The movie has some of the best scenes of hell that I've ever seen and the story really works.  I was actually so into this movie that I DID go out and buy the comic books - first ones I'd bought since I was a kid.  The shot framing, lighting, and dialogue are all very film noir, which makes for something different than most other movies coming out lately.  I dug it.

Keanu Reeves did not cut it in the main role and the script was so badly written that you actually thought of better dialog in your head while you are watching it. I agree with a lot of what has been said about Rachel Weisz and her great performance but not even her great effort could have saved it from it's own bad script and it's really bad leading man.

My one star review goes to Rachel Weisz and the slick DVD extras but the movie gets an no stars from me .",1122422400,2,598,4.146551724137931

Keanu is miscast to the point of hurting the film and his performance as John Constantine should be considered a criminal act. I agree with everyone who have seen this film that Rachel Weisz does do wonders for this horrible film with her amazing performance but she is by herself in the good acting department and does not get a real actor to play with int'l the end where Peter Stormare shows up as the king of darkness himself but with only four minutes of screen time, he does not make an enough presence to give Weisz the support she needs to save this film.

See the film in order to witness a great actress who's trying desperately to save this film but other than her grant effort to give the audience something to watch, she's let down (as well as the viewer) by a badly written script and a leading man who can't act.",1122422400,3,934,4.461988304093567
7761538,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine marks the feature film debut of music video director Francis Lawrence who, judging by the look of this movie, would like to follow in the footsteps of David Fincher. For his first time out, Lawrence takes on the daunting task of adapting the excellent comic book, Hellblazer. Its main character, John Constantine first appeared in the pages of Swamp Thing, during an illustrious run by Alan Moore. Eventually, Constantine got his own series with the launch of DC Comics' Vertigo line. Jamie Delano was the primary writer and fleshed out the character's backstory, his friends (like Chas the cabbie) and family. These stories typified late `80s comic book horror and provided a bridge between Moore and the next creative heavyweight to tackle the character, Garth Ennis. His run on Hellblazer is where the movie gets most of its material from. Constantine is a chain-smoking, hard-drinking guy suffering from terminal lung cancer. He becomes embroiled in a complex war between Heaven and Hell with humanity caught in the middle.

Fans of the comic book are probably not going to like this movie. Constantine is supposed to be world-weary, a sarcastic drunk and womanizer but Reeves doesn't quite pull it off. He presents a more sanitized version of the comic book character and even that feels forced. Another major betrayal of the character is having him wield a gun (a cool-looking crucifix shotgun), something that the Constantine of the comic would never do. Reeves is unable sell the character convincingly and is miscast in this role. Guy Pearce or Clive Owen would have been a much better choice to play Constantine.

Despite the miscasting of Reeves and Weisz in the two main roles, Lawrence's take on Constantine is actually quite entertaining, even more so if you haven't read the comic book. However, fans of the series will have problems with the major liberties the filmmakers have taken with the characters - especially Constantine and Chas. Like most comic book adaptations, this film only sprinkles certain elements from the source material, just enough to vaguely resemble it while watering it down for mainstream consumption. It's a shame because in the right hands, Constantine could have been this year's Hellboy instead it's closer to the flawed, missed opportunity of The Punisher.

On the first DVD there is an audio commentary by Francis Lawrence, producer Akiva Goldsman and screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello. Lawrence does his best to keep on topic and actually comment on what we are watching while Goldsman does his best to come off as very annoying and unfunny.

Also included is a music video for the song ""Passive"" by A Perfect Circle. It's pretty standard stuff with the band playing through distorted visuals with lots of clips from the movie.

There is also the teaser and theatrical trailer.

The catch phrase of the extras on second DVD is how everyone wanted to ""stay true to the spirit ""of the comic book. Everyone involved makes a point of defending the changes made from comic to film. ""Conjuring Constantine"" traces the character's origins from The Swamp Thing to Hellblazer. Not surprisingly, Alan Moore and Garth Ennis are not interviewed as I'm sure they'd have a few things to say about the liberal changes made.

""The Production from Hell"" features Lawrence talking about the pressures of making his first feature film.

""Imagining the Underworld"" takes a look at the film's version of Hell. Lawrence wanted it to resemble Los Angeles' highway after a nuclear bomb test explosion. Several other special effects set pieces are examined and shown how they were put together.

""Constantine Cosmology"" examines the role mythology plays in the movie and how it compares to the heroic journey according to the writings of Joseph Campbell.

""Foresight: The Power of Pre-Visualization"" shows how certain scenes were mapped out in terms of point-of-view, angles, and camera moves via computer animation with an optional audio commentary by Lawrence.

Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lawrence. He talks about why they were cut, usually for reasons of pacing. A character from the comic book, Ellie the demon, was cut from the film and her scene is included.

A nice touch with this deluxe edition is the inclusion of a mini-comic book that includes stories by Delano and Ennis.",1122422400,2,4372,5.073816155988858

Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie.",1122422400,3,926,4.485207100591716
7761540,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I'm a longtime fan of the Hellblazer comic, and I understand the agitation of purists who consider this to be a desecration of a great storyline. That being said, I didn't hate this movie.

If the studio had used the foresight to properly cast this movie (Rachel Weisz was good casting, Keanu...well, suffice to say he's NOT John Constantine) and place it in London where it belongs, then this film could have been a keeper.

This movie is a slippery slope. If you're familiar with the story, and cant see past the 'interpretation', then you'll hate it. If you're unfamiliar with the story, you won't get it and you'll probably hate it. However, if you're open to seeing Constantine as a dark haired, black coated, exorcist for hire in Los Angeles as opposed to the blonde, khaki trench coat-wearing, brittish occultist that he really is, you'll probably enjoy it.

Bottom line is that they screwed this movie up by trying to Americanize it, but if you're a fan it's worth watching.",1122422400,5,982,4.730994152046784

At least THAT would have been original. Well, I was wrong...right after the bed thing, anyway.  Yes, I know, many ppl don't seem to care for Keanu Reeves, but I must say, this is one of his best work.  With it's special effects, and engaging story plot, it wasn't hard for me to really emmerse myself in this movie.  Gaven (singer from Bush) took me out of the story JUST for a second, ONLY because I didn't know he was going to be in this movie, and was thinking, ""Gwen must be proud.""  Anyway, it wasn't long before I was sucked back into the movie again.  Being a non religious person, I have to admit, it really did make me wonder about existence.

7761542,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Now I hate to be one of those people that whines about how the movie was not as good as the book, or in this case, the comic book, but I'm going to have to.  It's especially frustrating as we just saw Frank Miller's Sin City come out not long after and stay very faithful, even down to the gritty two-color look.  I don't have a problem with Keanu Reeves but he simply was not the right guy to play a chain-smoking, run-down, sardonic Englishman that Constantine is supposed to be.  I think someone like Gary Oldman would have been a great choice to play Constantine.

Keanu does the chain smoking but he looks like a guy who just started smoking yesterday, rather than the wizened, look of someone who actually HAD been chain smoking for years...add to that he does about the WORST fake coughing I've ever heard in my life.  The average ten year-old kid can fake a cough better to get out of school than Keanu does in this film.

I don't mind the CGI and I think the director Francis lawrence did a pretty good job of NOT getting carried away with too many visual effects.  But how does a guy who never directed a feature film before get the reins to a film with this large a budget anyway?  While he resisted going overboard with the CGI he couldn't resist in turning what was a pure, very dark horror comic into a Van Helsing meets the Devil action flick.  There's more action in the average episode of ""This Old House"" than there is in an issue of Hellblazer.  Hellblazer is NOT an action hero...he's not a hero period.  Not even a good guy really and ultimately that's what Lawrence had him become...a pretty boy demon hunter.

I won't delve too much into the script although I'd love to know why the Spear of Destiny was buried in the Mexican desert.  The film does have a pretty good supporting cast with Rachel Weisz as the cop/psychic object of the devil's search, and Peter Stromare as the devil himself in yet another oddball role he seems born to play.

With all that said I'm still going to give it a slightly positive review.  I thought the story was pretty well-written although I think the plot was perhaps a bit too grand.  The affects were good, particularly those scenes in the wind-blasted desolation of hell.  Overall its hit or miss but there's more good than bad.",1122336000,2,2286,4.430622009569378
7761543,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I think most people that saw this movie had certain expectations.  If you were a hardcore fan of Hellblazer, the comic series the film was based upon, you were likely unable to get over the relocation to Los Angeles, an American John Constantine, and well, Keanu.  If you thought this was a horror flick, you weren't happy either.  Why anyone would think this was a horror film, I don't know, but apparently that was not an uncommon belief.

As an thinking-man's action film, Constantine hits pretty close to the mark.  It's got good action.  It demands some thought from the audience.  If you let it, you will be asking questions of yourself and your faith (perhaps that's why some people disliked it so much?). And as much as I hate to say it, even Keanu does a pretty good turn here.  He's no Lawrence Olivier (sp?), but he doesn't distract from the action.

This isn't The Matrix in Hell.  The character is different.  The plot is different.  Can we let that rest?

All in all, a pretty good movie.  It may not achieve greatness (like Bladerunner for example), but it's far from Battlefield Earth.",1122336000,8,1101,4.608247422680412

I would love to meet the casting agent with though that Keanu Reeves of all people would have been great in this movie. The dialog is so bad in this film that you really are taken a back at the sheer stupidity of it and the story does not hold any weight as for as common sense goes. Keanu's interpretation of the character goes into overload after the first half-hour and the rest of the movie follows his lead into absurdity. The special effects are poorly done for a movie of this size and the cinematography is just horrible in some parts of the film. Of the supporting cast, only Rachel Weisz(Confidence, Runaway Jury) and Peter Stormare(Birth,Fargo) come out of this movie with passing grades and that's because they are both able to transcend the horrible script with very good performances that is better than the whole entire film. Weisz gives a strong and compelling performance with her character and that in itself a huge compliment considering the fact that the script does not do her performance any justice and Peter Stormare dominates the last ten minutes of the film with a perfect performance that should have been a lead instead of a cameo.

Other than their performances, the movie just does not cut it and that's because of the lame writing and the miscasting of Keanu Reeves.",1122249600,5,1491,4.690839694656488

7761549,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I've been reading _Hellblazer_ since the beginning.  In fact, I've been a fan of John Constantine since Alan Moore created him in _Swamp Thing._  So I viewed the prospect of a Hellblazer movie with trepidation.  The more I heard about it, the more disgusted I got with the Hollywoodization of one of my favourite characters.  I didn't see the movie in the theatre, but I rented the DVD on the first day it came out--because I knew I'd do it sometime and wanted to get it over with.  And you know, this movie isn't nearly as bad as it could have been.

John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see beyond this mortal coil (something that's never really explained in the book, so here they make something up).  He lives his life as a kind of roving, last-chance exorcist, getting rid of otherworldly nasties that have broken the rules that allow them to manifest on this plane.  He has his allies--a priest who hears voices and a nerdy supply agent (kind of a metaphysical ""Q""), but mostly he's a loner.  Unfortunately for him, he's diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in the beginning of the movie (this idea is losely based on Garth Ennis' ""Dangerous Habits"" storyline).  But something big is coming and he hopes that getting involved in whatever it is will end up in his spending eternity in Heaven, rather than the other place (to which it seems sure he's bound).

Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a police detective with a psychic punch of her own. Her sister has recently met her end in an apparent suicide.  Because they're devout Catholics, to whom suicide is a mortal sin, Angela is invested in believing Isabel didn't actually take her own life.  Trying to prove it leads her to Constantine.  As an unlikely team, they try to figure out what's making the boundaries between Earth and Hell so thin and to stop it before it's too late.

_Hellblazer_ fans watching this movie should do what I did:  repeat to yourself, ""It's not MY John Constantine;  it's another bloke with the same name.""  This should help you get past the obvious problems with the character (like he's a dark-haired American instead of a blond Englishman--at least they axed the ""Constantine-mobile"") and allow you to enjoy what's enjoyable about the flick.  And there is quite a bit to enjoy.  The plot is pretty good;  in fact, it makes a fair stab at being many-layered.  As in many metaphysical horror type flicks, a large suspension of disbelief is required.  You just gotta accept that such-and-such an artifact calls up demons because some guy says so.  _Constantine_ the movie didn't exactly make this easy.  There was a lot of over-the-top stuff going on that didn't adhere to any internal logic.  But  if the pill was hard to swallow, at least swallowing was possible.

The performances were also pretty good.  Keanu Reeves was pretty much Keanu Reeves (and as such, never my first choice for J.C.;  I would have liked to have seen James Marsters or whasisname from ""Trainspotting."")  But his standard character fit into the script well enough.  Rachel Weisz was also in a fairly standard lady-cop role.  It was the minor characters who really hooked me.  Tilda Swinton as Gabriel was an interesting casting choice, trying for the androgyny of angels (but not quite making it;  Swinton's voice was too high-pitched).  Lucifer, Papa Midnite and John's several sidemen also turned in good work.  The only one I didn't like was Chas, whose role had devolved into a wisecracking boy-hostage type.

What I didn't like about this movie was pretty much what I had expected:  _Hellblazer_, though chock full of various dismemberments and disfigurements, is essentially a book of psychological horror.  John Constantine is not an action hero.  Therefore, Hollywood's insistence on making him one--complete with a dragon breath flamethrower for demon fighting (please!)--did not sit well with me.  So the movie had a jerky feel as it battled between having a coherent and interesting plot and simply blowing up zombies.

_Constantine's_ main fault is that it tries to do too many things at once.  There's too much melodrama and silly widgets for people looking for a thinking thriller.  For those to whom blowing up zombies is reason enough, there's too much plot getting in the way.  As a movie, it tries to straddle a line between genres and ends up shaking a lot.  Still, there were satisying moments I would consider renting it worth the money.

Usually when I watch a movie at home I am always doing something or paying attention to something else but this movie really held my rapt attention.  Since I don't read comics my judgement wasn't colored by that.  The performances were good and there was even comedy.

7761552,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Dreadfully flawed and with a muddled story line, ""Constantine"" is nevertheless worth watching, for its occasional profound and intense beauty, and its visions of hell and its denizens, which anyone who believes that forces of evil exist and influence our world will find fascinating. Loosely based on characters from the Hellblazer comics, the script is very interesting in parts, but the audio is abysmal. The dialog sounds as if it is coming from an underwater tunnel, and I had to watch the film with subtitles. Also, this is a film that begs to be seen several times, to make some sense of the muddle.

The cast is excellent, and I have always been partial to Keanu Reeves, who as John Constantine, a man dying of lung cancer, who can see, and has walked beyond this dimension, is very good in his own peculiar way. I can't imagine anyone else of his generation playing the part. As he says of the cat in the film, he's ""half in, half out,"" and Reeves also has that quality, of being in the world, but not quite of it. Rachel Weisz, who teamed with Reeves in the far less interesting 1996 ""Chain Reaction,"" is both Angela, a Los Angeles detective, and her twin sister Isabel. She looks gorgeous, and gives a sensitive, lovely performance. Others in the cast that stand out are Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, and Shia LaBeouf, as Chas, Constantine's eager apprentice.

This is the feature directorial debut of Francis Lawrence, who has previously done music videos, and he certainly has an eye for bizarre imagery. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is terrific, and much of what is worthwhile in this film is due to him. It is hard to rate this film, as it is, like the battle of good and evil in the story, a mixture of opposites. Total running time is 121 minutes, it is rated R for ""violence and demonic images,"" but is comparatively mild in language and has no in-between the sheets action. The DVD extra is 18 minutes of deleted scenes.",1122163200,91,1946,4.63768115942029
7761553,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"That is the way to describe Constantine starring Keanu Reeves.  the basic premis for the movie is that John Constantine has been kicked out of Heaven because he was a suicide and he was revived after two minutes of being dead.  Since his revival, Constantine has been fighting demons and sending them back to Hell and he is fearfull of being sent back to hell with all of the angry demons he has sent back.  In walks Rachael Weisz playing both parts of twins trying to figure out why one of the twins committed suicide.  Of course the rest of the movie is demons trying to kill Constatine to keep him from finding out the truth.

The movie is short on story and long on special effects.  the special effects are cool to watch and the film does well on this alone, but the special effects can't carry this epic and starts to fail miserably after a short while.  Constantine is silly and eye candy only, but it is a nice way to pass some time.  Nothing special here unless you are a Reeves fan and then you will like for that alone.

7761554,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"A lot of people say Keanu Reeves can't act...a statement which, to me, isn't exactly true...I think he can act, but just that his abilities and range are limited to the point where most of his characters come off as being something someone carved out of wood (deadwood at that)...at the very least, he's still got his good looks to fall back on, and in world dominated by superficialities, that can take you far...disagree?  Then why are so many people interested in a vacuous, untalented void, with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, named Paris Hilton?  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh on Ms. Hilton, but I do so tire of constantly seeing her visage plastered over every stinking media outlet as if she's someone truly worthy of the attention...based on a DC/Vertigo comic book (or graphic novel, if you prefer) called Hellblazer, Constantine (2005) was adapted for the screen by Kevin Brodbin (The Glimmer Man) and directed by Francis Lawrence, whose previous credits are limited to a TV series called `Making the Video', a show that focuses on the actual making of music videos, which, to me, is about one step below those who actually direct music videos, but hey, we all have to start some place...starring in the movie is Keanu `Mr. Woodenhead' Reeves (The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), along with the very attractive and talented Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Beautiful Creatures).  Also appearing is Tilda Swinton (Vanilla Sky), whom often gets confused with actress Cate Blanchett, former lead singer from the band Bush Gavin Rossdale, crazy eyeball man Pruitt Taylor Vince (Monster), Max Baker (The Island), Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator), Shia LaBeouf (I, Robot), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) as the embodiment of all that is evil, that's right, I'm talking about Satan...can you dig it?

Keanu plays John Constantine, a chain smoking demon hunter, stuck between Heaven and Hell.  Apparently God and the Devil are engaged in a wager, with the souls of all mankind at stake, and since angels and demons can't cross onto our plane of reality, both sides use what's called half breeds to peddle influence, hoping to draw individuals one way or another.  When these half-breeds, specifically the ones from Hell (as you can figure, they're notorious cheaters), break the rules, Constantine deports them back to whence they came, sort of an immigration officer of the damned.  Recently Constantine has been noticing demonic activity above and beyond what he's used to, and it appears to be tied to the suicide death of the sister of a L.A. detective Angela Dodson, played by Weisz, who believes her devoutly Catholic sister who have never risked eternal damnation by doing so, and thereby must have been murdered.  Their paths eventually cross, and Constantine's contacts begin turning up dead (as they get too close to the answer), with signs indicating a possible shift in the fragile balance between good and evil is coming, one that could mean an end to the good times here on Earth.

I think this movie is a great example of what happens when one focuses so much on all the little details, and not enough on the casting, expecting any old high profile name to fit the bill and tie it all together...namely in Reeves.  Now I've had the opportunity to read the original story way back when it came out in the Hellblazer comic book, and while I can't recall many of the details, I certainly had a good idea with regards to the character of Constantine, and Reeves just didn't fit the bill, no matter how much they tried to jam his square peg into the round hole.  His character displayed the cynical attitudes and sarcastic, sometimes caustic nature, but it didn't feel like it actually emanated from within Reeves but rather something he was trying to channel from the script.  At least Weisz was there to pick up some of the slack, but there was just too much for her to handle...and so little attention was given to the supporting characters so they were unable to help in that aspect.  Also, I thought the script was somewhat weak, as the dialog added very little life to the characters, with perhaps the exception of Weisz and Stormare, who were both relatively interesting to watch...also, the script and direction seemed to expect a lot of difficult intuitive assumptions from the audience, which often resulted in some confusing aspects that didn't necessarily get cleared up by the end of the story (the Spear of Destiny aspect, in particular).  In terms of the direction, I thought there were some great individual sequences, but when tied together, they didn't work as well as they could have.  The real strength of the film lies in the production design, bringing the special effects to life and merging them in with the real life elements.  They certainly provided a visually interesting and entertaining backdrop to the story, it's just too bad Reeves was chosen to be the focal point of the story as he just couldn't pull it off, or at least that's my opinion, which in the grand scheme of things counts for very little.  I've watch much of the extras in the `making of' featurettes, so I have some idea of the amount of work that went into developing the look and feel of the film, so I wanted to give those folks credit as they worked extremely hard and held up their end very well.  Would a different lead actor have made the difference?  It certainly would have helped a lot, as Keanu's performance only helped to exacerbate the relative weaknesses, specifically in the script, and to a lesser degree, in the direction.  Overall the film was fun and somewhat interesting, but hardly one anyone should rush out to see, especially die-hard fans of the source material, as they'll probably be disappointed the most given such a lack luster, high profile showing of such an interesting and complicated character...is it me, or, for those who read the storyline featured in this film, so much more surprising in the comic than in the film?  I suppose since I knew how it was going to end, the shock value was limited, but it just felt like it came off so much more effective in the comic...

I won't bother going over the boat load of extras, as the Amazon website lists them in detail adequately enough, but they did help me appreciate the film a bit more than I did after I saw it...

The huge problem that this film has is of course Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the point of the film becoming a joke and the screenplay is way too incoherent to understand most of the things that are happening in the film. The lackluster dialog seem more like a USA cable film that a real movie that was releases in the theaters and the special effects don't hold any ground what so ever and they get repetitive after a while, losing most of it's attended impact along the way.

Another actor who does way more than he should have is Djimon Hounsou and he does not have enough screen time to make a better impact as well as Peter Stormare, who great interpretation of the King of Darkness is just in the movie for about four minutes.

I was totally unaware of the graphic novel upon which this Keanu (my middle name is ""zzzzz"") Reeves' suicidal vehicle was purportedly based.

John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an exorcist.  His death from lung cancer is getting closer and closer to his soul and John's guaranteed a ""Go to Hell and Do not Pass Go"" card when he dies because he attempted suicide when he was very young--and actually died for a short time.

Angela (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who can pick a serial killer out of a crowd and shoot them.  She sees things, though she denies it. When her twin sister died of suicide in a mental hospital, She believes some other evil forces were at play because her sister would never have done something like that.

Angela learns about Constantine from a priest and goes seeking him for help.  Though a cop, she doesn't know about the daily struggle Constantine goes through to keep the balance between Good-and-Evil and the infestation of half-demons in the world.

Demon activity is increasing in LA and it's harder to kick those bad boys back to Hell.  Turns out, a homeless man named Francisco has discovered the Spear of Destiny in a remote Mexican church and is under the Devil's instructions to bring the spear to LA.  If Francisco makes it, Hell's going to win the balance.  As he gets closer to LA, things get even more dangerous.  Constantine and Angela have to team up to fight the forces of evil.

His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happing.  Makes no sense but that's some of the inconstancies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now.

The story sounds simple enough but it get convoluted in all the supernatural happening that is going on and the screenplay really does not bother to explain itself in those occurrences.  The special effects are good but some of them are repetitive and some visuals are not that well done. The acting is decent for a movie of this kind with Rachel Weisz proving once again to be one of the most versatile and talented actresses of her generation. Her performance is actually too good for this film because it demands a better showcase than this film. Her character is strong enough to hold this film by herself but with the inconsistent writing that is in the screenplay, she is reduced to carrying Keanu on her shoulders while he is trying to figure out on which film he's in.  Which leads to the film's biggest problem and that is Keanu Reeves himself. He's miscast in the role of John Constantine and a better actor would have been able to show more of his sides than Keanu was able to do. Keanu just comes a cross as a jerk and that would have been alright if he at least showed some humanity but Keanu can't balance that out and he just comes across really bad. A better actor would have done more but with Keanu, you really can't expect much and you don't get anything here.

Director Frances Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it.

Djmon Hounsou, who was so great in the film "" In America"" only has a bit part here and he does well with it but I would have rather had him play a much bigger role than he was allowed to play in this film. Peter Stormare, who was so great in the movies ""Birth"" and ""Chocolat"", gives quite an unusual take of the devil. Unfortunately, he's not in the movie very much at all. The special effects are good but the way hell is represented here is more a variation of the sets that was used in the film than something completely original.

It seems that the script was supposed to sound smart and supposed to make the audience understand everything that was going on but me and the others who watched this movie grasped nothing. When your pondering about whats going on storywise your hit with special effects or a battle scene or some explosion to detract from the convuluted story.

The Plot-Constantine(Keanu reeves) is a tortured soul who after coming back to life from a suicide attempt when younger who now as an adult slays half-breed angels or demons who try to possess or influence people more than they should, and if they pass this barrier that is made He has to right to kill them.
And in this movie Constantine develops lung cancer and feels he should go to heaven after all the demon killings he's done but is still marked for hell.
(not confusing right? sure)
But wait theres more
There is an ancient sword  that has something to do with satans son being released onto earth which has to something to do with the angel gabriel when has something to do with these two twins which one commits suicide.(I know i lost you, i'm lost too.)

The Action-Now this is where the movie picks up some stars. I have to say this movie does have some very good special effects which we are shown Hell, demons, heaven and very cool demon death scenes.
The Battles scenes between Constantine and demons are very good and C's Arsenal is very deadly from Crucifix shaped shotguns to holy water grenade's to flamethrowers and gold plated knuckles with crucifixes engraved, cool huh?

The Negatives-Well if you haven't noticed---THE STORY!!!!!!
this is one story that is HARD AS HELL-pun intended- to capture and follow and all that you understand is Constantine is just one big shallow complainer. From his rants of ""I don't want to go to hell, i'm a freakin demon-slayer for christ's sake"" to ""my life sucks, i'm better off dead"" Constantine is just one big crybaby and makes for one of the worst hero's ever caught on cinema.
During the last scenes of the movie i wanted Constantine to die already and just be put out of his misery already because he was making me feel miserable.

In Conclusion-Good special effects, nice action scenes don't make a movie great. Maybe if this movie was released in the 80's this could have passed off as good but it's not.
Confusing story, miserable lead character, weak supporting cast(even though Shia labeouf was a little amusing)and weak ending make Constantine a Weekend Rental but not a buy.

Dvd bonuses include 18 minutes of additional scenes and a alternative ending(Woop-de-frickin-doo)

7761575,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine certainly makes up for most of the senseless trash that's put out in the theaters today. The script was well-made. Alot of time was clearly put into the plot.

Excellent performances were put-forth for Constantine. I really enjoyed Peter Stormare's performance in his role of Satan and Tilda Swinton's in her role of the archangel Gabriel. Although, I did find it kind of odd that a woman was cast as Gabriel... But, she handled the role so well that in the end, casting a female rather than a male in that role did seem more fitting. It really worked. But, my favorite portrayal of Gabriel is still Christopher Walken's in the Prophecy series (I recommend that series for supernatural thrillers, too!).

Reeves and Weisz both put-forth great performances. I don't know why people are trying to compare Reeves's performance in this movie to that of his much earlier role in The Devil's Advocate. The way he's acting in this movie might be along the same track as Advocate's, but if so, why care? The way he portrays John Constantine is what the movie called for: a dark mind. And Contantine and Advocate are two completely different films with two completely different scenarios. The only similarity: they both deal with heaven and hell. Period. Deal with it. And don't even think of bringing up The Matrix. It's a masterpiece of filmmaking on its own wavelength. Similar concept: both Neo and Constantine are trying to save humanity. You get that alot in movies today.

The special-effects were mind-blowing. Whatever team of graphic designers worked on these demons really knew what they were doing. Nothing cheesy.

There is nothing wrong with Constantine. It's great. And I recommend listening to the commentary while watching it. Just give Constantine a try. Nothing bad here. Just 2 hours of superb acting with loads of mind AND eye candy!

7761577,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Based on the long running Hellblazer comic series from DC/Vertigo, Constantine is an underrated big budget smash.  Keanu Reeves, of all people, is cast as John Constantine: a man caught between Heaven and Hell.  Coming to the assistance of a detective (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister committed suicide, Constantine faces off against half-breed demons and angels, embroiled in a plot to bring Hell to Earth.  Pseudo-catholic mythology aside, the film for the most part has an intriguing story, and the CGI effects are top notch.  Reeves is fine as an american accented John Constantine, while Weisz gives the best performance of the film.  Tilda Swinton is a nice touch as the asexual Gabriel, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale provides a few chuckles as a slimy demon, and Peter Stormare makes a great Lucifer.  As a whole, Constantine is a great mainstream thriller, even though it is a bit drawn out, and at times, a bit hokey.  With all the negative reviews that Constantine has garnered since it's initial release (from reviewers and comic fans alike), it's terribly underrated for what it really is.  Yes, John's not english or blonde (Sean Bean, who has been in everything from the first Lord of the Rings film to Troy, would have been an excellent choice had the film been more faithful to it's source material), but it's still better than many of the recent comic to film adaptations to be released as of late.  The 2-disc Deluxe Edition DVD features some nice extras, including a horde of deleted scenes, and featurettes on the origin of the character.",1121990400,2,1555,4.88212927756654
7761578,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Keanu Reeves will undoubtedly never win an Academy Award for acting. That is actually a shame, because I think he delivers some really great performances. He's not as annoyingly flashy as Tom Cruise, as oddly lovable as Tom Hanks, or as physically expressive as Brad Pitt, but Reeves plays his characters as extensions of himself (which, by the way, as an actor myself, is the only way any human being can actually play a role) and his own internalization of his emotions. Reeves' eyes tell the story, not his face. The way he might hold his head provides you insight that another actor might display on his face.

All that said, Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine is as unique as his character of Jack Traven (Speed) was. (While I love the first Matrix, I was sorely disappointed by the director's vision and delivery of the sequels). Reeves delivers a great performance in Constantine.

John Constantine has always been tortured by the gift of seeing the evil that lurks just outside of the vision of most all other humans. When it became too much for him as a teenager, he committed suicide. He was brought back 2 minutes later, empowered with the ability to return ""halfbreed"" demons to Hell when they overstepped their boundaries. Unfortunately, he was also damned to hell for having committed suicide. Constantine continues to protect humans from the half breed demons in an effort to save his own soul.

With really cool sets and a script that keeps you guessing (with the exception of the ending), Constantine delivers a moody and surreal landscape for this world and that of hell. The demons are unique but not particularly scary. The scary stuff is the Biblical references.

This is based on a comic from Vertigo (DC) Comics. It's a dark film and I can only suppose that the comic was equally so.

I think the script was very engaging and tight up until the end. The ending of the film seems to take the easy way out. Whereas we see Constantine perform a painful and drawn out

exorcism early on, the final exorcism - with ostensibly a far more powerful demon - takes place relatively quickly and easily.

I love Tilda Swinton (wonderful as usual) as the angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Lucifer (though his performance was not so much evil as it was weirdly silly). Rachel Weitz was really interesting as the female lead. She made me completely forget her forgettable performance in The Mummy.

I also particularly loved the ""move ins"" to Weitz's character that Reeves does on several occasions. Watch the film and you'll see what i'm talking about.

This is not your standard fare - but it is not a rip off of The Exorcist or any other film (though it may share some similarity with Prophecy). Far more engaging than the Order or any other film of that nature, Constantine is leaps and bounds above those other films. It is due to a decent director, but really good performances by Reeves, Weitz and Swinton and an awesome set designer and cinematographer.

May not be everyone's cup of tea - but if you give it a chance you'll like it.",1121990400,,3054,4.6809701492537314
7761579,5,B01GJQCZ7Y,"A fun romp if you aren't a religious fanatic in which case the liberties taken by the story will probably offend you. Constantine is a Magus who does good deeds for completely selfish reasons in order to clean his slate of sins to get into heaven. So, he primarliy acts as an exorcist to the demonic spirits that try to break the balance of power between god and satan.

Lucifer is played very well and will give you a laugh or two with his interaction with Constantine.

Fans of Mage, Ars Magica, or other roleplaying games will probably enjoy the cosmology and the cool visual effects of Constantine employing his magic against the denizens of Hell.",1121990400,6,651,4.603448275862069

Keanu Reeves is miscast as the lead character, giving an under whelming performance that makes some of the other lackluster acting from the other actors in the movie look professional. Shia LaBeouf once again annoys in a supporting role that almost torpedoes the film and Tilda Swinton overacts in ways that makes her performance almost as bad as Keanu's and she's able to do that with only two scenes in the movie. Her monologue is so bad in the last act that it had most of the people laughing in my movie theater. The only two actors in the entire movie who manages to give good performances in this film and stand out in this hug pile of crap is Rachel Weisz, who gives too much grace and talent to this film and to her role and Peter Stormare, whose eight minute cameo does more  for the movie as a whole than Keanu does with his entire role.

7761582,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"While I wouldn't use ""Constantine"" as a source for any studies on Catholicism(or Christianity as a whole), I will admit that it is a decent flick to watch when there's a little time to kill.  I'm not familiar with the comics that this film is supposed to be based on, so I'll look at it as a stand-alone entity.

The story plods along at a snails pace, but the special effects are pretty good, especially the visions of Hell.  The opening exorcism is one of the best parts of the film.  Although Keanu Reeves catches a lot of grief over his performance in this flick, I think that his acting skills were perfect for this particular story.  Rachel Weisz is also very good in this film.  She tackles a briefly dual role as psychic sisters.  Her character's supposedly Catholic beliefs come into question when she mentions that she doesn't believe in Satan.  That's almost like saying you're a Catholic and you're pro-abortion.  That's two things that just don't go together.

The Catholicism in this story is treated very lightly.  It's almost as if they just used Christianity as a cool looking backdrop for Constantine to eradicate things in.  The Crucifix-looking gun was rather silly looking, but Constantine did have some other nice weapons in his arsenal.

Once again, a well-known angel plays the fall guy and much like in films like ""The Prophecy,"" everything boils down to the baddie-supreme:  Satan(a.k.a. Lucifer, Beelzebub, the Devil, Angel of Light, etc.).

While I won't say that everyone will enjoy this film, I'm sure fans of modest action flicks will enjoy this.  Some Catholics will probably be turned off by the sacrilege and the ability of Satan to do certain things in the film.  However, if you take this flick for what it is worth, which is a popcorn-ish adult action/horror yarn, you'll be sure to enjoy it.",1121904000,10,1829,4.773885350318471

He makes a fool out of himself with a performance that lacks conviction and lacks presence. He makes the movie a real challenge to watch and add to that problem a director that lacks the know how to stage a scene that has an even flow and a script that is so uneven, and you have a disaster in the making.  Is the movie a true disaster? Almost, and that's because it has a powerful and complex performance by Rachel Weisz that almost makes you forget about the disaster that is happing right in front of you. She is able to make you not only care about what is happing in the film but will make you want to sit though it in order to see what will happen with her story. Unfortunately for her, the script really does nothing to further her character's plight along and you can see that she is clearly trying to stay interested with her part, which is the same frustration you will a have in trying to stay interested in the movie.

To put it all in perspective, Rachel Weisz is the movies only godsend but other than her great effort to bring more to this film than either Keanu or the director try to do, the movie is a disaster from top to bottom.",1121904000,4,1285,4.240816326530612

The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness.

He's not British, a crucial aspect of his character. And he doesn't smoke anywhere near enough.  But if you can ignore all that, this actually is a pretty decent movie.  The visual effects are sharp and the stylized look and colors make everything seem a little otherwordly, which adds to the ambience nicely.  It was also interesting as a fan of the comic to see aspects of many different story lines in there.  There were even some scenes and dialogue lifted right off the page, the camera framing it into a moving comic panel.

Could the acting be better in some instances?  Sure but most genre films have a couple cringe worthy part.  Is the movie laughably melodramatic and cliched at times?  Ibid, see above. Do they completely change some characters?  Just look at Chas for your answer.  But I think it will surprise you if you give it half a chance.

Keanu Reeves lacks the acting chops to pull off his character's moral dilemma and the screenplay lacks credibility with its juvenile dialog and halfhearted views on the subject that it's trying to cover. It's more and less a big budget version of the television show ""Angel"" but with out it's cleaver writing or it's interesting look at the war between Good versus Evil. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks coherency and certain scenes don't jell in terms of narrative. The only actors in the movie who manages to transient the bad script and misdirection of the director is Rachel Weisz (Runaway Jury,The Shape of Things) who does give the movie's only compelling performance and the great Peter Stormare(Cocolat,Fargo) whose five minute cameo as the devil has more meat than the main character himself. Weisz and Stourmare are about the only positive things that come out of this supernatural debacle and if the studio wanted to make good movie, they could have just focus their energies at Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmare and have the movie revolved around their characters instead of the uninspired character of John Constantine and could have made a real and scary supernatural thriller.

That honor goes to the transvestite who plays the angel Gabriel, who looks like a reject from a John Walters movie. Her performance is beyond bad and along with the embarrassing performance of the guy who plays a gay devil make this one of the worse films to ever come out of hollywood.  The only and I do mean only good performance that comes out of this waste of film stock is from Rachel Weisz( Runaway Jury,Confidance) and her performance is so good in fact that in makes the movie uneven because you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen instead of the garbage that is right in front of you.

7761591,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"""Constantine,"" had cheesy potential, but the cheese is all found in yet another misleading trailer.  The sheer laziness of director Francis Lawrence is amazing.  The editing of the film makes the story nearly incoherent.  And the script?  At one point Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) tells John Constantine (Reeves) that she fears demons have killed her (twin) sister.  Less than five minutes later she tells Constantine that she doesn't believe in the Devil!  Whoa! Doesn't someone, while filming or editing, red flag such inconsistencies?

As far as the twin sister goes, that's one red herring among many - like the Spear of Destiny, insane angels, brainless ""soldier"" demons (what's the difference?), and voodoo magicians.  Much is made here of Weisz's (the ""Mummy"" lady) performance.  I don't know why.  She simply doesn't have the lines to deliver her from the mess she's in.  Reeves?  ""Constantine"" is just further evidence that he's an earlier generation's Ben Affleck.  He can't act.  And with ""Constantine,"" and its loads of special effects, he can't be insulated (this time) from that fact.  Interestingly there are two characters that do make an impression.  Tilda Swinton as gender bent angel Gabriel, who has you wondering if Gwyneth Paltrow and David Bowie have morphed into one person, and Peter Stormare's Satan.  Stormare's performance is a particular hoot.  He looks like he wandered in from the set of ""Caberet,"" and he clearly elevates things at a moment when I seemed past caring.

She could have been a lead in a much better movie with her character other than to hold Keanu's hand and to make sure he does not forget his lines, that's how great her performance is here. Unfortunately while she is compelling in her role, the movie just does not hold your attention and you will end up feeling sorry for her for being stuck in this bad movie.

His presence lacks credibility and the reading of his lines of painfully funny in the wrong kind of way.

7761594,4,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Okay, let's face it, Keanu was not the guy who should have done this flick. Yes, he's pretty. But Constantine's character is really a down, dark guy doomed to hell. It needed an actor who could convincingly portray the emotions, that heavy negativism burying a nugget of hope that heaven might cut him some slack. I needed to see a face that reeked of internal putrefaction (the cancer, the despair) as well as obsession. We needed someone who could really dig in and pull out a performance. Keanu, photogenic as he is, even likable as he is, just can't do this. I don't believe him as a guy dying from lung cancer and well-acquainted with hellfire.

Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton are good, Rachel VERY good. Tilda seems to be ready to make a career on playing gender-benders (see ORLANDO). She has the look for it, I guess.

I kept thinking, too, that Satan should be much more beautiful (the fallen angel of light) and much more threatening. (This guy was creepy, but hardly to the levels of a Lucifer.)  This movie reminded me of The Prophecy meets The Matrix meets Spawn. (And wasn't Gabriel also human-hating in The Prophecy?) But Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer was better than this guys, hands down--seductive, yet repulsive. Bring Viggo back!

The effects were good. I enjoyed the ""vacation gone really, really bad/The Day After"" vision of hell. The demons were well done. I liked the apprentice guy, and wish they'd let him do a bit more.

Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the ending very much. Then again, I'm not averse to happy endings. :) In fact, I love them. I would have given this a three if not for the hell scenes and the ending.

Another negative: What was with the sound? About a fifth of what Keanu says is unintelligible. I had to rewind several times.

Still, I sat through it and wasn't bored, even if I wasn't astonished or thrilled to bits. It's an okay fantasy ride. It's a watchable, if not terrific, couple hours of effects-laden Hollywood.

There is no reason why people should be on here bashing the fact that this isn't true to the comic it's based on, I've never really believed in the idea that Movie Producers actually wanted to stay close to a comics story, because it's impossible simply because they're two different subsidiaries!  all right that's all I have to say.",1121817600,4,773,4.408450704225352

Anytime a story switches mediums, expect it to be different. Sometimes it's slightly different, sometimes it's drastic; either way the new medium needs to be evaluated on its own; not judged on how closely it mirrors its source.

For some reason, comicbook nerds don't seem capable of being that open minded. I've read the Hellblazer comics, and I've seen the Constantine movie, and I loved the movie--I bought it the day it came out. I did not expect the movie to be the same as the comic--I expected it to be an interpretation, and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it more than some comic nerds. The movie is well done all around--intriguing characters, an engaging plot, sharp directing and special effects, and solid action.

If you want to see a dark fantasy movie about a guy hunting demons, and you're willing to put any preconceptions of the Hellblazer graphic novels aside, you will most likely love the movie. If you still can't get over the fact that movies based on books are interpretations, perhaps you should start staying away from medium changes (including this one) and find something more productive to complain about.",1121817600,4,1314,4.857142857142857

Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character was fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several storylines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written.  Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time.

7761603,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels. He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out. So they both embark on a investigation that includes half breed demons strait out of episodes of Buffy and Angel, angels that look way too asexual for words and the devil himself, who looks like he just got back from gambling trip in Atlantic City. Now if you think that I'm being a tad over the top in my plot summery, think again. I'm actually being way too kind. Now it's very hard to start off with the good parts of the film with out addressing the very bad parts of it first and that's Keanu Reeves himself. I do think that he's a good actor with some promise but he's miscast in this role as a hardboiled and cynical private eye with supernatural connections and his sour face demeanor does not help him out with his character at all. There is a subplot that involves that his heath adds nothing to the overall story at all and his character borders between self important idiot to whiney bastard that cries to god when he does not get his way. His transformation into his Neo persona during the last act of the film takes away a lot from what the movie was supposed to be all about and just turns it into a sad parody of itself. The screenplay feels like a hack job in some places and some characters don't really serve a purpose at all other than to be killed off or to just be a part of the scenery. Some character don't really need to be in the movie at all like the character of Chaz played by Shia LaBeouf, who really adds nothing to the movie other than to be a really bad side kick to our sour faced hero and the angel Gabriel who is played by Tilda Swinton, who for starters is only in the film for about ten minutes and really adds nothing to it other than to have a really bad scene with John Constantine that will make you sit up and take notice on how bad this film really is and the last act, where her character is a part of one of the most stupid plot revelations in recent movies (it involves the devil, who is dressed like a pool hall gambler from Atlantic City.) I don't hold Tilda Swinton, responsible for this (she is a very good actress) as much as I hold the screenwriters who wrote her role because we don't really know enough about her character to be surprise with the sudden turn around that she does in the last act of the film. The screenplay itself feels like it does not know what it wants to be from time to time, switching it's tone from dark horror drama to dumb down action movie in the last fifteen minutes of the film and some of the dialog is so badly written that you are grinning your teeth to the bone when you hear it. While there are a lot of bad in this film, there are some bright spots that make the film somewhat bearable to sit though. The best of these is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which is literally holding this film together by a thin and dangling thread. She gives this movie something the script should have giving it and that something is called class. Her performance is gripping and soul searching and its what the film really should have been about if you had serious people behind scenes making it. Which is too bad because the movie would have worked much better as a standard supernatural thriller with just her character in it instead of the mind numbing mess that is presented to us here. Djmon Hounsou is great as well but he's not really in the movie much at all and his character is really just there for camp effect, not substance. The special effects are cool for what they are and they do have a visual impact but not even that is strong enough to make you forget how cheesy the film is after it ends.",1121817600,7,4184,4.2774274905422445

7761606,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Not only is it predictable, but the Catholic ""theology"" that constitutes a major plot point in this movie is all wrong.  We hear throughout how suicide is a mortal sin, and suicides go straight to hell.  Newsflash, scriptwriters:  The Catholic church has not considered suicide a mortal sin for decades, so to have bishops and other people in-the-know in this film spouting that nonsense is pretty ridiculous.

This is a pretty typical special-effects action movie, only with demons.  It's entertaining enough, but hardly the sort of movie you'll watch twice, unless you have extremely low standards, or your only other choice is a made-for-t.v. movie on the Lifetime Channel.

Much of what goes on in the movie isn't fully explained.  We never find out, for instance, why the demons that ""can't"" inhabit our world are suddenly able to...is it just because the Antichrist (or whatever he is in this movie), is coming?  He needs a reception party?  Are they on recon?  What?

These demon flicks are usually much better done with understatement.  Think Rosemary's Baby.  Think Fallen.  Rosemary was creepy.  Fallen was suspensful.  They both accomplished their objectives without a tedious over-reliance on computer effects.  Why?  Because they had good stories and interesting characters.  Someone ought to remind the suits in Hollywood that what we don't see is usually far scarier than what we do see.  And a good actor is worth a thousand computer-generated images.

Peter Stormare makes a wonderful appearance as Satan.  It is, sadly, much to brief.",1121731200,2,1552,5.124
7761607,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Calling this movie a ""comic book"" movie is almost a lie.  This movie relates to the Hellblazer comics about as much as ""Batman and Robin"" related to the Batman comics.  If you don't believe me, John Constantine is supposed to be a Brit with blonde hair.  Does that description match a very American, brown haired Keanu Reeves living in Los Angeles?  No.

Once you get past the fact that this movie is NOT a big-screen adaptation of the Hellblazer comics, I thought it was a fairly enjoyable movie.  It's basically the Matrix only in modern-day L.A. and Hell.  Keanu does a perfectly Keanu-rific job of moping his way through a movie being angry that he is going to die and go to hell because of the sins of his early life.  The difference between Keanu's John Constantine and the rest of the world is that HE KNOWS there is a Heaven and a Hell and he knows where he's going when his time is up (which is quickly approaching).

I enjoyed this movie and thought it was worth buying for anyone who is a fan of Keanu Reeves or Heaven/Hell mythology.  It was better than earlier ""comic"" movies that dealt with this dark subjects (ie: Spawn) but not as good as more recent ""dark"" comic flicks such as ""Batman Begins"" and/or ""Sin City.""  If you want to watch an effects driven film, this could be for you, but if you want pure Hellblazer in movie form, don't keep your hopes up, this movie will let you down.",1121731200,,1401,4.412451361867705

You don't really give a damn about him or his problems and you actually want him to get hurt because he's such a jerk. The female cop (Rachel Weisz) who is following him during the course of the entire movie is a better character than he is and a much better actor as well. She's at least made me want to sit though the entire movie to see what will happen with her character while I was hoping for Keanu to get killed off in a very brutal way. Shia LaBeouf is also good and that's because he's not in the movie that much and he's not as annoying as he was in I Robot. The guy who played Papa Midnight was also good but he's not in the movie that much as well. The bad guys did not do much other than try to look menacing in all their digital glory and the pay off of the film is rather hooky. The story is good but the screenplay feels like it was rewritten several times because some of the actions of the characters seem sporadic in certain scenes of the film and the film is just way too dark to see a lot of what is going on right in front of you. The visual effects are good for what is expected and certain scenes do hold a resonance but that's really it. I hold much respect for the efforts made by Rachel Weisz, the guy who played Papa Midnight and to a lesser degree Shia LaBeouf (a little of him does go along way) But Keanu Reeves fumbles really bad in his role and let them and the audience down with a performance that will probably be a pinnacle of his career.",1121644800,6,1724,4.058651026392962

Unfortunately, while she is doing her best, the film lets her and the audience down with it's last act which is so painfully contrive that you will be in the doctors office the next day because you would have rolled your eyes once too many times at the stupid plot revelations and really bad dialog that accompanies the film's lackluster climax.

The only three actors who do make it out of the film with there dignity intact is Rachel Weisz, who I agree with almost everybody gives the films only great performance, Djmon Hounsou, who makes a more believable sorcerer than Keanu Reeves and Peter Stormare, who's brief appearance does more for the climax than the stupid gun fight that rips off The Matrix.

I'm not as hard as a lot of people are on Keanu Reeves because I think he has a certain charm to him but I have to agree with the majority that he is sourly miscast in the role of John Constantine. He does not come across well and his brooding streak does not fit the character at all. He acts more like Batman than the charming and humorous John Constantine of the comic books and the performance he gives is not very good at all because of it. The story is not very compelling at all and it feels like it was rush into production with out a single rewrite to put things in order because everything feels like it has no structure at all. The special effects also feel rushed and certain scenes actually feel awkward because of the direction, which is pretty bad. The ending of the film contradicts the beginning and the plot lines concerning certain characters especially John Constantine himself doesn't really fit the movie at all. The only thing that worked in this film is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which not only kept the movie from spiraling into its own vat of stupidity but also made the movie a lot more compelling than it really was.  Weisz gave this movie more dignity and substance than it deserved and her performance really does deserve a better movie than this because it's the only real thing about the entire film. You actually believe in her character and her struggles with her own faith while you don't buy the story that she is stuck in.  Rachel Weisz truly deserves all the praise she has garnered for this film and our sympathy as well for being the only good thing about it.

While it had its horrific moments, I wanted to see this film because I wanted to see how Hell, devils and angels were represented. (I happened to love PROPHECY as well -- the one with Christopher Walken as a lethal Angel Gabriel) and this picture reminded me of it. I thought Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast. A flawed hero. And his verbal exchanges with the the Supernatural Hosts were sharply funny and darkly witty.

I give it a 4 because I thought there should have been more of a backstory to that Knife they found at the beginning of the film, that monster of bugs was too CGI and I couldn't figure out about Hounsou's special chair. Some memorable moments were the passwords you require to get into Hounsou's bar, Lucifer's whole scene; the use of Holy Weaponry. The atmosphere of the picture gave me some idea of what its like to Be John Constantine. The person I saw this pic with was a Jesuit and he loved it. He's buying the DVD because its so full of fascinating detail that only a Jesuit would appreciate (its apparently very popular at the seminary.)

His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happing. Makes no sense but that's some of the inconstancies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now.

Keanu Reeves looked like he was trying to figure out how to get out of the movie more than put any effort into his character.

I guess the next place to look at would be the plot. Most of the time it will leave you going ???????????? There really wasn't much of a story and the movie seemed to drag on, it was slow and dull. When there were any scenes with action they were really unimpressive and could leave you yawning.

Last and least were the special FX, again unimpressive. The FX look like something that came out of a direct to video movie, which this should have. They demons looked like cartoon characters and the parts where they tried to make it look the Matrix failed big time. While I'm no fan of the Matrix(I couldn't even make it through the first one) the effects work well for it, not this movie.

Yes, one could argue Keanu Reeves' acting prowess (or lack thereof), but the fact is it wasn't as bad as people say. The only real complaint I have is the role given to that 'Disney' kid- Shia Lebouf (sp) or whatever his name is. If I see him play the bumbling sidekick in one more movie I think I'll do myself in. Other than that, check your logic (and acting expectations, and religion) at the door and do try to have fun.",1120694400,4,977,4.174603174603175
7761635,2,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Constantine is an adaptation of the classic DC Comic book called Hellblazer and a half hearted one at that because only names of the characters are the same, not the story or the origin of what the book was really about. Keanu Reeves literally gives his middle finger to the fans of the comic with a bad performance that lacks the charm and the smarts of his comic counterpart. He's so bad in the role that he makes the movie into a complete joke. The special effects are not very good and most of the other performances by the actors runs the gamut from being decent to flat out horrible. The only actor who comes away with a great and powerful performance is Rachel Weisz, who not only gives this movie an unnecessary amount of class and respect but also gives it the only real and human performance in the entire film. She's so good in this movie that if you had a real director and some real scriptwriters, She could have made a better lead character in a much better and serious film than this.

My two stars go to Rachel Weisz's performance alone. The rest of the film does not warrant even one",1120694400,6,1100,4.365853658536586

This is not his fault because he can be a good actor when he has the right material but he's not working with a full deck here and he's as bad as the film itself. The rest of the film is as bad as he is with a story that makes no sense and direction by music director who does not know the hell he is doing with the movie he's making. Some plot points go no where in terms of furthering the story a long and certain revelations don't makes any sense at all with the overall story. The special effects are not handled well and you really can't see much of the movie at all with how dark it is. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare do well with what they got and they both make this film bearable with their better than the script performances. Weisz deserves all the praise she is getting for her performance, and that's really because she's does give a better performance than the movie as a whole and Stormare does well with his ten minute cameo and does a better job with his role than most of the actors in the entire film.

7761641,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"Overloaded supernatural thriller that manages to not only insult the people who are fans of the comic book which this film is based on but insults the audience with one of the worse written and feebly plotted films in history. You will not only take apart this film for it sheer lack of a story but you would want to take Keanu Reeves head off for giving one of his worse performance ever in a major film. He's so bad in fact that you just would want to turn away from him every time he is on screen because of how bad his performance is. The really sad thing about this film is the fact that there are two very good performances that almost makes you want to like the movie you are watching. The first and best of these performance belongs to Rachel Weisz, whose dark and rich performance as a homicide cop makes you take a pause and wonder on how much potential this film could have had if they could have just centered the film around her and her character. She not only gives an amazing performance but also almost redeems Keanu's horrible acting as well, which is not a very easy thing to do. I agree with almost every review written that she is not only the best thing about the movie but she is its real heart and soul. The second good performance in the film belongs to Peter Stormare, who very, very brief role as the devil himself has more scares and more tension than the movie itself.  He's not only campy but sly and dangerous as well and his brief introduction at the end of the film almost saves the last act of the movie, which is ruined by a very bad plot point that makes absolutely no sense at all and was not even hinted at during the course of the entire film. Unfortunately for both Weisz and Stormare plus the audience themselves, the movie is more of a showcase for very bad computer effects that loses it's impact after the first three minutes of the film than a character study on good and evil and that's where the movie falters. It rather insult the audience than treat them with respect and if they had better people behind the scenes making this film, this would have been a real movie with some substance other than a over flashy Keanu Reeves film with no soul.

Imagine how good this film would have been if you had the good script, tight direction and based it around Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare great performances. That would have been golden.",1120435200,8,2381,4.36036036036036

I am just completly fed up with them, I mean imagine how the MATRIX TRILOGY would sound in DTS, you name some other Warner bros titles that deserve high quality sound...this pathetic Dolby Digital 5.1 is good, don't get me wrong, but if you people who don't know what DTS is go here (...) to summerize DTS...the bitrate is much higher than Dolby Digital, in other words it sounds louder and more clear, So clear you can hear the diffrence.  Believe DTS is a great technology for DVD, its a shame warner bros doesn't think so, i'm really fed up with WB.

It not only rips off a much better horror movie of yesterday (The Prophecy) but it also does it pretty badly with a script that is very poorly written and pretty bad special effects that are not up to the standards that we are all accustom to (The best of these scenes are in the trailer). I agree with the majority of the views express here that Rachel Weisz does transcend this horrible film with her fine and powerful performance but she's really alone in this film in terms of the finer points that this film really had. She is so good in this film that you actually want to like this movie because of her great and game performance but with a dumb and poorly written script and a bad performance by Keanu Reeves, you actually feel sorry for her for being in this film instead.

Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character was fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several storylines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written.  Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time.  I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original.

""Constantine"" is about John Constantine - a man trying to buy his way into Heaven with the extraordinary gifts of being able to see and talk to supernatural beings and being able to perform exorcisms. He meets a young detective who is investigating the death of her twin sister. As the plot progresses you are able to see that things are on a much grander scale than originally thought.

This movie brings many things into play other than good acting and special effects. Despite the other reviews, Keanu Reeves does a very good job in this film and it is by no means a ""Matrix"" rip-off.

It was confusing at times but I think that this movie is deeper than most say. The movie is about John Constantine, a man that can see dead people that walk on earth. He thus has to take them back to hell where they belong. The beautiful Rachel Weisz co stars also as someone who believes that the ""suicide"" of her sister isn't a suicide. The way that Constantine travels to Hell is really neat and original and the fight scenes are really neat, as he has some really cool weapons. The bible is also referenced in the movie but this isn't the same bible. This one has a ""deleted"" section where it speaks about the son of the devil. The movie is very original and neat and if you ignore some very confusing moments, you'll like it. But, no one else did, so I guess I'm a SPECIAL CHILD! I'm the same guy though that dissliked Scarface and Taxi Driver, so you kmow..

I also found something very neat about this movie. At the death of the devil's son, I noticed that he posed no resistance and just died. So, I saw in a weird way a parallel between Jesus and him as they both went down without resistance to accomplish a mission.

Now this is an interesting premise but the biggest problem this film faces in the casting of Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the hill. It also does not help that his performance is as wooden as ever in this film, not to mention the fact that his character is more of a selfish jerk than a person that you can root for and not to mention the fact that he is also the most underwritten character in the entire movie.  You don't really care about him at all and you really don't want to spend any more time with him as well. His leading lady Rachel Weisz steals the movie from right under him and the rest of the so-so cast with a tight and strait forward performance that is soulful and gripping but the movie unfortunately is not as deep as her performance and it tilters between juvenile and self parody. The screenplay at one point of the film does an about face and contradicts all that was explain earlier in order for certain thing to just happen for the sake of the climax, which is not very good to begin with.

Keanu Reeves is painfully miscast, as the hero in this film and his performance is almost as bad as the dialog in this film. You don't take his character seriously at all and you just have to make fun of him during the course of the film because of how bad his performance really is. You don't know if he is putting you on with his performance or he is really taking his role seriously which is in fact a even bigger crime that just a bad performance. He is easily upstage by the great performance of Rachel Weisz, who seem like she was working on a better film other than the movie you were watching and you hoped that the film would automatically change to see that film because her performance is literally too good for this film, which is the biggest crime of all because you would end up wishing that you could just spent some time with her character instead of watching the garbage that is right in front of you. Peter Stormare is fine but he's not in the film at all really and his character is the second best character in the whole film right next to Weisz's.  His interpretation of the devil is quite original but he is reduce to a few minutes of screen time while we have to suffer with Keanu playing hero and a cast of characters that should have been drastically cut down because a few of them don't serve a purpose at all in this film.

If you are looking for brainless entertainment, I suggest you rent something other than this because brainless entertainment is at least entertaining. This movie is only held together by a great performance of Rachel Weisz and a great character performance by Peter Stormare, who should have been more of a lead than Keanu was.",1118188800,20,1914,4.3887323943661976
7761666,3,B01GJQCZ7Y,"People have been giving this movie either 5 star or 1 star reviews, but to be honest, the movie cannot be put into either extreme.  It's middle of the road action/horror fare.

Keanu Reeves has somewhat wooden acting, but anyone who's seen a Keanu Reeves movie will tell you that wooden acting is simply how he does things, and in that respect, this is one of his better depictions of a character since Ted Theodore Logan.  His character is one confronted with his own fate and hates everything for it, and anyone who saw the movie must have seen that in Keanu's performance.  If you say it was stiff, well, yeah it was a little stiff, but this is not meant to be an award-winning drama.  This is an action movie, and the acting always comes off a little stiff in action movies.

Some of the other characters and plot devices, I'll admit are a bit cheezy, but no more so than in any other action movie (people who disagree are advised to view any Arnold, Stalone, or Willis movie ever made).  So if you're one to toot your horn and scream that the movie was contrived at the top of your lungs, then maybe you should stop to consider that the message the movie was trying to give was not about religion, but rather ""battling demons looks cool, and deus ex machina, while contrived, provides for a fun change of pace to an action movie.""

So in the end don't take this movie for more (or less) than what it is.  It's an action film about killing demons starring Keanu Reeves, with decent effects, a pretty good supporting cast, and a pseudo twist ending loosely based on a comic book character.  For anyone who's read the comic, you must realize that it isn't exactly bursting with action.  In that respect maybe you can see why it deviated so much from the source material.",1118188800,4,1772,4.438271604938271

It takes the book's premise and literally steps on it for the sake of milking it for a cheap affect. Keanu Reeves is miscast and his performance is so bad, it's vile.  He has a charm but it does not come across here in this film and he looks like he's making a joke out of his performance. Rachel Weisz does carry this movie on her shoulders by giving it its only good performance but she gets no support from the script and the direction, which is flimsy to say the least. The story is incoherent and the screenplay is a mess. The Special Effects were done better before in other movies and the cinematography is shot way too dark to see some times.

Worth a look just for Rachel Weisz's better than the film performance but other than her great effort to be better than the horrible script, the rest of the film lacks not only her professionalism but her grace as well",1118016000,12,1016,4.37037037037037
7761668,1,B01GJQCZ7Y,"I saw this film a few months ago and I have to say that I was disappointed with it. The special effects are terrific but the story needed a lot more work and Keanu Reeves was just the wrong man for the role. The character of Angela played by the always great Rachel Weisz is actually a much better character than Keanu's and would have been a better lead as well if you had people who really cared about what they were doing in this film and Djmon Hounsou is also very good as Papa Midnight and I found his character also more integral to the story than Keanu's. At least you knew where he was coming from and he had a more lively personality than the bored stiff composure of Keanu's John Constantine and Peter Stormare gives a lively yet somewhat campy turn as Satan himself. The ending is ok but the revelation concerning a character is not well done because of the fact that we only see that character for about one scene during the course of the whole film and then suddenly you're suppose to believe that the character was a major player, which in fact the film really does not explain at all towards the end.

Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz, Djmon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare for giving their best efforts to this movie but thumbs down to the lazy acting of Keanu Reeves and to the movie itself for not trying to be better than what was on the script.",1118016000,14,1353,4.305882352941176

It tries to be a mixture of horror, suspends and action but it just ends up very uneven in it's narrative and you just lose patience with it after while. Keanu Reeves is simply miscast in the lead role and he turns in a very tired and lackluster performance that does drag the movie down a lot. The character he plays is also a problem because he's such a whiney jerk and you just really can't stand him at all. You are left wondering on why he's even in the film in the first place because he character really adds nothing to the story other than the stereo typical climax where he flexes his muscles in order to fight the bad guys. The rest of the characters in the film don't fair any better with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to turn in a great performance despite having Keanu Reeves making a fool out of himself right next to her. She gives this movie a real sense of earthy realism and unnecessary creditability with a performance that deserved a better movie. Djmon Hounsou is decent in a glorified cameo that really does not use his talents to it's full potential and Shia LaBeouf is doing his lame slapstick to the hill. The man or woman who played the angel Gabriel was strange looking to say the least and Satan himself looked like he just came from a Vegas lounge act. I do have to say that the special effects were pretty good and the hell dimension had it's charm but nether of them can compensate for a bad script that not only has some really bad dialog that makes some of the scenes in the film unintentional funny but has a plot development that makes no sense what so ever and has noting to do with the story as a whole. The movie has it's good points, which is the performance of Rachel Weisz and the stunning special effects but the bad far out weight the good with a tired performance by Keanu Reeves, some unintentional funny scenes with some really bad dialog and a plot development that should have been left on the cutting room floor.",1118016000,10,2033,4.338582677165355

Sheesh, if it was that bad for you why even write about it? Sure it wasn't ""perfect"" but what movie is?  Just give some decent critque of the movie with some good and bad.  Why even see something and then go on and on about how much you hate it? Move on.  There surely has to be something out there you like. And quit dissing on Keanu.  If you think he can't act, then stop watching his movies if you will continuously be disappointed.  I just don't understand people running around trying to find something to bitch about.

But to just call something ""stupid"" and then go rambling on about how bad it was, why not instead ignore the movie and go and talk about some movies that you did like and recommend them?  I swear, such negativity.  I loved this movie and I've been waiting to order it. So, stupid or no, there are plenty of movies I haven't liked, but I don't go blasting them. ?? If it isn't constructive comments, but just out and out anger about a movie, seems to me there are bigger issues at hand. Anger management maybe needed for these types of individuals.

If you don't like it, fine, but for pete's sake, go take a happy pill and watch something you do like.

It's all good, dude.  There isn't a shortage of movies out there or anything.

:-)

To each his/her own. Constantine was a creative, well acted piece of entertainment that was refreshing to view in this era of slap-happy campy remakes. It was nicely done, a breath of fresh air.  Reeves and Weisz, as well as the entire cast and crew put their all into this and for it to just be slammed out of hateful spiteful comments, that's just unecessary. I say again, go find something you do like, or be more respectful in criticizing something you don't. These whole movie review things have turned into slam fests and attacks on the creators behind the movie and I don't think that is entirely fair.  It takes much work and effort to put a movie together.  I've seen some movies I have absolutely hated but I don't go slamming everyone involved in them because you know, I couldn't do any better. Just be fair, sheesh. No movie is perfect, but just because there is so much negativity here lately, I'm five starring it.

The praise she is getting is well deserved but other than her sadly, the rest of the cast is pretty bad and they don't even try to give good performances with the roles they have, and some of them even look like they don't even want to be there.

He not only sucks the life out of every scene he's in but manages to bring the film down to his level of acting in certain scenes. Director Frances Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it. I would have liked to have learn more about her character and her relationship with her sister, which would have been a much better movie than this film was if they just could have based the film around her character instead of John Constantine. Djmon Hounsou, who was so great in the film "" In America"" only has a bit part here and he does well with it but I would have rather had him play a much bigger role than he was allowed to play in this film. Peter Stormare, who was so great in the movies ""Birth"" and ""Chocolat"", gives quite an unusual take of the devil. Unfortunately, he's not in the movie very much at all. The special effects are good but the way hell is represented here is more a variation of the sets that was used in the film than something completely original.

It just won't happen.  It gets annoying hearing ""But in the comic it went like this..."" over and over again.  Get over it already.  Now, on to the movie...

I went into 'Constantine' not expecting a whole lot.  I really don't like Keanu Reeves very much.  I think of him as basically an mannequin who can talk but he's actually fine here as the lead.  But I thought the premise of the film(yes fanboys, based on the comic 'Hellblazer')sounded interesting.  After watching the film, I was pleasantly surprised with it.  There was plenty of stylish action scenes that are very well done.  But the reason to see 'Constantine' is for the special effects.  They are absolutely amazing, some of the best I think I've ever seen, especially the shootout near the end of the film.  They are seamless.  As for the rest of the film: none of the acting was really that great nor was it terrible, but this is a comic book movie so I wasn't really expecting it to be Oscar caliber.  They do a workman-like job and don't drag the movie down at all.  And the script is pretty well done.  There's no real slow points and there's not any cheesy dialogue, which seems to plague comic book adaptions.

Overall, 'Constantine' has an interesting little religious plot, good action scenes, some comic relief, and super-fabulous special effects.  This film is not cerebral in any sense of the word, but it is a fun, mindless way to spend a couple hours.",1117843200,5,1587,4.52112676056338

Keanu Reeves was not wrongly cast, his performance IS believable, as is Rachel W's. Lucifer delivers a grea performance also. this is a good film because it's not the typical mainstream, it's dark, different, and intelligent. the effects are beautiful especially on the angels. there is 1 negative thing to say about the effects, there is a scene where Keanu fights with a demon who seems to be in the form of insects, that is the only scene where i thought the effects lacked a realistic quality. i think some people didn't like this film because it was different, which is why i loved it. i advise anyone who like to break away from the mainstream to see it, because it's not a light hearted, happy go lucky movie. there are a few funny parts in this film though, which makes it all the better.

as for sin city, another comic based film, it was terrible, it lacked sunstance and a story, visually beautiful, but everything else was horrible. i only say this becasue in other reviews, constantine has been compared to it. in sin city, it seems all the director wanted to do for 2 and a half hours was to just shoot usually naked or half naked women. this may be why so many males liked it, which is a bit pathetic. there is no plot, it was such a waste of time.

Rachel Weisz does do wonders with the script and her role and the universal praise she is getting is well deserved but she gives the only good performance in the entire movie while the rest of the actors in the film can't rise above the bad material they are given.

The movie is horrible and Keanu can't act to save his life. From the horrible first exorcism scene to the bad ending, the film just does not find itself in a good position to entertain you, not to mention keep you awake in order to find out what happens in the end of the film. The special effects are decent but it does not make the film any better and in certain spots take away from what this film was really about, which in essence is nothing interesting at all. Rachel Weisz's performance is the best thing about this movie and that's a miracle in itself because of how bad the script is written.  She's so good in this film that you really do end up wishing that she and her character could some how escape the movie and that she could take you with her because her performance is more interesting than the entire film as a whole.

Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several storylines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written.  Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere else is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you to sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time.  I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original.

Don't get me wrong, Hellblazer was a great comic, but I think the darker version of John Constantine is more entertaining. I geuss I only have two problems with this:

1. although this is a good adaptation, I wish they had kept more of the political and religous satire that made the comics so great.

2. They never really explained what that guy in Mexico was doing when he found the spear of destiny, that really bugged me.

He does not come across well and his brooding streak does not fit the character at all. He acts more like Batman than the charming and humorous John Constantine of the comic books and the performance he gives is not very good at all because of it.

The special effects also feel rushed and certain scenes actually feel awkward because of the direction, which is not bad but could have been more original than it was. The ending of the film contradicts the beginning and the plot lines concerning certain characters especially John Constantine himself doesn't really fit the movie at all. The only thing that worked in this film is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which not only kept the movie from spiraling into its own vat of stupidity but also made the movie a lot more compelling than it really was.  Weisz gave this movie more dignity and substance than it deserved and her performance really does deserve a better movie than this because it's the only real thing about the entire film.

You don't care about him as a person at all and you just want to hit at some points of the film because of his stupidity.  Anti-heroes have a reason for their behavior and have the right kind of sympathy for their characters as well for the audience to care about what they are doing but you really don't care about Reeves character at all and you don't give a damn about what happens to him because there is really no back story to hold what he is doing as reasonable.  He's actually not very important to the story at all and is just there to fill space. The movie actually could have worked better with Rachel Weisz's character as the lead because she at the very least makes you care about what is happening with the film and what will happen with her character as well. Weisz not only deserves all the praise she has been getting from those who have seen the film but her performance is actually way too mature for this sloppy film to handle. She gives a very complex and sophisticated performance with a very deep rooted character that has more levels of reality than this movie has and that's where the movie fails because it rather be a dumb special effects film than a mature horror movie that actually makes you think about what is going on. Weisz's performance not on makes you think but makes you wish that you were seeing a better film with just her character in it. The story makes no sense at all because it contradicts itself on several occasions and has a couple of loose plot points that does not further the story at all. It also has a big revelation at the end that makes no sense what so ever and is not even hinted at doing the course of the first three-quarters of the film.  There was a lot of potential for this to be an excellent film but with a very bad screenplay and a lackluster performance by Keanu Reeves, the film really had a up hill battle to be any good and in a sense, it is because of Rachel Weisz's amazing performance but she is basically by herself in what is any good this movie really has.",1116979200,12,2492,4.264270613107822

OK, I know I have slightly digressed and should return to the matter at hand. This movie is a desecration to the comic book, the action scenes were dumb almost to the point of sheer hilarity, that lady cop talked like a retard who got turned down from competing in the special olympics, that Satan dude looked gayer than Richard Simmon's shorts, and anyone who spent their hard-earned money to see this atrocity of a film should be entitled to a full refund.",1116892800,2,801,4.569444444444445

To the contrary: part of what makes the movie captivating is the main character's jaded, unimpressed, business-as-usual approach to battling demons.  We also get a frisky Gabriel and a droll Satan.  I loved the originality. The movie is a character study, an exploration of good and evil, a tale of redemption, and a bunch of fun. I don't believe in Catholicism or Hell, but I appreciated the fact that the movie had a point-of-view on these issues, and I enjoyed watching the characters struggle within its framework. Keanu is well-cast and delivers a spot-on performance as a cynical, reluctant hero.  His restraint is a necessary balance to the extravagance of some of the other characters, notably the fabulous Tilda Swinton. Keanu-bashing is a tired old sport for lemming-minded critics.  I enjoyed Keanu's performance in this movie as much as I liked him in ""Hardball.""  Redemption movies don't work unless the actor is credible when he behaves badly, and credible when he reaches for something better within himself.  Not every actor can do this.  Keanu can.

The screenplay is a jumbled mess and it contradicts itself in certain scenes of the film and some of the performances are not up to par. There is some good in the film and that is mostly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, and she does more for it than the movie does for her. I actually cared about her character more than I cared about John Constantine and if I were the screenwriter of this movie, I would have cut John out altogether and just focus the movie on her. For one, it would have cut about half of the unnecessary characters that is in the film but also might have made the movie more focus in its plot because her character has more of a reason of being in the movie than Keanu's, who is just there for the mandatory overblown climax, which in itself incoherent because it raises more questions than the movie wants to answer.
