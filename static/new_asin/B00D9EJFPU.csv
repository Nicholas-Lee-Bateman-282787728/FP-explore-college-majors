8590875,5,B00D9EJFPU,"This little guy keeps you on the edge of your seat!!  Not the sort of (boy next door) any one would want as a neighbor..  Love this sort of story line, and with this did not feel as if it were a waste of money.  Was one that I did not shut off five minutes in to.",1395619200,,263,3.5789473684210527
8590876,2,B00D9EJFPU,I only gave this movie 2 stars because it is one of my favorite genres: horror.  Everything about this movie is not done very well.  Oh well.  At least the title is a bit titillating.,1388448000,,183,4.171428571428572
8590877,2,B00D9EJFPU,"RLJ and Image Entertainment are known for giving independent filmmakers an avenue to get their movies out to the masses. They continue this trend with the supernatural thriller ""Aberration."" While not as bad as it could be, it comes across as a TV-movie-of-the-week designed for Lifetime to show during the Halloween season.

Christy Dawson sees dead people. Lately, she's been catching glimpses of the ghost of a boy. He's warning her where certain students in her high school are going to turn up murdered. It becomes obvious that someone close to Christy is taking out her childhood friends. Can she figure out what the specter of the boy is warning her about before she meets her own end?

""Aberration"" looks good visually. It's just that nothing out of the ordinary happens in it as far as the story or scare tactics are concerned. Audiences are beyond the thrills provided to them here. ""The Conjuring,"" ""The Grudge,"" and other films like them have ruined the child ghost sub-genre as we know it. Filmmakers have a tough road ahead of them from here on out when it comes to these types movies.

Although the movie isn't rated, I would give it at least a PG-13. There's no nudity, but some sexual content is seen and insinuated. There's bad language, violence, and mild gore as well.

As usual, there are no special features included on this RLJ/Image release of ""Aberration."" Very rarely do we get any sort of bonus material for movies they distribute. It would be nice to see a ""making of"" featurette or hear some audio commentary from the cast and crew about their adventures making the film. I also wish subtitles were provided for the company's DVD releases since I use them all the time for my own personal reasons.

The only people who will be frightened by ""Aberration"" are those that don't watch horror movies or supernatural thrillers on a regular basis. If they occasionally take in one while sitting around on a Sunday evening watching Lifetime, this will provide them with ample moments to jump out of their seats in terror. Hardcore horror fans need to scroll past this one when adding items to their IMDb Watchlist.",1382486400,3,2135,4.775067750677507
8590878,3,B00D9EJFPU,This had a great story with mediocre acting with some cheesy lines.  I really enjoyed the story bummer the acting was up to par.,1381708800,2,128,4.333333333333333
8590879,4,B00D9EJFPU,"I picked up this movie not too long ago.  Got a chance to finally watch it.  It's pretty solid, through and through.  Definitely worth checking out.",1381363200,2,148,4.615384615384615
8590880,5,B00D9EJFPU,"This is an amazing psychological thriller. It brings together the paranormal, sports, mystery and the normal trials of being a teenager. Murder in a small town requires a supernormal solution.",1381363200,2,192,5.433333333333334
8590881,1,B00D9EJFPU,"This was a waste of money!  The plot was weak, the acting was horrible and the make-up of the so called ghosts looked like something out of Disney's haunted mansion.  Not scary at all!!!!",1380758400,5,187,4.470588235294118
