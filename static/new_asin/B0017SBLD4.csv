8366893,2,B0017SBLD4,"Actually, NO English subtitles are optioned (on this offering).  Picture quality only Fair (at best). Most of the other 'classic' Soviet movies have been more or less restored (except ""Earth"" and most ""Earth"" (""Zemlya"") offerings have better picture-quality than this one).  Otherwise, characterization and narrative is straight-forward, remarkably easy to follow, with good audio/sound-delivery.  The ""Jap"" is very stereotyped (as Soviet directors effectively portray the ""Other"" (even more so than found in American wartime-movies)! All too brief spectacle of 4-engined Tupolev's in mass-formation/para-drops: last few-minutes at the end! (Recommended with caution if you don't understand Russian.)",1330646400,,700,6.270833333333333
