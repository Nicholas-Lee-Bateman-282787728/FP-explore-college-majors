222584,4,6300185176,"Gambit is a marvelous film full of style as well as substance. Much as I'd like to discuss the plot, I dare not because much of the film's special surprises stem directly from telling the plot. So just trust me when I say grab it- if for no other reason the exotic locales, Shirley MacLaine's beauty, charm, and smarts (not to mention the stunning wardrobe by costumer Jean Louis), and the fun interplay between MacLaine, relative newcomer Michael Caine, and the urbane and charming Herbert Lom. A perfect film for the Sunday afternoon you're not going anywhere.",1058227200,14,562,4.804123711340206

222616,5,6300185176,"Very surprising the first time you watch it and it doesn't wear thin after watching again and again even though by then you know all the twists and turns. I am NOT a Shirley MacLaine fan but I thought she did a fantastic job as the surprising Nicole -- recruited to be a minor (and silent) partner in an elaborate heist planned down to the last detail by Harry (a very fine Michael Caine) to steal a valuable sculpture from a businessman he assumes to be reclusive and unsophisticated. Harry's elaborate plan quickly begins to unravel and only Nicole's beauty, wits and unexpected talents save the day ... or do they? Throw in a light romance and several twists and it makes for wonderful entertainment. An attempt to take the concept and remake the movie failed spectacularly in 2012, not only because of the change in the basic story's premise and a decision to make its humor much broader, but also because Cameron Diaz and Colin Firth (sorry Mr. Darcy) could not generate the same level of believability as MacLaine and Caine did in the original. I highly recommend this movie.",1419465600,2,1081,4.664921465968586

222620,5,6300185176,"Which was the line that GAMBIT featured in the ads when it was released. If this seems unusual, it is.  GAMBIT takes a standard caper movie and stands it on its head, mainly by making it collide with the always random ""real world"" rather than what the plotters expect.  This make for great fun and some wonderful performances by Shirley Maclaine, Michael Caine, Herbert Lom (in a nice departure from the perpetually harassed Inspector Dreyfuss) and Philip Abbott.

Altogether a lovely confection of a film and a nice antidote to the many ""big heist"" movies that take themselves seriously!",1411257600,,588,4.91919191919192
222621,5,6300185176,"I waited for this one to come out on DVD for many years.  It's the old 60s comedy film with Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine as a cat burglar and the dancer he hires for a very special reason, as you will come to find out if you haven't already seen it.  They're great together.  Really original plot line, fun to watch.  I've viewed it at least a dozen times over the years.  I heard that they made a remake in 2014 with Colin Firth (whom I love) and Cameron Diaz, but I haven't seen it yet.  I just would find it hard to believe it's as good as the original though.  Watch this version, you'll enjoy it.",1409788800,4,607,4.093220338983051
222622,5,6300185176,What a great movie; they don't make them like that any more.  3 of my friends and I (2 of them born years after this movie was made) had lunch and watched the film together.

Maybe our favorite scene in this one is her entry into the cage.  Overall, we thought that the 2012 version 'worked' better - the resolution was more satisfying, and we liked the fact that Harry wasn't quite as bumbling as he appeared (whereas in the original, he was).

Why can't they make more movies like this...(again, you know how old I am.)  Yes, I very much recommend this, unless you've already seen it on TV, which some of my younger friends have; hopefully it was not edited!  Clever story, unexpected twist, which lays the foundation for the humorous-ness that follows.  Not sure, but I think the costumes were by Edith Head; if not, they were quite beautiful nonetheless.  Shirley M. does them all justice; and Michael Caine was the perfect fit for the character he plays.",1405036800,,629,4.571428571428571

I liked this the first time I saw the movie. I'm glad I can watch it on my iPad now. Living in Japan, most movies we can easily buy are dubbed in Japanese.

222632,5,6300185176,"The 1st ""Gambit"" with Shirley MacClaine and the latest ""Gambit"" with Cameron  Diaz were  both enjoyable.  They had a similar premise but yet two different story lines. Shirley was a call girl stranded in Hong Kong without a passport and Cameron was a rodeo cowgirl. Shirley  posed as a look-alike for a tycoon's deceased wife and Cameron posed as the owner of a priceless Monet painting that was fake. Both movies were scams to swindle a tycoon out of a priceless artifact.  Both had surprise endings that were not similar and well worth watching. I highly recommend them both.",1401667200,,577,4.787878787878788

222646,5,6300185176,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an action and suspenseful film. This isn't the type of film that can be compared to Mission Impossible, for example, but it is a definite solid outline for modern day action films as such. I chose five out of five stars because the main characters are developed to detailed multidimensional levels, that you neither like or dislike their incentives, nor do you feel obligated to judge them for which class of society they come from. The characters themselves choose to coexist in harmony. I loved, for example, the curt handling of the statue in the end and the various metaphoric roles it plays in social obligation, including art and politics. I definitely recommend this to viewers of all ages!",1376006400,,747,4.84375
222647,4,6300185176,"Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine come together in this zany caper film to pull off the heist of a lifetime. Everything is plotted in perfection down to the last detail and there is no way it can possibly fail.  Or is there?  Caine is debonaire as the mastermind.  Maclaine is a fairly sophisticated Eurasian ""entertainer"" that Caine entices to join him in his ""gambit"".  Herbert Lom is very effective in his role as a cultured, accomplished, very wealthy mark.  Shirley is a dead ringer for the dead wife Lom has mourned for years.  Caine contrives for them coincidentally to meet with larceny on his mind.  And Away We Go!  But it's not going to be as easy as he imagined.  CLEVERLY PLOTTED and great fun.  The ONLY THING CERTAIN about this ""caper"" is the GOOD TIME you'll have watching it play out.  This is one you'll want to watch more than once, and no they don't make 'em like THIS anymore.",1365811200,,898,4.515527950310559
222648,5,6300185176,"In the caper category, 1964's TOPKAPI probably remains the classic example of the genre.  But this sleek gem that came along in 1966 I would vote a close second.  The plot takes its inspiration from a true historical incident--the snatch of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911 (not to worry, it was recovered two years later).  But the dull heist of La Gioconda--the thief was a janitor at the Louvre who simply put the painting under his jacket and walked out with it--is only a springboard as the film takes off with wildly inventive twists and turns before it comes in for a landing with no less than six--count 'em, six--surprise endings in a row.  Along the way, there is, of course, a sparkling battle of the sexes.  Caine envisions MacLaine as merely a mute tool in his grand scheme.  Hardly!  She turns the tables on him in delightful ways when he turns out to be not the master thief he imagines himself to be.  Caine is hilarious as, in his wounded male ego, he grows increasingly flustered yet grateful when MacLaine's charm, quick wit and physical agility save his bacon again and again when his master plan goes awry.  When we get to the abduction from the seraglio, MacLaine's long, gorgeous legs do all the talking. The robbery sequence at the heart of the film doesn't reach the level of excruciating tension that the heist in TOPKAPI does, but is a nail-biter nevertheless.

MacLaine, one of Hollywood's biggest stars at this time, picked up-and-coming Caine as her leading man after he appeared in THE IPCRESS FILE in England, thus setting in motion his long and successful American movie career.  Caine has always expressed his gratitude to her.  She also made a crucial contribution to the script by suggesting that in the opening sequence, which initially wasn't working, her character remain silent.  The result is a smash, one of the most fun movies of the 1960's.",1365120000,,1889,4.722560975609756

222672,3,6300185176,"Gambit is a surprising and generally unknown major studio (Universal) production from 1966, a caper film with a moderate dose of romantic comedy. I love the cast more than anything else (Michael Caine! John Abbott! Roger C. Carmel! Herbert Lom! Shirley MacLaine!) especially as I have a fondness for Star Trek guest stars, but the story and direction are at times stodgy, and the cinematography typically overlit in a ""Universal"" sort of way.

Gambit is yet another screenplay in which perfect beauty meets perfect wealth. (""Sabrina"" and ""Babyface"" are earlier examples.) MacLaine plays the feminine, ""Eurasian"" object at the center of this movie -- presenting an unreal, super-idealized image of femininity that is coldly sexy and bizarre. In the first, fantasy go-around, she is like a mannequin on steroids and doesn't say a word.

The ethnic characterizations are heavy-handed, and the con game and subsequent caper are not particularly ingenious, either. Worst of all, the Maurice Jarre music score doesn't take this film seriously. This is the worst Jarre score I've ever heard, even though I knew it was his work in the first 60 seconds.

222674,4,6300185176,"One of the 'Per Request' recent releases by the major studios, who have finally realized there is good money to be made from digging into their treasure trove of forgotten films.

Hardcore cinephiles have spent years, no, decades, walking into the darkest corners of the collectibles world; dealing with the opportunistic predators that populate it and paying nose-bleed prices for video that is barely recognizable: Skittering, pan-n-scan, washed out colors, audio scratches, bad tracking; basically the crummiest early video recordings from the 1970s and 1980s repeatedly copied over and over and over and over. Enduring all of that garbage in order to watch a film that never received a post-theatrical commercial release.

The advent of DVD burners turning out One-Disc-For-One-Paying-Customer has been the blessed key that released all of us from those foul sewer pits - and I'm terribly grateful.

I'm amazed to read some complain that the prices are too high. Well, then you haven't been where I've been, heard what I've heard, and seen what I've seen. Twenty-something bucks is reasonable. I admit, it's not pocket change, but then you haven't spoken to some of these so-called dealers who demand $40-$60-$80 or more for their ""has-never-been-released"" piles of 1970s and 80s home video rips or the cleverer 8mm/16mm film repro guys who manage to obtain rare material from the 1920s-30s. You haven't had to knuckle under to these creeps, so you don't know how lucky you are at twenty-something a pop. Damn lucky.

Sorry, but this is an important moment in the history of films and I want to savor every minute of it. <g>

'Gambit' is one of these very special movies. Starring Michael Caine, Shirley MacLaine and the always enjoyable Herbert Lom, this production takes us on a humorous heist adventure in what was then the very exotic worlds of Hong Kong and Malaysia.

Caine plays Harry Dean, a short con specialist who has spied himself a very valuable bauble. The trick here is the man who owns it is a billionaire industrialist with resources and access to the most advanced security money can buy. Keep in mind that in 1966 the concept of a 'billionaire' would be the same as saying ""That guy owns the moon"". It was both bizarre and off-putting, since the concept of ultra wealthy typically meant you were a 'millionaire'. The b-word term itself was only used to describe economies of entire countries, not a single person.

So, how to obtain said bauble? Best known and oldest distraction in the grifter handbook: A beautiful woman. But this is no regular mark. Lom's character is wise, intelligent and very cautious. The distraction has to be something special. And Ol' Harry has found that special girl. Working in a cheap Hong Kong dancehall is Ms. Nicole Chang - aka the truly stunning Shirley MacLaine.

And why this particular woman? Because she's the very image of the billionaire's late wife and the ultimate bait for Harry's hook.

The plan: Accidentally bump into billionaire, attract same and quietly allow them time alone. Then cat burglar his way to the bauble and voila' - everyone is rich.

What made this so darn funny is the set-up, the first twenty minutes of the movie. Just when you think you're watching Harry's ludicrous plan going off without a hitch - it being almost too easy - you realize it actually is. It's revealed that he has yet to initiate contact with Nicole (a fun adventure in and of itself) and that everything seen up to that point had been his fanciful fantasy.

Real life isn't like that. And you know what happens to all best laid plans, things never go as expected do they? <g>

An extremely enjoyable film for heist fans. And more so for heist fans that love a romantic-comedy-adventure. Very much in the vein of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Steal-a-Million/dp/B0002B15YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Steal a Million</a>'.

222687,4,6300185176,"Fondly remembered by those who saw it back in the 60s and a treat awaiting those who have not, ""Gambit"" features delightful performances by stars Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine, as a pair of art thieves, and Herbert Lom, as their mark, an Arabian oil magnate. Except nobody is quite what they seem here, starting with MacLaine who is simply beautiful and mysterious without saying a word for the first half hour or so.

Fun as the silent Shirley is, once she starts talking, she's better. She's a clever girl, as Caine tells her, and catnip for the audience. He seems to both attract and amuse her, leaving him with a long string of slow burns. ""Do I look like a crook?"" he asks her indignantly at one point. ""A little,"" she replies, and then offers reasons. But when things go wrong in the scheme, as they do repeatedly, she saves the day. But Caine also proves a worthy improviser.

The actual robbery generates considerable ""Rififi""-style suspense, while keeping the light comic touch that characterizes the whole picture, not an easy trick to pull off. Aside from the cute romance, the nicest touch in the film is the fact that even though he knows perfectly well he's being set up, Lom comes to like the couple who have come to con and rob him.",1302652800,,1253,4.589285714285714

Caine comes across as an inventive and low-tech, if not very physical, James Bond wannabe.  Lom does a very nice job as the intended mark and gives a performance far superior to those in the Pink Panther series.

222711,4,6300185176,"In the 1960s Hollywood combined the classic ""caper"" film with a healthy dose of romantic comedy.  The result was a series of charming films such as CHARADE (1963) and HOW TO STEAL A MILLION (1966)--films that combined major stars, clever plots, witty scripts and which balanced suspense with comic and romantic complications.

Made in 1966 and released in 1967, GAMBIT was among the last of these films, and like all others in the genre it had a complex plot.  Ahmad Shahbandar (Herbert Lom) is quite possibly the richest man in the world and a recluse to boot, a man who has never gotten over the death of his beautiful Eurasian wife some twenty years ago.  Harry Dean (Michael Caine) devises a clever plan to gain access to his luxury apartment and rob him blind: he will use honky-tonk dancer Nicole Chang (Shirley MacLaine), who bears a striking resemblance to Shahbandar's long dead wife, to breach Shahbandar's defenses.

There's only one problem: it won't work.  To tell exactly why it won't work is to betray the plot, which is extremely clever; suffice to say that Dean has made a number of incorrect assumptions about both the situation and the personalities involved.  When the plot begins to twist, it does so in a truly unexpected way, taking both Dean and the audience completely by surprise.

This is the sort of film that Hollywood used to do so well but which we seldom see today, a frothy, glamorous confection with first rate production values and expert performances from major stars.  MacLaine gets top billing, and she is quite fine, but the weight of the film rests on Caine and Lom, who give memorably dry performances, and director Ronald Neame (who was responsible for a host of memorable films including THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE) keeps everything moving along at a smart pace with plenty of style.

This may not be the best of the genre--I think both CHARADE and HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, to name but two, outpace it.  But even so it is a perfectly charming film, the perfect antidote to a drab afternoon.  Just add popcorn!

A total classic from the swingin sixties, Gambit stars two absolutely adorable people: Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine. In 2012, there was a pretty funny remake, so if you liked that one, youll probably want to watch the original, too.

Its a little embarrassing, but I actually found the plot a little confusing. But if you like spy movies or heist movies, you probably won't get lost and will find it even more entertaining! For me, I liked it because I liked the two stars.

Its a perfect representation of the decade, so if you liked the Austen Powers movies, youll get a big kick out this oneyes, the 60s really were like that!
