8525960,1,B008767P9S,"The Inception Media Group released the first season of this classic series as incomplete episodes which were missing 3 and-a-half minutes per episode. This complete collection of the series will also be released by the Inception Media Group so there is a high likelihood these episodes might seem similarly incoherent because they will also be missing 3 and-a-half minutes per episode.

If you are a casual viewer, you might not mind this, but I wanted to at least make this information available to customers so that they could make up their own minds.",1351382400,5,553,4.946236559139785
8525961,5,B008767P9S,"My five-star rating is strictly for the TV series, one of my favorites back in the 1950's, and not the way this DVD release has been handled thus far.

Infinity Resources and Falcon Pictures, who released the first four seasons of the Real McCoys, never released seasons five and six.  I, and the many others who bought the first four seasons, were left hanging when seasons five and six never came out.  If we want to complete our seasons, are we expected to buy this complete set even though we already have the bulk of the series?  This new company, Inception Media Group, should release seasons five and six first, and then offer the complete set. I, for one, will not be buying this complete set just to complete my collection.",1338940800,25,732,4.564885496183206
