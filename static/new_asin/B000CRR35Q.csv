2471905,5,B000CRR35Q,"I never got to watch Ellen's show when it was actually on TV because I was living overseas and couldn't get it there.  I'm still living in Europe, but now w/DVD's I can catch up (hello - can we PLEASE have seasons 4 & 5 already??!!!  I can't take the waiting!!!!).  I have, however, seen Ellen's current talk show (""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" on NBC), and feel that in Season 3 of her series (having gotten to know her quite a bit through her current daytime show), she is being more herself - still in Ellen Morgan character - but the writing for Season 3 is largely based on her own convictions and views which are constantly brought up on her talk show, where she is completely being herself and not pretending to be any sort of character.  Aside of transparent honesty in the script-writing, the show is as funny as ever, if not funnier in many instances, and we also see the first hints of transition (sometimes not very subtle hints), where Ellen is beginning to move Ellen Morgan's character into being more open about her sexuality (not wanting to wear dresses, sporting a shorter hairdo, never having a love interest during the entire season except for REALLY wanting a certain new best friend, who just happens to be a woman, etc....).  A must for die-hard Ellen fans, but everyone must get this - you will roll on the floor laughing!!! Get It!!!",1148169600,12,1355,4.536885245901639
2471906,5,B000CRR35Q,"This Season 3 Set of Ellen is incredible.  It's like some magic thing happened at this point when compared to the first two seasons.  The writing, the pacing, the major guest stars, and the chemistry between the actors is all genius.  These shows have me uncontrollably laughing out loud.  There are so many priceless episodes in this set including the hilarious bachelorette party that Ellen and Audrey throw for Paige.  I watched that particular episode late at night and I was laughing so hard I thought I was going to wake up the neighbors.  Other highlights in this season include Ellen's  mammogram, the arrival of cousin Spence, her dinner party with Martha Stewart, and Paige's wedding.

Ellen DeGeneres, Clea Lewis, Joely Fisher, David Anthony Higgins, and Jeremy Piven give performances that rival the very best in TV.  Clea Lewis certainly hit a new high in this season.  She's so good.  She keeps you smiling and in stitches.

To make this set even better, the picture quality is a major improvement over the first 2 Season sets.  It looks and sounds great.  This Season 3 set was worth every cent.  I can't wait for Season 4.  Thank you Ellen and A&E!!",1144713600,8,1165,4.75
2471907,4,B000CRR35Q,"Ellen is so funny!  I used to watch her show every week that it was on.  And this season has one of my favorite episodes.  This is when one of Ellen's friends brings Martha Stewart to Ellen's dinner party.  It is a great episode, and Ellen is at her best.  If you are a fan of her talk show, you will appreciate the humor packed into this season!",1141862400,3,346,4.029411764705882
2471908,5,B000CRR35Q,"Definitely the turning point of the show where Ellen Degeneres defined both her character Ellen Morgan and her comic capabilities - ranging from physical, visual to linguistic comedy......add to that an eclectic pot pourri of supporting cast....from the sexually liberated Paige to the ditsy Lois, Ellen's mother whose life-dream is to find Ellen the perfect husband, this season really does come up trumps.

Season 3 also introduces the amazing Jeremy Piven as Ellen's cousin Spence, and bids farewell to Arye Gross's Adam (who really wasn't that funny).

There are too many comic moments to note, but some classics are Ellen and Lois trying to bond as mother and daughter, with disastrous results, those spoof introductions (my favourite being where they finally have an opening sequence.....the theme tune is hilarious alone) and the girls' night in where Ellen freezes her bra and chicken niblets.

I can't wait to finally have this series on DVD and anxiously await the remaining Series.  Hope they come out quicker than the year between Season 2 & 3.

Degeneres proves here why she is one of America's foremost comedians - period.  So pleased to have met her too in NYC.....now this is what comedy and good television are all about!",1138147200,19,1238,5.044117647058823
2471909,5,B000CRR35Q,"In my opinion... ELLEN SEASON THREE was by far the best season. The writing on the show's third season was so witty, quick and intellegent! Not to say the others aren't, but I do believe this was probably the show's highest point. Can't wait to get it!",1136160000,7,252,4.382978723404255

2471912,1,B000CRR35Q,"I expected something different, maybe I'm old fashioned but thought this just silly or perhaps this is the modern, senseless stuff out today.

2471916,4,B000CRR35Q,"ELLEN is great commedaine , i actually bought the whole series, and all of the episodes are funny, but i think seasons 2 and three are the funniest, so if you only buy but one season, i reccomend one of these two. although there so fuuny you'll want to buy the whole series. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1234310400,,293,4.444444444444445
2471917,5,B000CRR35Q,"Love this season.  I specifically bought this for the Martha Stewart episode.  I remember laughing so hard back then, but cannot remember some of the details. Oh boy, did I ever laugh hard when I saw the episode again after 10+ years.  The Christmas episode was also magnificent.  This season has great and original writings.",1230422400,4,325,4.8545454545454545
2471918,5,B000CRR35Q,"A very funny sitcom, with some lessons to teach along the way.  If viewed with an open mind,  this show can be laugh-out-loud hilarious.  If your mind is already closed, try opening it a little and let Ellen in;  you won't be able to keep from loving her.",1218931200,,255,4.25
2471919,5,B000CRR35Q,"Robby Benson directed every episode in this package, the funniest season of Ellen ever!!!! (Amazon -- get your product description together here -- check with the DGA -- he helmed the entire hilarious season 3!) Benson's flawless direction give Ellen the canvas to prove her Physical Comedy Hall of Fame worth here, and wow -- prove it she does!!!  With the help of one of the top casts in sitcom history, the brilliant Joely Fisher (Joely and Ellen are definited this era's Ethel and Lucy!),  Jeremy Piven (he is irresistably rude and hysterically edgy -- he cut his Entourage chops here!!!), Clea Lewis (she is so funny -- somebody hire her!!! Why isn't she working more?!!), and Dave Higgins (deliciously deadpan), plus a season full of incredible guest appearances, starting from the California earthquake leaving Ellen's bookstore in shambles in Shake, Rattle and Rumble, to the incredible physical comedy of Ellen and Joely in the two-part season finisher -- When the Vow Breaks. (This is the season prior to Ellen coming out of the closet -- and here she gave ALL women, everywhere, who were just a little different and didn't fit into what was considered the norm, an amazingly funny role model)!!!!!

8101279,5,B000CRR35Q,"I have been an Ellen fan since I saw her do a stand-up routine on HBO in the 80's. This show doesn't disappoint. I remember watching it when it originally aired and I still laugh when watching it now. My curiousity is, I bought seasons 1, 2, and 4 in 2009 and paid $12 total for all three seasons (including shipping) so why are all the seasons so expensive now? I was lucky to find season 3 for under $25 from a seller I had bought from before. I think the price is absolutely ridiculous and i recommend waiting until you see a price under $25. Season 3 was around $10 in 2009 and Season 5 was a little over $7, I can't wrap my head around them costing $70+ per season. Ridiculous. But great show and if you can find a reasonable price, definitely get it.",1364860800,4,756,4.149659863945578
