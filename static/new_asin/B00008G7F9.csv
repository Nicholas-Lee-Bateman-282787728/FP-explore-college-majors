Audio 1:  Dream Islands / Meditation

Audio 2:  Classical Relaxation

Audio 3:  Piano Dreams

Audio 4:  Echoes of Nature (natural sounds - my favorite)

The island and ocean scenery are beautiful and relaxing.  However, I often feel that there are too many humans and man-made things in the scenes, such as the photos of a cruise ship, and smaller fishing boats, and even of a jogger on the beach.  Sometimes the pictures skip around when I wish they would stay put a little longer.  However -- the DVD delivers exactly what it promises -- pictures of Islands in a relaxing way that lets you dream yourself into a tropical paradise.  I love the palms and sandy beaches and sunsets, and imagining myself miles away from the stress of work and life.  This DVD is not quite as relaxing and dreamy as the ""WAVES"" DVD's, especially the ""Hawaiian Dreams Waves"" DVD or the ""Soothing Waters California and Oregon"" DVD but it is still a good and beautifully relaxing video that truly helps you to escape.",1156118400,5,1113,4.607142857142857

The videographers instead poke around the surroundings, exploring each area from several angles as if you had been walking around yourself.  Although at times you might wish they'd spent a bit more time on that great panorama they just left, overall I like the approach.

I very much wish that they had some sort of captioning option so that you would know what you're looking at.  Unfortunately, there is no detail provided.  The musical tracks are fine, nothing stands out about them, but the focus is on the scenery.

All in all, a very nice DVD that will provide a nice escape.  This should not be used as a travelogue, or as a true relaxation video (cuts are too rapid for that).  But, if you're stuck in a snowy winter, this is perfect.",1114214400,7,919,4.6234567901234565
