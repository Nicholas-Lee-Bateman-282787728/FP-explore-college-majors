8251110,1,B0013IHTFW,"I hope this doesn't get posted twice, I wrote a review over a week ago, but it never appeared.  This movie was bad enough and so infuriating that I actually came back and wanted to write another one since the first wasn't posted.  The biggest problem is that the film does not deliver what is advertised, and what it does deliver is so brutally awful, you feel as though the director is reaching through the screen and punching you in the stomach (or perhaps slightly lower).

The film's premise, at least as it appears, is that several star wars fans get are assembled following the release of Return of the Sith to discuss the franchise.  Supposedly, this leads into conversation about a wide range of topics.  I'm a star wars fan, this sounded interesting.  This is NOT what you get.  What you get is a poorly written and horrendously acted farce, that only uses the premise of a star wars discussion as a jumping off point.  This is a dishonest film and your money and time would be better spent elsewhere.",1217980800,,1010,4.541436464088398
8251111,1,B0013IHTFW,"Awful.  Painful.  A complete waste of my time.

This is sold as if a bunch of movie-goers get picked to talk about the latest Star Wars film and then it morphs into something else.  If that were the case it may have turned out to be a good movie.

This was a scripted, poorly acted indie that used every cliche and sterotype available simply for some kind of shock value.  The acting was poor quality and the people couldn't even deliver their punchlines with conviction.

Skip this movie.  It's ghastly.",1217289600,,504,4.522222222222222
8251112,5,B0013IHTFW,I have pre ordered the movie and I am looking forward to watching this interesting premise for a conversation. I love Star Wars and can see how many real conversations can come out of this movie that apply today across the diverse audience.,1208304000,,240,4.604651162790698
8251113,5,B0013IHTFW,"If you are a Star Wars buff, you will love this film which touches on more than just galactic issues.",1203984000,,101,4.1
8251114,5,B0013IHTFW,"Interesting concept of grabbing people from a Star Wars movie line and getting them in a room talking about the film, but having all the most divisive issues of the day crop up in and around Star Wars.  It seems as though Star Wars is some sort of cultural thread that runs throughout people's consciousness tying into their opinions and beliefs on subjects from abortion to video games.

This is a very low-budget Indie film - the real deal.  If you like to hear the independent voice in film, you will like this one.",1203897600,,518,4.48936170212766
