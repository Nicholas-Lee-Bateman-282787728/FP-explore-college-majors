2876141,5,B000RXZIJS,"""Sissi sticks to me just like oatmeal""...  Romy Schneider would often use that quote when asked about the film trilogy which launched her international career.  Schneider always harboured misgivings about starring as the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, but the movies themselves (which stretch the truth in favour of fairytale fantasy) are an endless delight for romantics and followers of world cinema.  Hopefully Ms. Schneider made her peace with ""Sissi"" before her untimely death in 1982.  This box set contains all three ""Sissi"" movies (plus the dubbed SISSI: FOREVER MY LOVE and the prequel, VICTORIA IN DOVER).

In the classic original SISSI (1955), we first meet the vivacious 16-year-old princess.  At her family estate in Bavaria, Princess Elisabeth--nicknamed Sissi--spends her days riding horses, tending to her collection of animals, and hunting in the woods.  When her elder sister Nene (Uta Franz) wins an arranged marriage with cousin Emperor Franz-Joseph (Karlheinz Bohm), Sissi and her mother, Duchess Ludovika (Magda Schneider) accompany her to Austria.  But things take another turn altogether when Sissi herself meets Franz-Joseph by chance, and captures his heart.  The original SISSI is overflowing with charm, lavish costumes and breathless romance.  Schneider and Bohm spark off the screen with their strong chemistry as Sissi and Franz-Joseph.

SISSI: THE YOUNG EMPRESS (Sissi: die junge Kaiserin) (1956) picks up the story shortly after the wedding of Sissi and Franz-Joseph.  Young Sissi finds it very difficult to adjust to a structured lifestyle in the Austrian palace, following her carefree family life in Bavaria.  Adding to her stress is a love/hate relationship with mother-in-law Archduchess Sophie (Vilma Degischer), who still disapproves of Franz-Joseph's impetuous love-match.  After a dispute concerning the upbringing of her newborn baby, Sissi escapes back to her family in Possenhofen...with Franz-Joseph in hot pursuit.

SISSI: THE FATEFUL YEARS OF AN EMPRESS (Sissi: Schicksalsjahre einer Kaiserin) (1957) provides a touching finale to the trilogy.  Sissi and Franz-Joseph are blessed with a little daughter, yet life in Austria still leaves Sissi feeling restricted, so she decides to spend more time in Hungary.  Franz-Joseph spends most of his days attending to political matters at the palace, aided and abetted by his meddling mother.  In the midst of the drama comes the news that Sissi has been diagnosed with potentially-fatal tuberculosis.  Rest assured there's a happy ending in store for this charming finale of the SISSI franchise.

As mentioned above, this set also has the dubbed SISSI: FOREVER MY LOVE, a condensed version of all three movies, released to English-speaking audiences.  VICTORIA IN DOVER (Mdchenjahre einer Knigin) was released a year prior to the first ""Sissi"" movie.  Romy Schneider stars as a young Queen Victoria in this romantic drama based on her letters and diaries of the period, leading up to her engagement to Prince Albert. The film serves as a neat little prequel-of-sorts for the ""Sissi"" movies (and also co-stars Magda Schneider).

The original ""Sissi"" trilogy looks superb on DVD, faithfully restored from original Agfacolor film elements.  VICTORIA IN DOVER fares less well, with some print damage in evidence.  The English subtitling is clear and well-timed.",1198540800,37,3347,5.490234375
2876142,5,B000RXZIJS,"Thirty five years ago I was able to see the abridged film ""Forever My Love"" (while in Spain, and it black & white!). Now the entire trilogy is made available, remastered in superb Agfacolor, with the delightful Ms. Schneider showing why this 1950s signature role established her fame in the minds of so many Austrians and Germans. Of course, the movies are schmaltzy and sentimental, reflecting the kind of wonderful, even corny costume dramaticism of the 1950s. But, then, must every film be a discourse in Sartrean metaphysics? No, these films are simply an exhilarating romp in Viennese and Bavarian gemutlichkeit, with pageantry, romance, and traditional entertainment values all on display. Of course, the ""truth"" is bent to satisfy the goals of director Ernst Marischka, but that's okay, too. As John Ford has the newspaper editor say in his ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" ""Sir, when legend becomes truth, print the legend.""  These are enjoyable films in their own right, and for all those incurable romantics or secret royalists or lovers of pageantry, Sissi may be just right for you. Recommended.",1198368000,5,1110,5.0989010989010985
2876143,5,B000RXZIJS,"I saw the Sissi films many, many years ago when I still lived in Germany.  Though I have seen many films over the past 2 decades that I liked a lot, Sissi has always been my all-time favorite.  I have the VHS tapes, but no longer a Video player to play the tapes...  I am thrilled to pieces to have found the Sissi films on DVDs I can watch here in America and can't wait for them to arrive!  I should probably have waited until they got here to provide a REAL review, but I already know what I'm getting...lol.  I honestly don't think that I will ever see a film or series which could knock Sissi off the #1 spot on my favorites list.  Sissi, played by Romy Schneider and co-starring her real-life mother Magda Schneider in the role of Sissi's mother is enchanting in her innocence.  I feel rebellious with her when she has to fight against Franz Joseph's dominating mother, putting her husband in the middle.

All in all, I am completely ecstatic at having found this DVD set here!!!",1196467200,,985,4.344262295081967
2876144,5,B000RXZIJS,"This delightful trilogy tells the story of Elisabeth of Bavaria (nicknamed Sisi) who ascended to the Austrian throne at the age of 16 upon marrying her cousin Franz-Josef. In doing so, she became Empress of Austria and beloved Queen of Hungary.

Elisabeth's beauty was legendary. 17-year old Romy Schneider was perfect in the role of the enchanting, outgoing, free-spirit. She plays Sisi from the age of 15 to her mid-20s when the last film ends.

The films were made between 1955 and 1957 as an Austro-German co-production under the helm of Austrian director Ernst Marischka. They are not historically accurate. They are in the style of mid-50s romantic comedies, good-natured and innocent and with a large dose of cornball humour. To modern viewers they may appear dated, schmaltzy and yes corny.

The first film ""Sissi"" is my favourite. It has the most pageantry and is the archetypal romance with the fairy-tale ending. It begins with Elisabeth's chance meeting with the young Franz-Josef, literally ""hooking"" him while out fishing in the lakes around Austria's picturesque Salzkammergut. It chronicles their secret whirlwind romance against the wishes of their parents and ends with the lavish Royal Wedding in Vienna amidst general rejoicing.
""Sissi: Die Junge Kaiserin"" (The Young Empress) charts the first year of her marriage to Franz-Josef, her unhappiness at court, the meddling of her mother-in-law, her championing of Hungarian rights and ends with the Hungarian coronation.
""Sissi: Der Shicksalsjahre einer Kaiserin"" (The Fateful Years of an Empress) chronicles her estrangement from the Austrian court, her diagnosis with a severe lung disease, presumably tuberculosis and her moving to warmer climes; her travels to Madeira, Corfu, Athens, Milan and Venice. The third film takes the most liberties in conflating fact and fiction. All the sad parts of her life have been removed or altered. The film ends with the Imperial Family meeting the Pope at St Mark's Basilica in Venice. The final lingering shot is of the happy family waving at their loyal Italian subjects in the Piazza San Marco as the band strikes up Haydn's rousing Kaiserhymne one last time.

Each of the 3 films is presented on its own individual disc. Disc 4 contains the 139min abridged version shown in America. It is recut with scenes reordered and dubbed into English and contains a new title song ""Forever My Love"" sung in English. In doing so it omits the original Sissi theme music. It is too truncated for my liking though American viewers averse to reading subtitles and not wanting to spend 5-plus hours on the originals may find this a worthwhile substitute.

Disc 5 contains the 1954 film ""Mdchenjahre einer Knigin"" (Youthful Years of a Queen). 15-year old Romy Schneider plays Britain's newly crowned Queen Victoria. Amidst the scheming to get her married off to one or other of the royal houses of Europe, she travels to Dover and falls madly in love with a dashing young man who turns out to be the love of her life, Prince Albert of the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Like the Sissi films this is also a light-hearted romance with humour provided in the form of the 3-stooges-like ladies-in-waiting and the young Queen's bumbling old manservant. Nice costumes and sets but not on the scale of the Sissi films. And the lovely Miss Schneider is much too beautiful to be believable as the stumpy, dour-faced Queen. Still it is a nice change from the Austrian court. And after 4 films filled with the Kaiserhymne (Deutschlandslied), it's actually a pleasure to hear ""God Save The Queen"" once again. The film is in German with optional English subtitles.

Picture quality is excellent in the main Sissi Trilogy. The entire trilogy has been restored and remastered. A few scattered instances of damaged and off-colour segments can be found but they are thankfully rare. All 3 films are presented in their original 1.33:1 aspect ratio (fullscreen). Sound quality is clear 1.0 mono, although it tends to be very bright, noticeable especially when the children come screeching onto the screen. Overall, very pleasing picture and acceptable sound. Optional English subtitles are provided. The 139min American version has NOT been restored. Contrast is set pretty high, the image looks a lot brighter, washed out at times, and colours are slightly off -  Franz's blue uniform looks almost green at times. ""Mdchenjahre einer Knigin"" has similarly not been restored and suffers from the same deficiencies. Still they are watchable, about comparable to a TV broadcast of vintage 50s material. Extras are pretty limited: A trailer each for the first and last Sissi films and a vintage 18-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette for ""Die Junge Kaiserin"" on Disc 2. Romy Schneider takes us through the filming at the Schnbrunn Summer Palace, the honeymoon in the Tyrolean Alps, and Fuchsl Castle which stands in for Sisi's childhood home of Possenhofen. Three truly delightful gems from the past, beautifully restored. The price though should be a little lower.",1195862400,182,5048,5.096735187424426

2876156,5,B000RXZIJS,"[Note: This review is of the Blu-ray edition; this is also a ""verified purchase,"" but was a gift, so my name does not appear on the original Amazon order.]
I have long been fascinated with the later history of the Hapsburg monarchy, of the problematic marriage between Franz Josef and Elisabeth, and the tragedy of Mayerling. This series presents a rather whitewashed version of historical events; a friend of mine who lived in Vienna told me that Austrians think of these films less as history and more as light entertainment, sort of the way Doris Day movies are perceived by Americans. They are also the films that are credited with making Romy Schneider a star, and deservedly so. The historical Elisabeth was widely regarded as the most beautiful woman in Europe, and Schneider's radiant beauty does her full justice. So if you're willing to set aside any expectations of probing psychology and historical details, you can derive an enormous amount of pleasure from these sumptuously filmed excursions into the world of Austrian royalty. I have had the complete set first on VHS, then on DVD and now, finally, on breathtakingly restored Blu-ray. The visuals are absolutely sumptuous, with magnificent costumes and Austrian scenery, and most of the interiors were filmed in actual Viennese locations. Some of them are not the true locations--for instance, the church in which we see Sissi and Franz get married in the first film is not the Augustinerkirche where the historical event took place, but rather the nearby St. Michael's, which is surprisingly used again in the second film as the site of the royal couple's coronation in Hungary. These minor lapses aside, the clarity of the visuals and extraordinary detail make every scene a treat for the eyes, and the soundtrack is in excellent fidelity, showcasing Anton Profes's lush romantic score. Some of the music he has selected is anachronistic, featuring waltzes by Johann Strauss, Jr., that hadn't actually been composed at the time of the events portrayed, but that's neither here nor there; they wonderfully evoke the fantasy of what we would all like to think the imperial lifestyle should have been. An unexpected feature of the set is that the films can be viewed either in the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, or in 1.78:1 wide-screen. Normally I would not be a fan of such ""conversion""; obviously something is lost at the top and the bottom of the screen when you try to fill a wide screen with a movie that was not filmed in a widescreen format, but it has been so skillfully edited that you do not notice anything awry in the widescreen versions; the tops of heads are not cut off, vital visual elements are not missing, and the high-definition image makes it look as though the series was actually filmed in widescreen yesterday rather than 60 years ago. I can honestly say I have never enjoyed these films more or been more involved in the story than while watching these incredible faux widescreen adaptations. And for purists, of course, the original aspect ratio is also an option. Life in 19th=century Vienna could be dark and grim, a place where every silver lining seemed to have a cloud. But if you want to travel to the fantasy operetta Vienna in which everything is gilded opulence, whipped cream and prancing Lipizzaner horses, these delightful entertainments will take you there.",1514764800,6,3361,4.929453262786596

We also get Paramount's redubbed English compendium of the Sissi flicks - Forever My Love, looking pathetic and careworn on DVD. The extras are also idiotically produced - two truncated snippets, presumably from other documentaries we never get to see.

2876164,4,B000RXZIJS,"The Sissi Collection stars 17-year-old Romy Schneider as Princess Elisabeth (Sissi) of Austria in Sissi (1955), the film that brought her international stardom.

Sissi shows young Sissis journey with her mother to the Austrian court in Ischl, where the engagement between her sister Helene and the young emperor Franz Josef (Kark Boehm) was to be announced. But he falls for Sissi after meeting her while out fishing. Sissi is also romantically  engaged, but marriage comes with a price  Archduchess Sophie, his arrogant and headstrong mother.

In the sequel, Sissi: The Young Empress (1956), the imperial wedding takes place in Vienna and Sissi settles into everyday life as empress. The conflict between Sissi and her mother-in-law continues and is exacerbated by the birth of a daughter. Eventually, a truce is arranged and the young couple are crowned King and Queen.

Sissi: The Fateful Years of the Empress (1957) portrays Sissi as more than able not only to handle affairs of state but also her mother-in-law. As the Queen travels to Hungary in an effort to calm the insubordinate nobility, Archduchess Sophie again causes trouble for her daughter-in-law.

Victoria in Dover (1954), also included in the set, is a precursor to the Sissi films and stars Ms. Schneider as Britains Princess Victoria. On the verge of Victorias planned marriage, she leaves for Paris incognito where she meets a handsome young man and falls in love.

Ms. Schneider is not only beautiful, but manages to show aspects of Sissis personality  her anguish, loneliness, and frustrations dealing with court life. Like Marie Antoinette, Sissi is thrust into a new world and must cope with the rigors of life at court with its jealousies, resentments, and insistence on protocol. Ms. Schneider gives the young monarch humanity and vulnerability, making her sympathetic as well as fascinating.

All four films are directed by Ernst Marischka with a combination of elaborate production design, comedy, and fairytale romance. The friction between Sissi and her mother-in-law runs through the three films and offers some good moments for Vilma Degischer as Archduchess Sophie.

The unrated widescreen films are in German, with English subtitles. Bonus materials on the 5-disc set include a bonus DVD containing Forever My Love, a feature film with the condensed English-dubbed version, originally released by Paramount Pictures in the United States and featuring a theme song written by Burt Bacharach; making-of featurette; and Sissis Great-Grandson at the Movies, an except from the documentary Elisabeth: Enigma of an Empress.",1510790400,,2602,5.324390243902439

Had a delightful combination of light romance and drama with a surprising amount of comedy which made the movies for me. Austrian landscape does remind me of 'Sound of Music' as do the number of children engaged (no singing tho so clearly not a musical), costumes and locations were elegant by far, and characters were utterly engrossing from Sissi's struggles to cope with becoming a queen, to the amusing antics of the Gendarmerie-Major Bckl (reminded me some of Danny Kaye in ""The Inspector General"") as well as the coldness portrayed by Archduchess Sophie (came across as Endora's character from ""Bewitched"" only this time rancor was directed toward Sissi). Product description was true tho not as clear as it could be as to Language, subtitles were easy-to-read and to the point which was appreciated, and my wife said some scenes moved too fast of which I would agree one example such as thrill of being one-month pregnant to scene abruptly one year later with baby born and shapely figure back in form.

Where does a man's love for his wife take precedence over his duty to his entire kingdom? A noble man; a duty-bound and honorable leader, but torn between duty, tradition, and love.

2876274,3,B000RXZIJS,"The Box set includes Three Sissi films.  The first was a big succes, so they got caught up in the ""sequel"" trap.  Number 1 is very good, number 2 is ok, number 3 is Very Slow and at times boring.  The last two discs are condense versions of the first three and then Out takes.  So truly you are getting 1 good film, and two poor films, and then ""filler.""

Yes, I have visited Austria, and yes the Schonbrunn Castle and The Bavarian countryside are gorgeous and make the film beautiful.  The acting is good, and the story is ""Fairytale.""

I became interested because (I am American) and my husband is Austrian.  He talked about Sisi a lot, and how wonderful the film was, so I bought it.
I speak some German so it was fun to hear a German movie (with English subtitles).

BUT...the movie is no more true than Cinderella !

Elisabeth disliked being Empress, she disliked being in Vienna.  She spent the perponderance of her time in Hungry, and Maderia, and any other place that was NOT Vienna.  In her last decades she spent as little as a few weeks per year with her husband.  Much of this is atributed to the fact that her mother in law was domineering and disaproving.  While in the film, Franz Joseph takes the side of Sissi (one or two middle 'ss' I see it each wasy)  in life Franz Josef looked to his mother for all things relating to the Empire and the Castle.  Even Sissi's parents, who are portrayed as supportive and loving were anything but.  Even the circumstances of how they met is FALSIFIED in the movie. (there are hints of these truths in between the lines in the movie)

I find this all amusing since one of America's most loved films ""Sound of Music"" was filmed in Salzburg, Austria, and it is dismissed in Austria for it's deviation from facts.  Ah well.

Believe me, the first film is very good and very beautiful and very entertaining.....and for a film that is great.  But do not walk away thinking you know the story of The Last Emporer and Empress of Austria.  I have read a couple of books on the subject.  ""Nervous Splendor"" and ""Reluctant Empress""  The first covers the murder / suicide of Sisi's son Rudolf.  The second is a very well done biography of Sisi herself.  Both are spellbinding.  They are not from the same author, and important incidents are portrayed identically.

So, enjoy the movie for entertainment, but I recommend the books if you care at all about the fascinating True Story.",1370908800,3,2424,4.48512585812357

Nothing about the emperor's love affairs or Otto von Bismark or Sissi's death 40 years later or Rudolf's suicide 30 years later.  But still a wonderful fairy tale.

As luck would have it before that..visiting my aunt in Vienna, Austria, (1989) I was able to see the real Castle, and real painting of ""Sissi"" (Queen Elizabeth.) Yes, she actually wore the stars in her hair.
Romy Schneider (star), did an amazing job in this film, she was so very beautyful..in real life she passed away at 42, in France. She could not get over her son's fatal accident when he was 9 years old.

While the show itself can be a little corny, Romy Schneider and the rest of the cast make the corny seem magical. I was surprised at the dubbed version, Forever My Love, both by the dubbed voices and the swiftness of the storyline as it combines all three Sissi movies into one. English just doesn't do the story or the acting justice, and I was constantly annoyed by the quality of the English voices.
  Also included in this collection is the story of Vickie, which also diminishes the story of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert into a somewhat childish game of etiquette and makes the queen appear silly and focuses a bit more on gender roles.

2876370,5,B000RXZIJS,"Having studied & lived in Germany for 3 years, I was introduced to the Sissi movies, which I learned were a big comfort to Europeans after their ordeal before the 1950's. Watching what life was like in the era of monarchies & churches brought back meaningful memories of a time that was in important ways freer & more humane. Plus, these movies were something different from the same stream of Cowboy-Western movies that were so big in the 1950's.
  But the Sissi movies are phenomenal. For some reason before the 1990's (except for the British), German & European movies in general never compared to the quality of Hollywood, usually making no sense. The plots were weird, the acting was strange, the scripts were subjectively symbolic, the scenes were psychological, etc. The Sissi movies prove that the Germans & Austrians, and any European film company, could produce top quality movies that felt just like they came from Hollywood. The story, the acting, the scripts, the scenes, everything about the Sissi movies are comparable to a Hollywood movie. All of them are quite delightful & historically-culturally informative. Why didn't the Europeans do more of this?
  I highly recommend these movies, in spite of the Bavarian & Austrian dialects. They are a lot of fun to watch for the whole family. Plus, teachers can use them to start good discussions on culture, certain social issues, history, etc. from a German-Austrian perspective.",1340236800,,1442,5.046218487394958

2876422,5,B000RXZIJS,"Few people in America know about the Sissi movies, which in their own native Germany are somewhat akin to the Sound of Music or the Christams specials that play every year.  These are high-budget technicolor films, produced in the golden age of filmmaking.  Expect to see crowds of thousands, aristocratic balls, sweeping mountain veiws, steamboats, warships, horses, carriages, weddings, parades, organs choirs... Ah sweet God!  How else can I describe this candy-box of a movie?

The film takes as its subject Empress Elizabeth of Austria, once known affectionately by her people as ""Sissi.""  The real, historical Sissi is for the German world somewhat like what Queen Victoria is for the English world.  The film presents an accurate (if family-friendly) version of events.  I say family friendly because although Elizabeth probably had affairs it is not known for certain, and the films decide she was faithful to her husband.  By no means are these idealized films!  There are painful moments in the Sissi trilogy, as well as the ever present threat of assasination.  There is one moment in particular that I think of, when Sissi and her sister have just finished dancing with the emperor at the ball.  The emperor is supposed to marry Sissi's sister, and the sign will be that he presents her with a bouquet of flowers.  When the time comes the Emperor goes towards her, but Sissi recieves the flowers.  The camera focuses in not on Sissi at the moment of triumpth but her sister, who is of course visably devasted.  A moment later when Sissi is alone with the emperor she asks, ""Why have you forced this fait-accompli on me?""

More than any other film I have written about, I feel the need to defend this one.  To depict good is not to depict some idealized imagination; good is a very real thing.  The people in these films are good, and that doesn't stop them from feeling pain like the rest of us.  One of the masteries of these films is in fact the absence of a villan.  They show us how extrodinarily good people can still hurt each other, often exactly because they try to be good.  I really feel that this is what film should be, perhaps not what all film must be, but certainly what most film is when it attains to its highest potential.  And did I mention its in glourious technicolor?",1301875200,,2301,4.7025

I love the movie so much that I had to purchase this for myself. The movie is wonderful but again only 2 of the movies was spoken in the English language while trying to follow the subtitles spoken in foreign language was difficult to enjoy. I found myself rewinding just so I can re-read the subtitles to understand what just had happened. I would recommend the movie to my friends and family but I will warn them that only 2 of this trilogy is spoken in the English language. Overall I do like this trilogy and it is a great value for the price but once again understand that you are purchasing a trilogy set that is spoken majority in German then English.

2876467,5,B000RXZIJS,"This German film trilogy is delightful and entertaining on several levels.  While it has a decidedly light feel, particularly to this current generation accustomed to ponderous and hypercritical treatments of the past, the films also deal with important human themes beneath the sparkle and charm of the beautiful scenery, charming actors and actresses, its sentimentality and the frequent comic relief.  It is a refreshing change to view a film that is immensely entertaining in its combination of history, romance and humor, yet still manages to depict issues of universal relevance and import such as tensions between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the conflict between individual dreams and family harmony, the clash of differing family cultures as well as temptations to adultery.  The film also presents the political tensions within the Hapsburg Empire as well as the burdensome, stressful life of the ruling Hapsburg family that ""Sissi"" married into.

Romy Schneider is lovely as the main character Elisabeth of Bavaria, affectionately known as ""Sissi,"" and the other characters are splendidly played as well.  Critics may argue that a film with such a light tone is far from realistic in its handling of the historical period depicted.  There is unarguably some truth to such a criticism, as this is no documentary-style drama.  However, if we are just in our examination of historical films, the very serious works that focus on everything grim and sordid in the past, usually viewed through a modern perspective completely alien to the time period presented, are probably as far removed the historical reality as the sentimental and idealized ""Sissi.""  I believe that we would all benefit from more films like ""Sissi""--sparkling entertainments that still provide a few good insights about human nature and history amidst the laughter and optimism.

""Sissi"" is also of particular interest to German speakers and those interested in German cinema.",1243209600,4,1960,5.4

The main films have been beautifully restored and show Austria at it's peak through a romantic lens as the films examine the courting, marriage and life of Sissi, Empress of Austria.  In addition to lovely and colorful shots of Austrian palaces and countryside, this is a nostalgic and fond remembrance of a gilded empire seen through from the personal perspective of the most popular royal woman in the history of the Habsburgs.  The difficulties are glossed over, but you're not buying history here.  This is a sympathetic postcard from the Ancien Regime.",1220572800,,634,4.952830188679245

2876505,5,B000RXZIJS,"This is a beautiful costume drama starring the stunning young Romy Schneider in a historical setting of the creation of the Austria-Hungary empire and, additionally, portraying the young Queen Victoria and her beloved Prince Albert.  All but this latter story are in German with English subtitles, which is distracting but tolerable.  The Victoria story is dubbed in English.  The acting is 1960's vintage, but still enjoyable to watch.",1205193600,,436,5.382352941176471

Wathching these movies not only helped in building my language skills, but also gave me a true love of the beauty of Bavaria and Austria and a true sense of the pride the inhabitants have in their regions.  I wish we had more access to ""original language"" films from the earlier days of filmmaking and less of the junk we Americans manage to produce today.",1205107200,5,495,4.613636363636363

8202998,5,B000RXZIJS,"In fulfillment of the persistent pleas of a viewer, Turner Classic Movies graced its airspace with the three films directed by Ernst Marischka romanticizing the life of Austria's last Empress, Elisabeth, affectionately known as Sissi, in these paradigms of the Heimatfilms(Home films) that were popular with audiences in postwar Germany and Austria. For many years, the airing of these films on television was a Christmastime tradition in several European countries.  Amid  an expressive score by Anton Proved,this endearing saga of a remarkable, tumultuous,(and sadly, ill-fated) life begins.  We observe the home life of Sissi's family at Possenhoven Castle on the shores of Bavaria's Lake Starnberg. Duke Maximilian Josef(Gustav Knuth), and Princess Ludovika(Magda Schneider) preside over a merry brood of eight children , the eldest daughter of whom is called Helena, and affectionately known as Nene( Uta Franz).  Our first sight of 16-year-old Sissi(Magda Schneider's daughter, Romy in her star-turning role,and proving herself to be a fine actress even at a tender age),jumping fences on horseback to her father's amusement and admiration. But we also see how awkward, girlish, and impulsive the  young beauty is.  Still, the girl accompanies her mother and older sister to the north Austrian town of Bad Ischl where Ludovika and her sister,the Austrian Archduchess Sophie (Vilma Degischer) hope to arrange a match between Nene and her son, Emperor Franz Josef(a cleanly handsome Karlheinz Bohm).But an accidental meeting between the Emperor and young Sissi changes the course of history.  After the initial encounter, Franz Josef says he envies the man who will marry Sissi,and ultimately decides to be that man. Before the Kaiser's birthday gala, in which he will announce his choice of bride, Sissi expresses her apprehension because she does not wish to betray her sister. Sophie believes the calmer and more pious Nene would be a better Kaiserin for Austria.  But the young Kaiser prevails, and amid beautiful and stately scenes that complement the loving nature of the stunned and reluctant Sissi, we view the reconciliation of the sisters after Nene, who left home for a while, returns with a new suitor, Prince Maximilian Anton von Thurn under Taxis. After Sissi greets her new subjects warmly on a steamboat ride down the Danube to Vienna, she and the Kaiser marry in a beautiful and solemn wedding mass.  The second film, an entry in the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, Sissi, the Young Empress, finds our restless young heroine struggling to adapt to her new life,and dealing with her difficult mother-in-law,who lays claim to Sissi's first child,Archduchess Sophie, after naming the infant for herself. The Emperor's mother feels the teenager too young and inept to raise the child, and that Sissi belongs with her husband on his tour of the Empire. A potential scandal occurs when Sissi returns to her family home in Bavaria, although she initially hides the reason for her return from her mother. The young Kaiser follows her and convinces her to return, and her influence with her husband strengthens.  Together, the Imperial couple tour Hungary,and Sissi supports the cause of equal representation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire advocated by Count Gyula Andrassy(Walther Reyer).In an event tha actually took place a decade later,we see Sissi crowned Queen of Hungary.  The final film, entered in the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, is the 1957 release, Sissi-The Fateful Years of an Empress. Here, we find a slightly more mature Sissi enjoying her visit to Hungary, and while cherishing the political alliance with Count Andrassy, she responds to his confession of love for her by returning to Vienna (although history suggests otherwise). Back home, the Kaiser remains in his office while his mother still limits Sissi's access to her daughter.  After the Imperial couple meet halfway between Austria and Hungary, they vacation at Bad Ischl. But Sissi contracts tuberculosis, managing to comfort her heartbroken husband before being sent to the warm  climate areas of Madeira and Corfu where her mother joins her and helps nurse her. Archduchess Sophie, in the meantime, now has a legitimate excuse for keeping Sissi's daughter out of her grasp, which threatens her will to recover.  Following the optimistic pattern of glad reunions with her husband,the couple reunite in Italy after Sissi recovers. They deal with a less-than-amiable reception in Austria's remaining possesions in northern Italy,Milan and Venice.  At the opera house of La Scala, the Italian nobles send only their servants dressed in formal attire to greet the couple as an insult. But another glad family reunion will melt and win Italian hearts.  Josef Meinrad plays Major Bockl,Hans Zuglr plays Dr. Seeburger,Sonia Sorel is Henriette Mendel, Klaus Knuth appears as Prince Ludwig, Albert Ruprecht plays Archduke Ferdinand Max,Walter Regelsberger plays Count Windish-Graetz,  and Erich Nikowitz played Kaiser Franz Karl.  A 1962 composite film, Sissi-Forever My Love,with English dubbing and a theme song performed by Jane Morgan was released in the United States, further enhancing the myth of this beautiful, enigmatic, complicated, but charitable woman.  Those unfamiliar with Sissi's story can defer the unhappy actualities for another time, and just savor the beauty of this sentimental confection of a trilogy paying tribute to a star-crossed beauty who innocently and unintentionally won the heart and hand of an Emperor over a century ago.",1527033600,,5532,5.359861591695502

8203000,5,B000RXZIJS,"OMG what a restoration from the original DVD's! AGFA color never looked this good. Bruno Mondi (who filmed a lot of movies in the Nazi period) shot spectacular scenery...almost a fairyland story. You will never get tired of these movies. Sound is outstanding too. What is so interesting is Germans (or Austrians) were still filming in 4 X 3 frame while Hollywood had really gone to widescreen by this time. On these disks there has been a ""re-framing"" of the original to make them appear widescreen - and really not a bad effort. I am way too much a purist and want to see everything that was filmed and keep it in 4 X 3 (you have a choice). Films are virtually perfect - clear, clean, no scratches and very very sharp and colorful. Subtitles are excellent.",1524096000,,757,4.532846715328467

Now, the actual story of Sissi, empress of Austria, is not a glamorous as the movies show, so if you're looking for a correct life documentary on Sissi, this is not for you. If you want a spin off and are looking for a romantic story without indecency that still has some solid historic facts in it, this is for you. Romy Schneider plays a lovely Elisabeth aka Sissi. The movies are clean, modest, innocent. There are family issues that have to be resolved, life to be dealt with, and lots of love to be shared.",1519430400,,673,4.224806201550388
