4667000,3,B005ER6SWS,"First I'd like to say that the concert part is great! BUT, the extra features on the disc, photo gallery and 2 bonus videos DO NOT WORK! I had to return the first Blu-ray back to Amazon to get a new one and the second one sent out had the same problem. I placed these Blu-rays in two different Blu-ray players and the same problem, so their is a problem in the making of this disc.  So, If you JUST want the concert, GREAT. But the extra content, forget it!",1327449600,3,457,4.0777777777777775
4667001,4,B005ER6SWS,"Firstly I think that Europe are a great, great band.  Unfortunately however the main feature of this DVD a show filmed at London's Shepherds Bush is truly AWFUL - poorly shot and poorly edited. A lot of hand held cameras bouncing all over the place focussed on the bass player during guitar solos etc.  Nothing wrong with the performance of the band at all - that is first rate. It just appears that they have chosen a production company that was out of it's league.

I was extremely disappointed with this purchase until I watched the bonus material.  There are around six songs or so pro-filmed outdoor at what appears to be a Stockholm theme park which is VERY, VERY GOOD (great pyro!) followed by eight songs pro-filmed (and I do mean 'pro-filmed') indoors at a Stockholm ice rink which is EXCEPTIONAL.  Why could this concert not have been the main feature as it is as good as ANY pro shot footage out there of ANY arena/ stadium rock band.  The DVD is worth buying for the ice rink (partial) concert alone. I just wished there could have been more of this. Great band that continues to make great music.  Looking forward to Europe's next cd as Last Look at Eden was fantastic - a truly rocking cd.  Def Leppard take note - stick to your guns and release a rocking cd!!!",1324512000,7,1275,4.4655172413793105
8468863,5,B005ER6SWS,Excellent set list supporting the Last Look At Eden tour.  Great quality video and audit - all shows.,1529193600,,101,4.611111111111111
8468864,5,B005ER6SWS,"Excellent! One of their best DVD's. All original members, all the hits and some good new stuff. A must!",1510704000,,103,4.473684210526316
8468865,5,B005ER6SWS,"I have the DVD set and this is truly value for money. The main concert is terrific and the Gary Moore Tribute (John Norum plays The Loner) worth the price alone for me.  The bonus concert footage of another hour and a half is spectacular. Unlike some of the other reviewers I do not have any issues with the main concert which is an hour and a half and I find the band very energetic, Norum's guitar playing wonderful and in whole a brilliant show.

 NOW the rub... on the DVD you can view two very cool music videos and backstage film... this is NOT accessible on the BR disc due to incorrect encoding at manufacture.... so its still a great disc but USA viewers will not enjoy a few of the bonus features. I emailed the manufacturer to check on this and they are aware of the problem , but likely due to the overall lack of interest in this group over here, are making no corrections. Even though the disc does not deliver all that is promised at over two hours I rate this a five star purchase, for content and price.",1386633600,,1020,4.247422680412371
8468866,5,B005ER6SWS,Awesome photo book with a DVD and music CD. Plays on a newer DVD and on my computer! The extras are awesome!,1375228800,,108,3.9545454545454546
8468867,5,B005ER6SWS,"This blu ray has very good content. Not only the concert itself but other concerts, footage and pics. It is great!",1367452800,,114,4.476190476190476
8468868,5,B005ER6SWS,"Happy with my purchase but all BONUS features on this Blu-ray cannot be read.
I tried the disc on 2 different Blu-ray machine and nothing happened.",1345075200,2,147,4.6923076923076925
8468869,4,B005ER6SWS,"I was completely imprssed from the video to the sound mix...Joey still has the voice, and I enjoyed the new songs...recommended buy!",1337731200,,132,5.045454545454546
8468870,2,B005ER6SWS,"This could have been a GREAT DVD. Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, it's poorly shot and very poorly edited. The shot never last longer than 2 seconds and is often zooming very quickly! During guitar solos, the video should show the guitarist. As to the bands performance and sound, all is good!

EDIT: All is not good. I found that I couldn't watch this dvd anymore. Too many scene cuts and not very interesting from a visual perspective. Funny thing is that the concert on the bonus is filmed much better, too bad it's incomplete. Ended up selling....",1330128000,,562,4.6767676767676765
8468871,4,B005ER6SWS,"This is a great concert and you get three performances in one! I like the fast editing and different angles with close up cameras it feels sometimes you're up there with the band on stage, cool. I really like the show and sound, the clear picture on the Blu-ray (european version) & the bonus CD is a killer when driving my car. Yeah ! The Bonus show from outdoor with a lot of pyro is cool and the feature from ice hockey arena is amazing. Brilliant! Play loud.",1329350400,,462,4.261363636363637
