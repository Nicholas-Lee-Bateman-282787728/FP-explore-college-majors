8242504,1,B0011UXVWW,For adoption this was required to read or watch. It was a horror show. If we did this to our kids we should be locked up. It may help with bonding but watching it was weird.,1388620800,,173,3.8333333333333335

8242506,5,B0011UXVWW,"I bought this DVD because I started an Attachment Parenting parent support group in my area, and I was planning on doing our next meeting on infant massage.  I also bought several other infant massage materials.

This DVD is fantastic!  It shows how to give a massage, and they show it both on a doll and on real babies, so you kind of see how they squirm, and what to expect.  They are also realistic about infant massage--sometimes you may have 30 minutes, and other times you may have just 3 minutes!  The narrator also mentions that since we're working with babies, sometimes there are ""fountains"" (the babies sometimes pee because they are relaxed), and ""music"" (crying).  It's all very down-to-earth.

The DVD seems really professionally done; there are words on the screen sometimes to enhance the presentation.

It turns out I've found a professional massage therapist to lead our next support group meeting, so I won't be using the information from this DVD to teach other parents, but I'm still glad I bought it, and we will keep using it.

Oh, also, there is a pretty good preview (trailer?) for this DVD on YouTube, so if you want a good sense of what this DVD is like, look up babybabyohbaby on YouTube, and you can see some little pieces from it.",1355356800,,1260,4.63963963963964
8242507,5,B0011UXVWW,"Video is very well made. Video shows the massage on a doll as well as on a real baby so you can see that a baby may not lie still (especially at first), but that doesn't mean they don't like it. There is an emphasis on reading your baby's cues to see if what you are doing is ok and shows a baby who has has enough and one that doesn't like a particular massage. It also emphasizes that it may be difficult at first and you may only do one massage, but as you both get used to it, it will get better.",1299196800,2,500,3.8173076923076925
8242508,5,B0011UXVWW,"This video is easy to watch, interesting & features 'real' moms, dads & babies. It clearly demonstrates that baby massage is easy, fun, & has many, many wonderful benefits. As an Infant Massage Instructor, I highly recommend this gentle & very well produced DVD.",1226793600,6,262,4.9772727272727275
