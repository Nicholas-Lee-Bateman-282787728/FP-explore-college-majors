8642183,4,B00II5XGB4,"Remember that scene near the end of Ratatouille which talks about the relationship between the critic and the actual process of creating something worth criticizing? This film is very heavily centered around those same themes as a Korean teenager at a film school learns how much more difficult it is to actual create a film than it is to simply critique it.

It's a shame this movie will go largely unnoticed in America, it's a must-watch for anyone interested in the art of film.",1406505600,3,481,4.726190476190476
8642184,5,B00II5XGB4,This brought back so many memories of film school. Zombie actors eating blood sausages for lunch. I laughed at them and with them. Helped me learn some more useful Korean (curse words) too. Highly recommend to anyone who loves movies and movie-making. Bought a second copy to send to my friend.,1404691200,2,294,4.784313725490196
