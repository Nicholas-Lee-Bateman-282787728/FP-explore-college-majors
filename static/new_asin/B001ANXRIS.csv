Filmed two years before they would work together in the 20 hour TV series, Bjarne Henriksen and Nicolaj Kopernikus appear as workmates Henrik and Ren in blue overalls (must have been practice for The Killing's red overalls) who are part of a lottery syndicate. In charge of arranging the weekly gamble is Jrgen (Sren Pilmark Aftermath) When submitting monies for the syndicate's lucky dip lines, Jrgen also enters lucky dip lines for his wife Gitte (Ditte Grbl). One Saturday it the syndicate's ticket is the winner of 3.6 million kroner (more than $600,000). What the syndicate doesn't know won't harm them assumes Jrgen so decides that it was his wife's ticket which won.
From this point on we see the amusing and devious ways in which Jrgen attempts to carry on just as normal whilst hiding the fact of the win. When one of the group becomes aware of the deception, he decides to become a regular visitor to Jrgen for payments to keep his silence, even though most of it is spent by his wife Lone (Sofie Stougaard - star of DR's Nikolaj og Julie TV series). Will Jrgen's ever epanding lies ever be uncovered?
Lotto is entirely in Danish with English subtitles. There are some outtakes, deleted scenes and a behind the scenes clip on the DVD. Sadly none of these extras contain English subtitles, however the outtakes are amusing to watch.
Sren Pilmark is the main star of this and he carries off the role of Jrgen very well with some fine acting from Ditte Grbl.
Nicolaj and Bjarne can also be seen in the 1997 comedy Let's Get Lost in which they star with Sidse Babett Knudsen. Bjarne's most recent work is as a cabinet minister in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Government-Season-1-Ep-1-10/dp/B004Z32E0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Government: Season 1 (Ep. 1-10)</a>.
If you've seen any other Danish film or TV, you probably know the high standards of acting featured. This is no different.
