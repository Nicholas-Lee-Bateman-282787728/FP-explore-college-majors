8090890,5,B000BPZ9U0,"""The Physical Body: Indian Wrestling & Physical Culture"", is the first in a series by filmmaker Vincent Giordano. Viewers are introduces Kushti, the ancient art of Indian wrestling, usually held in an earthen pit. Fast-paced matches, traditional Indian exercises, & a glimpse of life inside the Akhara (training gym) are all covered in this excellent documentary.

Gadas (maces), joris (heavy clubs), mudgals (Indian clubs), nals (stone weights), gar nals, (stone wheels), and sumtolas (wooden barbells) are explored. The section on the Mallakhamb (the wrestler's pole) & the rope version of the Mallakhamb defy gravity; this alone is worth the price of the DVD. There is little information and even less footage of these ancient training devices. Vincent's keen eye and expert cinematography brings them to life.

Popular body weight exercises such as dands (jack knife push-ups) and baithaks (deep knee bends are shown in different variations. The Hindu Squat Thrust, which combines dands with baithaks, is introduced. These exercises and their relationship to the popular Sun Salutation are examined. An acrobatic neck bridging series is demonstrated, along with a rigorous warm up.

Once again Vincent Giordano takes viewer on a journey inside an exotic, unfamiliar training environment. The sequel to ""The Physical Body"", ""The Physical Body 2: Competition Training and the Dangal"", was just released.  PB2 goes even further and focuses on training routines used to prepare for Dangals (wrestling competitions). Both DVDs are a must for grapplers, conditioning junkies, and historians alike.

8090891,5,B000BPZ9U0,"This is truly a rare peek at the ""root"" of one of the most formidable practice of hand 2 hand fighting. The dvd went through the many variations of exercises never before seen in live action footage and it will expound on any current knowledge you might think you have on wrestling and its counterpart - conditioning. For the novice and the experts, it delivers detailed explainations and concepts on a variety of movement exercises and ancient training tools. For fighters and for fitness enthusiasts, this is one I would NOT miss!",1186876800,,532,4.793478260869565
8090892,5,B000BPZ9U0,"As a long time combat sports researcher and author I found this DVD to be excellent. Well researched and well done, it goes a long way in helping to preserve the oft overlooked wrestling heritage of India.
While my primary focus is North America and catch-as-catch-can wrestling I thoroughly enjoyed this journey to the land that is likely the cradle of much of the grappling arts.
Gama the Great would be proud.
Keep up the good work Vincent.

8090893,5,B000BPZ9U0,"Strong DVD for insight to traditional Indian wrestling training methodology. It showed different strength training methods (clubs, poles) that I'd never seen. The photography was well done with training sequences done for the camera as they would train.  The documentary feel allowed me to appreciate their training process.  As a practioner of yoga, it was nice to see wrestlers practicing Yoga with a military intent instead of the sport club and holistically minded environment. It was nice to see it in reference to a more warrior mindset... Can't wait for future DVD's like this.",1186704000,2,584,5.202127659574468
8090894,5,B000BPZ9U0,"I will just say simply if I could have given this more stars I would have. This DVD covers two topics I love .Wrestling and rare ancient forms of exercise. I have been involved in Martial arts for over forty years . I presently teach club swinging and can say there is nothing on the market that deals with these topics as this DVD does. The author did a splendid job capturing for the first time on film the almost lost exercise arts of India. Yoga has been done to death but it seems no one has captured these other ancient forms of exercise before. I personaly visited the Library of Congress in Washingtom DC over one hundred times while researching ancient forms of  wrestling . I looked up over four hundred old or vintage books . I also cornered the curator of the Asian Studies area of the library and had him help me search for all books in print or movies on India and its wrestling .Many books only exist on Microfilm.  Trust me nothing like this DVD exists.
  After seeing the film I came to discover the Filmaker and author did this documentary on his own dime and after many trips to India. The information captured is priceless to some one like myself. It allowed me to see for the first time the actual practices I had up till viewing this DVD had only read about.  There is one old book that realy encompasses the the traditional styles of exercise in India. It is the Encyclopidia of Indian Physical Culture written in India in 1950. This DVD is a great companion to that old book. The footage of the Mallakhamb is worth the price alone.  If you are looking for an instructional this is not for you . If however you are looking to see actual people of India doing Dands(push ups), Baithaks (Hindu Squats),Heavy Jori (clubs) swinging,Gada(Mace), Mallakhamb (pole /Vine)and tradition wrestling practice this DVD is a must have.
  I look forward to other materials produced by this Author. He definately delivered.",1186617600,2,1929,4.554913294797688
8090895,5,B000BPZ9U0,"I loved this video. You can tell that this was done on location and contained interviews of authentic practioners. It does not have the ""staged"" feeling we find in too many alleged documentaries that are presented on televsion and  in film. I appreciated the work done by this author. You can tell that he knows his subject and that it was well researched.  He gives us a great view into this rarely seen subject. I highly recommend this video to all martial art, history, and physical training enthusiasts. I look forward to the next video in the series.",1186617600,,555,4.653061224489796
8090896,2,B000BPZ9U0,"I regret buying this disc.  The documentary doesn't tell much about the inception or historic development of kushti.  While actual matches are included in this film, they are edited down into mere highlight reels.  Furthermore, what is shown makes kushti seem like an unimpressive combination of Greco-Roman & Freestyle Wrestling mixed with some Judo and Hapkido.  As a form of wrestling, kushti seems more like the result of outside influences than anything ""indigenous"" to India.  The excercise regiments documented in the film are little more than Russian Kettlebell style training, and anyone who's ever wrestled will immediately recognize the ""sit-ups, squats, and push-ups"" as anything but the ""uniquely Indian"" product this film claims them to be.  This documentary would've been better served if it had focused more on the passing of kushti from father to son, the status of women in kushti, the national pride India once took in this soon-to-be-defunct sport, and the reasons for the sport's demise -something more anthropologically compelling than the poorly researched sketch that is this documentary.",1185408000,3,1112,5.436046511627907
