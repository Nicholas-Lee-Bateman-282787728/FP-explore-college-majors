8573502,1,B00BT5EPJW,"This Blu-Ray DVD should have never been made! Lackluster performance with horrible singing, especially from Paul Stanley! Paul sounds like he probably has a bad flu and you can see him physically struggling to sing in key! He very rarely hits the right notes! Just a horrible performance from the whole band! Eric singer, the drummer, acts bored through the whole ordeal! Gene is probably the most into the performance, but even he sounds strange and like he's struggling to sing the way he used to back in the day! Besides that, this disc usually is selling for $30.00 or more! Don't spend your hard earned money on this crap! You will absolutely be majorly disappointed like me!",1388102400,2,680,4.771186440677966
