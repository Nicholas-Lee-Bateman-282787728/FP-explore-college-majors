8680685,4,B00NW6KPCM,"Amagai ss plus is a sequel to Amagai ss, so please remember that. If you're familiar with anime youve heard of ovas, well Amagai ss plus is in many ways a long ova. Story wise we see our main man back with his girls, though again unlike harem animes this isn't a true one. As the original, our guy has a few episodes of what ifs, like what if he ended up with this girl or that one, etc. That being said this is just the same concept but adding upon the original series. All the girls get a few episodes beyond the original series and it's cool to see some extra content with them. That however is why this show only gets 4 stars, it's a series that really isn't needed and it only acts as more when it's not 100% needed. Animation wise and sound remain the same in terms of the original. Overall if you were a big fan of Amagai plus then I will recommend this, but if you weren't a huge fan or liked how the series ended each tale then this isn't for you. Personally I never mind an add on of content in games and in many ways this is like that.",1434240000,,1046,4.009569377990431
