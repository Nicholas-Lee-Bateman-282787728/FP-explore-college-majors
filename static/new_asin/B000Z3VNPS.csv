And it's like a couple of you tube videos burned on to a DVD ... he uses a lot of agave, miso [raw? well in his eyes]. Great tasting raw sweet potatoes - really? Whatever ... wish I didn't buy .... afraid 2c how much I really paid for it ... but thank goodness it was used.

If he plugs his book one more time and tell to sell you on the idea of a Blentec (?) Blender - you actually want to scream.",1470614400,,467,3.814432989690722

8234705,1,B000Z3VNPS,"The gentleman that narrates and demonstrates the dishes is a terrible speaker.  He mumbles, repeats the same things over and over, and does this nervous, insecure giggle thing throughout the dvd.  All the dishes are made from the same few ingredients, and the presentation is weak and mediocre at best.  The actual recipes are NOT included.  If you want those you'll have to buy the book, which Bryan indicates in the dvd again and again.  Raw food is much more diverse and wonderful than this dvd shows.  This might be okay for a total beginner, but I wouldn't even recommend it for that.  You can learn more from various, free youtube videos and make better recipes.  My husband and I were both highly disappointed in this dvd.",1355184000,2,729,4.68503937007874
8234706,4,B000Z3VNPS,"I thought this was fun, quick, easy and accessible.  We are new to raw food uncooking and we didn't want to be overwhelmed.  While there are a lot of cheesy self-promotions (but not commercials), I felt the recipes were manageable and we've already tried a few.  I do wish Brian would put up a list of ingredients for all recipes.  He does for some of them, however  for others it is sort of a ""drizzle"" of this, and ""some"" of that.  I realize that you need to get the ""feel"" for it, but I do wish that his written recipes before/after showing how to make them were consistent...he has the recipes for some of them.  I get the feeling this was meant to be a companion for his book.  That being said, it's easy enough to just try one recipe, get the few ingredients needed and actually have prepared a raw meal!  This was a great accomplishment for us, and this video made it easy!  He does use a lot of nuts, which my body does not like to be overloaded by.  We did the mac and cheese, which was good for a side dish, but a little overwhelming as a whole meal.  I thought it tasted good and looked good, but after a while, I had that uggh feeling, that I ate too much of it.  The cheese sauce is so amazing I was truly surprised, but I think it would be better on the tacos and other such things rather than the main part of the dish.  We also made the broccoli soup, which was refreshing and tasty.  The key for me to remember as I begin to transition to raw foods, is that less food is enough food, otherwise I may overwhelm my system... especially if there are nuts in the recipe.  Another good thing, is you don't need a dehydrator for this DVD and each recipe only asks for a few ingredients.",1268956800,4,1697,4.159509202453988
