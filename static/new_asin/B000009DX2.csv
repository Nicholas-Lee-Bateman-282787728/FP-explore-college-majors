7905439,5,B000009DX2,"If you are a HK cinema fan who's never seen this film, then you need to order this one right away! Violent, fast-paced and a high bodycount make this one of the greatest ""GWG"" I have ever seen, and I've seen just about all of them.
With an all-star cast that includes: Moon Lee, Yukari Oshima and Sibelle Hu -- I can't think of a reason why anyone wouldn't want to see this. ANGEL TERMINATORS 2 has some great fight scenes you don't want to miss.
Plot: When teens (Moon & Yukari) help a friend who's been forced into prostitution they upset some very dangerous people. With the help of a renegade cop (Sibelle Hu), a bloody war ensues with tragic consequences.
Order this today. You won't be disappointed",974332800,2,704,4.465116279069767
