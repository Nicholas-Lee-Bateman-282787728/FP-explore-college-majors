4901834,4,B005X7H9U4,"I enjoyed this Bluray DVD it was different from some others I own.  It took more time explaining animals, caves, and land development than others did which were purely scenic with some historic facts mentioned.  The price is right and their are still beautiful scenic shots too.  Well worth the $4/99 I paid.",1335657600,4,308,4.773584905660377
4901835,2,B005X7H9U4,"I was looking for an interesting program about things to do in the Black Hills and Badlands.  While there was some beautiful footage, it did not entice you to vacation there.  It barely touched on things to do in the area.  They focused on the fossils found there and the different types of animals that USED to roam.  That has nothing to do with what's going on there now.  Way too much history on Wild Bill Hickock.  Nothing about what you can do in Deadwood now.  And of course, way too much Native American religious beliefs.  I'm not being intolerant.  It was just not relevant to your typical National Park exlporation video.  I couldn't wait for it to end.",1335484800,4,663,4.495798319327731
4901836,1,B005X7H9U4,"I know this is like $5 but I expected a decent movie.  Very poor film (there's even footage where you can see sensor dust spots that were not removed) not appropriate for Blu-ray, erratic editing, not a very good narrative, I definitely do not recommend this movie.  This is elementary level movie in any case, maybe kids would like it.  This could have been much, much better.",1334361600,6,377,4.597014925373134
4901837,1,B005X7H9U4,"I have many volumes of the BBC Earth and BBC Video collections about wildlife and nature and all that beauty of our natural earth.  But this collection bored me beyond tears.  This is one of those videos that your teacher made you watch so that she could go have a cigarette in the lobby while you watched this lame film.  As a student, this film could make you groggy and drowsy for the rest of your school day, so student beware! If I had to watch this in a nature class, I'd've asked to dropped the class and apply my interests towards something else for a school credit.

The narrator, has this annoying forced expectation of himself to enunciate every syllable very clearly, so he just sounded grating as hell as he narrated, which felt as comfortable as hearing someone drag their fingernails across a chalkboard.

And what's next, I don't usually like to criticize someone's effort at putting out poor video quality, but this Blu-Ray disc which is said to be of ""stunning high definition"" couldn't have stated a greater farce in what happens to be true.  I have DVD's that look sharper and clearer (and more ""stunning"", so to speak) than this lousy Blu-Ray disc.  But again, it could also be that my eyes were watering as I was yawning throughout the film, so perhaps my vision was compromised by the tears in my eyes.  No, that may not be true.  It had poor definition right from the start, many moments before I started being bored to death.

But anyway, I only paid five bucks for this Blu-Ray disc.  I really doubt that I'll ever watch this again.  In fact, I'm gonna trade it in somewhere towards another decent used Blu-Ray disc.  If they give me a dollar in credit for the trade in, I'll believe that it's worth it.  I'll accept the 4 dollar loss.  If anyone pays more than 2 dollars for this BD as used, he or she may feel that they just got ripped off. Insomniacs may actually enjoy getting something beneficial and helpful using this BD as a potent sleep inducing tool. So, there ya go!",1334188800,4,2003,4.479338842975206

4901840,4,B005X7H9U4,"It has been about thirty years since I visited this region & my only memories are the few photos I can still find. I thought that for the then asking-price of $6, I'd give this video a shot.

It's a very basic package. No liner notes; the disc is divided into just four chapters with no extra features. They are: 1) The Beauty 2) Geology 3) Ecosystems 4) History and Parks. My machine times the program at 69 rather than the 75 minutes listed in the description.

There is some stunning videography here, particularly in the Badlands. Dialogue is mostly narration by a male, with quiet background music, as well as a few comments by a local resident and park rangers. I found all chapters interesting.

Just a few personal nitpicks caused me to deduct one star... I thought too much time was devoted to a section showing fossils collected in the area, as well as to the shooting death of Wild Bill Hickok. Wind Cave National Park in the Black Hills is barely mentioned; however there is a good section covering neighboring Jewel Cave National Monument. I would have liked to have seen information about hiking and other outdoor opportunities, but that information is easily available elsewhere. This is definitely a natural and human history program, not a travelogue.

For the price, I consider this a good bargain. Very satisfied!",1326844800,49,1332,4.753246753246753

4901871,3,B005X7H9U4,"This hour-long video is informative in many ways. If you're planning a trip or simply interested, you can't go too far wrong for $6.99. But sadly, the videography, the script, and especially the narration are all sub-par.

The beautiful striated canyons of the Badlands are pale and washed out. The script bounces from place to place incoherently. There are long presentations by various professors, researchers, and park rangers, all of whom are well-informed, and none of whom are well served by the stare-into-a-stationary-camera-and-talk approach.

Now for the narration. Alphonse Keasley, if you're reading your reviews, listen up. Narration is story-telling. That's why professional actors are generally so good at it. It should not be an exercise in clarity of pronunciation. Nobody wants to hear how distinctly you can speak every ""T"" for an hour. It's beyond grating. Do you hear any actor do that, ever? Take some acting lessons and give a little thought to your craft before you subject another audience to this.

The film was produced by an outfit called Centre Communications. Two guys, between them, are credited as producer, director, writer, editor, and cameraman. All in all, an amateurish effort.",1380326400,,1214,5.27979274611399
4901872,3,B005X7H9U4,"While hearing about the Black Hills and being intrigued to plan a visit, I bought this inexpensive dvd and gave it a test drive.

Pros:
Decent story telling, nice variety of information (including really cool interview with Park ranger describing Fossil skulls found there!)
Decent to fairly beautiful visuals of the black hills topography

Cons:
While I got the Blu-ray version, this was shot in 2005 (?) so nothing really impressive. Most shots of the Black Hills were filmed on overcast days, with repeat footage in various parts of the doc. Even though they did give descriptions of how they were formed, the visual footage to compliment that description wasn't even complimentary. Lots of shots had no panning and were really boring after awhile.

Overall, worth the price for a quick intro, but definitely not as insightful as hoped for from a National Park series.",1368921600,2,871,4.993103448275862
4901873,4,B005X7H9U4,"History,  landscape, geology, peoples and wildlife are all covered.  Especially interesting:  Jewell Cave,  Custer and the Lakota Sioux,  Wild Bill Hickock,  early fossils from a very different environment.",1362873600,,206,6.178571428571429
4901874,4,B005X7H9U4,"This is one of the items I debated buying for a while based on such conflicting reviews.  I bought it, everyone is a little bit right. I thought I'd try to add my own perspective in case it could help.

Yes, it is part of the National Parks Exploration Series.  I agree that's misleading because it's really not JUST or even mostly about the parks.  What it does show of Jewel Cave is fascinating, and there are great views of the Black Hills.  But no, this does not visit every park in the area and show you around and give you a little history.  So if that's what you're looking for, you will be very disappointed.

I was looking for a film that had some great shots of the Black Hills and the Badlands, and anything related to the Native American history in the area would be a bonus. For my purposes, this film was amazing.  It's a gift for my mom who will soon be surprised with a trip to Sioux Falls.  She has studied the Lakota extensively, and after watching this, for the first time, I understand why she has been mesmerized by the Black Hills her whole life.  Just knowing she would soon be setting foot there for the first time made me more excited to see the landscape.  I truly enjoyed the Native American history portions.  Again, if you were hoping this film would take you around to different parks, I'm sure it would seem strange to find yourself sitting there listening to a history lesson.

Geology and Ecology are discussed in detail as well. At times the shots linger a little too long. I think every insect is given a chance at fame on different blades of grass.  And the part with the turkeys seemd to last at least 3 minutes.  Just turkeys, for a long 3 minutes.

When it went on and on about Wild Bill Hickok I tuned out a little bit. It was not ""bad"" but it just was not something I was interested in.

The lesson on fossils did go on for a while, and did feel like a teacher was talking to you, but I liked it. I'm a nerd like that. When else will I ever hear about animals that lived before my time.  I learned that they know one of the animals was an adolescent by the color of the teeth he had. I like random facts so I was interested.  For the less nerdy, I can imagine you'd want to shoot yourself by the time he picks up the 10th fossil head.

The people interviewed are not overly exciting to listen to, but came across as genuine and knowledgeable.

The narrator does pronounce every syllable, but I think I only noticed that from reading these reviews. It did not grate on my nerves.  I found him calming.

Blu-ray quality was crystal clear. Definitely did not look like a DVD or VHS to me.

In summary, I'm glad I did not pay more than $5 for it.  I am glad I paid the $5 and got to see beautiful landscapes I might not see in person. Unless you're like me and you will sit and watch random shows on PBS or the History Channel, you probably won't sit through the whole thing. But if you're a geology teacher, it would be awesome to show your class Jewel Cave for 10 minutes.  Stalactites, stalagmites...even my 3 year old was impressed.  If you're into paleontology, I think you'd be pretty impressed with the fossil portion.  If you have a soft spot for the Wild West, you will assuredly enjoy the extensive history about Wild Bill.

There is no flashy music, no quick cuts back and forth to the next exciting scene, no beautiful spokespeople reading their lines off cue cards, no trips into town to show you were to get the best breakfast...  But I liked it enough to seek out other National Park films so I can see what else I'm missing.",1362700800,3,3577,4.271916790490342

4901894,2,B005X7H9U4,"This Blu-ray is boring and misguided. How such incredible country can be depicted in such a lackluster way, takes talent. Or maybe anti-talent.

The ""stunning high-definition"" was neither. The subjects, the shots, the angles, the cinematography in general, was amateurish and unspectacular.

Speaking of subjects, they chose to waste a significant amount of time on the human history of the region. Recreating Custer's Last Stand and Wounded Knee has nothing to do with the grandeur of these parks. Then they threw in the life and murder of Wild Bill Hickok. I am not joking.

These parks are vast enough to fill over an hour of a ""stunning high-definition"" Blu-ray, with a tour of the best features. This is what I expected. That is not what I got.",1342396800,14,749,4.881889763779528

Though I really enjoyed most of the film, I can certainly understand the negative comments. The videography is stellar for most of the video, and the sparse narration is informative.

On the other hand, the whole package, as was stated elsewhere, lacks polish. The narrator does over-enunciate, and even then often mispronounces words (Batlands rather than Badlands.) Some of the instructional portions are too long. The commenters could have been more judiciously selected for passion for their subject. An English-speaking Lakota Sioux should have been chosen to give background rather than one whose first language is Adolescent American (or what we in Southern California used to refer to as ""Valley""). Not to say this guy wasn't entertaining. Here are his parting lines verbatim; the very last spoken words of the film:

""The beauty is probably the key thing about it, but just for them to remember that this is also, um, it's a place of history, y'know, uh, a lot a stuff went down around here, and it, uh, it means a lot to us Lakotas if you didn't like, uh, trash it, or anything like that.""",1340150400,9,1200,4.820388349514563
