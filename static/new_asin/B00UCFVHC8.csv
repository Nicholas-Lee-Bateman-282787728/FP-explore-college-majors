7035998,1,B00UCFVHC8,"Pretty ordinary, but fairly decent release. Only 6 discs- so obviously cramming up to more than 5 episodes on some discs! Gone is the beautiful sturdy box snd beautiful covers of the Japanese sets- now out of print selling at 70000. Perhaps Shout have used the Japanese masters- but if so must have severely compressed them from the 9 disc set.  This is a budget cost set so don't expect miracles.

The new set is really good, but still not up to scratch with the Japanese set. The original audio in Mighty Atom is quite soft, the packaging dreadful and still an echo problem in Sunprobe. Its a really good set, but for the price it simply is not up to the benchmark set by the Japanese set. However it will suit casual viewers who do not expect the best in video production.

If you do no agree with this review then that is fine. However  have compared both sets as I own both .

Discs 4, 5 and 6 of this US set have 6 episodes squashed into the available space- so only 8GB files for each episode , whereas the Japanese episodes are at least 10GB each over 8 of the nine discs used for episodes. There has been compromise of quality here.

A SEVEN disc set is coming out on 18th August in Germany. Obviously, they also realise 6 discs is just not adequate for best visual presentation. Personally, I think that MAY be better too than the US set.",1432166400,8,1348,4.308300395256917

7036000,3,B00UCFVHC8,"I have the British blu ray set that is cropped for widescreen. Even though it is cropped, after a minute or so I did not notice because the prints were FANTASTIC! The restoration was superb! I would not expect this kind of love from SHOUT as the Vincent price sets were just scanned at hi-def and put out as is. There appeared to be NO restoration of any kind. A good example would be  V. Price's ""The Last man On Earth"". In that case it has white speckles throughout making my dvd copy the superior print. A real shame as I have been waiting for this great film in hi def for a long time. Americans will buy anything that says ""Remastered"" or ""First time on blu ray"". If its not a major label don't expect much. I buy all my blu rays from overseas now as I have learned my lesson. The region B prints are almost always RESTORED (hear that SHOUT?) where the US copies are crap. Wait for reviews and screen-grabs before you bite.
Get a region free blu ray player (they are not expensive) and enjoy hi def as it was meant to be enjoyed.

7036002,5,B00UCFVHC8,Ever since I backed the 50th Anniversary Thunderbirds board game on Kickstarter ([...]) I've been watching the series and I'm amazed at the attention to detail they put into the series.

7036003,5,B00UCFVHC8,"It appears that SHOUT! Factory did use the Japanese masters for this BD release and Shout!'s results are comparable.  It IS the original 4x3 aspect ratio, which should make most fans happy.  It doesn't look as great as Screen Archives Entertainment's BD release of the two movies, but they were filmed to show off lots of detail on a theatrical screen whereas the series was filmed to be shown on a low-resolution 19"" diagonal (or smaller) TV screen from the 1960's where it was next to impossible to make out certain details (BTW, if you want to order that 2-movie set, Screen Archives has the best price - even with shipping costs).  For a 50-year-old TV show to look this good in HD is ... impressive!

In my original pre-release ""caveat"" which I wrote before much info about this then-upcoming American BD release of the TV show was known, I had compared the UK ""widescreen"" BD edition where the top & bottom of the original 4 x 3 images had been cropped to fit a 16 x 9 screen, to the Japanese BD edition, which left the original aspect ratio intact (& how the Japanese BD looked gorgeous), along with some other info, with hopes that SHOUT! Factory would be using the Japanese masters for their BD release in the US, and that I would revisit this review once I had viewed these discs (which I have now done).  My intention was to provide a caveat to the consumer who might not ask certain questions, and without knowing the facts about the set beforehand, hastily pre-order it (& have to go through the hassle of returning it if it was not what was expected).  This spirit of consumer protection was not received favorably by some who questioned a ""review"" of a product I'd not seen yet.  It is now a moot point.

The set is out, it lives up to my high expectations for it, and my updated rating reflects this.",1426204800,22,1816,4.4652567975830815

7036017,4,B00UCFVHC8,"Every review I've read raves about the video quality of this Blu-ray set, so I may be alone in my disappointment at the moderate blur throughout the first episode (and I'm assuming this is how the whole series will look). To my eye, this looks like a high-quality DVD, not the 1080p transfer I read about. Is it owing to the age of the film? I own numerous Blu-rays of movies and TV shows from the 1940s and '50s that have sharper images than this. Was the show shot on videotape? I can't find an answer anywhere.

All the same, I'm glad to have this phenomenal show on Blu-ray. And it occurs to me while watching it, that the set would make an excellent present for a model-jetplane or -spacecraft enthusiast -- especially a young person who may never have heard of the show before.",1492214400,,783,4.4
7036018,5,B00UCFVHC8,"A classic from childhood - many a Saturday morning was spent waiting to see ""International Rescue"" solve their latest problem. Even as a kid, it was very noticable that these were puppets/props/etc. - but that was merely something noticed unconsciously, since the storylines (though quite often outlandish) were extremely well-written. Add in one of the most iconic openings of any children's program (accompanied with the stirring ""Thunderbirds March""), and I suddenly feel years younger.
My 5-star rating is purely my viewing experience (both originally, and with this set). The program may not appeal to today's children (but I would sincerely hope so). However adults would probably appreciate the cold-war references - as well as their own flash-back to Saturday mornings. On a side note: I think aspiring filmmakers could pick up some SFx tips from viewing these.",1491264000,2,869,5.350364963503649

I merely want to comment on something that I found hilarious. Any hardcore Thunderbirds fan knows that Gerry Anderson hated the John Tracy puppet, which is why his character was always stuck up on Thunderbird 5 and rarely ever got to participate in any missions. So there were 6 discs in this set, ostensibly one for each Tracy brother and one extra. Imagine how funny it was to open it up and see: Disc 1 with a picture of Scott, Disc 2 Virgil, Disc 3 Gordon, Disc 4 Alan, and then Disc 5 with . . . . BRAINS!?!?!  Disc 6 went to Lady Penelope. Once again, John Tracy gets the shaft. Gerry Anderson is dead but his petty legacy lives on.",1489276800,,800,4.298013245033113

7036026,5,B00UCFVHC8,"It's better on DVD. The Thunderbirds employ superb  model building and weathering techniques. There's always something about building models compared to computer generated graphics, they seem more realistic rather than electronic in appearance. CGI (computer generated images) have that washed out look and you can't touch them as you can with real models. That's why i believe the older TV shows and movies are dated but more realistic to me.

7036031,5,B00UCFVHC8,"I'm going out of my way to write this, out of a love for Thunderbirds and to state a few things I've run into with this Blu-ray collection.

First off, this is the absolute definitive way of owning these episodes. The video is absolutely crisp given the transfer to HD, the special features are perfect and not overdone, and I must say that I am proud to display this on my shelf next to my kickstarted new-1965 episodes Blu-ray.

Reading further into the comments, I noticed some absolutely silly comments and some notable ones. Of the silly, to clarify, these episodes were never shot in widescreen. Those complaining about pillarboxing need to revisit their film history books. This is a TV show.

Of the more serious, and most notable, the Blu-ray appears to not be compatible with ALL players. I use an Xbox One as a primary player, and it had problems playing this disc, and my PC had a similar issue. This disc DOES work on PS4 without issue though, so this is something to keep in mind when buying.

All-in-all, or tldr, this is an amazing set that works in most players, but not all. I'm giving 5 stars because Thunderbirds are go!",1478390400,2,1140,4.546341463414634

7036036,5,B00UCFVHC8,"Geeks and nerds of a certain age, and Brit's of almost any will fondly remember Gerry Anderson's classic ""Supermarionation"" puppet based shows. More modern viewers may recognize the technique as that same one used by the South Park boys Matt Stone and Trey Parker to make Team America World Police a few years back. Well Thunderbirds is unquestionably the best known and in many ways the best of Gerry's offerings. The show wa sthe stuff of dreams for teh late 60's. A retired American Astronaut, now a Billionaire builds a fleet of 4 super vehicles. Flown by his sons, to act as a sort of secret Coast Guard. International Rescue. Monitoring the earth from an orbital satellite the team can swiftly respond to any global crisis big or small. They can go where others cannot, do what others cannot.

While the puppets, are both creepy and yet oddly engaging, the real star of teh series is those amazing vehicles. Thunderbirds 1 through 4 and the Sattelite Thunderbird 5. We atched breathlessly each week to see them. If ever you wonder what the evolutionary step that got us from old school Flash Gordon and Captain Video type SciFi to 2001 and Star Wars effects and design work. This show is it. The late Derrick Medding's masterful designs were cutting edge yet incredibly grounded back in the 60's. And they still hold up well today. Everything about the show is grounded and oddly believable. Thunderbird 1 is a fast responding atomic powered Ballistic Ramjet. A true hypersonic transport designed to launch and arrive first and act as forward command and control. Much the way a Fire Chief does in his Chief's car for real emergencies. Thunderbird 2 is the heavy lifter. A massive VTOL cargo craft with a host of swappable cargo pods that can be loaded and equipped with a broad range of specialized ground or water vehicles. From high tech fire fighters to specialized digging or collapse rescue craft. You never know what will come out and watch breathlessly each week. Thunderbird 3 is the atomic orbital space shuttle. Mainly used to service the space station or to perform orbital rescues of astronauts. Thunderbird 4 is the least seen and arguably weakest of the lot, the small submarine. Carried in Thunderbird 2 it is a DSRV with robot arms. (Of all the vehicles Thunderbird 4 stands out as something of a holdover design wise from earlier shows. It feels more Stingray than Thunderbirds. The other three main vehicles actually not only look believable, but have been proven to actually be not simply viable, but outstanding aircraft designs by several major universities. T 4, not so much.)

Perhaps the greatest charm os Thunderbirds is that while it was a kids show, it never talked down to kids or sought to dumb it down. The show was largely a straight up problem solving procedural. Think Apollo 13 or The Martian as a half hour weekly show. The cast and crew were steely eyed missile men out to save people by solving problems using their amazing technology. All while taking great lengths to avoid having that same tech fall into the wrong hands. While targeted at kids, it treats the kids as adults. It doesn't shy away from the fact that it was a cold war era show. Rather it quietly and subtly factors it in, in real and truthful ways. (Heck in one episode T1 gets shot down over a surprisingly Libya like Middle Eastern nation.)

This show ran for several seasons and spawned two follow up movies Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6. The concept has also been revisited several times. There was a Japanese Anime in the 80's (hard to find), the rather awful Nikolodean Jonathan Frakes directed Hollywood movie from a few years back. And the new reasonably decent CGI offering. While the new one isn't bad... it is still unquestionably a silly kids show. Something that the original managed to never be. All of the new ones pale before the pure genius and fun that was the 60's puppets.

If you like SciFi, and in particular of you have a fondness for special effects and really good model work, Thunderbirds is a must see.",1474416000,4,4049,4.730878186968838

7036059,5,B00UCFVHC8,"The Thunderbirds, which ran from late /64 to /66(depending on your locale in the world),is now brought back to life for all to enjoy with this new set by Shout Factory. While SF can be iffy at times,they have proven what they can do when they do things right. All the original eps are here and they have been remastered beautifully in both picture and sound.
When I look back at this show when it first premiered in Canada,as with all the Anderson's efforts up to that point,I found them to be intelligent shows and not one that was made for the juvenile set with hokey plots and on screen production. They didn't talk down to kids;they actually assumed we had some grey matter up stairs. Another strong point of this shows was the production values and attention to detail,which really made TB's as good as it was. And mention MUST be made of Barry Gray's fantastic contribution in the music department. He is as important to TB's overall success as the Anderson's were. Of course there were the odd on screen faux paux's with animals not behaving as they should,puppets not responding on cue or wheels,those pesky vehicle wheels not turning consistently when needed.
When all is said and done I think of all the Anderson shows the Thunderbirds were the peak of their creativity. They pioneered a form of puppetry and miniature work that stills stands the test of time. And along with a BBC documentary on the show in this eight single sided disc set,you will find it back in all its glorious action.",1452038400,,1501,4.6254681647940075

I cannot understand why ITV have not produced a Region 2 version of this which I would happily have bought at a premium.  Also, they are allowing 3 new original format episodes to be created (now) via a Kickstarter campaign.  I am a backer but think that ITV are missing out on a goldmine - if only they would give the new production team some funding so they could produce a second series.  I am a fan of the new Pukeko CGI series but I am talking about extending the three Stephen La Riviere original style productions that are being filmed at this very moment with real puppets, models and sets.",1447027200,,732,4.392592592592592

It is in 4:3 aspect ratio to preserve the original broadcast of the episodes, so you will have black bars at the left & right side of the screen on a LCD flatscreen TV. I don't know if they could have remastered it in 16:9, the picture would probably look stretched out if they did it in 16:9.

Rather than address or at least take note of a possible bluray authoring problem, they told me it plays fine on other machines - so good enough.  I have titles from a lot of different manufacturers and they will take care of problems when things rarely occur (see Batman TV bluray replacement program Warner did!)

7036099,5,B00UCFVHC8,"I have been a fan of Thunderbirds since I first saw it (on ITV) as a 5 year old, in 1965. I am now 56 years old & it is still as great now as back then. Lets be honest this must be one of the greatest and most popular television series ever made!! I have owned the series in every video format through the years - VHS tape, then DVD, then the first Blu Ray- which as we all know was re-sized/cropped for widescreen viewing 16:9 ratio. That version was ""like Marmite"" - you either loved it or hated it. Personally I did not mind the 'cropping' because I consoled myself with the knowledge that it was 'the best' version we were going to get at that time, and the video quality of the 'cropped' blu ray was excellent. However I always hoped that ITV would bring out 'the holy grail' of Blu Ray versions of Thunderbirds - which would be in its original 4:3 aspect ratio as originally broadcast all those years ago. It was always in the back of my mind that 'we were missing some portion of the picture' - at the top & bottom - I'm a bit of a purist/nerd really!! There was a Japanese Blu ray version brought out in the original 4:3 aspect ratio but it was prohibitively expensive & you needed to remortgage your house to get hold of it!!! All of a sudden news came that the 'Shout' factory, in the USA were bringing out the series on Blu ray in the original 4:3 ratio, & you did not need to be Donald Trump to afford it - it was being offered at a very reasonable price. I pre-ordered it and it duly arrived (from Canada) today. I put the pilot episode (Trapped In The Sky) on first. All I can say is ""I think I have died & gone to heaven""!!! The old cliche ""it looks like these episodes were made yesterday"" certainly applies here!! The images are fantastic and completely blemish free. If you already own the 'British' cropped Blu Ray set - this new 'Shout factory' set is the best 'by a country mile' on video quality, and best of all it is in 4:3 aspect ratio & you get to see ALL the picture as Gerry Anderson intended!! Do not hesitate, all you British Thunderbirds fans (and there are millions of us in the UK) - purchase this immediately - you will not be disappointed. One down side is that I can confirm that this set IS locked to Region A (USA/Canada) so you will need a multiregion Blu Ray player (or a player bought from North America) in order to play them. But, believe me, hang the expense - just do it - Thunderbirds fans in Britain have been waiting too long 'to let this opportunity get away'. Anyway enough of this; I am off now to put on my favourite episode - 'The Cham-Cham' - F.A.B!!!",1435190400,50,2605,4.191235059760956
7036100,5,B00UCFVHC8,"Received my set last week.  Picture quality is absolutely stunning with a rich, detailed, naturally film-like image and no excessive DNR scrubbing.  And best of all one-third of the image is not missing like on the British Blu Ray release.  It has been well worth the wait to see this classic series get the Blu Ray release it deserves in such superb quality and in the correct 4:3 aspect ratio.  Shout Factory and ITV have done and excellent job with this release. Why ITV couldn't have given the same care to the UK release with it's image butchered to create a fake widescreen effect will remain a mystery.

I recently received the German Blu Ray release of Gerry Anderson's 'UFO', which, like the 'Thunderbirds' set, used the same masters as the Japanese set.  Audio visual quality on that set is stunning as well. so and let's hope they have Gerry Anderson's 'Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons' lined up for similar treatment in the near future.",1434931200,14,950,4.7272727272727275
7036101,1,B00UCFVHC8,"I love Thunderbirds and really wanted this blu ray set. So you can imagine my disappointment when I put disc one in my player and it froze my machine.  So I unplugged the player. reset it, and tried again; and my blu ray player froze again, and again with every disc.

My situation my be very rare, in that I have the Sony BDP-7000ES 400 discs 'jukebox' blu ray player.  Interestingly a friend gave me another Shout Factory title to try, On Golden Pond. This disc also locks up my player.  I have to conclude that Shout Factory's blu ray disc authoring is poor.

My 1 star review isn't a comment on Thunderbirds, but Shout Factory's blu ray release.  I'm very disappointed and will avoid Shout Factory releases from now on.",1434672000,2,723,4.480916030534351
7036102,5,B00UCFVHC8,"The new Thunderbirds Complete Series set from Timeless Media Group/Shout! Factory/ITV is a must have for the newly remastered transfers and optional original (UNALTERED!!!) Mono alone! The new transfers are a real step up from the A&E releases (and despite what people say about Shout! and their so-called encoding problems resulting with compression artifacts, I haven't notice or even barely noticed. Don't listen to the nay-sayers, the compression problems are not as you think and like I said, I barely even notice it to not noticing it at all!), beautiful, crisp, colorful, and clean, a HUGE improvement and as mentioned you have the original unaltered mono mix (for the first time ever on the digital format in the US!) as well as the remixed 5.1 track featuring additional sound effects added for said mix when the series was first released on DVD by A&E so fans have the best of both worlds! The DVD and Blu-ray releases also feature a new (and by new, I mean done before Gerry Anderosn's death like before December 2012) documentary Launching Thunderbirds and vintage Thunderbirds publicity brochure as a DVD/BD-ROM extra (located on the last disc of both formats).

But fans should not throw out their A&E sets just yet! If you still have the 40th anniversary megaset, you'll have extras (most of which are located on the 12th bonus disc) not included with the Shout! release including:
-""The Making of Thunderbirds"" vintage featurette (found on discs 1 and 3)
- Pit of Peril with pop up trivia track (separated into 2 parts)
-Another ""The Making of Thunderbirds"" vintage featurette (a different one)
-""The Brains Behind Thunderbirds"" documentary
-Interview with Gerry Anderson

There's also a Best of Thunderbirds DVD compilation which also contains (in addition to the Pit of Peril with pop-up trivia track) 2 exclusives not found on either release:
-Before Thunderbirds Were Go
-Interview with Gerry Anderson (very different one, I assure you)

Given the limited technology of the time, compared to today, it is amazing what they accomplished using nothing more then electronic marionette puppetry. Also unusual for the time was the fact that each episode was an hour long. Although created for children 9 years or older, it proved to be just as interesting to adults. Each action adventure plot was handled seriously, and was never condescending to its young audience, which is why it is just as entertaining today as it was when it came out.
