5774633,5,B005IVX3IM,my wife is a huge fan of the series and always wanted all of them for her own. This christmas she became very happy. The set comes in a mock up of a patients chart which is cool. Impressive presentation. everyone who like scrubs should buy this,1294876800,,244,4.212765957446808
5774634,4,B005IVX3IM,"This is an excellent collection for any fan of the show.  I myself love the show and what better way to feed your scrubs appetite than with this ultimate collection.  I, however after watching the collection have realized that there are a few glitches with it.  I don't know if the movie studio was rushed into releasing this collection before given enough time to properly review it.  I have a feeling that is what happened.  The episode selection option gives you the option to watch single episodes at a time instead of watching them all.  However with this option sometimes the episodes freeze at the end after the credits have rolled and the title screen won't load.  I have found that I have to push stop and then play again to get the disc to work.  Other than that and a few other glitches it is a good collection.",1292025600,34,822,4.469798657718121
5774635,5,B005IVX3IM,"I absolutely love this show, and having the whole collection together is even better... Especially when you get all the extra little gadgets with it.

5774636,4,B005IVX3IM,I brought this for my 22 year old son.  He enjoys the show so much that he watches it all the time when he finds the reruns on other channels.  I decided that he should be able to just watch it whenever he wanted to and I'm glad I did.  He said it was one of the best gifts I ever got for him.,1289952000,,293,3.546875
5774637,5,B005IVX3IM,"This product exceeded my expectations in every way.  I was a bit skeptical because some earlier review talked about picture quality in the last 2 seasons but I didn't notice a difference at all.  Especially for the price, you can't find a better way to complete your Scrubs collection.",1288569600,7,285,4.795918367346939

5774641,1,B005IVX3IM,"Seasons 8 and 9 are presented in 1.33:1 (fullscreen), as opposed to their Original Aspect Ratio (1.78:1). This means you're missing about half the shot that was creatively intended to be in the image.",1276300800,72,200,4.911764705882353
5774642,3,B005IVX3IM,"well, asside from having to repair a couple of disks from season 1 since the completely slipped out of the cardboard jokes so they were viewable, the set was all there, packaging is an utter mess that just takes up shelf space. if you find anything after season 8 of your set is damaged, don't worry about fixing it, the show became unfixable",1509667200,,342,4.444444444444445

5774655,1,B005IVX3IM,Most Scrub fans probably won't know that the series was filmed in HD widescreen as the director had the foresight to see that even though the show was broadcast in 4:3 fullscreen that the future was widescreen and some day the show could be released in HD widescreen.  With the full set being released in 2010 you would think they would release the widescreen original. Did they? NO. A kick in the balls to Scrub fans.  FWIW the only widescreen available is season 8 on Blu ray.,1485734400,3,478,4.482758620689655

5774659,4,B005IVX3IM,One of my all time favorite TV series! The packaging is a bit excessive and will not fit into my DVD racks. The packaging cost it a star but the show is great.,1481328000,,159,3.8484848484848486

5774671,5,B005IVX3IM,"This is the second box set I've had to buy, as my family and I all but wore the last set out. Best single camera medical comedy since M.A.S.H.  My opinion it's the best show ever!! This box set is great for anyone 12+. Older audiences may not get it as it is so fast paced. It jumps around between 3 and 4 stories per episode and younger audiences can have their attention pulled in multiple directions easier. MUST BUY!!",1432166400,2,421,4.2625

5774685,5,B005IVX3IM,Have not watched yet but one of my favorite shows. Common complaint seems to be the tight fit of the discs into their protective sleeves. You need to really tug on them to remove.,1397692800,,179,4.294117647058823
5774686,4,B005IVX3IM,"It all seems nice, the extra stuff is stuck to the front of the box... not to crazy about that. the book that the dvd's are in are a bit stiff I can't open them all the way because of the way it's made.

This is just me nit picking i'm sure it all works and that it's watchable. I love scrubs it's my favorite TV show of all time and this is really great",1395187200,,354,3.72

5774689,4,B005IVX3IM,"I don't really care about the boxed set, I just didn't feel like buying the individual seasons because of the hassle. I wish wish wish there were not all the advertisements on the discs. It actually made me want to just pirate the series since TECHNICALLY I own it now, so according to copyright, it's perfectly legal to have a copy for personal use. Ugh~ads... buy a series, pay for ads.

Anyway, if you've never watched this series, watch it. It makes me laugh and cry every time. I love that there is no cheesy sitcom laugh-track, so kudos to the producers.

Scrubs=win.  a classic.",1392595200,,585,4.552380952380952
5774690,5,B005IVX3IM,"Only downside of this collection is that it includes the horrendous 9th season.

Love the lay out great for all fans, and some wonderful commentaries and extras found within.",1389225600,2,174,5.0
5774691,5,B005IVX3IM,This show is really funny to watch! a cross between a medical drama with some really hard hitting stories and lessons along with the upbeat fun and mischief of friends and coworkers. Also one of the few medical shows that gets it even close to being like actually working int he medical field. Arrived in great condition!,1388534400,,321,4.649122807017544

5774694,5,B005IVX3IM,We love scrubs.  Having the whole collection at our finger tips is awesome.  The only thing is that some of the disks skip.  not very badly and not enough to stall you dvd player but enough to notice.  Other than that its awesome. I recommend this entirely.,1384992000,,257,4.404255319148936

5774696,5,B005IVX3IM,"I love this show.  Don't really care for the packaging.
It comes in a box that slightly resembles a doctor's clipboard.
The discs are in somewhat of a 3 ring binder style holder with tabs for the different seasons.
All the discs did work, but some had scratches from the very beginning.",1375228800,,286,4.5

5774698,5,B005IVX3IM,"Cheaper than eBay prices. Perfect condition for collectors. Unfortunately I don't think Scrubs was released in 16x9 HD. This was only TV standard resolution, which is low by today's standards.",1370217600,,192,5.433333333333334
5774699,2,B005IVX3IM,"I read mixed reviews, and bought it.
With the exception of one or two (oddly) dirty DVDs that needed a bit of shining to work, it was fine.

Until I got to season 4. All of season 4 was bunk and would not load in any computer in the house. One CD even got stuck and wouldn't eject! And all of the DVDs were clean of outside defect.

Anyway, season 5 works just fine.

So, yeah, it could be a good deal, but expect some anomalies. You'll never know what you get.",1369094400,2,461,3.989130434782609

5774701,5,B005IVX3IM,For a fan this is great. Came in condition described. Box is a very awkward size however. Doesn't fit in any traditional place you would keep movies. But all the packaging detail makes it really fun on top of owning the entire series.,1365724800,,234,4.465116279069767

5774703,5,B005IVX3IM,"I love how the disks are stored in a notebook with tabs for each season. The notebook is then kept in a medical-looking clip board, which is just comical to me. I just loved this show when it aired, so I'm happy to have the whole collection now.",1364774400,,245,4.125
5774704,5,B005IVX3IM,Each episode has a specific life lesson at the end which is cool to have that seriousness with how much of a comedy it is throughout the whole series as well.,1362960000,,158,4.129032258064516

5774706,3,B005IVX3IM,"There are hours and hours worth of discs here and 2-3 episodes have skipped on me so far, not enough for me to return it yet. I don't like how the discs are held in the chart holder it feels like they will pop out. Scrubs is a great show and this is a must for huge fans but if you are just a casual fan watch it on your Netflix subscription.",1357516800,,342,3.763888888888889

5774708,5,B005IVX3IM,If you like this show the complete collection is well worth it.  Plus buying it this way is cheaper then getting individual seasons.  Also you get some cool collectibles and it comes in a nice case.,1357430400,,198,4.472222222222222
5774709,2,B005IVX3IM,"The description of the product says that the serie comes with the tittles in Spanish and French, when it really comes with the tittles in English. I feel very disappointed about this.",1357257600,3,183,4.75
5774710,4,B005IVX3IM,"I've held off for years buying this series because I didn't want all the individual season boxes and was super excited for a chance to have it all together in one box. The box design, while neat in concept, is much bigger then I would like making it difficult to find a place where it fits on my shelf. I also don't like how I have to pinch the end of the disk to pull it out of its slot. The series itself is great and I enjoyed watching it again, even the last season I never saw before.",1356220800,3,489,3.9494949494949494

5774712,5,B005IVX3IM,"As a newbie Scrubs fan, I have only been watching for about six months and have already seen every episode at least twice.  It's one of the best shows that has ever aired.  These DVDs will keep it alive forever, and they're worth the price.  There is a lot more than just the episodes, too.  You get Zach Braff, outtakes, alternate lines, Zach Braff, deleted scenes, interviews, Zach Braff, music videos, commentaries, Zach Braff, and a bunch of other stuff!  Did I mention Zach Braff?  If you've never seen Scrubs, you won't be disappointed.  Watch a season or two on Netflix or another such provider, and you'll see.  Just the music that's included in the show is enough to make you want to watch all 182 episodes in a weekend.  And then there's Zach Braff.",1354406400,7,759,4.562962962962963
5774713,5,B005IVX3IM,I am a huge Scrubs fan. I've watched every episode several times. I saw the seasons were on Netflix and started watching them there only to realize that the music in the episodes were completely wrong. As a big fan of the show that kind of threw me off. Being able to watch all the seasons with the original music is fantastic. Great show. Great collection.,1353196800,4,357,4.424242424242424
5774714,5,B005IVX3IM,"if you've never seen scrubs until it's now in syndication... this is a must have. it may be a little pricey, but it is well worth it. Even if youve seen every episode... we all have those nights where the cable or satellite goes out... this is perfect. Funny, witty... yet there is a lesson in every episode even if it's a small one.",1350604800,2,333,4.21875

5774716,2,B005IVX3IM,My first time buying an inferior product on Amazon. Several Episodes will not play.  I wish I could remember how many but I know its atleast 7. Pretty frustrating when it happens.  One disk is almost entirely useless and may become a coaster.  Great series with many many episodes for the money but falsely advertised because you will not get all episodes. If not for this issue I would rate a 5.,1334361600,,396,4.472222222222222

Complete series sets can be hit or miss.  Usually, they include the same discs as each individual season does, packaged together in some manner.  I, personally, am a fan of slim cases in a set like this.  This set uses slide-in pockets.  I will say the presentation of this set makes it one of the more interesting ones I own.  The outer box is designed to resemble a doctor's clipboard, and comes with a JD name tag, a photo-booth style photo strip of the characters, and a strange holograph of the cast which when tilted shows an x-ray-like view (with some rather strange objects appearing within).

There's a paper wrap-around that explains what's in the set and must be removed before the box can be opened.  The box flips open like one of those clipboards with a storage area below.

Inside is where the folders with the discs is found.  The folder is designed to look like patient charts.  The are individual ""folders"" with tabs for each season.  The 9 folders are bound together with bolt-like objects.  They are not tight to the folders, so they move around a lot.  I can see this causing damage if they get handled frequently, since the folders are made of thin cardboard.  The spine is left open, so it is clearly designed to remain in the larger box which takes up a fair amount of space, and ""SCRUBS"" is only written on the longer dimension.  You will not easily be able to store this set alongside season sets of other shows for this reason.

My biggest gripe with this set is that after season 2, the episode titles no longer appear on the discs.  In addition, there is no supplement with episode titles or descriptions.  Seasons 3-9 still have which episode numbers are on each disc written on them, so you can always reference Wikipedia or something if you want the episode details.

The $108 price point works out to about $12 a season.  The season sets individually range from $14-19, so it's a good value for the price.

All in all, it's a good looking set with a few minor drawbacks.  I highly recommend it for any fan of the show.",1327881600,76,2121,4.48041775456919

5774722,5,B005IVX3IM,"... and you shouldn't stop believing;)  Hilarious stuff, rarely going into realms which I wouldn't like a pre-teen to see.  More regular humor, like the type you see in real life, not a bunch of stand up.  Interesting characters, that all have their own quirks, strengths and weaknesses.  ""Morals of the story"" for every episode, that aren't preachy, but are good things to consider.  If you haven't watched Scrubs, you should.  And this combines all the episodes, so you can watch it through, rather than piecemeal (like I did growing up, since I would just watch it when it was on).",1326585600,,584,4.732673267326732
5774723,4,B005IVX3IM,"The package came very quickly and was in total new condition. Overall I was happy with the product, what I was unhappy with was the quality of he DVDs unfortnately. The first DVD of every season would begin with at least 30 mins of trailers for newly released and to-be-released movies. I remember seeing these sorts of advertisements on rental DVDs, however not on DVDs I had ever purchased. You are fortunately able to fast forward through these advertisements, however it did prove frustrating to have to hit fast forward three or four times before I would get to the starting menu.

Overall, a great product especially when you compare the price to the series through online media such as the iTunes store.",1325721600,4,710,4.772357723577236

5774727,5,B005IVX3IM,"The actors of ""Scrubs"" are brilliant.  Why shouldn't they be?  They had some of the most prolific and hysterically-funny lines ever written for a TV series.  It is also a cast that falls into the ""ensemble genious"" category.  They play off each other like an active ball in a pinball machine and score every single time.  Even the characters designed for an audience to hate...you just can't do it.  They are so awful, they're endearing...and that is what magnificent writing is all about.

It is NOT widescreen.  Only the MENUS are displayed in 16:9;  all the contents are 4:3.  You have to buy the bluray to get Season 8 in Widescreen.  Season 9 isn't available Widescreen (yet.)

5774739,5,B005IVX3IM,"I have to say this is one of the best series, I've seen each epidsode at least half a dozen times each and I still thinks it's funny.  Season 8 was kind of a let down, but I thought they did a great job with season 9 bringing back some old blood and mixing it in with some new blood.

If people would have opened up to the new cast I think you would have liked it, yes JD wasn't in it anymore as much, but lets be honest he's one of the reason's I liked season 9 is that he wasn't in it as much, the whiny, needy thing was getting old after 8 season's, keeping Turk and Denise to make the new team of trouble makers was brilliant.

Denise was a shining star and I loved her character.  Her and Drew made season 9 incredibly funny, now on the other hand The new girl who did most of the monologue with the annoying rich kid is probably why season 9 tanked so bad.

All in all I don't know how anybody couldn't love this series, and it doesn't hurt having Sarah Chalke take off her cloths almost every episode, minus season 9 pregers.",1296000000,,1032,4.014634146341463
5774740,4,B005IVX3IM,"First and foremost I would like to say that I am a huge fan of the show Scrubs.  My heart was broken when my ex-roommate skipped town and stole ALL of my DVDs to include seasons 1 through 8 of Scrubs.

I got an e-mail from Amazon.com announcing that they were having a sale on some shows on DVD.  The season 1-9 Collectors set was among the shows named and I jumped at the chance to repopulate my DVD collection with this fantastic show.  My DVD's got to me in a very timely manner (considering I am stationed in Afghanistan).  I as a tad disappointed when I opened the box and found how large the case was that held all of the DVDs (I thought the case would be around the average size so it would fit nicely on my shelf at home).  I was too excited to have my DVDs so I overlooked that detail.  When I opened the silver case that housed a smaller book of DVDs the disappointment came back.  The picture of the case looks very nice but in person it's a bit weak and could tear apart from flipping the pages to get to the next DVD.  Now there's the possibility that this is just my case and not any other, but I'm rating what I have in front of me.

The product description goes on to describe that the boxed set comes with a Sacred Heart Badge, a photostrip of our favorite and commonly seen characters and a x-ray film sheet.  In my opinion, it's not worth buying the boxed set for the items.  It is worth buying the set, however, if you're looking for the added bonus material.  As a student screenwriter, I find great joy in watching bonus footage, to include comic reels and behind the scene looks.  However, not everyone takes joy in the same things as me.

So any fan of the show would be better of buying each season slightly used whether it be from here or from your local video store.  It's the die hardcore fans of this show that should take to buying this as I felt it was only worth the price when concerning the bonus material.  I overall rated this show a 4 simply because of the quality of the case the DVDs came in and the fact that it seems that ABC simply reboxed the DVDs from individual seasons.",1295913600,35,2115,4.182716049382716
5774741,5,B005IVX3IM,"If you like Scrubs I see no reason to NOT buy the complete series instead of each one individually.  Sure the box is nothing special (it's cardboard and looks like a metal clipboard with a pen), inside what looks like color coordinated patient files are tabs telling you where each season's discs are. There are fun colored photos, little tidbits about each season thrown into the collage on every page, a hologram with the main characters where you can tilt it to get their skeleton images (x-rays) that show funny little things inside of them, a nametag, and a few other things.

The discs all rest inside decent cardboard sleeves like every other bargain box set and all 9 seasons are there.

The first episode has odd motion, horrible picture, choppy movement, the commercial breaks have been edited out horribly so it actually cuts some of the scene off, etc....however starting at the 2nd episode everything looks, sounds, and plays much much better.

The picture isn't the best cuz it's a dvd but if you have a decent bluray player it won't look bad.

In summary this is under $10 per season which is fantastic.  Even if the final season with all the original characters was kinda lame and the final two seasons were kind of a joke (even tho I thought the humor got better with each one and I rather enjoyed season 9), thats still 6 fantastic seasons of a show that I'm sure made everyone want to go to med school.",1295740800,8,1421,4.574803149606299
