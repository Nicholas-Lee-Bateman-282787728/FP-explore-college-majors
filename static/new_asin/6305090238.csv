The bottom line Elvis was and always will be the king,and this DVD proves it. I have almost all of his movies because I love his music,style and looks,yes I'm biased because I play and sing his songs with my guitar and dream I'm Elvis at times,but my wife enjoyed this DVD and all the others and love to watch them over and over because we enjoy his singing and some of the comicsl moments in his movies",1478304000,,631,4.266666666666667

Four people (ages 6 - 54), one of which is a mechanic, sat through the movie and all came to the same conclusion...waste of time watching and bigger waste of money purchasing.

However that is a tiny portion of this 'movie' most of the film is banter and filler. It's also really short with almost no special features.

964986,5,6305090238,An outstanding IMAX production voiced by film legend Paul Newman. Super Speedway gives a simple snapshot of what it's like to build and race a high powered machine. The making of is almost better than the movie. A must for any fan of Motorsport,1404518400,,244,4.568181818181818

964988,5,6305090238,"What can I say, I'm a woman who's not especially a racing fan, and I adore this film. Actually not sure what I enjoy more, the movie itself or the ""making of"" documentary included with it. The visuals are amazing, the sound is incredible, and the human interest side of following the Andretti family is fascinating, as well as the restoration project on an old Andretti racecar that they follow simultaneously with building the newest version. It must have been heart-stopping in a large-screen theater, but I'll tell you, it's still awfully impressive in the home. I saw it first it on my BF's laser-disc (yep, still have it - and a working player) but this is a little easier to share with friends and family - and who knows how long the laser disc players will hold out? It's been about 15 years since I first watched it and I still remember sitting there just mesmerized thru both the feature and the ""making of"" special.

I was an early fan of having my own theater (have a considerable collection of LDs' including Super Speedway IMAX) and have enjoyed it for many years. I had this crazy idea to check out the quality of the LD before shelling out $ for the Blue Ray version. Played through a Pioneer Elite combo player. I was blown away by the very acceptable video and DTS sound so I have decided to pass since like many reviewers accurately noted that it is a bit outdated. I gave this a 3 rating because a rating is required to submit a review so the star is really meaningless.""",1397260800,,755,4.4
965087,4,6305090238,"Good movie, mostly about how an Indycar is made. The cinematography is amazing and the IMAX shots of the races are genuinely amazing. I wished I could have seen it on an actual IMAX screen. That being said it translates fairly well and gives you as good an idea as any video could of the raw speed of an Indycar. I did find the sequences depicting the making of the Indycar to be very interesting, I honestly wish there was more racing in the movie as those are the most exciting scenes and the sound is very good (really sounds like they're driving through the room). All in all it was a good movie and I definitely don't regret spending 10 dollars on it.",1396828800,,656,4.298387096774194

965189,5,6305090238,Narrated by Paul Newman. This is an excellent IMAX video anyone who knows who Mario Andretti is has known during his career he wasn't afraid to push it to the limit. This video made about 2 years after he retired from Indycar racing gives you a glimpse of just what it takes to design and what goes into building an Indycar to on track pre season testing. It also shows just how the engines are built and tested. His eldest son Michael now carries the torch for the Andretti family. It also compares the old style roadsters to the new modern day indycars. This video also chronicles just how much testing practicing and hard work goes into a season on the CART PPG Indycar World Series and how racing is an art in itself. All culminating at the end with a beautiful restored roadster that was one of the first racecars Mario ever drove during his long storied racing career.,1392768000,,874,4.46875

965287,5,6305090238,"I'm a racing fan.  I'm an Andretti and Paul Newman fan.  I'm a racing video fan.

I believe that any true fan would love this video, especially at the low price.

It's more a documentary, not so much a movie, and centers around Mario and Michael Andretti and the building and testing of Michaels' IndyCar one year.

No one could narrate this better than Paul Newman did.

Time is spent at Lola covering the designing, fabricating, assembling and testing the car; then at Cosworth testing the engine.  All that was interesting to me; getting a peek behind the scenes.

Some time is spent with the Andretti family that gives insight into their personalities and personal lives.  Those parts can be slow at times.

But the best part is the picture and sound!  IMAX to Blu-ray conversion is perfect and everything is absolutely stunning.  The race footage is exciting and the visual detail amazing.  Most of this film is not track time but what there is may be the best HD racing footage ever done.
It doesn't cover a whole season, we really only get bits and pieces as the film makers were limited as to when they could use the camera car, but it is still really fun to watch.

And the ""making of"" extra is as long as the original presentation and also very interesting and entertaining.

965480,4,6305090238,"I like all the Elvis films with Ann Margaret the other two are just Elvis and the gruopees movies plot.  better watch Love Me Tender. The original title--The Reno Brothers--was changed to capitalize on the advanced sales of the song ""Love Me Tender"". Presley was not too upset about the addition of the title song, he quite liked it, but when several more songs were added he blasted them as ""garbage"" and ""silly songs"".  The film was generally panned by the critics, although a number of them viewed it in a positive light. The Los Angeles Times wrote: ""Elvis can act. S'help me the boy's real good, even when he isn't singing"".  Despite mostly negative reviews, the film did well at the box office,[12] generating $540,000 in its first week alone.  Although Presley was angered by the addition of songs to his film, the fans loved them. The success of both the single and EP set the tone for every Presley picture that was to follow, and the commercial success led to the release of three more Presley film vehicles over the next twenty months; Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, and King Creole. Jailhouse Rock and King Creole (1958), called for relatively dramatic performances. The erotic, if not homo-erotic dance sequence to the former's title song is often cited as his greatest moment on screen,  It was choreographed by Alex Romero after watching Presley himself.  Howard Thompson of the New York Times began his review of the latter movie, ""As the lad himself might say, cut my legs off and call me Shorty! Elvis Presley can act.  His first film after his return from the Army, G.I. Blues (1960), directed by Norman Taurog, set the tone for Presley's Hollywood output in the 1960s. Presley fans loved the mix of songs, romance and humor, and, perhaps surprisingly considering his experiences during the 1950s, critics were also warming to the new formulaic approach and clean-cut characters.  Presley was not so thrilled, and thought many of the songs in G.I. Blues made no sense to the plot. He was concerned about the number of songs in it; unlike his earlier films, which consisted of fewer songs usually resulting in only an EP release, G.I. Blues had enough to release a full LP in its own right. As described by critic Al Clark, it was the ""first in a series of nine bland Presley vehicles directed by Taurog, and the film which engendered a career formula of tepid, routine comedy-musicals. Presley at first insisted on pursuing more serious roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein -- Flaming Star (1960) and Wild in the Country (1961) -- were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. So formulaic that his output has been called ""Elvis movies,"" and a genre unto themselves. The majority of Presley's movies aimed for little more than reliable returns on modest investments and the promotion of their accompanying soundtrack albums.  To maintain box office success, he would later even shift ""into beefcake formula comedy mode for a few years.  For most of the 1960s, during which he made 27 movies, there were few exceptions such as the non-musical western, Charro!",1315440000,,3104,4.828625235404896

The blu ray video quality is very impressive; IMax spares no expense and it shows.  However, if you want true reference quality blu ray picture, I recommend 'Baraka' or 'Planet Earth' in lieu of this film.

I have only watched the actual film once the whole way through.  And, to be honest, it is very 'meh'.  It's a typical IMax documentary meant more for theme parks than a home setting.  So in other words, it's short, shallow, and low on replay value from a story standpoint. It's also getting a dated at over 10 years old.  I would like to see them re-visit Indycar, or better yet, do something with F1.

I am amazed how much more lifelike the (now ageing) footage is in Blu.

I never got too into the whole story portion (refurbishing of a long lost treasure) but it is worth seeing. I can (and do) watch the test track footage over and over and over again... At least until my wife and daughter start yelling at me because the dishes are rattling in the kitchen cupboards... lol! This film is for racers like ""Rudy"" is for football players... It just makes you want to get out there and do it!

If you have a decent to kick-butt theatre, I would say this is a must have demo. If you like going fast or think you may want to be a race car driver, this IS a must have. If you get an uneasy feeling merging onto a freeway, you may want to check out ""Blue Planet"" instead.  (also a great IMAX film)",1262563200,3,1106,4.158878504672897

I was even able to get Marco to autograph a picture I took of him then.

I have other versions of ""Super Speedway"" including a couple on standard DVD. The audio is good enough on the standard DVD to show potential problems in surround sound speaker setups.

965636,4,6305090238,"Super Speedway
narrated by Paul Newman

Few racing movies begin with a tight shot of three fat chickens roosting on a barn beam, but this is an exception. That's just one aspect setting Super Speedway well apart from the usual racing film. Another is, this one is a joy instead of a disappointment, mainly because it features real racers, real cars, real tracks, and a real team. No actors, no studios, no faked footage.

In documentary form, the film cleverly shifts back and forth between two eras, contrasting the restoration of Mario Andretti's first Indy roadster--the 1964 Dean Van Lines Special--with the creation of his son Michael's 1996 Lola/Ford CART car. Both Andrettis and their family feature prominently throughout, with excellent narration by Paul Newman.

Having retired a few years before, Mario helps Michael in pre-season testing of the new Lola at Homestead; the car-to-car footage of the father and son ""racing"" there is fascinating. Afterward, Michael and the Newman/Haas team start a disappointing season. The crew follows them through a few dismal early races then to an uplifting win at Detroit (Michael went on to finish second in the 1996 championship). The action shots of the cars at Road America are amazing, especially those photographed in the rain--and Mario's (intentional) spin in Turn One.

Meanwhile, Michigan collector-restorer Don Lyons drags the dusty old front-engined Kuzma roadster out of the chicken coop with a Farmall tractor and begins its total rebuild in his modest shop, the same kind of low-tech garage where the car was originally built, largely by hand. In contrast, the Lola factory's sophisticated autoclave, wind-tunnel, and crash-testing facilities appear almost other-wordly. The film spends a little too much time showing crashes; although this was intended as part of contrasting the old with the new to demonstrate the relative safety of modern race cars. That time might have been better spent interviewing Mario on that topic, since he has raced examples of both generations.

Photographed on large-format IMAX film, the movie lacks absolutely nothing in quality. All in-car shots appear remarkably sharp and vibration-free, and the sound, though enhanced in spots, is excellent. In fact, one of the most interesting selections on the DVD is ""The Making of Super Speedway"", which documents the IMAX crew's visits to a secretive Cosworth engine lab, a more open Lola Cars facility, and tracks such as Road America, Toronto, Detroit, Mid-Ohio, and Michigan. The movie company even bought an Indy car and adapted it to carry cameras on various mounts; the crew also built a mount for the old roadster.

The film ends with Mario and Michael seeing the restored roadster for the first time as it is rolled out of the rural shop onto the restorer's lawn. Mario then takes it for a great autumn drive on a back-country road, blowing leaves everywhere and waving to a farmer on a tractor. Totally illegal, of course, but very sentimental, as you watch him go back in time. Apart from Grand Prix and Le Mans, which by now seem rather dated, this is the best racing film you're likely to see.

You can watch it on DVD or Blu-ray at home, but in an IMAX theater, Super Speedway must truly live up to its name.

One disk is the regular Super Speedway from IMAX, but in NTSC. I took NTSC since the PAL version is out of production. When I played it on my DVD player, I was shocked to see how fuzzy 480 NTSC lines are compared to PAL's 576.

No matter, I thought, I bought the disk set for the HD version anyway. So I popped the disk in my PC thinking I can stream the WMV files through my media streamer at my home theater. Another shock as I realize that the WMV files are encrypted not with standard DRM, but with some proprietary technology.

I don't know... I don't like the idea of those discs.

They are bound to have more scratches, fingerprints and so on when you manipulate them.

When you put the disc back in the case, you will leave marks on the disc, unless you wear cotton gloves or something.

Apart from that, it's a GREAT deal, excellent price for 3 movies, if you don't already have them.

I'd give it 5 stars if the set was for 3 discs, and not 2 (one being double-sided)

965852,5,6305090238,"I don't own this DVD - yet...but I will!
I just saw this at a friend's house who has an HDTV rear projection TV, and a decent audio system ... Audio and video were of the utmost quality - no grainy translation of color or image to the HDTV's screen in widescreen format, even though the DVD is too old to be HD.
This has got to be the best quality DVD I've ever seen from a presentation standpoint.  Even if you don't like racing, I would be willing to bet money that you'd still like this for its excellent documentary quality.  Though this film is older ('97 originally - in IMAX) it is still a very true to life behind the scenes story (I work in motorsports).  It is captivating and interesting to see just how an Indy car team lives and breathes year-round.
The sound is incredible!  One scene shows Mario and Michael Andretti working on something in the paddock area while there are cars out on track testing.  You actually hear the cars on the track in the background going AROUND your viewing room as if you were standing in the paddock with the Andrettis.
The in-car/on-car footage is the same - a racing competitor comes up to pass on the left; you hear him in the left-rear before you see him, then the nose of his car appears and the sound is beside you (in both front and rear speakers) and finally as he passes the sound of his car moves to the front, all with appropriate volume levels.  You can almost feel the steering wheel in your hands!  And the visual experience of going 180-200 MPH around Homestead is astounding!  None of this watered down, graphic crowded, short focal length/narrow-angle view junk you see on TV...You get a VERY GOOD idea of what it's like to travel at such speed in an open cockpit car!!  Wind noise and all!  Unbelievable!!
Truely the most immersive home theater experience I have seen to date.  If you want to test or show off your system, if you like racing, or if you like documentaries, you should NOT deprive yourself of this absolutely awesome experience.  It is truely amazing - even the (non-racing fan) wives of the world will enjoy it :-)",1053216000,14,2093,4.436031331592689
965853,5,6305090238,"I own this DVD.  I just wanted to respond to the review from Mike M. below.  Another reviewer commented as well, these scenes are NOT sped up.  The racing in the CART and IRL series is REALLY this intense!  That's why these drivers are truly althletes, contrary to much popular belief.  This film was shot a few years ago and the driver's heads really bobbed around as Mario's did in this movie.  The newer race cars have padding and safety features which limit the head and neck movement for safety reasons.
I had the opportunity to race an open wheeled car at a racing school, and this DVD accurately captures that seat-of-the-pants feeling.  The only thing missing was the wind whipping past your head.
This is a great DVD, and I highly recommend it.",1048464000,,753,4.574626865671642
965854,3,6305090238,"As others have said, the DVD is great, and probably even better when seen in an actual IMAX theater. I think I found the making-of documentary actually more interesting than the feature itself. It was interesting to see the challanges of mounting a 70 lb IMAX camera on a car that was engineered and designed taking into account where every ounce is placed.  Hanging 70lbs on it and still expect it to perform is quite a task.
I felt the audio was not accurately dubbed at some points. Too many/not enough gear shifts, mixing of two audio tracks with different engine RPM without a break in the video.
The biggest thing I had a problem with is the fact that it seemed several shots were sped up a bit to make it look more intense.  Thats not cool.  I hate when ""World Scariest Police Chases"" does it, but its expected from them.  To have it done in a professionally done IMAX feature just is not acceptable.  If you look at the on-car shots, watch Mario's head bouncing around.  He doesn't have a natural movement- it moves to fast.
IMAX is supposed to bring the awe and adventure of things the normal everyday person will never experience.  I feel there is a certain responsibility to bring it to us true, not buttered up.",1028419200,6,1223,4.481981981981982

There is a making-of for the entire film, chapter by chapter, but unless you're the kind of person who can read a popular science from cover to cover you might not find it that exciting.

Veteran driver Mario Andretti as well as his son Michael take to the wheel of a specially-rigged CART racing car that has an IMAX camera attached to it. The footage is spectacular!
At the same time we get inisghts into the technology side of racing, with visits to the Lola and Cosworth factories in England.
Mario Andretti's first race car was the Watson roadster, and as a special treat in this movie we see him re-united with the very beautifully restored car.

965947,2,6305090238,"Boy was I disappointed when I watched this!  IMAX films are generally designed to wow viewers in their exclusive massive theaters with hundreds of speakers and a monster sound system.  But the story-line, dialog and every other aspect of the films are are pretty sterile, contrived and basically boring.  Well take away the big theater and what you get is the lame story and only a glimpse of the films visual and audio impact.  (Yes, I've got all the cool stuff, 42"" TV, DTS, 200W/channel...blah blah blah).  There lots of IMAX-y shots that start at a distance then slowly zoom in.  In the IMAX theater the crowd goes ooh and ahh.  At home you go huh?  And don't expect any real racing excitment.  They show a few random clips of a race, then wha-la the winners are spraying champagne.  The dialog is presented as if it's genuine, but it's obviously scripted.  The test track footage is pretty cool and the engine sounds are good but inconsistent,they have to turn them down so you can hear the lame dialog.  Mario Andretti is of course way-cool, he can't help it.  And if you're into it (I'm not) there's a handful of old clips of horrific crashes, most of which someone was killed (neat huh).  These are not filmed in IMAX.  I haven't watched the making-of bit yet but I'm sure it's more interesting than the main feature.",1017792000,,1325,4.578723404255319

The story is interesting as they take a race car from concept through construction and testing. Suitable for the whole family.
My only complaint was in the description..that says it's in ""1.33"" (fullscreen) format but also states that it is ""Color, Widescreen, Dolby"". It's not widescreen, it's 1.33. Does this match the original IMAX screen-ration? I don't know but that would make sense.

What I  didn't expect is how much I enjoyed the human interest story of the  Andretti family. The movie takes you into their world, and places racing in  perspective: technological, historical, and social. The story arc gently  draws you to the racing track, immerses you in the raw excitement of  driving at over 200 MPH, and then eases you back out to the real world,  your heart still pounding. While the cars are unquestionably exciting, this  isn't just about sitting in the cockpit. It's really about the people who  do this, from the driver all the way back to the car's designers.
In the  ""Behind the Scenes"" video (an outstanding piece in its own  right), the director points out that you couldn't invent a story like this,  that no one would believe it.

However it is the first DVD  I've seen (of 30 or so) that has visible compression artifacts.  While most  of the video is sharp, there are some glaring problems in spots.  For  example, in a long shot of the track, the cars in the distance look like  they're emerging from a fog.  It's a disappointing IMAX transfer consider  the very high quality of the source material.  I watched the DVD on a 100  inch high definition projector.  These problems will probably not be  noticeable on a 30"" regular (NTSC) television.
