1007546,3,6305261415,"If you are not very exigent with good plot an credible villains you can watch this. The best are the scenes with Chan, Hung and Biao together. The fight of Chan in the boat is good too and of course the final figth have some good moments. But the villains are cartonboard in despicted of the plot and the romance scenes doesn't add more dimension to the characters. Like others Chan movies this is basically a fun movie with some good action scenes. Perharps it can be a three and a half stars movie but if I have to decide between 3 or four I give 3, because the bad villains .
If you can rented first do it and the decide, if not I can say Chan have worst pictures but buy it used. Good DVD extras if you are oriental, many trailers and you are not going to be disappointed with captions, you have English and then: Thai, Chinenese, Japanese, Korean and many others, 2 languages: chinese mandarin and cantonese.",1004572800,,913,4.313953488372093

1007548,5,6305261415,"This is probably my all around favorite movie from the trio it
has very funny moments and has a good amout of fight scenes
the final is a knockout my only complaint is some of the fight
scenes are speeded up a little bit and they don't show enough
wide shots of some of the fights. Also some of the scenes at night are kind of hard to see. But still is execellent and worth buying if you like the trio of legends so go out or order
it now you will like it i am sure of that.",1000944000,,474,3.797979797979798
1007549,5,6305261415,"The reason I think this movie deserves a four star rating over a five star rating is simply because of the scenes with all three brothers; there just aren't enough!  I LOVED how they played the three heroes that worked together in Project A, but here, their working together is constantly shrouded by their innabilities to cope with one another; mostly Sammo's and Yuen's characters'.  In fact, the only time that you see the three fight a fight together is between each other!  Personally, I didn't much care for the bar fight, for it seemed rather randomly placed, as well as hard to follow.
Anyone who has seen these three men knows that they are all martial arts masters!  When the three of them fight each other brutally outside of Ling's house, while the scene was only about a minute in length, it was one of the best martial arts scenes I've seen yet.  The end fight scenes were masterly done as well.  The fight with Sammo Hung trapped in the factory was quite good, and then the one where Jackie Chan and Yuen Baio come to find Sammo Hung was incredible.  Especially the fight between Jackie Chan and Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez.  I'm sure you've heard about the two famous fights between Jackie and Benny; they're both considered legendary, and I say that they are every bit worthy of being so.
Under this action, however, is still an enjoyable movie.  No matter how predictable I found Jackie's big question in the end court scene to be, I still loved the scene throughout.  I also liked how Yuen Baio was clearly mentally disturbed, yet as we see him, we find out it isn't a disturbance of mind in a bad way necessarily.  True, Yuen Baio is the weakest actor of the three, which is why I think he was the most seldom seen in their six movies together, but he least could handle almost all of what he did.  The scary bits were creepy, the happy scenes sure were bright and cheery, and the main villain was one to hate all right!
All in all, I can't think of any other way to end this review than saying: This movie, while not beyond belief, is still very enjoyable and adrenaline pumping!",999302400,4,2097,4.475065616797901
1007550,5,6305261415,"Wanna see three of the greatest martial artists at their best?  Then this is the movie for you.  Amazing fight scenes and a breathtaking fight between Jackie and Benny the Jet at the end.  You'll be rolling on the  floor laughing when Jackie, Sammo, and Yuen get mad at each other and start  fighting.  One of Jackie's best movies.",947980800,3,331,4.52542372881356
1007551,3,6305261415,"First let me say this is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies, especially with the addition of Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. Lots of great fights and stunts, but unfortunately none of the standard Jackie Chan outtakes at the end of the movie.
The DVD transfer is not up to Hollywood standards, but considering the source material it is not too bad - much better than the pan-and-scan VHS version I had previously seen.
The re-mixed Dolby Digital 5.1 sound was relatively clear, but the sound effects during the fight scenes were overdone with typical kung-fu movie sounds whenever characters took a swing or made a kick. This was very apparent when Benny the Jet ""cracks"" his neck - it sounds like he's made of balsa wood. This is no different from the VHS version, but with the directionality of the surround mix, the sounds become even more distracting.
There were some differences from the VHS version: a scene was missing where Yuen Biao visits his psychiatrist. This ommission makes his character's motivation a little harder to understand, but other than that you're only missing out on a little comedy.
Also, there were no subtitles to the song lyrics in the middle of the movie. This is unfortunate, because the subtitles on the videotape version were unintentionally hilarious (""our hearts walk arm in arm...a touch, and sparks of electricity leave my heart strings atremble, love is conveyor belt of warmth""). DVD owners will miss these wonderful lyrics.",922233600,10,1461,4.895161290322581
1007552,4,6305261415,"This is the last of a legacy of collaborations between Hung, Chan, and Biao.  The fight choreography in this film is top-notch.  The story however fails to rise from a hokey Canto-comedy with some dramatic elements, to  meet the quality of the action.  This film show cases a second encounter  between Benny ""The Jet"" and Jackie Chan.",921715200,,334,4.7894736842105265
1007553,4,6305261415,"This was the last installment of the ""Peking  Opera brothers"" series starring Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung, and Jackie Chan.  Chan plays a playboy lawyer who woos every girl he sees; Hung is his clumsy, rotund  friend; and Biao, a deranged handyman.  The movie has the feel of a 1970's  Chinese soap opera (the music is AWFUL), but it's quite funny at times.  Chan's off-beat humor is cute, and the antics of Hung and Biao are  ""stupid silly"" but provide a good laugh.  The fighting scenes,  however, are worth the money.  I was surprised at the unnecessary footage  of raw violence, but they give you the viewer a good feel of how incredible  the stunts really are.  The acrobatics will blow you away, and the final  fight with Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez is one you'll never forget.  This is the only movie you can buy that has Biao, Hung, and Chan fighting  each other.  Props to Hung's stunt choreography.",917136000,,899,4.5886075949367084
7887341,2,6305261415,Ordered on blu-ray and audio-to-video synchronization was off. Played on multiple players and experienced same issue; had to return. Good movie though.,1517961600,,151,5.909090909090909

7887343,4,6305261415,"The movie starts off with the low hum of a synthesizer and the titles flash on the screen, ""Dragons Forever"". How could a movie like this not be good? Another 1980's collaboration (Project A, Wheels on Meals) with Chan, Sammo Hung and lesser known Biao Yuen as a sort of kung-fu three stooges.

Within just a few minutes of the films opening, we see Jackie Chan breaking out some of his patented brand of high octane martial arts. We also get to see some of Sammo Hung's unique fighting abilities, which is pretty impressive considering his size and finally Biao Yuen shows off some of his incredibly acrobatic stunts. One thing that immediately stands out in this movie to me is the music. It's mysterious when it needs to be, fun when it needs to be and suspenseful when it needs to be.

There's just something different about seeing Jackie fight in a black suit and tie opposed to his later acid washed jeans and white t-shirt look. The fight scene on the yacht is absolutely unbelievable and some of Jackie's best stuff ever. As usual the final fight scene is also incredible and impressively incorporates all the main characters. Hopefully this movie will get a proper blu-ray release soon, it definitely deserves one.",1400457600,2,1223,4.710280373831775
7887344,3,6305261415,"The movie is very good. But, its not the same cover and title that was showed when I purchased it. Anyway, the movie is nice and Jackie Chan's awesome.",1279411200,,151,4.241379310344827
7887345,4,6305261415,"I finally got around to watching this, and boy have I been missing out.  If you enjoyed the famous H.K. trio (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Bio) from Wheels on Meals and Project A, then you will undoubtedly love this film.  Dragons Forever has more of a Wheels on Meals feel to it then Project A for sure, especially with Benny Urquidez returning for a dream matchup against Chan once again.

Dragons is a difficult film to aquire, and is pricey on dvd.  In addition, I have not seen any English dubbed version availbale either (not that that is a bad thing) but some people, like myself, don't do well with subtitles.  The option I chose was to record it off of Spike TV.  To my surprise - subtitles.  Who'd ever thought.  It actually wasn't that bad, I really got into this film.  The trio is simply amazing, and though they don't have too many scenes where all 3 are on the screen at once, you can feel a chemistry anyways as a viewer (especially if you have seen Meals on Wheels).  I would say there are not an overabundance of action scenes, but in between the story still captured my attention well.  Its not everyday you get to see some fun love stories unfold in martial arts films, and I have to admit, though a bit silly and maybe cheesy, I enjoyed Chan and Hung's never-ending scenes of winning over their loves.

The action again is limited, but the scenes themselves are not.  Dragons has some of the best martial arts choreogrpahy I have ever seen.  Everything is so fluid and acrobatic, well timed, and just eye-poping.  Chan's fight against Urquidez is a huge treat, though not as long as their fight in Wheels on Meals, it is still a solid 4 minutes of intense excitemnet.  Benny gets barely any screen time before his fight, but he just looks evil in this one (in a cool way).  And if that wasn't enough, Yuen Bio fights Billy Chow (bad boy in Fist of Legend) too.  Billy Chow gets some more screen time, but I think he only has one line in the whole film.  This is one of his earlier film appearances too.

Dragons is easily one of the best Chan movies created, and perhaps one of the greatest H.K. martial arts cast every assembled.  If you were like me and haven't seen this yet, you are missing out.  It's a shame its hard to find and expensive, but it just might be worth it.

This is a film that Dragon Dynasty should consider re-releasing.",1190246400,,2368,4.3807339449541285
7887346,5,6305261415,"Jackie chan is amazing.  Sammo Hung is amazing.  Yuen Biao is amazing.  Put the three of them in a movie, and it'd be hard to end up with something bad.  Well, in this case, you end up with something great.

To begin with, there's the martial arts.  These guys are three of the best Asian cinema has to offer.  Yuen Biao, though not widely know in America, is considered to be one of the most athletic martial artists around.  Of course, Jackie and Sammo are no slouches either, and this movie delivers a lot of colorful action.

But it's also funny.  It reminds me of those old screwball comedies of the fifties.  It's ridiculous, absurd comedy based on misunderstandings and well-intentioned deceptions.  The scene where Jackie's date is interrupted by his two fighting friends is damn funny.  And the interaction between these three friends is what makes this film a classic.

For another great collaboration of this terrific trio, check out ""Wheels on Meals"", another fine film.",1132358400,,982,4.802395209580839
7887347,3,6305261415,"Jackie Chan's box office success with the Rush Hour movies has cemented his reputation as a film legend. Although fellow martial artists Samo Hung, Yuen Wah and Yuen Biao will never reach his status, their fights together in Dragons Forever (MIA) rescue the film from its convoluted plot.

Jackie is blessed with the grace of Kelly, the stunted charm of Roger Moore, the comic timing of Benigni and the nose of a caveman. Despite a few colourful bruises, his nose survives Dragons Forever intact. The same goes for his romance with the heroine - it's not without its kicks and twists, it takes a hammering but goes the distance.

Jackie plays Mr Lung (nickname: Big Nose), an unorthodox lawyer whose techniques include beating up a client and forcing a witness to admit her love for him while under oath. The narrative defies logic at times, with characters acting erratically. The blame for this must lie with director Samo Hung, who gives some of the best scenes to the loveable arms dealer he portrays. Fed up with living in Jackie's shadow, he made no more films with the superstar.

A pity, because any flaws in the plot or the subtitles are compensated by intricately structured action sequences. As with the best Jackie Chan fights, most of these set pieces involve sparse sets and a minimum of props. The audience are left to marvel at slow-motion acrobatics and crafty stunts. The main villain's come-uppance is particularly memorable, as he is injected with hard drugs, falls from a gantry and drowns in a narcotic soup.

Dragons Forever is mercifully economical in length - a herd of extras pile into shot as the credits roll, brushing aside scenes that must have cost more than a series full of Casualties. The audience is left to marvel at the action-clogged climax, confirming GQ Magazine's appraisal of Jackie as 'the biggest martial arts movie star of all time.'",1096588800,4,1878,4.841121495327103
7887348,5,6305261415,"I have watched most of these three brothers' movies, this is for sure on of the best. The fights are as fast as naturally possible- especially the last fight with the antagonist in the factory. I have noticed that Jackie is using his right hand and foot most of the time while fighting, but in this movie he does an amazingly fast tornado kick with his left foot - you have to see it over and over. There is a lot I want to say about this movei, but all I can say is that this movie is so cute that makes you watch it over and over. I wish that these three brothers made more movies of this kind.",1076112000,,596,3.975
7887349,4,6305261415,"This is a must see for fans of the Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, and Samo Hung brother movies.  It is their last film starring together and the action is great.  They have a chemistry which only comes from a long association - growing up together certainly qualifies.  Not only do they fight the bad guys, but they fight each other!  (And Jackie does not come off as the lilly-white hero he usually portrays!)
I didn't like it as much as Wheels on Meals, but for a fan of the dynamic brothers, its a definte must see!  (P.S.  Benny the Jet gets another chance at Jackie)",1024876800,2,564,4.3238095238095235
7887350,4,6305261415,"Yuen Bao, Sammo Hung, and Jackie Chan are like the 3 Stooges of Martial arts.  Only difference is the Stooges could only poke and slap each other, these three martial artists kick bootie!  They are hilarious together and I really wish they made more movies together.  Fight sequences are top notch and very well coreographed.  The story is actually pretty good, and contains genuinely funny and humorous stuff.  The only drawback is that some parts seem a little long--maybe because of subtitle problems.  The subtitling is kind of off with many typos and the like.  Also conjunctions that don't make sense like ""I've to go now."" etc.  I thought it made things funnier, actually, but I would really like to see the movie with subtitles that made more sense sometimes.  (IMO)  In the end, though, I regard this as one of my favorite movies.  When I show guests the flick, I fast forward through some parts.  Great fight sequences between the Opera brothers.  Love it.",1017532800,2,966,4.781818181818182
