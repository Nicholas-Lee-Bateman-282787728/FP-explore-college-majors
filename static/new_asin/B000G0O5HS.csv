The only saving grace is that Diora does a striptease, pops her top (twice), and shows off her 32DD assets.  Definitely worth an hour of your time.  But not for the movie.",1165795200,6,314,4.553571428571429
2597212,4,B000G0O5HS,"Got a chance to buy this DVD after hearing about it from a friend, and I would highly recommend it.

This is not your typical, big budget hollywood movie, and in this case that's a good thing.

I'm a big fan of movies like Pulp Fiction, Sin City, Snatch, and Reservoir Dogs, and while this movie leans a bit more to the comedy side than the movies above, I would put it in a similar category.

Mike Starr and the extremely hot Diora Baird deliver great performances and really made this movie worth picking up for me. While the star is Randy Spelling, these two actors shine and are a joy to watch in every scene and really made the movie worthwhile.

If you are looking for a crime movie a bit on the indie side to pick up, or are just tired of the same old movies, this is worth your time.",1157414400,13,791,4.150326797385621

8128214,4,B000G0O5HS,"The movie is about this small town kid who moves to L.A. to be the drummer in a Salsa Band.  His life goes from zero to sixty in about 10 minutes.  He gets mixed up with these trite old school mafia guys and a weird cop.

He also gets the cute girl at the end.  It is predictable but still kind of fun to watch.

In an interview with an Entertainment Magazine, Diora Baird was quoted as saying, ""I hope people don't get tired of seeing my boobs""  Wow.  Diora are you joking???  I will tell you more after this short paragraph.

About this movie Hot Tamale...  It's basically the story of small town kid who moves to LA to become a drummer in a Salsa Band. He moves in with a friend, and finds out his life style is going to change from boring to exciting overnight.  He gets into trouble with these trite and typical old style mafia guys.  He also has this confrontation with a gay police officer... very weird.

The story is sort of predictable.  It's your basic ""small town boy makes it big in the city"" theme.

Why should you buy this movie?  Because Diora Baird delivers a great performances and because Diora is smoking hot!  She shows off her perfectly shaped 32DDD melons and her gorgeous body in about 3 or 4 scenes. She is cute.  She is hot. She is flirty. She does a strip tease.  She walks around the house topless and she has this sizzling hot sex scene.

Oh ya, Carmen Electra is in this movie also.

I didn't know who Diora Baird was when I saw the movie ""My Best Friend's Girl"" but I knew I wanted to see more and that is why I bought Hot Tamale.

I'm posting photos from the movie.  I suggest you take a peek!  Click above on the ""see all photos"" link.

Get this movie!  I'm voting for Diora for hottie of the year!!

8128216,5,B000G0O5HS,"After all this time... I can still laugh at and with the humor in this film. I don't know maybe my humor is a bit off. The cast chosen for this film works well. I was lucky enough to see a screening of this film at a film festival in my hometown. Heed the rating on this film it is there for a reason.

Though this is a fun movie to see, the fist time through it was a bit of a shock to the system. At the same time, if I could have rolled on the floor laughing I would have. It helps to have a bit of a different sense of humor with this one.",1217980800,2,543,3.641025641025641
