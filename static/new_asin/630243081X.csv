7825817,3,630243081X,"Tiger Claw is a good martial arts movie that actually uses good martial arts in the movie instead of wires and special effects.  Bolo Yeoung is a great enemy.  Cynthia R. really isn't the main star of the movie, though the try to make her out as the main person on the box art.",1350777600,,277,4.111111111111111

6/11: A weak `6' is more like it for Tiger Claws which is a pretty good B flick for martial arts genre. It has good acting, and the story is acceptable enough. I don't feel that it needed to be all that fancy or whatever to make it work for me, so I am pleasantly happy about how the film turned out. Of course, Bolo Yeung is the main star due to his long extensive history of playing the bad guy in many, many martial arts pictures dating back to his debut in Enter the Dragon, but Jalal Merhi is more of a winner in this one. Cynthia Rothrock is real good in it as well. I like everybody's participation in Tiger Claws. Naturally, there is no explanation for the motives of Bolo's character. It is somewhat unfulfilling. At least, the martial arts display in the movie doesn't involve too many fake punches and kicks. So, it's nice for a change. Still, the ending is ridiculous because Tarek and Linda should have maintained a professional relationship. All in all, despite what anybody says even they said it resembles a porno flick, Tiger Claws is a very acceptable martial arts picture due to low-key expectations and production values.",1308960000,,1163,4.511848341232228
7825819,3,630243081X,"""Tiger Claws"" is a run-of-the-mill outing for former Hong Kong action queen Cynthia Rothrock, another chance for premier Cantonese muscleman Bolo Yeung to prove that he makes a good villain, and the breakout vehicle of B-movie dragon Jalal Merhi. Consider the case of Merhi: while this is just another film for the careers of established stars Cynthia and Bolo, Merhi's first proper exposure to the world of low budget fight flicks was one of the few sound entries in an acting career regularly derided for its mediocrity. Just check out some of his later flicks, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Golden-Phoenix/dp/6303298753/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Golden Phoenix</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guaranteed-on-Delivery/dp/B00019PD3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guaranteed on Delivery</a>, and you'll know that it might have for the best that Merhi gave up acting about four years ago. For all its faults, ""Tiger Claws"" is still a passable action film, with Merhi at his best as a martial arts star with his co-performers supporting him.

The story: ace detective Linda Masterson (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) is assigned to the case of a serial killer targeting champion martial artists via a deadly fighting style (Yeung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>). Against her will, she's teamed up with suspended vice cop Tarek Richards (Merhi), who recognizes the killer's style as the Fu Jow - the tiger claw system, a style difficult to master and resoundingly deadly in practice. Together, the two of them must survive the tough streets of Chinatown if they wish to end the case with their lives intact.

Undoubtedly, the film's strongest points lie in its sound production values. This is a movie from a time when even the smallest of film studios were doing their darndest to stand up to the productions of big-budget Hollywood, and the effort here really shows through the smooth cinematography and authentic-looking locales. Sadly, the nominal accolades stop there. Though the story progresses decently for a straight-to-video film, the movie suffers from some bad acting. I'm not talking of so-bad-it's-hilarious acting a'la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/6302722764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat No Surrender</a>, but just a general lacklusterness that you'd expect from any high school drama production, and that's not yet considering Cynthia's trademark whining and Merhi's Van Damme-isms. Most of the cast had never acted in a film before, and even those who had are hardly worth pointing out. Cynthia and Jalal do have a limited chemistry between them, but even their dramatic scenes are worth falling asleep for.

There are about seven fights in the film that top ten seconds in length, peppered among several more encounters that only last a few moments. Depending on whom you're a bigger fan of, it's easy to conclude that either Yeung or Rothrock have the best fights. A minor dream showdown takes places when the two of them get to duke it out with swords and a kayak paddle in two fairly tit-for-tat encounters. Jalal Merhi has been accused of being a strict poser, but his intricate katas and weapon handling shows a penchant for forms that counter the nay-sayers; but sadly, these skills don't really carry over to his actual fights. Some of this is undoubtedly the fault of the overzealous editing, but the lauded tiger style itself doesn't look all too great on film. It probably would have made for more interesting fights if everybody wasn't hung up on making clawing gestures with their hands.

In the end, this movie is worth adding to your Rothrock collection and is probably the best way to introduce yourself to Jalal Merhi if you so wish, but only buy it if you know how to appreciate the little things of movies like this.",1262563200,2,4192,5.9816666666666665
7825820,4,630243081X,"I rember seeing this movie on tv once long ago and in my local vido store before it went under some years ago and thought it was decent, but then again, I have always loved B movie action/horror flicks..

Bolo is good in this movie, and so is Jalal and Cynthia. The second movie is also good and I would avoid the third movie.",1253664000,2,326,4.09375
7825821,4,630243081X,"I actually saw Tiger Claws II (on dvd) before watching the first Tiger Claws (vhs only).  The 3 big stars from Tiger Claws, Jalal Merhi, Cynthia Rothrock and Bolo Young, return to Tiger Claws II, and some newcomers as well who are pretty good martial artists from other movies.  I had expected the sequal to be more exciting than the first, but as most sequals go, the first is better, and in this case too.

The biggest reason I like the first Tiger Claws is the story.  Jalal Merhi and Cynthia Rothrock play 2 cops who are on a case to discover who has been brutally murdering martial art masters throughout town with a stlye known as ""Tiger Claws""  It isn't until about 1/2 way through the movie we discover who it is, but the 2 cops still have no idea, and end up thinking it is somebody else,who is also a bad boy, skilled in martial arts.

The action scenes are a bit better than in Tiger Claws II.  We get to see plenty of fighting between Cynthia Rothrock/Jalal Merhi and Bolo Young.  Bolo is his usuall bad guy self in this film, and I like how he really comes out his shell on camera near the end of the movie.  You get to see more Bolo in part II, but he is a bit dirtier in this flick.

Not a real impressor, but Tiger Claws is a bit above average the typical martial arts film.  Its not even a bad film in any way, it just doesn't go out on a limb and get too daring, except for the Tiger Claws style of fighting.",1162166400,2,1426,4.130434782608695
7825822,3,630243081X,"Honestly, this movie is cheesy but not all that bad.  No big surprises who the serial killer is though, but by the way they shoot the scene I think the director seemed to think so.  Okay fight scenes spaced through-out and they do make ""Tiger-Claw"" style kung-fu look pretty vicious.  Would watch if nothing else on and you want to see some pretty good action...acting isn't too great though.",1119225600,2,392,4.6521739130434785
