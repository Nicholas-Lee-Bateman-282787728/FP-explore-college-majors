8601887,2,B00E688HG6,"Switchblade DVD authoring have released a duo of Japanese 'women in prison'  flix - the first of which is entitled ""Hellhole-Inmate 611"".  One can only speculate that this release has been timed to 'capitalize' on the popularity of the WIP genre that the cable TV show ""Orange Is The New Black"" has recently engendered in the general population - even though the 'original production date' for ""Hellhole"" is listed as 2007 - pre-dating the Netflix produced feminine penal potboiler

Sadly, I would have to say that ""Hellhole - Inmate 611"" is a pretty lack-lustre affair that didn't really deliver much of what the 'fan' of WIP films generally looks for in the genre.  This premier offering in the 'series' is a 'shot-direct-to video' (full screen) production that focuses on a specific cell of 5 inmates at an all-female prison.  Each prisoner is 'introduced' with a bit of text denoting the crime that they were incarcerated for and the prison routine is described.  Into this mix a new prisoner is introduced - a beauteous 'pop celebrity' who was busted for assaulting a female rival for her boy friend's affections.  Things start off promisingly enough with the usual 'strip search' intro to the slammer and there is a tension created by the animosity towards the fallen  'celebrity' by one of the head female guards - but little of the 'nastiness' that usually provides the 'fun' in these prison based scenarios ever is developed to full potential.

The plot sorta see-saws back and forth between un-exciting events transpiring within the prison and lengthy sequences devoted to flash-backs by the incarcerated 'pop star' as to how she was duped into a bogus relationship by her super-wealthy devious boyfriend and his 'real' GF - which led to her 'crime of passion' that landed her in the slammer.  There are disappointingly few flashes of flesh throughout the whole affair (heck - there's not even a 'shower' scene - the 'hallmark' of the WIP franchise!) and the principal actress never even gets naked.  I'd have to say that the 'sexually charged' description of the film's content is largely bogus and very little heat is generated within the walls of this particular prison.  The girls featured are all 'cute' , but they spend most of the flik dressed in drab gray prison garb and get up to very few 'activities' that might be considered worthy of note by fans of sex-ploitational cinema.

At least the whole sad mess is relatively 'short' (75 min. playtime) so not too much of your time is 'wasted' - but allow me to save you even that brief slice of life and recommend taking a pass on this particular product (and its' sequential companion piece: ""Hellcage - Inmate 611 - Part 2"") - which is equally dismal.",1407888000,3,2719,4.834051724137931
