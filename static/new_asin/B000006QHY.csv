7904768,5,B000006QHY,"This Trump bio is about his financial comeback after the recession of the early 1990s. It also makes us realize how long The Donald has been in the public eye.  He is Mr. New York. His sister talks about her brother, saying that he is more than just a builder, that he has a ""vision."" Donald himself says he knows what people want and has the ability to get things done.  He supported Bush at the 1988 Republican convention even while some were curious as to whether he might be interested in running for president. Trump played down the idea. Even so, it was clear that he had a strong interest in politics. Trump's divorce from Ivana and his eventual marriage to Marla Maples were big news. He talks about his first marriage, saying it became more of a business relationship. Trump is open and honest. He says what is on his mind. It is easy to like him. Of course, this bio was done before Melania came into his life.",1465084800,2,920,4.374269005847953

One of the best biographies on video that I've ever seen. Worth watching more than once.

Motivating and informative. This DVD packs a punch!",1237420800,3,148,4.88
7904770,5,B000006QHY,"This is a pretty good video tape. A&E covers the life of ""The Donald"" from early childhood to his comeback in the late 1990's. The video features insightful interviews with Donald's sister, mother, coach and a few others.

This video is lean on the how-to's, but I still like it. All of Trump's major ""toys"" are taped in this video (Trump Tower, The Taj Mahal and the Trump Princess, etc).

I have watched this video several times since 2003 when I first bought it. I do not think a Trump fan would be dissapointed. This video is far better than the book ""How to Think like a Billionaire.""

This video is a pretty good deal for around $10.00.",1128211200,6,642,4.423728813559322
7904771,5,B000006QHY,"A wonderful portrayal of all aspects of Donald's life, Trump's biography goes through the good times as well as the bad.  Ranging from his New York assets, to the casino empire in Atlantic City, to his affiars with his  women, watching the video puts you right in the thick of Trump's life.  The  history building up to the present was as fascinating as any.  For anybody  who wants to see a true entreprenuer, a man who survived a near disaster, a  man who is a born winner, rent this video!",962150400,14,492,4.4
