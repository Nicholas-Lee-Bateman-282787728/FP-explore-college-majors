5275604,3,B00979KQ5Y,"Susan Hayward is bigger than life. She fills the screen with her beauty and fire.
I found, in the end, that the tile is misleading; I expected so much more from the story.",1371859200,,171,4.212121212121212
5275605,5,B00979KQ5Y,"Susan Hayward one of the best actresses of her time. A classic lady and wish 20th would release all of her films on video. Especially ""Untamed"" in the original widescreen version.",1368403200,2,179,4.806451612903226
5275606,2,B00979KQ5Y,I love Susan Hayward.  I saw this picture a long tyme ago and liked it but I am now 82 and my tastes have changed.  I did not like the screen writing on this one.  Susan did fine with what she had to work with.  If I were 40 years younger I would probably think it was bitch'n.,1364428800,,277,3.7241379310344827
5275607,4,B00979KQ5Y,"This is a good movie, holds your interest. Good cast and, as usual, shows the great Susan Hayward in a film made for her talent. A must for any Hayward fan. I saw the musical version on Broadway in 1962 with Barbra Streisand making her Broadway debut.",1354492800,7,251,4.361702127659575
5275608,4,B00979KQ5Y,"This film is a real curiosity: it's a sharp, cynical comedy about the fashion industry in New York City. The reason it's a curiosity is that, from the credits (Abraham Polonsky wrote the script, from Jerome Weidman's novel; the movie's stars include Susan Hayward, George Sanders and Sam Jaffe), you would expect a film noir. (And there were film noirs that were set in the fashion industry: THE GARMENT JUNGLE is an example.) But here, the hard-edged dialogue delights in barbed repartee, the action is fast, and the actors perform with high energy, turning the machinations of the plot into an intricate weave of rapid-fire patterns which become as stylized as the entrances-and-exits of a boudoir farce.

This was the third major script that Polonsky wrote set in New York City: the other two are BODY AND SOUL (directed by Robert Rossen) and his self-directed FORCE OF EVIL. Michael Gordon's direction is smoother and much less personal than Rossen or Polonsky himself, which also accounts for the accentuation of humor. This movie is a lot of fun, and it's a relief to see Susan Hayward sparring with Dan Dailey, rather than suffering as she did in so many of her other hits from the 1950s (WITH A SONG IN MY HEART, I'LL CRY TOMORROW, I WANT TO LIVE!). This movie consistently uses wisecracks to propel the story, and it's no wonder that, in the early 1960s, this material was turned into a musical comedy. But I CAN GET IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE doesn't need songs to sell this biting look at ambition and love in the fashion world.",1354233600,25,1533,4.720149253731344

8537191,3,B00979KQ5Y,"I might have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book which was about this completely unethical businessman who would first make money on one side of the fence, switch sides and make even more money, always giving everyone else the shaft. It was fast and funny. The movie isn't. Instead you get a businesswoman competing in a man's world. It isn't the same story. Why they bought the book is anybody's guess.",1388620800,5,417,4.573333333333333
