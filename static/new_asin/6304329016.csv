7868179,5,6304329016,"I just finished thoroughly enjoying this movie - The Story of Esther Costello. Joan Crawford was superb as the wealthy lady who is visiting her childhood home and encounters a child who has been blinded and is deaf due to a terrible accident. After taking the little girl home with her, she does all she can to help her. The story is very moving and Joan Crawford comes across as such a loving person in this movie. All of the actors were quite good. Esther was also played wonderfully well, too. I am having such a good time with my new hobby of viewing older movies. They are so much better in my opinion than the newer ones. This is just a great great movie and I recommend it to all especially if you are a Joan Crawford fan.",1432425600,,729,4.251798561151079
7868180,2,6304329016,"Joan Crawford winds up with Helen Keller.

Sort of.

Joan is rich and, like Joan always is in the 1950's, rich and bored.  So she comes across this wee lass in old Ireland and even the priest says ""take her....take her...."" (not in so many words).  The wee lass is deaf and blind and Crawford is St. Joan, come to help and inspire.

Everything is goins well.  To hell with all the other deaf and blind people in the world, Esther Costello is the ONE TO PAY ATTENTION TO BECAUSE IT IS A JOAN CRAWFORD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!  All the world pays attention to Esther Costello.

Eventually, Joan's ex-husband, Rozzano Brazzi, pays attention, too.  A little too much attention.

Thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars are coming in via fundraisers for Esther.  (Again: no other blind/deaf children).  The ex smells money.  Joan smells trouble.  Esther Costello can't smell anything.

I won't give it all away, but the film sinks so horribly into melodrama and really, Joan should've drove.",1368144000,,986,4.820359281437126
7868181,5,6304329016,The Story Of Esther Costello is a good drama. Joan keeps her performance toned down so there isn't the usual camp flavor of her 1950's output. However it is an entertaining film. Rosanno Brazzi plays a baddie and Joan makes him pay !,1363392000,,233,4.441860465116279
7868182,5,6304329016,"""The Story of Esther Costello"" was Joan Crawford's final film in a three-picture deal she had with Columbia Pictures, the other two being 1955's ""Queen Bee"" and 1956's ""Autumn Leaves"", a movie she starred with Cliff Robertson. In this outing Joan plays a rich socialite who discovers a deaf and blind girl living in squalor in Europe. There she adopts the young woman and works with her through a series of different teaching techniques to form a means of communication. Esther soons becomes a functional young person, but her life is torn to shreads when she is raped by Margaret's (Crawford's character) husband.

 The film would garner Joan a BAFTA (the English Oscars) nomination as Best Actress. For fans of daytime American soap operas Lee Paterson (Joe Reily from ""One Life to Live"") has a supporting role.

 Like many Crawford films from the 1950's ""Esther Costello"" has never seen a release yet on DVD or Blue Ray, but was released on VHS in the late nineties, but it is now out-of-print.

 According to daughter Christina's memoirs Joan hated the filming of ""Esther Costello"". This is proven in letters Joan wrote to Christina while she was at school. Joan was forced to live in substandard conditions while filming on-location in Europe and she would later state that her part was, ""One hell of a demanding role. If I thought I deserved an Oscar for ""Mildred Pierce"" I deserved two for ""Esther Costello"".""

 David Miller, the director of this film, worked with Joan in 1952's ""Sudden Fear"" that rejuvenated her career. Crawford was also one of the ""silent"" producers of ""Esther Costello"".

 UPDATE"" ""The Story of Esther Costello"" comes to DVD for the first time in November, 2012 in an beautiful box set by Sony/TCM called ""Joan Crawford in the 1950's"". The set will also feature the never-before-released-on-DVD films of ""Harriet Craig"" and ""Autumn Leaves""!!! ""Queen Bee"" will also be included.",1294963200,,1906,4.946708463949843
7868183,5,6304329016,"I did not see this film when it first came out.  I was probably too young to really understand it.

Joan Crawford was never a favourite of mine but in this film she excells, as does Rossano Brazzi.  Known before this film for his exceptional good looks and charisma, in this role he showed what a skilfull actor he was.  As a man who at first is after the money that can be made from exploiting Esther Costello`s disabilities, his charming facade slips away as he becomes more and more obsessed with her. It is an excellent performance

Heather Sears played Esther and won a BAFTA award for her performance. Australiasn actor Ron Randell played the sleazy entrepreneur who was also taking a cut from donations to the charity, Sid James was the cynical newspaper man who had a good idea of what was going on.  It was good to see him in a role that wasn`t part of a Carry on film!

I should add that the early part of the film is very moving as the deaf, dumb and blind Esther is taught how to communicate.  I shed quite a few tears.",1281398400,,1031,4.278350515463917
7868184,5,6304329016,"""The Story of Esther Costello"" has to be one of my very favorite movies with Joan. I know I say that all the time but this time I really mean it. At the very least, it has to be one of Joan's very best movies from the fifties. My three favorite movies from this era, of Joan's six-decade career include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harriet-Craig/dp/6303962068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harriet Craig</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Guitar/dp/6303391931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Guitar</a>&nbsp;and this. And they are all so different! If you've seen them all you will know what I mean and you'll know why Joan was such a diverse and talented actress who never delivered anything less than complete and utter perfection!

Here are the basic stats on this movie:
The Story of Esther Costello (November 6, 1957) (Studio: Columbia)
Distributor: Sony Pictures
Runtime Listing: 102 mins.
Screen format: pan and scan
Color/BW: Black and White
(Joan played: Margaret Landi)
Brief Synopsis:
A well-off lady works to educate a deaf and blind girl purely out of the goodness of her heart.
Joan's brief comments on this film: This was my last really top picture...

And these are Joan's costars:
Rossano Brazzi played Carlo Landi
Heather Sears played the title-role, Esther
Lee Patterson played Harry Grant

I really like it when Joan plays a nice person. I don't know why. Because she appears much more believable and there always seems to be a level of continuity in her films like this. In this film, Joan plays the staring role, Margaret Landi who is a very sweet lady. She's a very hard-worker who will stop at nothing to accomplish her goal. And in some scenes it was reminiscent of Joan's defining film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mildred-Pierce/dp/B0008ENIAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mildred Pierce </a>.

Anyway, ""The Story of Esther Costello"" is that proverbial Helen Keller story. ...Compassionate and passionate lady takes on the care of a deaf, blind and mute young girl. However, it is very different in one important regard, this movie is glamorous and very entertaining! After all, can you imagine a movie with Joan that was without glamour?

Once Margaret starts caring for Esther she sees swift and almost immediate changes. Heather Sears was especially talented during these scenes because she truly portrayed a person that was otherwise void of any form of sentient communication! Pretty soon, Margaret's estranged hubby comes back into her life once he hears of all the publicity (and money) that Margaret has raised for her newly-formed Esther Costello organization.

Carlo is as smooth as a silk sheet from Fortunoff and as tricky as a Rubik's Cube. Once he enters the picture the movie almost takes on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Bee/dp/B00005RDRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen Bee</a>&nbsp;feel. Although, keep in mind Margaret is always kind and never ruthless. And, the movie actually ended in the same fashion as ""Queen Bee!""

Joan was always very proud of this movie and only had kind words to say about it. She always regarded ""The Story of Esther Costello"" as one of her career highs and as one of her last great pictures. When asked to share her thoughts about this motion picture Joan stated: This was my last really top picture, and frankly if I deserved an Oscar for ""Mildred Pierce"" I deserved two for ""Esther Costello."" It was one hell of a demanding role, and David Miller directed it superbly, but I played it in my own pitch, the way I thought it should be played,  and I was right.

Joan actually found a longtime friend in Heather Sears. Joan was very proud of her young protege and helped her any way she could. Heather Sears even showed her support to Joan in a BBC retrospective/interview that was conducted several years after ""The Story of Esther Costello.""

Fun Facts:
* This movie was made after Joan left Warners when she was free to work for any studio.
* After ""The Story of Esther Costello,"" Joan didn't appear again in another picture for nearly two years because she was so busy on Pepsi business!
* After MGM & Warners, Columbia is the studio that Joan made the most films for (a total of six.)
* The tag for this movie was: Esther Costello...will live in your memory long after you have seen her!
* This film is based on a book written by Nicholas Monsarrat.
* Like many of Joan's films, this was not without controversy; Helen Keller's associates threatened to sue for libel.
* Desperate for some attention, in 2004 the Material Girl caused a worldwide sensation, yet again, when she announced that her ""Hebrew name"" is Ester!

Regrettably, this movie is not on DVD, yet. I don't know why because it's such a fascinating movie. As you can see someone is offering it on Amazon for nearly thirty eight dollars! Highway robbery. If Joan were alive to see such greed in her name she would call these sellers vultures and thieves for daring to bleed her beloved fans like this! If you are seeking this movie, don't worry though, because it does come on TCM from time to time. Also, you can likely find a much less expensive copy on half dot com or its sister-site, e bay.

I am confident that Sony will issue a Joan Crawford boxed set in the future, though. Wouldn't that be great! Besides this movie, here's what I would love to see on it: ""Harriet Craig,"" ""Queen Bee,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autumn-Leaves/dp/6303011403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autumn Leaves</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strait-Jacket/dp/B00005V4XD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strait-Jacket</a>. There is a huge demand and audience that would gladly buy Sony's Joan Crawford Classic Columbia Boxed Set!

You know, with movies like this, some have said that Joan was the original proponent of women's lib. I don't think Joan was trying to make a statement, other than a woman can find her own way in an otherwise man's world. And dare I say that when Joan reached for the moon she became a star!",1208390400,4,6229,5.382956878850103
7868185,2,6304329016,"Rivercircus' review was well written and I agree wholeheartedly with every word written there. I also agree with the two star rating. ""The Story of Esther Costello"" is boring and trite and I have nothing more to add. Read rivercircus' review for the excellent run down on this mediocre film.",1091577600,,291,4.84
7868186,2,6304329016,"I'm a bit... well, ""dismayed"" is too strong a word, so let's just say ""disappointed,"" since I anticipated much more from this film, especially after reading on the back of the VHS box that Joan considered this her last ""really top picture."" (She later said she thought she deserved not one, but TWO Oscars for it. And, truth be told, she did receive the '57 British Film Academy Award for Best Actress for her work here.)
The problems I had with ""Esther"":
(1)(a) THE SCRIPT. In this film, where Joan's philanthropist character Margaret adopts and attempts to rehabilitate a deaf-dumb-n-poor Irish ragamuffin, Margaret's attempts at teaching Esther reminded me not of a cinematic homage to Annie Sullivan and Helen Keller, but rather of Joan's scientist character working with a captured prehistoric troglodyte in her last (and very-bad-because-it's-dull) film, ""Trog."" Especially annoying is one particular scene where Margaret interminably repeats ""Clap hands"" to the unfortunate girl, who's trying her darndest simply to go to the bathroom. (That may seem a trivial beef, but since the transformation of Esther from lost cause to cause celebre is an important part of the plot, it's imperative that the process be at least somewhat interesting and/or moving. It's not.)
(1)(b) Did I mention---THE SCRIPT? If it's not rather ridiculous, it's more-than-rather inept. Re the former ridiculousness: If Helen Keller herself (surely the Queen Bee of the deaf-n-blind) didn't manage to inspire such huge Nazi-esque rallies as Esther presides over in this film, then why in the world would Esther be so monumentally inspirational? Nothing in the film's prior goings-on indicate that's she's capable of such persuasion. Re the latter ineptitude: Joan's revenge on her wayward husband was, plot-wise, a major event that one would naturally anticipate seeing in real action. But no: the two drive away, then the film cuts to an unimportant character blandly relaying what happened to them...(At least, contrary to all narrative indications, we're not finally subjected to a last teary-eyed speech by Esther before the masses.)
(2) JOAN'S PERFORMANCE. I'm a big Joan-fan, but overall, I tend to dislike her in roles where she tries to act overly and unnaturally warm and ""good-eggish""; such efforts usually turn out rather smarmily, which seems to be the case here. (Other examples that come to mind are 1931's ""This Modern Age,"" '33's ""Today We Live,"" and '51's ""Goodbye My Fancy."") Throughout her career, which ranged from 1925 to 1970, she was, for instance, highly capable of playing a baddish girl with a heart of gold (""Flamingo Road"", ""Grand Hotel""), or a good girl on the outs with Society (""Possessed"" '32, ""Paid""), or a decent woman trying to survive (""Mildred Pierce"", ""Sudden Fear""), or an outright villainness (""Harriet Craig"", ""Queen Bee"")... But a Help-Meet for All of Humanity? NAH. She tends to tilt her head up and shut down emotionally, which isn't too meaningful for the audience.
Re Joan's assessment that this was her last ""really top picture"": I'd say this honor probably goes to ""Baby Jane"" ('62), which was truly Joan's last well-done picture, both script- and acting-wise (though I do appreciate '64's low-budget ""Strait-Jacket""). And prior to that, ""Autumn Leaves"" in '56.
""Esther,"" on the other hand, is just plain dull and/or dull-witted.",1067904000,8,3357,5.218518518518518
7868187,4,6304329016,"Esther Costello (Heather Sears) is a young girl playing with her friends in rural post World War II Ireland. She and her friends enter an abandoned home and in the basement discover a cache of live grenades. Not knowing the danger, they begin fighting over them and pull the pin out of one of the grenades. As Esther hears her mother above calling for her, the grenade goes off, setting off an explosion that kills her mother. Esther undergoes severe psychological trauma that renders her blind, deaf, and mute. She ends up living with an uncaring, slovenly grandmother in her impoverished rural hovel, dirty, uneducated, and uncared for.
Enter Margaret Landi, a wealthy American, who is touring Ireland in search of her Irish roots, when she comes upon a teenage Esther. Estranged from her scoundrel of a husband, Carlo (Rossano Brazzi), and childless, Maargaret is moved by the entreaties of the local parish priest to help Esther. Though at first resistant, she is finally moved by Esther herself into taking her with her. She now becomes to Esther, what Annie Sullivan was to Helen Keller, and under Margaret's care and ministrations Esther responds and thrives. A light bulb goes on in Esther's formerly dark and lonely world.
Esther's story and plight ultimately captures the heart of those who hear it, and a charitable foundation is established. This foundation becomes recognized world wide and is big business, making Margaret and Esther the functional equivalents of televangelists, such is the fervor that they create wherever they go. Moreover, the money comes pouring in. This causes Margaret's estranged husband, Carlo, to come back into Margaret's life and not for the better. Carlo is nothing more than a handsome, smooth talking hustler.
Carlo brings a business partner with him and finagles Margaret into letting them handle the business. Margaret, who is clearly overworked, turns over the reins of the foundation to him. Her husband and his partner end up swindling the foundation. By the time Margaret realizes what is going on, the damage is done. Carlo has also put the moves on the now nubile and lovely Esther and ends up sexually assaulting her. When Margaret discovers what Carlo did to Esther, it puts her over the top, and she takes matters into her own hand. With her world tumbling down around her, Margaret meets Carlo and ensures that neither she nor Esther will ever be hurt by Carlo again. In the interim, Esther discovers that every cloud does, indeed, have a silver lining.
This is a terrific film, which garnered a British Film Academy Award for Joan Crawford as Best Actress for 1957. Her portrayal of Margaret Landi is compelling and moving. Newcomer Heather Sears gives a wonderful performance as Esther Costello, a difficult role. She is able to silently convey to the viewer what she is feeling. Rossano Brazzi, as the dog of a husband, is on the money, and the entire supporting cast give strong performances, making this a film to see. Fans of Joan Crawford will enjoy this film, as will anyone who likes a well made, well acted, though somewhat schmaltzy, drama.",1007942400,14,3109,4.946462715105162
7868188,5,6304329016,"Portraying a wealthy woman looking for a purpose in her life, Joan Crawford beautifully acts her role in this one.  She finds lonely, dirty Esther Costello, a young girl blind, deaf, and mute from a mental shock  during the war.  With visions of Helen Keller, Joan unselfishly begins to  work with her.  At this point her ruthless, although handsome husband,  re-enters her life, hoping to cash in on the financial success the Esther  Costello funds have been bringing in to help other young people who have  suffered as Esther has done.  After a morbid rape scene, the unfaithful  husband has a just end, but unfortunately it takes Joan, too.  What a  movie!  It is fasinating to watch Joan work.  She herself said if she  deserved one Academy Award for Mildred Pierce, she deserved two for this  one.",948844800,16,802,4.744525547445256
