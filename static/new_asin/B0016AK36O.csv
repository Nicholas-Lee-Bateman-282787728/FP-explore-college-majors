8261893,5,B0016AK36O,No issues with either volume I have purchased. The seller was honest about the condition of the dvd's and the box they come in. Happy to have this collection finished.,1469836800,,167,4.6
8261894,4,B0016AK36O,"it wasn't the type of ending I would of expected. but it was a good ending. kuno proved that in this last season that he is still a complete knuckle head, nabiki  shows that no matter to situation she will always turn a profit. ranma  and akane STILL can't tell each other that they love them, but ranma comes close. and as for happosai he will forever be the women's underwear lover that we all come to know and love. for me episodes 24 and 25 are the kickers, do to the fact that we FINALLY meet ranma's mother and like any good son leaves her dreaming about what kind of man her son has become.",1372291200,,597,4.137931034482759
8261895,5,B0016AK36O,"Why both emotions?

Happy: I finally own and get to see the seventh season of this great anime series.
  I didn't get to see this season earlier in my life.

Sad:  Everyone feels a little bittersweetness when a favorite show/series comes
  an end.  I am glad it had an open ending which means anything could still
  happen.",1363046400,,323,4.508771929824562
8261896,5,B0016AK36O,"This show is a classic. It is amazing, and it is well worth the watch. You will love the characters, you won't be able to not. It's one of the shows that will sneak into your heart and make itself at home.",1359849600,,205,3.9047619047619047
8261897,4,B0016AK36O,"Product shipped very quickly and in good condition. Only complaint was all the disks were loose shaking around inside the box, luckily nothing was scratched",1293321600,,156,5.28
8261898,3,B0016AK36O,"Ranma 1/2 Ranma Forever is a DVD box set of the seventh season of Ranma 1/2.  This set contains a total of twenty-five episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains five episodes and the special features.

The special features menu contains seven options: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" ""Actor Profiles,"" ""Ranma 1/2 `Cast Wrap Party',"" and ""Ranma 1/2 `End of Ranma 1/2 Party'.""  As expected, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  The line art gallery contains twenty-five pages of model sketches of the characters and some of the locations that appear in this DVD box set.  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.

The Ranma 1/2 ""Cast Wrap Party"" is a roughly six minute feature that includes interviews with some of the English cast, intercut with footage from the English dub version of Ranma 1/2.  However, the audio quality on this features isn't very good; in fact, there's one voice actor interviewed in this piece that you really can't hear well enough to understand what she is saying.  The Ranma 1/2 ""End of Ranma 1/2 Party"" is another six minute feature from a fan party celebrating the end of the series.  This feature includes interviews with some of the cast, as well as some fans; this is also intercut with footage from the English dub version of Ranma 1/2.  On the one hand, I applaud Viz Media for going to the effort to include these final two special features on the set.  However, I'm disappointed by the quality of these two features, especially the audio quality for the ""Cast Wrap Party.""

Even with this set's flaws, it really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",1249344000,,1849,4.828571428571428
8261899,5,B0016AK36O,"While the final season of Ranma 1/2 doesn't end with the true story closure that the manga had, they chose well to finish things off the way they did. Ranma's mother is finally introduced - a story that happens relatively early in the manga counterpart - but it ends on a touching note of optimism, Ranma's newfound determination to lift his curse, Nodoka Saotome happy with the fleeting glimpse of her son. It's a bright new day, and the cast we've loved the last seven years are all doing fine.

The episodes in this season are up to the same standard and quality of the past few, the artwork has definitely taken a turn for the better. Lots of the same crazy comedy you'd expect, every character has at least one story revolving around them and you even see a few old faces you never thought would return.
That said, I'm secretly hoping they one day revive the series for another bout. There are enough unused stories in the manga to sustain an entire 8th season (or 9th if you count the excellent OAV collection) and, of course, the series never had its true ending.
Slayers made a triumphant return last year after a long period of time, I'd love to see more Ranma one day.",1236038400,4,1178,4.453703703703703
8261900,3,B0016AK36O,"The final season doesn't contain the ""true"" ending as shown in the final manga volume. In that volume, Ranma's mother accepts her son's and husband's curse. It would've been nice if the writers included this ending. I've read every manga volume, watched every episode as well as the two movies and the OAV series. So many stories in the manga have been left out of the anime. One story in particular is about Ryoga's new girlfriend near the end of the manga. She knows his secret and still loves him. I wished that the entire manga series was written into the anime (look at Dragonball/DBZ for example).I only wonder what Rumiko Takahashi has to say about all of this.",1218153600,,668,4.621848739495798
