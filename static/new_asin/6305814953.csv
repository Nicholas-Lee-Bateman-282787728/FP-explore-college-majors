7896810,4,6305814953,"The 1977 film ""MacArthur"" is well aware that there were two sides to the controversial military leader Douglas MacArthur, and you can almost see the makers of this film flipping a coin to decide which side Gregory Peck gets to show in the next scene. On the one hand there was the brilliant military strategist and leader who directed Allied forces in the Pacific against the Japanese in World War II and for the first half of the Koran War. On the other hand that was the vain and egotistical man who selected official photographs with as much care as he plained invasions and attacks. Most of the credit in this film goes to Peck's performance in making these two diverse sides fit together for the most part.

The contrast between the two is probably best captured in two scenes involving Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright (Sandy Kenyon), who was left behind in command of the Philippines when FDR ordered MacArthur to get to safety in Australia. Even though he promises MacArthur he ""will be here or I'll be dead,"" Wainwright is ultimately forced to surrender and MacArthur goes off the deep end, insisting that Wainwright has gone insane and heaping invective on the man's name. Later in the film, on the day the Japanese signed the articles of surrender on the U.S.S. ""Missouri,"" Wainwright arrives, a gaunt figure after years of captivity in a Japanese prison. MacArthur embraces Wainwright warmly, brushing away all apologies and assuring the man he can have his Corps back as soon as he says the word. MacArthur remains the same man, unconcerned by the obvious contradictions of his nature.

Director Joseph Sargent frames this biopic with MacArthur's famous speech to the cadets of West Point, where he extols the virtues of ""Duty,"" ""Honor,"" ""Country."" Beyond a brief look back at his early life and military career, the story of the film begins with the general and his besieged forces in the Philippines. But throughout the film we are supposed to hear those words ""Duty,"" ""Honor,"" ""Country"" resonating. MacArthur is forced to leave the Philippines, but he vows to return, and he does. The UN forces are almost forced off the Korean peninsula, but MacArthur retakes it all before the Chinese get involved. MacArthur is able to force FDR to go with his plans, but finds Harry Truman unwilling to go along, thereby ending a distinguished military career of over half-a-century.

Which sides comes out ahead? The ways Sargent tries to balance the two sides gets pretty interesting. Both Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) and Truman (Ed Flanders) have their pokes at MacArthur, while it is a pair of his Japanese adversaries who speak to his military ability (scenes that are reminiscent of the Germans doing the same thing in ""Patton""). The Presidents give the general credit for his military endeavors, but those accolades are buried beneath the verbal ripostes; on the political side the rebuttal comes from actual film footage of Republican Senators (e.g., Nixon of California) supporting MacArthur and blasting Truman. Even stranger, MacArthur's aides are forced to play it both ways. On the one hand they are doing everything they can for the general's public relations, but then there are also times when they basically roll their eyes at what is coming out of MacArthur's mouth.

In the end, MacArthur is not only redeemed by Peck's performance, but by having the final two scenes of the film be the famous pair of speeches MacArthur delivered when he returned to the United States. The first was the ""The Old Soldiers"" speech given to the Joint Session of Congress and the other the speech to the cadets. When you have a character who has been saying some pretty stupid things from time to time throughout the film and then allow him to reach such flights of oratorical elegance, it is hard not to end on his side of the ledger. ""MacArthur"" is not enough to allow anyone to make a reasoned judgment on the man and his career, but it should be enough to inspire those who are interested to go read some books that can provide you better evidence for really making up your mind.",1109548800,2,4088,4.835714285714285
7896811,5,6305814953,"No one in modern American history stirs as much controversy and disagreement as does General Douglas MacArthur. In this terrific movie Gregory Peck does a wonderful job accurately and flamboyantly portraying  the complex, brilliant, but vainglorious general so many Americans learned  to either love or hate. It is all here, from his ignominious (although  officially ordered) personal withdrawal from the Philippines by PT boat,  leaving his entrapped garrison behind to the rebuilding of American  presence in the south pacific, and the first tentative efforts to stem the  tide of Japanese aggression in New Guinea. MacArthur was a virtual dynamo,  and was instrumental in slowly but methodically turning the tide against  the Japanese, first by leap-frogging his way slowly up the coast of New  Guinea, and then by island hopping his way closer to a return to the  Philippines. By late 1944 he was ready to invade the Philippines, and did  so boldly and with a smashing success first in Leyte, and then eventually  retook all of the islands. Finally, he oversaw the signing of the  instruments of surrender in Tokyo Bay, and this terrifically staged and  filmed scene alone is worth the price of the video.
The movie is full of  action sequences and interesting insights, and although we don't learn much  new or original about ""Dugout Doug"" here, it is a fascinating personal  portrait as only an actor of Mr. Peck's reputation could have delivered of  one of America's greatest generals and most controversial historical  figures. I particularly enjoyed Ed Flanders' portrayal of feckless Harry  Truman. Indeed, the clashes between Truman and MacArthur over the strategy  in Korea are fairly accurately depicted, leaving this viewer both admiring  MacArthur's position based on his knowledge of the combat situaion as well  as his resolve not to appease the Chinese, but yet also understanding that  too much was at stake politically and strategically to be as aggressive and  as provocative as MacArthur tended to be.  This film, like ""Patton""  starring George C. Scott, provides the viewer with a couple of hours of  wonderful drama and a peek at one of history's most instrumental and  successful military leaders during his times at destiny's door. I really  enjoyed this movie, and suspect you will, too.",964828800,12,2315,5.1617250673854445
