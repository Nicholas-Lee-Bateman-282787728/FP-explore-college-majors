1353494,5,B00004U0FK,"""The Book of Stars"" is a work of art. Director Michael Miner  creates beauty and magic within the medium of a big city's mean streets,  and out of the lives and spirits of a few of the real and vulnerable people  who populate them: a disillusioned poet, a grievously ill teenager, a  recovering freedom fighter, an idealistic old professor, a sensitive  convict, and even an anonymous lost astronaut. Dope is involved, and  prostitution, and death, and heart, and need, and hope, and love - and a  fantastic scrapbook kept by a saint. The directing is tight. The visuals  are stunning. The music haunts. And the outstanding performances by Jena  Malone and Mary Stuart Masterson and the supporting cast of Karl Geary,  Delroy Lindo, and D.B. Sweeney are deeply affecting.
I highly recommend  ""The Book of Stars"" - one of the best movies I've ever seen.",968371200,13,852,4.8068965517241375
1353495,5,B00004U0FK,The previous review from Studio City describes the film perfectly; except that it's visuals and cinematography compliments the whole emotion of the  film. The emotion is visceral and so are the images. A beautiful film to  say the least.,967939200,2,237,5.051282051282051
1353496,5,B00004U0FK,"i was attracted by the imaginary scene and the ""sistership"" between Penny and Mary.  Jena Malone's performance as a mature little one  in this movie is excellent, definitely can moisture your eyes.  And for the  hear it's also a touching one- the ballad folk song at night, the music  companied with the prisoner's poems...etc., which connected every single  part of the movie and made it a complete one, a dream world.  So just let  yourself stuck in the sofa (or on the bed like me) and get your desert  eyeballs an oasis!  BTW Danile, i watched it accidentally on cinemax too!",966038400,3,579,4.643564356435643
1353497,5,B00004U0FK,"Accidentally I watched this movie on Cinemax, so I didn't start from the beginning. But I was attracted to it. The movie, or film, was fascinating.  I like watching stars, and Jena Malone gave me a whole new vision.",965779200,3,215,4.512820512820513

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something great!",1392681600,,352,4.072463768115942

7923353,4,B00004U0FK,This is an amazing look at the hard edge of life and a coming death. Great acting Mary Stuart-Masterson is at her intriguing best and a strong performance by Karl Geary. If you enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie or The Notebook then this DVD is for you.,1233273600,,247,4.391304347826087
7923354,5,B00004U0FK,"As I write this, I can go down to our DVD library and choose any of more than 3,500 movies dealing with or for children and teens.  But, I cannot think of any of them that is more of an emotional movie than this one!  It is truly a bittersweet story about a 16-year-old girl, Mary, dying of cystic fibrosis, whose junkie/prostitute older sister is her only relative after their parents died.  Two neighbors and a prisoner are also a part of the story; all of them have suffered some tragedy in their lives, and the story interweaves them together in such a way that there is a natural symbiosis.  Mary, with her book of dreams she calls her book of stars, is the link between them all, and she seems to be the only one who can see the good in their lives.

In a movie dealing with a dying teen, I would have liked to have seen some reference to God, their church's beliefs in Heaven, or at least some Spiritual awareness.  This is totally lacking, unless one considers a fantasy of spacemen among the stars counts as something spiritual.  While you probably should have your handkerchief close by as you watch the film, it also has a delightful, happy element as well.  This is a movie you'll probably need to watch several times to understand all the parts, but it is so good that if you like emotional movies, you won't mind watching it again.  I am grading it down to an 'A-' because of its failure to consider traditional religious beliefs; still, it is a movie you won't soon forget.",1232841600,,1488,4.401459854014599
7923355,5,B00004U0FK,"As the title of this review, indicates that is what this film illustates. It is told with an clarity and intensity that is more real than 'reality.' It is one the most beutiful works of magical realism I have ever seen. Mary Stuart Masterson is masterful and if Jena Malone is not the finest young actress in America, I don't know who possibly could be.",1171497600,2,353,4.446153846153846
7923356,5,B00004U0FK,"Bumped into this one at the library.  Wow!  The blockbusters and spectacles are fine, but it's little gems like this one that outdoes them all.  Jena Malone shines (no big surprise), Mary Stuart Masterson does a fine job.  They are well-supported by Delroy Lindo, Karl Geary and D.B. Sweeney.  The music is haunting - wish a soundtrack was available.  The art in Mary's (Jena Malone) book is a good match for the music and the free-verse poetry of Penny (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Mary.  In fact, this movie has inspired me to start writing poetry.  I enjoy action/adventure movies, dramas, and comedies, but movies like ""The Book of Stars"" linger on while the others fade.  Well worth at least one viewing (I lost count how many times I've watched it!)",1022630400,6,754,4.7384615384615385
7923357,5,B00004U0FK,"Fascinating movie that I happened to see on IFC or Cinemax. And this coming from a guy who thinks every movie doesn't have enough babes or guns.  Anyway, I was transfixed by the complicated relationships between these characters.  Everyone had some type of pain in their lives and needed someone else to heal them or give them hope - Mary needed her sister to take care of her and Kristjan as the only one to see her as more than a child, the professor needed the sisters to rescue as a respite from his lonely existance, the convict needed Penny's book of poetry and Mary's kind letters as a way to survive the harsh life of prison, and Kristjan needed to learn how to care again after the war in his home country.  And Penny, reluctant Penny, hides from reality and dulls her sense of her responsibility and unfortunate circumstances.  She of all requires the most help - the tragic character who is rescued by her sister Mary.  Mary is the focal point for the convict, Kristjan, and the professor and she inadvertently magnifies all their hopes and kindness to Penny.  That's what I assumed the sun symbolized, Mary shining her indomitable spirit onto Penny, the peripheral characters were the stars.  I'm probably reading too much into the symbolism.  Excellent performances by all, very moving picture, quiet, imaginative and most of all hopeful...
Another movie similar in its quest of surviving the inevitable is Sweet Jane, a gritty drama about an addict adopted by a terminally ill child and how they help each other with life and death.",1010448000,14,1546,4.742537313432836
7923358,2,B00004U0FK,"The characters are cliched, the plot is obvious but Karl Geary is gorgeous and a fine actor (as usual).",996624000,2,103,4.473684210526316
7923359,5,B00004U0FK,"If you don't need tissues long before the end of this story, you have no heart. I bought this DVD because it was one of the recommendations made to me by amazon, and because it starred Jena Malone. Mary (Malone) suffers with the terminal illness, Cystic Fibrosis, or ""sister fibrosis"" as she called it as when a small child. She lives with her elder sister, Penny, who is a lady of the night. The bond that exists between the sisters is the first heart warming aspect you experience with this film, when Mary snuggles up to her sister in bed, and makes her wake up by forcing open her eyes and then saying ""Oh good, you're awake"".
Then along comes Kristjan, a new neighbour in the adjoining apartment, a refugee from the war-torn Balkan region, whose first experience of Mary is getting a wet head as he stands outside because she over-waters a plant in the window box above. She is struck by him as he turns the event into a magical comedy, producing an umbrella in mock protection of himself, before then revealing the fact that the brolly has a large hole in it, through which he peers at her. When they meet again in a local store, and he accepts Mary's invitation to dinner with her and her sister, the chain of events are set.
Mary has a wonderful, dream like vision of life, which she portrays within the pages of a scrap book she calls her Book of Stars. Mary sees only beauty in the things around her, the stars, butterflies, flowers and plants, angels....  Her zest to experience as much as possible in the short life she has left is singled out when she admits to Kristjan that she isn't sad about her fate, and that she believes that exciting things are still going to happen to her, ""scandalous things"".
When out on a picnic, a role-play ensues between Mary and Kristjan, encouraged by Penny, where they again pretend to meet for a first time, at a Society ball. This is then swapped for a bus seat together. At the end of it Kristjan asks Mary to respond to a question. If he is to ask her out, then she must reply if his timing is too soon or too late. He asks her ""tomorrow ?"", to which Mary replies ""too late"".  It is at this point in the film where Mary's very fragile hold on life is magnified a thousand times over. Tomorrow is too late.
The celebration of Mary's 16th birthday inevitably occurs in a hospital bed. Kristjan remembers their role-play, and buys her a beautiful dress, ""for the Society Lady"". But with a collapsed lung, there is no hope that Mary will now leave the hospital alive. And Kristjan is also bearing the news that his family has now been traced, and that he will be leaving for his homeland. Despite this, Mary carries Kristjan along with her continued zest for life, telling him that his leaving is too bad, and that she was going to ask him out on a date as soon as she got out of hospital. He tells her that he would have accepted. She says she would have worn the dress. And then she remembers how he taught her to say ""I love you"" in his own language, and in a heart-wrenching moment she repeats those words to him, and he replies the same.
This movie has so many other elements to it besides the love story between Mary and Kristjan, and the extra-ordinary bond that exits between Mary and Penny. Watching it time and time again also reveals how Kristjan helps Penny to come to terms with Mary's condition. There is also the Professor, a friend of the girls, who helps them both to cope, providing romantic novels to Mary for her to read, taking her to her clinical appointments, and giving words of wisdom to Penny who doesn't want to hear them, but who fortunately does hear them before it is too late.  And the Prisoner, who writes to Penny, inspired by her book of poetry she wrote some time before, particularly a poem about Mary, which was helping him to cope with prison life until his release. Penny doesn't respond to his letters, but he only keeps writing because Mary does respond, pretending to be her sister.
The movie immerses you in a vision of life that sparkles and glows, but which always brings you back to earth again as Mary's condition worsens, and those close to her, Penny and the Professor, argue about her care.
In the night before her death, Mary finishes the last page of her book of stars, a moving portrayal of herself as a guardian angel looking down on Penny as she stands on the beach where both sisters played together as children.
In her death, Mary understands that her book of stars and lovely things will act as a reminder to her sister of what life is really about. For Penny, its very existence helps her to understand that her life has a future without Mary, a life full of hope.",996537600,14,4671,4.416473317865429
7923360,5,B00004U0FK,"I have never, ever seen a mvie like this. I had already planned to see this movie 4 days ahead, but still I missed the first 25 minutes. However, I am now searching where I can buy this movie in my country, The Netherlands.
About the movie itself: very good, great actig performances by all actresses/actors. After seeing this movie, I decided to look around on the internet some to find some more information about this terrible, horrible disease, CF. I have already found lots of information, and since I was already thinking about medicine, this may just be the disease I want to eliminate from the world. Now, I think this will be my primary mission in life.
YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE.",984182400,5,695,4.523809523809524
