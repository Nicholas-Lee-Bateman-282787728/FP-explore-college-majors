4526776,1,B005232A80,Transfer is HORRIBLE!!! And they still charge regular DVD prices for these pieces of junk. What a shame. This is a wonderful movie. BUT...beware of this DVD. I was so looking forward to this film. Instead it made my blood boil after viewing this copy. I guess the days are long gone when studios used to care how their releases looked. But why should they now when they can hammer them out and charge the same prices for crap!,1440892800,21,426,4.405063291139241
4526777,5,B005232A80,"I was very happy to receive this marvelous 1940's gem starring one of that decades' most vivacious leading ladies, the enticingly beautiful Paulette Goddard.  In the finest role of her career she is simply Miss PersonalityPlus, igniting every scene in both raucous comedy and moving romance. Any fans of lavish period costumers and social satires should grab this title for their home film library.  I'm so glad to own it at last!",1438992000,,430,4.958333333333333
4526778,1,B005232A80,"a great movie but a very poor picture, they have not restored this movie in any way which is a great shame for the money they sell this film for. My copy i got from spainwas much better so please universal give us a  good product in the future as i buy a lot of your films",1438732800,15,272,3.7719298245614037

4526780,5,B005232A80,I love viewing this hard to find classic gem.  Paulette Goddard and Ray Milland have great comedic chemistry in this movie.,1393113600,,123,4.857142857142857
4526781,5,B005232A80,"The movie is magnificent!  Do not purchase the movie from an independent seller (I purchased a copy that was fuzzy and could be a recording from a broadcast).  This movie is a predecessor of the musical ""My Fair Lady"" and is very entertaining.  The movie is well plotted, and the characters are vibrant.  An actor makes an appearance in both this movie and most of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies.  It is entertaining to see him.  Watch it!",1388707200,6,462,4.7125
4526782,5,B005232A80,"My favorite movie of all time.  Leisen was one of the best at directing women.  Goddard and Milland are in top form.  Some of the great character actors like Eric Blore appear.  Gorgeous black and white cinematography.  And, a wonderful storyline.  Tea and sugar, Lady Susan?  A must see!",1386201600,2,288,4.755102040816326
4526783,5,B005232A80,"I have adored this film since first seeing it years ago on TV----I taped it, and my tape is becoming a little, uh, snowy.  I hope it will become available on DVD again soon!  Please!!!",1374624000,3,184,4.228571428571429
4526784,5,B005232A80,"Magnificent treatment of the basic 'Cinderella' or My Fair Lady plot, only so much better than either of those.
Beautiful Paulette Goddard is plucked from being a 'guttersnipe,' by dashing Ray Milland who finds her sitting for painter Thomas Gainsborough, in his studio.
Living beyond his means & in debt, Milland's constant need for money causes Milland to train Kitty in how to become a Lady, with the help of his alcoholic aunt.
The story of how this is accomplished and of Kitty's subsequent rise in Royal circles of England, is so good -  you'll just have to see for yourself. The movie, sets, script and costumes are given the full studio treatment and you're gonna love it. I have to say the print I received was of extremely poor quality & had to be returned. This film should be available on quality DVDs &  in mass quantities. Although B & W, I like it almost as much as GWTW. sloanranger-Wattpad.",1352419200,10,907,4.627329192546584

4526790,2,B005232A80,"I first saw this film some 60 years ago and fell in love with it, but unfortunately over a period of time our tastes change and the film, being in black and white the costumes and interiors came over as very disappointing.  Never the less I was pleased to see it again and happily give it a two star rating.

4526794,1,B005232A80,"The  Film is great, been waiting for this for years, I received the UNIVERSAL VAULT  version and the quality of the transfer  is one of the poorest I have ever seen, it is worse than an old played out VHS tape, the focus is soft  to the extreme, the contrast is as poor as you can get, how UNIVERSAL have got the nerve to offer anything as bad as this for sale is beyond me. Be very wary of UNIVERSAL  vault MODs they can be very dodgy.",1442361600,14,436,3.9655172413793105

When shes captured, he sees she has natural beauty and has her pose for a portrait. His friend sees the potential in her to help him gain status in society and boost his career. He then trains her as Henry Higgins trained Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion. This is a standard romantic comedy/costume drama with good acting and an interesting story. Nothing extraordinary, except Paulette Goddard, but well worth watching.",1493337600,,539,5.067415730337078
