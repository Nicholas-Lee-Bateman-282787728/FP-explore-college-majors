8161370,4,B000LC3IOC,Kelli is always great.  I liked this one because I recently purchased the stability ball and was looking for a nice workout.,1367193600,,124,4.636363636363637
8161371,4,B000LC3IOC,"Keli Roberts is in my top 5 best instructors out there.  She is motivating, encouraging, tough and very knowledgeable.  She is the kind of personal trainer you'd love to have because she'd get results out of you.

This is another great workout from her, and this time it uses a stability ball to work your core and develop balancing skills.  Abs, spine and posture (how the workout got its name ASAP) is what this is all about and it looks easy, but you get a great workout.  I like the fact that you can do the whole dvd in one go, or pick an 8 minute pre-mixed routine.  Each routine has a focus on either balance/core, strength and strength/balance.  She is a terrific cuer and so you know in advance what's coming next and she tells you how each move will make you feel (so you get an idea as to whether you are doing it correctly or not).  All you need is the stability ball and you are set to go.  It's a little over a half hour so it's easy to fit into busy days, and I mix this up with aerobic workouts because there is none of that here.  I love this and it's a nice change to other toning workouts because using the ball is something different to do.  I highly recommend this.",1172188800,19,1186,4.180616740088106
