8036154,5,B0004Z305I,"You must grab this DVD (and the others in the same set) whenever and where ever you find it--they are quite hard to find now, and these episodes seem to have been repackaged in a way that is slightly less impressive (in partnership with a new distribution company).

Auto B Good - ""A Road Less Traveled"" contains episodes 13-18 of the series, this being the 3rd DVD in a 6-DVD set (the older, NON-""Special Edition"" set). These episodes need NOT be viewed in order, and this DVD may be viewed in isolation from the rest of the episodes available on the other DVD's of Auto B Good (but why you wouldn't want all of the episodes is beyond me!).

The 6 actual episodes included are:

FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES - Thankfulness - The talent show episode (where Johnny flies--with Professor's help!).
HEAVENLY EVENT - Generosity - The meteor shower episode.
SUNNY SIDE UP - Goodwill - The one-small-thought-can-change-the-course-of-events episode.
UP FROM THE DEPTHS - Joyfulness - The one where the Professor wants to quit inventing.
COOLER HEADS PREVAIL - Patience - The one where Johnny and Derek almost boil over at each other.
DIGGING FOR GOLD - Cooperation - The one where the massive snow drift keeps Izzy from the State of Good's Spelling Bee.

Noting some of the other reviews for this product are showing a bit of disappointment in the inclusion of a surfer-dude and a valley-girl character, along with the use of the word ""stupid"" in at least one episode, I have to note a few things.  One is that, though I am in no way having fun myself hearing these characters over and over again as my kids watch these videos time and again, they are new to my kids and simply add to the diversity and colorfulness of the characters.  And, these two characters are usually the ones where character flaws are most often found.  They are not characters often held up as the ones you would want to emulate; they are the ones who need to learn their lesson.  The use of the word ""stupid"" does not usually pass without issue; it is used by a character as part of the springboard for conflict necessary for story-telling.  Its use is realistic and ugly (for this show--because words like these are NOT used often in this series) and the consequences are dealt with.  Still, it is there, and so are the language issues. So if the presence of these is a deal-breaker, then you better pass.  But I don't think these are dealt with in a flip way, and if you can stomach it--or that type of thing is not on your radar anyway--then purchase away!  My young son has not called me ""dude"" or anything ""stupid"" to date, but everybody's different.

This was from the batch of the first 4 DVD's produced for this set, when the episodes were around 10 minutes long and you got 6 episodes per DVD--an hour of content--sometimes with some additional bonus material (for the 5th and 6th DVDs' in this set, the episodes are about 15 minutes each and you only got 3 episodes-about 40 minutes of content). The bonus material included ""deleted scenes"" or ""out-takes,"" sometimes different versions of entire episodes, etc. You could choose between 2.0 or 5.1 sound on this edition of Auto B Good DVD's (you have no choice on the newer, ""Special Edition"" ones--not sure what is provided, honestly).

All of the episodes were strung together in these first 4 DVD's of this older edition of Auto B Good by being introduced by a small (still 3D CGI) group of characters: a young boy and girl and their wacky inventor uncle-type character, who appeared to be ""telling stories,"" which were the actual episodes which then played. For some reason, they dropped this approach, and after the first 4 DVD's, so you only get the episodes themselves with none of these other characters book-ending the stories. In DVD's 5 and 6 of this set, the episodes themselves are slightly longer (but you only got 3 episodes, so it ended up being about 20 minutes less content per disc on those last 2 DVDs in this set). I miss the introductions by the non-car characters, personally, as they provided the younger viewer with a little focus for what the coming or previous episode's theme was, and served to help string together the few double-episode stories.

Most or all of my copies of the DVD's in this edition (meaning the NON-""Special Edition"" set) came with a set of 12 small stickers of the characters and an ""Operator's Manual"" which is a small, full-color brochure containing a short focus lesson on the character trait for each episode, with reference to an appropriate Bible verse.

The whole package is professionally produced, thoughtfully written, and lovingly animated in 3D CGI on par with anything out there (a little shy of the photo-realistic look of a movie like Cars (the Pixar Movie) but just as beautiful to look at--here they went for something only a bit more cartoonish and brashly colorful, which is perfect for the target audience of younger children). The characters are memorable and well-used to tell stories meant to inspire good character in young viewers. This, without being ""preachy""--I would say even less so than a show like Veggie Tales (which isn't preachy, really, either). Most of what plays on these DVD's after you hit PLAY contains no overtly Christian content, actually--especially in the later DVD's, where the episodes are not bookended by other characters who make comment on them. I would like more of this, myself, but apparently there has been a big push by the producers and/or distributors to get this show into the ""character education"" market for elementary schools, so this is what it ended up being. Honestly, it still is a fabulous show for youngsters even with little to no evangelical or overtly spiritual edge. Compare this to Pokemon or whatever garbage passes for afternoon and Saturday morning cartoons, and you'll be running to find more Auto B Good any day of the week.

My 4-year old son loves these, and he has been watching them over and over for well over a year now. When his cousins of ages 3 through 6 come over, they are all mesmerized. I love them for being beautiful to look at, devoid of inappropriate scenes and themes, instead developing positive values and virtues.

These episodes are now produced in ""Special Edition"" fashion, which includes 3 episodes per DVD, sometimes with music videos (contemporary Christian music set to scenes from an episode on the same DVD) and a ""bonus"" episode (you can apparently purchase them either way, but for the same price). They have not necessarily kept the same episodes bundled together on each DVD, and they have re-named at least one episode, making it hard to figure out which DVD you need to complete your collection if you started with these older editions. Still well worth buying if you have nothing, but they seem frustratingly--almost deviously--designed to require purchase of at least several DVD's with episodes you already own if you want to complete a collection you started with this first, slightly superior, edition. There are quite few episodes that were produced after this first edition was put out, so if you want to get your hands on all of the Auto B Good episodes, you'll end up buying a fair number of the ""Special Edition"" DVD's after all. These newer-edition DVD's do not come with bonus material of the likes the older versions came with, they do not include the ""Owner's Manual"" or other goodies like stickers, either. You get less episodes per DVD, so I believe buying all episodes via the ""Special Edition"" seems costlier, as well (not that I know that it is even possible to obtain all of the episodes in the ""Special Edition"" set). Honestly, I am quite disappointed they moved to this new marketing approach for the retail market. (MUCH more expensive versions of these DVD's are now available with teaching manuals in PDF form included, or as an ""Absent Parent"" edition with special material meant to be used where a child has a parent overseas in the Service--I applaud both of these editions, but all I want are the great packaging and episodes of the initial set!)

All of which is why, if you can get your hands on these older DVD's, especially for anything close to what you consider a good price, you should snap them up without hesitation!",1218672000,7,8241,4.746331236897275
8036155,3,B0004Z305I,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my three-year-old son, who loves cars, trains, and all moving vehicles these days.  We have watched it several times, and although my son and my five-year-old daughter seem to enjoy the stories on the disc, I regret having purchased it.  My husband and I are very particular about what our children watch and strive to purchase high-quality entertainment for our children that is also educational and inspiring.  Life is just too short for them to be whiling away the hours in front of the television, unless we feel that they are viewing something that is quite exceptional.

We have no complaints about the production quality or the moral teachings featured on ""A Road Less Traveled,"" but two of the main cars have (to our ears) pronounced and annoying ""valley girl"" and ""surfer dude"" voice and language characteristcs (e.g. overuse of words ""like,"" ""totally,"" ""dudes,"" etc.).  What was cute in several scenes in the feature film ""Finding Nemo"" (the Aussie surfer turtle) becomes tremendously grating over the course of the entire Auto B Good DVD, not to mention that these characters are simply poor speech models for our children.  I understand the desire on the part of the producers to differentiate the characters by using distinctive voice and language styles, but at some point the question should be asked as to whether characterizations that model proper language usage would work equally well in a film targeted toward young children.",1198713600,3,1481,5.0
8036156,5,B0004Z305I,"As someone who works directly in multimedia production, I found the quality to be first rate.  Great surround mixing, sharp graphics and motion.  The character voices are diverse and amusing.  The plots and story lessons are engaging and effective.  My four and a half year old son loves it!",1186876800,,291,4.877551020408164
8036157,4,B0004Z305I,"I love the Auto B Good shows for my sons. However, this one has a couple of shows that use the word, ""Stupid"". Needless to say, I was not happy when my 3 year old started using the word. This one sat on the shelf for a while. My 3 year old loves that the cars talk and it is well made. I do recommend the A B G videos.......just beware that they do use that word in a show or two. But, for the most part, it teaches honesty, integrity, and strong values.",1168387200,,454,3.8404255319148937
8036158,3,B0004Z305I,"Auto B Good seemed to be the first direct competitor to the hugely popular Vegie Tales audio/video series as both aspire to encourage positive Christian conduct (such as honesty, generosity, etc.). It has excellent graphics but, unlike its competitor, the Auto B Good series lacks the storytelling polish, creativity, and entertainment of Vegie Tales.  Though the automotive characters are somewhat cute and appealling, most of the episodes are mostly filled with lengthy dialogue covering predictable themes.  Naturally, I am aware that these are intended for a young audience, but my children found them somewhat tedious and uninspiring.",1100649600,2,639,5.577319587628866
8036159,5,B0004Z305I,"I'm sure someone had a merchandising dream before coming up with this concept - anyway this is a collection of thoughtful stories (6 of them) with talking cars as the main characters that cover themes like thankfulness, generosity, patience, (I'm forgetting a couple, but all positive personality/character traits), but rather than a yawn-fest which stories with these kind of themes could become, they instead come off with a good deal of charm.  I found myself smiling often while watching them.",1100217600,3,497,5.2125
8036160,5,B0004Z305I,"I just ordered these from the TV Commercials and my children absolutely loved it! It's like 'Davie and Goliath' meets 'Toy Story' but with sweet looking cars! My middle child constantly asks for the ""DVD Cars""... she can't get enough of them. I love the fact that there are six short stories on each DVD. We plan to get them all when they come out!",1096416000,3,348,4.369230769230769
