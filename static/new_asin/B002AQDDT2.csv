3890854,5,B002AQDDT2,"What a great series to allow my Little Princess to watch Godly examples of behavior and see grace played out as well. Have given several as birthday gifts to friends with 2-6 year old girls. (my boys even requested it a time or 2 when it was new!) Nice to have a DVD choice that is not full of sarcasm, violence or disrespect. Thank you - wish there were more!",1359676800,3,360,4.1571428571428575
3890855,5,B002AQDDT2,"This item was exact. Perfect for my little grandchild, just what I expected and with the price and fast shipping, I have nothing but graditude for the supplier and for Amazon. Thank you so much for helping make a child really happy. I have grown to depend on Amazon for most of my shopping and if I am ever unhappy with a purchase I know they will make it right.",1357430400,4,362,4.185714285714286
3890856,5,B002AQDDT2,I bought these dvds for my 2 daughters and they absolutely love them! The stories are very well written and have excellent topics that are pertinent to little girls.,1356048000,,165,4.724137931034483
3890857,5,B002AQDDT2,"I bought these for my daughter who is now 7 when she was 18 months old. I was so sick with my second pregnancy that all I could do was sit on the couch with her and watch movies or read. She has always loved these and I enjoy them too! I now have a second daughter who loves them too. I hope they make more of them. These are so cute and they teach little ones about God and good values. We have many mainstream kid videos, but I love that I never have to worry about them picking up on adult humor in these movies (and other Christian children shows) and they are not about falling in love and getting married! Not that falling in love and getting married is a bad thing, but I don't want it to be the main focus or goal for my girls. I want a relationship with the Lord to be first. I'm not depending on movies to teach my girls about God, the movies are just a nice little bonus.",1350432000,2,882,3.9329608938547485
3890858,4,B002AQDDT2,"We gave our 3 year old grand daughter this DVD for Christmas.  I have not seen it, but She loves it.  I was told it is more
like a ""reading"" than an animation.  If you are looking for a movie, check this out carefully, it may not be one.",1342915200,,237,3.795918367346939
3890859,5,B002AQDDT2,Gigi is perfect for girls from ages 0-10. She experiences things that all girls experience and somehow always has an upbeat and fun perspective. She always thinks the best of others and is forever trying to find a way to bless someone else. How refreshing.,1307145600,11,256,4.711111111111111
8360010,4,B002AQDDT2,"I think these are really cute.  My 5 year old enjoys them on occasion, but I would not say loves them.  She notices the coloring and how the characters that are drawn differs from what is shown on modern television shows now.  I think if that was updated she could show more interest.  The story lines are great though and overall I'm glad I bought them.",1471305600,,354,4.318181818181818
8360011,5,B002AQDDT2,My 6 year old daughter loves it!  She likes to reminder me she's God's little princess just like Gigi.,1457049600,,102,4.368421052631579
8360012,3,B002AQDDT2,The wig on GiGi is very unrealistic and overall poor quality. The sorry is excellent. My daughter enjoys watching it.,1427155200,,117,4.9
8360013,5,B002AQDDT2,Great DVD series.  Keeps my 4 1/2 year old captivated.  Great christian values cartoons.  I am sure this will be one kept in our library for years to come.  Looking forward to purchasing some of the books.,1424822400,,205,4.45945945945946
8360014,5,B002AQDDT2,A wonderful gift for a little girl,1414627200,,34,4.0
8360015,5,B002AQDDT2,"my children and I love Gigi, love that she is teaching them about Gods way. Tis makes a wonderful gift for all ages.",1389916800,,116,4.086956521739131
8360016,3,B002AQDDT2,"We really love the Gigi books.  I ordered this set of dvd's to put in my daughter's Easter basket and she likes it but it doesn't quite hold her attention like others.  She's 4 and she has a pretty good attention span.  (Actually better than most kids.)  The stories are really good but the animation is a little old fashioned maybe for her.  (Not for me, it seems fine but maybe because it looks like a video I would've watched when I was little.)  She may find it more interesting as she watches them more...I hope.",1366156800,5,517,4.333333333333333
8360017,5,B002AQDDT2,"My four year old started going princess and tea party crazy as I'm sure all little girls do. However, we wanted to help her realize that we are all God's princesses and princes which is so much more important. The stories are simple enough for her to relate to and has a little scripture refence at the end. She loves this series so much that she has asked to give it as gifts to her friends.",1365292800,,392,4.171052631578948
8360018,4,B002AQDDT2,I'm not sure what I was expecting so am not greatly impressed with it.  It's OK.  I'm the grandma so may not be into little girls interests as much as I used to be.,1364688000,,164,3.7941176470588234
8360019,5,B002AQDDT2,"Gigi's stories are great.  my little princess can totally identify with her.  i think maybe identifying with herself too much.  the stories were very interesting, my little 4 yo girl watch them over and over.  and her 9 yo brother would actually sit through and watch them with her AND enjoy the stories.  I find so many good things to talk to the kids about after watching them to instill good lessons in them in ways they can understand and take to heart.  Bravo, good buy.",1362873600,,475,4.465116279069767
