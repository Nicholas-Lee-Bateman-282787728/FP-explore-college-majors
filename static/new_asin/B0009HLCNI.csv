2290808,4,B0009HLCNI,"This review is plucked from a review-in-progress of the Mill Creek Dark Crimes Classic Features Collection. I've set out to do a short review of each of the 50 films within the set and post them individually before posting a single long compilation for the set itself. So without further ado, let's begin:

Film number one in the ""Dark Crimes"" collection is The Mandarin Mystery, a 1936 adaptation of an Ellery Queen murder mystery novel. The plot centers on young, amateur detective Ellery Queen (Eddie Quillan) trying to piece together the clues surrounding a stolen stamp and a double homicide.

The first thing that stands out about this film is the tone. I realize that the 1930s march to the beat of their own drum, but it really sends mixed signals when the first 10 minutes of your movie plays out like an overblown, rom-com meet-cute. Queen finds himself smitten with the beauty and charm of Miss Josephine Temple (Charlotte Henry), and much of the film focuses on his attempts to win her over. Queen is a walking one-liner generator, and the rest of the characters follow suit (particularly Queen's long-suffering father, the police investigator originally summoned to look into the case of the missing stamp).

Suffice it to say, this film is as much an oddball comedy as it is a murder mystery. Just about every line of dialog culminates in a quip. There's a particularly amusing exchange about midway through the movie in which Ellery Queen glibly makes requests about which penitentiary he would prefer to be incarcerated in. Nothing says sticking it to the man like requesting a stint at Sing Sing with a grin on your face and a bounce in your step. There's also a smattering of slapstick early on, and later a soundproof room is put to the test via WACKY SHENANIGANS.

The picture and sound quality is what you might expect from a collection of films that are extremely old and more than likely in the public domain. The film stock is trashed, there are dropped frames all over the place, and the dialog is muddy. But in a way this sort of adds a certain of-the-time charm to the whole thing.

The Mandarin Mystery isn't a bad little movie -- it runs 52 minutes, which is odd given the film's original run time was closer to 64 minutes -- but as the first film in a set titled ""Dark Crimes"", the tone is just bizarre. The mystery itself is only serviceable, but Ellery Queen and Miss Temple have a likeable rapport, and the humor still plays well when you consider that the film was shot 78 years ago. It's kind of a shame that there were no follow-up Queen films utilizing the same cast and tone. I'd have gladly watched more of them.",1411344000,3,2651,4.619957537154989
2290809,4,B0009HLCNI,"It's pretty good, and I'm willing to watch it again.  It's a good story line, one of a kind stamp gets stole, forgery, damsel is in distress. Eddie Quillan (Ellery Queen) is quirky and odd but is funny too. So it works out ok.",1407024000,,226,4.136363636363637
2290810,4,B0009HLCNI,"There's just something about a locked-room murder mystery that appeals to me, and that is exactly what lies at the heart of the 1936 Republic film Mandarin Mystery.  Well, not exactly, as the ""impenetrably locked room"" has two doors, one of which is clearly unlocked (although no one in the film seems to notice this obvious fact).  That's not the only odd thing about the film.  It's adapted from Ellery Queen's ""The Chinese Orange Mystery,"" but the story here is much different from the book.  Mandarin Mystery is as much a comedy as it is a mystery.  It's just one quip after another from most of the central characters, especially the character of Ellery Queen himself, who's basically just trying to make time with Josephine Temple (Charlotte Henry), the ""dame"" who has the stamp stolen and becomes the prime suspect for the murder of a counterfeiter in the aforementioned locked room.  All kinds of evidence point suspiciously at Temple, but young Ellery keeps covering up the young lady's suspicious activities from his father, Inspector Queen (Wade Boteler), and the two Queens basically engage in a battle of wits until the mystery is finally solved - which only takes place after a second murder.

The Chinese Mandarin is the world's most valuable postage stamp.  In what must have been an extremely slow news week, members of the New York press descend on Miss Temple and her unique stamp as soon as she arrives in town.  She's on her way to meet a buyer, Dr. Kirk (George Irving), but Ellery Queen latches on to her after accidentally hitting her in the face with a bouquet of flowers.  Now maybe it's just me, but if I were a woman, I don't think I would be carrying the world's most valuable stamp around in my purse.  It should really come as no surprise that the precious stamp is soon stolen.  Miss Temple runs up to see Dr. Kirk, but we see her turn around and go back downstairs - with the stamp - after entering the room adjacent to Dr. Kirk's Stamp Room.  When a dead body is then discovered in that locked room, it's only natural that Miss Temple would fall under a cloud of suspicion.  The fast-talking, love-smitten Ellery Queen has absolute faith in her innocence, however, and he makes haste to insinuate himself into his father's investigation.

The whole story is really just played for laughs.  It's impossible to take Eddie Quillan seriously as Ellery Queen, and the dialogue of the film gets more comedic with every passing moment.  The somewhat complicated solution to the whole mystery works, but it doesn't generate a whole lot of suspense along the way.  The real mystery here is the missing 9 minutes of what was originally a 63-minute film, as the only copies available top out at only 54 minutes.

Mandarin Mystery, despite its oddball comedic casting of Ellery Queen, does manage to be entertaining and quite witty in spots, and the mystery itself isn't all that bad, but serious Ellery Queen fans will no doubt come away from this flighty film shaking their heads and telling anyone who will listen that this movie tells quite a different story than the novel it was based on.",1135036800,23,3116,4.715867158671586

2290817,3,B0009HLCNI,"I like old mystery and crime dramas and have even read and enjoyed some Ellery Queen stories, but Queen misses too many obvious things in this one before reaching a clever conclusion.  If you can overlook the missed clues, Eddie Quillian does, for the most part, make a pretty good Ellery Queen.  There are moments in the movie that he reminds me of a young Henry Fonda and he made this movie before he appeared in THE GRAPES OF WRATH with Fonda.
The movie explanation for the error resulting in the rare Mandarin stamp is pretty funny.  Printers' errors resulting in upside down airplanes and such do occur, but this error is magnificent.
I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1457913600,2,711,4.582677165354331
2290818,3,B0009HLCNI,"Stamp, stamp, who's got the stamp?  In this brief mystery, it's difficult to tell just who has their hand on that darn stamp because it truly gets around.  The story involves the quick sale of a potentially valuable stamp.  To complicate matters, Eddie Quillan (as Ellery Queen), immediately latches his unwanted affections onto the owner of said stamp (Charlotte Henry as Josephine Temple).  She cannot shake him.  He is equally persistent and obnoxious.  Everything is a joke to this nitwit.  Soon, the stamp is stolen and the thief is caught dead to rights.  Literally, leaning up against a door deader than a doornail.  Naturally, Ellery Queen insinuates himself into the case, against his father's protests (Wade Boteler as Inspector Queen).  The smart aleck son manages to solve the crime through subterfuge and a lot of guesswork.  Practically everyone is a suspect including the hotel manager (the incomparable Franklin Pangborn).  Sadly, the movie is too often hijacked by Quillan whose flippant manner seems oddly out of place where murder and theft are concerned.  Still, it was entertaining enough to keep for future viewings.",1433548800,,1138,5.186813186813187
2290819,4,B0009HLCNI,"Fun old B/W movie that I enjoyed, but having the Ellery Queen set from 1975 staring Jim Hutton I found myself judging the movie by the 75 Ellery Queen and the 75 is far better. None the less this is a good watch.",1433462400,,212,3.953488372093023
2290820,2,B0009HLCNI,"The Mandarin Mystery, 1937 film

It begins in downtown New York city. There is news about the worlds most valuable stamp. A big ship arrives in the harbor. Two men arrive to escort Miss Temple, so too reporters. A young man arrives with a bouquet. He meets Miss Tempe by accident. The talk tells about the situation of this heiress. A man hides in Miss Temples room. She talks to Inspector Queens son on the telephone. Then that man takes something from her purse! Miss Temple discovers that item is missing and calls the hotel manager. Two detectives arrive. There is a dead man in the next room! The talk adds more humor. More police arrive to watch the rooms. Why was the victims coat put on backwards? Nobody heard a shot. Is that room soundproof?

Can Ellery Queen solve the murder? Miss Temple tells what happened. There is another suspect now. The men and women there will be searched by the police. But nothing was found. A picture is awry, what was behind it? They tell about the racket in counterfeit stamps. There is comic conflict and an overlooked clue. ]Note the two-button light switch.] A man hides in a dark room, then hits Ellery Queen. There is a die for counterfeiting stamps hidden in a chair. There is an arrest and more humor. Mr. Johnson is summoned to verify the authenticity of those stamps - they are counterfeit! Ellery suspects Bronson. Miss Kirk tells what she did. But there is a shot from the library! Miss Temple finds a pistol and gives it to Ellery.

Ellery gives advice to his detective father on solving the two murders. He explains why the jacket was put on backwards and the missing tangerine. Then how the door can be bolted from the inside! [You have to see this.] This doesnt make sense. People are gathered together in a room, the murderer is exposed and confesses. Can he get away? Not if there is an unexpected event.

I never read any of the Ellery Queen murder mysteries where a police detective father and his son solve murders. This echoes the Conan Doyle stories, but with more humor. This movie shows the popular culture of the 1930s. Is there too much humor for a murder mystery? Movies change novels to attract more customers. Humor is added to break any tension in the audience. Did you figure out the solution earlier? Is the expressions on the actors faces a clue? This is based on The Chinese Orange Mystery by Ellery Queen.",1430352000,,2381,4.569086651053865
8060894,4,B0009HLCNI,"There is a news announcement that soon Josephine Temple (Charlotte Henry) will be coming to this country to sell an extremely valuable stamp called the Mandarin (bet you thought it was an orange). At the dock Josephine shows off her stamp to anyone that asks to see it. The stamp is just loose in her purse and everyone knows it. Ellery (Eddie Quillan) accidentally introduces himself to her. She gets a counter offer from another collector but turns it down due to ethics. So a sneaky third party plans to pilfer the stamp. He ends up dead with his cote on backwards. Ellery points out the obvious; the stamp has a mandarin on it with his coat on backwards. Is this a clue?

As with most mysteries everyone had access to the body and no one could have retreated through a locked sound proof door. Will the most obvious suspect die before spilling the beans? Will Ellery get a date with the stamp owner or go to jail himself?

This is a fast paces story with only 52 minutes it has to pose the problem and hopefully the solution all while Ellery woos Josephine and out guesses his detective father Inspector Queen (Wade Boteler.) Can we keep up?",1505606400,15,1145,4.5

8060896,4,B0009HLCNI,"What a classic 30's whodunit.  I think that it has been cut in several spots which leads to continuity issues but such a quirky, funny movie.  I wish they still made them like this.",1484524800,,181,4.294117647058823
8060897,2,B0009HLCNI,"Cute, but it doesn't come close to the original Ellery Queen mystery.  The principal characters are way off - Inspector Queen had a far more gentlemanly demeanor, Ellery was not a wise guy...But not a bad little movie if you take away anything you know about the original written mystery.",1484352000,,288,4.76
8060898,1,B0009HLCNI,"Found it boring, too old and not enough content to hold onto.",1483315200,,61,4.166666666666667
8060899,5,B0009HLCNI,"This Ellery Queen murder mystery involves a very valuable stamp and a lovely lady who is selling it. The collector who is buying the stamp is a curmudgeon who doesn't approve of his niece's choice of men. He claims to be investing his nieces' estate in rare and valuable stamps, but after a man is found murdered in his library, counterfeit stamps are also found on display there. Hmmm. What is going on?

Ellery and Detective Queen, his dad, pit their wits against each other as they try to solve this crime. The lovely lady has her stamp stolen and Ellery takes a liking to her, protecting her from the police at every turn.

With twists and turns and comedic choreography, this film moves along at a good pace, entertaining the mind while challenging it with several mysteries. Who are the good guys and who are the bad?

Enjoy the fun while the plot plays out!",1481328000,,864,4.5256410256410255
