One thing you can enjoy is the cool gadgets on the motorcycles such as boosters and missile launchers. The character design of the biker group is really well done and better than the others. Chase scenes are where Wild 7 does justice with gun toting bad guys firing down streets. The dubbing is pretty much ok. The animation is a place where this show needs some improving. Grated, Wild 7 may not be everyones cup of tea and it may need a little time to find its target audiance, but overall, an ok anime with a few glitches. Rent it first.",983232000,,678,4.475806451612903
