8744499,4,B01995ZH2C,The only reason I'm giving four out of five is because it was not available in English. I don't mind subtitles but this one had very good action artwork and I had to go back to read the subtitles. Other than that I loved this anime.,1479254400,,232,4.065217391304348

8744501,3,B01995ZH2C,"Never seen it. Looks really interesting. Want to watch it, but it doesn't come with English unfortunately. If I learned japanese I would watch it. Until that happens I can only hope a dubbed comes out in the future. I'm sure I would give it more stars if I had actually watched it. (I know. I shouldn't be writing a review if I haven't watched it. Warning people that it's only in Japanese though.)
If I see a dubbed (or learn Japanese) in the future I'm sure I would give the show more stars. Probably five based on what I've read about the show.",1466208000,,547,4.269230769230769
8744502,5,B01995ZH2C,I enjoyed the anime very much and hope there is a second season.,1464998400,,64,4.0
8744503,5,B01995ZH2C,"I'm not going to summarize the show or give any spoilers.

The characters in the series are really unique, I love how dynamic the characters are. Finally, the male character in C3 isn't some weak pervert or an idiot. He actually HELPS and defends those he cares about. Fear, the girl on the cover, is very cool. She has a split personality, and is incredibly brutal - will always keep you on your toes.

Also - it's not right to label this under fanservice. Sure, there is some - but no actual nudity (meaning no nipples and such like No Game No Life) and most of the fanservice is very brief and spread far in-between. This is more Horror/Action with a side of Slice-of-Life, and fanservice lightly sprinkled on top. Ha.

Fans of The Future Diary will like this.

p.s. no english dub.",1464393600,4,785,4.468531468531468

8744505,4,B01995ZH2C,"C3- Cube x Cute x Curious. Fear in Cube is a cursed girl, an instrument of death and torture, and she is now in the company of Haruaki, a young man who is immune to curses. What she wants is to be free of her curse, and he wants to help her attain humanity. Together, with other cursed beings, they struggle to help each other find peace in an un-peaceful world, where some want to destroy the cursed, and others want to use them for their own ends.

Honestly, I don't even know how to describe this show, as it doesn't really fit in comparison to anything I have ever watched before. That being said, it is quirky, strange, creepy, somewhat graphic and has more than one scene that is quite disturbing. Quite frankly, it's not for everyone as there is a certain masochistic theme imbedded in the story line. Me, however, I really enjoyed it (Not the masochism itself which really is needed in order to fulfill the story) but, the way it plays into the story, since the whole point is the fact that Fear was originally a tool of the Marquis de Sade and others who used her as an instrument of torture and death. Artistically, it stands up and the music, while nothing spectacular, has a nice flavor, what I found to be most interesting, is that in the 12 episodes of the main story arc (I don't include OVA's) there is so little in the way of major character development, and yet the story still manages to move forward. What I mean is that there is a no real way to describe the subtly at which the characters change. Only when you look at the start and see the end result do you notice, which would suggest that the series is forgettable from the very beginning, however this is not the case. In this case, it actually makes for a really intriguing story. And since the plot line is simple, there are no real gaps left unfilled. The characters themselves are unique and fresh, even in their under developed state. It has a clean finish that still leaves enough of an opening for a second season, but, if there is none that is O.K. as well. All in all it is a nicely done, short series anime, that goes a little off the already overbeaten track. It is Haremesque, but not a Harem, it is Horror/Supernatural with a twist, it has Ecchi moments, but I would not classify it as such.... Take this for what you will.... I personally really enjoyed this series and will definitely watch it again in the future....",1459123200,12,2442,4.404867256637168
