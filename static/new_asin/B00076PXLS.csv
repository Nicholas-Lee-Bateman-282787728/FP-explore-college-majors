8129153,4,B00076PXLS,"Steve Guttenberg turns in a funny and touching performance as the real-life attorney, Harold Krents, who went full tilt after his dreams despite being blind from the age of nine. Based on his eponymous autobiography, TO RACE THE WIND follows Harold's often comic misadventures as he pursues his dreams of becoming an attorney, living a full and independent life, and finding true love. Krents actually attended Harvard and Oxford University, and eventually became a successful attorney, but not without running into a few obstacles along the way, such as his trials in law school, his sometimes frustrating efforts at dating, and his hilarious run-in with the draft board. The film is well acted, thanks to an excellent supporting cast that includes Barbara Barrie as Harold's mother and Mark Taylor and Randy Quaid as his college friends, among other talent. TO RACE THE WIND is lighthearted, sweet and inspirational, with just the right amounts of message, humor and romance.",1310342400,2,977,5.189873417721519
