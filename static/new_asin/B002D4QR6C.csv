The quality is comparable to VHS.  I don't know what I expected.  It was the easiest and quickest way for me to see Teknolust, and I'm a big fan of Secretary, so I bought it.  Needless to say I'll be buying the Blu-ray of Secretary for about $7, because this copy is practically unwatchable.",1388102400,,464,4.464285714285714
