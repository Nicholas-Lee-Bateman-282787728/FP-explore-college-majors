5539003,4,B00B04NJ26,I have been a skydiver most recently and sailed some when I was young. The White Squall film is a great story and well acted with great screen shots. Most of us males remember what is was like when we were first interested in girls. Terminal Velocity has everything to do with adrenaline and risk taking basically the story of my life.,1372809600,,335,4.419354838709677
5539004,4,B00B04NJ26,I got a good bargain with these two movies on one blu-ray.  Particularly like Jeff Bridges' earlier movies like White Squall.,1368144000,,125,4.9523809523809526

8560043,1,B00B04NJ26,Terminal Velocity wasn't bad and had some nice special effects. White Squall sucked. Don't pay more than $4.,1452470400,,108,5.055555555555555
8560044,5,B00B04NJ26,"Both films are quite good, Sheen's being more of a comical nature and the other being more serious.  I was so surprised to find that both films are terrific in BD picture and sound, Being on one disc, I had imagined they would be of less than stellar quality, but not so.  Anyone reading my reviews must know that I am a sound and sight freak, love the big screen and the surround sound.",1449964800,3,387,4.216216216216216
