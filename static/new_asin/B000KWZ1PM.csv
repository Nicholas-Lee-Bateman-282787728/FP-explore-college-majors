8366168,5,B000KWZ1PM,I got this DVD for a stocking stuffer for my 13 year old who loves basketball. Even though this is a bit old (I bought it in 2012) most of the player featured are still relevant and it is still great footage of these players. Lots of game footage and great interviews. Great background information for kids who are just getting into the NBA. Big hit!,1355529600,,350,4.318181818181818
8366169,5,B000KWZ1PM,This DVD was really good even tho I thought it should have been longer and shown more jumpshots instead of just layups and mainly dunks by lebron melo Wade. It has good special features as well. Overall I enjoyed the DVD,1269475200,,220,4.390243902439025
