8507829,5,B0049V35TY,"I own a number of pole dancing videos including Jamillas Art of Pole 3,4 5 as I am advanced and training to become a fully qualified beginner to advanced instructor. I am very exited about this video. There are four routines on it. Number one is for beginners, but as Jamilla puts it herself 'there are few challenges there!'. Jamilla teaches you how to dance, there is a lot of wonderful 'in between' bits you need to know if you want to look good on the pole. Routine 2 is for lower intermediate, also has very nice sexy moves and the combos of intermediate pole moves, quite easy to follow. You probably will take about 2 weeks depending on experience to perfect each routine, may be longer with 3 and 4, I have not attempted to perform themy yet. Routine 3 is again intermediate, but more challenging. Jamilla refers to her Art of Pole videos but you do not have to necessaryly own them if you are experienced pole dancer. I can definitely recommend this video and as I look forward to all new releases from Jamilla Deville.",1303948800,5,1028,4.473404255319149
