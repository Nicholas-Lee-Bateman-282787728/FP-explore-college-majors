Thank you.",1387411200,,172,4.0588235294117645

5890072,5,B00E4NGCDI,"Comparing this to the Gambon series, this series starring Cremer is a clear winner ... even with sub-titles. Let's face it they were written in French.",1384300800,2,151,4.846153846153846
5890073,5,B00E4NGCDI,"With episodes 49 through 54 in set 9, we come to the end of the finest French TV series depicting the investigations of fictional Commissaire Jules Maigret of the Paris Police Judiciaire.  As well, we come to the end of the acting career of Bruno Cremer, who played the role of Maigret throughout.  By the time that these episodes were filmed in 2004 and 2005, Cremer was already battling throat cancer.  Indeed, his illness had taken such a toll by this time that episode 54 had to be released with the track of someone else's voice.

This last fact makes episode 54 too painful for me to watch again.  However, several of the other episodes in set 9 are among my favorites in the entire series, and I especially treasure the fact that the stories covered in set 9 are those you are least likely to have read as English-language translations of Georges Simenon's novels. From a purely sociological point of view, the episode regarding an old lady's companion most fascinates me because it explicitly addresses the theme of social class distinctions in France.  Nearly all of the Maigret novels touch on this subject in one way or another, but in this instance the juge d'instruction goes so far as to lecture Maigret on the commissaire's inferior bourgeois background. In general, the episodes of set 9 are directed with more finesse and provide more interesting detail than a number of early episodes.  ""Seven Little Crosses"" is particularly notable in this regard as it focuses in part on the sometimes fractious interaction of inspectors at Maigret's Quai des Orfevres office and features a police chase as followed across a wall map of Paris located there.",1383696000,19,1661,4.827464788732394

5890075,5,B00E4NGCDI,I love Bruno Cremer.  The subtitles don't bother me and the stories are really different.  Great series.,1424390400,,104,5.0588235294117645

5890077,5,B00E4NGCDI,"I am giving Maigret: Set 9 five stars even though I haven't watched it yet.  This is the last set of the Maigret series with Bruno Cremer and I have watched series 1-8. Not one episode has disappointed me. The series is satisfying in so many ways, Bruno Cremer gives the character of Maigret a timelessness and reality, he can be charming, cranky, clever and funny.  A fully rounded character.",1408320000,,393,4.6

The problem with Mhz releases is the subtitles are large as far I can tell, and detracts from the viewing.

Wish the subtitles could be resizeable if not removeable.

Rather buy releases from other producers that don't have these negatives.

Aspect is 1.73, quality of video is a bit grainy/hazy.",1402963200,,450,6.842105263157895
5890079,4,B00E4NGCDI,"I really like the character of Maigret--he is so good at his detecting one murder
after another in a very low key manner but he never misses after much intrigue
definitely worth a purchase and also I love the on location in Paris or Belgium
making it all the better--there are 2 Maigret one is subtitled which is this one
and the other actor playing Maigret is not sub-titled both are excellent in the part.",1395619200,,407,4.44
5890080,5,B00E4NGCDI,"A much needed version of Georges Simenon in the vernacular, so to speak. Subtitles are a little odd but then you'll be speaking French by the end anyway so who needs 'em?",1394323200,,170,4.34375
5890081,5,B00E4NGCDI,"For the real Maigret, I highly recommend the versions starring the actor Bruno Cremer. Outstanding casting and location work. This is also the most extensive series of the Simenon Maigret stories.",1390694400,2,196,5.354838709677419
5890082,5,B00E4NGCDI,Set nine includes the final six episodes of this outstanding series of Maigret mysteries.  Appropriately enough the last disc is set on Christmas eve and is an appropriate farewell.,1389052800,,181,5.241379310344827
5890083,5,B00E4NGCDI,"We have all the Maigret series.  A MUST HAVE.., #9--- We love his subtle, soft spoken,and seemingly naive approach to solving a perplexing mystery. Sadly ,all great things come to an end and he is irreplaceable.  Since his passing(08/07/2010) we feel that in all probability a  #10 or beyond will not be forthcoming.  We re-watch and treasure the ones we have because there is always something new to find in the rewind.

8600989,5,B00E4NGCDI,"The last 6 of the 54 MAIGRET stories with BRUNO CREMER as MAIGRET.Having watched the whole series,i must say that it's generally excellent and worth buying. All the stories are set in the fifties which doesn't really matter even if we know that some novels are from previous decades when SIMENON wrote them. I just wished that they had done all the stories including LE CHIEN JAUNE.In the last story L'TOILE DU NORD,BRUNO's voice had to be dubbed because he was too sick. There are many MAIGRET on the market now but stick with CREMER or JEAN RICHARD who did them before from 1967 to 1991.",1489622400,,589,4.566037735849057
