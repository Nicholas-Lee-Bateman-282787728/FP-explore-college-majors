7869057,4,6304372507,"WEE WEE MONSIEUR (1938)- Has some funny moments. The Stooges dressed up as Santas makes for a good laugh. I think every comedy team has made a film about the foreign legion. Curly has some great lines, especially dressed as Santa. After Moe slaps him, ""Just for that, no toys"".
PARDON MY CLUTCH (1948)- A pretty good short. Shemp is always funny when he's sick (see also SCRAMBLED BRAINS). There's a great scene where their tire rolls into a garage and the Stooges fight a mechanic, who thinks it's his tire, for it.
FIDDLERS THREE (1948)- The best of these three. Vernon Dent is very funny as a king. The Stooges are great when they're back in time. This short is great, and worth the price of this collection.
This is a nice collection. I would give it a higher rating if the quality didn't come out so dark.",1017878400,2,810,4.442953020134228
7869058,2,6304372507,"WEE WEE MONSIEUR (1938) - An okay short, although nothing special. The Stooges are living in France, and after escaping their crabby landlord (Harry Semels) whom they owe months of rent to, they end up joining the Foreign Legion. An pretty funny short, but could've been better.
PARDON MY CLUTCH (1948) - An okay short, although this is just too steady, and doesn't match Edward Bernds' usual manic, fast-paced shorts. There should've been some scenes with them camping - they never get one mile away from their house before the short's even over. Although Emil Sitka as the looney at the end was hilarious.
FIDDLERS THREE (1947) - Somewhat copies off of Edward Bernds' SQUAREHEADS OF THE ROUND TABLE, which was made exactly before this short, and was more creative and funnier. Here, most of the supporting players repeat their roles from SQUAREHEADS, and this was really made just to take advantage of that castle set from the movie THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST that Columbia had left over for a while. The nursery rhymes scenes are especially awkward and unrelated to the plot.
Farily mediocre tape.",994377600,,1103,4.903743315508021
7869059,5,6304372507,"The three Stooges episodes on this tape ""Pardon My Clutch"", ""Wee Wee Monsoir"" & ""Fiddler's Three""  are among three of my favorite Stooges episodes. In ""Fiddler's Three"" Larry  shows off his talents as a violinist, while Moe & Shemp  ""inadvertantly"" mess him up. In ""Wee Wee . . ."", the  three guys (this time with Curly) find themselves in the French Forign  Legion while fleeing this guy they ""poked too much fun at"" only  to find out that their commander is the guy they were JUST poking fun at.  All around good fun.",960768000,,519,4.516129032258065
