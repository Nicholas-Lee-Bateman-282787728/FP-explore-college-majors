5348905,1,B009LEL0GO,I own tons of Bigfoot dvds.  This is among the worst.  The trailer for another movie at the beginning was as offensive as offensive gets and it had nothing to do with bigfoot; just violence towards women.  The plot was dumb.  The effects were dumb.  The acting was dumb.  The ending was dumb.  Get the picture?,1362268800,4,310,4.428571428571429
5348906,3,B009LEL0GO,Just another crazy Bigfoot movie. There has been no proof that Bigfoot is a killer. Hollywood just can't make a good Bigfoot movie.,1360540800,2,131,4.739130434782608
5348907,4,B009LEL0GO,"Stars: Reb Brown, Sherrie Rose, Frank Stallone and Leilani Sarelle.

This David Prior - directed effort is really good monster flick,There was a prior thought to go straight to television or edited with an eye for commercial insertion ?

The old tv adage about `Showing The Bear Early...' or however it went,May apply here,The creative side OR producers want you to see WHAT FRIGHTENS you and then cut to results of mayhem.

Besides DAVID PRIOR making a director's comeback,He has REB BROWN acting like the kind of sherriff we fondly recall,SHERRY ROSE being the Lois Lane-ish pal and FRANK STALLONE as a classic heavy.

The monster is almost as brutal as a human monster,DAVID CAMPBELL,Who has alot of screen time and deserves it.

TED PRIOR  is a consummate actor,Not seen much since late '90s and has a good guy bent, Except this go round.

LEILANI SARELLE has a story arch,That's right there is a story to this monster hunt from Midnight Releasing.",1354320000,6,952,4.839506172839506
5348908,5,B009LEL0GO,"Wonderful old school fear fest. Starts out as a typical bigfoot attack on the unsuspecting, but finishes with quite the unexpected twist. Strong cast with plenty of surprises. Especially loved ""Cooter"" the typical town drunk that should have been taken much more serious. You B cult fans have a real gem here. Don't miss it.",1350172800,7,324,4.909090909090909
5348919,1,B009LEL0GO,"How this movie even got 2 stars from anyone is beyond me. The plot is barely there. You never find out why these creatures are killing anyone. They have like different story lines and all are very minimal. You have one guy who is this like jerk, tough guy on some sort of survival class that hardly knows anything about survival but can kill with one punch. The hunter turns out to be some black ops/ spec op dude who hires complete morons to help him. Of course the deputy makes a very poor attempt at showing cleavage. The acting is awful. The monster effects are okay as long as they are not in the light or really edited. I could going on but I am sure you get the point.",1503532800,,675,4.1603053435114505

5348921,4,B009LEL0GO,"Don't bother watching this if you are expecting anything other than that. This has everything a 1970s drive in movie should have: You got your exposed breasts in the first scene, every stereotype movie character ever invented--the big scary monster, beer drinking oversexed teenagers, city folk in the woods, small town sheriffs in over their heads, woman of danger, bar drunk, and psycho ex military special forces officer--with one well known name appearing in one scene at the end, cheesy practical effects, bad green screen driving scenes, and plenty of grunting and screaming to mask the grunts and screams of the people at the drive in watching the movie(use your imagination). I deducted one star because the final scene used CG instead of the ""guy in a suit"" trope, but the rest of the movie is exactly what I remember and loved about those drive in movie classics.",1502928000,,873,4.905405405405405
5348922,4,B009LEL0GO,"NIGHT CLAWS begins w/ two amorous young people, in the back seat of a car. RIIIPP! SHHREDD!! TEARRR!!! A hairy horror from the forest quickly turns them into human salsa! The next day, the police sift through the various body parts, looking for clues. Sheriff Joe Kelly (Reb Brown- SSSSSSS!) and his deputy, Roberta Glickman (Sherrie Rose- TALES FROM THE CRYPT- DEMON KNIGHT) are stumped. Meanwhile, a trio of hunters are on the trail of the creature, and a group on a survival training hike, enter the picture. Soon, Professor Sarah Evans (Leilani Sarelle- NEON MANIACS) joins the sheriff. She's been sent in by the government to investigate. Who will find / or be found by the beast first? Wooosh! Aaaggh!! The survival instructor and a hiker just found out, the hard way! Zzissh! Another survivor fails to survive! This Big Foot isn't just deadly, it's fast! Uh-oh! The local youths have decided to have a big beer bash in the woods! Will anyone be around, to be hungover in the morning? Not-so-shockingly, death and mayhem ensue. As killer Yeti movies go, NC is one of the better ones. It's low-low budget is well spent. The title monster, though not the most terrifying, is serviceable enough, and its gushy attacks will thrill the gorehundts! The twist near the end is trumpeted a bit too soon, but still works. Frank Stallone makes a cameo appearance. Worth a late night watch or two...",1502582400,,1393,4.784232365145228

5348996,3,B009LEL0GO,"""Night Claws"" is yet another in a long line of bigfoot movies that are laughable for all the wrong reasons. Viewed from the vantage point of a fan of campy horror, this film has its entertaining moments, though anyone who wants to see a genuinely good film should obviously steer clear if they've read the plot summary. The acting is deliciously poor, with Frank Stallone (as Mr. Testi, a double entendre name if ever there was one) as clearly the best actor present. Unfortunately despite his top billing, Frank doesn't appear until 75 minutes into the film. (The film is 86 minutes long.) Most of the rest of the screen time is chewed up by Reb Brown (who you may remember from the classic MST3K episode ""Space Mutiny"") as Sheriff Joe and the truly dreadful Leilani Sarelle as the manipulative Professor Sarah Evans. Her performance pained me, but in her defense her dialogue and character motivations didn't give her much to work with. Also of note is Ted Prior as the totally unhinged Charlie Parker, a character which brought wholly distracting and unneeded subplots to the film.

The film opens with incredibly hokey foot trauma (don't ask) and rapidly shifts gears to an idiotic survival camping expedition with five characters (all of whom seem to hate each other) in the woods. The expedition starts with a fistfight and the interpersonal conflict gets more ludicrous from there. The puzzler is this: why are any of them even there when nobody wants to do survival camping? Never mind that, there's a competing subplot about a big festival of great economic importance to the small town, and the sheriff who wants to stop it for safety reasons. (I wonder if the filmmakers ever saw ""Jaws."") Dr. Evans forces herself into the middle of an ongoing bigfoot wrangling investigation, though the creepiest character is the stuttering coroner who tells her she's ""a professor with such soft hands!""

The professor knows a lot about foul smelling hair (I am not making this up) and thinks it might be bigfoot, when the coroner reveals a plaster cast of an absolutely gigantic footprint that previously seemed irrelevant. (Really!?!) As the survival school contingent gets into deep trouble (with Charlie going completely bonkers while his wife endures the harshness in a director's chair) some bigfoot poachers are on a secret mission, all of which is tied together by subject matter expert Cooter, who is predictably drunk. After yet another pointless subplot about a bunch of teenagers having an ill-advised keg party in the woods, all the subplots converge in a little shack where there is actually one completely unexpected twist which I will not reveal. I am pretty good at predicting plotlines in films of this nature, but I didn't see this one coming, so kudos for that. Finally Stallone shows up to finalize the plot with a straight razor, and (Surprise!) it turns out there's yet another subplot about covert operations in Nicaragua to be dispensed with before the credits can roll.

There are a couple of extra features on the DVD including a very comprehensive and lengthy ""Making of"" feature which was more interesting than much of the film itself. Obviously this is a low budget horror thriller, and takes a definite old school approach to special effects and plot development. In spite of numerous problems with the film including some really subpar acting and issues with the script and direction, ""Night Claws"" is a film that I found enjoyable when viewed as a piece of cinematic cheese that is keyed more to promoting unintended laughter than genuine horror, and as such it's recommended to fans of B-movies and 1970's monster movies.",1366502400,8,3652,4.925324675324675

8542855,3,B009LEL0GO,"I like creature features, most are horrible, bad acting, bad special effects, horrible plot, and the ""monster"" is not very effective, but if it's over the top (ex most of the SyFy channel movies), I'll like it.  I kind of liked this film and kind of didn't, I'm more on the ""didn't side"".  This film killed a major character that I liked, and although it made sense, the death reduced my enjoyment of the film.  The plot was okay, but the actions and behavior of the characters on the survival retreat was so reprehensible and/or stupid I actually cheered their deaths.  It was because of the revenge twist that I gave the movie 3 stars, that was unexpected and put a smile on my face.  I also liked, that the ""monster"" wasn't killed off, and it wasn't alone.

Overall Night Claws is okay, it's not great, but if you like bad B movies about a well known mythological creature of the Pacific Northwest, this movie is okay, but only if it's free to watch.",1505692800,,953,4.448275862068965
