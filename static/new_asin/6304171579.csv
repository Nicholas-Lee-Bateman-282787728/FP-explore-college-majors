3511875,3,6304171579,"This video has some funny moments for the kiddos to enjoy, but everything is from several decades ago. Perhaps the funniest part for adults is seeing the once popular hairstlyes and clothing!",1475884800,,191,5.0
3511876,1,6304171579,Shouldn't even give it one star. Very stupid,1475798400,,44,4.625

3511896,1,6304171579,I couldn't watch the whole thing. This was horrendous. I guess animal cruelty was funny back then when this thing was made.,1461110400,,123,4.636363636363637

3511899,5,6304171579,Video brilliance. Everything about it was so good and amazing. It made my loling the entire time. 10/10,1458259200,,103,4.777777777777778
3511900,1,6304171579,"Very old footage. I like seeing bloopers but this is, to me, borderline animal abuse. Nothing funny about it.",1458086400,,109,4.7894736842105265

3511905,1,6304171579,Really?  you even had to ask? Too bas we cannot give less than 1 star we endured almost 4 minutes before moving on,1454025600,,114,3.9565217391304346
3511906,1,6304171579,Just awful... not even my 4 year old enjoyed it.,1453852800,,48,3.9
3511907,1,6304171579,This is what life was like before the internet if you're a hillbilly. Probably the worst thing I've ever seen. There are no funny moments just some appalling animal cruelty and a lot of horse racing. It looks like it was made in 1980...yet it was only released in 2000! The fact that this exists is the only thing that made me laugh.,1451520000,3,333,4.301587301587301
3511908,1,6304171579,I usually like these but this wasn't worth my time and I stopped it before the end.,1449014400,,83,3.9411764705882355

3511911,4,6304171579,My 2yo loved this,1446940800,,17,3.5
3511912,1,6304171579,"This was horribly outdated. The music was awful, a person consuming live animals is neither funny nor a blooper, and just in general, there just wasn't very many funny moments in this. Glad it was free with my ""Prime"" membership. Even at that, I wish I could get my time wasted watching this back.",1446422400,5,297,4.518518518518518
8287406,1,6304171579,WTF,1508803200,,3,3.0
8287407,1,6304171579,Not a good show for children - fairly violent and shows people being seriously injured. Not a fan,1502236800,,97,4.444444444444445
8287408,1,6304171579,Terrible. People getting hurt. Animals getting hurt for laughs. T%his needs to be removed!!,1491696000,,91,5.571428571428571
8287409,1,6304171579,"Very few real bloopers and very few funny moments.  Mostly idiotic people using animals cruelly or stupidly and even risking the safety of children.  I find nothing funny about bull riding, bull fighting or jockeys and horses crashing -- all dangerous cringe-worthy moments.  Although this is very dated with incredibly annoying music, I'm afraid we haven't progressed much socially.  ""Funny"" seems to have mutated into watching people in danger or getting hurt.",1490400000,,462,5.375
8287410,5,6304171579,Grandkids loved it.,1485129600,,19,5.666666666666667
8287411,1,6304171579,"Horrible, totally in poor taste.",1483315200,,32,5.6
8287412,1,6304171579,"The first few minutes you get the idea of this ""show"". Basically animal abuse (like circus elephants & bears performing, eating/throwing live animals and riding baby hippos!) however given the music & video, I assumed it was from a VERY long time ago so I just kept watching. After the credits the year that came up was 2000. Yeah it's free with Amazon Prime however Amazon shouldn't have this up in the first place.",1483228800,,416,4.635135135135135
8287413,2,6304171579,Not as funny as I hoped. I gave it 2 stars because I love animals.,1482624000,,66,3.466666666666667
8287414,3,6304171579,thought it would be something my grandson would like to watch - he wasn't interested at all,1479254400,,91,4.411764705882353
8287415,5,6304171579,"I have to watch this every week,as I sleep over with my Grandchildren every Sat. They LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! Some parts are Animals knocking over adults,or adults getting a nip on the butt from a horse( we don't laugh at that) Most are crazy races,bugs,frogs,hamsters,worms,you name it,silly stuff!!! It's good clean,silly fun and the kids love it! You will get some laughs too!!",1477958400,,376,4.890625
