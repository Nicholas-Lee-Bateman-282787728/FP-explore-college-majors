8047932,5,B0007L86EY,"Urusei Yatsura was the first of what is probably known as Rumiko Takahashi's ""big three"" titles (the other two being Maison Ikkoku  and Ranma 1/2), but in my opinion it is, all in all, her best work to date.  It is a wonderful blend of romantic comedy, low comedy, wacky screwball  comedy, and even drama.  What is infused in Takahashi's story with the  television series is a deeply mystical atmospheric presence that director  Mamoru Oshii loves to inflect in nearly all of his works (Oshii also  directed such films as Palabor and Ghost in the Shell).  If there is a  downside to the animated series, it is that Urusei Yatsura does not strike  out on the best of footing early on, but as it settles in once the main  cast of characters are presented, it is consistent in its excellence.  Of  all the anime series that are out there, this is certainly my all-time  favorite.",966470400,,876,4.567741935483871
