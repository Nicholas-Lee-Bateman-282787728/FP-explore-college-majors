8125536,5,B000FQIRWM,"This is a great family watch..children and adults will get quicky attached to the characters, my daughter especially loves little Michelle.

Although this was a US programme, my daughter loves it and if you are able to view Region 1 DVDs, this is definitely a series to put on your wish list. Enjoy",1179100800,,298,4.622641509433962
8125537,5,B000FQIRWM,"I bought Full House Seasons 1-4 for my 8 year old daughter.  She loves them!  The story lines give her something she can relate to, and are done with humor she can understand and get a good chuckle out of. My 6 year old daughter can also relate. It teaches kids good life lessons. Little Michelle is soooo cute. It's a good family oriented show that the whole family can sit down and enjoy together.  I'd highly recommend Full House to anyone looking for something for the whole family to watch.  Can't wait to get the rest of the series.",1168732800,,538,4.35
