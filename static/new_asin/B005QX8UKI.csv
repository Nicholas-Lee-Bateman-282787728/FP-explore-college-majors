8483917,4,B005QX8UKI,"Amy was drunk in this dvd, but if you are a BIG Amy Winehouse fan (such as I), it doesn't matter!!  There's waaayyyy more entertainment on this dvd than ""Amy Winehouse: Faded To Black, 1983-2011"" (lousy dvd).  On here, her voice is very hoarse, at one point during the song: ""Love Is A Losing Game,"" she begins to cry, she falls and drops the microphone during ""Wake Up Alone,"" What else can I say, except......if you are a HUGE A.W. fan, and you don't mind her performing on stage drunk, then this dvd is for you. :)",1337299200,,517,4.319587628865979
