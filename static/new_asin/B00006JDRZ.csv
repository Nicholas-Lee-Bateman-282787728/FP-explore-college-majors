The movies are a funny spoof of spy movies with amazing action and truly one of a kind gadgets . The series also has a famous villian in every installment , in Mad mission 2 it is the clint eastwood character from the good ,the bad  ,the ugly (or at least a lookalike) . In mad mission 3 it is a sean connery lookalike as james bond although Peter Graves (the real one) appears as his mission impossible character . In Mad mission 4 it is the german villian  from Raiders Of The Lost Ark ( the one whose hand was burnt by the medallion and who suffers a similar fate in this movie). These movies are for kids and adults alike and especially for fans of spys and gadgets . I am buying this collection as soon as it becomes available.",1031788800,13,881,3.9717514124293785

7970271,3,B00006JDRZ,"I guess it's okay for an alternate version of the first four films in the Aces Go Places series, which is the original title of this series by the way. Why  Anchor Bay didn't provide the original HK versions of the four films plus the fifth and final one is beyond me.

Instead you have the first four movies presented in a rather heavily edited international version which is probably only interesting because of how much alternate footage shows up in the 3rd and 4th movies compared to the HK versions.  The first Mad Mission movie originally ran 93 minutes, this version on this set only runs 83 minutes long. No extra footage was added into this version to make it unique, so it's merely a heavily edited version of the original HK cut. The English dub is funny though, dubbed by the same people who usually dubbed Italian Exploitation movies in the early 80s with Edward Mannix as Karl Maka being the big standout.

The second one is also heavily edited from the original language cut, the version on the HK box set runs 102 minutes long, this version runs 85 or 86. The difference is that this version seems to have exclusive alternate footage presented in it which gives Clint Eastwood impersonator Joe Dimmick more to say or do apparently. The cuts seem to be apparently shot footage for the original version that got deleted and probably just got shoved into the International market version for appeal purposes.

The third movie is really different in the International version, it's almost completely devoid of large chunks of the original sometimes, added in are longer bits of Peter Graves who was no more than a co-star in this movie really. The additional bits with Peter Graves are interesting, and I don't really know why the HK version deleted them or got rid of them.  The international version again runs way shorter than the HK version which clocks in at 95 minutes in it's original version, the version in the box set is only a scant 81 minutes. And it seems a half or a third of that is footage of Peter Graves they added for International appeal that they either A. shot after the fact or B. had deleted from the original version.

Finally the fourth movie is the only one of these that isn't available separately from the box set and is not quite as  edited as the others, considering the original version was the shortest movie in the series at 88 minutes. The biggest thing about this version on the Anchor Bay set is the alternate longer opening to the movie that takes place in Australia and sets up the events in the movie better than the HK version. If only the HK version had kept this longer opening. Other tiny deletions occur throughout the International cut, but it's not huge chunks of footage usually missing like the 3rd one.

In short, this is a pretty fun, exciting action-comedy film series in any version regardless. But the Anchor Bay set has to be criticized for not being able to get the rights to the full HK cuts of all the these movies.

By the way, there was a fifth movie of these released in 1989. Apparently a International version of that was released too, but it's not included here in the box set. A further shame on you to Anchor Bay.

The fifth movie had the late and tragic cantopop singer Leslie Cheung of A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, The Bride with White Hair, Farewell My Concubine, and Wong Kar Wai's Days of Being Wild.

The Killer and City on Fire star Danny Lee made a cameo in the movie along with City of Fire theme singer Maria Cordero.

It's presence makes this Collection incomplete and merely ok, it's already a box set of only compromised International versions that are only slightly better than the Miramax Jackie Chan cuts they paraded around on DVD.",1462838400,4,3724,4.565217391304348

7970274,5,B00006JDRZ,"Meet a series that mixes: James Bond characters, with Hong Kong action/stunts and finishes of with Pink Panther type of goofy-fun.  This high octane James Bond Asian spoof from Hong Kong was my older brother's and mine favorite foreign comedy-action series during our tween years.
This series comes to you with 4 parts.  More were eventually made...most of them in the 1980's.  Each Mad Mission deals with a different James Bond/Mad Max/Clint Eastwood types of characters, were they usually play the bad guys.  The trio that gets pulled into each action is a small time crook with a thing for electronic gadgets (think inspector Gadget or Q from James Bond films).  Another character is a bald and comical inspector that goes by the name Kody Jack (think Kojak meets Pink Panther inspector) and his wife who also happens to work for police.  The three always get themselves involuntarily pulled into international heists involving diamonds, jewels, money, people, and sometimes world destructive devices...
The film feature a lot of stunts involving cars, robotics, acrobatics, martial arts, explosives, and chases...all of which still make a great impression even though they have been filmed 30 or more years ago.",1421539200,,1215,5.173469387755102
7970275,4,B00006JDRZ,Mad mission is to spy movies what airplane is to suspense movies. It's Austin Powers before Austin Powers but with the ultra campy straight faced Hong Kong action flick excess! One of my old and dear favorites :D,1421366400,,212,4.605263157894737

7970278,4,B00006JDRZ,"One day, I got the itch. The itch to buy a box set of films I have never heard of. I enjoy Hong Kong films so I decided to give the Mad Mission collection a shot. I can tell you it's not money wasted.

The box set contains the first four films in the Mad Mission series (Sadly the fifth film Mad Mission V: The Taracatta Hit is not present) with Mad Mission 4: You Never Die Twice being exclusive to this box set.

Apparently these films are better known in Asia as Aces Go Places and are extremely popular over there (should be since they made 5 films). These films are an interesting mish-mash of genre's. First of all they are action films with amazing (but sometimes too staged) stunts. Second they are comedies with slapstick. Third they are spy spoofs making multiple references to James Bond and Mission: Impossible. These make for an incredibly fun time.

The main characters of the film is a bumbling bald headed cop that makes friends with a high class jewel thief. All the main characters are present throughout the films.

Out of all the films, I found the first film to be the strongest (as usual with film series). It just mixed the action and comedy perfectly. The second film is more of the same. The third film (directed by Tsui Hark, famous for his Once Upon a Time in China epics with Jet Li) takes a little of a nose dive as it just gets a little too goofy. Fans of James Bond will get a kick out of this entry though as it does have cameos by Jaws of The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker and Oddjob of Goldfinger. The fourth film does the complete opposite as famed Hong Kong director Ringo Lam takes the series in a dark, serious direction.

Anchor Bay does a great job at transferring the discs into 16x9 widescreen but sadly the discs lack special features (only trailers to speak of). The box itself is also cheap cardboard and the covers to the movies look like cheap photo shop renditions. The films are also only offered in their dubbed forms so people wanting subtitles are sadly out of luck. The only other problem is that the set doesn't come with Mad Mission V. Still the box set is well worth it but sadly is out-of-print but still can be obtained at rather low prices.

On a side note I found it funny how all the sequels use the number in the title differently. Mad Mission Part 2, Mad Mission Part III, Mad Mission 4, and Mad Mission V. This just further proves on tongue-in-cheek the films series is.",1241913600,4,2435,4.352422907488987
