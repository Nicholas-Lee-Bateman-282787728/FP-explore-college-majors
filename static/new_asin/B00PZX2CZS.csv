8689892,4,B00PZX2CZS,"No different than the previous collections, WWE wants to put this collection out before the end of the year so matches from the Survivor Series & T.L.C. events are not included.  As a side note, there isn't a Blu-Ray version due to the low sales of the previous editions & this is only available internationally due to all of the PPV's throughout the year being available on the WWE Network.

Matches Include:
Daniel Bryan vs. Bray Wyatt - The Wyatt Family was kicked out of ringside during the early moments which Bryan took full advantage of hurting Bray's knee & coming after him with an aerial assault both in & outside of the ring along with just a ruthless assault on that bad leg with strikes & stomps & twist including using the ring ropes before Bray fought back using his own body as a weapon with his weight advantage & focusing on the head & neck area keeping Bryan grounded as both men traded momentum catching each other & countering their signature moves & submissions. This was built as a fight & definitely came off as one to the point where I had to agree with J.B.L. later in the show, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show.""
Royal Rumble

The Shield vs. The Wyatt Family - Both teams had the same strategy in the beginning in that they isolated one member of the group working him over in their corner with their teammates making quick tags & having no problem taking their shots in on the apron with members of each team delivering offense that we haven't seen from them previously such as Luke Harper's dropkick & suicide dive along with Seth Rollings series of aerial offense that made the commentators compare him to Spiderman before things eventually did break down in the all out brawl between all six men that went not just in & outside of the ring but throughout the crowd as well that resulted in participants in the match being taken out one by one allowing the numbers game to take effect. This turned out to be the intense fight you was expecting with Jerry Lawler describing it best saying ""what a battle"" with the crowd being hot for this with duel chants for both teams & ""This Is Awesome!"" before they touched along with this match causing one of the funniest Twitter trends in WWE history.
Elimination Chamber
[The Destruction Of The Shield]

Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus vs. Christian vs. Cesaro - While the rules & structure for this Elimination Chamber match was the same, this was the first time since the creation of the match that there was only one World Championship in the WWE meaning that this was set to be the final chance for these men to get into a World Title match at WrestleMania. Various highlights include who started out the match & their very physical interaction, Daniel Bryan being a one armed man throughout the contest, bodies being tossed into various parts of the chamber from the chain wall to grate floor including going through the pod on more than once occasion, one man using another as a weapon against another superstar, one period where everyone hitting anything that moved, Cesaro's showcase of power, the reaction from himself & the crowd when Randy Orton discovered he was a marked man by everyone in the chamber, and more than one non-participant making their presence known. This was a fun match from start to finish.

Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would advance to the triple threat main event for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while it should be noted that Stephanie McMahon not only introduced Triple H but also was in his corner for the match. Bryan came into this match with his shoulder heavily taped from the attack weeks earlier which Triple H targeted right away while Bryan was able to repeatably ground Triple H with takedowns along with offense such as the running DDT off the apron & top rope somersault that not only hurt Triple H but himself as well allowing Triple H to continue to work over the arm using the environment on the outside along with various strikes & submissions as both men continued to trade momentum either using the same strategy such as suplexes or finding counters & reversals to other signature trademark offense. While it's unusual to see Triple H in an opening match position, it lead to one of the best opening matches in WrestleMania history as both men played off each other very well.
WrestleMania XXX

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista vs. Daniel Bryan - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.
WrestleMania XXX
[Daniel Bryan: Just Say YES!]

WeeLC Match: El Torito vs. Hornswoggle - I'll try to avoid all of the usual puns & jokes about the obvious during this review as this match just had so many highlights such as 3MB & Los Matadores getting involved & taking their own share of hard hits & bad landings due to their opposition & even at one point their own partner, both men using their own special tables & ladders & chairs, someone at one point having a fear a heights, and the most hysterical commentary I've heard in a long time thanks to J.B.Elf & Micro Cole & Jerry Smaller. This was exactly what it was designed to be...entertaining.
Extreme Rules Pre-Show

Intercontinental Champion Big E vs. Bad News Barrett - Big E started out showcasing his power with moves like the shoulderblock takedown before Barrett was able to use Big E's momentum against him more than once to get an advantage while keeping him grounded on the mat to take away his power advantage as both men traded momentum delivering some physical offense such as a big overhead release suplex, a Cactus Jack elbow off the apron to the floor, and a spear through the ropes. A really good match here with the interesting twist of who the crowd decided to support throughout the match.
Extreme Rules

The Shield vs. Evolution - This started out as a brawl between all six men before things settled down with Evolution dominated grounding one man with their power offense & illegal double & triple teaming in their corner while The Shield took back control with each member using their strengths such as Ambrose's brawling & Rollings aerial assault & Reigns power along with double & triple team tactics of own including using a specific submission maneuver just to play mind games before things really got out of control with the action spilling onto the outside with men fighting on & running across announce tables into the crowd with one man taking one hell of a ""leap of faith."" You can tell going into this match that it was going to be a war & it didn't disappoint one bit.
Extreme Rules

United States Champion Sheamus vs. Cesaro - J.B.L. predicted on commentary that this match was going to get physical right from the start & it did as soon as the bell rang with both men giving & receiving strong strikes such as Cesaro's various european uppercuts while Sheamus beat on his chest more times in the ropes than he usually does as both men traded momentum showing their strengths such as a superplex from the top rope after dead lifting his opponent off the apron or catching their opponent in mid-air or countering their signature moves with one of their own. This was a really good opening match that was exactly what Michael Cole said in the beginning, ""this is going to be a physical match.""
Payback

Last Man Standing: John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt - Bray had his followers Luke Harper & Erick Rowan at ringside with him as usual only for Cena to counter that with Jimmy & Jey Uso in his corner as well as Cena was able to get a shot in himself only for Bray to either counter or shrug it off & stay in control in the opening moments hitting big moves of his own such as the big splash in corner or one arm chokeslam before both men were able to execute big vintage moves with each man delievering as much as they were receiving such as chairshots & using the steel steps including one shot to the face to Wyatt that you had to see to believe as both men continued to fight both in & around the ringside area hitting their signature moves on the floor with the brawl continuing all the way to the production area with more than just the two ""legal"" participants having their bodies thrown through objects all around the arena. This is one of those matches where if you can get past the end result then this was a really big back & forth brawl with great spots between all six men involved.
Payback

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Jack Swagger vs. Seth Rollins - It should be noted that Bad News Barrett was injured earlier in the week eliminating him from this match as this match was full of various highlights including Ambrose staying true to his word targeting Rollins right away fighting into the timekeepers area, the unique way Kofi caught himself falling off the ladder, ladder used as a weapon, superstars sacrificing themselves to hurt the other, one man getting taken out due to injury only to return later, one man backdropped onto a scaffold ladder, a chair coming into play, signature moves executed using the ladder, and ""there's always a Plan B."" This was one of those ladder matches that had tons of hard work & crazy spots where everyone has having their moment to shine with my opinion being Jack Swagger being the M.V.P. of the match getting without a doubt his strongest singles performance in almost a year.
Money In The Bank
[The Destruction Of The Shield]

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Tag Team Champions Usos vs. Wyatt Family - The Wyatts were able to get the first string of momentum when they were able to knock one of the Usos off balance & keep him grounded heavily working over the head before the Usos were able to start to using their momentum against them & going ""Uso Crazy"" with their aerial assault onto both members in & outside of the ring along with the Wyatt's showing some aerial ability of their own as both men traded momentum with both teams either countering each other's or delivering the same offense against each other with each time coming closer to winning the match after each pin attempt to the point where you saw the disbelief on their faces after the near fall and sequences of hitting hitting one big move after another. J.B.L. said it best, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show"" as this was an unbelievable high quality tag team encounter between both teams.
Battleground

Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal - Bad News Barrett made it clear that he had some ""bad news"" to give to the winner before the match as the various highlights include everyone targeting who they felt was the biggest threat, Dolph Ziggler's heavy amount of close calls, Kofi Kingston continuing his highlight reel of avoiding elimination, the strength of Cesaro, an ""Undertaker/Maven"" moment in regards to the most surprising elimination of the match, Sheamus hard fight to unify his U.S. Title, and when it got down to the ""final"" two.
Battleground

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Paige - Paige came into this match celebrating her 22nd birthday as you knew where this was going in the opening seconds where an attempted handshake resulted in the hand being bitten & hair (or weave) pulled out by the roots as the women took the fight to the outside bouncing heads off announce tables & bodies thrown into the barricade & more hair pulled out as the girls picked up the intensity with various kicks & knees to their faces, one girl being shoved off the top rope, and one impactful counter to a move that had put other divas down. Both divas put a lot into his match action & storywise with the short time they had.
SummerSlam

Flag Match: Jack Swagger vs. Rusev - The winner of this match would have their flag raised & national anthem played after the match as Jack Swagger came out with the color guard from the Ft. Irwin military base with one man deciding to attack before the bell only for it to backfire with him heavily showing the effects of his injury throughout the contest to the point where he was having a hard time standing up only to even the odds attacking a previous injury on his opponent working over the ribs but kept hurting himself with the kicks & stomps to his opponent & even having to modify his signature move while his opponent unleashed a series of impactful moves including various suplexes. Both men really took it to each other here & told a great story here in regards to working over a body part.
SummerSlam

Lumberjack Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Dean dominated early punishing & torturing Rollins while taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside tossing Seth to them more than once before Seth attempted to use the lumberjacks the same way only for Dean to react differently having no issues fighting back with the lumberjacks as both men traded momentum in the ring before the action went to the outside with both men fighting the lumberjacks to either get to or away from their opponent with the action spilling out throughout the crowd with the lumberjacks eventually having to physically carry to men back to the ring with the action just being unable to be contained between the two legal men in the match. J.B.L. pretty much said it best, ""this was the wildest most chaotic lumberjack match in history.""
SummerSlam
[The Destruction Of The Shield]

Tag Team Champions The Usos vs. Goldust & Stardust - Jey came into this match with a bad leg that had been injured & attacked by the Rhodes for weeks leading into the match as the Usos took control early with some double teaming to the point where it took a distraction from the referee for the Rhodes to regain the advantage making frequent tags & focusing on one member of the opposition to the point where when he was able to start getting some offense on one man that his partner was able to cut him off right away while continuing to take advantage of distractions by the referee as both teams traded momentum with high impact offense & both teams flying onto each other while The Usos attempted to the Rhodes a taste of their own medicine from previous weeks. A very good athletic back & forth tag team match.
Night Of Champions

Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.
Night Of Champions
[The Road is Jericho: Epic Stories & Rare Matches from Y2J]

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena - WWE did another good video package that caught my attention before this match but in this case was a bell to bell breakdown of the numbers involved in their previous SummerSlam match. Cena attempted to give Brock a taste of his own medicine from SummerSlam in the opening minute while Brock heavily focused on the midsection using the same strategy from SummerSlam with various suplexes along with using his trademark kimura armlock submission stopping Cena dead in his tracks whenever he started to gain momentum only for Cena to ""never give up"" to the point where he was able to get some hard blows in to the point where Brock was bleeding from the nose as both men did go back & forth hitting their impactful moves along with sequences of countering or powering out their opponents. This was definitely a more competitive match than SummerSlam with the only downfall being the finish...depending on how you want to look at it.
Night Of Champions

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Cesaro - Both men started out with some grounded grappling early with Cesaro getting the early advantage including delivering a big move we haven't seen from him recently as he continued to attack with more aggression as time went on with strikes & submissions to the point where he hurt his own arm executing a power move which Dolph capitalized on himself using a series of submission moves himself with both men trading momentum using one big signature move after another resulting in a fun athletic opening match with the only downfall being that the match stipulation don't being necessary for how the match actually played out.
Hell In A Cell

Hell In A Cell Match: John Cena vs. Randy Orton - The winner would get a future title shot against WWE Champion Brock Lesnar while it should be noted that technically this is the first ever rematch in the history of Hell In A Cell, Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman was on the PPV panel, and there was a funny sign that WWE camera caught & stayed on a sign for a few seconds saying ""Enjoy Cena vs. Orton #121."" Both men began trading fist right away taking the fight to the outside before one man was able to gain the advantage using the ringside environment to his advantage such as the cell & steps along with using a chair to various parts of the body remaining dominate stopping his opponent dead in his tracks whenever he attempted to gain momentum including one move that ended one person's career in a previous Cell match along with continuing to use weapons to his advantage & having unique counters from his opponents offense before his opponent was able to fight back using the weapons himself along with using counters & delivering his signature moves on more than one occasion. This was the best Cena/Orton match in close to a year since their T.L.C. match as the Cell & weapons definitely added to the match but Cena was heavily on defense for a majority of the match instead of it being more competitive.
Hell In A Cell

Now I know that there isn't enough room to get every single quality match from the year but some of the choices were very questionable for this being a ""Best Of"" as certain matches were picked in favor of some that were better quality or more significant (21-1...enough said) but we still got some of the best encounters from the year so overall this is no different than the previous years in that this is a collection for those who those who have enjoyed WWE this year but obviously are unable to watch/collect most of the PPV's.",1439251200,,19606,4.60343347639485
