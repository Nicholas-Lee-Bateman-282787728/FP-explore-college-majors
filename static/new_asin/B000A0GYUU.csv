2346067,5,B000A0GYUU,"Loved it! Although the producers changed the storyline in one important aspect. The original book was better but if you have not read and loved the book it possibly does not matter. The BBC used to do this sort of adaptation beautifully and using the original castle in Italy did add to the pleasure.
All the acting is superb. In the 1990s the actors knew how to deliver believable performances and did not have to rely on editing. Will buy copies for my friends. Be careful of world video sectors though as my copy was a PAL and would not work in the NTSC section. Might be wise to buy the NTSC section that works anywhere.
Great buy and one of my favourite DVDs. Everyone should have an Enchanted April. I sound like a paid advertisement. I'm not.",1517529600,,749,4.434782608695652

2346176,5,B000A0GYUU,"This used to be my favorite rainy day film. The subtle beauty and promises of true love of oneself and others.... I had a fascination for each character and each for a very different reason. I must admit however, I liked it much better when I did not know who Polly Walker was. I recently binged on Rome and until she started talking I did not realize this was the same person. It's like seeing Candace Bergen in Murphy Brown and then seeing her in an Earlier film.... quite distracting.  Ah well, I'll get over it. Beautiful film.",1506124800,,531,4.418367346938775

2346178,5,B000A0GYUU,"Over the years some people become more fun and interesting. On the other hand some become staunch and passionless. Seems that Lottie (Josie Lawrence) picked the latter to marry. One day at her club she sees an advertisement to rent an Italian villa for a month she shows this to a friend Rose (Miranda Richardson) and offers to share the cost.

This leads to a great adventure with the beautiful Italian villa ""San Salvatore.""

The story is well written and could have made a good play as it has all the elements of understanding and misunderstanding. Even some explosive scenes.

There all the characters, looking for a retreat from life, find each other again; for some the first time. You will find yourself wanting it to go on.",1504742400,,731,4.6953125
2346179,5,B000A0GYUU,"I first saw this movie in a theater.  It was breathtaking.  I watched EA a few more time before it was discontinued.

I used the messages from the movie as examples of gaining happiness.  I chose to take responsibility for loving instead of bemoaning my fate.  By following this, I felt in control.  This movie hunted me for decades, a constant reminder of love and friendship.

Since then, I eventually married and was able to make our marriage a happy one, even through difficult times.  We are happily married for 21 years so far.  We are looking forward to many more years to come.

For me, ENCHNTED APRIL is a life-changing movie.

Can someone tell me the quality of streaming this movie?  Does it come with special feature?  Is it movie screen size?  The visual impact is not there when they crop the sides for the 1st morning after arrival.  So I love to have a hd movie version.",1504569600,,886,4.484276729559748

Now I've re-watched it and re-found the beauty, the magic, the nice characters all combined in a compelling plot but there is not quite as much meat as I remembered.

I love Elizabeth Von Arnim's books........upon which this movie is based.
She was so far ahead of her time and wrote wonderfully rich stories with enormous wit .
If you have not read her books I highly recommend finding one !

Her first book Elizabeth's German Garden is an absolute delight.",1491868800,,328,4.377049180327869

2346279,5,B000A0GYUU,"One of my favorite movies. It's such a sweet story, where not a lot happens, but you feel good at the end. I like that the actors are mostly unknown (except Alfred Molina), and they all do a wonderful job. I love the character Lottie, whose positivity becomes infectious to the other characters. Lovely story, reminds me of an E.M. Forster novel/movie. I had a hankering to watch it again the other day, and I love the instant gratification that Amazon Video provides!",1488067200,,468,4.650602409638554
2346280,1,B000A0GYUU,Love this movie but the DVD received was such bad quality I couldn't watch it. Didn't watch it immediately upon receipt so it's now past the return date.

2346316,4,B000A0GYUU,"The winner of three Academy Award nominations, one for best supporting actress, this film is nice, even enchanting, but simplistic. I felt that it had a great beginning with great possibilities, but then petered out. It is about four English women who are dissatisfied with life and feel that they can rejuvenate themselves by going and vacationing in an Italian house by the ocean for a month. Two of the women have a bad marriage. They love their husbands, but their husbands ignore them, and one husband likes another woman. One of the four ladies is elderly with no friends who is only kept alive by recalling her acquaintances who are now dead. She tries to get sympathy by walking with a cane she doesnt need. The fourth is a beautiful socialite who is tired of being sought after because of her beauty and money. She is the other woman who one of the husbands likes.
All works out fine for the ladies, but the film does not explain why things change for them other than to hint that the place is enchanted. One can place a dead limb or a dead piece of wood in its ground and it will grow roots and become a huge tree.
The acting is very good and there are several times in the film, especially in the beginning where the film is funny.",1485734400,,1242,4.404347826086957

2346320,5,B000A0GYUU,"I love this movie.  It is so well cast.  Miranda Richardson, Josie Lawrence, Joan Plowright, and Polly Walker, play English ladies remarkably different in their characters and who decide to rent a castle in Italy with Wysteria  together for a couple of weeks.  They do not know each other beforehand and the story depicts their experience of sharing such a serene location to solve their individual troubles.  Alfred Molina, Michael Kitchen and Jim Broadbent playing the male leads.
The film is beautifully photographed on Italys scenic coast in a gorgeous setting pretty well promising romance. This is a feel good movie - one which will make the saddest heart feel soothed and that love is just around the corner waiting where least expected.",1483747200,,744,5.016260162601626
2346341,1,B000A0GYUU,"I didn't make it through this movie. The characters are all obnoxious, the acting is terrible, and nothing much happened after 40 minutes. I had no interest in seeing how this ended.",1483488000,,182,4.71875

2346371,5,B000A0GYUU,"This is one of those movies I watch again and again. The cast is phenomenal -- Miranda Richardson, Josie Lawrence, Polly Walker, and Joan Plowright are a perfect mix of personalities attempting to share a villa in Italy for a month; four strangers who come together to get away from their lives back in England. Add three of Britain's best male actors -- Alfred Molina, Jim Broadbent and then ever-appealing Michael Kitchen -- and it's a tiny masterpiece of a film. The villa and gardens,set high on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean, are such a feast of the eyes, it's one of the reasons it's a go-to movie for me for a quiet curl-up.",1481760000,,638,4.605263157894737

It really isn't a bad movie. If you are looking for action this isn't it. But it is a sweet and loving movie. Kind of a Romantic drama with less drama.",1478908800,,326,3.8088235294117645

2346408,2,B000A0GYUU,"This movie started out very promising...the scene is set with strong characters and the hint that perhaps these women of talent and substance might actually get out from under the oppression of living a life with their boorish and selfish husbands...maybe even find that life can be wonderful without being tied to a man...but the movie falls into a genre of predictability and stereotypical characterizations and takes an unrealistic leap that relationships can be mended easily and everyone can be happy without any consideration that the men in this movie most likely needed more than a few days away in a beautiful setting to make the serious changes needed to actually evolve into the men their wives could live with happily.  The movie was beautifully shot, and there were clever moments and funny instances, but overall, it was a downer for me and I felt cheated by the simplistic resolution to an actually complex setup.",1476748800,,928,4.987096774193549

2346568,4,B000A0GYUU,"I have always heard that this is a beautiful movie and finally I decided to buy it.
When I finished watching the movie I felt very optimistic thinking that problems could be resolved.
The plot started with two friends with some issues with their husbands. They decide to visit an old house with a beautiful garden in the South of Italy. There is another young lady there who also has some problems, as she was abandoned by her father who is the husband of one of the older ladies. All their problems are solved in this beautiful place at the end of the movie.
The quality of the DVD is not good, the main problem is in the darker scenes at the beginning of the movie, but it is worth seeing it because of the outstanding cast and lovely scene for a gorgeous garden settings.",1464566400,,774,4.344827586206897

Each woman has their own reason for going and their individual stories are what makes the movie.  What they find is that the villa really is enchanted or perhaps they just needed a break from their normal lives.  A number of humorous scenes and likeable characters make this very watchable.

2346778,4,B000A0GYUU,"A renewed visit to this old English film. A renewal of sorts for those in this film, old and dreary becomes fresh and new.

In the cold rainy London ""wisteria and sunshine,"" certainly sounds wonderful.  The bored, Lotte, played by Josie Lawrence enlists her neighbor, Rose, played by Miranda Richardson to rent a place in Italy. They need two more women to fulfill the need for the 60 pounds for the rent. Mrs. Fisher, played by Joan Plowright, the older if the group, a curmudgeon whose friends are now all dead.  and, then, Lady Caroline played by Polly Walker, the beauty from a rich family. She wants peace and quiet.

And they meet at San Salvatore in Italy where a little magic does its trick. Husbands appear, lost love reappears, new relationships develop, and all us right with the world. To find the rest of the story, enjoy the film.

I found it rather mysterious from the start, wondering what was around the corner after each scene.  Highly enjoyable and interesting storyline.  I enjoyed watching the skilled actors who are cast as fully conceived and interesting characters; being mesmerized by the visual changes from a rather gray, rainy period in England to a subtlely colorful and sunny Italy; and the enchantingly soothing music.  The climates and scenery set the tone for change that permeates and transforms each character in some way.

Not only would I not watch this one again, I wouldn't whole-heartedly recommend it, but...only because I didn't care for it very much. I think a family could watch this movie, I don't recall there being any adult language, it just didn't have that 'umph' factor to me. I don't want to be harsh and there weren't any specifics in particular that I can put my finger on, other than, I just didn't like this movie. The macho-ism of the men of this era--in London, and the submissiveness of the women, I have a hard time with that in general, even so, removing this from the equation, I still would not have liked this movie.

Then do as I do: seek out your truest friend (not only in the 'best buds' way, but spiritually as well) and take a trip to a magical, heavenly place of love, peace and joy, an ""enchanted"" place that upon arrival immediately begins to draw out all the cares and troubles that were so recently assaulting your mind like a plague. This place is restorative; you'll find yourself healed little by little, with kindness and compassion replacing the impatience and negativity so common to daily life -- and those you may now take for granted gaining in the respect and affection they once held in your eyes, so long ago.... One does not have to wait until April to be so beautifully transformed; one does not even have to travel physically to a southern Italian villa for the magic to happen. Just clear your busy schedule, darken your living room or wherever you watch your movies, pop in your personal copy of ""Enchanted April"", and dream.",1415318400,,1094,4.644329896907217

2346890,2,B000A0GYUU,"It's a dry as an old biscuit, and paper thin. Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright, two of the  biggest hams in the Britsh film business are quite restrained for a change, and Richardson in particular, suprisingly low key and effective. But it's not Merchant-Ivory, although it's trying deperately to replicate their great finesse and style. I found it deadly dull, average Sunday night television fare that somehow found itself released for the cinema, nothing more. I suppose the message is that if you change your attitude to the awful people around you, given a bit of sunny weather, an Italian location and a bowl of pasta, they'll magically change too. Which doesn't explain why the Miranda Richardson character is so enthusiastic about a man who's not her husband (and the only charming person in the film) and drops him like a hot potato the second her dreadful husband - who's been having it off with another character on the side - appears. No wonder the poor chap is confused.",1411344000,,988,4.846153846153846

What was annoying was the sound quality, it went up and down throughout the movie. We have an older tv but this was beyond that, it really fluctuated a lot in terms of the sound volume.

2346934,5,B000A0GYUU,"I really enjoy this movie. There is just something so appealing about lounging about at an Italian villa with its gorgeous gardens and breathtaking views and doing absolutely nothing. I understood the longing and the temptation that this place away from home offered these women. Each woman was struggling in their own way and just wanted the chance to be. That is just a hard thing to do when you are surrounded by people constantly wanting something from you and when you are drowning in your own despair of your situation. I was at first put off by the obvious desperation portrayed but it made for a better contrast letter when they are so peaceful and relaxed. I also appreciated the way Lottie eventually accepted that the only way to change her life for the better was for her to bring her husband over and accept him instead of just running away from her problems and how she eventually helped the other women. This movie appealed to me because I have felt what these women felt and have wished to find that same peace they eventually felt. Who hasn't imagined running away and going somewhere to relax? In a way, this movie gives me hope.",1404518400,,1147,4.6

It's one of those sentimental stories that has no action to speak of, no foul language, no nudity or sex scenes, but has ""something"" that draws you in. All the characters are believable and it's like you've been transported to an era that was still recovering from WW l.

2346970,5,B000A0GYUU,"I have enjoyed this character study of four English women which was filmed in the lush beauty of Italy, full of flowers, magnificent views, etc. many times through the years.  I find it timeless. Although the film was first shown +/- 20 years ago, I recognized several of the actors and actresses who have since made numerous, very successful films and television series.",1399075200,,371,4.888888888888889
2346971,5,B000A0GYUU,This movie was magical from beginning to end.  The characters sprang from complacent acceptance of their lives into joyful expectations for a future filled with love.  I didn't want it to end.,1398988800,,192,4.96875

2346973,4,B000A0GYUU,"This movie has all of tools necessary to assemble a great movie.  However, it falls short of greatness for  a couple of reasons.  The movie climaxes shortly into the film.  The rest seems like a denouement, a bit tidy and a tad predictable. Expected moments of dramatic tension flatten out into tepid, sentimental walk-throughs.  Also, the movie occasionally burdens itself with expository voice overs representing the thoughts of the principal characters.  The voice-overs are extraneous, add nothing, and perhaps insult viewers by telling them what they already know.  That said, this is a decent enjoyable film with good performances.  Don't avoid it because of this review.",1398729600,,677,5.320754716981132

2346975,5,B000A0GYUU,"I've loved this movie for years but only had it on VHS so decided to opt for a DVD - at a great price.
The story is set in England after the war, setting ladies who are strangers to each other off for a vacation at a castle.  The ladies have joined together to save $.  Complications ensue when the wayward husband of one shows up - and he has lots of surprises to deal with - wonderfully played by Alfred Molina.  Joan Plowright is the marvelous crotchety old lady with the proverbial heart of gold - and she plays her part to the hilt.  The moody actress start s out as an ouchy character but more lies beneath that outer skin.
Breathtaking scenery indoors and out combine with the terrific casting for a real ""escape"" movie - not maudlin or inane, just pleasant and classy.",1398643200,,776,4.294520547945205

I want to become part of it.  Here, I just felt like an observer.  The scenes were beautiful and costumes and cinematography was gorgeous, but I missed something somewhere on the storyline.  It just left me flat.",1398643200,,376,4.3
2346977,4,B000A0GYUU,Interesting story that develops slowly - in a good way!  This is not a fast-paced movie. The 1920's setting added charm but the issues that the four women were personally dealing with are not unique to that time period.  Happy ending...and I liked that.,1398556800,,253,4.7272727272727275

2346989,3,B000A0GYUU,"This is a little froth of a story, with the only enchantment for me being the improbability that walking sticks might indeed take root and sprout if planted, which is, I suppose, a parallel for whatever possibility for positive transformation is within us all, given the right scenario - in this case, a vacation in Italy.  The characters are more a vague outline than an in-depth study, with their dialogue and comments not in keeping with what we're given about them throughout the movie.  It is a period piece - the women seem naive, the men are cads, with the exception of the Tuscany villa's owner; and there is very little exposure to the Italian scenery or way of life.  When the DVD arrives, I'll watch it again to see if my problem with the movie is of my own doing - perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind; it did not draw me in - as I had hoped it would - to be lost in time and enchanted, if only for the length of the movie.",1397433600,,942,4.222222222222222

2347014,5,B000A0GYUU,"One of the definitions of 'enchantment' is 'a magical spell,' and this movie does seem to cast a spell. I hadn't seen it in several years when I came across it on Amazon a few nights ago, and even watching on my laptop it hasn't lost a bit of it's magic.

From the music to the cinematography to the actors, this movie evokes a time and place in a way that feels warm and welcoming. But, it is the story that is captivating--who wouldn't like to escape their life for a month in an Italian seaside villa and return home with issues resolved, a happy new outlook, and lifelong friends?

This is the first movie review I've written, and the tips say to include who would like this movie. So, who would that be? Anyone who likes English movies, anyone who likes period movies, anyone who likes the romantic without the 'romance' (in other words, the dynamics of mature relationships instead of a lot of angst and flinging clothes), but mostly, anyone who appreciates an opportunity to relish all that is good and lovely in the world and in people.

If you prefer adrenaline churning movies that leave you feeling depressed, angry, scared, lusty, or exhausted from laughing, Enchanted April is not for you. But, if you would like a movie experience that leaves you feeling happy, relaxed, refreshed, and optimistic, you'll enjoy the quiet, quirky humor and gentle telling of Enchanted April.

For me, movies are a two-hour vacation; some are riding-the-rapids wild, some are Disneyworld, and some, like Enchanted April, are a luxurious spa.",1393891200,,1536,4.7631578947368425

2347016,5,B000A0GYUU,"Such an optimistic and visually soothing way to spend an evening! I especially love how Lottie chose to be generous instead of stingy in showing kindness to her husband, and how others changed in response to kindness and optimism.
When I told my husband I had watched it while he was at a meeting, he asked, ""Did you still like it?"" I answered ""More than ever!""",1393632000,,361,4.484848484848484

Fix a cup of tea and your favorite snack, turn off all phones and devices that distract, sit back, relax, and enjoy. There are no explosions, no graphic scenes of violence or sex, no earth-shattering events. Instead we are treated to a story about love, simple on its surface but with surprising depths of insight. Warmth, wit, charm, delight...a perfect movie when one needs to unwind.",1392940800,,463,4.728395061728395

The characters perfectly embody the behaviors and culture of the WW I era. They all experience the same mystical journey, from sad and gloomy London to this magical house in Italy. And the costumes! The fabrics, the hats...really wonderful.

Watch this movie when you're sick to death of the constant scroll of bad/exploitative/infotainment that invades every aspect of our lives. Immerse yourself in this movie and turn it up, to hear the music, the breeze, the birds, in the background. Really enjoy the interplay between these really fine and underappreciated actors.

2347027,5,B000A0GYUU,"I saw this rambling around on cable one day and fell in love with it immediately.  I've loved Josie Lawrence on the British ""Who's Line Is It Anyway"" series and hadn't known she'd done serious film.  I started watching it for her and she is wonderful!  Far better than I expected, but I should have.  She could do anything on ""Who's Line...""  But the story and the rest of the outstanding cast got me hooked.  It's simple and so very sweet with gentle, satisfying romance at every turn without any of it being contrived or sappy, all influenced by the magic of the Italian countryside.  The relationship between Josie and Joan Plowright's characters is one of my favorites.  I had the DVD, loaned it out and now need another copy as my friend can't part with it.

Which has nothing to do with the movie!
The Brits do this sort of thing so well...add Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright to the cast...and the other three whose names escape me, Polly ???, Michael Hitchens (?) and two other, who are, actually, the prime movers in the plot...and I should be shot for losing their names!

Excellent performances all around.  Totally enchanting film.  A remake of an early black and white talkie with Ann Harding that did not do it justice.

2347066,5,B000A0GYUU,"I first saw this movie years ago on VHS and finally got a copy of it on DVD.  This is a quiet movie that unfolds gently and will probably appeal more to a female audience.

Enchanted April is the story of two British women who are tired of the cold and the gloom and the rain in London...and they seem to be equally tired of their restricted lives.  Lottie is one women, whose husband seems only interested in how he can get ahead in business and thinks his wife is pretty uninteresting.  Lottie ropes Rose into joining her on their adventure in renting a vila/castle in Italy for a whole month.  Rose also is pretty lost, being that her husband writes the trashy sex novels of the day and spends his time chasing after pretty young things.

They can't afford this grand vila among the wisteria, so they get two other women to join them.  Mrs Fisher who spends her days pretty much living in the past, among her photos and letters, and Lady Caroline who is weary of the grand life of a pretty young thing much in demand and just wants to go someplace quiet and relax.  Together, they venture into the Italian landscape, the wild gardens and the rocky seashore of San Salvatori...and re-discover not just themselves but romance itself.

Yes, its a quiet and even slow movie at times, but the pacing is perfect for the story.  This is a movie about enchantment, about being quiet enough to hear your own heart, and about the kindling or re-kindling of love.  It makes you want to visit such a place and stay for a month in the sunshine...",1390521600,,1536,4.430604982206406

a fairy tale land on the Italian Riviera (Porto Bello) is just as intriguing as what happens after they arrive.
The peace of the Mediterranean, the mansion they stay in, the funny things that happens with the cook, the gardener;
a lot of Italian spoken, some words I knew, some I don't. Then there's Natalie Richardson (of the Redgrave fame), and others
too many to mention. If you loved laid back, artistic, tight shots of flowers, trees, and the terrain, of emotional responses,
and happy, funny people, (yes it's all subjective!), get this, and go on a wonderful mental vacation to the Italian coast!

The roles are beautifully cast and beautifully acted.  The interactions between the ladies and the visitors who sometimes surprise them are amusing and touching.

It is a lovely love story. The acting is first rate and the characters are believable, but I don't think the quickly developed relationship between Briggs and Caroline will last.  One review said it is ""dated"", I don't agree.  It is merely set in time after WWI, the problems the ladies faced are still relevant.
And, of course, not everything needs to have car chases, gun fights and ninja assassins to be interesting.  If you need ninja assassins for the movie to be interesting to you, then this one is not going to make you happy, but it is still a wonderful movie.",1388620800,,810,4.373333333333333

They leave behind the dull, dreary, drabness of their lives in England and blossom in the Italian sunshine. Each finds an inner peace and calm which is reflected in an outward beauty.

The contrast between wet and very drear London, and the glory of Italy in the gorgeous castle - a bit rough around the edges - fills me with delight.  A bunch of diverse characters, all in various stages of throwing off the gloom of London and enjoying to the fullest the sunlit days and the rich Mediterranean garden very similar to our own gardens here in Australia.  I quite understand how people from the south want to flock to Queensland to enjoy warm winters, and glorious beaches.  And of course, Joan Plowright at her best!

2347192,5,B000A0GYUU,"I've watched this many times through the years and am still in awe of the 1st morning the characters find themselves in the breathtaking villa on the coast of Italy. Their reaction and the visuals play beautifully against the grey, cold darkness of the beginning sequence of story, character set up in post-WWI in London. The actors are all believable and at times, quite funny. In particular, Joan Plowright, Josie Lawrence, Polly Walker and Miranda Richardson all play very distinct women who find their way to being happy and finding love and friendship. Have not read the book the film is based but this remains a film I try to push on anyone needing a wonderful ensemble cast, an amazing fairy tale story with the south western coast of Italy itself being a key character. Other films of transplants in Italy or france are fun to watch for some of the reasons to watch this: Under the Tuscan Sun and A Good Year come to mind. This is the standard to which they can only aspire.",1375056000,,982,4.5852272727272725

In need of two more to share expenses, they are quickly joined by a beautiful socialite, Polly Walker, who men never leave alone, and an aging litterateur, Joan Plowright, who lives in the past with her beloved, deceased, late-Victorian poets, Tennyson, the Rosettis, and others.

The move into the villa is full of sharp asides, the sorting out of bedrooms, sitting rooms, etc.--all evenly and diplomatically handled by Josie. Patterns are established; laughter ripples through the days. The Plowright character takes up her watercolor board. Josie decides she's been selfish to her husband and invites him to join them, a flirtation opens beween both the Pollly character and the Richardson character, whose husband writes ""adult"" fiction,"" and the owner of the villa who shows up during the last week of their stay. He has been partially blinded during the war. One full-mooned night each finds the destined other.

Josie's husband brushing her luxuriant hair whispers, ""When did I forget how beautiful you are?"" The beautiful socialite learns looks won't last forever as the villa owner pays the Richardson character far more attention than she, the be all and end all of beauty, sits restlessly by. She and Richardson''s husband who had been planning an affair see the emptiness of their plan and the hurt it would cause. I''ll save the salvation-bringing closing scenes for you to discover.

With that being said I think this is the best feel good movie ever made. I love watching this move late at night when I'm up alone or on a stormy evening drinking a nice hot cup of tea, the acting is great without giving the movie away. I love the way theses characters friendship transforms into something wonderful, it has its sad, and very humorous moments.

Two middle-class English housewives, tired of the dreary London weather and their inattentive husbands, pool their savings to rent a villa on the Italian Riviera for the month of April. The villa has four bedrooms so to save money, they sublet two of the rooms to a couple of upper-class ladies, a snooty widow and a bored socialite. At first, the differences in their social classes lead to clashes, but eventually they all become best friends. The scenery is beautiful and the acting sublime. This is a feel good movie that will leave you wanting to plan your own trip to Italy.

But the real star of the show - Josie Lawrence - is hardly heard of in the USA, and that's a shame! She's a brilliant comedienne and has a charming, unaffected way of acting in this film. You may have actually seen her on a few episodes of Who's Line Is It Anyway?

It is a film that helps boys understand how relationships work...well or not.  Communication, honesty and mutual respect all with a backdrop of Italy in April.  I only buy films I believe are timeless.  This one is right up there with Chariots of Fire, The Windslow Boy, 84 Charing Cross Road.  Quiet films that leave big wakes.  These films make us more sensitive, human.  They leave subtle footprints opening paths wide with insights.

I am purchasing this DVD because I wore out my VHS.

Nuanced performances and an entertaining illustration of the constraints of personal masks and social rolesand how the courage of an individual can catalyze the transformation and blossoming of others into their fuller expression.

You get to know each woman and her lot in life (lightly). Then you get to see how each changes in a positive way. This is a chick flick, the a guy who reads, and likes character study will enjoy this also. Light entertainment with style. Something we don't get enough of in movies.

2347241,3,B000A0GYUU,"The Golden Globes are ridiculous.  The fact that this was nominated under the Comedy category and then went ahead and won two acting awards (for the least engaging performances in the film) is just preposterous.  This is not a comedy.  It is not funny.  I'm not saying that it isn't a good film (not great, but it is good) but what I'm saying is that the marketing for this film is off.

This is one of your more mellow and relaxed examples of period film; a film that takes it time developing some themes that don't quite fully connect (that rushed ending was ill-advised) and yet it definitely holds your attention despite the slow pacing.

The film, adapted from the novel written by Elizabeth Von Arnim, tells the story of two unhappily married women (Lottie and Rose) who pool their money together to take a vacation for a month alone in Italy.  They rent a villa and convince two other women (a grumpy old woman and a man-eating socialite) to accompany them in order to split expenses.  The villa has a positive effect on the women (all four of them) and soon their troubles at home seem almost trivial to the point where both Lottie and Rose are inviting their husbands to join them.  Love is in the air, even for the elderly Mrs. Fisher who's heart softens for her housemates, and soon everything is joyous and wonderful and...then it ends.

Seriously.

I loved the look and feel of the film and the collective performances (except for Josie Lawrence who was awful) are great but the progression of story leaves a lot to be desired.  In hearing that it was originally made for British TV explains a lot, for there are parts where it actually feels like a poorly spliced together television mini-series.  I wasn't a fan of the multiple narrative voices and I felt like the film's conclusion was far too rushed and underdeveloped, especially with regard to the triangular relationship of Rose, Frederick and Caroline and the surprise love interest found in George.  It just kind of told you this was all happening and then BAM, the credits started to roll.

Plowright is funny but nothing more than a gimmick and Richardson is somewhat dull (especially considering her other two roles that very same year).  Broadbent is engaging and Polly Walker is certainly best in show here.

I wanted to love this but I felt like it just couldn't tie all the loose ends together and at the end of the day it was a poor man's Merchant Ivory production.",1360800000,,2445,4.622685185185185

In some parts, the scenes were so dark, it was difficult to see the action.  And in some scenes, the lighting faded almost to black and then it came back.  All in all, the quality is very poor, especially at the beginning of the movie.  Are all of the DVD's of this movie like this?

A woman that is bored to death with her life and marriage has the courage to convince other women to rent this lovely home in Italy to escape the rain and their marriages in London.

Funny how the men change once they are out of their controlling environment!! The men see their wives in a new light and suddenly what attracted the women to their husbands, is revived.

The negatives would be the quality of the video and the fact that we don't see enough of the beauties of this Italian retreat.

The positives include surprises in the personalities of the characters.

I love the premise of it: Place four utterly original, strong women together who don't know each other in a beautiful medieval Italian castle on the water for a month and see what happens. How they act, react and grow from each other is delicious. The casting in this film is brilliant and the scenery is divine.

You feel you know these women, you've been these women, or lived with them. They think thoughts you've had about yourself, relationships, and life. I love movies in which characters become their best version of themselves through a changed environment.

If you haven't read the book by the same name, it's a delight:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enchanted-April-New-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172256/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enchanted April (New York Review Books Classics)</a>.  The movie captures the feel of the book, but it's fun to read additionally.

The book is also one of my top 10 favorite books of the past 20 years or so, and I savor every word when reading it. It's that good. And original. It would be an excellent book group selection. But the action and adventure is in the character development and introspection, not in actual events transpiring.

With Alfred Molina and Joan Plowright heading a good cast, and having heard and read strong reviews for the film, I thought it would be a film I would enjoy.  In short, it's alright, but it moves too slowly - and I like quiet, slowly unfolding films - but this one is simply too slow and uninteresting for my taste.  Part of the problem is that the film seems very dated.  The quality of the film itself is not very good, and everything about it seems lackluster.

""Enchanted April"" is my favorite movie - I have watched it many, many times!!  I have read the wonderful book, and the movie captures perfectly the charm of the book!
I love the dialogue - such cute one-liners:  ""Have you noticed how difficult it is to be improper when there are no men about?""
Everything about it is beyond reproach - the acting, the story, the cinematography, the music... and the moral of the story:  When one really loves someone, it doesn't matter how that person looks on the outside, it's what's inside that counts.
It also perfectly captures the time period!",1312329600,,633,4.584070796460177

2347372,5,B000A0GYUU,"This is such a delightful and uplifting movie. The story revolves around four women - two unhappily married women [played by Josie Lawrence & Miranda Richardson], a curmudgeon of a widow [Joan Plowright], and an upper-class disenchanted beauty [a luminous Polly Walker, most recently seen in the HBO mini-series Rome]...all four co-rent a beautiful Italian palazzo for a month circa the 1920s. Josie Lawrence acts so convincingly in her role that you truly believe in the magic of the place & time, and that life does not have to be complicated unless one wants it to be. Miranda Richardson plays her role as the uptight wife of an author quite well, with great facial expressions that give us a glimpse into her emotional upheaval. Joan Plowright is delightful as the grumpy widow, and Polly Walker is convincing in her role as a jaded aristocrat.

The men in this movie are definitely just supporting characters, but each one, from the guy that plays the owner of the palazzo, to Jim Broadbent's author, and finally Alfred Molina's stuffy solicitor are significant in enhancing the plot. The cinematography is simply beautiful, evoking the lushness of the Italian landscape, and the uplifting tone of the movie definitely makes this a must-watch, especially for those of us who have moments when our spirits are flagging.",1309824000,,1323,5.013636363636364

THE ITALIANS ARE AS CONFUSED BY THEIR BRITISH VISITORS AS WE ARE BY THEIR FUSSY BEHAVIOR.

There were little defects that showed up, blips that were on the screen for a few seconds, happening about 3 or 4 times. It totally takes away from the experience, making it clear we are at the cheap movies, not totally engrossed in a delightful story.

Despite 3 other ""A"" list British actresses this movie just wouldn't have worked had not the beautiful socialite (totally exhausted by admirers) been played by an actress with an appropriate 20's style drop-dead beauty. Added to which Polly Walker hit all right notes with her upper-class mannerisms - and impeccably polite (I'm so beautiful) languor.  So in this very entertaining fast paced movie with constantly surprising plot twists I recommend buying this 1993 movie (at very reasonable 2010 prices) especially to see Polly Walker's ""still point at the turning world"" (Eliot) contribution to a perfectly realized British confection.",1287705600,,801,5.451612903225806
2347419,5,B000A0GYUU,"I had a friend who kept nagging me to watch this movie. I was assured that I would love it.  Well, I started to watch it and the first couple of minutes seemed rather dull to me -- little did I know that this movie would turn out to be one of my alltime favorites.

I especially like such movies as ""Tea With Mussolini"",  ""Avalon"" and ""Room With a View"".  And, as much as I liked those, I like this one a hundred times more! Why?  I'm not actually sure of the exact reason. I tend to think it appeals to a certain type of person.

I can say the actors are absolutely excellent, the scenery is beautiful, but I suppose it is the engaging storyline (that many women especially can relate to) that makes it particularly attractive to me. Also, the pace of the movie is appealing. That is an unusual reason I suppose, but the timing of the scenes is simply perfect.

Everyone who was involved with the project of making this movie should feel very proud of such a fine product (without hesitation I gave it five stars).  I suppose the person who deserves the most praise would have to be the author of the book the movie was based on.  In any case, I LOVE it, and many thanks to everyone who participated in the making of this fine movie.",1278892800,,1234,4.239316239316239

It's got romance, humor, and quiet introspection. I want to warn you that not a lot happens in the film. My favorite image is Miranda Richardson lying on the grassy hillside in Italy, dozing and trying to decide if she should invite her husband to the villa she and her friends have escaped to during London's rainy dreary spring. This movie is appropriate for grandmas and infants.",1275436800,,519,4.591397849462366

They invite two other women (who they don't know) to help cover expenses.  What happens is magical.

This is about love.  Love between friends, love between husband and wife, new found love, old love.  There are a few interesting twists and turns - and the ending, well... you'll never be sorry you bought this.",1275436800,,590,4.660194174757281

I too waited several years for this to come out on DVD as I had it on tape and laser disc.  So happy it finally was released and thank Amazon for encouraging fans to pre-order so the manufacturer could be persuaded to release.  It is probably just a ""chick flick"" to some but it certainly is the best one I've ever seen.  I see it every six months just for the way this movie makes me feel - like dialing up my travel agent and booking a trip to Italy.  The Villa is magic and the men and women characters so very rich and diverse thanks to excellent directing and acting.  The emotional reactions you can experience in watching this film are uplifting and just the one for a gloomy day!  Very few movies get five stars from me, if they do, they are usually British as they still are best at acting and telling a story in the most bewitching way!

I especially love Josie Lawrence who I have never seen in anything else before or since, and of course Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright are wonderful.  Even the menfolk characters are well-written and performed and there is no man-bashing so common in ""girls"" movies.  Heck, even the husbands may want to watch this one.

Enchanted April is a beautiful film and deserves to have the clarity it needs to show off the incredible scenery, the actors, etc. I still love this movie, and will keep it but I am encouraging the studio that released it to ""upgrade"" the quality so we can trade our inferior DVDs and enjoy the movie at its best.",1251676800,,608,4.1525423728813555

The film takes place during the 1920's, and each of the four women who embark on this Italian adventure brings her own particular grievance reflective of the time. The way in which each of them experience the flavors of Italy and interact with one another brings about a transformation in attitude.

What I love about the movie is how it makes me feel like the sun is warm on my skin and I am feeling the sea weed run through my fingers. I tell people it is a ""sensual"" film.
 This is such a beautiful movie that I was hoping the DVD would have been remastered or whatever it takes to make the pictures clear and bright. Unfortunately, it is just as grainy and drab as the VHS. The commentary did explain (I guess) that they had a very small budget and that it was filmed on 16mm for the BBC television. Then, it was changed to 35mm for limited theatre release. This is the reason I have given it 4 out of 5 stars.",1248048000,,769,4.026143790849673
2347486,5,B000A0GYUU,"I will skip reviewing the plot, since many have already done so. Instead, I will write about how I feel about this amazing film. I remember years ago, when I was in my early 20's working in a video store, a man came in to return the video saying it was the worst film he had ever seen. My jaw dropped, because I was totally entranced by this same film, which I had gone to the movies to see three times when it was out the year before.

Now, at 41, I am still awed by its beauty. Since its release, I have always looked to 'Enchanted April' to take me away. And it always does. The acting is superb (or course, look at the cast!) and the cinematography is gorgeous (OK, so what if they used fake wisteria). To quote from the movie: ""This place makes me feel flooded with love."" Just replace the word 'place' with 'film' and there you have it.

Made primarily for BBC TV, I am still amazed this film was transferred into enhanced Widescreen. In doing so, we seem to lose a bit of image. A perfect example is when Polly Walker's character bumps into Rose's husband, who just arrived and is climbing the stairs to the castle. In the regular version, we see Polly wearing the typical 1920's strapped shoes. This scene remains on my mind because I remember thinking at the time how tightly (uncomfortably so) strapped around her ankles they were. These are not seen in the widescreen version as they are cut off from the screen. Regardless, this film is flawless and its beauty is sure to remain with you for a long time.",1247443200,,1516,4.334507042253521

Few movies feel like they are restoreing you soul and this movie is the very best at reminding you that life itself is the adventure and everyting else we add to it is the cream.

Four ladies at different points in their lives are the unlikely sharers of a month by the sea in a castle in Italy. They are all at crossroads in life and somehow this beautiful place gives then the time they need to sort out what is really important in life.

As one actor say, getting on with your loving is the most important thing. For two that is a rekindling of their love for their selves and their husbands, for one it is to rejoin the living and enjoy what time she has left and for the last it is just to be brave enough to stop mourning a lost love and begin to love again.

The characters are all very well developed. The varied story lines and individual awakenings on the part of all the movies characters as they grow in their personal lives and their self-awareness is well written and beautifully photographed with a little humor thrown in for good measure.  Not just a movie for the women, I loved this movie as much as my wife did. I think everyone will learn a little bit about themselves in watching this movie.

The acting from all around is superb, the story wonderful and the editing, photography, direction and soundtrack top notch. The scene when the characters awake for their first morning in Italy is just gorgeous.(FYI..cuckoos steal other bird's nests)

Miranda Richardson always seems to give her best when directed by Newell and here is no exception. It a very low keyed, subdued performance, but absolutely right. She allows the other actors to chew the scenery and they and she gains from this approach. If you think you know these performers, (Broadbent, Molina, Plowright), you'll be pleasantly surprised.

But.....after so long I was expecting so much more. For $20 there are no extra's..the commentary has Newell and the producer, no one else. There is no making of...there are no current interviews with the actors and even the print doesn't look as if its been cleaned up in any remarkable way....my old worn out VHS looks very similar. If any move screams for the Criterion treatment, this is it.

Eventually this DVD will go down in price. Unless you absolutely must have it today (much like me unfortunately) wait. For $10 its right. For $20...and I hate to say this...it's just not worth it.",1245715200,,1347,4.8478260869565215

2347510,5,B000A0GYUU,"The beautiful, privileged--and bored--Lady Caroline utters these words as she gradually succumbs to the spell of the enchanted sun-drenched garden of an Italian castello to which she has retreated as a refuge from the tiresome London Season, in which men persistently ""grab."" She is one of an unlikely quartet of women who have rented the villa, perched on a cliff above the Tyrrhenian Sea, for the month of April. Each of the others has her own reasons for escaping: a repressive marriage, the relentlessly thankless responsibilities of doing good works, and just plain willfulness--all of which are exacerbated by the seemingly endless downpour of London rain. All of their respective problems, however, boil down to an essential loneliness, for which the Ligurian coast of Itlay provides the antidote.

In this high-calibre ensemble cast, Joan Plowright stands out as the sour, embittered bluestocking, Mrs. Fisher, who has staked a claim of having been the confidant of the 19th-century literary illuminati (but not Keats!); her main problem is that they are all dead. Josie Lawrence plays the awkwardly outspoken Lottie, who persuades a slight acquaintance, Rose--a devout woman with a philandering husband--to go halves and answer an advert, which promises wisteria and sunshine. Miranda Richardson, who with her smooth  red hair looks as if she belongs in a Pre-Raphaelite painting,  endows her character with a tranquil charm, which quite captivates the owner of the villa, Mr. Briggs, a myopic First-World-War veteran. Michael Kitchen is at his most engaging in the role of the solitary man who finds solace in playing the oboe. Polly Walker, who seemingly floats on air, is convincing as the world-weary Lady Caroline.

As the setting works its spell on the women, one almost wishes that they not spoil it by inviting their menfolk (Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent) to stay; but all that is part of the enchantment, and to say any more would spoil it for you.

""Enchanted April"" is not only beautiful to view, but it also has its moments of high comedy, especially in scenes with Plowright, Molina, and Broadbent. And while the film will make one feel awfully good, it is never syrupy. If I have a criticism, it is one of omission. I wanted to see more of the story after the husbands and Mr. Briggs arrived. The film ended too soon. But that flaw merely makes one want to watch ""Enchanted April"" again.

2347518,5,B000A0GYUU,"Based on a novel by popular turn of the last-century author, Elizabeth von Arnim, this is a gentle tale of four women and their spring holiday in a charming small castle on the Italian Riviera, a place full of wisteria and sunshine ... and renewal.

Lottie Wilkins (Josie Lawrence) is fussy and down-trodden, married to the overbearing Mellersh (Alfred Molina). Lottie and her friend Rose Arbuthnot (Miranda Richardson) who is just as unhappy in her marriage to Frederick the author of racy novels (Jim Broadbent) who is not above flirting - or even more - with other women. It is drab and rainy, in post-WWI London, and the two women want to get away for a holiday from the rain, their dreary lives and unhappy marriages. And like a miracle, they discover an advertisement for a castle for rent; but to make it work, they must invite two more people to share expenses. They find the elderly widow, Mrs. Fisher - living on memories of better days, when she was not relatively poor, and was friends with many of the literary figures of that day - but not Keats, as she acidly points out to the other ladies. The final member of their quartet is the beautiful socialite, Lady Caroline Dester (Polly Walker), who wants to get away from the exhausting social whirl - but mostly away those men in it.

So this odd and apparently incompatible quartet are off to Italy, and a month-long stay in a picture-perfect mellowed-stone castle, set in a marvelous garden, overlooking the sea - and the remainder of the plot unfolds at a leisurely pace. The castle is as magical as Lottie and Rose had hoped, and over the weeks it works on all of them: Mrs. Fisher's prickly nature mellows, as she becomes a kind of matriarch. Lady Caroline, astonishingly enough, finds love in the form of the castle's eccentric musician owner. Rose and her husband renew their own affections, and Lottie - initially rather pathetic and ineffectual - emerges as a serene and wise presence, at the very heart of this odd and self-selected family. The sense of place and time is impeccable, and the castle itself is almost another character.

This movie is highly recommended for anyone like me, who is sick to death of movies containing car-chases, massive explosions and endless rounds of machine-gun fire.

The only extra included is a commentary by director Mike Newell and producer Ann Scott.",1243123200,,2362,4.753658536585366

With no TV and my VHS long gone anyway, there is nothing to do but stick with this, but, I'm not pleased and am recommending to anyone who can wait to do so until they bring the production values up to at least the mid 20th century",1242691200,,454,4.481927710843373
2347522,5,B000A0GYUU,"Just a review that responds to the criticisms about the video quality.  If you listen to the Director's & Producer's commentary on the special features, you will learn the movie was shot on 16mm film--and was originally planned as a TV-Movie!  There's only so much you can do to 16mm film, as opposed to 35mm and larger film.  All the ""digital remastering"" in the world probably can't do too much for it. So I don't think the DVD can be validly criticized for its video quality.  It is what it is.

The movie, however is an absolute gem--an astonishing piece of quality work.  What is funny is when the commentary states that one advantage of having a very limited (TV-scale) budget is that you don't have ""big studios"" breathing down your neck when you are choosing the cast for the movie--they got exactly who they chose to have.  This is precisely the reason for the movie's success.  The actors all seemed to have understood the mood and character of the movie and its storyline.  It was shot in only 26 days, and only 2 1/2 days were sunny in Italy!!  The commentary is excellent, especially if you want to hear some really good personal insight in making movies in general.

2347526,4,B000A0GYUU,"In 1922, Elizabeth von Arnim, a British novelist famous for many novels which include the 1898 novel ""Elizabeth and Her German Garden"" and the 1917 novel ""Christine"" (or Alice Cholmondeley) wrote the 1922 novel ""The Enchanted April"".  The novel would inspire a play and would have its first film adaption in 1935.

But in 1992, director Mike Newell (""Donnie Brasco"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and the upcoming ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"") and screenwriter Peter Barnes adapted the novel to a film  and in 1993, the film would go on to win two Golden Globe Awards (Best Actress - Miranda Richardson and Best Supporting Actress - Joan Plowright) and nominated for three Academy Awards.

And now as part of MIRAMAX's ""Award Winning Collection"", the DVD release of ""ENCHANTED APRIL"" is now finally here.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""ENCHANTED APRIL"" is presented in Widescreen (1:85:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  The picture quality does show its age and there is a tremendous amount of grain and dust and scratches are quite evident.  So, I was a bit surprised this film didn't get a digital remastered treatment.

Despite the film's picture quality, there are a few things that really standout.  Moreso for the cinematography.  For one, the overall location of where the film was shot is absolutely beautiful.  The lush vegetation, the flowers, the blue skies and blue ocean and also to keep the 1920's style and feel courtesy of Sheena Napier's costume design.

As for audio, the feature sports a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The film is dialogue heavy with the occasonal music to showcase the mood and beauty of the villa but audio is primarily dialogue driven.  Dialogue is clearly heard.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, there is only one feature and that is the feature's commentary with Director Mike Newell and Producer Ann Scott.  You can tell its been a long time since these two have seen the film and it's like they are seeing it for the first time.  Both talk about the challenge of getting the film financed but also the challenges of filming at the villa and getting the beautiful shots.

There are periods of no commentary as both Newell and Scott are just delighted by the acting of the talent.  But since 17 years have passed since the film was released, some scenes are difficult for Director Newell to recall.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""ENCHANTED APRIL""is a story that has enchanted many readers and also viewers for decades.  A film about four women who want to escape their own reality, even if it is just for a little time to reflect on their own personal lives and to realize what they want, what makes them happy and if anything, an act of independence.

The film does showcase such a beautiful location and to see each of the four women transformed, revitalized and most of all, to see how the location changes them and their thoughts was nice to see.  Lottie who is seen desperately wanting to get away from her drab life and living a life of mostly being a servant, is instantly transformed to a woman who wants to make her own decisions but invites the very person she was trying to get away from.  Both instantly find each other.

And of course, without having to spoil the film, to see how each of the women find themselves is the film's strongest point.

Having not read the 1922 novel, one of the positive remarks by those who have read the original novel and have seen the 1993 film, have said the film follows the novel closely.  No director's change of interpretation of Elizabeth von Arnim's popular novel but keeping consistent.

But I will have to be truthful that many fans of this film have awaited its DVD release and hoping for it to look a lot better than their old VHS copy.  The film does look good on DVD, especially during the outdoor scenes showcasing the villa but for some reason, I was amazed by the amount of grain, scratches and dust that appeared on the final DVD cut of the film. For it to be part of the MIRAMAX AWARD WINNING COLLECTION, I was hoping that like other collections being released on DVD, their would be digitally remastering for a classic film like this.

Another thing I was hoping was to see more special features.  Especially new interviews with the cast and their feelings of the film after all these years, for a film on DVD that people have been waiting for, I just wished there was more than the commentary included.  But at least, fans do get a commentary track by Director Mike Newell and Producer Ann Scott.

Overall, an enchanting and entertaining film makes its long-awaited debut to DVD and for fans of this film, definitely a film worth checking out.",1241568000,,4639,4.698019801980198

While reading the newspaper they see an add for a castle in Italy that is for available for rent during the month of April.  Despite the disapproval of their husbands and society in general, they decide to rent it.  In order to pay the bills, they also invite two other women, a young, beautiful socialite and a dowager grand dame.  They travel to Italy and the Enchantment begins.  The movie is so beautifully shot.  You feel immersed in the sights and sounds of a most glorious Italian countryside.

It's a quiet, lovely story about four very different English women... and how a month in Italy changes each of them.  I first saw this film many years ago while on vacation in San Francisco.  It was raining that evening, and we knew nothing about the movie.  Since then, I have watched it over and over.  I'm so happy that it's coming out on DVD, as my VHS is starting to wear thin.

2347577,5,B000A0GYUU,"This movie validates the universality of woman's quest for meaning in Life. I dare say many women have dreamt along with the tale, of ending their ( perceived or real) isolation and finding hope in the midst of their grey mundane lives. I loved the poster she kept hidden in the cupboard of her ""vacation fantasy spot"". The lack of attention her spouse remembered to bestow upon her is all too common. I recommend this, and it's surprisingly upbeat and hopeful end, to all who feel they have lost sight of their vivid purposeful life. It is the quintessential story of unconditional love and acceptance, healing the hearts of self and others.

For women 35 and up. It requires a level of empathy that only living lonely, as an adult woman may impart. Especially for peri -menopausal women who are struggling with the next immanent passage in their life. It offers hope, a lovely travelogue and resolution of life's Path across a colorless daily drudgery . Creative* plot and quixotic mix of characters and sub plots. It presents us with a compassionate view of several ""personality types"" and how a positive intent can manifest in finding True Self in the midst of private inner sorrow.",1233532800,,1186,4.785365853658536
2347578,5,B000A0GYUU,"I had the great good fortune to see this lovely film in an art house cinema more than 20 years ago. I understand it was originally a television show filmed for BBC. Imagine anything this beautifully shot for U.S. TV- would never happen! There's an old B & W film made from the same source material, a book printed in the early 20th century and before THAT film, it was a hit play in London around the 1930's if I'm not mistaken. Haven't read the original book or seen the play, but the B & W film doesn't hold a candle to Mike Newell's production.

It's impossible not to adore the film: with the brilliant cast, gorgeous backdrop of Portofino beautifully shot and the universal experiences of the characters who are desperate to relax, get away from rigid social rules governing every waking moment, and a dank climate. Slowly, they  re-connect with the natural world, re-examine their lives and relationships, forge new ones and sometimes learn to feel & communicate new appreciation for relationships that had already been established but had become taken for granted and stultified. Everyone & everything blossoms in the Italian sunshine.

It seems the writer of the original book upon which this film and the previous one were based struck a chord with her contemporaries when the book was originally published, and it has continued to do so with each new generation.

It's an intelligent, believable adult fairy tale. The camera work is beyond excellent and the music is superb even as it is unobtrusive. Best of all, it's the opposite of Hollywood. That means no cookie cutter beauties, no slick easy answers, no pasting over awkward moments by incompetent writers with tired pop tunes.

2347640,5,B000A0GYUU,"Enchanted April is one of those films that takes you by surprise. No blockbuster, just a soft and gentle romance of the kind the Brits do better than anybody elsep; not trivial as it has a solid story of various separate lives that all intertwine for a month. No violence, no sex, no gratuitous bad language. Mostly middle-aged Englishwomen on holiday in an Italian villa in April. Nothing for them to do but sit around. Perfect formula for a perfect yawn... but the film begins on a wet and dull afternoon in period London at the end of winter and gradually transforms into a sunlit film, full of excellent English character actors, and gently weaves a web that entrances the viewer. We bought this film on video over a decade ago and I guess we've seen it half a dozen times. It is the perfect film for when you don't want violence, sex and bad language, just a delightful light romance. But don't take this categorizing by me wrong, the acting is superb, and the gradual transformation of each character  generally surprising and welcome. Jim Broadbent is a joy and Alfred Molina his usual great self. The women are all magnificent. We eagerly expected the film to be issued on DVD ages ago, and can only suppose that there must be distribution contractual problems that have held it up. The Swedish and Australian prints support this supposition.",1210032000,,1350,4.69620253164557

2347675,5,B000A0GYUU,"Enchanted April is simply a wonderful film, filled with quiet romance and the mystery of life and love. Watching this film is like watching a beautiful flower bloom from the most miniscule, dew-covered bud. There is a charm and warmth found here that is sadly missing in film today.

When an ad is placed in the paper offering a vacation of wisteria and sunshine at a castle by the sea in Italy, two Englishwomen with only a passing acquaintance from church, Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Rose (Miranda Richardson), leave their mates behind to join two other women for an April to remember.

The two other women are as different as night and day, yet will be affected by their surroundings in the same magical way. Joan Plowright is delightful as the elderly Mrs. Fisher, who begins to live again under the spell of wisteria and sunshine. But it is beautiful Polly Walker's portrayel of Caroline Hester, with her magic eyes and Louise Brooks look, that nearly steals the show.

The internal musings of Lottie and Rose, meanwhile, prompt both women to do the unthinkable and send for their husbands. This brings about some humorous and unexpected events to this April on the Riviera.

Just as in the gentle and beautiful novel, each will begin to find inner happiness and a rebirth of love. Very few films have the ability to refresh the soul and leave you feeling good about life like this magical film. Those in need of a region two format will find something special here. Take your own enchanted holiday by picking this up as soon as you can.",1207785600,,1543,4.682656826568266

For Those who love Wisteria and Sunshine...
Small Italian Castle to let for the month of April.

Finding this ad in a daily newspaper in is the ""inciting incident"" that starts one of my all time favorite movies (the book is wonderful as well).

In post WWI England, 2 women (well played Josie Lawrence and Miranda Richardson) find this ad.  They each connect to the ad, and then they connect to each other as well.  This starts the awakening, that eventually leads all who experience this place (the Italian Castle of San Salvatore) to have a deep and profound transformation.

The cinematography is very rich, and the mood is very quiet.  The movie is actually a metaphor for the process that the characters go through (awakening and transformation) because watching the movie leads you (the watcher) through this very same process.  I don't think it is possible to really watch this movie and not be affected.

This is a very well constructed film.  The cast is marvelous, the cinematography breath-taking, and the music is very moving.  It is amazing how little is actually said in the movie, and yet how much more is actually communicated because of this.

This is one of the few movies I have ever seen, where I found that the one change they made for the movie, that differed from the book, actually made the story work better.  I greatly prefer to see Mr. Briggs as ""rather short sighted"" and therefore dependent on seeing how people are on the inside, to the original idea of ""infatuated by great beauty.""",1193011200,,2037,6.130281690140845
2347721,5,B000A0GYUU,"This movie is, quite simply, a classic. Imagine my surprise when I discovered, upon seeking for a DVD copy to gift a friend who has been ignorant of it all these years, that DVDs of this excellent little gem are not to be had. That seems to be a trend, as several movies that are must-haves in my collection have not been released to DVD. I've been perfectly happy with my VHS copy for years but it can't last forever - I was astounded to discover how much it was worth.

But enough of the financial, practical side of this issue. Someone else said it well...when one is at the bottom spiritually, when the day is dark, when it is February and it has been spitting snow steadily for three days, THIS is the movie for you. I have wanted to go to Italy in the Springtime since I saw this movie in an art cinema when it first came out. It has always worked as a sinecure for depression for me (I found a $20 bill in the lobby the day I went to see it at the cinema!); the personifications of the four women at the heart of the story are absolutely superb. Lottie and Rose, the two caged-up housewives in post-war London, struggling to find some answer to the whys of life in charity work; the lonely old woman (played with great style by Joan Plowright), clinging to her memories of long-dead poets; and the bored, titled socialite (played well by Polly Walker), looking for a stimulus away from her stagnant, well-bred life full of ennui. They all stumble into an unlikely partnership in the renting of an Italian villa for a month and in that time learn more about themselves and the world they must live in than they ever thought possible. And the backdrop is stunning. I so want to visit this place.

With every viewing of this movie I feel a deep peace and contentment. Everyone within the confines of the story blooms. The setting - and the personal discoveries - are pure magic. I always feel rather as if I have just gone on holiday when I watch it. This is truly one of those movies that belongs on the shelf of every movie buff, if not for how good it makes you feel, at least for the excellent acting of every member of the cast. If it takes purchasing a VHS copy to enjoy it, by all means. I hope at some point, however, it gains DVD status.",1189382400,,2250,4.279342723004695
2347722,4,B000A0GYUU,"ENCHANTED APRIL is a very pensive and subtle approach to the awakenings of love for the disenchanted. Vacation does wonders for four women from London who rent an Italian ""castle""  in Post WW1. What also happens is the awakenings of their husbands and other men to ""complete"" the couplings. Sometimes vacations awaken love and then it languishes, but others will bloom and grow like the oleander and survive the stresses of returning to London. It always seems that Italy is the cure! (hence UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN).

The performances from all principles are uniformly wonderful. IMO the movie, though a good one, still pales beside the stage play version which delves far deeper into the psyches of each character and their situation;whereas the film presents the gorgeous Italian countryside views which sacrifices some of the more substantial aspects of these delicious characters. Still, it is the only filmed version of this story. I do recommend,though, seeing the stage play if you can.

The vhs print is perfectly adequate. The PAL dvd is identical as the exact same print is used with no color restoration; and if an American release happens, no doubt it will be similar. Don't toss your tapes aside folks until something better comes along!",1189036800,,1248,5.019323671497585

2347756,5,B000A0GYUU,"This is such a delightful movie, uplifting and poignant. The story revolves around four women - two unhappily married women [played by Josie Lawrence & Miranda Richardson], a curmudgeon of a widow [Joan Plowright], and an upper-class disenchanted beauty [a luminous Polly Walker, most recently seen in the HBO mini-series Rome]...all four co-rent a beautiful Italian palazzo for a month circa the 1920s. Josie Lawrence acts so convincingly in her role that you truly believe in the magic of the place & time, and that life does not have to be complicated unless one wants it to be. Miranda Richardson plays her role as the uptight wife of an author quite well, with great facial expressions that give us a glimpse into her emotional upheaval. Joan Plowright is delightful as the grumpy widow, and Polly Walker is convincing in her role as a jaded aristocrat.

The men in this movie are definitely just supporting characters, but each one, from the guy that plays the owner of the palazzo, to Jim Broadbent's author, and finally Alfred Molina's stuffy solicitor  are significant in enhancing the plot. The cinematography is simply beautiful, evoking the lushness of the Italian landscape, and the uplifting tone of the movie definitely makes this a must-watch, especially for those of us who have moments when our spirits are flagging.",1183766400,,1334,5.031674208144796

It's captivating, has breathtaking scenes, and excellent performances by superior actors.  The story line is uncomplicated, during a time when life in England was far from uncomplicated.

It was a rainy afternoon - I was staying at school for spring break and I went down to the basement of the library to the AV room to watch it.  I went to school in Ohio - but for that hour and a half, I was transported to this wonderful place.  I've never forgotten this movie.  Italy looks beautiful.  Since then, I've been three time and there are places just like this.  The story of these four women is subtle and sweet.  It is a quiet gem of a movie.  The cast is inspired and I love Michael Kitchen (who can be seen in Foyle's War).  I'm lucky, I now live in New Zealand, so the Zone 4 is not a problem.

It has incredible scenery and is romantic. Very good acting by all. Heart warming and lifting.",1165881600,,500,4.273684210526316
2347788,5,B000A0GYUU,"This wonderful movie doesn't just tell a terrific story, it is a parable with deep psycho-emotional - and if you are willing to see them, even spiritual - implications.  What does it mean?  I don't want to spoil your fun by spelling it out in too much detail, but let me give you a few hints.

When the movie begins all the major characters - and there are a number of them, for this is an ensemble piece in which several characters are of more or less equal importance - are seen to be suffering from that almost universal affliction of fallen man, broken relationships.  Each is, in his or her own way, either lacking the relationships they desire or unable to relate successfully to the most significant other in their lives.  As a result, they are all more or less miserable, as Lottie Wilkins says to her newfound friend Rose Arbuthnot early in the movie.

The story this movie goes on to tell is essentially about how all this brokenness gets healed.  Thematically that puts it in the same class with some of my other favorite movies, like A Christmas Carol (I prefer the old black & white Alistair Sim version) and Groundhog Day.  Although less obviously than those two, Enchanted April is also a bit of a fantasy, for it takes some powerful magic to get these unhappy people out of their deeply entrenched ruts, just as it took magic (or would you prefer to call it divine intervention?) to save Scrooge and Phil Connors the weatherman.

In this case the magic is provided by a place:  A castle in Italy called San Salvatore.  But the fantasy is deeply rooted in reality, and we have no trouble believing that at San Salvatore anything really is possible, even that all these miserable people would find the healing and happiness they long for in one miraculously ""enchanted April.""  For anyone with whom this theme resonates, the movie thereby provides not merely a happy ending, but one that is truly joyful.

Another thing that makes this movie a treat to watch is that it is full of wit and good humor.  Much of it is rather subtle, but if you don't laugh out loud numerous times either you are not paying attention or your sense of humor is very different from my own.  Be sure to watch for the hilarious little sermon fragment in an early scene, which is easy to overlook but priceless if you catch it.

It also doesn't hurt that Enchanted April is marvelously written, acted, and directed.  Tom Keogh's editorial review mentions a ""particularly sensitive"" performance by Alfred Molina, and a ""very funny one"" by Jim Broadbent.  I agree on both counts, but hasten to point out that even these are surpassed by the brilliant performance of Joan Plowright, for which she deservedly received a Golden Globe award and an Academy Award nomination.  The cinematography is also of the highest quality, particularly the gloriously beautiful scenes set in sunny Italy.  These would be even more beautiful on DVD, and it seems disgraceful to me that this terrific movie has not yet been released in that format!

In conclusion, I can only add that while both my wife and I could mention a great many movies we have enjoyed over the years, we both agree that this one is our absolute favorite.  If you haven't seen it yourself, and if anything I have said makes you suspect you might possibly enjoy it, or has even piqued your interest in any way, I encourage you to see it as soon as possible.  It may not be easy to find at your local video store, but I urge you to make whatever effort it takes.  I'm almost certain you won't be disappointed!",1162857600,,3548,4.5775316455696204

How sweet all things would seem

Were we in that kind land to live together,

And there love slow and long,

There love and die among

Those scenes that image you, that sumptuous weather.""

Charles Baudelaire

Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, ""Enachanted April"" can be described in one sentence - it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - an ultimate ""feel good"" movie is perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone.

Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, ""Enchanted April"" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality.",1150329600,,1618,4.4425675675675675

All in due time, each character finds a way to eventually renew existing relationships as well as begin new ones--which  only transpires once in magical Italy of course...  I have never watched a movie this many times and yet I still find it as joyful to watch as the first time . It is sweet and gentle , humerous and magical...
Not to mention I have all of my beautiful Italia to look at!

It truly takes you away from your troubles and puts you in 19th Century England, with horse-drawn carriages, long dresses, gorgeous scenery and many, many flowers.  How can you not like it?

Four women of different cultural status share an Italian villa for the month of April.  They learn strengths and weaknesses of themselves and of each other.  It's springtime in Italy!  The plot is so wonderful, I don't want to give it away.  It truly deserves to be discovered by each viewer for themselves.

2347842,5,B000A0GYUU,"I love this movie because it's such a mood enhancing experience.  Whenever I think of this movie I immediately feel dreamy and relaxed.  I've had music CD's transport me like this but I'm just trying to remember if there is another movie that makes me feel this way, but nothing comes to mind.  Enchanted April explores the tension and desperation that rules the lives of  two of the main characters.  You find yourself longing for them to be free from their confining lives.  All four women in this film are badly in need of change (although one is too obstinate to realize that she needs change) and finally find themselves going through a magical transformation when they share an Italian villa named San Salvatore for a few weeks in April.  This movie has charm, humor and most of all magic.

  Set in the 1920's a time of huge change from women's repressed attitudes and dress we witness the changes come about in Rose and Lottie (played by Miranda Richardson and Josie Lawrence) who initiate the getaway but find they need financial assistance to pull it off. Rose is a wife whose husband (Jim Broadbent) writes risque novellas much to her dismay.  This causes a riff between them especially since her husband spends much of his time way from her.  Alfred Molina plays Lottie's tight fisted husband who oversees her every move to make sure she is the model wife to advance his business ventures. Lottie and Rose decide to solicit two other women to share in the adventure but get more than they bargain for when rich continually sought after Flapper, Lady Caroline  (Polly Walker)  joins in along with Mrs.  Fisher, an overbearing older woman (Joan Plowright) whose only friends are the great dead authors who her family knew as she was growing up.  Although Rose and Lottie find Lady Caroline intriguing and awe inspiring because of her free thinking attitudes, bobbed hair, short hemline and  modern actions, it soon becomes evident that there will be a collision of personalities when old and new (Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline) refuse to mix just like water and oil.  The personality clashes are laced with many funny yet charming exchanges within the group.

Somehow, someway the beautiful San Salvitore and it's springtime allure cushions the conflicts and eases the minds of all of the women one by one. Opposites in fortunes and attitudes become equals and their hopes, wishes and longings seem to come to fruition.  All of their harried thoughts, troubles and memories that have confined and confused them are coaxed away.  It's almost as if you are taking in the fresh air yourself and infinite beauty right along with the women and those they come to love and rekindle their love with.  The entrancing, picturesque film is enhanced by the high strings and soothing oboe solos in this very pretty soundtrack.  I adore watching this movie on cool sunny spring mornings with a light breeze blowing through my open windows.  This is a wonderful film that is indeed Enchanting and lives up to it's title beautifully!",1145923200,,3028,4.823643410852713
2347853,5,B000A0GYUU,"This is a great film for those dreary western Montana winter days. The sun is shining in Italy. The flowers are blooming.

2347854,5,B000A0GYUU,"I absolutely adore this marvelous, whimsical film.  When I saw this in the theatre when it came out ages ago, I didn't want to leave - I wanted to linger and bask in the springtime Italian countryside among my lovely new friends just a little while longer.  Mike Newell somehow creates a charming film featuring four women escaping from and then welcoming the men in their lives without resorting to maudlin tear-jerking tactics.  I love that.  The pace of the movie follows the emotional state of the holidaymakers.  We start off wistful, harried, restless, and unfulfilled, and almost without noticing become quietly joyous, relaxed, and renewed.  It's like a spontaneous hug from your best friend who you were too busy to notice you haven't seen in ages.

If there's anyone reading this who is somewhere in the chain of command that could lead to this film being released on DVD in NTSC format, I beg you, please push this one through.  It is a wonderful work of art, and deserves to see the light of day in the currently favored media format.",1144886400,,1046,4.708791208791209
2347855,5,B000A0GYUU,"But that was on HBO. Having read the other reviews, I would not purchase this Australian format, but I would buy it on regular
DVD if they ever issue that kind of copy. It never gets boring; with each viewing I noticed more and more about the artistry of the film: Miranda Richardson asleep with a gecko(?)running across her face, and her tongue protruding to wipe off a drop of sweat. The gorgeous Polly Walker(heavy flapper make-up hides her intense beauty in this movie)walking in the moonlight, appearing
lonely and somewhat sad that an unwanted suitor has fallen back in love with his wife. The hesitancy and then mutual pleasure between Walker's and Michael Kitchen's characters, as they find each other in the night among the gardens.  And, of course, the
formidable Joan Plowright melting in the warm hands and heart of
the formerly passive and unhappily married character, played by the actress, Josie Lawrence. I'm not sure if most men would fall in love with this film, as so many women have.  Harrison Ford is not in even one scene.
 Two of the three actors who play the male protagonists I find quite unattractive physically, and  play rather snivelly roles. I found it difficult to relate to the two unhappy marriages being magically renewed by the visit to this Meditteranean seaside village. But all in all, the film is lovely, and I felt inspired to go back to Italy for a third time. The setting
certainly can make one long to go to this extraordinarily beautiful country and find one's own Portofino. I would purchase a copy of Enchanted April so I could renew my acquaintance with the film occasionally, but not unless and until a usable DVD is issued.",1144108800,,1672,4.7353951890034365
2347856,5,B000A0GYUU,"This is one of those movies that you may never have heard of before, know the actresses from somewhere, decide to give it a try and end up loving it.

The movie starts in a trolley, filled with sneezing and coughing passengers, on a winter's day in 1920's London. One of the female passengers spots an ad from someone else's newspaper for an Italian castle that is available for rent for four weeks.

The woman becomes obsessed about renting the villa.  As she gathers three other women to join her, we learn that she is shy and kept down by an overbearing husband.  The other women, who have never met before and are of various ages, are also stuck and unhappy. Together, they rent the villa, where they try to figure out their lives.

""Enchanted April"" avoids becoming a sappy, cliched movie by capturing so well the women's frustrations in London. But although they are in depressing situations, the witty British dialogue keeps the pace from getting too slow or the viewer from getting depressed, though some of their situations are likely to hit a chord.

Then the switch to beautiful Italian scenery, where the women begin to feel better about themselves and sweep you along with them.  A lush soundtrack also adds to the pleasure.

2347861,5,B000A0GYUU,"This film is a beautiful and extremely faithful rendering of a lovely book.

  It begins with a cast that is talented and dead perfect.  Josie Lawrence as the somewhat loopy romantic, Miranda Richardson as the ""disappointed Madonna,"" Joan Plowright as the stuffy, controlling dowager, and Polly __ as the lovely Lady Caroline, searching, even though she doesn't know it.

  The story takes you from the humdrum, drizzly life of the city to the luxurious splendor of an Italian villa on the sea.  Reading the book is like taking a vacation, and so is the film.  But it is not only the location which refreshes, it is the gradual infusion that Josie Lawrence spreads, of hope, and the feeling that no good thing is impossible if people would just believe in it.

  Personally, at one twilight moment when ""In the glow of twilight"" is playing on a gramaphone, I always cry, because it is a beautiful moment of reconciliation, but also because my grandfather used to whistle and hum that song.  Now that I have heard the words, I realize he must have been singing it for/to my grandmother.

  The production values are top notch in every respect, from the crowded ""art parties"" where Lady Caroline is cloistered, to the suffocating Victorian darkness of the home of Miranda Richardson's character and Joan Plowright's.

  The men are equally stupendous.  You may recognize the star of PBS's Foyle's War, as the suprise love interest that sweeps us away with his mistakes and his nearsightedness.  Alfred Molina blossoms from gruff to sexy as Lottie's stiff husband.  This ultimately is about regular everyday love... not just between mates, but between ""mates"" - friends.  It lifts us to a higher place where love makes even magic possible.

  This is one of my top 5 favorite films.",1139788800,,1779,4.846666666666667

2347885,5,B000A0GYUU,"Mike Newell's film casts a seductive, mesmerizing spell on its audience.  I strongly encourage you to see it if you have not.

Josie Lawrence leads a strong cast as Lottie Wilkins, a dowdy London housewife who we meet in the film's first frames trudging through post-WW I London.  We meet Alfred Molina as her overbearing husband, Mellersh, who eyes all relationships as potential business opportunities, and sees his wife as not much more than a pet.

Lottie is riding on the bus in the dreary rain one day when she sees an advertisement on the back of the paper for an Italian Castle to be let for the month of April among the ""Wisteria and Sunshine"".  Lottie's life hasn't allowed her much love or friendship, but she decides that she MUST take this April Holiday at San Salvatori.  She approaches Rose Arbuthnot, who she barely knows, but has seen looking sad at Church services.

Rose is played by Miranda Richardson in a performance that suggests, if anything, that she has had her happiness even more suppressed than Lottie.  Her husband, Arthur, is played by Jim Broadbent in full ruddy-faced glory.  Arthur is a hedonistic author who writes pulpy trash novels with names like ""Theodocia, the Slave Princess"".  He also chases after other young women who come closer to meeting his ideal of fun than his pious wife.

Lottie and Rose secure the rent of the villa and decide to advertise for a couple of other ladies to share the expense.  Joan Plowright plays Mrs. Fisher, an older lady who grew up bouncing on the knee of the great English Poets of the day.  Blundering Lottie asks ""Oh, did you know Keats?"" a century and a half after Keat's day.

""No"", Mrs. Fisher replies with disdain.  ""And I didn't know Shakespeare or Chaucer either.""

Polly Walker is the poster-girl of the group as Lady Caroline Dester, daughter of an extremely rich and aristocratic English Lord.  Caroline moves in the most social of circles, but she has grown tired of being around men who paw and grab after her.  She just wants a little time to ""smooth her feathers"".

Michael Kitchen plays George Briggs, the owner of the Italian Castle.  Mr. Briggs is something of a mystery, as it appears that he is a wealthy English businessman, but he is also a gifted musician in addition to owning an Italian Castle, complete with a full staff.  He is extremely short-sighted and doesn't bother to keep his immediate surroundings tidy.  His few scenes are among the best of the movie.

These 4 ladies converge upon the Italian Castle and there... magic happens.  I could go into detail, but I'd spoil you the pleasure of finding out for yourself.  There are several times when the plot throws a wrench into the works, and in a different, lesser story, the movie would have degenerated into hysterical ""drama"".  The way this film reveals and resolves these confrontations is like.... a breath of fresh Italian breeze through the Wisteria.  I would ask only that you consider the shots of the moon in the penultimate scene - consider what the size and location of the moon means with regard to the tone of what is happening in the scene in the foreground.  It is delightful.

If you can watch ""Enchanted April"" and not be charmed I feel truly sorry for you.  It is on my very short list of very favorite films.

After years inexplicably not in release on DVD, it is finally available.  Cheers!",1123459200,,3368,4.6848381601362865

Unfortunately this DVD edition is a cheap Mother's Day knockoff. It appears to have been mastered from the VHS edition with absolutely no adjustments or enhancements of any kind. It's hard to imagine the VHS edition being worse. The menu screen, which is barely necessary, is actually ugly - a considerable feat when this film is bursting with beautiful imagery. The picture is grainy, fuzzy and full screen with poor contrast and saturation.

If you love this film don't sully it's memory with this travesty.

Why is it when ""Braineating Zombies from the Planet of Rancid Puss"" can get the royal DVD treatment, cinema gems like 'Enchanted April' get treated so shoddily? Sadly we all know the answer to that question...",1121299200,,851,4.862068965517241
2347908,5,B000A0GYUU,"Enchanted April is simply a wonderful film, filled with quiet romance and the mystery of life and love. Watching this film is like watching a beautiful flower bloom from the most miniscule, dew covered bud. There is a charm and warmth found here that is sadly missing in film today.

When an ad is placed in the paper offering a vacation of wisteria and sunshine at a castle by the sea in Italy, two Englishwomen with only a passing acquaintance from church, Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Rose (Miranda Richardson), leave their mates behind to join two other women for an April to remember.

The two other women are as different as night and day, yet will be affected by their surroundings in the same magical way. Joan Plowright is delightful as the elderly Mrs. Fisher, who begins to live again under the spell of wisteria and sunshine. But it is beautiful Polly Walker's portrayel of Caroline Hester, with her magic eyes and Louise Brooks look, that nearly steals the show.

The internal musings of Lottie and Rose, meanwhile, prompt both women to do the unthinkable and send for their husbands. This brings about some humorous and unexpected events to this April on the Riviera.

Just as in the gentle and beautiful novel, each will begin to find inner happiness and a rebirth of love. Very few films have the ability to sooth the soul and leave you feeling good about life like this magical film. Take your own enchanted holiday by picking this up as soon as you can.",1120867200,,1470,4.664092664092664
2347909,5,B000A0GYUU,"There is not a lot to say that hasn't been said about this movie. It rates in my top 5 all time favorites. I have everything from the Die Hard collection to Godzilla, but this is the DVD I'm waiting for. I like art-house, and pretty much anything that is good, and that has style. This movie is great and has a lot of style. The characters have been brought back through time, the acting is superb, the scenery is stunning. The opening scenes portray a dreary England: Dismal weather and almost desperate people. All that changes in the second part of the film. The characters find a new zest for life and leave Italy much happier people. Only a machine could not be warmed, even a little, by this movie.

2347910,5,B000A0GYUU,"Four very different women decide to escape their everyday lives and have a vacation in an exotic locale, in this turn-of-the (20th) century movie.  In a lighthearted but meaningful way, the movie interweaves  two main themes. One is getting a different perspective on your daily petty annoyances when you are physically removed from familiar surroundings and people. The second theme is friendships between (sometimes unlikely) women. The costumes are ethereally lovely and the pace of the movie speaks to a gracious bygone era. There's not much ""action"" here. The tone of the movie is very relaxing. This is a movie with inter-generational appeal, a lovely finale to a summer family get-together at grandma's.",1112745600,,710,5.274336283185841
2347911,5,B000A0GYUU,"In my top ten of Most Beloved Movies, this one rates very, very high. It's a movie about unhappy people. They are unhappy because they've closed their minds, indeed their whole beings, from being happy. Lottie feels her husband doesn't truly love her, and as a consequence refuses to love him. Rose disapproves of her husbands work (he writes racy novels) and tries to lose herself in her Church and Helping The Poor. Her husband, as a consequence drifts further and further away from her and casts roving eyes elsewhere. Rose and Lottie meet over a newspaper ad about a castle in Italy which is for rent for the month of April. To cut costs they advertise for two other women to join their holiday, away from home and husbands. The two other women are mrs Fisher, an old crusty lady who seemingly has no friends, just the memories of beloved and literary friends of the past, who've all died, and Lady Caroline Dexter, a raving beauty who tires of all the men that are always fighting for her attentions (whilst she still grieves for a man who died in the War - the First World War, that is)

Any American movie, to which even we in Europe are starting to get conditioned to, would give Lottie and Rose Italian lovers, or would insist they'd divorce their husbands. What makes this movie so delightful is that none of this happens. All four women end up very happy, not because of some outside reason but because they themselves open up to the people around them. They find out that, in order to be loved, one should be lovable herself. And it turns out that the menfolk are not the horrid, cold or roving monsters they were made out to be. Rose's husband, confronted with a Rose who doesn't reject him or his livelihood, practically throws himself in her arms. Lotti's husband will never be a dashing charmer, but he, in his own quit way, does love her, finds her beautiful. ""Why couldn't I see it before?"", he asks her. Mrs Fisher bursts open and finds out that all her old friends have one great disadvantage: they are all dead. ""I want the living"", she decides. And Caroline? Caroline finds somebody who doesn't care about superficial beauty and is finally freed to love. Each and every one of the characters blossom. Yes, Italy is beautiful after dreary London, but what really changes is not the scenery but the way the characters think and percieve themselves. They are no longer victims of their own lives, but actors. They free themselves to love and to be loving. Every time I need to be cheered up, this movie does the trick.",1112054400,,2537,4.56359649122807

The characters are very real, and you fall in love with each of them as they discover themselves and grow.

There are many, many wonderful moments in this movie, but here are two I especially prize:

Lottie and Rose have left a rainy, dreary London, and arrive in Italy at night amid even worse weather. Rose asks, ""How is this different?"" and Lottie replies,""Well, this is ITALIAN rain."" What a wonderful attitude- You just have to laugh!

Another moment has Rose discovering her estranged husband softly snoring in one of the rooms. She awakens him, and as he opens his eyes, smiles and says her name, there is no doubt in your heart that he truly, truly loves her. What a lovely, and very subtle moment, captured on film.

This is the perfect movie for a rainy afternoon, or if you are feeling just a little ""blue"". I have watched it often under these circumstances, & it never fails to give me the ""Warm Fuzzies ;-)",1099180800,,1094,4.4278606965174125

I've shared it with various family members who loved it as well.

The transformation of both the wives and husbands is funny, sad and moving.  The movie has a magical, soothing quality about it.

Starting out it's like going to work on a rainy Monday morning.  By the end of the movie it's as if you've been handed a bunch of Fridays - you will be that enthused.

In fact, that is, in my opinion, the sincerest and most lasting way to convey it.  This movie will be (is) a classic.  It will retain it's merit and devoted fan base for decades to come, passing from one ""enchanted"" generation to the next.

2347963,5,B000A0GYUU,"There's a lot of humor in this film, much of the humor is subtle, and some of it is obvious. For example, some intellectual humor where the simple-minded but endearing Lottie asks the stuffy old woman if she knew Keats, a poet who had been dead for over a hundred years! Or the scene where she's trying to get permission from her husband to go to Italy with her friend.. that whole scene is priceless, very funny. As far as obvious humor, one example would be her husband having a rather... explosive... accident while he's taking a bath!... and then he comes out half-naked and charred only to be met by the old woman!! You'll laugh :)
AS you can imagine, this film is a satire or lampoon of the attitudes and mores of the 1930s which is when this story takes place. But don't worry, it's not a stuffy old boring period piece--far from it! This is an immensely enjoyable and accessible film that will really delight you. Very easy to follow and enjoy, very amusing and funny.

I have read the book and the film follows it closely, though the biggest change is in the character of Mr. Briggs, the owner of ""San Salvatory"". Most guys would shy away form this type of film. Pity that they do, but understandable.
Watch this film on a rainy day, sunny day, cloudy, cold day, anyday when you want to go away for a quick holiday to Italy. It's worth every second.",1075248000,,502,4.408602150537634
2347965,5,B000A0GYUU,"I'm a guy. I love action. My DVD Collection is filled with mostly Matrix, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Lord of the Rings type movies. I crave violence, guns, fast cars, hot chicks, and super expensive Special Effects!
So why am I reviewing this movie that has absolutely nothing to do with any of the above? Because I also looooove a good vacation!! And even though this movie is about two women who take a holiday in Italy, that's not what I was referring to. ACTUALLY WATCHING this little movie is literally like taking a mini-vacation!!
I've seen this movie in theatres and had it on VHS at one time (recorded from cable) and I came on here hoping to find it available on DVD. Sadly, tragically it's not, but hopefully it will be soon. I read some of the reviews of this and I must say every single one (positive one anyways) is spot on. If you're wondering whether or not to get this, I'd say trust what you read here and take a chance. You won't be sorry. In this review I won't give any spoilers or much plot details. Because this movie is so much more than a mere plot...
Whether it's a cold rainy day, or too much is going on in life, or you've watched one too many action movies lately, or for ANY reason at all, grab a bowl of popcorn, a pillow and your favorite blankey, have a seat and pop this movie in. And then prepare to be healed! ;)
The experience of watching this movie is like this: It starts of gray and dreary, kinda like how things in your life may be going. The plot is wonderfully simple and very easy to follow, while engaging enough to immediately cause you to be concerned and interested about the main characters. Basically two ""friends"" are sick of how things are going and want to get away. Then after a while you are whisked away to this scenic, majestic world of peaceful serenity and mysterious beauty, and to this ancient Italian chateau, which actually becomes one of the stars in the movie. Once you're there, you are comforted, catered to, entertained, intrigued, and overally refreshed! The movie's slower than snail pace in this colorful otherworld, while retaining it's magical engagement suddenly casts a spell on you before you even know it, and you find yourself absorbed, relaxed, and essentially ON VACATION! As the movie winds up and things get resolved, the rest of the cast of characters comes in and things get a little rompous. But it never breaks its hold on you and you really get a kick out of some of the resulting scenes! And at the end what seals the whole experience before returning you back to your life is a small bit of the only special effects in the movie concerning a certain ""tree"". The last bit of magic in a fully magical movie. As you return to life you feel as though your soul has taken a holiday and you feel supremely good!
Now for me, that's about the time to pop in another 007 DVD!!
This movie, as you can see, is a rare treat and has an even rarer enchantment within it. There is simply no other movie like it and you owe yourself at least a viewing! You will be enchanted... Enjoy!",1071705600,,3059,4.396825396825397

2347987,5,B000A0GYUU,"The cover is a really horrible way to judge this film.  I did judge it by this method (as I do most things) for months before I was perusing my local video store's library with a recent acquaintance.  She demanded we watch the film with her roommates (my long-time friends), so I reluctantly rented it.  It is horribly feminine, and I felt my masculinity threatened by it.  Nonetheless, the film was surprisingly enjoyable.  I doubt most men would enjoy the film, but I found it to be as enchanting to the audience as it was to the characters.
There was a certain sort of narcotic in the film that made me long to be in Italy, anywhere in Italy, to feel and to see the wonders of that mystical place that the English-speaking world so splendidly reports of.
The characters are varied in their social customs and ranks, but they all share the same desire to escape the world in which they normally reside to recoup.  An actress, an old woman, and two unhappy wives unite in a villa in Italy to learn from each and from the seaside estate for a month.  The hair comes down and the facades wear off, creating a family from strangers.
It is a lesson in learning to find relaxation in life and in keeping relationships are a greater priority than earning a living or keeping house or whatever.  Enchanted April is a magnificent film.",1062720000,,1328,4.481327800829876

It starts in cold and rainy London with two women who, in desperation with their unhappy marriages, rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. To afford it, they advertise and interview prospective candidates who will share the rent. Precious few respond, but off they go to an enchanted paradise where the mellow garden, sunshine, house, climate, food, ambiance cast their spells.
Then the men somehow appear, and you think, Oh Damn, now the spell is broken... But nooooo. It just gets better - and better - and better.

2348016,4,B000A0GYUU,"Sadly, Americans don't make movies like this.  It's tone is, at first, desparate... in both a frantic and resolved way... much like the two ladies who first appear in it: Rose Arbuthnot (played by Miranda Richardson) and Lottie Wilkins (played by Josie Lawrence).  The frantically desparate Rose finally convinces the prudish and woefully resolved Lottie (a church acquaintance only) to rent an Italian Chateau ""castle"" on the
Mediterranean and get away from their ho-hum husbands.  This castle being advertised in the local paper as available for the month of April --  Post war Italy being the problem for the castle owner here.

Rose and Lottie cannot afford the sum on their own so they advertise for and interview two other women to share the holiday with them.  Their partners on holiday ultimately turn out to be a very crusty old widow, played by Joan Plowright and a lonely, but beautiful aristocratic socialite who is too often left alone by her married lover.

The tone of the movie soon changes with the weather.  Leaving rainy England in Spring to awaken on sun bleached sheets and the sun nearly blinding you even through solid wood shutters... in Southern Italy no less!  Truly an escape we could all use right
now!  Rose gulps in the fragrance of the flowers, the salt air and the view from her room... not to mention the perfectly brewed cup of aromatic tea and morning crumpet.

LIVING LIFE as it should be in April in this well-appointed and pleasantly staffed castle is entirely without challenge.... even given the challenges.  All surmountable, be assured.  But I can't give them away here.

Given the different tastes, styles and preferences of these four ladies, it appears that the castle has plenty of room for them to grow... and bloom... again.

Warm, sunny days, languishing seaside and napping for many hours in the splendid Italian meadows and mossy rocks -- all have a soulful effect on the quartet, and then on the men in their lives who make a surprise visit along with the castle's owner.

Chick flick?  YES!  But my husband enjoyed it as well. Attention all men!  If you want to earn major points and change the mood of your overwhelmed woman, bring home some flowers and this movie... serve with a warm cup of tea and honey or glass of red
wine.",1044576000,,2282,4.760814249363868
2348017,5,B000A0GYUU,"This is my favorite movie of all. I watch it at least once a month, sometimes once a week. Watching this movie is like taking a mini-vacation. Turn on the VCR, put up your feet, and take at trip to paradise.
Two women in post-war England decide to run away from their responsibilities and husbands for a month. They rent a villa (""a kind of castle, really"") in sunny Italy. Both women are short of funds, so they advertise for two others to share the holiday. A sleek, young ingenue and a stuffy curmudgeon join them.  No men allowed. They wake up in paradise and their personalities unfold like the carpet of flowers on the hillsides, all in their own way and in their own time.
Watching this occur is soul-fulfilling. Watch for the scenes when Lottie opens the window out to her first view of her surroundings. After the night's storm, her face shows her utter disbelief. And when Ruth cries alone in the glade. Oh! I know those feelings! I know how that is! ""Delicious!"" The men in the film are wonderful and are there to strickly support the female cast. The music is also calming and beautiful - especially the oboe piece.
I wish I knew women like this. I wish I had their wardrobe. Okay, I wish I was in this movie!
A beautiful film to watch, cry, laugh, dream, and wish over. Lovingly directed, acted, slow as molasses in January, but that's why I like it. A lovely break from the crazy world outside. Enjoy!",1044230400,,1415,4.4423076923076925

2348021,4,B000A0GYUU,"This is the kind of movie that American studios loathe to make.  It has too much charm.  It was made on a shoestring budget and the major American studios seem to salivate at only the big budget type films.  It's a story about women.  It's a love story with no sex.  It's a remarkable movie, deftly directed by Mike Newell, with no major stars, yet it shines.
Each of the actors, from Alfred Molina to Joan Plowright to the little known but charming Josie Lawrence, give fine performances.  Based on the Elizabeth von Arnim novel, two repressed English women seek adventure and find it when they vacation in an Italian villa.  The villa seems to change everyone's mood and outlook in life.  It's similar in theme to ""A Room With A View"".
Shot on what had to be a shoestring production, the story, the actors and the camerawork more than make up for any limitations of budget.  The film tops off with a satisfying ending that will leave you in a mood quite the opposite of what most films do today.  When was the last time that happened?",1023926400,,1036,4.462765957446808

The only thing that comes anywhere close to it for 'feel good' rating is Room With a View, and perhaps Antonia's Line, which also makes me want to throw off my shackles and go Bohemian and barefoot through fields of lavender.

2348045,5,B000A0GYUU,"I bought this video in a sale for only .... And because it had received, as far as I know, very little publicity, I wasn't expecting much. But my word how it surprised me!
Two young women, Lottie Wilkins (Josie Lawrence), and Rose Arbuthnot (Miranda Richardson), bored with their unappealing husbands and feeling trapped in a dreary, smoky1920's London, in which it never seems to stop raining, decide to get away from it all to a castle on the Mediterranean - the very castle in fact in which the original novel on which the film is based was written. Advertising for two others to go with them in order to defray expenses, they find themselves having to settle for Mrs Fisher (Joan Plowright), an irascible old woman who claims to have been the friend of many distinguished writers all now dead (""Did you know Keats?"" asks the rather simple-minded Lotti while Rose cringes in the background. ""No! I didn't."" shouts Mrs Fisher. ""I didn't know Shakespeare or Chaucer either"" ), and Lady Caroline Dester, a glamourous socialite who sick and tired of men and their grabbing attentions, just wants, like Garbo, to be alone.
On the first morning when Lottie opens her bedroom shutters, the incredible beauty of the place with its sun, ocean, fresh-air and flowers, bursts upon her and instantly begins to work its therapeutic magic, not only on her but on all of them. From arriving dull, depressed and querulous, they become within hours, hopeful, optimistic and far more loving. Lottie startles and pleasantly surprises Mrs Fisher by actually kissing her, and even begins to remember what it was about her husband that she loved. She decides to send for him and persuades Rose to do the same. Lottie's husband comes - though not in answer to her letter but to see Lady Dester, he being one of the men she is trying to get away from. Finding his wife there comes as a complete surprise.
However, both husbands respond to their wives' now happy, loving natures and, as a consequence, again become lovable themselves. The owner of the castle
George Briggs, (Michael Kitchen) pays a visit and falling for Rose, is disappointed when her husband turns up. But he is not miserable for long. The magic of the place has also cast its spell on Lady Dester and seeing George's distress she seeks him out to offer sympathy - with predictable results. I am giving nothing away when I say that all are paired off at the end - except for lonely, irascible Mrs Fisher who now of course is lonely and irascible no longer.
Everything about this film seems to me perfect. I can think of nothing to carp about. There is much humour in the dialogue and everyone acts supremely well although I was most impressed by Josie Lawrence and Michael Kitchen. So subtle are the changing expressions that move across the face of Lawrence that you can almost read her thoughts. This is indeed a little gem of a film. It is certainly the best ... I have ever spent.",1005004800,,2930,4.669245647969052

Enchanted April is one of those stories that makes life seem good again. In the warm spring air of Italy, four very different Englishwomen cast off their doubts and their demons to become fast friends. The cinematography is grand, the locations enchanting (I think the movie was actually shot at the castle where Elizabeth von Arnim wrote the novel!), the costumes delightful, and the acting superb.

An advertisement in the paper promising ""Wisteria and Sunshine"" at an Italian castle catches her eye.  She seeks out another forlorn soul, Rose Arbuthnot, and convinces her to share this villa for the month of April.  Because of expenses, they are forced to also take in two strangers to share the load.  Joining them will be Mrs. Fisher, an elderly woman who is hoping to remember ""better times and better men,"" and the beautiful Lady Caroline who is tired of the constant attention she receives and longs for a restorative quiet time.  When they arrive it is still raining, but at least as one of them so aptly puts it, ""This is Italian rain.""  When morning dawns, the sun comes out and remains with them for the month.
Enchanted with the peace and tranquility of her new surroundings, Lottie longs to share her joy with her husband.  When he arrives, Lottie urges Rose to invite her husband as well, but Rose fears that her husband, an author of racy novels under a pen name, will not come.  Imagine her surprise when he shows up immediately.  Of course, the catch is that he had no idea his wife was there but was hoping to have a dalliance with Lady Caroline.
In the peaceful Italian sun, marriages heal, new love blossoms, and unlikely friendships are born.  The movie is light, filled with delicious humor and profound sentiments to stir your heart and soul.
Most enchanting of all may be the beautiful scenes filmed on location in Portofino.  This is a great movie for self-medication in the gloom of winter when you want to seek greener pastures or just plain wonderful any day.",987033600,,1700,4.70945945945946
