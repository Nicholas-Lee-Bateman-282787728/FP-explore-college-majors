3919186,5,B002EP8FDI,"I was lucky to stumble into this series from the first episode.  The Masters of Horror series had some great episodes in it, but there were some truly terrible ones as well.  That series left me a little disappointed in that there weren't more quality episodes.  Along comes Fear Itself, also created by Mick Garris, and I decided to give it a shot.  The very first episode I saw blew my socks off.  I quickly added it to my DVR programming, and eagerly awaited the next episode each week.  Through its short run on NBC, some of the episodes that stand out above the others are:
  Skin & Bones: Larry Fessenden does a great job of creating tension by letting the viewer know that something is terribly wrong, but keeps holding off from revealing too much too soon.  You know something is going to happen, but WHEN????  The lead character who has returned from a hunting expedition after being lost in the wilderness for days, but his family knows that something about him is very different.  The lead actor here does a great job at creating some truly creepy moments with the makeup and his facial gestures.
  Community:  This episode is reminiscent of The Stepford Wives (original edition).  The people in this neighborhood are willing to keep it perfect at ANY cost.
  In Sickness and In Health:  OK, imagine this; it's the day of your wedding, and you're the blushing bride.  You receive a note that tells you that the person you are marrying is a serial killer.  John Landis is at his best in this episode!!
  The Sacrifice:  OK, now this one was my favorite!!  Four people come upon this big fort out in the middle of the forest.  Once they enter, they can't get out.  Three mysterious sisters appear, and we keep thinking, ""Something is NOT normal about these girls.""  I don't want to give anything away, but there is definitely something abnormal about them.  I love the feeling of isolation and true helplessness the characters face as they are unable to leave this place.

There are four episodes that I'm not familiar with.  Either they were never aired, or I simply missed them.  They are, ""Chance"", ""The Spirit Box"", ""Echoes"", and ""The Circle"".  Unlike the Masters of Horror series that was more hit and miss with good episodes, Fear Itself steps out to provide one quality fright fest after another.  There is not a bad episode in the whole series.

I wish this series was available on Blu-ray, since it was originally broadcast in HD, but having said that, the picture on this DVD looks great.  There are four episodes that get the 'Director's Cut' treatment, and each episode has a nice little intro by the director.

My Views on the Set Itself:  I have to admit that this set snuck up on me.  I didn't realize it was in production, and was quite shocked when I saw it on the store shelf.  Of course the thing that helped draw my eyes to it is the packaging that resembles a three dimensional tombstone with a skeleton on the front.  I LOOVE the tombstone design here, but when I opened it, my elation turned to frustration.  I'm not crazy about double-sided DVD's, but I can live with it.  What I find appalling is the fact that TWO discs are held together on ONE hub.  The discs actually rest on top of each other, which opens it up for some SERIOUS scuffing.  I'm sure there could have been a better option that could have still held the set down below the $30 price line.  There are no inserts here, but on the back of the tombstone is a detailed list of the contents of each disc.

I would normally knock off a star or two for bad packaging, however, with this set I will make an exception.  Everything else about it is so perfect, that all of the positives outweigh the few negatives.  You get 13 episodes in anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, quality bonus features, and an AWESOME package and best of all.......It's less than $30.  Horror fans I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed with this great set.",1253491200,3,3950,4.55049786628734
3919187,4,B002EP8FDI,"A few years ago Showtime came across an idea that seemed to bear mixed fruit. The series was called MASTERS OF HORROR and what it did was take some of the top directors in the horror genre (including John Carpenter, John Landis and Stuart Gordon) and give them the opportunity to make an hour long horror piece of their choosing. Some resulted in truly inspired takes while others fell flat, like most episodes.

After a two year run the makers of the series took it to network TV at NBC and changed the name to FEAR ITSELF. The gore quotient dropped and of course most of the nudity as well, but the same idea and some of the same directors continued on. As with most anthology series, the episodes went up and down, good and bad. But for the most part, each and every participant delivered the goods.

This week Lionsgate is releasing the entire series of FEAR ITSELF on DVD. The series comes in an appropriate box shaped like a tombstone and the four discs included have some great things to offer scare fans. Consider it an early Halloween present.

The 13 episodes should find something for everyone from atmospheric pieces to out and out blood curdling, scream inducing chills. Directors include Stuart Gordon (THE RE-ANIMATOR), Mary Harron (AMERICAN PSHCHO), John Landis (AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON) and several others. Rather than discuss each one, here is the best and the worst.

Of the 13 the weakest was an entry called CHANCE starring Ethan Embry. It tells the tale of a man driven by failure and poverty to make a decision that results in catastrophe. When Chance (the character's name) tries to sell an antique pot to a dealer, he discovers he's been had having paid much more than the dealer is willing to offer. As he is driven to the edge of sanity, he continues to see himself but separate from his own body. The doppelganger lives out his wildest dreams of revenge, killing the dealer and taking Chance down a road he shouldn't travel.

As the episode unfolds, Chance has a hard time differentiating between reality and fantasy, never quite sure who is pulling the strings. Is it the double he sees committing these heinous acts or is it really Chance, his mind twisted by desperation? The answer is not quite satisfying and the episode feels like it takes too long to go nowhere. But most episodes aren't of this quality.

Instead they're like the best one, SKIN AND BONES, directed by Larry Fessenden (THE LAST WINTER) and starring Ball State grad Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from the HELLBOY films). The story opens with an angry teen about to head out to the mountains in search of his father whose been missing since he left 10 days earlier with a group of friends. When his uncle and lead ranch hand tells him to stay the pair has words and the uncle decides to head out. But there's no need when the man returns, beaten and frostbitten.

But the man isn't the same as when he left. Hollowed out cheeks and razor sharp teeth as well as an uncontrollable hunger for meat make everyone wonder what happened. His wife, brother, two children and an Indian who helps on the ranch all look at him differently. The Indian begins to tell his brother about his uncle who did the same thing. Returning from the mountains a rage had overcome him and he was possessed by the ""wendigo"", a spirit who takes over its host and lives on rage and destruction.

Come on! You know this thing is in him and an eventual showdown between various characters is bound to take place. But Fessenden builds the suspense and offers a few extreme jumps to the mix, giving us a taste of gore but counting more on the slow unfolding of the story to drawn us in and releases our adrenaline for a rush only a scare film can muster.

The rest of the pieces offered here are all quite well made and involving in their own right. Sad to say, the show wasn't picked up after this season and another anthology series bit the dust. But DVD comes to the rescue again so that you can watch it over and over or just discover what you may have missed when it first aired.

And remind them that the only thing they have to fear is...FEAR ITSELF.",1252368000,66,6588,4.646603611349957
3919188,5,B002EP8FDI,"If NBC wasn't such a bunch of pansies and keep this series going it would have attracted more and move horror but like all shows that seem to show something good they cut it down in it's prime.  FEAR ITSELF is another example of great shows killed for no reason.  This series is technically the third season to Masters Of Horror, created by Mick Garris the original creature of Masters of Horror but left the continuation of his dream series thanx to NBC wanting control as always.  I'm still surprised Heroes wasn't canned after the first season like with what they did with Surface and other shows of the past that got good attention.  I guess Heroes is one they played smart on for a first.  Wish they would do something Horror related again like Fear Itself...

I rated this item 5 stars cause I even though I don't own it yet, the show is worth it....And I will say the packaging looks very nice!",1252022400,6,901,4.430303030303031

Thanks to the Olympics, only one half was shown and the other half after, but by then, viewership dropped and even though a second season was promised, it was never fulfilled.  Out of the 13, I only had 9 favs.  With each episode, the timing was paced quite nicely and some of these stories you can get lost in them.  There were even some that had ending that I didn't see coming.  IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH, THE SPIRIT BOX & THE CIRCLE were perfect examples.

3919209,4,B002EP8FDI,"I am a fan of horror anthologies. I digested this first season (waiting for more) in about three days. Some of the stories are pretty neat, some of them are kind of off. One stands out as being entirely nonsensical (In Sickness and in Health). Something with Bite is a pretty fun episode, no spoilers. Skin and Bones, The Spirit Box and The Sacrifice are all decently good horror stories, and the rest of the episodes lie somewhere between meh and pretty good. Overall definitely worth the money and I know that I'll rewatch the series a lot, even the bad episodes.",1470700800,,565,4.549019607843137

Haunter is an excellent example.",1468886400,,304,4.545454545454546
3919211,3,B002EP8FDI,"First off, let me begin by saying I did enjoy this series as a whole. I watched the entire thing when it was available to stream on Netflix around 2010-2011. Like its sister show - Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" - it is a horror anthology with each episode being directed by a different horror filmmaker. While some episodes are not that great, there is enough here to warrant the purchase and addition to your DVD collection.

From the top of my head, the episodes ""Spooked"", ""Something With Bite"", ""Skin and Bones"", and ""New Year's Day"" stand out as fairly strong. On the opposite end of the spectrum, episodes such as ""Community"" and ""The Circle"" are just okay. Though your mileage may vary, as one of the strengths of this series as a whole is the variety. There are monster episodes, ghost episodes, and psychological episodes to meet any taste or preference.

There are also a few neat surprises I picked up on a second watch. A lot of the guest stars went on to bigger/better things since. You have Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olsen from Mad Men),  Charlie Hofheimer (Abe Drexler, also from Mad Men), Anna Kendrick, Jesse Plemons (Todd from Breaking Bad) and Lawrence Gilliard (Bob from The Walking Dead)  are spread out in various episodes.

Now, with all that said, let me explain my 3-star rating. The packaging LionsGate chose is absolutely ridiculous! What you get is four DVDs, three of which are double-sided and the fourth being a single side containing one episode. The DVDs are not labeled except for the little mark around the ring saying ""Side A"", ""Side B (Reverse)."" There is nothing on the case or an insert telling you which discs have which episodes - you have to play it to find out! Also, when the discs start you have to watch the same unskippable 30 second intro before the episode select option will even show up. The only bonus material is a 5 minute clip for each episode featuring the director talking about their episode. The copyright date on the back from LionsGate says 2016. Are you serious? Double-sided DVDs and no episode guide now? What the heck???",1466640000,10,2082,4.693150684931507

3919253,3,B002EP8FDI,"This show is clearly a 3rd season of Masters of Horror. It's got much of the same behind the scenes creative, it's the same concept, it uses some 'master' horror directors. However where as Masters of Horror had big names like John Carpenter and John Landis working on horror flicks, this one has Darryn Lynn Bousman and Mary Harron... it's a bit of a drop in quality is what I'm saying. It also has the problem of being a show made for NBC and not Showtime so there are greater restrictions in place here, every film feels like it's a pg13 horror film pretending it's more extreme than it actually is.

That's not to say this is a bad show, it's not. In fact it can be really good sometimes (The episode 'Community' probably ranking as one of the best in my opinion) but it's held back by the fact that it's not getting the names that the Showtime series had, and it has more restrictions on it's content, which does make things less scary. It's worth watching if you liked Masters of Horror, or are maybe wanting to try horror as a genre but want something that's a little tamer but other than that it's average.

3919259,1,B002EP8FDI,"As has been noted by other reviewers, Fear Itself is basically season 3 of Mick Garris's mediocre ""Masters"" of Horror series, and it's easy to see why his show keeps getting cancelled.  The series promises Mozart but can't even deliver Salieri.  Most episodes feel like they were written, acted, and directed by college film students who spend entirely too much time reading FANGORIA and not enough time learning their craft.

EATER (Directed by Stuart Gordon, Written by Richard Chizmar & Johnathon Schaech)
If you believe that ""gore = horror"" and are scared by long silences interrupted suddenly by loud noises (usually punctuated by equally loud bursts of music), then you may enjoy this episode.  As for me, the writing was so cliche and groan-inducing that I could hardly stand to watch more than 10 minutes at a time.  For instance, 3 grown men (all seasoned police officers, no less) are dispatched with ease by the killer, but the one rookie female cop is able to escape the killer's clutches again and again and again, yet she can't seem to figure out how to smash through a glass door to escape the building she's ""locked"" in.  The plot twists are so uninspired that anyone who has watched more than 3 horror films will see the twists coming a mile away.  The ONLY decent plot development occurred in the final 30 seconds, but the viewer is hardly given the chance to savor the moment before the credits role.  Prior to the finale, I kept staring at the clock to see how much longer the episode had left and wishing the killer would hurry up and kill everyone (and then kill himself) so I could move on to something more worthwhile, like clipping my toe-nails.  This episode just proves once again that Stuart Gordon peaked in 1985 with Re-Animator.  Such a shame.

SPOOKED (Directed by Brad Anderson, Written by Matthew Venne)
Anderson directed Session 9, which I thought was a respectably atmospheric horror film.  Venne's horror career consists mainly of writing forgettable sequels to mostly forgotten horror films (White Noise 2, Mirrors 2, the forthcoming Fright Night 2), as well as Mick Garris's lackluster adaptation of Stephen King's Bag of Bones.  Venne also adapted one of the better stories from MOH (PELTS).  In Garris's world, such credentials would qualify both Anderson and Venne for ""master of horror"" status.  As for SPOOKED, what little atmosphere the film generates in its first 25 minutes is quickly lost during the second half, which felt increasingly rushed, especially the finale.  The acting is decent in spite of the sometimes clunky dialogue and characterization, but much of the story's potential goes unrealized.  With a little plot tweaking and a slightly longer running time, it might have made a good segment.  Instead, it's as forgettable as most of Venne's other work, although perhaps in this case it's not his fault.  Or perhaps it is entirely his fault.  What difference does it make now?  The damage is done.

COMMUNITY (Directed by Mary Harron, Written by Kelly Kennemer)
Harron adapted and directed the much over-rated American Psycho.  Kennemer has virtually no film or television credentials to speak of.  COMMUNITY is sort of a take on Ira Levin's The Stepford Wives.  A comparison could also be made to the film Disturbing Behavior, not just in terms of plot but b/c both Disturbing Behavior and COMMUNITY are essentially a waste of time.  COMMUNITY takes Hillary Clinton's assertion that ""it takes a village to raise a child"" to a whole new level.  The episode is not bad, but neither is it very memorable.  Your time is better spent reading Levin's novel.",1356220800,,3612,4.9060955518945635

The first episode, ""Eater"", was really unnerving and the acting was excellent. The episode that really messed me up was ""Skin and Bones"". I'm terrified of the 'monster' in this tale, so I was huddled under the blankets, cringing. That's coming from someone who saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time when she was seven, and grew up reading Stephen King and Peter Straub from age twelve, up.

3919264,5,B002EP8FDI,"I really liked the series when it was on TV, but it was cancelled before all thirteen shows were broadcast. I believe they only showed 10 shows before the series was canceled, but NBC had paid to make 13. I bought this set partly to have a good copy of each show without advertising and also to see the last three shows.

The packaging with the tombstone is kind of cute, but the disks inside are not packed very well. There are four doubleside disks with two just stacked on top of each other on either side of the opened up tombstone. Normally I don't like double sided disks and I certainly didn't like the way they just stacked them on top of each other with nothing in between, but the disks are flat and smooth and very unlikely to scratch each other and they did put a rubber spacer in between to keep the two sides of the tombstone from rubbing on each other, so they should be safe enough as long as the set is not left sitting around with the tombstone case left open.

The main selling point of this set is the price. At fifteen dollars for the set, that's only a little over a dollar an episode. For that kind of money I can forgive the packaging and just enjoy the shows.",1335312000,3,1184,4.211453744493392
3919265,5,B002EP8FDI,"Produced by Lionsgate, apparently - a bad omen considering most Hollywood horror too often relies on nothing but cheap shocks (jump scares, excessive gore etc). Fortunately this time the directors were actually allowed to direct without interference from executives, with good results.

""Skin and Bones"", ""The Spirit Box"" and ""Community"" were consistently scary - something I have't seen since ""The Baby's Room"" last January. Although making action sequences scary is difficult and very few succeed, special mention should go to ""Skin and Bones"", in which the wendigo-possessed man, often seen lying in bed, apparently is quite tall, which combined with his frostbitten fingertips, thinness from starvation etc makes him appear quite inhuman and very intimidating.

3919271,4,B002EP8FDI,"Remember ""Masters of Horror""....it was an anthology show on Showtime where the biggest names in the horror genre (Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter etc.) created one-hour mini-movies?

""Fear Itself"" is the network TV version of ""Masters of Horror"". ""Fear Itself"" boasted quite a few big names producing one hour shows. And like ""Tales from the Darkside"", ""Nightmares and Dreamscapes"" or ""Tales from the Crypt"", the stories run the gamut of the horror spectrum, from creepy to horror comedy. And like most horror anthology shows dating back to ""Suspense"" and ""The Twilight Zone""..you get a mixed bag of results.

Actually, ""Fear Itself"" hits the mark more often than not, ""Eater"", ""Family Man"" and ""New Year's Day"" being particularly good. The writing was pretty solid, and even with the more humorous tales such as ""Something with Bite"", ""Fear Itself"" still manages to pack in some unexpected chills.

The vast majority of the material put out in this genre is B- or C-grade lackluster, derivative crap--and this includes most of the big-budget Hollywood offerings  as well.

Some of these episodes are better than others, but this is the kind of series I would love to see produced again.

3919276,2,B002EP8FDI,"""Fear Itself"" aired on NBC for a short time and did not finish its 13 episode run but it is very well written and I was sorry not to have seen every episode yet. But it does make it fun to watch the DVD set now. The main thing I want to let everyone know is to beware of the packaging it comes in. First of all these are four double-sided disks. I never liked double disks because they scratch very easily, it's difficult to tell which side you're on, and it's easy to put finger prints on them. Also, they are more likely to have problems playing on a DVD player. Simply put, they are very cheap. Secondly is that they packaged in such a way that the double sided disks actually are placed on top of each other with nothing at all protecting them. That is extremely irresponsible of the manufacturer and shows how little they care for their customers. Upon receiving my set I immediately rectified the problem myself, hoping that it's not too late already considering that they could already be scratched. I put each of the four disks in their own slimline DVD case and then got on the computer and made my own DVD label for the series. Then I put the four cases in the bottom cardboard part of the original set because they fit perfectly inside of it. I strongly recommend that everyone do the same. I think you may be sorry if you don't. Although I enjoy the series, I am giving it only 2 stars because the packaging is horrendous and inexcusable. I've never yet seen packaging this bad and I've bought many DVD sets in my time.
As for the show itself, it's actually season 3 of ""Masters of Horror"" just moved from SHOWTIME to NBC so the stories had to be shortened for commerecials and the nudity was taken out and the blood and gore was lessened. But that's fine with me. Horror does not mean lots of splattered blood. Horror should give you some chills, give you an unexpected shock. That's what some of these stories do. If you enjoy horror I think you should try this out.",1255392000,64,1980,4.339622641509434
3919277,5,B002EP8FDI,"FEAR IT'SELF

This is the now gone and cancelled series that once was called ""The Masters of Horror"" on Showtime, they cancelled and on to NBC I believe it was we were treated to this. You could call it MOH season 3 or by its actual title ""Fear It'Self"" but what ever you call it once more it is great. Creator Mick Garris continued what he was doing with the original show by having well known directors and writers do the episodes, I wish it would have been renewed. To me there is no better way to tell a story as far as TV is concerned then in the anthology format. It seems more fun to have a completely different story every week, really is there any type of show that is better?

The DVD release is kind of a mixed bag since the DVD placement is weird; it is one of those flip side style releases with episodes on each side. The thing is all four of the discs are put on top of each other with nothing in between, two on the right side of the case and two on the left so the packaging could use some work. Also another kinda weird thing is that the episodes are not put in the order they appeared on TV, but that is not really a big deal since you get every episode including those that were not aired. There is a little something here for everyone from the non stop bloody to the more ghostly like tales, I am pleased with all although some more than others.

Episodes

EATER-this is a personal favorite of mine about a cannibalistic serial killer who is finally appended by the police. Thing is he as the ability to become who ever he eats if he eats their heart before it stops beating. This one is full of suspense and blood and is very very entertaining. Directed by Stuart Gordon and written by Richard Chizmar & Johnathon Schaech this tale revolving around the eater and a rookie cop named Danny Bannerman. She has her work cut out for her on this night.

THE SACRIFICE-written by creator Mick Garris this is another insanely fun one filled with great atmosphere and some kind of creature, perhaps of the vampiric kind maybe a monster or even demon. This story follows a group of friends who are forced to hold up inside an old fort of some kind after an accident leaves one of their friends unable to walk. At this fort which apparently is the home of three beautiful young women who are sisters they have the worst night of their lives. This episode is directed by Breck Eisner.

COMMUNITY-once again we are blessed with another great episode although this one reminds me of a Twilight Zone episode for some reason. But this one follows a young married couple who move into the perfect neighborhood. The thing is they actually do move into the perfect neighborhood and the people who live there will do anything to keep it that way. Starring Brandon Routh, directed by Mary Harron and written by Kelly Kennemer this is another fun one with a great ending.

IN SICKNESS & IN HEALTH-directed by the great John Landis and starring two stars form one of my favorite shows ever ""Psych"" James Roday and Maggie Lawson, this one is a weird and crazy one. This one is about a couple who are about to get married when the bride to be receives a letter from a stranger that reads ""the person you are marrying is a serial killer"". Well what is a girl to do in this situation, watch and find out?

SPOOKED-this one is about a cop who once did some very bad things to some bad people and because of that lost his job. Now days he is a private eye who not only does his job but also turns on the client to make some extra money. Now he is hired by a woman who suspects some bad things about her husband, but during the stake out across the street from her house something strange is going to happen to him. This ghost story is written by Matt Venne, directed by Brad Anderson, and stars Eric Roberts.

THE FAMILY MAN-is possibly my favorite of all of the episodes because of the story and ending to it. This story directed by Ronny Yu and written by Dan Knauf is about a great family man who loves his wife and kids, and has a great job. But after a near fatal car accident with a killer he wakes up but not as him self. Turns out they have traded bodies and now they family man is going to prison for crimes he did not do. As for the killer he is taking over as the family man and living that life, with the guy's wife and every thing. Starring Colin Ferguson and Clifton Collins Jr. in possibly the best story on here.

NEW YEARS DAY-this crazy tale told by director Darren Lynn Bousman and writer Steve Niles is all about a girl that wakes up to a world over run by zombies and she has a hard time piecing every thing together. This is another one that has a wonderful ending and has a nice dark feel to it.

SKIN & BONES-this is another one that is up as a contender for best episode as writers Drew McWeeny & Scott Swan and director Larry Fessenden bring forth this tale of a Wendigo. For those who don't know it is a legendary creature most popular amongst Native Americans that lives in the harshest and coldest of places. In this story a man has been missing from his ranch for days when he finally reappears, but is he the same man that left or is he something a whole lot more sinister.

SOMETHING WITH BITE-written by John Landis's son Max and directed by Ernest Dickerson this one is about a pet vet who is bitten by something resembling a werewolf. As time goes on he stars to change and mostly for the better, or has he. This is a fun tale in the werewolf genre.

THE SPIRIT BOX-directed by Rob Schmidt and written by Joe Gangemi this ghostly tale is about two friends who try to contact the spirit world and stumble upon a message from an old classmate who died. This girl who committed suicide or so they thought is leading them to the person who may have killed her.

CHANCE- directed by John Dahl and written by Lem Dobbs & Rick Dahl this one is all about two that are one, if that makes any sense. What would happen if you meet the darker side of your self, this episode may just answer that for you. Another good episode that is worthy of this great collection.

ECHOES-is a wonderful episode about a young man that moves into a new place only to start having dreams about a man who once lived there. This man though was the opposite of our lead as he apparently was a murderer and his girl may have been one of the victims. As time goes on he starts to think he has more in common with this guy then first thought, and his girl may be in trouble. Directed by Rupert Wainwright and written by Sean Hood this is another like I said before fun one.

THE CIRCLE-this cool little tale is directed by Eduardo Rodriguez and written by Richard Chizmar & Johnathon Schaech is about the roles changing from fiction to fact real fast on a group of friends. The synopsis says it best, ""A group of people meet every Halloween to tell horror stories and suddenly discover they're living one."" Another good episode that all should enjoy.

Each episode comes with a behind the scenes feature or making of type deal and is great for all fans of the show. There is not any episode I dislike and in fact I enjoyed all of them but like I said some more than others. For those of you who love horror like I do I highly recommend this, and to those who may not really like horror this may get you into it. This is a wonderful set and I am a proud owner of it, buy it now if you have not already.",1255305600,18,7395,4.248221906116643

3919280,4,B002EP8FDI,"Unfortunately, I didn't have the time or discipline to watch this show when it aired on Thursday nights on NBC.  Only 8 episodes actually aired before it got cancelled.  Typical.  This show doesn't have a cast of youths(Supernatural, Buff the Vampire Slayer) and it's an anthology series which of late never seem to fair well.  Is it worth picking up if you've never seen it like me?  Yup it is, but surprisingly most of the good episodes did air.  Also, surprisingly the younger directors of the series(Fressenden, Boussman) outdo their elders with their direction and story.

Not all the old dogs do bad.  Stuart Gordon has the second best episode in Eater, about a lonely upstate jail playing storage to a Voodoo practicing cannibal.  But unfortunately two vets provide the shows weakest entries.  John Landis(American Werewolf in London, Animal House) gives the worst episode.  It's about a bride to be who gets a note that reads, ""The man you are about to marry is a serial killer.""  Fun premise with a singular location I was expecting some fun and witty Hithcock-like storytellings, but was very disappointed.  What I got instead was a poorly acted, stilted, and hugely predictable tale.  Landis does nothing in his direction to help Victor Salva's(Jeepers Creepers, Powder) script.  I was looking forward to Landis' entry.  His two Masters of Horror were pretty good.  Deer Woman being very funny and twisted, and Family just being twisted.  You'll forget his episode long before it's over.  The second worst could be connected Landis as well, Something With Bite.  It was written by his son Max Landis who also wrote the enjoyable Deer Woman.  It was also directed by Ernest Dickerson(Bones, Demon Knight, Juice).  At least with Dickerson at the helm I thought this werewolf tale would be at the least visually stunning, but wrong again.  Though KNB's werewolf creation is pretty cool and does get some decent screen time.  The whole plot is a retread of how good it is to be a werewolf, kind of like Teen Wolf, mixed with a whodunit murder mystery.  Is out lead wolf the culprit?  Who cares?  The script is so half baked and never really goes in with an real innovation or depth for it to be worth it.  The rest of the episodes are mediocre to really good.

The best episodes are as follows: New Year's Day, a zombie opus directed by Darren Lyn Bousman(Saw II-IV, Repo the Genetic Opera), Eater directed by Stuart Gordon(From Beyond, Stuck, Re-Animator, Dagon), and Feressden's(Wendigo)  Fresenden's episode is a basic possession tale with a great lead creep performance by Doug Jones(Hellboy I and II, Pan's Labrynth).  These are the three to watch immediately and make the set worth renting.  Now there are three other tales that are worth checking out, even if they're not great, they're greatly done and entertaining.  Dahl's film noir doppleganger thriller, with a great duel performance by Ethan Embry, is very well paced and directed.  It's only flaw has to do with the story's final outcome.  It's very by the numbers, but well done.  Mary Herron(American Psycho, The Notorious Bettie Page, I Shot Andy Warhol) directs another tale that is half-baked but very worth your while.  It's about a couple looking to start a family in the perfect suburb and end up getting more then bargained for.  Brandon Routh(Superman Returns) gives a very good performance.  Some of this episodes details regarding how the private community deals with those who break the rules are truly disturbing and unnerving.  Ronny Yu's sould swap with a serial killer tale is well done and suspenseful, but again, if it had been feature length it would've had more time to develop and been more satisfying.  Also, the ending seems to be a downer on the extreme without really earning it.

The rest of the episodes are not worth mentioning because they are fairly forgettable.  Though, all episodes are well acted and directed with the exception of Dickerson's and Landis'.  For each episode there's five minute behind the scenes segments revolving around the directors, similar to what you would find on the first season Masters of Horror DVDs.  They're fun, but if you're interested, make sure to watch them after the episode, they do contain spoilers.  I laughed to myself as the directors of each episode, except Stuart Gordon, all chime on and on about how horror doesn't need extreme violence or gore to be good.  Yeah, okay, guys.  It's just a sales pitch to get people who don't really like horror to watch the show.  True horror fans know gorier doesn't equal better, but we also know it depends on the story being told and the tone of the piece. BTW for an NBC show this anthology series is fairly violent and there are gory moments to be found in almost all episodes.  Stuard Gordon is the only one not selling and is actually frank regarding the limitations of fear storytelling on network TV.  Though, I've seen CSI episodes and other crime shows more violent then this horror show.  And it's more about the mood of intensity in regard to Standards and Practices.  If you create a harsh and oppressive mood it scares the PC police, makes 'em sad.  They want cuts made but they don't have a specific thing to cut.  They just don't like the feel.  Straight forward horror really can't fit on network TV in modern times, if you ask me.

Bottom line, you should pick this up.  It's worth the money for the episodes I mentioned.  You will be investing into owning some clunkers, but that's the case with almost all anthology shows.  Not every Twilight Zone, Tales From the Crypt, Tales from the Darkside, Amazing Stores, or Outer Limits was without their crappy episodes.  Check it out.",1253836800,7,5682,4.819875776397516

From the very first story it was atmospheric, creepy and, with a little gore for good measure inserted,certainly stands up against the likes of the tales from the crypt, creepshow & twilight zone franchises.
