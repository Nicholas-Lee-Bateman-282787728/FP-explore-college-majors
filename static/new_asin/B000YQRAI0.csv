3035081,4,B000YQRAI0,Very good as far as it goes.,1404950400,,28,3.142857142857143
3035082,4,B000YQRAI0,These videos are presented by the US War Office. Each part gives a simple and accurate description for those who are beginners in the study of military history or who want a quick introduction. These are not intended as in depth presentations. Original footage in this case is a bit graphic because of the Marine casualties sustained at Tarawa and Makin They encountered Japanese forces that were well entrenched and the fighting was brutal. Robert Sherrod narrates some of his own experiences with the Marines at Tarawa. Actually these are well presented.,1381017600,2,556,5.054347826086956
3035083,3,B000YQRAI0,Nothing that has not been seen before.  I have the highest respect for the Marines that walked in from the reef.  The bravery of those men is unbelievable.,1379289600,,155,4.5

3035086,5,B000YQRAI0,Nothing fancy about the show other than it has great real footage from the battle along with the real down and dirty reality of war. They also give you a breakdown of the assault and problems that took place.,1354320000,2,208,4.358974358974359
