8122222,5,B000FGG64I,"We learned Stephen Foster songs in Elementary School in the 1950s. I never forgot the music or Stephen Foster.

I got a really great deal on this DVD and IT WAS WORTH EVERY CENT.

Some small minded people might have issues with some of his lyrics but it was another age and even then he was sensitive to the Slavery Issues.

Stephen Foster was the FIRST AMERICAN MUSICIAN TO CALL A BLACK FEMALE A ""LADY"" in his music and lyrics, until then it was unknown or unheard of to call any Black Female a Lady.

NELLY WAS A LADY is that very song.

This DVD was some of the BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT ON A HISTORICAL EVENT DVD AND BEST OF ALL IT IS A TRUE STORY AND A REAL GENTLEMAN.

If you can get a copy of this DVD get it and keep it safe, again I thank God I was able to find one I could afford.",1360713600,,788,3.89375
8122223,4,B000FGG64I,"I think the ""American Experience"" covers more than top-down matters; they discuss presidents, but they also cover less famous people.  I knew nothing about Stephen Foster, but this program explains why he's significant to American history.

As an African American, my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss or ridicule anyone who made music for minstrel shows.  However, this work complicates the matter.  Mr. Foster made the first popular song to call an African-American woman a lady, rather than something diminutive or insulting.  He tried to clean up minstrel lyrics.  This work has diverse interviewees, including an African-American woman and man.  In the same way that Dr. Dre made no money off of a CD that lacked misogynist lyrics, Foster's non-minstrel music never sold wildly as his minstrel tunes did.  The work said Frederick Douglass once complimented Mr. Foster for his tunes.

The documentary interviews Dr. Eric Lott, a scholar on minstrelsy and other cross-dressing matters.  I admire his writings and was glad to see what he looks like in person.  He has marvelous hair.  This is in contrast to one interviewee who wore a tacky, obvious toupee.

Modern music fans and musicians may relate to Mr. Foster in a number of ways.  Just like many of the 1950s R'n'B musicians, he didn't make much money off his work.  Like many artists and other famous people, alcoholism played a key role in his downfall.  Like Selena, Lorraine Hansbery, or Theresa Cha, he died at a young age, perhaps before his time.

The work speaks of how Foster was influenced by Beecher Stowe's ""Uncle Tom's Cabin.""  However, he died in 1864 and I really wonder what he would have felt if he had lived to see the end of the Civil War the following year.",1183766400,14,1736,4.886986301369863
