7414748,4,B014LHPGTW,"The Mask holds the distinction of being not only Canadas first horror film, but the countrys first 3D film as well. Filmed in Toronto in 1961 on a small budget, the movie was released seven years after the first 3D craze in Hollywood had run its course. Psychiatrist Allen Barnes (Paul Stevens) inherits a bejeweled tribal mask from a suicidal patient and becomes fixated on it. Each time he touches it, a disembodied voice commands him to put the mask on now, which he does. This is also the signal for the viewer to put on 3D glasses to see the frightening visions Barnes is subjected to. Barnes continues to explore this terrifying new psychic world even as the mask reveals a latent violence in the doctors own nature that threatens those closest to him.

The 3D sequences are creepy, surrealistic nightmares brought to life. Human skulls grow eyeballs, snakes pop out of sockets, women are sacrificed and burned alive, and masked ghouls reach out threateningly. Director Julian Roffman uses the 3D sequences effectively to build suspense and illustrate the deterioration of Barnes mind. These segments have a distinctive look designed by montage expert Svalko Vorkapich to be unsettling, otherworldly, and sinister. The movie is in 3D only when Barnes puts on the mask.

The new stereoscopic edition is restored from original 35-millimeter elements and requires a 3D TV, player, and special glasses. The result is excellent and far outshines earlier analglyphic VHS 3D releases that relied on the old red and blue cardboard glasses. Bonus content includes audio commentary, a 20-minute profile of director Julian Roffman; 4 trailers and TV spots; short films by Slavko Vorkapich; and the 3D animated short One Night in Hell.",1447891200,7,1729,5.041958041958042

7414762,5,B014LHPGTW,"For starters, on a modern day LCD flat-screen with dimmed windows the 3-D in the feature actually pops. But this DVD new and it comes with a cool pair of glasses, anaglyph, the old red and blue ones for black and white. The movie is really good too.

Julian Roffman, an unsung Canadian WWII vet who attempted to build a film industry in Canada directs a ""Twilight Zone"" like tale around a centuries-old cursed mask. With interesting performances from unknowns with great expressive faces in aerodynamic Mad Men-era clothing and mannerisms. It's a little bit melodramatic by today's standards but that's okay because they're Canadian. The story is the bread to the sandwich of about thirty minutes or so of the movies very wild surreal dream sequences like in a Cocteau, Coffin Joe or Jodorwosky movie or something.

The gimmick as in a R. Corman or William Castle, picture complete with an audio suggestion for viewers to ""put the mask on now!"" to prepare them for the 3D scenes. Visually the dream sequences are great. Fog machine, shrunken heads hanging from gnarled trees and lots of fireballs come out of the screen. But what's really stand-out is the electronic music score which ranks up there with the Louis and Bebe Baron ""Forbidden Planet"" score, or anything by contemporaries like Xenakis, Messian. It's filled with weird echoey burbles, bleak screeches and eerie howls that make the papier-mch
props and scenery pop that much more.

There's a poignant documentary short abut the filmmaker Roffman's struggle for acceptance on the disc's special features as well as a goofy Halloween Roffman-produced TV special from the early 1980s color 3D. It's a good value and very entertaining.  Also ""The Mask"" is still relevant. It has a theme that could easily be hijacked to comment on the present-day technologies of recreational drugs or Oculus Rift. Maybe that's why all the way back in 1985 it was already a cult classic, used for the cover of Re/Search Publications' ""Incredibly Strange Films"".

All in all, this is a good example of the Atom Bomb bunker era of indie horror movies that I'm glad I had a chance to see with a faithful transfer and audio quality restored.",1464307200,2,2178,4.89159891598916

7414764,4,B014LHPGTW,"A present from a recently deceased patient is about to turn a psychiatrist's life into a living hell in The Mask, a film that was not only one of the first Canadian made films to be distributed in the United States, but also the first Canadian horror film ever made.

It all begins when said patient, after attempting to violently attack a woman in the woods, and an unsuccessful meeting with his psychiatrist, Dr. Allen Barnes (Paul Stevens), goes home and mails off a mask to his doctor just minutes before he commits suicide.  The good doctor receives the mask and giving into temptation, puts the mask on and enters a nightmare world that turns his life destructive.  Will history repeat itself with Allen turning out the same way that his patient did?

When I first saw The Mask back in the early 80's during the broadcast stations anaglyph 3-D movie presentation boom on TV, I was younger and didn't understand the story fully, but that was then and this is now, and I realized, when I watched the movie for the first time today in over thirty years that the story is a thinly veiled story about addiction, and about a person becoming tempted and does something that he thinks won't hurt him but actually affects him adversely, even eventually affecting those around him.  By having this revelation, watching The Mask this time round was a much fuller viewing experience and thus garners the higher rating.

This is a 2-D / Blu-ray dual format disc so if you don't have a Blu-ray 3D player, you'll still be able to watch The Mask, and the 3-D short One Night in Hell, in 2-D.  The 3-D sequences are generally good, except with my 3-D TV, I had a couple instances of bad ghosting, but that didn't really take anything away from the 3-D parts of the film.  The 3-D Film Archive should be commended for restoring this historic piece of Canadian film history.

If you don't have a 3-D TV and want to see The Mask in 3-D, get the DVD version, which presents the film in anaglyph format, and comes with a reproduction of ""the mask"" so when the soundtrack tells you to ""Put the mask on...NOW!"", you can actually ""Put the mask on...NOW!"" bot if you have a spare pair of anaglyph glasses, the film's 3-D sequences are presented in anaglyph 3-D in the special features.

All in all, a great film and a great 3-D disc and is recommended.",1463184000,,2332,4.5178147268408555
7414765,4,B014LHPGTW,"This is a review for the blu-ray version of 'The Mask 3-D' released in 1961. This movie has nothing to do with the Peter Bogdanovich directed movie 'Mask' in 1985 nor the 1994 release starring Jim Carrey.

'The Mask' is the first Canadian horror movie released in the United States. It is also the first Canadian 3-D release in the United States. It's director, Julian Roffman was largely responsible for Canadian movies making it to U.S. screens.

I'm giving the movie 4 stars for the following reasons. I'm awarding only 2 stars for the movie. I felt the movie was rather drab and not very exciting. Essentially just a story about a man putting on an ancient tribal mask and seeing horrific images. I'm awarding 5 stars for the beautiful transfer to blu-ray. The image is sharp and clean. I'm also awarding 5 stars for the excellent 3-D images.
So if you like, 2 stars for the movie, 1 for the transfer, 1 for the 3D for a total of 4 stars.

BLU-RAY DISC: The picture is superb. It's clean and crisp and a joy to watch. Not much else to say other than it is as good as anybody can expect.

3-D: While 'The Mask' is filmed in 3-D, it is only in 3-D for part of the movie. It was released in theater's with a gimick. You only put on your 3-D glasses at the same time the main character in the story does. You hear a ghostly voice telling you to put on the mask. There are 3 such points in the movie where you put the glasses on. I didn't keep track of the time but my guess is there is approximately 20 minutes total of 3-D but don't hold me to it...it's just a guess. What you see is very good. The entire time you have your glasses on you will be viewing a nightmare dreamscape with all sorts of unusual stuff going on. I kind of like the idea of only using 3-D for part of the movie.

EXTRA'S: You get a commentary track from film historian Jason Pichonsky.
There is a featurette which is a documentary on the directory, Julian Roffman. Much of the information comes from Roffman's son.
You can watch the 3-D sequences as originally intended in anaglyph (Red/Blue) but you don't get the glasses so if you want to watch you have to find your own pair.
There are several  clips of the films of Slavko Vorkapich. He is the man who came up with the idea for the 3-D images. Though he didn't finish the movie.
You also get an interesting 7 minute featurette in 3-D called 'One Night in Hell' filmed in 2014.
Finally you get four trailers and TV spots.

PLOT/SYNOPSIS: The movie opens with a disturbed patient of psychiatrist, Dr. Allan Barnes complaining about a mask. He is a trusted assistant at a museum and has permission to take certain items home with him to study. He takes home an ancient tribal mask that orders him to put it on. Shortly, it drives him to suicide...but not before he sends the mask in a package to Dr. Barnes. Dr. Barnes did not believe what his patient had been telling him until he put the mask on. He hears the words, ""Put the mask on, now!"" Once he puts the mask on (you put on your 3-d glasses) he is transported into a surreal nightmare world. It's not easy to describe this nightmare world, you'll just have to see for yourself. Meanwhile, the detective who is investigating the suicide finds wants to find out what happened to the mask. He learns of it from the museum curator. He questions both Dr. Barnes and his new girlfriend. Neither are very helpful. The Mask is slowly driving Dr. Barnes insane. From here, it's up to the Dr. Barnes' girlfriend and/or the detective to stop him from hurting himself or anybody else.

THOUGHTS: On a scale of 1 to 10, I give the movie a 4. I give the blu-ray disc and 3-D 9/10 each (only because I never give 10/10.
The acting is sub par. Especially the lead, Paul Stevens.
As I stated at the start, I felt the plot left something to be desired. There isn't much to it. What little there is to the plot has weak parts to the plot. I felt the sequence where Dr. Barnes was chasing his girlfriend, who had taken the mask, was especially weak. Instead of bringing his car to the entrance of the museum he stops well short. Then he manages to go into the museum, which is very large and find the mask which is already on a wall in an office in a matter of moments. There was nobody at the entrance to the museum, no guards anywhere and the museum was clearly still open for business. Anyway, I know that's nitpicking but I always like to give at least one example when I state there are plot holes.

Highly recommended for 3-D fans and fans looking to upgrade their copy of this movie. Also obviously recommended for fans of Canadian cinema due to the historic nature of the movie.",1463097600,,4648,4.321100917431193

My 3-D TV and BluRay player, all BRAND NEW, were unable to handle the sudden switch to 3-D and subsequently I had to reboot the disc almost each time to get it to turn to 3-D.

7414770,3,B014LHPGTW,"""The Mask""(1961) is about an ancient mask that drives people who wear it to their doom. The whole movie is not in 3D but only the hallucinatory scenes that are interspersed throughout the movie after the psychiatrist tries on the mask. This was the first Canadian horror film and the first Canadian film in 3D. The 3D scenes don't come across as very 3D though. We never get anything advancing beyond the tv screen. The movie is a B movie, though with decent acting and an eerie electronic soundtrack that seem ahead of its time. The director employed some of the best in the field for his film soundtrack and for the dream sequences. Initially the director had employed Slavko Vorkapich for the dream sequences. In the special features there are some short films by Slavko from 1928-1937, as well as a 23 minute feature about the director. There is also an audio commentary by Jason Pichonsky, and 3D sequences in anaglyph (red/blue).",1457395200,,935,4.742331288343558

7414784,5,B014LHPGTW,"This isn't a 3D movie (The Mask aka Eyes Of Hell). It is a 2D black and white film with three(3) five-minute 3D sequences. But the black and white cinematography of the entire film is great, with an eye towards emphasizing depth. And the three 3D sequences are psychologically-charged nightmares.

The extras on this blu-ray make it a great value, even ""essential."" There is an excellent 20-minute biography of Julian Roffman, the director of The Mask. There is a stunning contemporary 3D short film One Night In Hell (featuring Brian May as actor and music composer). Also included are several short films by Slavko Vorkapich (who worked on early ideas for the psychological nightmare sequences in The Mask, as did Len Lye, but Julian Roffman ended up designing and directing the final sequences himself). Slavko Vorkapich's montage sequences (created for Hollywood films from 1928-1937) and his short film (with Robert Florey) The Life And Death Of 9413, A Hollywood Extra (1928) are absolutely essential viewing.

You can also enjoy the 15 minutes of psychological nightmare 3D sequences in anaglyph (red/blue lenses not included) from the blu-ray extras. They look surprisingly good, maybe better than active-shutter 3D on the plasma panel for the crude effects (stuff poking out at you), but the subtle beautiful effects (layers of smoke/fog) and depth and detail in these sequences are greatly reduced in anaglyph.

Oh, the movie itself -- is it any good ? It's not as good as The Bubble (1966; also available from KinoLorber, and entirely in beautiful color 3D), but feels similarly like a good extended episode of The Twilight Zone, or better than any episode of The Outer Limits.",1451865600,6,1688,5.0647482014388485

7414786,5,B014LHPGTW,"To me, The Mask is more psychological thriller than horror. Similar to a Twilight Zone episode. The mask itself acts as a conduit to the inner demons plaguing the person who wears it.

I watched the film for the first time back in October at the Cinefamily theater in anaglyph 3-D. I enjoyed the show, but I felt that anaglyph wasn't a very convincing medium for presenting 3-D compared to discrete 3-D systems. After watching The Mask last night on my 3-D TV, my feelings were confirmed once again. Watching the 3-D sequences in discrete 3-D resulted in a more pleasurable viewing experience.

Filmed using the same rig used on The Diamond Wizard (1954), the first 3-D film shot in the UK, the 3-D sequences are some of the most experimental use of 3-D ever produced, then and now. Excellent popouts, with fire, snakes, and other objects flying into my face. Surrealistic set designs and optical effects were used to great effect. Quite impressive for such a low-budget film. I also enjoyed the very informative audio commentary by Jason Pichonsky. His comments on Julian Roffman, the film's director, and the early history of the Canadian film industry was fascinating to listen to. Great job by TIFF and 3-D Film archive for restoring this film back to it's original form. Highly recommended.",1449187200,15,1295,4.855203619909502
7414787,5,B014LHPGTW,"The first thing you need to know about THE MASK is that it is a parable. Like all parables, it is concise and to the point, focusing on a handful of characters and trimming away all excess narrative fat. This one moves like the wind... until it decides to crawl under your skin.

The second thing you need to know about THE MASK is that it is ambitious out of all proportion to its modest origins. It is the first Canadian horror feature, the first full-length Canadian 3-D feature, and the first Canadian feature of any kind to find distribution with a major American movie studio. Its director and creative mastermind, Julian Roffman, defied circumstance and all expectations when he assembled a creative and technical crew from as far afield as London, New York and Los Angeles, over and above his core group of Toronto film pioneers. They didn't exactly break the bank, but every dime-- and more than a few drops of sweat and blood-- is there on the screen.

The third thing you need to know about THE MASK is that, for three very special segments, integrated into the plot as dark journeys into a nightmare landscape, THE MASK becomes a showcase for some of the most phantasmagoric and compelling stereoscopic 3-D imagery ever put on film. Speaking as one who has been privileged to see a lot of vintage 3-D films, this really is one of the best-- certainly one of the eeriest. If you meet THE MASK on its terms, you won't soon shake its mood, believe me.

Full disclosure here: Bob Furmanek and Greg Kintz, the gentlemen behind the 3-D restoration of THE MASK, are great friends of mine. But even if they were complete strangers to me, I could not help but praise the work they have done breathing new life into the long-neglected ""Depth Dimension"" sequences on view in this Blu-Ray release. The folks at the Toronto International Film Festival, strangers to me, handled the restoration of the 2-D scenes, and they look superb as well. Thanks are due to Kino Lorber, the company releasing this disc, which has made a point of seeking out unusual and delightful vintage 3-D films for present-day release. This Blu-Ray edition of THE MASK is as close as any of us will come to seeing the film as it must have looked straight from the original lab, projected to the screaming delight of audiences in the early 1960s.

If you are a fan of vintage horror... if you think you've seen it all, and would welcome a look at an obscure but well-regarded genre offering... if you hunger (as I do) for 3-D thrills served up with technical care but also memorable creative energy... then do as instructed, and ""put THE MASK on now!""",1448928000,45,2624,4.612419700214133
7414788,5,B014LHPGTW,"This is a revised comment on the blu-ray edition of THE MASK which, thanks to other Amazon customers, I am able to modify with a more favorable review!

I originally had trouble appreciating THE MASK on this disc because the 2D sequences appeared double-imaged on my monitor, requiring use of 3D glasses to view those sequences properly aligned in 2D.  It was especially disappointing because, when the narrator commands put the mask on now, my mask/glasses were ALREADY ON, thus eliminating the audience participation aspect of the film.

My comments here on Amazon were questioned by some other customers, and I eventually had to revisit the 3D settings of my equipment twice before I found a control for depth adjustment.  By setting it to zero, the problem I had with THE MASK was solved.

Im a HUGE fan of vintage 3D, so really looked forward to this release with a lot of anticipation.  I initially sat down to watch it with 3D glasses at my side awaiting for those memorable on-screen commands ... unaware that my equipment settings were intent to undermine the experience.  So hopefully, if anyone else has similar issues with the disc, this experience may help solve it for you.

I am revising my product rating from two stars to five.  And will be looking forward to more vintage 3D on blu-ray in the future!",1448841600,9,1318,4.745614035087719
7414789,5,B014LHPGTW,"We ,must be thankful that we got this on 3d blu ray.  Many other 3d films are not available in this format.  The movie is a Canadian horror film from the early 60's and it is of it's era.  A era of horror that I enjoy so that's no problem! and if you like old horror films then this should go down well for you.  The 3d in this film is fantastic and  the scenes are psychedelic and  ahead of what was to come in the late sixties for sure.  The restoration is very good too with most damage and dirt removed. Which is what I want from a blu ray.  Dvd's were mostly very poorly done in that regard.  This does not contain the anaglyph red and blue glasses. At one point they were going to do that , but I didn't want this in a dvd package to fit those big glasses in.  3d collectors should want this one in their collection. It's a vintage trip into 3d film history that is entertaining and well done.  The whole film is not in 3d only the incredible 3d sequences are but that doesn't matter because that's how it was shown in the theaters.  ""comin at ya' will be out in January and gog in march , that's two more vintage 3d films. The more the merrier if you ask me.",1448668800,14,1165,3.9956709956709955

8731322,3,B014LHPGTW,"The three star rating was a result of NOT having the 3D sequences integrated into the movie, they were added as one of the 'EXTRAS' in the menu with 2D imagery in the actual film. Somewhat slow paced and not very coherent plot with uninspired acting makes for a rather dull film, however, the 3D sequences are nothing short of amazing and the imagery quite disturbing, any psychologist should have a field day with the 'psychotronic' trip taken by anyone who dares to ""Put The Mask On Now!"" The bonus featurette 'One Night In Hell' is worth the price of the disc alone.",1520208000,,569,4.533980582524272

8731326,1,B014LHPGTW,"I cannot believe this movie actually exists. The first problem I had was not the movies fault, it was a defective HDMI cable but I did not know it was defective at the time. I put the movie on in 3D and instead of it being in 3D it was showing both images, one on top of another. There was no 3D in the 2D version so I put it away and decided to deal with it later. Then the HDMI cable stopped working so I replaced it and then tried to watch it again and this time the 3D worked.

I never intentionally watch bad movies that are suppose to be so bad they are good (Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, etc) so I don't know how bad this movie really is but it is definitely the second worst movie I have watched from beginning to end. It starts being bad just because it has three strikes against it, no subtitles, very dark black and white (film noir) and a mono soundtrack.

The movie originally was a 2D movie with three five minute sections in 3D. Those three sections occur when the actor (and I use that word only because he is technically an actor) puts on the mask and they tell you Put on the mask a few times. Originally it was shot in anaglyph and was converted to modern 3D. The conversion is weird. The 2D sections are now in 3D but it is the entire frame that is projected to look like it is about a foot in front of the monitor. So this relieves you of the job of putting the glasses on and off. It sort of looks like they were trying for a fake 3D and failed.

The 2D sections suffer from bad acting, bad script and bad directing. It looks like they blew the entire budget on zombie make up and set decorations for the 3D sections. The 3D sections are suppose to be scary and I guess if you are 7 years old they would be scary but to this adult they just look stupid. The scariest part of the whole movie is the wallpaper designs in the 2D sections and Pams eyebrows that look like they were stolen from a Werewolf. I don't know if this movie was released or if it escaped.

The 3D sections suffer from the fact they did not understand the number one rule of 3D movie making. You get a decent 3D effect with something that is not 100% on the screen. Once an object touches the edge it kills the 3D effect. This happens with just about every 3D effect.

They decided to get the most boring person in the world to do the commentary track, Jason Pichonsky. He was reading a script and for some reason he thinks this movie is right up there with Citizen Kane.

One of the extras makes the whole purchase worthwhile. A seven minute 3D short by Brian May of Queen called One Night in Hell. It is a combination stop motion/live action/animated movie that is just beyond description.",1511568000,,2685,4.143953934740883

Had the old Laserdisc of this for many years but the new restoration of this in perfect 3D is awesome.

Wonderful work one and all a must have!

8731329,2,B014LHPGTW,"The 3D scenes are few and the production values are low budget. This one is only for the hardcore 3D enthusiasts.

Also, it has compatibility issues with Samsung 3D Bluray players. To get the 3D effect to work, you have to use the chapter search function to start the movie. Otherwise, it plays in good old 2D for the entirety of the movie. Unfortunately, this glitch renders the bonus 3D short useless; it does not contain chapter stops to kick start the 3D process on Samsung 3D Bluray players.",1490400000,2,496,4.573033707865169
8731330,4,B014LHPGTW,"Pretty good early 60's Canadian-made horror film.  Any one in possession of a startling looking Aztec-Mayan mask, whenever he wears it sees frightening scenarios and develops a disturbed, aggressive, even murderous personality.  The scenarios are filmed in 3-D.  I couldn't watch them with the 3-D glasses provided without getting a headache, but that was me.  Not the fault of the film-makers or the DVD producers.  The black-and-white photography is good and the 3-D scenes are very good (what I was able to view).  The Kino Lorber DVD is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1489276800,2,580,5.239130434782608
