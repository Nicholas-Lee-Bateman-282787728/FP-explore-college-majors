The Story (based on the historical events)
A group of polish soldiers manages to escape german occupied poland, after the capitulation of their army in september 1939. They are being trained in britain as commando strike force specialists.
After many month of training, they are being parachuted back to poland to build resistance and sabotage cells.
The movie does not only tell their story, but also that of their frineds associates and families.
Doing resistance work in poland is extremely dangerous. The SS and Gestapo acts mercilessly and ruthlessly to any of their attempts of defiance. This miniseries is in no way a propaganda product, but a closely authentic portrait
of a dreadful period. The german occuppiers are portrait fairly, they are not demonized nor dehumanized, but portrait as victims of their time. Off course there is now way to excuse the brutality and the atrocities, that some of them committed. The three whole seasons allow for some very interesting character developments,that don't fall into a formulas, some turns and twists are refreshingly unanticipated. The story has a nailbiting suspensefull flow. If you have planned to watch one episode per evening, you will catch yourself watching 3 or 4.
If you want to compare this miniseries to american or british productions, this miniseries scores on exceptional good acting, scriptwriting and historical authenticity. It does lack the huge budget and special effects of BAND OF BROTHERS, but does not have to hide behind the british series like FOYLES WAR, A PIECE OF CAKE, WINGS OF WAR and
ISLAND OF WAR, just to name a few. For pollish TV, the computer CGI effects are quite awesome and inventive.
There is some excellent work being done, by blending original black and white scenes in remade color scenes, with our main protagonists acting in it. I hope the seasons will continue, and go right up to the end of the war.
I'm currently watching the end of season 2, and the german wehrmacht has just started to invade the sovietunion.
I also noted that this polish production is still using Stars from the time of the cold war, together with the younger generation. It works great ! As a german canadian viewer, I noted that the polish actors portraying the germans, doing an excellent job. You can take note of austrian, bavarian, saxon and lower german accents, and follies. There are many films made about the warsaw ghetto, this movie goes into great detail to describe the tragedy. I would go so far and say, like no other. The viewer will also experience an ambiance of fear and desperation, as they will identyfying themselves with the protagonists. The germans are still winning on all fronts, the german defeat at the gates of moscow and stalingrad have not happened yet.....
Yet a believe in humanity and a final victory, keeps our protagonists not to despair.",1318032000,,2949,4.898
