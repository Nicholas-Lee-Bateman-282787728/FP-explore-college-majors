7954182,2,B00005U141,"Ah, Mexican wrestling, or lucha-libre as fans would call it, is certainly an acquired taste. I have seen my fair share of the stuff, and, while I'd never call myself a super-fan or anything, it has an enthralling history that frequently crosses into the Mexican movie industry.

Although this movie is labeled ""Samson"", bringing up images of a typically insane Italian peplum, this is really a hoary, old El Santo flick where the masked wrestler moonlights as a crime fighter/detective that has to frequently interrupt his criminal investigation in order to participate in wrestling matches!

The story revolves around the owner of a wax museum that claims to be the target of an assassination plot and requests Santo's help to uncover the villains responsible. There's some fun to be had here: there's secret laboratories, villainous monologues, and crazy monsters, yet the film falls flat because I can guarantee you'll have this thing figured out way before El Santo. Heck, the movie flat out tells you before Santo figures it out! And when a hero has to play catch with the audience AND the movie, there's a serious problem.",1410134400,,1128,4.99468085106383
7954183,4,B00005U141,Afficionados of lucha libre cinema will enjoy this rare example of El Santo dubbed into english and americanized as Samson. Since the spanish language original is equally available this version might be considered for completists only. Nonetheless the old-fashioned B+W atmosphere and awkward dubbing lend this picture a nostalgic charm. The dvd features only the film and chapter divisions.,1304553600,,391,5.6440677966101696
7954184,3,B00005U141,"Remember folks not even Babe Ruth hit a homerun every time he came to bat. Santo(Samson)in the Wax Museum was the eigth starring role for ""el enmascarado de plata""and the third that was dubbed into English. With a script that borrows elements from both House of Wax and The Island of Lost Souls you would think that this would be as much over the top fun as Santo vs.the Vampire Women or Santo vs. the Martian Invasion. But it isn't. The cheap sets just look cheap and the story drags. Santo himself just seems to be going through the motions in this one. Not that anyone was ever going to confuse him with Olivier to begin with. I guess the film's lack of charm has to be blamed on director Alfonso Blake who directed the classic "".... vs.theVampire Women"".The movie is entertaining. It's just not as much as fun as some of the other films in the Santo canon.",1245369600,,860,4.415094339622642
7954185,5,B00005U141,"The specifications listed by Amazon state that ""Samson in the Wax Museum"" is in Spanish. In fact, it's actually (dubbed) in ENGLISH. This was one of the few mexican ""Santos"" films to be dubbed for English speaking audiences, and they did a great job, too! You can sometimes forget this film is a dub-job as it's so well done. I have been enjoying buying and watching subtitled Santos films for quite some time, and it was nice to just kick back and enjoy the film without having to follow the subtitles. It's a shame they didn't dub more of these films for the American audiences, as it was a great series.

The film itself, while not the best Santo film I've seen, is pretty good nonetheless. Santo (Samson) is a professional wrestler - who never removes his silver mask or his cape - who moonlights as a crimefighter. He is called in to help solve the strange disappearances of patrons of the local ""Wax Museum"". Nobody, not even the police even think it's the slightest bit odd that Samson walks around with his mask and cape (in later films, he drops the cape, even wearing suits, but always still wears his silver mask covering his head). As usual, Santo gets to the bottom of the strange goings-on in the Wax museum.

The quality of the picture is above average. It's a black and white film taken from the Television release print. Looks like it was mastered from the 35mm film source, I saw no evidence whatsoever of it being mastered from a video tape. If you are an English speaking fan of SANTO, this DVD is a must have, well worth your 13 bucks. It's a three and a half star film, but it gets five stars for good picture, great dubbing, price and overall presentation!",1172275200,16,1679,4.483660130718954
7954186,3,B00005U141,"Another in the long line of Mexican films featuring the wrestling superhero, Santo. This one is from 1963 and, of course, dubbed into English. For some reason a need was felt to change Santo's name to Samson in the dubbing process (perhaps due to the success of the Italian strongman sword and sandal quickies being cranked out in the late '50s and early '60s).  The name change seems to hold up in most cases, but during the wrestling scenes the crowd is clearly chanting, ""Santo, Santo, Santo!"" The film is in black and white, not restored, and does not feature surround sound (contrary to Amazon's descriptors).

Many of the earlier Santo films were shown on late night American TV during the '60s and '70s. They have a campy quality that endears them to low-budget horror film fans.  There are parallels to be drawn between Santo and Batman. Santo darts around Mexico City in a small white convertible (Batmobile?), he has his own lab (Batcave?) with futuristic gadgets to aid his detective work, he has a television communication system, and, like Batman, he wears a mask and cape.

If you can put up with the wrestling matches sprinkled throughout the story line, you might find some entertainment and a few laughs along the way.  Viva Santo!",1170806400,5,1248,4.786046511627907
