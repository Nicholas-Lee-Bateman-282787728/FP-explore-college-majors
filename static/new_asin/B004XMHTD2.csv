8447166,5,B004XMHTD2,"Fans of the original Danish The Killing will be delighted to discover that The Killing's Lars Mikkelsen (Troels Hartmann) can be seen in Danish TV2's Den som drber as police chief Magnus Bisgaard. He is joined by another face from The Killing - Jakob Cedergren (Philip Dessau) who is cast as shy psychiatrist Thomas Schaeffer. Both actors perform equally as well as they did in DR's The Killing with a little less Lars and alot more Jakob in this program.
Screened from March 2011 in Denmark, this first mystery involves a serial killer is just under 90 minutes long is enjoyable and makes me want to check out the rest of the first season.
Bodies are discovered in a forest north of Copenhagen and young, ambitious Katrine Ries Jensen (played by Laura Bach) is eventually assigned the case. She wants to have Schaeffer assist her much to Bisgaard's annoyance. Eventually she gets her way and Schaeffer becomes part of the team.
Bach is just as good as the male stars of the show. Unlike The Killing, we do not get to see much of the character behind Katrine. In The Killing we had excellent exposure to the person behind the cop Sarah Lund.
Den som drber has certainly impressed me. The series is available as five separate DVDs/BluRay sets. Alternatively the full set of DVDs can be purchased form any online Swedish website (Swedish title Den som dr&auml;per) for less than $50 with English subtitles.
Enjoy the mystery.
Looking forward to more!",1318982400,5,1448,4.75
