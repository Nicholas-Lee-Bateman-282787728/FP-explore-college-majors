 We have a very old copy recorded off the TV that we watch every year. It is the very first movie we watch every Christmas. Both of our children are grown now and they still want to watch it...it is the kick-off to our Christmas season.
Why isn't it available on DVD or VHS?
Good movies like this one are few and far between...we need good old movies like this one... someone PLEASE produce a copy for the rest of us!
Stephanie Powers, don't you want some royalties or something from having this movie reproduced? Help us, your fans!",1482105600,2,572,4.447619047619048
7921435,5,B00004RTH6,"This is one of my favorite TV Holiday Christmas Movies.

The reason for there not being a DVD of this movie is Warner Brothers who made it doesn't think it deserves one.

The reason I know this is because there was another Warner Brothers TV Show called La Femme Nikita that they almost didn't put out on VHS or DVD. The fans of the show had to beg WB to put it out or we would never have gotten them.",1322697600,7,401,4.0
7921436,5,B00004RTH6,"I love this movie.  The girl who comes to marry Prince Wenceslas (before he becomes the ""good King"") is spunky and intelligent and they make a great couple.  The story is likely to be a little too good and sweet for many people, but I loved it and you hardly ever hear anything about Wenceslas, perhaps because he was good, kind and Christian; three things the secular world has very little tolerance for.  As for the comment from another reviewer about it containing ""blatant"" Christianity that might offend someone:  It seems to me that, if you're offended by Christianity, then don't watch Christmas movies; watch ""Winter Holiday"" movies instead.  We have Christmas in the first place because it is a celebration of His life and birth.  Getting offended about it would be like getting offended because someone mentioned Pilgrims in a Thanksgiving movie.",1291248000,17,856,4.951048951048951
7921437,4,B00004RTH6,"this is a wonderfule holliday movie to watch with the whole family. there is little violence but it cirtainly does not lack action. with an involving story line and quick paced diolouge, it is one of the best for the family to gather round and watch.",1227312000,2,250,4.456521739130435
7921438,5,B00004RTH6,"I saw this one when it was originally on the Family Channel.  While the video is of good BBC-style quality at best, Brandis powerfully portrays a young prince who heroically defies the scheming of his step-family to save his people and his throne.  Due warning:  This movie contains heavy and blatant Christian symbolism and may offend some viewers of other faiths.  I'd still suggest giving it a try, however, as it's really an awesome movie.  Thumbs Up!",1135814400,15,455,4.857142857142857
7921439,1,B00004RTH6,"The cast list for this movie is actually for a 1994 Family Channel version of the same title.  While I can't say anything for the animated movie, the Good King Wenceslas tv movie was extremely enjoyable.",1092787200,16,203,4.638888888888889
