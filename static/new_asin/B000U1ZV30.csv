8211913,5,B000U1ZV30,It was a great Sat. night movie.  I love all the characters and the cameo by Flava Flav.  The hooker in the pink was REALLY funny!!!,1243382400,,132,4.038461538461538
8211914,4,B000U1ZV30,"I rented this movie at Netflix and liked it so much I bought a copy.  For an independent film, I thought it was very funny and I love rapper Flava Flav!  I just wanted to see more of him. Though the plot was predictable, I enjoyed seeing hot babes and laughing- Me and my buddies watch it when football is boring. Hey- even its predictable at times.  This is a funny damn underground film. 4 stars!",1228176000,,398,4.2105263157894735
8211915,2,B000U1ZV30,"This is not creative like the ""Scary Movie"" series or ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central When Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.""  This is a little ""Starsky and Hutch"" with ""Bad Boys"" with ""Lethal Weapon,"" and maybe even some ""Rush Hour.""  ""Reno 911: Miami"" had me cracking up, but this left me non-plussed.  Clearly, Flavor Flav just said, ""Show me da money!"" and signed on for his bit part.  Predictible characters, bad acting, predictible outcomes:  trust me, you've seen this before.  Only people who were as absolutely bored as I was would bother to see this.",1190505600,,563,4.6938775510204085
