1) the images are all of the typical 'have seen that a million times already' category
2) there is too much interviewing/talking, compared to showing cool images.
3) it's a bit short

There are much better Desertstorm documentaries out there. But unfortunately, they are scarce and most use the images that have been shown over and over....",1312848000,,437,4.972602739726027
8278170,1,B0000A02VZ,"I've bought one and now regret it alot. The video quality is, by far, the worst I've ever seen on DVD, looks like it was recorded from live TV broadcast by a 30 years old VCR plugged into a 40 years old TV set, and the cassete spent 2 to 3 years on some electric magnet before being digitized to DVD.

Not much documentary footage, but alot of the host speculations are filmed, making it look like a bad case of some TV show. Don't even think of buying - if you want a Gulf war documentary look at ""Desert Triumf"" which is not perfect, but light years ahead of this title.",1160438400,4,572,4.107142857142857
