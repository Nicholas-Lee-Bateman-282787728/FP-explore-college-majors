8639346,5,B00I5E95X6,Les 4 films sont excellents mais d'aprs moi par ordre de qualit et d'intrt. COQ AU VIN est le meilleur et MOTS CROISS est le moins bon des bons. Les 2 autres tant entre les deux. Excellent quand mme et  voir!... je parle franais et donc j'ai enlev les sous-titres!...,1520985600,,267,4.34
8639347,3,B00I5E95X6,"Nothing Special, given I had to read subtitles and not follow the conversation in a fluid manner.  Character is gruff, pushy(I guess one has to be solving murders) and no clear train of thoughts left for viewer to follow the deduction.  Sorry!",1483920000,,243,4.761904761904762
8639348,5,B00I5E95X6,Enjoyed all four movies very much.  Quirky characters including the inspector who is quirky but brilliant at deduction.  Much humor but very good mysteries with surprises.  Not for the person who likes car chases and shootouts with their mysteries - it's not that kind of cop show.  Filmed in lovely settings.  Very good quality blu-ray.  Recommend this if you like British mysteries.,1443830400,,384,5.112903225806452
8639349,4,B00I5E95X6,"Seeing Claude Chabrol's name as director and co-screenwriter (with Dominique Roulet) attached to these Inspector Lavardin crime dramas was sufficient enough to tempt me.  Noted for his many psychological crime films, often regarded as the Hitchcock of  French cinema, Chabrol's films have always contained fascinating personalities and complex issues.  And this series which I was not very familiar with has plenty of intriguing characters and unusual elements to them to keep you totally absorbed.  There are two feature films and two made for French television dramas in this two-disc set.  And they are all very good and if a bit slow at times, very much in the French style, the overall effect is very satisfying. And the settings, in quaint country villages and on the coast give these films an added boost. Jean Poiret  as Lavardin  has  an often  rather unorthodox approach to solving  crimes and a personality that may not appeal to all but Poiret has created an always  interesting and unforgettable character.  Don't expect another Maigret on the job!",1412985600,2,1061,5.140350877192983

8639352,5,B00I5E95X6,"Inspector Lavardin, played by Jean Poiret, is a dapper, quick-witted man who also can be rather nasty when he comes across people trying to thwart him in his quest for justice.  There are two ""cinema"" release movies here and two so-called ""TV"" movies.  The only difference I can see is their length may be a bit shorter for the TV movies.  I have been dying to see these TV movies after seeing the other two Inspector Lavardin films, and they are just as good as the others.  All four are directed by Claude Chabrol, who I think has a wonderful way to combine humor, everyday life, and murder, in a single film.  I can't understand criticism of him and don't care.  I may have watched one of his films I didn't like so much, but the rest have all earned a place in my heart.

At first I thought this set was pricey (around $45 when I bought it), but for two blu rays with two films on each, in superb condition and therefore showing Chabrol's cinematography at their best, I was very happy with this set.  Films are in French with English subtitles (optional).  Hurry and get this set before it's gone, so you can find the exact time Lavardin wants his eggs cooked (and how many of them).  Salut!",1398470400,9,1196,4.3710407239819
8639353,3,B00I5E95X6,"Claude Chabrol's Inspecteur Lavardin returns in this uninspired police drama to solve another case.  A man is found murdered on the beach with the word `Pork' written on his naked body in red lipstick.  Lavardin is sent in to find the murderer.  This is a decent, if formulaic and predictable, crime drama with a nice little twist at the end.  Suspects abound, and Lavardin's inquiries slowly reveal hidden secrets and a complex web of intrigue around all the dead man's associates.  Lavardin is the streetwise cop who isn't above breaking a few rules when it suits him or slapping around a few suspects.  The whole 'gritty cop drama' theme has been completely beaten into the ground, and this film retreads ground that had already been well covered in the mid 80s when this film came out.  You can easily find equally good or better police drams on television any night of the week.  The fine review by C. O. DeRiemer contains a detailed plot summary which I agree with and won't repeat.  I do think his/her review is a bit overenthusiastic though.  This is definitely decent as a rental (or maybe as a $1 purchase used for a real Chabrol fan) if you like crime dramas, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone spend $22 on this film, you won't be watching it over and over.",1207440000,4,1271,4.608888888888889
