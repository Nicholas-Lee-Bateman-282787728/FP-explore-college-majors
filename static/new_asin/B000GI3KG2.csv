8132564,1,B000GI3KG2,I didn't make it past the first 20 minutes if that. Very fake and just not believable acting.,1455580800,,93,4.222222222222222
8132565,1,B000GI3KG2,Did not like it at all.,1454544000,,23,3.0
8132566,2,B000GI3KG2,"How sloooooow can this film go? We watch as four friends pretend to be mobsters for easy money.  Mind you these are four high school boys who do not look like they are in school.  Is this even believable? I didn't believe this premise. It appears that the director couldn't push the characters as far as he needed to go since they were underaged. However, these actors are so mature that they couldn't bring it down to high school level. Heres a suggestion: if you want to make a teen film get teenagers. This film has the look that it was made for a  favor to a friend.
