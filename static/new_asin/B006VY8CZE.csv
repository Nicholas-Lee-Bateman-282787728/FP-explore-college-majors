5021992,5,B006VY8CZE,"I won't go into details describing what the storyline is about, as former reviews have done so well.  I come from a place of not having read the book - possibly to my benefit.  (books always present more detail and depth than a movie can do) I was mesmerized by this movie, it's characters imprinted upon me so deeply and in a memorably moving story of vision and desire, love, friendship, risk, struggle, failure and success.  Sobran Jodeau, who reflected the creative desires and challenges of humanity, and his angel (I would want my angel to look like that! - especially those knowing, wanting, compassionate eyes) who had made the decision to experience humanity himself - as he explained at one point, there isn't only heaven or hell, but an in between place and he wanted to experience both.  I adored the angel as much as I did Sobran.

My heart swelled and ached for the human experience in this story.  I admit that at the end of the movie, I had a good cleansing cry of simultaneous joy and sadness which included the full sacrifice the angel finally made.

The cinematography was exquisite - I almost smelled and felt the plants of the vineyard, the warmth of the sun and the cold absence of it, as well as the beautiful tiny creatures of nature that lived among the vines.  Nature's richness was well captured here.

And lastly, I leave realizing that when I next drink wine, I will have a new experience and relationship with it.  ""Tell me what you taste.""  dirt..clay..metal..conception..sweat..cherries...promise..strength..

Purchasing this for my personal collection.",1334966400,18,1585,4.851301115241636
5021993,4,B006VY8CZE,"HEAVENLY VINTAGE (aka THE VINTNER'S LUCK) is a somewhat perplexing film. Based on a novel by Elizabeth Knox and adapted for the screen by Joan Scheckel and writer/director Niki Caro it comes across as a patchwork quilt - many fine story lines that don't seem to fit together into a grand whole.  Niki Caro has some fine films in her resume - The Whale Ride, North Country, Memory & Desire - so she has proven that she knows her craft.  She is supported by an astonishingly fine group of actors, a sensitive cinematographer (Denis Lenoir) and one of the best teams of costume designers  (Justin Buckingham and Harry Harrison) and music composer Antonio Pinto, yet the story never becomes airbourne - and that is a particularly important factor in this film.

The year is 1815 and Sobran Jodeau (Jrmie Renier in yet another brilliant performance) is a peasant winemaker working or a chateau owned by Comte de Vully (Patrice Valota). Sobran falls in love with another peasant, Celeste (Keisha Castle-Hughes) despite the warning's about Celeste's mad father Sobran's father (Vania Vilers) claims Sobran will be doomed.  Sobran longs to have his own vineyard and to make his own wine and one evening an angel (Gaspard Ulliel) appears to Sobran and encourages him to marry Celeste and begin his own vines and to meet the angel again in a year's time. A year later Sobran again meets his angel and reports he is not only married but that Celeste is pregnant. The angel encourages him to bravely begin his own vineyard.  Sobran's goal is interrupted crop failure and by his going off to fight in Napoleon's war. He returns to the demise of Comte de Vully and the takeover of the Chateau by the counts niece, the beautiful Aurora de Valday (Vera Farmiga). Though Sobran and Aurora represent different classes they join together to make their dream of the perfect wine come true and there is a physical attraction that is consummated  despite Sobran's commitment to his wife and children. Sobran meets his angel again and we sense the angel and Sobran are in love but a confession on the part of the angel creates a schism and form there the fortune of Sobran begins to dwindle until the resurgence of hope at the end: Sibran, Aurora, and Celestehave aged and Sobran's children are mature.  The secrets of Sobran's heavenly vintage are revealed at last. `A Heavenly Vintage is a beautiful and sensual tale about what it takes to create the perfect vintage.'

Jrmie Renier, Gaspard Ulliel and Vera Farmiga offer stunning performances but even they are unable to make the story memorable.  Given those involved form the top to the bottom of this production it is difficult to understand why it does eventually work.  But perhaps that is the fault of the novelist Elizabeth Knox.  The film is worth for the actors and the stunning costumes and dcor.  Grady Harp, April 12",1334966400,10,2858,4.784552845528455
5021994,3,B006VY8CZE,"""Allow me this one night and I will give you the world, you and the children. I promise."" A peasant (Renier) in 19th century France wants to make the perfect wine. After meeting an angel (Ulliel) in a garden and the niece of his former boss (Farmiga) they set out to do just that. He puts everything he has into his work in the hopes that his dream will come true. I have to start by saying that this is not my type of movie at all. That being said I didn't think this movie was that bad. It was very slow moving and was more like a live action romance novel but it kept me interested. I think the reason that I enjoyed this movie is that because I was expecting to fall asleep during it and I actually was interested toward the end. This is however another movie that once it's over you think...well that's over. To me it felt that way anyway. Overall, better then I expected but you must be into this type of movie. I give it a B-.",1332979200,2,933,4.076086956521739

Another reviewer had posted that it had a pagan sensibility and far from it was not earthy or pagan at all but very traditional Judeo-Christian in it's story line.

5022016,4,B006VY8CZE,"THE VINTNER'S LUCK has had a bad press since its 2009 release on account of its slow pace and apparently perfunctory characterization.  In truth the story is straightforward enough, as vintner Sobran Jodeau (Jrmie Renier) learns how to cultivate a vineyard with the help of angel (Gaspard Ulliel), while trying to bring up his family, and coping with an ineffectual patron (Keisha Castle-Hughes).  The film emphasizes quite strongly that individuals should make their own luck in order to succeed; Jodeau discovers this at the end, after his vineyard has been blighted by a bug, and the angel suddenly becomes a mortal.  The pleasures of this film lie in the beautiful photography - in Burgundy and New Zealand, both standing in for eighteenth century France - by Denis Lenoir, and the finely judged camerawork by director Niki Caro.

I do wish that they had kept some things but overall I think the movie captured the essence of the story and did justice to it.

5022022,5,B006VY8CZE,"Niki Caro's film A Heavenly Vintage is an archetypal masterpiece.  Its 19th century setting is the beautiful wine country of France.  The hero, Sobran Jodeau, is a peasant whose father owns their land and vineyard but in order to survive, Jodeau must sell his grapes to the aristocrat Comte de Vully.  The people depend upon the land to survive.  They have no way to escape from their situation.  Where would they go and what would they do?  Nature is a fickle Mother.  She gives and she takes life according to her cycles.  The old have accepted their lot.  The young, who have been infected with the freedom of the Enlightenment of revolutionary thought, can dream of change. Sobran's dream is of making his own wine, a very fine wine, one which will carry him and his family out of poverty.

Like most of us in the 21st century, who have the illusion of being liberated and work like slaves to make enough money to pay our mortgages and car loans to the Ultimate Landlords, the Banks, these ancestors of ours are essentially living our same life style. The setting could be California's Napa County as easily as Napoleonic France.  The French Revolution freed many people's minds, but the country folk remain stuck in superstition and are controlled by the Roman Catholic Church. The Comte and his niece Aurora, the Baroness, own the Chateau and employ the peasants in their wine business. The Comte exemplifies the old way, his niece the new.  As citizens of the new France they treat their workers with dignity.  But that isn't enough for our hero Sobran, who is in love with the beautiful and charming Celeste.  He has to overcome his father's prejudice; Celete's father was raving mad.  He barked like a dog.  The story becomes astonishingly magical when Sobran gets falling down drunk.

You can imagine the surprise one would have to wake up in the arms of a Celestial Being, one with huge white wings, one who found you very interesting, one whose beauty mirrored yours.  That is what our hero experiences.  A man of amazing physical beauty is holding our hero like a loving friend.  The angel is curious about his equally handsome friend and their bond requires Sobran to meet every year at the same spot.  The angel helps the hero.  He brings wisdom about the earth, how to taste it and add supplements so that grapes will grow there.  He even brings root stock from his own garden for Sobran to plant.  With the angel's help and Sobran's determination and hard work, excellent grapes and superb wine are the result.

From the perspective of analytical or archetypal psychology, the story is superb.  The angel is an aspect of the hero's unconscious abilities, the psychic abilities, or the deep magic to which every human has potential access.  He teaches, provides magical ""starts"", inspiration, creativity, motivation, hope, friendship, and love.  The human has some naive conceptions about the nature of his astral friendship.  Sobran assumes his help is coming from Heaven, but when his baby dies, this confuses him.  Why isn't his angel protecting his family?  The angel's response is even more confusing.  He comes because he wants to have relationship, to explore what it means to be human.  He isn't an angel who makes his home in Heaven.  He's a clothonic angel from the Underworld.  That's why the grape stock is so hardy.  It's from Hades' realm.  This disclosure disturbs the hero, who now feels betrayed.  His beautiful angel isn't what he seems, he now feels his friend is a demon.  ""Whether I am an angel or a demon, I am your angel, your demon."" says our otherworldly reflection.  When we want to deny our connection to our ""daimon"" as Socrates called his Inner Guide, to exorcize the Shadow aspect from our personality the result is disastrous.  Totally the wrong approach, but a popular one in both the hero's and our modern culture.  Everything gets worse, until Sobran listens to the feminine voice, in this case Aurora, the Baroness, his partner and friend.  When men listen to their inner feminine, the old magic returns to us.

Sobran acknowledges his other worldly helping spirit, by calling him ""my beloved friend"", and tells him that he wants him by his side. This is one of the paramount achievements of the Work according to Carl Jung.  If we are to become individuals we have to integrate the archetypal dimensions, the gods and goddesses, into our personality to the extent that is humanly possible.  Of course we can't assimilate all of a divine being or archetype.  We can only integrate a small aspect.  Metaphorically speaking that's the part which dwells within us.  In order to depict this process of integration the hero must amputate the Divine Parts of his Shadow and return them to the Earth, to the Underworld.  Wings don't belong in the human dimension.  They are symbols of spiritual transport attached to images of the Divine.  When the angel chooses to be with his beloved friend, at great apparent cost, the hero's personality is enriched in the process and he accomplishes his goal.  Sobran has his vineyard, his wine and his family.  His wife Celeste is the earthy expression of the Celestial Kingdom.  His daughter marries a noble-man's son thus ushering in the new kingdom of Eros.  His friend and lover Aurora, the Twilight of his life is there beside his Shadow, the male lover, the angel/daimon.  His life's work is now over and he discovers that he is getting both lighter and stronger.  He asks his angelic friend, ""is that how it is?""  His daimon (now human) lover nods in agreement.  The hero has integrated his Shadow, his Feminine (Anima), his ""higher Self"" on the path to Individuation.  The journey is complete and we have a model of how the process works, how life builds character if we choose to evolve spiritually.

Niki Caro did a profoundly moving job of portraying the hero's journey.  The film is like a dream.  It presents images which are more inner than one might suspect.  Of course we wake up from a dream with the symbols we must assimilate, if we are to understand the communication from the Divine.  Sometimes these symbols are very difficult to understand.  We have to work on them our whole lives.  The image of the angel is one such symbol.  He is both incredibly beautiful and powerful, his friendship is seductive and transports the soul into unimaginable realms of being.  There is an Otherness to angels which is intriguing.  We find his realm within ourselves, within our dreams, within our imagination.  Befriending the Beloved, giving ourselves to Love, is risky business, but once you have tasted a vintage wine like Sobran's 1815, you have tasted the soul of man.",1339113600,9,6664,4.793497363796134

8505212,4,B006VY8CZE,"Unlike most cases, I loved the movie - hated the book. My only pet peeve about the movie is that the love story between Xas and Sobran was not explored in as much detail as in the book. If it had been, this film would get a 10-star rating from me! Sobran unfortunately is not a very likeable character (in the film and worse in the book) but I still loved it. The actress who plays Celeste is not very compelling, Vera Farmiga is far more competent in her role as Baroness Aurora. Gaspard Uliel as the angel was PERFECTLY cast - again, shame that they weren't more faithful to the book in the film because there's SO much more that goes on between them over the years.... and in my opinion, that's the real story of the book. Overall, the film was so compelling that it stayed with me for weeks after I saw it. It's positively haunting!
