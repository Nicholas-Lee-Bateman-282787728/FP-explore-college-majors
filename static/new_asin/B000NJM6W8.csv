I highly recommend this book, it will not only expand your vocabulary, but appreciate how well and thought out the book is written. Pat really did his thing and it is one for your personally library.  Oh by the way, the book comes with a CD and a DVD!!!  The CD has all the hand exercises and grooves with LIVE accompaniment!!!  Check it out for yourself.  Take care and God Bless.

2769881,5,B000NJM6W8,This is a great DVD/Book/ CD package.  Pat is an amazing educator.  Each section is explained very well and includes many examples to back up what is presented.,1215388800,2,160,4.678571428571429
2769882,2,B000NJM6W8,"As a fan of Pat Petrillo, I was looking forward to this DVD. Unfortunately, it left me extremely disappointed. While chock full of useful information, it is not presented in a particularly approachable manner.
First, it is difficult to hear the lesson as Pat uses a practice pad instead of a snare drum to teach. The practice pad is extremely quiet, so it is difficult to listen for the intricacies of the rhythms. Ghost notes and accented notes sound the same on a practice pad. Turning up the volume does not remedy this.
However, not only is it difficult to hear the rhythms due to the practice pad, but it is also difficult to see them because Pat begins them at a normal, intermediate pace instead of an slowed-down beginners pace. Assuming that people purchasing this DVD don't already know the material within, it would make sense (to me, at least) to first show each lesson very, very slowly. Unfortunately, Pat begins at a normal pace and speeds up from there.
So, I am disappointed with this DVD. While chock full of useful information, it lacks in approachability.",1212969600,11,1075,4.723404255319149
2769883,5,B000NJM6W8,This guy is an incredible drummer!  Most people don't know it but he is a living legend in the drum corps world.,1208304000,,112,4.090909090909091
2769884,5,B000NJM6W8,"This is a good drum tech book for beginner to advanced drummer,this set is great,I have learnt the sticking and method from this book, and check how to play and sound on the DVD.Great job,pat. And your great method inspire me a lot.thanks. If anyone wants to begin your drummer life,take this set with you.",1207958400,2,306,4.581818181818182
2769885,5,B000NJM6W8,"Great book for the beginner to advanced student. Lots of material covered in this book and to go through it all will take some serious time and commitment.  Tab Rudiment system is awesome, grooves are killer, and the fill variations are inspiring.  Overall, this will definitely take you to the next level if you put in the time and effort required",1202860800,8,348,4.688524590163935
2769886,5,B000NJM6W8,I found this book and d.v.d  a great help.  Has imporved my grooves and drum fills Tab system was a little hard to understand but once you figure it out it's easy and you don't know why it was hard.  The play a long tracks are a great tool with this book.  I recommend this book and d.v.d.  His d.v.d's talks about clinics I would love to see him out in New Zealand for a clinic.  Reccommed this package if you are into imporving your drumming.  Great for beginners and advanced players.,1200614400,3,487,4.228260869565218
2769887,5,B000NJM6W8,"If you are contemplating buying this set, BUY IT! It is by far the most helpful instructional material that I have used. Very practical and to the point, just like the title. If you need improvement in only one of the three areas, this book is worth it. I have also realized that the more you master the stuff in this book, it opens up your creativity for your own new ideas. I can't wait for the next Pat Petrillo project to be released.",1194134400,2,438,4.226190476190476
2769888,5,B000NJM6W8,"His You Tube clips were off the chain, so I had to get this.  He's a
 monster drummer, but an even better teacher!...He gives you step by step
 lessons on the rudiments, exercises, and all the grooves have play
 alongs with a live band.  The fills are exactly what I was looking for!  It will take me a minute to work them out, but the DVD shows me whats in the book.  The BEST DVD/Book I have seen, and I have ALL the Hudson stuff.  Worth it!!",1185753600,13,444,4.022988505747127
2769889,5,B000NJM6W8,Nicely explained and i got to see some new things here. I'm sure over a period of time this is gonna improve my drumming. Worth the money spent.,1182816000,4,144,4.178571428571429
2769890,5,B000NJM6W8,Great instructional DVD for the beginning to intermediate drummer who wants to sharpen his skills and pick up some new grooves and fills.  I've played off and on for many years and knew enough to just get by...I was in a rut.  This DVD showed me a way to break old habits and re-think what I was doing.  I really like Pat's style and approach.  I would highly recommend this video.,1181347200,10,381,4.323943661971831
8178472,5,B000NJM6W8,"Yes , I collect books on drumming and am an advanced player.
I still found many good drumming ideas in this book.",1433635200,,113,4.181818181818182
8178473,2,B000NJM6W8,Pat assumes you know a lot about drums. His teaching style lacks student interest. He blows through subject lessons too fast for me. I can do better for the money elsewhere.,1429228800,,173,4.612903225806452

8178475,3,B000NJM6W8,I thought it was for hand drummers!  It has some things for hand drummers but it is primarily for drum set players.,1395705600,,115,4.2272727272727275
8178476,5,B000NJM6W8,They had it for a Great price . It was well packed. And the shipping was fast. Two thumbs up.,1358899200,2,93,3.7
8178477,5,B000NJM6W8,"I'm on it since I got it !!
I love it ! Learn to read rhythms dvd kicks ass!
It really feels that you're having a private lesson!! I almost felt like I coulp ask Pat a question ahhaah,, but no need cause it's explained in such a way that everything is clear !
2 must have in hands : Learn to read rhythms & hand groove,fills
I' glad I had the chance to meet Pat at the Drummers Collective !
No matter what level you are you'll find what you are looking for :)
In 15 years of playing I've never seen an approach to the drumset like Pat does..
Thanks Pat :)

I love Pat Petrillo is such an amazing guy & generous teacher and it show in his book..... ! Thank you Pat for your G-R-E-A-T way ! For once its fun to work HARD !!  :)",1299369600,,868,3.914772727272727
8178478,5,B000NJM6W8,"This is a great dvd.  Pat is an awesome drummer, and a great teacher as well.  This dvd have all the tools needed for the modern drummer.  Great warmup exercises and grooves, he teaches you how to hold your sticks and most of all killer fills!! This dvd is for all skill levels from the beginner to the ""advance"" drummers.  Add this to your collection!!!",1268956800,,354,4.4
8178479,5,B000NJM6W8,Pat's rudiment TAB system really works. This made learning the rudiments and practicing them so easy. It took some effort but I was able to do it in just a few weeks and I am so glad that I bought this. The play along tracks are cool they also help with reading 16th note rhythms. I am still going to spend time working on the fill section of the book. You get lots for your money with this. I also purchased Pat's P4 practice pad and dig that too.,1250467200,,448,4.044943820224719
8178480,5,B000NJM6W8,"When I saw this rated #2 in the Modern Drummer poll, I had to check it out..and I wasn't disappointed!  I rarely get DVD/Books here on Amazon, because GC is a mile from my house...  But, when I went to get ""Hands, Grooves, & Fills"", they didn't carry it!  Unreal..Thanks, Amazon!..

All I can say is, as a drummer AND a drum teacher, this is THE best instructional package I have bought from Hudson.  Pat gives an incredible amount of material here, covering all aspects of drumming, and his playing is world class.  He breaks down lots of great hand exercises (that benefited me as well as my students), gives all the rudiments in a new ""TAB"" system (you will memorize your rudiments in no time!) and puts them into cool combos.

But, the best part of the Book/DVD is the 50 or so tasty grooves Pat created.  All the play alongs are on an mp3 CD (included!) and the music is in different sub genres, like R&B, Gospel, Pop/Rock, Reggaeton, Brazilio Funk, Salsa Funk, and more...just a wide variety of challenging grooves, and Pat plays the mess out of them on the DVD...talk about feel!

Finally, Pat has some serious chops as well as groove, and he shows it off in the ""Fills"" section.  He shows some 6 stroke rolls, split 16th, and sextuplet fills VERY SLOWLY on the DVD, and gives plenty of orchestration demonstrations.  I learned some great new fill methods, and I use them quite a bit!

Just a great package...""10 pounds of bricks in a 5 pound bag""!...WE WANT MORE!!!",1232668800,5,1473,4.516981132075472
8178481,1,B000NJM6W8,"I was disapoined with this DVD. The samples are unclear as pat plays most of  the exercises on a quite practice pad, so it is difficult to hear and distinguish notes. also introduces a non statndard /confusing chart system.",1225065600,,223,4.717948717948718
