261170,4,6300208664,"Based loosely on Henry James' novella ""The Aspern Papers,"" THE LOST MOMENT is a neglected classic about love, betrayal and commitment.  Robert Cummings is an ideal adventurer, who meets and falls in love with recluse Susan Hayward; the two of them pursue an affair, but always have to content with crab-like Agnes Moorehead playing an elderly Miss Havisham-like character, with a mysterious hold over Hayward.  The production has a particularly grisly ending.

I had no idea Lost Moment was the same story, but this is wonderfully done...dark, mysterious, and unusual.  Love the sets and the noir lighting.  Hayward and Cummings practically glow with intensity in their roles.  Moorehead keeps us on tiptoe, expecting her to croak at any moment.  Very, very tense.",1289692800,3,412,4.814285714285714
261173,5,6300208664,"Based on Henry James ""The Aspern Papers"", Robert Cummings head for Italy in search of the greatest poetic love letters every written to the mysterious Julianna (Agnes Moorehead made up as a very old woman). This pseudo-mystery is filled with images of light and dark in the murky old villa where Moorehead lives with her emotionless staid niece Susan Hayward who transforms magically at night into the beautiful Julianna. Hayward is almost childlike in her unworldlyness in both roles. She is in fact a dual personality. And when she begins to loosen up with the help of Cummings, things start going all wrong. Hayward's fantasy world is shattered. And she is also the best thing in this movie. In one scene where she is standing by the window and starts to unpin her hair is a marvel to watch as she changes to the lost and loving younger Julianna. The letters are found but at a tragic price.

This is a great classic movie that belongs on DVD. It has elements of mystery, schizophrenia, it's atmospheric (something that is lost in the movies being made today) and most of all, Hayward's magnificent performance.

If you can only get the VHS, by all means purchase it. It's a keeper.",1177286400,50,1185,4.6923076923076925
261174,5,6300208664,"This is a rare imaginative film, though not at all like the original story by Henry James.  It is also a rare dramatic performance by Bob Cummings who is mostly known for his roles in romantic comedies.  Agnes Moorehead is wonderful as the ancient, mysterious Juliana and Susan Hayward gives a great performance as the mentally unstable niece whose fantasies verge on madness.

I highly recommend this one.",1104192000,33,406,4.9411764705882355
261175,3,6300208664,"Although Henry James' novella 'The Aspern Papers' - about an unscrupulous American publisher (here called Lewis Venable) who plans to elicit by any means the love letters from a famous poet to a now-wizened mistress, Juliana, living with her spinster niece, Tina - is superbly dramatic, full of neurotic suspense and atmosphere, one thing prevents it being adapted faithfully to the screen - the first-person narration.  There is no visual shorthand for James' notoriously unreliable storytelling, its gaps, evasions, its play between subjective consciousness and authorial control.
So 'The Last Moment' has to do what it can, changing or adding characters and motives, inventing incidents and crises.  Compared to James, these revisions are generally inferior, and often ridiculous, dragging a sly parable into Gothic melodrama, with its mercenary crone at the dark centre, like Miss Havisham after two centuries in the grave, more a beast or lizard or horror freak than the beautiful muse who inspired celebrated lyric verse; or the vaguely supernatural subplot in which her schizophrenic niece 'becomes' Juliana at night, playing romantic piano music dressed in virginal white, awaiting the long-dead poet-lover, while being a tight-buttoned, sadistic lesbian-coded dominatrix in black by day; or the especially sensationalist introduction of a blackmail plot, involving Venable's caddish, cash-strapped friend.
On its own terms, however, 'Moment' is surprisingly effective, James' narrational complexity emerging in a gratifyingly ambiguous play with point-of-view and characters' perceptions.  The dreamlike atmosphere of the scene where Venable discovers Tina's secret, drawn through maze-like corridors and stairways by the Ariadne's thread of distant music, is hushed and heady.  The anti-hero, prepared to drop all moral scruples for scraps of papers (Oedipal symbol of a male potency he can only play-act), is sanitised by Hollywood's needs, but his sexual pathology is brilliantly displaced onto the narrative of the 'dual woman' and her rapacious guardian.
Best of all is forgotten director Gabel's amazing visual sense.  Like James, he makes the decaying, labyrinthine Venetian mansion the real hero(ine) of the story, a House of Woman, its corridors, cramped rooms and vast spaces, serpentine stairwells and redemptive gardens, its solidity flickered with reflections of water, light or fire, as flickeringly insubstantial as Venable's male self-confidence.  It is partly a figure for his mind and his warped vision of female sexuality, both ideal and real; partly the prison in which all its characters, especially its women, are held by male desire.
The slow-burning pace is too often simply slow, but 'Moment' is an intelligent, Freudian gloss on James that succeeds where most literal versions do not.",1010534400,19,2819,5.636792452830188
261176,3,6300208664,"3 1/2 stars. This haunting drama based on The Aspern Papers by Henry James  casts a hypnotic spell on the viewer and keeps him (or her) completely  entranced throughout its 89 minute running time. An intelligent script,  fine photography and performances and astute direction are among this  film's assets. Robert Cummings, often considered a lightweight performer,  comes through here with a mature, thoughtful performance. The story of a  publisher who comes to a strange house in Venice to retrieve the long lost  love letters of a famous poet and runs into more than he bargained for is  treated with great respect for its original literary source, avoiding crass  melodrama or sensational treatment.

Having said that, here is what I say: I found The Lost Moment not quite successful as a story. I was never truly engaged. I didn't quite buy it, blah blah blah. All that aside, I enjoyed the atmosphere, the performances, and the absolutely stunning Susan Hayward. Everybody gets credit for showing up and doing what was asked, and mostly quite well. It's not their fault if what was asked didn't exactly add up to a grand success artistically or dramatically. It's absolutely worth watching, if you enjoy the approach - dusty old big house full of personal tragedy  still controling lives - or would like to see Robert Cummings actually doing a credible acting job.

In one confrontational scene, he has his hand in his pocket the whole time, including standing at the door and demanding someone to ""get out"" in a monotone.  In the next scene, now clad in a brocade robe, he pulls out all the stops, by keeping his other hand in the other pocket.  Susan Hayworth provides all the emotion and energy while declaring her love for him, after which he delivers flaccid face press with all the passion of a sponge.

It definitely had the feel of Rebecca, B&W, brooding characters, floating effortlessly through hallways in the mansion, hints and touches of lurking evil. But it is its own story.

7806428,3,6300208664,"Review of The Lost Moment
Hot Toasty Rag, October 29, 2017

Robert Cummings is a literary publisher who would love to get his hands on the lost love letters of a famous fictional poet. The recipient of the letters is still alive, but at 105 years old, shes a recluse in her Venice home. Bob travels to Venice, pretending to be a mere lodger in their home, but secretly hoping to find the letters, steal them, and then publish them. The womans young niece, Susan Hayward, is extremely strict, cold, and suspicious of Bob. Theres definitely something strange about the house, which was the last place the poet was seen alive. . .

The Lost Moment is definitely creepy, a film to be added to Halloween movie nights for those of you who don't partake in the blood-and-guts franchises. Agnes Moorehead plays the old woman, and for most of the film, all you see of her are her ancient, gnarled hands. Shes filmed in shadows or from behind, but the expression on Bobs face shows how decrepit and horrifying she must look. Theres such an element of mystery and spookiness about the house, from the moment Susan Hayward opens the door. Prepare to get goosebumps! You won't know who to trust, or what they're hiding.

I would not rate this as one of the greatest, however it is entertaining.  I have not seen many of Robert Cummings movies and found him to do a commendable performance, however  I would not go looking for anymore of his films as a leading man.  The ending actually surprised me somewhat, but I think it was because of an entirely different mind set in 2016 especially around mental health.",1467504000,,503,4.365591397849462
