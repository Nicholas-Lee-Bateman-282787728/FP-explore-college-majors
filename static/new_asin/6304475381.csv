7874171,4,6304475381,"I really enjoyed the video & aggree with CALLAHAN. But there's some questionable content that I feel worth bringing up. First off, the video shows a bat that fell onto the guano below where I bunch of insects were feeding off of it. Then it showed the insects eating the bat too!

Also, there is a pool in Lechuguilla Cave where cavers need to wade through it to get to the other side. But they're worried about getting the water dirty so two men go into the water naked! They only show the back side of one of them, but I just felt worth bringing this up.

I had the intentions of converting the VHS tape to DVD with a USB video capture devise. So when I had the video on the computer, I edited out the bad parts before putting it on the DVD.",1242086400,3,743,4.117241379310345

The pictures and colors of various caves and their formations are shot and seen in a spectacular beauty that has to be seen to be believed. The special explorations of Lechaguea Cave in New Mexico are outstanding. Te cave is not a show cave or a tourable cave for the general public. After witnessing the camera work and explorations into this unknown (less popular) cavern, I was estatic that one HUGE cavern system could have such beauty and abundance of formations. The depth in which the director/producers took into the extensiveness of filming and story telling of caves throughout the world is outstanding alone. From the beginning of caving to the research involed, and the history of caving, and to the amazing ""connection"" story of how Mammoth Cave became the world's lagest cavern system by cavers connecting (at the time) two seperate cave systems. This is by far the best of any National Geo sspecials ever produced and THIS MUST GET ON DVD!!!It must get om DVD just for the sheer beauty filmed in this documentary. This is a film that deserves the best attention to transfer to dvd if they ever do. In a High Definition quality or seen in Hi-Def would be ideal. Only then would this do the film makers justice. The video quality on VHS is fine yet it is still just seen on a VHS film element that desperatly needs to be digitally reproduced onto dvd. I am waiting patiently for National Geo to get this on DVD and do it right in all it's splendor. For now, the price on VHS is worth it just to see this outstanding (if not the very best ever) caving documentary. Imax films a few years back did a caving movie called ""Journey To Amazing Caves"" and it totally fails in comparrision to this outstanding film. Although Imax's ""Journey Through Amazing Caves"" was a horrible production (not really much to do about caves at all, very dissapointing), the picture quality put into the Imax DVD was done excellent. That is what National Geo needs to do with this 1992 documentary. Either way buy this just to see it. Especailly if your a caver or a fan of caving doucmentries where your looking for suspence excitment, and through information. This has more than you could ever want in a caving film. At an hour long it covers much ground on the subject. So good it left me wanting more. Don't miss it!!",1077235200,5,2443,4.618390804597701
