7913359,5,B00000JS8B,"This tape was excellent, but it's still no match for the first volume.  Ash gets into Celadon City and tries to get into the gym. Before then, finding a place with perfume, Misty gets all excited and runs in. Getting  kicked out by the store manager, Ash heads over to the gym and gets  rejected again because he doesn't like perfume. He finds Team Rocket and  they help Ash be their parents and dress him up as a girl. They get inside  and are taking the class when he finds Misty, Brock, and Pikachu there  also. Pikachu fries Ash to a crisp and his secret idenity is revealed.  Later saving the day and earning his Rainbow Badge he continues on. In  another episode on the tape, Brock is searching on the special road of  Pokemon fashion stores on Scissor Street searching for the special place  he's been looking for.  Finding the place they rush in and Misty notices a  pretty Vulpix and does a bad mistake. She picks it up and Vulpix fries her  head. Later learning about beauty and breeding of Pokemon and not to  mention battling with Team Rocket, the four defeat them and Brock is given  her Vulpix. This was a good tape, but as I said before, it's no match for  the first.",946339200,7,1182,4.377880184331797
