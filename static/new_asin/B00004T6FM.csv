1349181,4,B00004T6FM,The thing I love is that it is go at your own pase they show you four diffrent ways to do things with how flexible you are how tight your muscels are and how to breath good and also what you want to loose weight or get  stronger or both.,957484800,17,237,3.74
1349182,5,B00004T6FM,"My first experience with yoga was the Jane Fonda yoga workout. There were a lot of positions that were hurting my knees. In addition, I really was not getting anything out of it at all. Though yoga is not necessarily  supposed to be aerobic exercise, if you don't have to work at all you won't  get anything out of it. I recently started taking a yoga class, and when I  did this video for the first time, the pace and some of the positions were  similar to what was done in my class. This reassured me that the makers  really knew what they were doing. It provides good deal of work in both  stregnth and flexibility, but at the same time, there are four levels so  that ou will never have to push yourself too far or risk injury. This video  leaves me feeling great and I really recommend it!",949795200,246,794,4.246666666666667

Since then, I have owned several different yoga DVDS, some were boring, too difficult or not challenging enough.

1349220,3,B00004T6FM,I borrowed this disk from the Library to try it before buying and I'm so glad I did.  I can't review the entire DVD because I just couldn't get through it.  It was so boring and he music was so annoying.  I would have been more relaxed with no music than the mind numbing 90s new age instrumentals that accompany this disk.  I am not a yoga expert but I really want to learn.  However attending a class intimidates me.  If this disk is a true representation of what Yoga is all about...then maybe yoga isn't for me.,1455148800,,515,4.204081632653061

1349223,5,B00004T6FM,"This is an hour long workout that is broken down into 3 sections.  Some days I do the full program and some days I just do one section.  The beginning and ending sections are also great for warming up or cooling down when doing a more aerobic workout or as a stress relief after work.

This video is also good for those who are overweight or not as flexible because the video shows 4 different people doing 4 different levels of the same moves, from inflexible to very flexible.  So for each move you can follow the level that work best for you. I am 5'6 and 200 lb and am able to do everything on the video by following the level of modification that works for me.

This is my favorite workout video.  I first used this video 10 years ago when I was in my 20's and really enjoyed it.  Then after moving, I lost the video so I tried several others hoping to find a good, basic yoga workout.  But, each time I would think back to that first one.

Today is the fourth time we are using the CD, it got stuck and the CD could not rewind, it was so scratchy that we had to end our class early.

We also could not skip the advertising and the initial 5 minutes of sales talk so we have to wait in classes for 10 minutes until this CD runs its course.  The fast forwards and backwards functions do not work, nor is there a memory key to take you back where you ended abruptly.

I remember our VHS copy lasted 3 times a week for 4 yours with constant fast forwards and backwards to get to the beginning of the classes.  This CD barely lasted one trial with 3 times usage.  I am not sure whether it's because my laptop is for Blur Ray or not, but I am pretty sure this CD is of very poor quality.",1434931200,3,899,4.01123595505618

It offers three different modifications for different levels of flexibility so you can work your way into yoga.  The fact is, this video worked for me.  I also added an hour at seventeen mph on an exercise bike at least three times a week and I found a healthy diet.  I looked amazing after three months.

Years ago when I did yoga twice a week and was younger and more flexible, I thought this was easy. Now that I am starting yoga back up I don't know how I thought this was easy. However they have lots of modified poses which are great for beginners and those that are not as flexible. I just like to push myself and do the poses like I used to do. I was also surprised how much better I slept once I started yoga again. Yoga also helps with tight muscles which can be the reason for a lot of body pains!  It also helps with so many other things.",1419811200,,691,3.964028776978417
1349258,4,B00004T6FM,"If you are looking for a yoga escape to Lonzarote off the coast of Morocco this might interest you. The setting is a tiled roof overlooking the ocean so very relaxing to view. The exercises are done at a medium pace and there are no postures that turn you into a pretzel. Everything is done with good form and excellent instructions.

I found the whole experience very calming to the nervous system. There is a lot of stretching so that is nice. Half-moon balance is however a challenge as is one other exercise where you balance your whole body on your arms. Needless to say that is an advanced posture but fortunately Lucy is there to show you all the modifications. If you like sun salutations you will also feel very comfortable doing this routine.

So I'd say this can be enjoyed by intermediate to advanced practitioners. There are no strange postures and there is a lot of body conditioning and toning exercises.

1349259,5,B00004T6FM,"I've had a lot of yoga DVD's and this is my go-to workout.  I like it because there are four different levels of skill that you can watch.  You can watch a segment with just one level of skill or you can watch the DVD that shows all four skills levels at the same time.  This is my favorite because for poses I am a real novice while for other poses I am able to step it up a level or two.
The only thing I don't like about this DVD Is that when first staring the DVD for a new workout, sometimes it makes me sit through the GAIAM commercial and Ms Deesin's introduction.  Very annoying.  Other than that it's great.  I've sent this DVD to several friends that have expressed an interest in yoga.",1418169600,,696,4.080882352941177

I had an old VHS tape of the same Title from Suzanne Deason which I was trying to ""replace"". Although slightly different then my earlier program, this DVD was everything I was looking for in a Yoga routine.

Pros: There are several variations or modifications provided for each pose. Each of these is demonstrated by a different woman, so you can just watch and follow along with the woman doing the poses the way you need to do them. The music was soothing and appropriate. Suzanne's instructions are clear, concise, and well timed. After just a few times using the DVD, I can actually do the entire routine with my eyes closed and not even have to be watching my TV.

1349290,5,B00004T6FM,"First of all, let's get one thing clear - yoga, per se, was NOT designed for ""weight loss"" in the sense of cardiac/calorie burn.  As a 30-some year practitioner, I tried one of those ""yoga burn"" videos and nearly myself.  I still don't think they're safe and don't recommend them at all.

However, yoga IS the perfect exercise for both mind AND body, and practiced regularly, it WILL provide wonderful improvements in body tone, strength, balance and flexibility, not to mention increased calmness of mind.  It was intended to be practiced as a smooth progression of poses, to be held for periods of time, that require concentration, strength, balance and flexibility.  It was meant to strengthen both the body AND the mind and to assist connection with spiritual practices.

To me, as an experienced practitioner, this workout is absolutely perfect.  The postures are sequenced perfectly and held for a reasonable amount of time.  But the big plus over other videos I've tried is that there are other women (of various shapes and sizes) in the background performing each posture at a different level - beginner, intermediate and ultra advanced.  They also perform them with blocks, straps or other props that a beginner or intermediate person might need for safe performance of the postures.  She also CUES for the other levels so you don't have to keep looking up to see what they're doing.

I bought this when it was released years ago and wore it out - I'm buying the DVD version because the VCR tape won't play any more.  It's not too long, not too short, and I love the relaxation/meditation that it ends with.

1349322,5,B00004T6FM,"I've used this off and on for several years, and it is by far my favorite yoga dvd. Now, I've been doing it consistently 4X a week for three months. I'm building muscle, I'm breathing better, my balance is much better, my cortisol levels are down (cortisol tells your body to store fat.) I've lost a size. (nothing like pulling off those previously tight jeans while they are still zipped and snapped.)  My husband can feel I'm thinner. My chiropractor can tell my spine is more flexible (more flexible than him ;heh;), with improved posture. I hold an adjustment longer and move into one more easily. (so I don't see him as often - saving money.) I have hypothyroid - some poses stimulate the thyroid, increasing metabolism naturally. I have more energy on the days I do yoga.

I orginally purchased this for stretching along with a traditional cardiovascular program.  I liked this much better and ditched the other, and with better results.  yoga is supposed to be slow - because slower and controlled movements require muscle so you will build muscle.  moving faster relies on momentum and doesn't build muscle.  muscle will burn calories even when you're asleep.

This has been great for building muscles in balance with each other, both large and small muscles, surface and deep.  Because the dvd shows all three levels of modification as well as the full poses, you can grow with the program as you become stronger and more flexible. most poses develop muscles - even mt pose if done correctly uses abdominals, glutes and triceps.

I've a friend who is a personal trainer. she's always been thin, but when she started training she gained 10 lbs - and lost a dress size.  because muscle has 1/3 the volume of fat, you can lose fat and gain muscle, but not actually lose weight all while getting thinner. the only diet changes I've consciously made are drinking more water and eating more protein. regular yoga practice has helped me get thinner by being consistent, but it's not an overnight fix.",1365552000,2,2002,4.7601156069364166

However, I am considering buying myself a copy, because I find that I'll do this workout to cool down, stretch, and focus after an intense kettle bell or cardio workout. I like how there are 3 separate segments, and you can choose to do one or all 3. I often do the first and third after a rigorous workout. If you are looking for something that is challenging and will make you sweat, this DVD is not for you.

Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss is my favorite yoga DVD so far, even though my goal is not to lose weight.  Ms. Deason has created a good mix of challenging and toning poses with poses that focus on centering and relaxing the mind and body.  She has helped me to substantially change my approach to yoga from focussing on doing the pose as perfectly as possible to an approach where I do the pose as well as I can, while avoiding tensing my mind, face and neck.  She seems to know just when you are tensing things up to achieve the best that you can, and she reminds you to relax mind, face and neck.  I addition to demonstrating the poses herself at the most challenging level, she has three other people demonstrating modifications to each pose to help people to work at their own appropriate level.",1321142400,,986,5.341935483870968

I agree with the reviewer that stated that there is not much weight loss to this, but you do build a bit of a sweat.  It is a great conditioning routine prior to a work out or day following to relax the muscles.

While the activity level may not provide a cardiovascular workout some may want, it provides something much more powerful.  If you follow the instructor you will find that yoga conditioning gives you practice in staying conscious, alert and relaxed.  This kind of practice helps those with weight loss issues make better decisions about food and exercise throughout the day.  I have used this video for years and when I'm not doing it, I find it harder to live consiously.  One of my food issues was eating when I wasn't hungry or eating for entertainment or eating at night without any thought for the number of calories I was taking in.  I have lost over 50 pounds through yoga, diet and exercise.  Following this yoga video each day, helps me focus, and consciously make food choices wisely and realize the importance of including a lengthly walk or hike each day.

In particular, the fact that I can't skip over the Gaiam ads that come up when the disk loads.

If you can put up with fast forwarding through ads every time the disk loads the workouts and poses work very well for me, a beginner.  I really like the different yoga models that show adjustments to the poses, and frankly, I love the fact that one of the models is not super-thin.

1349356,2,B00004T6FM,"I've been practicing yoga for many years but due to life getting busy and a move, I stopped practicing for several years. I wanted a good yoga DVD to use at home to help me get back into a regular yoga practice. I knew my body was no longer ""in shape"" so I wanted something that offered a variety of levels so I could gradually work my way back to being strong and flexible. I was expecting different workouts that targeted different levels but instead, it is the same workout with modified poses.

I hadn't done yoga in over 6 years and I chose the unmodified version. It was OK for a few days and I could feel some muscle soreness but after the 4th or 5th viewing, my body was already bouncing back into shape and I no longer felt challenged.

The problem with this video is that there is only 1 workout routine and it is VERY BASIC. Good for beginners or people just getting introduced to yoga. NOT good for people who want to practice yoga fully. There are a lot of poses that she never gets into such as downward dog, plow, fish pose, cobra, boat pose, tree pose, pigeon, no sun salutations, no inversions (she could've at least done a shoulder stand), camel pose, and the list goes on.. there's so much missing!

As a result it's a dead end video. If you're looking to get fit, this is not the video for you. I got bored with the routine very quickly as there are no variations and it quickly becomes very un-challenging. The body adapts to a particular exercise routine after a while and reaches a plateau if only certain muscles are used over and over again. Eventually, it doesn't benefit from the exercises and you stop progressing. In order for you to lose weight, get toned, improve flexibility, you need to target all the different muscle groups by alternating the poses and your routine and VARY your workout each time. That way you keep your body on its toes and constantly keep it challenged. This video does not achieve that.

The setting is pretty and the music is soothing but that's not enough to save this video. Good for people who want a very low intensity and pared down super basic intro to yoga. Also good for days that you're tired and need something easy peasy.",1307059200,,2189,4.424317617866005

It has four different women (who actually look like real women) doing the workout so you can follow whoever best fits your fitness/flexibility level. You can also select the workout as a full modified, 1/2 modified or 1/4 modified if you wish.

The video moves at a nice slow pace and the poses are explained well so you never have to worry about ""keeping up"" like in some videos. It's also presented in three sections- body and breath awareness, active yoga conditioning, and a cool down. It works all parts of the body and stretches the entire body while maintaining focus on breathing. Suzzane's voice is also very soothing to guide you through the exercise.

I felt the need to add here that I belive this routine, if done regularly, helps build an inner peace while quieting the ""food chatter"" that sometimes has me reaching for sugar as a pick me up.  I don't think just performing the routine here is what is meant to promote weight loss, the key is quieting your mind so that you naturally make better food choices.  Many people who have reviewed the DVD don't seem to understand this critical point.  I thought it was important to clarify.  I can see where doing this DVD would help calm the mind and body.

I always do the fully modified and yet I feel fully stretched out and calm after this DVD.  It is a slow moving workout but not boring, I'm so focused on breathing correctly and working on my form I find myself fully involved.

The yoga itself has many options for beginner to experienced type levels. It's easy to do even if you're uncoordinated like me. It was fun and relaxing...and if you are a very tense individual who has trouble relaxing, this may just help out.

HOWEVER, the DVD stopped working about 3-8 minutes into the actual instruction. There were no scratches on the DVD before or after I opened the package. It just stopped. It skipped then froze all together.

This one fits the bill.  Several years ago I lost 30 pounds over the course of a year with weight watchers, 30 minute walks, a Pilates mat DVD and this one, which I used 3 times a week.  It's great for general toning and the kind of mild aerobic activity which I find best for tightening the body and losing weight without triggering the appetite increase that comes with intense workouts.  And she doesn't demonstrate the advanced pose before offering adjustments for different abilities--the three students each demonstrate the modifications while she does the advanced pose.  Watching the tape before doing it is the best way to work it out, and I'll pause it to look at the technique if I want to improve my poses.  And her narration is gentle and encouraging without being cloying or patronizing.

1349377,5,B00004T6FM,"Suzanne Deason does a beautiful yoga class/instruction which I look forward to doing regularly.  I have been practicing yoga for 10 years at all levels and styles and find her instruction both visual and verbal everso  beautiful and pleasing to the beginner in me as well as the advanced yogi. The class includes all levels with her students in the video and the scenery as well as her voice and direction are extremely soothing.  The beginner will feel welcome and unintimidated as well as the advanced learning from her direction for each pose.  I do not need to lose weight and feel that ALL levels of yogi experience as well as weight goals would benefit greatly from this. Her delivery/form/style /choreography and words give me something at the end of a busy work day to come home to.
I am a member of a yoga studio and have unlimited access , however find this just as pleasing/instructional and rewarding . yet in the confines of my own home.. I would Greatly recommend this for all levels of yogis who would like a great yoga class that they will not get bored enjoy it more and more each time they view/practice.

It is difficult and I only am able to do the program 3 times a week right now but I feel energized after I am done and the muscle pains and the knee pain seem to be less bothersome when I do the stretching.

1349379,5,B00004T6FM,"I have used Pilates for Weight Loss in the past and enjoyed it very much, but the copy I was using didn't belong to me.  When I decided to purchase my own DVDs for working out, I immediately looked for Suzanne Deason's DVDs.  I love the way she has several levels of modifications on her ""for Weight Loss"" DVDs and I love that they are created with round bodies in mind.  Yoga for Weight Loss is no exception.  My goal in using these DVDs isn't to lose weight, but rather to find something that works for my shape while still increasing my strength and flexibility and helping me to live with less pain in my muscles and joints.  After reviewing this DVD and doing the fully modified version, I am very happy to say that Deason continues taking round bodies and different levels of fitness into her instruction.  Instruction is clear enough for beginners and the poses flow in a way that is familiar to me, having been a practitioner of Iyengar Yoga some 15 years ago.  If you have a round body (male or female isn't really important) and you are looking for a Yoga DVD that takes that into consideration, this is definitely the DVD for you.  Pay no attention to the ""for Weight Loss"" moniker - while it may or may not be true, what it really means is that it's for people who have a non-standard body shape.",1270857600,2,1308,4.37603305785124

Suzanne is a terrible instructor. She doesn't give clear direction on how to transition from one element of a pose to another. These are her directions to go from standing Forward bend to Victorious pose: ""Sweep you arms forward and breathe, breath"". She is terrible, frustrating and a waste of money in my opinoion.

It was so good. For the basic Yoga poses this DVD is good, well balanced, Easy to do. It has 10minute warm up then 45 minutes yoga poses.
It has 5 workout levels.
1- unmodified version
2-1/4 modified
3-1/2 modified
4- 3/4 modified
5 - combined
After doing few modifies ones I did the unmodified  version an di liked it.
Thats why I ordered 3 DVDS of the same type.
What I got had only 4 levels.
It doesn't have teh Unmodified version. I was so upset, I asked Amazon about this , The sent me replacemnet DVDs at NO cost.
But those are also have the same problem.
Contacted the CS , she said I can return all the DVDs and they will refund the money. Yes they did refund the money. I ordered 3 DVDs from AMAzon market place which  also has the same problem.
I can say the GAIM- who distrubutes this DVDS  has marketed so many versions of the same DVD.They cut corners here and there. Really no body can tell what is inside the DVDs by looking at the title.
Suggestion to GAIM- Please market 1 version  with out any confusion in DVD titles.
But Amazon did very good. They tried their best to replace the DVDs .Atlast they refunded my money. The custmoer support at Amazon is excellent!
I can live with the other 4 workout levels.

1349397,4,B00004T6FM,"This DVD is a great stretching yoga program for people with tight hips and hamstrings (like myself) or for more mature adults new to yoga. Don't plan on losing weight doing this DVD alone. As with any yoga or pilates DVD you buy with weight loss claims you will need to do cardio of some kind regularly and eat sensibly. Note: if you have fairly inflexible hamstrings you will need to purchase a yoga block for support. Other equipment you'll want--mat, a blanket to fold up, and a towel or stretchy resistance band.
What I love:
The instructor spends a lot of time stretching out your hamstrings--it feels great.
There are four women showing various levels of modification so I know where I am and what I'm working toward
Its easy to follow
Its a relaxing series of poses
When I am disciplined and do the DVD several times a week I become more flexible.

What I would improve:
There are no men in the DVD so my hubby doesn't want to do it
It would be nice to work up a little sweat, but whatever

BTW, I've had this DVD for 2 years. I only stopped using it when I was pregnant. It's a nice DVD to have in your collection, but don't expect much toning or weight loss from the DVD alone.

My chiropractor suggested YOGA as a way to ""calm and relieve the stress"". Each morning, I get up and do this video. This is when everyone is still sleeping and it is peaceful. This video creates a relaxing atmosphere (music and background) and explains how to fully breath throughout each move. The more you do the video, the more you learn to concentrate on your breathing, which allows you to calm yourself. The more calm you are (stress free), the less anxious you are and the less you eat (on the go or under timely situations). For those who think they will lose weight simply with the video - you won't. YOGA is only small part of a weight loss program, but this video is an excellent video with easy to learn moves (especially for beginners).",1228176000,,918,4.536144578313253
1349403,5,B00004T6FM,"This video spent some time gathering dust on my shelf before I finally tried it. When I finally did, I loved it, and this may well become my ""go to"" yoga video for busy days.

I happen not to like ""flow"" videos so much, and it seems most yoga DVDs out there are exactly about that. I love the feeling of breathing into a pose, and the challenge of using my muscles to maintain a strong pose for a little while. Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss gives me just what I need: a good combination of standing, sitting, and lying poses; lots of twisting poses (which I've also found lacking in flow videos); a few poses which gently, but powerfully, build abdominal strength.

The video allows you to do the workout at different levels of modification, which means that you can measure yourself to someone at your level as you check your position. It's hard to know if you're doing a pose right if the only model you get a yoga master, or if the modified pose is somewhere behind the yoga master (hard to see on a small screen). Almost every breath is cued, which I also appreciate, and Deason keeps up a running commentary with advice on what you should be feeling and doing during each pose. Her voice is soft enough that you can ignore it if you wish, but I found her suggestions very useful for working on strength and balance, especially during standing poses.

And, the entire thing is only forty-five minutes long! It really fits into a busy day, and is wonderfully restorative. I'm not sure what it does for weight loss, but I can tell you that I feel physically good after doing the video, with just the right combination of energy and pleasant fatigue.",1227225600,3,1655,4.473509933774834

No.  Does it emphasize weight loss?  No.  Does it give an excellent yoga session, from beginning warm-up and breathing exercises, move on to an active yoga session, then finishes with a cool-down session including relaxation?  Yes.

Susan Fulton leads who has a British accent in voice over only w/Lucy doing slight modifications. The background music during the workout is very light, ethereal style.

Intro: 1 min
Just saying her name & elevator music.
Sun Salutations: 7 min
Susan alone. Mountain, lunges, standing fwd bends, cobra, down dog only.
Contraindications scene:
Don't do if have these conditions, watch the program first & not to do if you've recently eaten a big meal. WHY IS THIS NOT IN THE BEGINNING?
Body Conditioning & Toning: 39 min
Sitting poses - butterfly stretch, wide open or straight boat, sitting fwd bend, shoulder stretches, shoulder rolls, hands on shoulders elbow rolls (good), holding arms parallel w/hands in different positions (not bad), standing fwd bend w/bending 1 knee at a time. Standing flow poses -  sun salutations more full, standing split, very modified triangle, tree,  WOW her side angle is twisted back, she also lets her knee go WAY over her  toes, it looked like a lunge more then anything on the first side. She lost me there. Her half moon looks like a standing split, her foot is even pointed up, not flexed & pointing fwd... ok, she REALLY lost me there. I turned it off at the 33 min mark.

I love the way various levels of difficulty are presented using different people in a group.  You can sneak up a level just by changing which person you are focussing on, so you never feel you are stuck watching one level or that you are missing something.  I really love the beginning workout that is called ""body breath awareness"".  It turns out to be perfect for getting my aching back limber.  It's ironic that this breathing section does way more for my back than ""back"" exercises do, and is a lot more pleasant and peaceful to watch.  I don't know about the weight loss part, but since weight loss starts with good habits, then why not yoga.

I lent my CD to a friend and am buying another copy since they love it too.  Beware!  There is another ""yoga for weight loss"" with Suzanne Deason (same person) but it is not at all as good as this particular one.  It's only about 30 minutes total and I found it pretty worthless.  It must be a new edition or something.",1194220800,,1091,4.294117647058823
1349422,5,B00004T6FM,"I truly love this yoga program!  It's easy to follow and very complete...It has helped me to ease my back problems, my knee problems and my general attitude to exercise has changed.

I am a person who has ""0"" motivation to exercise or commit to any kind of long term exercise program. Yet, I got this video years ago and have been using it almost weekly. Recently,  I have bought the CD for my daughter as a birthday present. Not only did she become a fan of it, but also her husband started to ""get into it"" as well.

I haven't lost a considerable amount of weight but it is helping me to maintain a healthy, fun to follow routine, which is what I am really grateful for. Yoga, of course, improves your general well-being and this is an incredible advantage as well.",1194048000,,767,4.3426573426573425
1349423,2,B00004T6FM,"I really love this DVD and that's why it is so sad to find out that this edition is defective. I purchased it 3 times now. Two times at Barnes& Noble and another one just now from amazon. All three skip!

I had another edition (don't remember what year), but it is without the GAIAM logo and advertisements and that one worked perfectly fine. I gave it to my mom and now I have a feeling I'm going to request it back since I cannot find another copy of this DVD that doesn't skip.

If you are interested in details on where it skips, I'll tell you:
1) During the first pose of the cross leg position while doing twists to the sides. You do one side, then it skips and you start from the beginning.

2) During the downward facing (wide leg) dog pose. It skips to a totally different pose (previously done). It is really annoying.

There are a few others, which I don't recall at the moment.

You can still do the routine if this doesn't bother you. It does bother me because I know how it is without skipping. It is awesome!

I don't know whose fault this is, but I wouldn't advise to purchase this DVD. If you can find the one without GAIAM logo, get that one.

Thanks.

1349424,3,B00004T6FM,"This is the THIRD copy of this DVD I have purchased over the years.  Foolishly, I have replaced it thinking it was my DVD player that was causing the skips because I used it so much.  I was so annoyed to rip open my new copy and find that the SAME skips occurred in the SAME places.  Arggg.

Obviously, I love the DVD and think it very worthwhile for the beginning yoga enthusiast.  The different levels are great and I have enjoyed advancing over time.  However, it is so disruptive to have the DVD jump and pause all the time.

Last point is that you really can't expect great weight loss from this or any yoga routine.  However, it does make you more mindful and relaxed, so that promotes healthful living habits which could encourage weight loss.

Without the technical problems, I give this video a 5+",1191715200,,806,4.428571428571429

But it ennoys me that every time I put the dvd on - every single time for a year now - I have to endure several minutes of advertizing. It cannot be skipped or turned off. Very frustrating practice.

Suzanne does this in voice over. She speaks only when she has to, no spiritual/earthy words, just some guidance on how to do the poses, but for absolute beginners this may be enough for some, but not enough for those who like details & really are careful about doing it right.  This is NOT vinyasa, she does child's pose or mountain in between almost every pose & the pace feels to jagged, almost but almost as bad as a gym class stretching routine.
The active part was surprisingly hard, then again, I went as deep or deeper then Suzanne & held the poses while they were in child's or mountain pose to rest or did other stretching.

Intro -  5 min - her talking
Body & Breath Awareness - 11 min - sitting slight torso stretch to open chest, cross legged sitting fwd bend, easy sitting torso spinal twist, cat/cow on hands/knees & then straight single leg back & knee to chest, child's pose in 6 min, then mountain w/arm movements & breath, chair pose in/out many times in 2 min (I just held it the whole time), standing fwd bend
Active Yoga Conditioning - 20 min - mountain, wide angle standing fwd bend, standing fwd bend, lunges, warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle, triangle, standing bend over head to knee of front leg stretch, wide angle standing fwd bend w/arms like triangle torso twist, child's pose
Balance & Relaxation - 14 min - child's pose, locust w/upper torso up as well, bridge, knee to chest stretch, very modified boat (back still on ground), lying w/knees at 90 in air for short up/down ab strengthening, knees to side lying spinal twist stretch, 2 easy sitting spinal twists, seated fwd bend over both legs
Meditation - 2 min - her voice still guiding & credits w/same song as meditation

My only complaint is the fact that there is a little icon that pops up on the screen and if you push Enter on the remote it is suppose to take you to another scene where the instructor explains the move in more detail.

1349433,5,B00004T6FM,"""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" promotes weight loss and body reshaping through regular yoga practices. The author presents a single program for all users, no matter their flexibility, experience, or fitness level. Suzanne Deason and three fellow instructors show you a series of moves that along with the proper technique may result in a challenging workout that will give you more energy and help you stay in shape.

The author believes that in case of overweight people there is an internal imbalance between mind and body, so it uses the therapeutic applications of yoga in order to fix this imbalance.

The workout has four difficulty levels. The ""Fully Modified"" workout is for people who have hamstrings or tight hips, the ""Partially Modified"" program is for those whose flexibility improved, the ""Slightly Modified"" program is for building stamina and strength, and the ""Complete Workout"" is for people with experience in yoga. A ten minutes warm-up and a fourteen minutes cool-down are necessary for all four types of workout.

You also find in this material a mini-nutrition guide, a weight management guide, and tips for healthy eating.",1185062400,,1151,5.210810810810811

My back has never felt stronger and it is finally rewarding to look forward to doing a relaxing yet rewarding exercise EVERY night.  However, I would like to know what type of Yoga Suzanne is practicing so that I may add a few more difficult poses to my routine.  I would also love to know, since I am counting calories, approximately how many calories are burned during this 45-minute routine?  I would love to know, as well, if Suzanne has a Power Yoga DVD.

Included on the dvd is a great interview with Suzanne. She talks about her family's struggle with weight loss. Her own views on weight managment and of yoga.

This dvd is not designed to help you loose weight. It is designed for people that are overweight or even out of shape a great first step towards exercise. It is designed to help you slowly condition your body to get to the point of being able to do a regular excerise plan. Yoga is also a great way to be build a mind and body connection.

There are 3 women with Suzanne - Suzanne does the unmodified and each of the other do either 1/4, 1/2, or fully modified (or maybe it's 1/2 and 3/4 - can't remmber). I also like the fact that 2 of the women with her are not skinny models either(and no, one of them doesn't do the fully modified)! you can also watch it seeing all randomly like in the vhs. even choosing the one I wanted to follow I still had to fastforward through her talk which I don't want to hear every time!

you can also pick from 3 sections but I've done all 3 together for about 45 minutes of nice yoga. the first section  you sit and breathe and do some seated strethes. the next part you're standing and I was lightly  sweating doing some of these poses because she holds them a while. there are LOTS of standing forward bends but surprisingly no downward facing dog poses except for one and it's done wide legged and is very relaxing. the 'basics' are covered like triangle, lunge, extended right angle, fan with twist. the 3rd part is on the floor and has bridge and some ab poses and nice stretches and twists.

the music is more calm and soothing and I usually do this one before bed, esp after working night shift because it has enough standing poses to get the stress/kinks out and enough forward bends to relax me and enough stretches and twists to feel good.",1173916800,6,1461,4.301818181818182

The user is advised to read the guide and listen to all the introductions before the actual exercise portion. It recommends further reading on weight loss by respected authorities.

Contrary to the Amazon review which states, ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss isn't likely to promote weight loss any more than lots of other videos will,"" I have practiced yoga with this DVD many times and YES it *does* promote weight loss.

The music feels appropriate to the desert setting, which is really beautiful to see. (Suggestion to Gaiam: it could be further enhanced in future videos by subtley adding another sound layer of the natural sounds of that environment.) Overall, the production value has greatly progressed from DVDs from this company of previous years and is one of my favorites.

Suzanne Deason, an excellent teacher with beautiful yogic form, has a gentle, pleasant voice and guides the user on how to do each pose safely & effectively. There are women of different body shapes to guide the viewer through different levels of the exercises. This is a user-friendly DVD which for viewers of varying levels --and not only for those who want to lose weight, but also for those like me who want to maintain a healthy weight as I age. I usually practice the ""combined workout"" segment with a friend.

No.  However, if an individual truly respects its origins, embraces its values and understands its principles the progressive changes that will ensue are phenomenal.  Suzanne Deason explains these things in an informative conversation with the viewer.  This is where weiight loss, mental health and spiritual growth come into play.

This DVD is dynamic for anyone intrested interested in yoga from the beginner to the expert.  I love the fact that you can chose the level of your work out by selecting to follow any one of the particpants without being distracted by the others.

This DVD is a very very poor choice for weight loss. Many Power Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga or cardio DVDs will help one lose weight, while this DVD won't do much. The pace is very slow and relaxed and the heart rate never goes up much above a very slow walk.

What this DVD is:

Although not good for weight loss, this DVD is an EXCELLENT way for someone to begin yoga. The pace is relaxed and they don't do any of the difficult poses such as the Wheel or Headstand. The DVD has 4 different levels and shows beginners how to achieve the same benifits using modifications with yoga props. As one progresses and gains flexibility, one needs to use fewer and fewer of the props.

For me with my young kids, I think I relished the thought of having the TIME to do such slow and sensual poses, but I have learned to fit it in.

1349456,5,B00004T6FM,"I usually don't write reviews. I guess it's a bit selfish of me. But I was compelled to do so, after reading the reviews for this DVD. I felt the reviews did not do justice to the DVD. It is my favourite at the moment.

I have struggled with weight for many years. It got worse after the birth of two beautiful children. I am 36. In the recent years I have become more aware of weight loss as a result of bringing your body into balance. Strong workout routines and diets are if at all a very small part of it. It really is a combination of many things. So if you plan to use this DVD and expect to see pounds drop off, it probably won't happen. But if you have incorporated good eating habits and are tuning into this DVD completely, you may have remarkable results like I did. Initially when I did this routine I got less than 50% of what I get today. None of Suzanne's instruction sank in, in the first few times. But I kept on doing it as it overall made me feel good. Slowly I became aware of what these poses were doing and how difficult it was to do them properly.

I also am careful of what I eat, if I have overeaten I watch it for the next few days, But i still enjoy all the treats I like. I do some pranayama (breathing exercise) that I learnt in India in a recent trip and I use Suzzane DVD. The breathing exrecise help with the metabolism. Suzanne's focus on breathing is excellent. I think we underestimate the importance of correct breathing in exercise.

I have lost 21 pounds and am still losing. What is amazing is that I feel fresh after every episode of this. The days I don't do it I miss it. This DVD has helped me shape my body. The twists she has, not only provide the toxin release, but have helped me in the reducing fat on the sides of my stomach area. The standing poses done correctly are very intense for a new to intermediate yoga student.

The only thing that I may see myself doing in the future as an addition is incorporating some more specific yoga poses for a longer duration for muscle groups that I need to work on. For example I may use the cobra pose in other variations and for a longer hold to work on my arms etc. Once I became in tune with everything suzanne says on the DVD as to how to perform each pose, I couldn't believe the difference in what I got out of it versus when I had started using it.

Honestly, what I get out of each session is completely what I put in. Holding some of the standing poses for about a minute, in my opinion was harder and had more payback than 10-15 minutes of other workouts. A slight movement as mention by the instructor completely changes the intensity. But then that is just my experience.

It took me a while but I finally feel that I have found a way to take care of myself. Working out to burn fat is important, But I have finally understood the importance of stress relief and proper breathing in regards to maintaining a good weight and a healthy body. I had used 4 or 5 other DVDs, but I love suzzane's style the best so far.

This routine made me sweat once I started holding the poses correctly. A few weeks into it, I felt tremedous heat from certain parts just as she mentions. It was as if I had discovered a whole new practice.

I will continue to look at other programs for a change and variation, but for now this DVD is on top of my list.

Hope I have helped those who read this review. Namaste",1150675200,33,3394,4.153729071537291
1349457,5,B00004T6FM,"I have to admit, I had this video for months before I even used it. But once I finally did I can't believe it sat on my shelf for so long! It's so easy to follow and the voice over walks you through each movement so you don't always have to keep looking at the screen. It has 4 different women all working at different levels that you can follow along with, either by watching all of them with the combined workout (which I would recommend since you may be able to do some things but not all) or by using the angle button and focusing solely on one. This video was designed to cover everyone's abilities and it accomplished it beyond all my expectations. I can't say it will help you lose weight but it gets you in a routine and that's the best way to start. Only thing I didn't like was how long it takes to get the dvd to start the workout. There are some commercials in the beginning that you can't fast forward and then there's Ms Deason's commentary. My advice is to just pop in the dvd and use that time to get your mat out, put your hair up and move any furniture you need to.",1149206400,9,1083,4.089201877934272
1349458,5,B00004T6FM,I love this yoga workout and Suzanne is the BEST! She is easy to follow and has a very relaxing voice. I love the dvd because you get to choose an instructor based on your level of flexability. I own other yoga dvds and this one is the Best one. It shows you when to use props and how to use them so its right for you. I recommend this video for anyone thinking of started yoga or for anyone who is experienced in yoga!,1148256000,4,419,3.9411764705882355

1349460,4,B00004T6FM,"I love Susan Deason. She is in excellent shape for her age so truly inspiring.

This workout is pretty basic. It may work for weight loss over the VERY long haul. If you are looking for faster weight loss look elsewhere.

I actually love Susan Deasons other workouts more. This seems like a marketing gimic by Gaaim. Just a bunch of same old yoga poses with a hopeful name.

I do believe yoga can cause weight loss but I am not sure about this particular tape.",1141862400,7,460,4.325581395348837
1349461,5,B00004T6FM,"This is my all time favorite workout DVD.  I use to relax, to stretch and to close out the world.  I feel this DVD allows me to spoil myself. I end feeling limber, happy, free of tension and ready for bed.

I think it gives me a mind and body connection that I do not get from my other DVDs.  I had the VHS tape and I am so anxious to get the DVD!

Suzanne voice is peaceful.  The movements are fluid and I end feeling like I have had a full body massage.  I will always incorporate this in to my life.

For me (and I am fairly fit), I think it aids me to focus on my health. I don't think that I would lose much weight with this DVD alone, but I know that I wouldn't have lost twenty pounds without incorporating this relaxing workout in to my regime.

I like everything about this video!",1141603200,3,789,3.9430379746835444
1349462,3,B00004T6FM,"This would have been a much better DVD if the special features worked right. In my player, the angle button (which is supposed to take you between the four instructors) actually returns me to the main menu. It turns out that on my player, the OK button switches between the instructors -- but what it's SUPPOSED to do is take you to the ""Personal Instructor"" (more detailed pose instruction) when you see an icon on the screen. Therefore, I have not been able to access the Personal Instructor section. I see that at least one other person has had this problem. I bought it at Borders, and they probably won't let me return it.

I thought the pacing was... all right, and yoga to me is supposed to be slow. I didn't expect this to be power yoga. There are a lot of standing poses like warrior and triangle, which build strength and stamina, and these will help you lose weight indirectly by building muscle. It's also great to see bigger bodies on the screen. If you are large, it interferes with your ability to do some poses (regardless of your strength and flexibility). So these were chosen with larger bodies in mind.

However, I thought the weak point was form instruction. My only other yoga video is Seane Corn's Vinyassa Flow Yoga Session 1, which is very strong on form. I liked Seane's video much better and I wish I had bought Session 2 instead of this video. The routine is very similar, but Seane's had me sweating, and confident that my form was correct. Then again, I'm not a beginner -- just haven't been practicing in a while.

Like many others I think this is most appropriate for those who are large, unfit, and/or new to yoga.",1137369600,8,1647,4.501672240802676

1349465,1,B00004T6FM,"I'm sorry I bought the tape.  I did it once and can't really see using it again.  There is no way this is for weight loss because the dvd goes VERY SLOW so there is no way to ever get the heart going.  We could do a lot more poses if we weren't waiting a minute getting from 1 pose to the next.  In addition to being so slow that the heart rate can't increase, it's also doesn't use much strength because it is a beginner tape so you also aren't building more muscle which would burn more fat.  Overall, this one is a waste just because you have to spend more time doing the workout while getting less poses since it moves so slow.  Yawn.",1136160000,9,638,4.023809523809524
1349466,4,B00004T6FM,"This DVD is very much for beginners, but for beginners it is very good.  Each pose is modeled at four different levels, and you may play the whole routine watching only the model at your level.  The poses are explained well, and proceed slowly.

If you are not a beginner, you will find the pace very, very slow.  The ""For Weight Loss"" title does not indicate power yoga or any sort of heartrate-raising exercise.

I have found that doing yoga has helped me lose weight.  I think that having your body more ""in tune"" is helpful for self-control and by feeling good, you tend toward healthier foods.

For people beyond beginners, I like Suzanne Deason in ""Yoga for Beginners"" a lot.  Ironically, her 25 minute routine on the Beginners DVD is quite a bit quicker and more interesting.",1135900800,5,782,4.615942028985507
1349467,5,B00004T6FM,"I got this tape to support my on-going weight loss and exercise plan, and find it both relaxing and rigorous.  I do it on off-days from my aerobics and it helps to work out any soreness and promote strength and flexibility.  I've been a ""beginner"" for about a year, and this tape pushed me a little farther than I had been with yoga.  More advanced folks may be bored, though.",1133308800,6,376,4.3428571428571425
1349468,5,B00004T6FM,"This particular program by Suzanne Deason (which I've been using for several years in rotation with a large library of Yoga DVD's/VHS's) is really great! I don't use it for the purpose of  calorie burning, but rather as a gentle alternative to the more intense vinyasa (flow) yoga that I do several times a week.

 While this program probably won't make you sweat, it should certainly strengthen and tone your body as well as give you more body awareness. By having greater body awareness you'll be less likely to overstuff yourself mindlessly. You may also start to have a greater awareness of what causes you to overeat or eat junk in the first place.

 A special feature of this DVD is an interview with Suzanne Deason in which she talks about the principles of losing weight and how Yoga can help.

 For an excellent guide to losing weight, check out Yoga Teacher Baron Baptiste's book ""Journey Into Power"". It's a Yoga book which has twenty or so pages of the most sound approach to eating I've ever come across. I've been using it for years and have been at a healthy weight since implementing his approach. No fad diet stuff there, just a sound nutritional and mental approach to eating.

 Getting back to the program at hand. ""Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss"" is an excellent tool to help those who are out of shape get themselves moving again. It will help you build confidence that you are going forward rather than backwards.

 Suzanne Deason is an excellent teacher and the program is set up so that you can follow one of four teachers on the DVD at a level that is suitable for you even if you are a stone beginner. Also, two of the women on the program (who actually show the harder versions of the poses) aren't skinny stick figures but actually look like real women who have some meat on their bones (which is refreshing).

 Even for someone with my experience with yoga, I find this to be a wonderful program and I feel great every time I do it. When you are ready to get a bit more intense physically, check out Rodney Yee's excellent ""Power Yoga For Beginners, Stamina"" program as well as Baron Baptiste's ""Journey Into Power"" level one.

Another series that I always highly recommend are ""Yoga Zone's Basics"" five VHS/DVD series or their ""Ultimate collection"" which has six DVD/VHS's, each containing two-twenty minute complete programs which are quite excellent and easy to fit into most anyone's schedule.

Highly Recommended!",1132963200,9,2450,4.704918032786885
1349469,4,B00004T6FM,i really like this video because it have different people modifing each position no matter if you're a beginner or not. the only thing i don't like is that it is a little bit to slow but its execellent for a beginner.,1132704000,3,217,4.190476190476191
1349470,5,B00004T6FM,"This is an excellent exercise video with 4 options to challenge and difficulty.

While I appreciate some reviewers comments that this is too easy, I can only wonder if they understand the stamina needed to hold the poses in the correct position for the appropriate length of time.

Yoga is not meant as a mad aerobic dash, rather, as a relaxing and intelligent way to stretch and tone your body and lungs through breathing and carefully places poses.

The four options are described very well.  So much so, that my children are able to follow with me (they choose the variation they want to try).  There is a ""warm-up"" of breathing exercises, followed by active yoga conditioning and then a ""cool down"".

I have a history of serious lower back problems.  Yoga, and particularly, Suzanne Deason's videos, have given me a new lease on life (seriously).

If you are new to yoga, you may prefer to start with Suzanne Deason's ""Stress Relief Yoga for Beginners"". Then when you have a bit of experience in the poses, move on to this video.

Good luck, and namastae'...",1128729600,19,1062,4.697297297297298
1349471,5,B00004T6FM,"I am a nearing 50 year old male who usually prefers treadmills, bikes, weightlifting, bag-punching and more ""physical"" workouts. I also am a lawyer, and inevitably my workouts coupled with my long hours over a desk caused me serious back problems.  Yoga seemed a viable alternative to surgery (yikes!).

I bought all kinds of Yoga DVDs, some so difficult I couldn't make it through any of the ""intermediate"" poses without pain, and some were just so weak and unchallenging that I was bored with them, a death sentence for repeat usage. Then I got this one.

This is the very best DVD I have come accross for repeat Yoga workouts.  Its slow, gentle poses are challenging (you'll sweat), but the production, Ms. Deason's exhortions to keep your form right, the music, and the ""exercise"" v. yoga routines are really wonderful.  You look forward to doing them again and again. And as you get better, of course you'll be able to progress to more challenging programs, but this one will give you the foundation. I use it 95% of the time, and I have 12 yoga DVDs. And my back pain is gone!

p.s. It's great to see the women in the video of such different body types all looking good and doing so very well with the program.",1127779200,37,1216,4.555045871559633
1349472,4,B00004T6FM,"I started this workout as essentially a complete beginner. I had done Patricia Walden's ""Yoga for Beginners"" for a week before trying this one, and I'm really glad I did. Although this title is rated as being for all levels, there was very little instruction on basic poses, they were just called by name.

I enjoyed Suzanne Deason's presentation style - very calming. While it is great having the instructions given in voiceover rather than by the instructor while she's doing the poses herself, there were a few times when the verbal instruction was significantly out of sync with what was being done on-screen.

As a complete beginner I did find this a challenging workout. I'm quite flexible and not majorly unfit, so I wasn't sweating much - but my heart-rate and breathing were most definately elevated and maintaining poses such as Proud Warrior for the required length of time had my legs shaking. Given that I was doing the unmodified version of most of the poses however I'm not sure that it would remain challenging for very long - someone less flexible who is starting with more modified poses would definately get better value for their money!",1126828800,4,1156,4.833333333333333

I take a beginner yoga class 2x a week and this dvd is not as challenging as that.  There are modified sun salutations and downward dog poses and it just isn't as gratifying as I'd hoped it to be. However, that is not to say that it doesn't offer flexibility and stretching, central components of yoga practice. This would be good for someone who is not at all familiar with yoga moves and is possibly not in great shape. With a variety of modified workouts to follow, it does take special care to address the users comfort level. It simply is not a tool for weight loss.",1125964800,,704,4.374045801526718

Between this DVD and a chiropractor, I can walk again without pain and get up my stairs without even breathing hard, and I no longer need to be on tons of narchotics.

There are 4  ladies each doing the same poses in different modifications for varying levels of fitness and flexibility.  If you are brand new to yoga and cant touch your toes, I recommend using a yoga block to assist w/ some of the poses.

The scenery is beautiful, the instructor is mellow, and with the modifications, ANYONE can do this workout and feel great.

I fail to see how one may lose weight with this tape.  I, for one, did not.  However, my strength and flexibility did increase and I developed a deep apprecation for the healing benefits of yoga.  Yoga is like giving yourself a massage and you feel great for it.

Pros:

-Mentally, it prepares you for lossing weight (I guess).

-The strecthes felt good after doing the Crunch The Perfect Yoga Workout DVD.

Cons:

-Physically, it's no where near helping you actually loss weight.

-Too Spiritual.

-I actually prefer the gym or in a room setting because I can relate better to that than someone who gets to be out in the wild, while I'm stuck in a room.

-Too easy

-The streches that actually felt really good weren't held long enough for me.

It's really about personal preference and how physically fit you are. If you aren't very flexible and are just starting yoga, get this dvd. For a step up try Crunch The Perfect Yoga DVD instead.",1117929600,6,905,4.530864197530864

Further, the DVD formatting is really strange, where you can pick between 1/2 modified, fully modified, etc.  There are just too many choices, and this makes the DVD 4 hours and 20 minutes, but it's the same routine about 4 different ways.

I netflixed this, to see if it was something I wanted to buy, and I'm very happy about that.  If you've never done Yoga or it's just still very very new to you then this might be your disc.

When I first began practicing yoga I purchased a few other DVDs that I found very frustrating to use as a result of their being so fast paced. I felt that I needed to constantly pause or go back to keep up.

At this point I still use this DVD, along with the others that I initially had trouble with. I feel that using this DVD familiarized me with yoga so that I am now in a position to do the faster-paced programs.

In terms of weight loss, the program will provide muscle toning and stretching. You will definitely feel stronger and more balanced after doing it. The DVD does not get your heart pumping (for me at least). So to lose weight you would most likely need to combine the practice with healthy eating habits, etc.",1105574400,10,871,4.331288343558282

The positions are okay - but again they concentrate too much on giving you too many modifications rather than really explaining the stretches and breathing.  Gets boring after a few times.

I wouldn't want this program to be your initial impression of what yoga is or can be. I suggest Living Arts Total Body Workout- with individual Abs, Lower Body & Upper Body segments.  I purchased Suzanne Deason's Yoga for Weight Loss because she is an instructor on my other DVD- but this is definitely not for the young and active.

I found the yoga training calming and relaxing - the pace was perfect. I loved the tempo and also her voice. I am a Motivational Speaker and Business Etiquette Tainer and this is outstanding.

Yoga in it's pure form is about breath, focus and meditation, as well as the poses, and Susanne Deason does an excellent job integrating all these aspects. In the west, all the focus is on exercise and doing the poses, but breathing and focusing is an essential part of yoga that makes it much more effective!
And much to my surprise - there are very overweight women doing yoga and doing it well! I weigh 180 lbs and exercise regularly and do a lot of yoga and it's great to see other women the same size who do it too. You don't have to be a skinny toothpick to do yoga! I've known that for 10 years, but you wouldn't know if you look at any other yoga DVD or video.
I love the way the instructor uses voiceover to talk you through the routine while the 4 people do the poses at various levels. She explains so much more than someone who's talking and doing the routine at the same time, and explains it beautifully.
Beats me why they call it weight loss yoga. The routine is slow and soothing, and I haven't lost a pound since I started doing it - but I enjoy it anyways as a great form of relaxation, toning and meditation.
I did not give it 5 stars because of the misleading title only. Otherwise, it's a great workout and would be awesome for anyone who is overweight and intimidated by the super thin, athletic and flexible bodies in all the other yoga DVD's and videos out there. In fact, the second thinnest woman does the most modified & easiest version and two heavier women do the more challenging levels.
Overall - great for overweight yoga enthusiasts and beginners and even someone like me, who likes to do moderate yoga, but is not a beginner.",1094688000,16,1757,4.359756097560975
1349486,5,B00004T6FM,"This was the first Yoga tape I ever purchased over a year and a half ago and it is the one that I always come back to! This one is the most relaxing and I feel I get the best stretch. The length of the stretch is key for me as I have other yoga tapes that don't hold the stretch for long enough in my opinion and that's where the work is. For those that feel it is not a workout there is a difference between simply holding up your arms and doing the postures and stretching and reaching and adding your own natural resistance. Only you will know if you are doing that and you can lower and deepen into the stretches more. If you don't feel it I don't think you are doing it properly.

For others that feel the pace of the tape is too slow maybe power yoga is just more what they are looking for. The emphasis on this tape is to relax, let go of tension, and feel the stretch. The workout is in holding the stretch and building up that endurance.  Suzanne's voice is very soothing. She is heard as a backround with very light music and she gently guides you into each pose and breath. You just can't help but relax....even though you are still working hard.

As for the weight loss marketing Suzanne pretty much explains in the beginning that weight loss will come naturally when you have a better connection between mind, body and spirit which is what Yoga is all about, so in that respect it's true. I have the VHS version which shows all four modifications and I like it that way. Some postures I can do in the complete form and others I do In one of the slightly modified forms.

whether you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, all levels are shown here. This is definitely a tape you could start with...grow into...and use, as I plan to, for a very very long time.",1092268800,8,1775,4.227138643067847

Fast yoga is like slow aerobics. I like the poses and the length of time they're held. Deeson gives excellent instruction. She's very thorough, even to the point of telling you when to breathe. I don't think that detracts. Her voice is soothing. My only problem with this DVD is that I can't access Deeson's further studio instruction in the modifications. According to the help section of the DVD, it states press the enter button when you see the icon in the corner, which looks like a solid white. On my screen, it's not solid white and when I push enter, nothing happens. Maybe my DVD player is too new or there's a problem with the DVD.",1087862400,8,991,4.5418994413407825

This was my first yoga DVD so I also benefitted from help icons that pop up for you to use.
The best thing about the DVD is that it helps me to feel energized, centered and balanced.  I do break a sweat but only when doing some of the more advanced routines.  You will need to use some thing else for aerobic exercise though.

The other instructors modify the poses for those who have stiff shoulders, not so good balance or who are not very flexible. It's great for total beginners, nice scenery too.
However, after a few times it didn't challenge me. The last time I did the tape I nearly dozed off, the mellow music and slow relaxing poses made me sleepy.
But if you have never tried yoga and need a slow and easy start this may be the tape for you. The instructors are normal looking women, not intimidating super muscular twenty year olds. I found myself thinking if these women can do it, so can I.",1081468800,6,726,4.425373134328358

But alas, I'm afraid the disk itself may be an inferior product. I take excellent care of my disks. I have several other disks I've used again and again and again without the trouble that this one has given me. It started giving me trouble like the third time I used it. I have done everything I can to doctor it back to health, but to no avail.
Please, buyer beware. I highly recommend the purchase of this disk, but as soon as you get it, watch/use it several times before the 30 day return policy expires.",1075507200,8,648,4.363636363636363

You can also choose one of four 45 minute sessions, or do them all for a longer workout.  Unlike other videos, this one allows you to skip ahead and search chapters, which is great.  Now, if you're new to yoga or very inflexible, this would be the perfect yoga video for you.  However, if you're fairly advanced, or looking for a challenge, I would pass on this one.",1075420800,4,478,4.3977272727272725

If you love exercising in the evening, this workout is perfect to promote a general feeling of well-being and relaxation. Suzanne Deason has created a calming escape.

I have recently discovered that it is my yoga and pilates
workouts that are helping me lose the weight. I was walking
forever and it wasn't until I started to take my yoga
and pilates seriously, that I saw great results. When you
do yoga, your entire life changes for the better. So, you
make better choices for your entire body, exercise, spiritual
choices, food choices. It all flows together.

I like the combination and have many DVDs and videos. So, I recommend this in addition to all the other workouts you own. Variety seems essential in keeping us all motivated!

The theory behind this workout is that yoga can be used for therapeutic applications. Being overweight has a lot to do with an imbalance in your body's physiology and an internal disconnection between the mind and body.

If you think about when you overeat it might be when you are feeling stressed. It is much easier to keep to your healthy nutrition plan when you feel calm and in control. I also have come to believe that when we are stressed, our bodies pack on the pounds.

So, this workout gives a calmness to your being and in this way you help to control the bodies healing process.

There is a 10 minute ""Body and Breath"" warm-up section to loosen the muscles and heat the core. The breathing cues are excellent and you will find yourself enjoying the deep cleansing breaths.

This is followed by ""Active Yoga Conditioning."" A mirror behind you is helpful at first until you learn to moves. Or you can just do some backwards and still see the screen. Many of the poses where chosen with larger bodies in mind. This is great for people who are just starting yoga. You will notice that three of the instructors are definitely more like the ""normal size"" woman.

It was comforting to me to see women who modified various poses as I often have to modify them. Instead of feeling like I could not do the poses, I felt I was reaching a level that was comfortable for me. You may also find you can do some of the poses from the advanced level and some from the modified. You feel so proud of yourself when you can finally feel comfortable doing most of the advanced poses.

Finally you enter the 14 minute cool down phase called: ""Balance and Relaxation.""

I find that my yoga and Pilates workout ""moments"" have become so healing and nurturing. If you wish to make your setting even more comfortable and are familiar with yoga, I would recommend a nice duvet/comforter covered in a soft fabric. Once folded in half, this gives you a nice soft padded space on which you can place your yoga mat, etc. If you need props, there is information in the pamphlet that is included with the DVD.

Think of exercise as your own private mini-vacation and suddenly exercise is something you start to look forward to. You could also walk for 30 minutes before starting these exercises or walk in the morning and do this video at night.

""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" is an exercise program for the entire mind/body/spirit connection that will develop concentration, patience, body awareness, muscle tone and a sense of emotional calm.

If you are new to Yoga, this might be one of the best places to start. Also look for ""OM Yoga"" in a box.

Suzanne Deason has four modifications in this tape, so that if you are having a not-so-flexible day, you can still participate in the workout.

I love the way she focuses on breathing and awareness and gives very good instruction throughout the video.  It seems that a lot of the reviewers think this DVD moves too slowly, but I love that it does move in a relaxed way so that I have more time to think about what I'm doing and become more aware of body alignment and breathing. To me, this is what yoga is about. In only a month, I can already see a difference in my body - everything seems to be flowing better, my legs seem longer, and I feel more elegant and poised.  Susanne Deason is in stark contrast to say, Denise Austin, who moves frenetically through each posture with little or no instruction.",1074816000,,902,4.454545454545454
1349495,4,B00004T6FM,This is a good yoga workout but I don't like it as much as the class I am taking.  I don't feel refreshed after doing it as I do in class.  She instructs very well and there are 4 different levels demonstrated separately or altogether.  It is enjoyable.  Maybe it is just the difference between live and on TV.,1064880000,3,310,4.203389830508475
1349496,4,B00004T6FM,"I bought this video a long time ago, did it once and just didn't ""feel it"". I recently tried it again and this time, I could. It is definitely for beginners, which is great because I wasn't too flexible to start. Deason is soothing, not annoying, and I find the poses challenging if I apply myself and pay attention to Deason's directions. If you have done yoga before, you will be bored and probably hate this video. But if you are just starting out, this video is perfect. It targets the major muscle groups and focuses on smooth, regulated breathing. The reviewer who complained about Deason telling students to inhale then forgetting to say ""exhale"" before she started talking should have thought about maybe breathing for themselves. Deason does not always tell you when to inhale and exhale but she did say at the beginning to concentrate on ""smooth regulated breathing"" and if you pay attention to the flow of breathing as she directs you the first few times, you can keep it up on your own. I did it on my own and found I was pretty much in sync with her. I did start to feel my core warming up a bit in the middle of the workout, but what I love the best is the relaxation at the end. I felt so good... and I feel like I did something. If you're a beginner, try this video as a slow start and alternate with another beginning tape. Winsor Pilates' 20 Minute Workout is challenging and an excellent ""girly"" workout.",1063756800,2,1423,4.435114503816794

There are four workout levels:

Complete Workout - For anyone who has experience in yoga. All you need is a yoga mat.
Slightly Modified (1/4) - To build strength and stamina.
Partially Modified (1/2) - When your flexibility improves.
Fully Modified - If you have tight hips or hamstrings, you can use a strap, bricks
and a blanket.

All the workouts contain a 10 minute ""Body and Breath"" warm-up section to loosen the muscles and heat the core. The breathing cues are excellent and you will find yourself enjoying the deep cleansing breaths.

During the workout you might notice a Personal Instructor Icon. On my DVD control I had to select the ""ok"" to get this feature to work. There is also a nice way to get to various workout levels. You just press the ""angle"" button.

Once you watch the complete workout/combination workout, you can then figure out which level you are at. After watching the combined workout, you will more than likely enjoy just working out with one instructor. You have the choice of four instructors.

1349498,3,B00004T6FM,"I've done this DVD workout a few times, and all in all it's not a bad routine. I usually skip through much of the first part where she gives breathing instruction because it is just painfully slow. The conditioning part of the workout is actually not bad, and as many others have mentioned the ability to see the workout modified for your level is a fantastic addition. Overall though, I enjoy Alan Finger's Yoga Zone workouts much more than Suzanne Deason.  I feel he gives much better instruction, and provides superior guidance on each section of his programs. I also do not care for the new age style comments she uses throughout the routine. I love Yoga for the physical and relaxation aspects, but don't care for the ""whole being"" comments so much. I do also like that the other participants in the video are real women with normal bodies, and not totally buff supermodels as you often see in exercise videos.",1052352000,32,915,4.648148148148148
1349499,5,B00004T6FM,"This is my favorite yoga dvd/video (I own 12) because the viewer has the ability to select the level of workout (from inflexible beginner, to more flexible beginner, to more experienced flexible beginner, to advanced beginner), and because the routine is about an hour long.  On days when you can't get to yoga class, class can come to you.  As you improve, you can change the level of workout accordingly.
For those of you who are trying to lead a healthier life, including stress and weight reduction, I think this tape will help.  Deason emphasizes making conscious choices in the moment rather than any ""magic quick fix"" approach.  She also points out that no tape will do all the work for you--you have to make long-term lifestyle changes.
Do not buy this video if you are into Bikram, flow or aerobically-inclined yoga--it's in the Iyengar tradition of careful body placements and sustained poses. Still, you will probably work up a sweat since Deason selects poses that rely upon large muscle groups to get your heart rate up without jumping around or turning the heat up to 102 degrees.",1051228800,19,1094,4.803191489361702

I like that you can choose a view to follow the person more at your level.  It doesn't make me feel like a fool, yet gives me something to aspire to.  It is kind of long (one reason I don't use it much) but I think yoga is supposed to be.  I haven't lost any weight using it, but I never expected to.",1049673600,2,435,3.6847826086956523

If you are a beginner please don't buy this - it will surely turn you off Yoga as it is slow, boring and tedious.  Luckily I was feeling a little flush when I ordered this and I ordered another Yoga DVD at the same time which is wonderful - I love it.  It is The Perfect Yoga Workout from the Crunch studios.

Deason is a gentle, calming teacher, the workout is well paced and 45 min. long, in a beautiful outdoor setting w/ great music; 3 additional women practice simultaneously in different modifications of each pose. Great for basics and when combined in a regular routine w/ Pilates, after 15 sessions you'll be ready for a more strenuous level of exercise. Relaxing while envigorating, perfect for the morning or when stressed after a busy day.",1043798400,4,599,4.882352941176471
1349505,5,B00004T6FM,"I use this video for my ""off days"" of more intense exercise, or when I have had a stressful day and want to calm down.  This particular video is great in that it both soothes you and energizes you at the same time!  Although I am fairly flexible to begin with, I find that this video helps me to improve on that, and I am impressed by Suzanne Deason's attention to all levels of yoga practicioners by providing 3 other modifications to her routine so everyone can follow along (provided they have the yoga props, which you can easily purchase).  For people who fear that yoga involves far more contortion than they can muster, you will be relieved to find that none of the poses in the routine are at all complicated, and Suzanne throws in reminders/suggestions every step of the way to make sure you're doing them correctly.
Clearly, you won't see a dramatic loss of weight after your first couple times using this tape.  However, you will get a renewed sense of satisfaction in taking time for yourself, and I believe that weight loss and fitness in general is not just about huffing and puffing, but also involves your emotional state.  ""Look good, feel good"" should be reversed to ""Feel good, look good""!
What this tape WILL do for you, and you will feel it right away, is begin to tone your major muscle groups simply by holding the positions.  My legs always feel noodly, like I just did an intense workout, after doing this routine!  It's kind of bizarre to feel yourself almost breaking a sweat and not moving at all.  This tape is also wonderful, for intense exercisers, to be used the day after a hard workout, to stretch and relax your body and prepare for the next workout. :)",1042502400,8,1688,4.529605263157895

The setting and music are very soothing...BUT....it SKIPS all over the place. I know that it isn't my player because its new.

There are three other ladies who provide modifications for all fitness levels.  The background music and location (the desert) are very relaxing.

1349508,4,B00004T6FM,"The real secret to Suzanne Deason's DVD ""For Weight Loss"" series is found in her Pilates Video. She explains ""The exercises were chosen with the idea that larger bodies would be performing them."" While she has a timeless dancers figure, a look at 2 of the 4 models demonstrates that these moves can be done those who are somewhat overweight. (Deluxe Edition) So don't expect to see any airplanes, plows, or down doggies. It's great to see that all models are not in their pert 20's.
The setting is Sedona Arizona which provides a stunning backdrop from every angle.  Speaking of Angles, the DVD edition allows not only to pick the level you want to do, but during the exercises it can be changed by using the angle button on the DVD player. This uses the DVD Multilayering technique to isolate the desired level of performance.  This especially useful for level 3, which is not quite as obvious at times. It's easy to switch levels as needed. The music is clearly in the spirit of Sedona and well suited to the video. The transitions are well done and the moves are explained.
A Personal Assistant Icon can be set up and when it appears you can click on it and it takes you to a studio where more detailed explainations are given.  The only disadvantage is I haven't been able to have it return to the same spot in the work out.  I would also like to have a special studio section where the detailed explainations can be viewed all at once.
Some complain that the moves are not held long enough. It is appropriate however given the style of the exercise for the less fit. It's great for beginners, larger bodies, or those who want a relaxing workout. If longer time is needed, press the pause button.
Suzanne is clearly a skilled and experienced instructor.  The entire workout is recommended since it glides easily from breathing to warm up to strength to cool down.  Her voice is soothing, and relaxing.  Don't be surprized if your eyes are closed at the end of the exercise, and you feel both relaxed and balanced.

The DVD has 4 different women and you follow the one that matches your ability level. I like this because I feel I won't outgrow the DVD too quickly. I don't like the title of the DVD. I like doing yoga for flexibility. This DVD is not for weight loss. If you buy it for that sole purpose you will be disappointed. This is just once piece of a healthly lifestyle.

Later I began doing  alot of Denise Austin video's, including her Yoga workouts.  They were great and as I progressed I thought maybe I was ready to try Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. I felt it would be more challenging since the Yoga instructor seemed to ""specialize"" in Yoga and Denise Austin does several different types of work outs.  Boy was I mistaken.  This video does not offer a very big variety of poses, and the poses it does have are not that challenging.  There is mostly stretching and breathing.

The video has four different levels of instruction, so you can start out slowly and then make the exercises progressively more difficult as the weeks go by.  It's definitely not aerobic exercise, but the more vigorous parts of the workout certainly make you sweat.

But if you're just starting out, or are overweight (as I was at the time), or even if you're just scared to do more challenging yoga, it's not a bad start.  I can't really say that it helps you lose weight though.

There are 3 examples of modifications so you can work up to the full poses, and the music enhances the experience. I was very comfortable the whole time in knowing that I was doing it right. Some instructors leave me wondering, but she did not. Her cues for breathing were ever-present, yet not overbearing or annoying. The video is visually pleasing and is a pleasure to do.
I bought several tapes when I first started yoga, and this is my favorite. After I watched Yoga for Dummies, I was ready to try this one.  I have only done it about 5 times and I am already improving. It's a great yoga video for beginners, and probably for more advanced viewers as well.",1035504000,,822,4.547297297297297

Right from the start, the imagery and sounds are relaxing and beautiful (what a wonderful setting!) and help to place your mind in just the right zone. The workout itself was easy to follow and challenging enough for someone used to working out but new to yoga. Both during and after the workout - if that is the right term? - I felt relaxed and rejuventated and had no trouble following Suzanne Deason's intruction even when I wasn't able to look at the TV. Even though I was able to do the 1/4 modified workout first time, I can see myself continuing to use this DVD for a long time to come because of the effect I feel on my mind and my body. I'll definitely be integrating this one into my usual workout schedule.
The DVD itself should get 10 stars. There are 4 different versions of the workout and the chaptering is placed at sensible intervals. The four versions are aimed at different fitness and flexibility levels and have different soundtracks customised for the version you are doing. I wish all fitness DVDs were like this!
Suzanne is clear about what this DVD is really about; it's more about getting you onto the road to a healthier lifestyle not about shedding pounds - shame on those marketing people!

There are three other people besides Suzanne on the tape; each one does a modified version of a pose.  And it was wonderful to see normal-sized people on a fitness video!!!  It's very encouraging not to be faced with four stick figures.  Suzanne is a great instructor.  She guides you, but is not intrusive or annoying.  The music is great; it is calming and serene, not at all overpowering or bothersome.  The beautiful backdrop is also a plus--it's nice not to be in another boring studio.  I did need to use the props (the blocks and strap, which I had purchased already), but if you don't have these things, you can use household substitutes like a small box and belt...or nothing at all if you're flexible enough!  I highly recommend this tape to anyone interested in a yoga program that stretches everything and leaves you feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.",1030579200,7,1146,4.651741293532338
1349518,4,B00004T6FM,"I am in average shape, but was not at all familiar with yoga.  This was an excellent DVD to begin with because each pose is clearly explained, and the Personal Instructor feature allows you to break from the program to get specific instruction, and then return to where you left off.
In addition to the poses being clearly explained, the instructor continually reminds you to breathe and focus.  The setting (in an Arizona desert) is stunning, and the music is calming and fits the workout well.  Specifically, at the end of the workout when you are instructed to stay in Relaxation/Corpse Pose for as long as you like to relax, the instruction ends but the program continues with music so you don't feel any discountinuation.
The only negative comment I have for this DVD is that it is too short.  If you do all three sections back-to-back, it only amounts to about 40 minutes of activity.  Most advanced students of yoga I know practice for 1-2 hours at a time.  I always feel at the end like I could have continued for much longer.  I have not been able to find a DVD that lasts more than 45 minutes anywhere, though.
Because the program is short, I have not experienced noticeable weight loss after about 8 weeks, but I have noticed a significant increase in flexibility, strength, and serenity.",1030147200,23,1299,4.646288209606987

Setting aside this time for my physical and mental state has been a great gift to give to myself. It was just what I was looking for! Thanks!",1029801600,,372,3.8947368421052633
1349520,5,B00004T6FM,"When I first began practicing yoga at home with videos, this video quickly became one of my favorites. It provides a gentle yoga workout for your entire body with a particular focus on your breathing. The older yet very fit instructor, Suzanne Deason, emphasizes the importance of a mind-body connection without getting into new-age or Eastern philosophy. Suzanne's voice is very calm, and her body both strong and limber. She is accompanied by three yoga students, two of whom are larger-sized. Each of the three students shows a different level of modifications, from slightly to completely modified.  I particularly liked how the two larger models displayed the more flexible versions of the poses, showing that yoga postures can be performed by anyone, regardless of body type.

The practice begins with some basic breathing instruction in both seated and standing positions.  Suzanne then leads your through a nice variety of standing poses, including a warrior series, lunges, triangle, and wide legged forward bend.  The practice concludes on the floor with abdominal work, twists, bridge, and relaxation pose to finish, for a total of 47 minutes.  If you are doing modified versions of the poses, props are recommended:  as a beginner, I was able to get by with a single yoga block (a sturdy book could be subsituted), and now that I have been practicing yoga for several years, I no longer need the props when using this video.

I still enjoy this tape now that I've been doing it for awhile; it's both relaxing and energizing.  More advanced yoga students may find the routine to be too slow and the moves to be too easy, but that's exactly what I like about it, as it's a nice change from my more challenging yoga videos.  Finally, this is the number one video that I recommend to those new to yoga:  the four different levels of modifications not only make the routine extremely accessible, but also they provide plenty of room to grow as you continue your home practice.  (I've heard that the DVD version is even better for this purpose, as it allows you to focus directly on the instructor who is doing your particular level of modifications.)

Do you think that you're not flexible enough to do yoga?  So did I; this video changed my mind.  Highly recommended!",1026950400,15,2275,4.844961240310077

Soothing music. Minimal instruction and what she says makes sense. Highly recommend.",1026345600,12,520,5.419753086419753

I was nervous when I started because I had injured my neck/back in a car accident a year prior to starting, but believe it or not it helped so much!!! I feel so incredibly great when I am finished! SO completely calmed and relaxed yet energized at the same time. I only wish the video was about 30-35 mins rather that 55 (at times I thinking about everything else I had to do that day and felt I was running low on time) other than that I highly recommend this video.

I too, figured that the 'weight loss' part was a marketing gimic, however I have to say that I have been an avid exerciser most of my life and have never enjoyed slower forms of exercise such as yoga.  After doing this tape every day for a week I have noticed that I feel all my muscles even more than after a weight lifting workout and I'm actually eating better!  There definitly is something to the mind/body/spirit connection in regard to weight loss.  Another yoga tape that I think is fantastic is Yoga Inside&Out with Batshiva.  Hers is a series of 7 30 minute yoga sessions designed to align each of the 7 chakras.  I'm glad I had worked with her tapes for a few months before this tape - but together they have confirmed to me that yoga really is an incredible form of mind/body exercise.

BTW the reason I'm writing here is that a proper diet should be accompanied with practicing yoga in the first place. You should be much more careful if you do yoga to lose some weights.

I love the options for choosing which program you want to follow; it gives me room to develop.

I quickly was eager for something more challenging. Good tape for stress relief but I can't honestly say that this workout is intensive enough for weight loss. Good muscle tone maybe...I recommend this for anyone just starting out and especially those with limited movement.

So I decided to read some of these reviews a little closer, and I found others who have had this problem.  My advice, this would have probably been a good program, but if it won't play, it's of no more use than a drink coaster. Look elsewhere.",1008633600,7,507,3.99009900990099
1349537,5,B00004T6FM,"This is a great program! I have a very basic understanding of yoga, and though this workout is challenging, it wasn't too tough for a relative beginner, like me. The best part about it is that four different ladies are doing the workout, each at a different level - from fully modified to regular workout - and with the DVD, you get to choose which lady you'd like to follow! I enjoy this feature tremendously, as I look forward to moving up the levels.
There is also the ""personal instructor"" feature - during the different poses, an icon will appear in the bottom right corner of your screen, telling you the personal instructor feature is available -- all you have to do is hit enter on your remote and it takes you to the ""yoga studio"" where Suzanne Deason shows you the correct positioning. Then it takes you back to the workout! Neat!
The workout is 45 minutes, but it takes place in 3 sections, and you can choose if you want to do all 3 sections, or any one of them alone.
Some yoga programs move too fast, but this one moves at just the right pace. The explanations of the positions are thorough enough that your eyes don't have to be glued to the TV the whole time. Suzanne Deason is gentle, respectful, and sincere. All in all, a great investment!

Despite the title, you need to incorporate a healthy eating plan, simply doing yoga alone will most likely not produce significant weight loss. However, if you find yourself overeating due to stress, then, this tape would be helpful to you as you should be able to decrease your stress level.
What I like about the tape is the four variations. But, pick only one model and follow her movements throughout the work out. I made the mistake of overestimating my abilities and suddenly switched variations in midstream from a partially modified routine to a full posture (""Hey, y'all, watch this"")and gave myself a rather nasty knee and back pain.

I would not recommend the tape as the DVD has tons of special features that allow you to not only learn each pose as you go through the workout, but also allows you to choose which level you would like to practice.  Its not nearly as rigorous as Living Arts' Power Yoga series, but I like this pace a lot better because its easier for beginners to follow.  ""Beginner"" in yoga does not necessarily mean someone who's never taken a yoga class before.  Remeber, beginner in Power Yoga means someone who can balance on their hands with their feet crossed in the air!
I've been reading some of these comments that say this workout is hard to follow because Deason does not offer instructions on how to move in and out of the poses.  Well, there's a little feature called ""Personal Instructor"" which you can turn on to interrupt the workout and show you the pose.  This feature is clearly discussed in the instructions on how to use this DVD.
Give it time and learn all the cool features about this DVD.  I""ve managed to lose some weight using this DVD and basically nothing else.  I used to wake up and do Tae Bo or some other aerobics.  Yeah, I lost weight... but I've also lost wieght doing yoga and I find that I've gained a greater focus even though I do not practice meditation.

This tape is very well done. The setting, narration, and four levels of instructors (showing you poses simultaniously) is a big help as you progress. The camera work is flawless and you can see all the poses from a distance and then with a closer view.
I do the workout once a day at least six days a week --and I am not bored yet. I progress daily and find that my flexibility and strength are increasing in a gentle manner.

But the most wonderful functionality that you can get in this DVD is the multi-views.  It gives you the ability to gauge your own ability, and follow an instructor that is at your level(fully modified, 1/2 modified, 1/4 modified).  You can start at one level, and change the view when you become stronger and more flexible.  Most surprising, some of the instructors are not model-thin!  Another great feature is the ability to ""drill deeper"" into the pose.  During the workout, you have the option to position the cursor to learn more about the pose - it flips you into a studio view of the main instructor teaching the pose - then it flips back into the workout.

It is exactly what I need after a long busy day at work and running after my 3 year old once I get home.

I've had this for over 2 months now (even had to switch to DVD, which came with a nice booklet!) and not only have I noticed and felt a difference in my body, I'm actually still not tired of video.  In fact, I can do the routine without watching the video anymore but still pop it on the player because I enjoy listening to the relaxing sound of the narration, guiding my ""timing"" and telling me what a certain pose is doing to my body (e.g, the benefits you get from twisting, etc.)
Since this was my first yoga experience, the modified poses (in the background) helped me very much in the beginning.  However, in just a few weeks, I can follow most, if not all, of the full poses.  I also like the mood setting: simple and serious, yet gentle and focused.

I have noticed more flexibility and better tone in my body.  While my scale still reads the same number it did before I started, I do notice a difference in how my clothes fit.  Muscles weighs more than fat, right?  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn yoga for toning, balance, and the spiritual/meditative side of yoga.  The only downside of this tape is that it is a bit longer than I like.  So sometimes I fast-forward to the parts I really want to benefit from.",988848000,,911,4.472727272727273
1349558,5,B00004T6FM,"I have to say how surprised I was that I enjoyed this video as much as I have! The first time I completed the video I felt incredible! I used muscles that have been dormant for awhile.  I did break a sweat, but maintained steady breathing.  I was able to walk, talk, breath, etc....normally the next day which encouraged me to keep it up.  Some workouts leave you feeling so sore and spent that your motivation decreases along with your drive to do it again.  I loved the scenery, music and detailed instruction.

1349563,4,B00004T6FM,"well i have a collection of yoga videos that are for the most part too hard for me to do comfortibally. Some are beautifully shot. Some are inspiring. Some are great to watch -- especially  the women in them (and they are almost always star beautiful women)-- unfortunetally most have left me finding subtle excuses not to practice yoga.  I admit the following :I am a beginner. I am out of shape. I am also a little lazy. This being said, let me also state that I like this video. I find myself wanting to do Yoga everyday. I find myself enjoying the Asanas. sweating , and streaching and really getting involved in yoga.  I get the feeling with Suzan's tape that she is really aiming to try and teach you, with care, patience and even maybe a little love. Seeing how good shape she is, it would be very easy for her to make one of those other tapes where the teacher blasts off into the upper realms of yoga Pretzeldom, but Suzan stays with us humble beginners, giving us options, attainable goals, and a work out that even I can do -- and enjoy.",988675200,24,1048,4.336734693877551
1349564,4,B00004T6FM,"I purchased this video last week and have done the work out almost every day.  I find it easy to follow and the four levels of instruction helps a lot. I could never touch my toes, even as a child, so I used that as a measuring block. So far I've gone from 9"" from the ground to 5"" - and thats in 1 week!!  so far so good.
On the downside, its a little long(45 minutes) and hard to fit into a busy day.  It would be nice if it included a 20 minute routine along with it for those days when you don't have an hour to spare!  Also, I didn't know I'd need a block or strap until I started the video.  Its getting a little old already (ok so thats what i get for doing it everyday!) but I figure if I get a couple more workouts to mix into my routine it will keep me from getting boring.  Definately great for beginners!!  (and surprisingly enough I did break a sweat!).",987465600,7,866,3.914285714285714
1349565,5,B00004T6FM,"Of course this moves slowly! This workout is geared for those who are new to Yoga. It is meant to be steady and relaxing. They move fluently from one position to the next and yet allow you time to move into the proper position and steady yourself. Also, the extra time in the poses are meant to help us beginners increase flexibility and learn stability and focus.
The workout moves from sitting to standing poses and then down to ground. The music is soothing and she not only explains the postures, but she also notes what some of the postures help with (digestion, releasing toxins, etc.).
I am happy to have this in my collection and I use it 2 times every week. I have already moved up a level from my starting. I recommended this to my mother who has had neck surgery and is not very flexible. The fully modified version will be perfect for her since the stretches are so gentle and mild.",986342400,61,894,4.391566265060241
1349566,5,B00004T6FM,"I bought this tape about 3 weeks ago. I am very tight in the upper body and hips. Having practiced yoga off and on for about 3 years, I still find this tape terrific. Another reviewer said the twisting poses did nothing for them, but I have exactly the opposite opinion. They are my favorite part of the workout. I also have carpal tunnel and the poses in this tape do not aggravate it as some others do. This isn't for people who are looking to break a sweat, but for anyone who has tight muscles or who just wants a somewhat challenging yet relaxing yoga workout I highly recommend this one.",985478400,5,593,4.303571428571429
1349567,4,B00004T6FM,"Very good for the beginner. Good way to start exersising if you have not done it for a while. The highest of 4 available levels is appropriate for an advanced beginner. For most of the poses more detailed guidance is available, they call it ""personal trainer"". The only complaint is that the time allowed for the poses is sometimes not enough. When I do stretching poses I prefer to stay in them for longer than allowed here. But overall it is good yoga DVD and is great if you just start practising yoga.",983836800,,505,4.440860215053763

The continuous showing of multiple variations is very helpful for beginners and those who may have the anatomical incumberances of a few extra bulges.  I suspect that the weight loss title is a gimmick to sell the video. For those like me who already know some yoga, but have embraced the ""food is God concept"" a little too well perhaps it is time to move on to Ashtanga. There now seems to be a formula to sell yoga videos. 1.) Get instructors 2) Go to pristine natural setting, blue sky with few clouds highly recommended 3) play relaxing music in background. This one fits that formula as do most recent videos. The Arizona canyon lands is a pleasing background.",981158400,9,715,4.5859375
1349569,5,B00004T6FM,"I can't recommend this program highly enough.  For those of us new to yoga and for whom exercise is but a dim memory, this gently encouraging workout will have you hooked before you know it.  Four levels of intensity are demonstrated for each pose.  This accomplishes two things: 1) it doesn't scare people away who can't tuck their ankles behind their heads just yet, and 2) it provides incentive to strive for the next level.  For those who complain that this program is just so much eyewash, please remember the three areas a well-rounded exercise regimen should address:  strength training, aerobic conditioning, and flexibility.  ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" is an energizing way to achieve the latter while being, dare I say it, ... fun!",980899200,33,750,4.96

I was looking for a DVD specifically because I hate rewinding VHS tapes and I love the extra features that are sometimes available. This DVD is wonderful but sometimes does not give you enough time to move into the poses. Perhaps when I have practiced more it will become easier, but for the moment it is somewhat difficult to look at the screen and contort myself at the same time. All in all, I have enjoyed using it and after only two weeks of regular use I can already see more muscle definition in my arms and legs. I would definitely recommend this edition but suggest watching it through a few times before using.",978739200,14,704,4.340909090909091

I really like this Yoga Conditioning DVD so far. The ability to set it on one of 4 levels and see only that level is what DVD is all about. I hadn't worked out in months so I didn't go through the whole workout yet, but I find her voice very soothing, words very helpful, scenery not bad. The sequencing of poses is very smooth.

I found the postures  easy to master and I had only done one yoga class before buying this tape!  This video really challenges you yet makes you feel comfortable right from  the start. This tape was much more inviting than any other tape I have  reviewed so far (I've seen four others) and the backdrop makes you wish you  could be right there with them. I recommend this video with much confidence  but want to stress that I didn't really find this to be a useful tool for  weight loss.  I think that the video should be renamed to Total Focus,  Relaxation, and Flexability for Yoga Beginners!",968284800,40,720,4.496124031007752

You will NOT lose weight.  This is NOT an aerobic yoga  tape.  If you want to use yoga to lose weight, try Ashtanga yoga or Power  yoga. Skip this tape.  If you are an absolute beginner, then try Yoga  Journal's Yoga for beginners.  This tape is just taking advantage of the  millions in hawking weight loss products to mostly women.",968198400,19,504,4.3478260869565215
1349574,3,B00004T6FM,"I would first love for someone to answer a question for me if possible:  Why do they warn menstuating women not to do inverted or twisting poses?  I  thought that was very odd and it goes against everything I know about  excersise.  I have another yoga tape and have not seen this warning and I  took yoga all through HS and don't remember anyone saying this.
Now for  the video.  First of all, running time is 60 minutes, but that includes the  instructions at the beginning and the credits.  I felt this video could  have been slightly longer with more poses.  Then again, I like longer  workouts in general . . .  I also wish they would have focused in on each  of the modifications more.  Sometimes it was hard to see what someone was  doing.
When I did this video, I mixed up the variations, using all four  at different points due to my varying degrees of flexibility.  I think this  is an excellent way to make a yoga video, because you have to work up to  being so limber, so you can use this video for a long time as you get more  flexible and obtain more balance.  Also, Suzanne Deason is beautiful to  watch and it's nice to see her as a role model on the screen.  She is  graceful, flexible, and so happy when she is doing yoga!  I also liked the  fact that there were many body types involved.  I hate seeing all skinny  people in my excersise videos.
Overall, a good workout, but I probably  won't use it forever . . .",966124800,24,1432,4.231343283582089

The ""front matter"" was interesting once; I only  rewound it to the beginning of the exercise portion after that (eject at  the beginning of the exercise, pop it back in, and then use zero-return to  come back to the starting point).

If you're  someone just starting yoga or have very tight thighs and hips, the Fully  modified practice can be used.  If you're an experienced yoga student, you  could choose the Complete Workout.  If you're somewhere in between or are  simply feeling a little sore or tight in certain posses, you can quickly  modify the instruction to slightly or partially modified with the push of a  button. (Thanks to DVD technology!) Additionally, there is clear and  precise instruction concerning proper breath which is the halmark of  quality yoga.
