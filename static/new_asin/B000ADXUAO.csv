8078197,5,B000ADXUAO,"Fun exciting music, and the libretto touches on issues Europeans argued over, but governments banned-  Just fun 1920's style jazz, beautiful opera level singing, melodic arias, great opera (without the tragedy), so it's called light opera or operetta, it is not just comedy like Rossini's opera buffa, but music serious and joyful.  Music arias by this composer are bel-canto like.",1386460800,,381,5.333333333333333
8078198,5,B000ADXUAO,"Fantastic, incredible, better than first rate singing, dancing and costumes.  Best watched with the subtitles turned off. This was Kalman's answer to the New York musical.  It begins with a Charleston and ends with a slow foxtrot with lots of dancing, singing and German dialog as well as waltzes and a czardas or two. The costumes, lighting and sound are wonderful.  No to be missed.",1268697600,,384,4.876923076923077
8078199,5,B000ADXUAO,"I love this score and this product is beautifully done.  The penultimate number by Ms. Burgess and Mr. Matic - like dope.

My only complaint, the characters are somewhat lacking in warmth, as compared to those on the Bonynge sound recording.",1215993600,,241,4.853658536585366
8078200,5,B000ADXUAO,"I had the opportunity of seeing this production at the Volksoper in Vienna with the cast on this DVD.  It's just plain fun!  The quality of the DVD is excellent, the costumes gorgeous and the singing superb.  The only negative is the presence of the body mikes.  Hopefully Amazon will be able to get this back in stock....but try Google - there are other sources!",1190419200,,363,4.538461538461538
