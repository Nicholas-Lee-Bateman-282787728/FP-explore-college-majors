8326915,2,B001NGMAOY,"A little disappointed in that Jason is not as good a speaker as I was led to believe....he uses the word ""like"" wat too much! Very distracting....message is good and I plan to use parts of it!",1433548800,,192,4.216216216216216

8326918,5,B001NGMAOY,"This DVD is the best and most positive presentation regarding love and relationships that I have ever seen or heard - and, I have seen a lot.  It makes a powerful impact on those who watch it.  Girls and guys alike love it; as it is light, positive, easy to understand, relative, and uses a lot of humor.  Unlike many videos that just say DON'T do this or that, this ground breaking thought calls people and challenges them to find the highest kind of love, the love that you were meant for, a love that is completely fulfilling and guilt free.  Jason speaks with his wife (then fiance), and since they both come from two totally different places, they reach people of all different places and backgrounds, no matter what they have been through.  I have heard of playboy bunnies and other cases some might consider ""hopeless"" who have turned their lives around and have chosen to live lives of love, purity and respect after watching this presentation.  It's powerful, beautiful, and presented in such a down-to-earth, positive, funny, and non-judgmental way!

On a personal not, as a religion teacher, I had to teach morality and love to classes of high school seniors, all BOYS. They resisted my message for a long time trying to justify their actions.  I tried a different approach.  I showed them this video and it changed many of their lives.  All were impacted by it, and it made all of them see things differently, more clearly.  They heard the message of love and respect in a way they could relate to, and many of them rose to the challenge of wanting to live a higher form of love. Even the captain of the football team expressed his great interest in the happily-ever-after kind of love.  While it is meant for teens, I highly recommend it for everyone.

Side note: If people are concerned about them mentioning of God or religious things once in a great while, (though it's not that much at all) I believe they have another version too, the same video but without any reference to God in it.",1341878400,,2003,4.592696629213483
8326919,4,B001NGMAOY,"Excellent DVD discussing the importance of sex in our faith lives and why we should save our sexuality for our spouses.  Funny, thought-provoking, authentic, I enjoyed it and so did the teens in my youth group!",1330732800,,210,4.833333333333333
8326920,5,B001NGMAOY,"Great DVD!  The Everets do an amazing job of keeping everyone entertained, AND well informed.  No scare tactics, just fun, honest and straightforward talk- including sharing of their own life experiences.  This DVD is not only for Catholics :).

You may want to view it first to ascertain whether your child is mature enough ... boys do mature a bit slower than girls.

I highly recommend that this DVD be viewed by parents w/ their teen boys and girls 13+.  That's how I used it and found that it was a great way to answer questions and have a discussion w/ my child about some ""uncomfortable"" sexual subjects.

Of course this will depend on your comfort level and type of communication you have w/ your teen.  However it is sooo worth it!  I'd rather have my kid get the real information from me and not her/his peers.

I loaned my copy to a (non-Catholic) friend to view it w/ her child, whom Loved it and asked for a copy as a birthday gift.  IT's THAT good!!

Even if you are uncomfortable in having an honest and open discussion about sex w/ your teen, he/she could still view it alone and benefit TREMENDOUSLY from it.",1299024000,6,1125,4.46078431372549
8326921,5,B001NGMAOY,"This is an excellent DVD! All of my children have watched it and it held their interest for the whole hour. The material is presented in such a dynamic way, you just can't walk away. Every eye was glued to the screen. I work with 10th graders, and have shown this DVD for many years. Jason and Crystlina Evert make a fascinating team, providing both sides of a serious issue that must be faced by every young person out there. I have watched this DVD about 15 or 20 times, and Jason is so funny that it never gets old. And he never fails to hit a home run, and really make teens think ....""Wow, I never thought about it that way before! I guess I should consider that, before I...""
This is a must have resource for every family, church, CCD, youth group, counselor, high school...any one who cares about young people, or our culture today, should own this and spread the word! Awesome resource.",1289779200,5,894,4.391566265060241
8326922,5,B001NGMAOY,"There is no much nonsense being put out on sexuality, and one can look a long time before finding something with substance.  This is a presentation to high school students by people who are living what they are saying.  It is based on extensive research as well as personal experience, and presented in a compelling and entertaining way.  It does not shy away from the hard questions, and can get a bit explicit, but only in the service of teaching. It is NOT boring, and does not require anyone to accept any assumptions without question.",1255305600,6,539,4.652631578947369
