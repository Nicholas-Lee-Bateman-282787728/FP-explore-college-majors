2067282,5,B00028A672,"I wanted my 4-year old to start learning a foreign language now since most people seem to think the earlier, the better.  Spanish seemed the obvious choice since it's so useful for career and travel.
I am buying her a variety of tools so that she maintains her interest in learning the language. Since she loves her Wiggles videos, I knew she would enjoy this learning format.  She really enjoys ""Learn Spanish with Carlos and Chiquita"" and wants to watch the DVD over and over again.  The characters are appealing and the music is fantastic - especially the salsa song with the farm animal sounds.
The video is broken down into six vignettes showing different daily situations.  I liked the fact that the video not only shows what kids say, but also what parents say to kids.  I ""role-played"" some of the lines with my daughter (I picked up some Spanish as well).  She is also repeating some of the phrases in the video on her own.
The accompanying learning booklet is easy to read and not overwhelming.  Overall, a fun and useful learning tool.",1087689600,9,1046,4.621621621621622
2067283,5,B00028A672,"I am thrilled with ""Learn Spanish with Carlos and Chiquitita"".  My Son Steven and I both enjoyed the fun energetic format.  Although I bought it for my son, I also benefited from the lesson plans. I was most pleased and surprised with just how much I learned from the simple and upbeat musical pieces.  My son is still singing them this morning.  He was so enthralled with the DVD that he has been asking for his own Chiquitita. I am sure we will go through this curriculum again and again.  It is a wonderful product.  Thank you very much Language Tree.

2067284,5,B00028A672,"""Learn Spanish with Carlos & Chiquitita"" is a great product for  learning spanish and also reinforcing other positive behaviors with children such as cleaning up your toys, being kind to pets and good hygiene.
Your going to love Chiquitita and see results with your kids spanish speaking abilities...",1085702400,4,300,5.25
2067285,1,B00028A672,"This DVD is terrible!  The graphics are awful, the pace is too fast, and their is nothing appealing about the characters.  I am a Spanish speaker and a Speech/Language Pathologist, I decided to buy this for my 4 year old to aid in her acquisition of the language. She did not even make it through the first 5 minutes and I can't blame her.  Who really cares if a duck says Cuac Cuac?  Instead of introducing words like ""mama"" and ""papa"" in isolation first it begins with sentences.  The whole video is in Sapnish except for an intro to each section, since my child does not know Sapnish and is being told sentences with no explanation she was not able to follow along.

This DVD is definitly not worth the price!!!",1135468800,18,714,4.412213740458015
2067286,4,B00028A672,"Que dice el pato?  From watching this just one time I learned how to ask my son what the animals say, and he knows what I am saying.  The video is primitive yes, but as another reviewer said, the kids like it.  The sound quality gets very loud during the songs and you have to keep turning it down, so it is a little pricey.  However if it had perfect sound quality the price would be worth it.  I think this is one video that we can watch over and over and over again and learn something/reinforced every time.  The scenes are all relevant, bathing, playing with sister, animal identification, family, etc.  I would recommend buying this, just don't overlook the sound and the animation.  I didn't like it at first, but the more I watch it with my son, the more I see he is learning from it (and I am too), and that is what is important.",1129161600,14,838,4.226415094339623
2067287,4,B00028A672,This is a great introduction to spanish video. My kids are 3 y/o and 20 months and they both love it. The songs have a catchy tune that keeps them occupied.  I took Spanish for 5 years and it is a good review for me as well. The only con I have is that the sound quality is inconsistent. Sometimes it projects really loud and other times you can barely hear it so I probably have a defective DVD that I just do not feel like bothering to send back and pay for shipping. Overall this is a great product and I would recommend it.,1127865600,8,527,4.019047619047619
2067288,5,B00028A672,I teach Spanish and many of my parents want to start their kids before they enter elementary school.  I have recommended this one to them and all seem pleased.  Great for youngsters starting out.,1124064000,9,195,4.705882352941177
2067289,5,B00028A672,"We are just starting to teach our four and five year olds Spanish, so we bought a few teaching aids, including Learn Spanish with Carlos & Chiquitita. Some items didn't take, but the kids really enjoy this video! The animation is fairly primitive, but for some reasons the kids really like it. The video packs a lot into a half hour (the family, vowels/animals, parts of the body, food, basic phrases, etc.) and the dialog intersperses some more challenging word along the way, so the kids learn more the more they watch. The DVD works particularly well at combining entertaining songs with animation, which our kids ask to watch again and again. It also comes with a helpful guide book to help parents, and includes subtitles in English and Spanish, to help parents who don't know Spanish. I only wish this company had more than one Spanish teaching aid!",1106956800,48,855,4.74496644295302
2067290,5,B00028A672,"I found this DVD to be a well-done and creative introduction to a very useful language.  New vocabulary and phrases are introduced within the context of different ""sketches"" where the cartoon characters are in different situations (at dinner, at the farm, in the playroom, before going to sleep).  Therefore, what is being taught is generally quite practical.  My daughter can now say ""please pass me the bread"" in Spanish and answers with ""gracias"".  This DVD may be a little fast-paced for younger children, but was appropriate for my 8-year old daughter.  Since I don't speak Spanish, I found it very helpful that an English-speaking narrator (a funny lizard) sets up each scene.  The dialogues, however, are completely in Spanish which was fine because we understood the context. We need more educational tools like this one.",1098576000,32,829,5.103703703703704
2067291,4,B00028A672,"I am a single mother of a two year old daughter living in Chula Vista, California.  I am wanting my daughter to learn and speak another language, spanish, other than english.  After purchasing ""Learn Spanish with Carlos & Chiquitita"" and practicing the spanish with my daughter, I am amazed at how quickly she and I are learning spanish together.  The DVD has made learning fun and easy.",1098230400,26,387,4.746268656716418
2067292,5,B00028A672,I have watched your Spanish DVD and really enjoyed it.  I found the storybook approach to teaching a language to be quite easy to follow.  The interactivity of the lessons made it enjoyable and entertaining.  I think this is a great product and a quality video.,1097625600,10,261,4.630434782608695
2067293,5,B00028A672,"I am using this DVD, along with books and audio tapes, to teach Spanish to my 10-year old son at home.  After watching this DVD a few times, he can already speak a few phrases in Spanish.  Most importantly, he's doing so without any prompting from me.  The format of this DVD is engaging and at a good pace for beginner students of Spanish.  The focus is on the use of the language within different scenarios.  I found this DVD to be an effective home teaching tool.",1097366400,8,466,4.310344827586207
2067294,5,B00028A672,"My 18 month old child loves this video.  At first, I did not like the poor animation and found the English narrator and subtitles to be distracting.  However, now I love it and think that the songs are quite catchy.  I still wish there was a function on the DVD to get rid of the subtitles.",1097020800,8,290,4.142857142857143

8023566,2,B00028A672,"This was done very poorly and my kids are not even slightly amused.  They jump at a chance to watch anything on the TV, because we have no channels, and they asked me to turn it off.
Poor sound, so the annunciation during the songs is not discernible.  The music is louder than the words, which is typical of Hispanic music, but not really functional here, lol.
Pay a little more and get a better program.
I thought it would be good for the car entertainment system, but it's a little too unnerving for driving.
It seemed to me it would be something with a story-line, maybe about a boy and his dog, but it's not really.  I'm sure my kids will get it's worth in a few words learned, concerning parts of the family and how to chat about the number of people in it, though.  Not a total loss maybe?",1360022400,,796,4.217105263157895
8023567,4,B00028A672,"I am an adult learning Spanish the first time for myself.  I got the DVD from the library as suppliment of other audio and visual material I am using.

I wasn't very impressed with the animation, and the voice for the blue snake-like animal doesn't sound very energetic.  but I do like the songs, they are very catchy, and designed to incorporate the whole lesson in the song.  I wish there are one song every lesson but little disappointed that lesson 4 and 5 don't have them.  The booklet is helpful in reviewing the key phrases in the lesson.

I do think the dvd is fun, I would especially play them over and over just to hear the songs, but since I am not the intended audience I am not sure how much my experience would help the people seeking advices here.",1181433600,2,762,4.330985915492958
8023568,1,B00028A672,We have tried them all and this DVD was a disapointment.  The animation was really bad as well as some of the articulation.  Some situations did not relate to very young ones and it would not hold the attention of my child.,1152144000,6,223,4.285714285714286
8023569,4,B00028A672,Very helpful and easy to follow. Prefer to have more written spanish language to help,1141862400,6,85,4.733333333333333
8023570,1,B00028A672,"I sat and viewed this DVD with my son. He paid attention the entire video. But I thought it was boring and very cheap and poorly put together. The information of what its teaching is good, but the production quality is very low.",1141776000,14,228,4.325581395348837
8023571,3,B00028A672,Not as good as ROCK N' LEARN:SPANISH but your kids or you can still learn some good stuff. Also the DVD was a little shorter than I expected.,1141344000,11,141,4.071428571428571
8023572,5,B00028A672,"I am a native Spanish speaker and I am very interested in teaching Spanish to my 2 year-old son, however it is hard when most of his verbal stimulation is in English. I was very happy to find Carlos & Chiquitita. My son loves the characters and follows the stories very well. The music is also very helpful in keeping him engaged. We only let him watch 30 minutes of TV per day and he keeps asking for this DVD.",1137974400,6,411,4.15
8023573,3,B00028A672,"I bought this to review it for my students - I had some mothers ask me if I thought it would be a good teaching aid. So here's my take on it, as a Spanish teacher:

 As a reinforcer to a Spanish class for 3 to 5 or 6 year olds, I think it's a good DVD. It is quite short for the money, but you can bet that the children will get more out of it each time they watch. Alone, I don't know how helpful it willl be - maybe to motivate your child to want to learn more. As an addition to Flip Flop Spanish (a workbook my students use with a CD) it fits very well, and adds a lot - presenting the information in a new format.

All in all, you can find better sources for less money, but my three children (ages 4, 2, and 1) did sit through it and repeat a lot of the words, but I speak to them in Spanish frequently, so it didn't give them anything new.
