7704905,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Extremely well done.  The Russo brothers have definitely raised the bar in the MCU.  They presented both sides of the conflict extremely well and made you identify with each character.  This movie was not overwhelming in any way with the many characters (like Avengers - Age of Ultron seemed), and instead gave specific, mostly limited roles to each character while leaving the bulk of the movie about Captain America, Iron Man and Bucky.  It also set up Spiderman and The Black Panther very well, and like the Russo brothers last movie, the ending wrapped up the movie well while at the same time leaving you in anticipation of their next film.",1462492800,7,645,4.783783783783784

7704913,2,B01D9EUNB4,"Why is it that I can still watch Bakshi's Spider-Man or even S-M and His Amazing Friends and be entertained and yet this? With all their special effects the whole film plays out like so much braindead fluff. And you can tell that the casting all revolves around Hollywood's idea of who should be accounted for and represented instead of who can act and look the part. Tim Meadows is normally fantastic but he doesn't belong in this universe of super heroes playing it real. I keep seeing him as The Ladies Man. And of course, sarcastic drugged out nihilist Downey JR is no exception to this rule. Although people apparently really like him in the role. And folks in Malibu enjoy him in their dumpsters after a night of partying.

I'll stick to the comics of years back. This other stuff is a mess.",1534636800,,797,4.496551724137931

7704934,5,B01D9EUNB4,"As super-powered beings have become more common, and the ensuing battles between them more frequent and more wracked with collateral damage, a number of people have been becoming increasingly wary over all the superheroes operating without a specific mandate.  After an Avengers mission in Nigeria goes horribly awry, these concerns crystallize into a government-backed plan to have the Avengers register and submit to the authority of the United Nations.  Several members, informally led by Iron Man, back this idea, while others, spearheaded by Captain America, are opposed.  After a new disaster in Wakanda, plus behind-the-scenes machinations by other players, the debate spirals from theoretical talking point into full-out conflict between the two sides, with various characters from the Marvel Universe (several making their MCU debuts) brought in to bolster each faction.  As with the comics crossover it's based on, Captain America: Civil War finds neither side being either completely right or completely wrong.  Actually, I think it's more even here than the crossover was.  It's a multi-faceted movie, with characters on both sides of the equation getting a chance to shine in both high-level action and in character-oriented subplots.  It's one of the keystone pieces to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe, and seeing this one actually helps you appreciate even more the other movies and where they're coming from.  This is one of the best entries in the rich wave of comic book adaptations we've been seeing over recent years.  10/10",1532390400,,1548,5.390041493775934

The movie is not perfect, but it's lots of fun. Besides, what else do you want from an action, comic book blockbuster film?

recommended to me to previously watch Civil War and Black Panther, in order to better 'understand' the latest plot.  Well, the plot of Civil War
was confusing enough for me for the super-heroes antagonizing each other like a common street gang of some seedy neighborhood.
I entertained myself watching the whole bunch of special effects, but the writers of Marvel Comics have to squeeze their brains harder to make
more convincing plots to be appealing to a wider audience.",1529020800,,620,5.009708737864078

I don't know how much you know about Marvel and their stories but you must not like them to understand. It's a good story and just because the good guys aren't being ""Good"" that doesn't mean it's a bad example of a Movie. This is more for the adults that grew up reading and collecting comics. Maybe you should be reviewing Disney movies!!

Better by far than the previous and slightly disjointed film in the franchise, Age of Ultron; and even better than the original and well crafted first Avenger's film. Although I was a huge fan of the previous Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) who was leaps and bounds better than Toby Macquire's awful portrayal, Tom Holland won me over by being incredibly...incredible as Peter Parker. He and Paul Rudd (Antman) add a much needed comical element to the somber theme of the film. Everyone does a great job acting, but it's the story that manages to pull off the difficult task of pitting superhero versus superhero in a believable and non-contrived manner. Well choreographed and full of fun action, I'd recommend this movie as the best in the Avenger's Franchise so far!

7705019,1,B01D9EUNB4,"I'll preface this with I'm not really into superhero movies (so maybe I just don't ""get it""), but have really enjoyed the ""big"" ones like Spiderman, Batman, Ironman, etc... Wanted to watch something from just before when Black Panther takes place so I'm not completely lost.

Unfortunately, this movie was a joke. I read reviews before purchasing that called the dialogue ""witty."" It is comical! The reason they're fighting is entirely unclear - like, I get they have that conflict over who is right or wrong, but they can't talk for a minute and sort it out? The entire basis of the conflict is unbelievable. Plus let us also consider that if these superheroes are all so unstable that a slight disagreement leads them to destroying cities, airports, etc... while fighting then they should all be locked up forever!! I also just have to say, Paul Rudd? Really?

And finally, the ""big reveal"" left me siding 100% with the ""villain"" of the movie. Bizarre. No longer looking forward to Black Panther.",1523404800,,998,4.830409356725146

The plot addressed my main issue with the Avengers, namely that they seem to do an unacceptable amount of damage to the property and lives they are supposed to be protecting.
This one also filled in a couple connections with Black Panther and I am sure will help in understanding Infinity War.

7705022,1,B01D9EUNB4,"What a terrible plot. The first 30 minutes of the movie is the ""Good Guys"" being blamed for the actions of the ""Bad Guys"". And the ""Good Guys"" take it like they can't argue with such moronic logic and clear blame shifting. The supposedly intelligent characters (not actors or writers) can't see through the stupidity and defend their actions. It was sickening to watch.

Then the end is that there are no ""Good Guys"" we're all evil criminals anyway. Funny, these are the same arguments being spun by the anti-American anti-Freedom anti-gun shrill voices of Marxism for slavery.

I didn't think I could get more disgusted with Hollywood until I watched this terrible anti-American anti-Freedom plot. Let us submit ourselves to a one world order tyrant (communist bureaucracy) without any freedom or be a wanted criminal. No Thanks Hollywood  anti-American anti-Freedom Marxists.

7705043,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Oddly, the best Avengers film is called ""Captain America: Civil War."" Largely dispensing with villains, the film pits established heroes against one another, exposing differences in their values. The dangerous Winter Soldier turns out to be merely a tragic puppet. Even puppet-master Arnim Zola lashes out from at the Avengers from understandable grief. As a result, the film has more at stake, feels more urgent, and develops characters more significantly than any previous ""Avengers"" film. (Like the character Winter Solder, much of ""Civil War""'s tone and many of its themes come from the previous ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."")

The schism dividing the two camps in ""Civil War"" boils down to a conflict between:
1) An ethic of personal conscience or responsibility espoused by Steve Rogers, and
2) An ethic of responsibility to others articulated by a chastened Tony Stark.
Of course, many secondary characters seem to simply follow the personality they respect more--Stark's or Rogers'. And some find the choice too agonizing to commit to. Zola and T'Challa (The Black Panther) simply pursue their own personal vendettas, literal ""avengers.""

My takeaway: I feel like the choice the movie suggests between accountability to others and one's own conscience is false. We need others' moral input to keep our personal moral compasses working.

After all, remember your Spider-Man catechism: Secretary of State Ross may be a jerk, but he's paraphrasing Ben Parker when he suggests to the Avengers that irresponsible, unaccountable power is dangerous.

And why *should* we trust all of these powerful people to work best without supervision? SHIELD, the organization that *created* the Avengers, turned out to be thoroughly infiltrated by the terrorist group HYDRA. The team had to develop tech (armor) and psych (hypnotic keyword?) measures to contain a founding member, the Hulk. Stark actually created the Ultron AI they had to fight in Sokovia.

And why do we imagine that the only possible ""checks and balances"" on these powerful people must be the Guantanamo-like ""Raft""? I just don't find this a plausible scenario--it seems trumped-up, a straw-man point. The Avengers have enormous wealth, advanced technology, espionage skills, and raw force at their disposal. I simply don't believe that they would sign themselves into helplessness. In reality, Stark is right: people this powerful would negotiate over their freedom of movement, their rules of engagement, their legal redress, any possible punishments. I don't mean that I want to see the whole legal negotiation onscreen: I just mean that I feel like I'm being asked to believe that power can both be innocent and gives up without a fight. I just don't believe either of those things. That's why I believe in checks and balances.

And that's why I kind of wince at the idea of Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers, here. I mean, the film has him stand for unaccountable power. What he does is between him and his conscience and that's that. No law will stop him, so long as he thinks he's right. And it's not like he's a coscientious objector, willing to face the consequences--i.e., go to prison for peacefully protesting an unjust law. No, he's pretty much saying he knows best and wants the freedom to act outside the law according to his own lights. We just have to trust him. No checks, no balances.

But how do you know whether your conscience is really clean if no one is there to check your ego? To tell you when you're full of it? Especially if you're powerful?",1520208000,2,3535,5.074010327022375

7705054,1,B01D9EUNB4,"Civil War opens with a bunch of characters we've never seen before all fighting each other over possession of... something. We're never properly introduced to ANY of them, we don't even know which ones are the good guys and which ones are the bad guys until the scene is over, we're not told exactly what the thing is that they're fighting over or why they want it (though it seems to be some kind of biological or chemical weapon), and the scene itself does absolutely nothing to move the plot forward. And this, in a nutshell, perfectly encapsulates everything that is wrong with the entire rest of the movie: the plot makes no sense and we have 20 or 30 new characters dumped on us without any proper introduction. The only ones who DO get properly introduced are Black Panther and Spider-Man, but seriously, did Spider-Man even NEED an introduction after he had 5 movies already, 2 of which were origin stories? Wouldn't that time have been better spent on telling us who that one guy is who's kind of like Black Panther except that he's a bird and not a panther? Or that chick who I would have assumed was Jean Grey if the rights to the X-Men weren't being held by Fox at the time? Or maybe reminding us who the heck Ant-Man is, for those of us who are NOT the 5 or 6 people who bothered to watch the Ant-Man solo movie? And speaking of wasted running time, there's an entire scene dedicated to Vision being unable to figure out whether he's cooking with paprika or some other spice. YEAH THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. I WATCH AVENGERS MOVIES TO SEE SUPERHEROES COOKING WITH PAPRIKA. THAT WAS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN TELLING ME WHO THE HECK ALL THESE NEW CHARACTERS ARE. I suppose that I can forgive Civil War for not introducing Bucky, because Bucky is apparently a ""Winter Soldier"", and the previous Captain America movie was titled ""The Winter Soldier"", so I'm assuming that Bucky was introduced in that one. But everyone else? No. Fail.

So, aside from that, the plot is beyond stupid. Basically, the idea is that the Avengers are causing a lot of collateral damage when saving the world, and so the UN wants to pass a non-binding resolution about superhero registration or something. Iron Man and Captain America have a difference of opinion on whether or not this is a good idea. Quick question: when was the last time you and your best friend got into a fist fight over a non-binding UN resolution? Probably never. But if you had, what are the chances that all of your other friends would have picked sides and joined the brawl? Probably zero, right? And yet all of these extra characters end up joining the fight even though half of them have never even met Iron Man or Captain America before. If I remember correctly, Ant-Man didn't even want to join the fight. He got kidnapped and conscripted by one side. Why he didn't ditch them at the soonest opportunity, I'll never know. But that's how utterly insanely stupid this movie is.",1519430400,,2942,4.582542694497154

7705079,2,B01D9EUNB4,"Let me start by saying that I love superhero movies...when they're well done. This movie isn't.

It's too long by at least 30 minutes, the plot is extremely weak, some of the newer superhero characters just don't fit, a couple of them are terrible, and the fights scenes are so frequent and similar that they just become repetitive and actually boring.

The newer additions; the version of Spiderman in this movie is awful. I know he's supposed to be a teenager and so nave and irreverent but he just comes off as annoying and actually kind of stupid. The witch girl (I can't even recall her name) is much more suited for one of the X-men movies, she doesn't fit at all in an Avengers movie, she was glaringly out of place. And Ant Man, I know Ant Man goes way back, I remember his comics as a kid. I found them absurd then and I still do. My wife, who is just a casual fan of these types of movies but had really liked some of them actually laughed out loud when Ant Man showed up, and not in a good way. Paul Rudd is a good comedic actor and he does his best but, Ant Man should have been left in the pages of his seldom read comic books.

As stated earlier, the fight scenes were so frequent and similar that they became meaningless. I mean, they spend half the movie pounding on one another to no appreciable outcome; no one dies, no one is seriously injured (yes, I know War Hammer is but by the scene at the end of the credits he's already getting better), the fights are pointless. They're also silly; Black Widow asks another character if they're still friends, while she's trying to beat him senseless...stupid. Captain America and Spider-boy bond because one's from Queens and the other from Brooklyn...even more stupid.

The impression I got from this movie was that someone from Marvel thought it would be cool if all the super heroes started fighting with each other but they couldn't come up with a viable plot to make that happen...so they came up with the semi-plot in this movie. Suddenly Iron Man and Captain America are sworn enemies, even though everyone knows, including Iron Man, that he's mistaken about the reason they started fighting in the first place.

7705093,4,B01D9EUNB4,"As a new phase of Marvel films begins a new feeling started to grip us as fans of the MCU and that is the feeling of mediocrity. After Batman v. Superman there were many that were ready for a new Marvel film which would give us our favorites as well as some new faces carrying on the story that began in 2008 and while Captain America: Civil War is a good watch there is a lot lacking. A story that should be just as dramatic as Batman v Superman is an entertaining ride filled with way too many jokes and too much light heartedness. Captain America and Iron Man are at each other's throats but, they only are caught up in a massive tickle fight until closer to the end of the film. There is a very weak underused villain in Daniel Bruel playing Baron Zemo and a great deal of underuse with characters such as Scarlet Witch & Vision. While it is great to see newcomers like Black Panther and finally see Spider-Man arrive in the MCU there is still a great deal to be desired. When you get to the massive airport battle that pits hero against hero you just don't get the drama that one would expect to get regardless of how many awesome things happen.

I've seen every film in the universe, but was totally confused for the first 20 minutes, trying to figure out who was who, and what was going on.  I then sat through 40 minutes of something that should have been on CNN at 2am.  Then about 20 minutes of ONE OF THE BEST FIGHT SCENES IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, STARRING EVERYBODY FROM EVERY MOVIE (Like the Avengers 1 final battle), followed by 40 minutes of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers crying and arguing like 5 year olds.  Skip to the fight scene and don't bother watching the rest of the film.  Everyone hates everyone now; that's everything you need to know for Infinity War.",1514332800,,895,4.426829268292683

This movie was awesome and I will look at it again and again! I did feel sad about the disagreement among them all but there was some humor in it.

The overall movie was good, with few continuity errors, spectacular costume design for Chadwick Boseman/Black Panther, and a gigantic, Avenger vs. Avenger cage match in the latter half of the movie. The villain was slightly lackluster, but his plan ultimately succeeded. Towards the end of the movie, at 2:03:16, the Amazon video version of the movie detects a continuity error where there wasn't one, given that the suit Tony Stark is wearing allows him to put his helmet on via the interface screen",1499904000,,751,5.319327731092437

7705264,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Not much I can say that hasn't been said. Yeah, Cap's romantic scenes fail and Zemo's plan came together too neatly in the end. But it's still one of the most spectacular comic book films ever made. (BTW, chatting up your ex's niece at her funeral is just a little tacky). But here are a few things I loved:
-  Themes: Too many hollywood films glorify violence and revenge. This movie takes pains to show the cost of these battles, and the decisions the characters make. It's not about good vs evil here. The decision made at the end about revenge is perfect. I love that Zemo is a complex, relatable villain.
-  Acting and Character: It's as good as any drama out there. Robert Downey Jr seriously turns in a wonderful, nuanced performance. The character clashes are completely believable. Black Widow's choices sound odd on paper but they just make sense for who she is.
-  Fights and Character: The Russos do such a wonderful job telling a story through action. Every character has a unique fighting style. Each fight tells you something about them and their relationships. I love that Cap handles each combatant differently. He's always thinking strategically. Just watch how he handles Spidey, who technically should outgun him.
-  Black Panther: I cared more for Black Panther and his father than I did Superman and the Kents in the recent DC films. And they had two movies while these guys had just minutes of screen time in a packed film. (No hating on DC though. Wonder Woman was amazing and their animated universe is just awesome)",1498089600,,1541,4.696296296296296

The product is as advertised (that sometimes still is an issue even here on the amazing Amazon, but not for this one).  Definitely get this movie on Blu-ray.  The movie quality is better according to my husband (I am apparently blind to such things), and Blu-ray menus are always more useful according to me.

7705280,5,B01D9EUNB4,"The Captain America movies just keep getting better with each release. I thought ""The First Avenger"" was a lot of fun if not a little lacking in character development, thought ""The Winter Soldier"" was really great and helped flesh out Cap as a person and not just a costume, and now with ""Civil War"" I'm not sure where the series could go next. Whereas some reviews seem to fault the movie for the ""over-stuffed"" roster, I feel like it actually makes sense to have as many of the characters that do show up in the movie. Unless the story takes place on a different world, a la Thor, I've never really been able to accept why only some of the planet's superheroes would show up to battle whatever threat was facing the world on a given day.

What it really boils down to is the amount of enjoyment I get from watching the movie, and Civil War does not leave me wanting at all. The action sequences are some of the most amazing I've seen in recent movies, and certainly among other superhero movies from other studios, while at the same time the quiet moments provide the downtime needed between setpieces. The plot, while a little contrived (I wish there had been a more compelling villain) will keep you interested, and is more than just a vehicle for the action sequences. The performances from all the regular cast members are among the best you'll see in a superhero movie (Paul Rudd is always a standout, even in the smaller role as Ant-man), but the real standout is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. I was not familiar with the character before, but I am very excited for his solo movie after seeing him in this.",1496707200,5,1619,4.506802721088436

7705313,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America's Civil War is a blast of a Marvel movie, though like many recent Marvel offerings it is dragged down a bit by the Marvel formula. After the events of Captain America:  The Winter Soldier the world is hunting Bucky Barnes (the Winter Soldier). With the added problems of the devastation caused during Avengers:  Age of Ultron and collateral damaged that occurs in the opening of this film, the world governments come together to demand a new level of oversight over the Avengers. Iron Man wants to acquiesce to these demands due to his part in creating Ultron; Captain America wants to refuse as he feels government organizations are too easily corrupted after learning Hydra had been infiltrating SHIELD for years. Honestly, this movie is really Avengers 2.5 rather than a Captain America sequel. It does do a great job of continuing Steve Rogers' story and tying things together nicely around his friendship with Bucky, but enough of the other characters get their own arcs that it feels like a group movie.

There are also solid introductions to both Spider-Man and Black Panther (though the former's inclusion is a bit questionable since Tony Stark drafts him into the growing superhero war). The movie's much hyped airport fight scene between the two ""sides"" of this conflict is bombastic and awesome. The main drawback is just that the movie does pull a few punches and there are no fatalities like in the original comic. The stakes thus don't feel high enough. The climax of the movie is more personal and emotional which is a nice change from other Marvel movies going over the top with the ""world ending"" action. The real downside though is the villain. Daniel Bruhl is solid and intriguing as Helmut Zemo, but his ""plan"" in the movie relies on way too many conveniences and coincidences to make sense. If you can turn your brain off for the movie, you won't really care, but the moment you start to think about how Zemo had to perfectly predict the reactions and motivations of numerous characters it breaks the immersion of the film. Honestly, you just could drop Zemo entirely and the film would have worked well enough without him.",1494288000,11,2160,4.832432432432433

7705328,1,B01D9EUNB4,"The worst Captain America ever. By the way, I'm a big comic book fan too. Captain America's character was way overshadowed by Iron Man, Black Widow, and everyone not named Captain America. Not sure what everyone rating this 5-stars was watching. It's essentially two and a half hours of gratuitous action scenes, some awkward Captain and Romanoff scenes, and romance plots interwoven with I have no freaking idea. I don't care about the violence or language - I'm an adult and wouldn't let my kid watch this for obvious reasons (the violence and it sucks). Honestly, it's a smack in the face to comic fans everywhere. Can't decide which movie's worse, Civil War or Suicide Squad. I'm done with Captain America movies! Winter Soldier was horrible and this one makes it look Oscar-worthy.

Redeeming qualities: Martin Freeman's American accent, Ant Man (funny), the new Spider Man (hilarious), Black Panther (awesome) and Stan Lee's line at the end of the movie (also funny). That's all.",1492646400,2,985,5.0060975609756095

7705336,4,B01D9EUNB4,"While I'm not a die-hard Marvel fan, I have been enjoying the Marvel cinematic universe up to this point.  It's been fascinating seeing all these movies and stories tying together, and watching this new take on the classic backstories to some of the most famous characters in the comics world.  Of late, however, I feel that the Marvel films are starting to become too big and cumbersome, juggling way too many plotlines for their own good and proving to be a challenging prospect for audiences to keep up on.  This is especially galling if you happen to miss a few -- you end up missing chunks of plot that prove vital to understanding future films, and that can be obnoxious.

""Captain America: Civil War"" feels less like a ""Captain America"" film and more like a third ""Avengers"" film, and much like ""Age of Ultron"" it suffers the flaw of trying to juggle too many plotlines and characters in one film.  But it's still a riveting and even gut-wrenching film that adds a hefty dose of real-world consequences to the superhero world, and gives us one of the most heartbreaking conflicts in the Marvel universe.

""Captain America: Civil War"" follows the aftermath of a battle in which the Avengers emerge triumphant... but at the cost of innocent human lives.  In response, the governments of the world decide the Avengers must operate under government control, effectively putting a check on their powers and their abilities to respond to crises in a timely manner.  This divides the Avengers into two camps, one for this new government treaty and one against it... and it pits longtime friends Steve Rogers and Tony Stark against each other, as Steve/Captain America is against this new measure and Tony/Ironman is for it.  The situation becomes much more complicated as the king of an African nation is assassinated... and Steve's friend Bucky, also known as the Winter Soldier, is deemed responsible.  Soon loyalties are tested to their limits as Steve struggles to protect Bucky and find the assassin, as the Avengers are divided asunder and fight amongst themselves... and as a secret is brought to life that could shatter Steve and Tony's friendship forever.

As always, the special effects in this film are phenomenal.  Watching an Avengers movie is always a visual feast, with amazing and exciting fight scenes, fantastic powers and gadgets, and a smooth blending of CGI and live-action that always looks great.  The CGI is a bit obvious at times, but the film almost always stays exciting and engaging enough that it's never distracting for the audience.

Much like its predecessor, ""Age of Ultron,"" ""Civil War"" DOES try to cram too many characters and plots into one film.  There are just way too many Avengers to give each of them their own subplot, and while some of the characters are kept out of the film entirely (Thor and the Hulk), the film makes up for it by incorporating new characters (Ant-Man, Spiderman, and Black Panther).  The one benefit this film has over ""Age of Ultron"" is that all the subplots at least follow a common thread instead of meandering off in different directions -- the strained relationship between Black Widow and Hawkeye, Tony still bitter over the deaths of his parents, the burgeoning romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch, and the Black Panther out to avenge his father's death all contribute to the main plot, instead of being a distraction or a setup for a future film like many of the subplots in ""Age of Ultron"" felt like.  Still, it can make this film a bit of a chore to watch, especially if you happened to miss a movie or two.  (I myself haven't gotten around to watching ""Ant-Man"" yet, so that hero's cameo came out of the blue for me...)

The most powerful aspect of this film is the dynamic between the Captain and Ironman... and how the events of this film threaten to break it.  Watching their interactions throughout the film, their arguments and fights and the conflict over the treaty, is gutwrenching yet powerful, and I felt it added new dimensions to both characters.  And the film clearly shows that there are no easy answers to the problems it raises, and that both characters are in the right AND in the wrong on certain aspects.  The film could have easily painted one or the other as a villain, but thankfully it mostly avoids that.

And yes, this film ruthlessly teases the new Spiderman movie.  At least we'll go into it knowing it won't be yet another rehash of Spiderman's origin story... seriously, we've covered it already in two films AND a musical, we don't need to see it again...

While it doesn't focus as much on Captain America as the title will have you believe, this is a powerful entry in the Avengers franchise, and while a bit busy plotwise, it's still vital viewing for the Marvel cinematic universe fan.  And it has some unexpected emotional depth for being a ""comic-book movie,"" making it far more than just superheroes punching each other.  An excellent, if not perfect, entry in the Marvel franchise.",1492387200,,4999,4.7892898719441215

7705392,1,B01D9EUNB4,"They took God's name in vain. God's last name is not damn. That is deeply disrespectful. This is a typical feminist movie which bash men for no reason. Typical feminists love to bring up gender card for no reasons. For instance, Aunt Peggy's niece brought up a gender card. A character in a feminist tv show stated, ""Don't have kids especially not a daughter."" He was saying that they threatened his children's lives. That was deeply insulting to men and sons. A woman's life is never more important than a man. Both of their lives are equally important. Galatians 3:28 says, ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."" By the way, human's life is always more important than an animal. Many pure evil animals kill innocent humans for no reason. Even God said that we are more worth than birds. I agree with animal testings to save human's lives. A product namely Manic Panic tested on humans and that is deeply cruelty. Animal is not human. Also, in the typical feminist tv show, the man thinks that his dead sister was innocent and another man's dead son is not innocent. Seriously?!

You cannot believe anything you read or hear. Again, feminists love to insult men for no reasons. They love to blame men for everything and not owning up to their actions. It is the female soldier or civilian's fault for taking nude picture of themselves. I don't even take a nude photo of myself. My future husband is the only man that will see me naked. Where are the news that some women took pictures of men's naked body without their consent? It goes both ways! I read about the news about some female soldiers outside USA took pictures of themselves naked and shared it with the world. Again, feminist social media/news love to bash men for no reasons when they do the same thing. Of course typical feminist namely Jackie Speier stated that these women have volunteered to risk their lives for our country. I said, ""So do men!!!!!!"" Feminists always act like they are innocent and do nothing wrong and always point their fingers at men when it was them who shared with the world of their nude photos. Every time I type into, ""DMV,"" on Instagram, the women showed their nude photos even though I was looking for the DMV. I am like what DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has to do with nude photos. They could be either military or civilian. Both some women and men took pictures of each other without permission. You cannot say it is men only. Of course typical feminists said, ""Boys will be boys."" That is a false statement and wicked lie. How would they like it if I say, ""Whoremongers will be whoremongers."" Another feminist tv show made fun of little boys crying. A feminist mother said, ""Look at my little girl beating little boys in soccer and making them cry."" Seriously?! What a bad mother! I agree with God that man is head of the house and that woman is to be submissive and to be modest. If a woman had been modest in first place, then their pictures would not have showed up on Internet. Women should cover up while breastfeeding to be respectful of others. God told people to cover their nakedness while going up to altar, likewise cover up while breastfeeding. I shopped at Walmart on International Women Day, and it was one of the best days I ever did that and I love it. I agree with a man that tv shows are feminist. I had enough of male-bashings by feminists.",1489190400,4,3455,4.528

I am very thankful that Spider-Man made his intro into this movie and will be with the ""team"" in future movies. I was very pleased also with the introduction of Black Panther. Well done! Character balancing was a good thing here. Since THOR and HULK are off doing their own things, it made sense to keep them apart from this movie. Their powers alone would have brought about an unbalanced effect to the story.
Am looking forward to the future ""Infinity Wars"" movies coming. Should be fabulous! With Spider-Man making his own movie debut on 7-7-17, (Iron Man making an appearance), it will get us all ready for THOR 3 in November and then INFINITY WARS for 2018! Can't wait!

7705412,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Ive long believed that Captain America has provided some of the very best movies to emerge from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and that trend continues with Captain America: Civil War.

Based on a series than ran in the comic books a decade or so ago, Civil War features Cap and the rest of the Avengers (at least the characters that appear in this movie) being held to account by the governments of the world for the collateral damage they inflict while going about their business of defeating supervillians like Loki and evil organizations like Hydra. A compromise is worked out; the Avengers can stay in business if they agree to end their independence and submit to taking orders from a U.N. organization. Half the team, led by a slightly conscience-stricken Tony Stark, are amenable to the idea. The other half, led by a wary Captain America, want nothing to do with diplomats and politicians. Add in a bad-guy with an agenda of his own, and the result is an action-packed but also character-driven superhero movie that rises above the pack of this genre.

While clearly sympathetic to Caps point of view (the title is, after all, Captain America: Civil War) the filmmakers (and Robert Downey) do not allow the pro-control Avengers to turn into cardboard sell-outs.  They also do an exemplary job of choreographing the action and integrating characters into the storyline, including the Black Panther and a few surprises.  Virtually every major character has a good moment or scene or two, which isn't always the case with these multi-character movies, where it can seem the director is less of a storyteller than a traffic cop.

The films action set-piece, a show down between the two sides at a German airport where, old friendships aside, no punches are pulled, is extremely well done. Unlike some other directors who seem to set these sequences in darkest nights with rain pouring down, obscuring everything, like a van Gogh painted in a thunderstorm, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely shoot their epic fight in broad daylight. They pay attention to detail and excel at showing how, even in combat, the action is driven by the individual characters making individual decisions, instead of the typical guys-dressing-up-in-tin-cans-and-knocking-each-other-down fight scenes in comic book movies. The filmmakers also add several plot twists and turns, and at a few key moments upend expectations.

This DVD package includes very few features, which is fine with me, I hardly ever watch them.

Recommended for: Fans of really good comic book movies.",1488585600,26,2559,5.078571428571428

I streamed this online and the best I can say about this waste of time is that at least I didn't also waste any money on it.

7705417,5,B01D9EUNB4,"The most perfect superhero movie made to date. It not only balanced its huge cast but gave every character a satisfying arc, with the main characters hitting some surprisingly moving, honest-feeling emotional highs that I would not have expected in a superhero film. It also introduced the MCU's first African leading man superhero, Black Panther, in an absolutely glorious way--can't wait for his standalone film as a result of this fantastic intro the Russo Brothers' gave him in this film, and Chadwick Boseman's arresting performance.

As for Cap and Bucky--even admist all the thrilling action set pieces and death-defying stunts, we get a deftly understated emotional arc and very satisfying resolution to their tragic story. Civil War is a beautifully bittersweet end to the Steve Rogers Captain America trilogy overall as well, that manages to have plenty of fun, spectacle, and ""feels"" in the process. Highly recommended!",1488326400,16,930,5.326530612244898

You do a great job playing Cap, and you almost make him worth watching.  Unfortunately for your character the writers have an unhealthy Cap obsession and won't let him actually be a human.  Hell Vision and Ultron are more human than Cap in the MCU and they're fancy robots.

The movie isn't bad, but it wasted so much build up and potential that I can't seem to stop hating it for what it failed to be.",1487289600,,511,4.462365591397849

7705452,4,B01D9EUNB4,"I liked this movie quite a bit.  Marvel has had quite a few excellent movies, the previous Captain America being one of the best.  I do have one question though?  Why was this called a Captain America movie rather than an Avengers movie.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  The other Captain America movies were primarily about him, and this one was about the Avengers throughout.
This is the weakest of the Captain America series, though.  I found it unbelievable that the members of the Avengers would draw off against each other with so little dialogue or discussion.  There was no attempt really to try to understand each other's point of view.  They behaved rather like children at times.  I couldn't buy that part of the story.
Still, it was worth watching.  Then go back and watch the previous one.",1487289600,,801,4.697841726618705

Also to all the people who say Cap beat Ironman, all I can say is lol. He basically kicked cap and bucky's arse at the same time. No one ever seems to feel the effects of fighting though, except maybe the very end scene where cap could barely stand.

Who looks at reviews for a Blu-Ray of a movie that they already aren't  planning on buying anyway? In any event: Do the thing, buy this movie. This level of action deserves to be in viewed in the maximum that high definition can offer you. There are super heroes, fast paced combat scenes, and 'spolsions!

The extras are a blast if you're super into the nitty gritty behind the scenes production details that you get from audio commentary and features. In the event that you're really here because you're not at all familiar with Civil War as a movie I will say one thing. This film is very loosely based on the comic books. If you're expecting a direct adaptation you're not going to find it, and that isn't a bad thing. The characters in this film have different motivations than that of the characters in the comic of the same name, but the story is solid.

The plots are corny and weak, but they are so much better than the never ending dramas that my wife prefers.  Well, viva the difference.  We both like some movies, like series on the big cable movie networks that bring forward their own creations.  This is one of the less entertaining of the comic book movies.  Three stars.",1485475200,,467,4.5
7705555,1,B01D9EUNB4,"It was fun to watch but it's no where near as good as the first two.

For some reason they went cheap on this one.  You can even tell there's nothing in the coffee cups when they're in a stake-out.  It's so corny including the dialog.  Who wrote this?  1st graders?

And it's not really a Captain America flick.  It should have been called Avengers 3.  If it's called Captain America why are all the other heroes present?  They only get together when they're the Avengers.  Again, 1st graders.

A real Captain America movie would have concentrated on Captain America and his trusty side-kick The Falcon.  But they failed to do that.  Again they went real cheap.  It should never have been called Captain America Civil War.  The real title is Avengers: Civil War.

But the worst thing about this movie is there is no real villain.  Just some blow-joe who lost some family members when the Avengers saved the world.  But of course the guy and that dumb woman who lost a son in the same incident don't understand that during wars against evil there's collateral damage and that in every war civilians die.  Neither do the 1st grade writers who wrote this lousy script turning Iron Man into a wimp who's knees get wobbly every time he hears a sob story.

So many villains to choose from and they load a blank.  Another name for this film could have been Captain America and the Cry Babies.

Another thing to note is they ruined Spider-Man's secret Identity.  In the comics, the great thing about Spider-Man was that nobody knew who he was -- nobody except the readers and that's what made that character great.  And those that did never lived long enough to tell.  But eventually Marvel screwed that up too.

Iron-Man never knew who Spider-Man was until these 1st graders gave it up just so Parker could take advantage of Stark's gadgets.  So far Marvel, Sony, Disney, & Stan Lee are doing a tremendous job destroying every character ever created in Marvel Comics  -- a bunch of morons running through the white kitchen floor with muddy shoes chasing the greenback.

In fact I recommend that people just watch the movies and skip reading the comics books, because the films will never match the comic books -- never.  In other words, what you read is not what you get.

I can tell you for a fact that I wasted my time reading Marvel Comic books.  Forget the comics.  Just watch the movies.  Otherwise you'll learn how moronic these people are.",1485475200,,2439,4.582366589327147

7705557,2,B01D9EUNB4,"Didn't like all the time they spent arguing whether to submit to an oversight committee.  It was pretty silly with them fighting over which side to take... especially when they starting fighting to the death.  I do like action movies, but there needs to be a believable plot that is not a boring political statement that gets pounded into you for over 2 hours.  If you can ignore all the political drama and the fact that they're fighting to the death over something pretty dumb, then maybe you'd be able to appreciate all the action.",1485475200,,534,4.6

I'm not saying I expect a quip every two minutes but c'mon, guys, would it kill you to have a light moment here and there so we can at least breathe?

This took place after the events from ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" & ""Ant-Man"". The story of this movie is about the government want the Avengers to work for them and it causes a deep catastrophic wedge between Captain America (played by Chis Evans) & Iron Man (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) that turns them into bitter enemies. This movie also introduced the Black Panther (played by ""42"" star Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (played by Tom Holland) to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

7705635,5,B01D9EUNB4,"I have heard great things about this movie and I thought that I was going to cry given how the Avengers are dividing over the issue of government oversight. I haven't picked a team and I don't think I will. I'm a mix, I guess.

Anyway, back to the movie. Wow. Woo-hoo! This movie is a wild ride of action, effects and story. I haven't read any of the comics, but I have been following most Marvel movies, and this one did not disappoint in the least. Even though the story is more mature and brooding, there is also plenty of humorous moments, especially in Tom Holland's Spiderman.

People, those fans were not kidding. This Spider Man flat out steals every scene that he's in with his humor, agility, nerdy persona and Tom Holland is the perfect choice to harbor Marvel's youngest superhero. He even looks a little like Toby Maguire. He was undoubtedly the best part of the movie, even though he didn't get much screen time. Totally looking forward to the new Spiderman movie due next year.

Another huge highlight is the jealousy between Bucky and Falcon. Maybe jealousy isn't the right word, but these two do not exactly get along. Their moments together, though brief in number, are awfully hilarious as well.

Wondering what's going to happen in the next movies to come.",1484179200,11,1276,4.632743362831858
7705636,4,B01D9EUNB4,I don't like the Captain America movies as much as the Ironman and Avengers movies but this one was pretty good and had a good plot and story.,1484179200,,142,4.107142857142857
7705637,3,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America Civil War is another Marvel Avengers film basically.  These movies are starting to become repetitive like the live action transformers movies just with better acting.  The action is a lot like A-team stuff 1000 shots fired and no blood anywhere, broken bones or real consequences for all the damage the Avengers do.  I get sick and tired of watching goodie to shoes Captain America trying to save Mr. Bucky.  The way the studio is leaving all these Marvel films open ended is getting kind of annoying as well.  Why not come to a concrete conclusion to end the movie instead of just ongoing with no real finish.

The movie isn't bad but it seems overly long with too many characters all trying to fill in their own story points at the same time.  The funny thing is all the Captain America rebellious heros in this film should be the other way around all for the accords and regulations whereas Iron Man and his team I see as the rebellious personalities.  Case in point is Spider Man and Iron Man themselves they just kind of make the rules up as they go both smart a**es and don't conform to other peoples rules.

Spoiler alert

I highly doubt if Iron Man was that enraged, that he would not totally take out Captain America first disabling him and then kill Bucky I find it hard to believe Tony Stark would be that careless.  I mean if someone knew who killed your parents and didn't tell you who the killer was wouldnt that kind of damage your relationship when you found out.  Oh but a personal letter makes it all better and everything is forgiven.  I would have given this film a higher rating if Iron Man actually got to kill Bucky but nope cant come to a solid conclusion.

These movies are starting to be just like the X-men films good action scenes but far too much action where they take precedence over the story itself.  Thats just  my take on it, I am sure all the fan boys will thrash this review anyway.  I would give this film 3  stars it does have some funny moments and good times but goes off in too many different directions.  Price should be similar to your stander DVD no more than $14 it's definitely not worth $20.",1484179200,,2155,4.4238578680203045

The best actors and characters often hung out on screen in the background while seemingly attempting to develop less interesting characters in the foreground, which failed miserably... there was no single likeable character or ""hero"" to pull the film along, and characters which were likeable and pulled their own films along before, became unlikable and embarrassing.  Finally, at the end of the film, tossing in a mish-mosh of other characters (and tossing them at each-other in random conflicts) in a seemingly last ditch effort to make someone or something interesting emerge from the film... but managing only to bring in a few final moments of comic relief with iron-man / spider-man in an otherwise depressingly awful Marvel Mashup.",1483574400,,984,5.182389937106918

I did, however, enjoy Mark Millar's comic story of Civil War, and I enjoy the Marvel series that are currently being run on Netflix, so I was excited to see this film.

Honestly, meh. It was okay - entertaining enough, but lacking the depth and gravitas of the source material (but what else is new with comic movies?). I do not understand the raving fanatical reviews of this film. Too many cameos, and to be frank, Spiderbrat was irritating. Similarly, as much as I like Paul Rudd, Antman and his humor seemed out of place.

If you want to watch heavily choreographed fight scenes that seem to go on forever, then by all means, this movie is for you.

The choreography was outstanding and the cinematography was dynamic without being confusing or inducing motion sickness.  Everyone talks about the airport fight scene, which deserves the praise but the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier and Iron Man is very visceral and exciting.  The story was comic book nonsense which isn't meant as an insult, I just mean that there is a certain point where you have to just accept it for what it is.  It was cohesive enough for what it was.  I am a little disappointed that this story wasn't more of a stand alone movie and I'm not sure someone coming in new would enjoy it as much as those that have seen the Avengers' films and the other Captain America movies.  When I first saw the previews I was worried that it looked a little dark and serious but there's just the right amount of humor.  There are also quite a few places where the action gives way to story development such as a funeral (no spoilers) and after the initial opening fight scene.

Bucky could argue his innocence through brainwashing in court, but why would Cap or anybody want someone like that (even a friend) roaming free even if he was framed for the Geneva bombing? Why would Scott Lang/Ant-Man be involved in an illegal operation when he was trying to stay on the straight and narrow during the Ant-Man movie?

I have loved the performances that they have all given and think that the friendships they have made in the previous movies really has set this movie up for how great is was received. Cap is doing his best to be the good guy and at the same time a good friend, though in his usual self righteous way. Tony on the other hand is feeling bad for a lot of the collateral damage that has gone on because of or around many of his creations. It is interesting to see how different characters pick different sides and what their motivations are for it.
I hope that Marvel keeps up the good work and gives us movies about comic hero's that keep up the good works they have been doing in the past many years.",1482969600,2,748,4.2377622377622375

Civil War was on my radar for a long time, and I was eagerly awaiting seeing it.  It didn't dissapoint in the least.  The conflict between the various super heros was well played out on the big screen.  The surprise addition of the new Spider-Man and Giant Man were wonderful.  Black Panther was fantastic as an unwavering dynamic machine.  The subtle, unobtrusive political overtones about the power of the government over the individual was well done, and I couldn't wait to own the home version of this non-stop action fest.
Will it sweep the Oscars? No. Not likely. Those movies are snoozefests.  Will it keep you entertained for a few hours? Big old yep.  One of the best, IMHO, comic movies to date, with plenty of action, humor, and excitement.",1482883200,3,873,4.587096774193548

As recent Marvel spectacles go, this is probably the most entertaining and least ponderous, though after the umpteenth fight scene-serious dialogue-fight scene-more serious dialogue sequence I personally was ready for it to end long before it did.

7706114,4,B01D9EUNB4,I wasn't going to rent this because I did not like Age of Ultron.  I gave Civil War a chance and was surprised that it was good.  The story was much better than expected and I enjoyed the introduction of new characters to the Marvel film universe.  This movie made me want to see the upcoming Spider-Man and Black Panther movies.  The only knock on this movie was the villain.  I wish that Marvel would stick to the comics and create a villain that we know.  Baron Zemo's look and backstory are created for this movie.  He has no affiliation to Hydra or the Red Skull.

7706161,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Yes, the Avengers are back and this super long film is populated with one of the most impressive list of actors in the business. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have transformed the Marvel comics writers Joe Simon and Jack Kirby ideas and concepts and Mark Millars comic book Civil War into one explosive and at times very funny adventure. Anthony and Joe Russo hold it all together as directors.

Whether you are a Marvel comics devotee or just a person who likes to see a group of good and good-looking actors/actresses do a lot of impossibly ridiculous feats, this film is entertainment. No profound messages (except the goal of the Avengers is to make the world safe and right wrongs that threaten life on this planet) but the endless CGI tricks and costumes and jabbing dialogue are enough to make you stick around for the 2  hours of off the wall antics.

A synopsis is hardly feasible with so much action: With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America (Chris Evans) feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man - Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Team Captain America - Captain America (Chris Evans), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant Man (Paul Rudd)) while a new villain Zemo (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) emerges.

Add to this a dazzling cast actors with bit parts  Frank Grillo, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Kani, Hope Davis, Howard Stark, and Alfre Woodward  and it is easy to see why actors as well as audiences have fun with the Avengers characters. Take it for what it is  CGI wizardry embellished with some terrific puns and patter. It IS a comic book, afterall! Grady Harp, December 16",1482192000,,2305,4.940568475452197

7706200,1,B01D9EUNB4,"The whole premise of the movie is faulty.

1. Maybe because I didn't watch the whole franchise but in this movie a random nobody(Helmut) had all of this power and technology to start this Civil War was a major story breaking  leap.  (Compared to BatmanVsSuperman where the villain was a billionaire and had lots of power.)

2. Captain America is full of himself.  He knows the Winter Solider is a danger yet wants this guy to be free?  He knows this guy murdered Stark's parents but gives Winter Solider a pass?  That doesn't make any sense.  While he is hunting down all these other people praying on humanity..  Random brother hood = free pass on murder? What? Huh?

3. You have all these people blindly following Captain America.  Not really giving their own personal reasons just following.

4. Black Widow. Huh? It breaks the premise of loyalty for both sides.

Finally, after all of this how can anyone be on Captain America's side? All the other criminals get punished and thrashed by Captain America but not this Winter Solider who is proven time and time again dangerous. For loyalty?  The thing that Black Widow broken the premise of already in the movie?",1481932800,2,1165,4.702970297029703

Well I went to see CA:CW in theaters with friends... who are fans of Marvel... and it was a game changer. This movie was AWESOME! I loved it so much that I went home and over the next 2 weeks re-watched every MCU movie, including the ones I hadn't seen yet and now I LOVE the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Civil War is probably tied for my favorite of the Marvel movies.

Captain America fulfills his role as the unwavering hero that we expect him to be even in the face of the things that would deter anyone else.
The movie involves a few too many politics for my taste.  Not real world politics but applicable marvel universe superhero related politics that are not uncommon in Marvel comics..
Tony Stark plays the jerk for the majority of the film.
The action is great and there is a deeper underlying plot to the whole movie so it gets four stars.

Great platform to introduce some new characters and more incorporate others into the mainstream MCU.  The introduction of Spider Man seemed a little forced in my opinion but it was still good and did not take away from the movie in the slightest.  Marvel Studios continues to top themselves with this production.  They continue to get better as the story line progresses.

The jokes can feel a little bit forced and corny at times, but the action is what steals the shows, and it outshines the sometimes ""convoluted"" story, considering that it involves connecting lots of characters, in a determined amount of time.

Throwing the nitpicking aside, a great movie.

It is December 16, 1991. Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), is released from his Russian chamber. They have a mission for him. Riding on a motorcycle, with his super strength, he is able to move a car on the road and it crashes. Bucky retrieves the serum from the back of the trunk.
  Now in the present day, in Lagos, Captain America (Chris Evans), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are fighting Crossbones (Frank Grillo) to get into the building to retrieve the bio weapon.
  Later, Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) is not pleased with the Avengers team leaving destruction in the cities of New York, Washington DC, Sokovia and Lagos. They have also killed innocent people in the process. They have operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That is now going to change. They will no longer be a private organization. Under the Sokovia Accords, signed by 117 countries, they will now operate under the United Nations panel, when deemed necessary. This will cause superhero to fight against superhero.

Also in the cast: Chadwick Boseman, Alfre Woodard, Emily Van Camp, Tom Holland, Daniel Bruhl, Martin Freeman, John Kani, Marisa Tomei.

An extra scene appears during the end credits and a second scene after end credits.

Filmed at the Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.  Berlin, Germany.  Leipzig/Halle Airport, Saxony, Germany. Iceland. Brazil.

...Unlike, for example, the X-Men franchise, which --despite being my favorite series of comics growing up, and having perhaps the richest set of themes to draw from-- continues to crank out uninspiring installments.

I'll probably watch it again, end-to-end. It's just good.",1480723200,8,535,5.357142857142857
7706616,3,B01D9EUNB4,"The First Avenger and Winter Soldier are my favorite MCU movies by far, so I had high hopes for Civil War. Unfortunately, as a Capt movie, this leaves a lot to be desired. It feels more like Avengers 2.5 than a movie focused on Steve Rogers and unfortunately even the Russo brothers can't handle so huge a cast as adeptly as the characters deserve. Little slips in logic make the movie lose a lot of it's punch, too. (Seriously - Tony's guilt over a young man's death leads him to force an even younger man - boy, really - into battle? WTF, Tony? And why did no one bring up what the death toll would have been if the Avengers *hadn't* stopped the Chitauri's invasion?)

At least they did Natasha far more justice than in Rise of Ultron. (Seriously, Nat deserves so much better than what she got in that movie.) And unlike a lot of other disappointed fans, I don't mind the focus Tony got. I just wish they'd left the ""Civil War"" part out and focused instead on the personal conflict between Steve, Tony, and Bucky - there's plenty of great story and characterization to explore there, without needing to expand the cast to include every MCU character aside from GotG.

Overall, it's not bad and could have been a lot worse in less talented hands. On the other hand, if you're looking for a Steve-centric story with the same punch and beautiful style as TFA or WS, regrettably you won't find it here.",1480723200,,1400,4.46484375

7706697,4,B01D9EUNB4,"As one who does not define himself as a comic book fanatic I still read my share as a kid but read them too fast to make steady consumption worth my small allowance.  Back in the 60's we had some poorly animated (especially by today's standards) but no less entertaining cartoons of the Marvel superheroes including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Spiderman, and The Hulk which is where I built my foundation with these characters.  So, being able to see these visually dazzling modern films with live actors is always a treat even when sometimes the stories may not be that great.

""Captain America: Civil War"" is a 4.5 star extravaganza and in my opinion a better film than the muddled ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".  There's a ton of stuff going on here and I know that it'll take watching more than once to take it all in.  The premise that these ""enhanced"" heroes have to be held accountable for the collateral damage they inflict while saving the world makes surprisingly good sense.  Needless to say that not all of the gang are on board having to toe the line with bureaucratic restrictions, hence the civil war between our team mates.  Sides are drawn with Tony Stark showing uncharacteristic responsibility leading one group and Captain America and his sympathizers disagreeing with Stark and the new rules of engagement.  I won't go into any details but as mentioned above there are many moving parts to this story and plenty of side plots as well making things a bit hard to keep up with (maybe just showing my age?).  Personally I like my heroes to be sympatico and couldn't bring myself to watch the earlier released DC ""Batman vs. Superman"" because the thought of these two greats as antagonists just made me sad.  This Blu-ray sat on my shelf for the same reason for several weeks before I could bring myself to watch it and it was worth the wait.

The film has the typical humorous bits you'd expect from a Marvel production, especially amusing is the new Spiderman and Ant Man ads some comic relief to the mix.  We don't get to see the Hulk or Thor in this outing but that's OK as there are just so many players that it's almost overwhelming.  The visuals are impressive and the climactic fight scene between Iron Man and Cap' is pretty epic.  If you're a fan of this genre then CA: Civil War is a must to add to your collection.  ""Nuff said"".

7706744,5,B01D9EUNB4,"This was marketed as a Captain America film. It was really an Avengers 2.5 film. Awesome acting, great action sequences, and a lot of depth and humour from a cast that really likes the mythos that they are based on. Did Batman Versus Superman disappoint you? Give this film a try, and you will see how hero fights hero, without saying ""MARTHA!"".",1479600000,,345,4.580645161290323
7706745,3,B01D9EUNB4,"Ever get the feeling something has just become too big and because of that, has lost some of its enjoyment?

I felt like that with this film!

Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed it. It didn't feel like the third Captain America though, more like another Avengers film with a few extra characters thrown into the mix! Apart from Banner and Thor, everyone else was involved  plus a few extra.

It wasn't just the number of characters. The film could have been cut in length  odd scenes taken out or trimmed down  and it wouldnt lose any of the storyline. In fact, the tension might have increased if it didn't take so long to get to the action. I honestly got bored for about an hour of this film!

So saying, when the action got going, it was intense. All of the Avengers facing off against one another shows how big these films have got  they have the budget and special effects to do anything they want these days.

The major fight (Captain America v Iron Man) was more violent than we have previously seen in the Marvel films. The fight was personal  so the tension increased, the mood and lighting were done to match and the whole scene kept you on tenderhooks as to who was going to emerge triumphant.

Character development also appeared to be missing, especially for such a long film. Admittedly, we got to see more of Bucky and understand his character compared to his first appearance in The Winter Soldier.

But Steve stuck to his guns (or, you know, shield!) and refused to give up his ideals. While this makes him the hero we know and love, it also showed he couldn't compromise or listen as a follower, only as a leader. And that side of Steve is the side we have seen from the beginning!

Its fair to say this film disappointed me. I have been a fan of the Marvel films since they started, but now I feel their popularity is working against them. The budgets mean they can make it as long and explosive as they like. Rather than cutting out implausible ideas, they are all left in. Bigger doesnt mean better!

I enjoyed the concept, but really wish it had been shorter!",1479600000,,2076,4.414698162729659
7706746,2,B01D9EUNB4,This is typical Marvel mush. Check your brain at the door and don't look back. CGI is worse than most.,1479600000,,102,4.15

I also enjoyed the insertion of the newer ""non-Avenger"" characters such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ant-Man/dp/B015YJPVQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ant-Man</a>&nbsp;and Falcon, both introduced in the Ant-Man movie..

7706753,4,B01D9EUNB4,Great Movie.  Best in the series.  I would not recommend buying the Digital version version.

What a mistake, made me no longer like him as a character. I can go on and on but I won't. Critics need to get off of Marvels jock and see the problem with this movie, it was good but not great.

7706835,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Solid effort from Marvel.. Not quite as good as Winter Soldier but better then Age of Ultron, Iron Man 2 and 3, plus any of the Thor movies. When the Heros turn on themselves it is a much better premise then some of the weak Villains of late in the other Marvel Universe flicks.  This movie also speaks to the conflict of individualism vs collectivism where in this example no side is completely right or wrong.  The plot also allows for some humor at the right times which helps move a long movie along to the final third act.

All around nicely done. Gives me hope that the upcoming Russo directed Avengers movies will finally have a plot and villain/rival worthy of the first one.",1479168000,2,683,4.448

7706844,3,B01D9EUNB4,"Good movie with interesting premise. If you're familiar with the Marvel Avengers series this is a good continuation to the franchise - if you're not familiar with the preceding episodes it will be a bit confusing. It does not stand alone, which is why I only rated it 3 stars. It has some interesting cameos and does a nice job of setting up for the next episode in the series. Not a classic - and nowhere near the quality of ""Iron Man 3"" which is my all-time favorite of this group - but worth a watch if you're a fan of Marvel.",1479168000,,529,4.196078431372549

It is violent, but action packed!

But if you are an Avengers fan, you like superheroes, etc. - really take a pass .  You will waste 2.5 hours that you can't recover.
Marvel's anti-hero Elitist crowd that thinks it is ""cool"" to destroy superheroes ... will accomplish one thing -- destroying this movie franchise.

Marvel won't sucker me into watching another Avengers movie after this.  The Ultron movie was a mess, but this was a disaster.

7706995,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Civil War breaks away from the tried and true and tired formulaic superhero plot, and it really shines because of it. There's no impressive and powerful villain, or imminent threat of annihilation. The main antagonist appears only sporadically and doesn't cast a long shadow. The real conflict is between the characters, none of which are entirely blameless, and none of which really end up winning. Of course, Marvel's usual trademarks of witty dialogue and big-budget action sequences are as present as always.

7707024,3,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War is more a sequel to the lackluster Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) than a Captain America movie. Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.) seems to have at least as much screen time as Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). They are joined by Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Wanda Maximoff (Elisabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), and newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spiderman (Tom Holland). The Avengers are receiving increasingly bad press in the wake of a bloody confrontation with some commandos trying to steal a biological agent in the fictional African nation of Wakanda. The US Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) announces his support for the Sokovia Accords, which would place the Avengers under the supervision of a United Nations panel. Mired in guilt, Stark and Romanoff support the initiative, while Steve Rogers is skeptical of institutional control.

As the title implies, the disagreement devolves into an Avenger Civil War. The Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is the issue that cleaves the Avengers into two warring factions, when he is accused of a terrorist act, and Rogers wants to protect him. Avenger is pitted against Avenger, each side trying to contain the other, without actually wanting to hurt each other. You can contemplate how much sense that makes. This is the second storyline, after Age of Ultron, whose villain is not so much a threat to humanity as a threat to the Avengers. The Avengers fight for their own right to wreak havoc rather than for anything heroic. These villains want to rid the world of the Avengers, because they're more trouble than they're worth. After two films of this, the audience may tend to agree. I don't know if its intended to be allegorical, or why, if so, two films would have the same theme. But the ideas don't come off any better here than in Ultron. Watching Avenger fight Avenger is not engaging. And they could have found a better Peter Parker in any high school in America.

Robert Downey, Jr. and Chris Evans are usually the most convincing Avengers. Luckily, they are the focus of the movie. Unluckily, the garrulous Tony Stark has lousy dialogue. Ironman and Captain America have inexplicably swapped value systems. Falcon has a new little remote called Red Wing that is a dull deus ex machina. Complaints about CGI in an action movie might seem out of place, and no one expects action sequences to look realistic, but things like ocean and clouds in this movie look so fake that its distracting. A $250 million production budget should buy better fakery than that. It makes no dramatic sense to pit one team of Avengers against another in battles that we know they all must survive. Thematically, this is total flop. Scheming Sovokian Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a strong villain, but the movie is only marginally better than Age of Ultron. I wish that once Marvel would not overload its movies with characters but devote more development to the main half-dozen or so who matter to this narrative. And someone needs to rediscover script-writing.",1477958400,,3215,5.0756143667296785
7707025,4,B01D9EUNB4,"A bit long, but very exciting. The first movie; Captain American, The First Avenger is still my favorite of the series. That story had the most heart.

7707052,3,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War was...OK.

I would have like it better if they had fixed THREE things.  1: Stop shaking the camera!  The practical effect fights were slapped around like crazy.  The wide angle digi-fights were stable.  Do you know what ""consistency"" means?

2: Narrow your focus.  Apparently since Sony let Marvel play with Spider-Man again they decided to pay homage to Sony's ""Everything Including The Kitchen Sink"" approach to story telling.  We don't need two main plots plus four sub-plots, two new characters plus everyone else but the Hulk and Thor, and some goofy thru thread about Scarlet Witch and Vision that came out of absolutely no where, and TWO after credit stingers.  Narrow...the focus.

3: Understand your characters better.  Some of the ways these characters were motivated and used or underused shows a bit of a misread on these characters by the writers and the director.

The battles were cool, Spidey finally IS Spidey again after those awful ""Amazing"" movies, Marisa Tomei Aunt May is still a mistake and I don't care how many winks they have Stark give to the new direction, Black Panther MIGHT be cool when his movie comes up, but this movie was basically ""Sequel Bait!  The Movie!""

Spent so much time setting up a sequel and two stand alone character films that it  barely told a focused story of its own.  Not bad, but not nearly good enough to be the keystone film we've been building to.",1477872000,,1430,4.799180327868853

7707071,4,B01D9EUNB4,An other Marvel movie.  They are kind of going down hill.,1477785600,,57,4.181818181818182
7707072,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Here's the problem I have with this otherwise excellent flick: The idea that, somehow, the Avengers need to be reined in because they are responsible for some collateral damage while stopping aliens, a murderous AI creation, and some really bad humans from trying to destroy the Earth and its people is, well, kinda silly. The simple fact is this: We know, as a race that has been almost continually at war for 5,000-plus years, that in a conflict non-combatants die. It's absolutely regrettable but, as Captain America notes at one point in the movie, sometimes you can't save everyone so your only option is to save as many people as possible. How many thousands of men, women and children died, for example, in the bombing raids over Nazi Germany in World War II? That number will likely never be known but - and this is important - after the war we did not condemn the men who flew those missions nor did we condemn the men who ordered them. In addition, the fact those raids took place also - undoubtedly - saved millions of lives that would have been lost if the war had dragged on for two, three or even four more years.
The fact that a highly placed government official - a man who, according to the story, received the Medal of Honor for, perhaps, causing some collateral damage of his own during a time of war - is carrying that message to the Avengers is plausible to a point. The fact that he sympathizes with the politicians who want to control the Avengers is not. He, of all people, should have an understanding of what it means to fight an implacable enemy that is bent on your destruction. Instead, he comes off as a self-serving politician eager to curry favor with his masters.
That Tony Stark, who bears an enormous amount of residual guilt as a result of his career as an arms developer, might go along with the idea that the Avengers need to be monitored isn't implausible. Neither is the idea that Captain America would be foursquare against such meddling by self-serving politicians. What I found hard to accept, however, was how willing some of the other Avengers were to agree with the politicians, Black Widow, for example, has operated ""off the books"" for a long time and surely knows that having a politically motivated monitor looking over her shoulder would effectively mean the end to her usefulness. Col. Rhodes should have been, at least in my opinion as a former combat infantryman myself, equally uncomfortable with meddling by those who chose to stay home instead of putting on a uniform, swearing the oath, and fighting for their country at a time when it and its people were in danger of being destroyed..
Okay, enough ranting. That somewhat silly premise aside, this is a really good movie with strong character development and some truly spectacular fight scenes. (I mean, can anyone actually say they DON'T enjoy watching Black Widow fight? Her moves are awesome.)
I especially enjoyed the way Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans played their parts in this movie but that doesn't mean I think there were any weak links in the cast. I very much enjoyed them all and, unlike some reviewers, I really enjoyed the light touches provided by the Spider-Man and Ant-Man characters during that monumental fight at the airport.
The special effects and the cinematography were both up to - and in many cases exceeded - Marvel's consistently high standards making ""Civil War"" a great viewing experience.
I do foresee a problem in future movies, however. With the revelation that Bucky Barnes killed Tony Stark's parents, I am not certain how he and Captain America can ever reconcile. I look forward to seeing how - or should I perhaps say ""if"" - that conflict can be resolved.
The verdict: This is a 4.5 star movie.",1477785600,,3745,4.710365853658536

7707076,3,B01D9EUNB4,"I have to say that to me personally, I enjoyed the other two previous Avengers movies much better than Civil War. Mainly because I just didn't like the team to be split up like this. They worked better as a team in the other movies, despite little quirky differences and small disagreements in the character development, but not to the point going full head to head with each other. I got a little lost in the plot development and had to backtrack to understand what was being said to start this Civil War. Some confusing.",1477785600,,522,4.505263157894737
7707077,2,B01D9EUNB4,"Where do I even start?  There are way too many comic book characters...to the point they are spilling out of every corner of the screen.  About 127 of them (sarcasm) punch, kick, or otherwise attack each other with devastating blows which rarely harm or even momentarily stun each other.  The cinematography of shaky camera and fast edits even when there is no fight happening gives me a headache.  Worst of all, Tony Stark has been changed from a hip rebel to a smarmy 6th grade hall monitor and self appointed superhero cop to the united nations.  That's right, Iron Man instantly makes himself judge, jury, and executioner against all of the good guys only trying to keep the world a safer place.  The whole thing reeks of Anakin Skywalker going from taking down the evil empire one day to killing five year old jedi students the next.  The 1,000 punches in this movie should have only been 100.  The 10,000 camera cuts should have been 1,000.  Someday this will be obvious!",1477785600,,977,4.666666666666667

7707085,4,B01D9EUNB4,"As far as the movie itself - it's a good movie. Pretty much everyone understands what they're getting by now when it comes to the Captain America and Avengers movie franchises. I quite liked it. However, I'm not really into purchasing movies. The only reason I find to do so is if it has a different version that wasn't available in theaters, such as an extended or director's cut, and most especially for the audio commentary. I am a straight-up lover of movie commentary, so that's what I'm primarily basing my 4-star rating on.

As commentaries go, this one is good, but not great. I like hearing how the directors made some of their choices and how they view their role within the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. They had a few funny stories, but not too many, which I like. I don't watch these just to hear about what a fun and great time they had, which unfortunately is what some other movie commentaries seem to focus most on. The Russo brothers don't divulge any real secrets or spoilers, which is also just fine by me. I like to be surprised so I don't feel I need any more information than necessary to enjoy this movie or the ones that will follow.

I've certainly seen better commentaries, but theirs was not bad at all. I think for the type of movie this is, what they had to say was fitting. I didn't really care about the other extras on this Blu-ray. The deleted scenes and additional features are fine to watch once, but in my opinion they don't really add much to the overall experience.

So it's a solid movie with a good commentary. No more. No less. If you're into these movies as I am then I think you'll be satisfied.",1477699200,,1643,4.433774834437086

The motivations and differences between Captain America and Iron Man finally come to a head.  The plot does make you consider some of the ramifications glossed over in other superhero media as to collateral damage and how governments would look at such a freelance force.

The main reason I prefer Winter Soldier is due to its plot twist midway through the movie.  That kind of twist is not present here.

We had great internet connection and my tv is and HD tv so not sure about the problems.

But a fun movie to watch with my kids (older) and husband.",1477440000,,377,4.094594594594595

7707170,5,B01D9EUNB4,"OK this isn't really Captain America 3, it's more like Avengers 3 or Spider Man 6, it's another Marvel film that, like Marvel comics, assumes you already know who these folks are and will follow them through a half dozen other titles.

But, darn it, it does that really well.

The plot is both simple and unfathomably complex.  Bucky Barns, the Winter Soldier (see Captain America 1 and 2) is framed for a crime and the Avengers (see a dozen other films) are split between Captain America who wants to prove his innocence and Iron Man who wants to take him in.  And they fight.

Captain America is a guest star in his own film with Robert Downey's Iron Man and Tom Holland's Spider Man stealing the show.  But that's fine.  Because they do a really great job.  I'm an old cynical comic and movie fan and I was grinning like a kid and I'm ready to run out and see (yet another) Spider Man reboot.

Yeah the plot is nonsense, with holes you can drive a truck through.  Yeah it has a dozen or more superheroes and introduces some more for good measure.

But y'know what it's really good and really fun.  I think I'll watch it again tonight.",1477440000,2,1137,4.3619047619047615

If you've ever owned a big, goofy, stupid dog who's incessantly crazy-happy you exist that's Spiderman in this movie. They definitely needed to dial that back a bit. The Ant Man scenes on the other hand were awesome and hilarious. I hadn't seen Ant Man so I really didn't know the extent of his abilities.

I will start by saying I did not read the comics, so I do not know if my critiques are with a comic storyline or the movie plot. However without using any spoilers, the movie seemed to be less involved than previous movies. The additional cast seemed to flatten the depth of characters significantly. I even had issue with the main protagonist storyline. It felt forced and improbable (even by captain America storylines).
Overall, there is still entertainment value. My son loved it, and it's something we can share. I liked the movie, but it's not Winter Solider.",1476835200,,636,4.738738738738738

Don't want to say too much about this movie for those who haven't seen it, but I was definitely ""Team Captain"" all the way!!!

None of the characters feel true to themselves, solely to create tension in the ""plot"". Even the limited action scenes are poorly done on the computer, most sped up too much or chopped to pieces. And to top it all off, Hollywood reminds how much they want the government's hands in everything. A true waste of time and money; skip this film.",1476576000,8,432,4.773333333333333

The action sequences are out of this world. Killer performances by Downey, Evans, Johansson, Stan
and Mackie. My only problem with the film (and the Avengers generally) is that there are actually
TOO many characters -- difficult to keep track of all of them. Other than that, a great movie. Looking

Movie didn't follow the exact plotline or storyboard as originally outlined by Kirby, Lee - or in this case, Brubaker? No big deal. Provided that the underlying story, themes, and character dichotomies that make the comics so compelling are conveyed to the audience, I'm usually pretty good. This movie (don't call it a film) fell down in pretty much all these areas. Was it a fun ride, with cool action sequences and solid writing? Sure. Did it capture the rich themes that made the Civil War sp compelling? Not at all. Virtually every casual fan I've talked to who's seen the movie asked me the following question: ""Can you explain to me again why they're all fighting? I don't get it."" That's not a good sign.",1476403200,2,874,4.608974358974359

This wasn't ""Captain America"" it was the Avengers plus (they brought Ant-Man into the group and introduced a new superhero that I think my hubby said was called ""black panther"", etc.).  I'm still not too happy with them turning Jarvis into a pseudo superhero rather than the nice unseen voice of the personable computer he had been, but I guess they can't turn back now.  No matter what we love all of the Avenger, Thor, Iron Man and Captain America movies.  Can't wait for the next one.  We would definitely recommend this movie.",1476230400,2,687,4.636363636363637

The villain was just so so.  A lot of Marvel movies suffer from this in my opinion.  Outside of Loki a lot of the villains just seem like after thoughts to me.  Do not take that though as a compliant on the this movie.  I would put this near the top of all movies in the MCU so far.  Really the only one I would put above it would be the first Avengers movie.  Some of this is a matter of opinion but I would prefer that future movie's in the MCU feel a little more serious.  Not to give anything away but one of the big battle scenes in this movie never really feel to serious.  Where as Batman vs Superman was maybe to dark and serious.  A lot of movies in the MCU just feel a little to light for my tastes.  It feels at times like no one is really in danger.  That does not take away from this movie though.  It is still very entertaining and of the best superhero movies to come out.  This is highly recommended.",1476144000,,1076,4.033175355450237

There are so many characters yet at the end you feel like you got to interact and enjoy what each of them brought to the table. This is significantly different from the comic in terms of storyline but the movie tackles the same thematic tones in it's own way. Chris Evans and Robert Downey jr. were by far the best choices to bring these characters to life. The move itself deals with some pretty serious political and humanitarian overtones as well as how far friendship can be tested.

7707590,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Never get into a fight with an Avenger when death isn't...I've got Marvelitis--a general malaise with all things heroic that has put me in an unfairly critical mindset. Story is well-crafted, topical, and ends with that openness we've come to expect, yet I struggled to see the conflict as anything cataclysmic partly because I didn't feel relations between the characters were sufficiently compromised in previous installments or in this one to merit any true worry as a viewer. There was plenty for me to see reasonably as levers that pushed the heroes to one side or another but seemed more like kids play-fighting then someone goes too far, and then feelings get hurt. Everything else about this movie works really well: acting, conflict, resolution, etc. But Stark and Cap always had more of a tense bromance than a real rivalry. I think because I could never envision them in a paradigm where killing one another was ever going to be a viable option. And that's why ""Civil"" is the emphatic word here. One hero is sidelined accidentally and another incapacitated to end an escalating fight. Neither dies. If death isn't available, and the audience doesn't believe it ever will be, then the true tension of the unknown will always be out of reach.",1475884800,,1251,4.877934272300469

7707605,2,B01D9EUNB4,"This movie was all spectacle and is otherwise plain awful. What's really inexcusable are the glowing reviews promoting the ""sophistication"" of the film. There is no depth here. The circus of characters waver between somber and cartoonish behavior. The plot is exceptionally bad. Almost minor in the grand failure of this movie, but this is really an ""Avengers"" story and doesn't belong in the Captain America"" franchise. I'm convinced this was the result of fulfilling contracts with all the actors and screenwriters rather than producing a fun action movie. In the spectrum of CGI heavy saccharine drivel being punched out of Hollywood this film sits somewhere between the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and Transformers 4: Age of Extinction.

Events that should serve as the emotional core are presented haphazardly and ideas that should serve as the intellectual core are poorly presented leaving much of the action coming across as hollow. Despite that, the mechanics of the movie are spot on - it's as big and bombastic as you would expect, with fantastic action scenes, clever dialogue, solid performances and great special effects.

Steve Roger will always to what he thinks is the right thing to do, no matter the peer pressure, or the trouble he gets into. It is an endearing virtue of the character. The fight scenes are amazing.
If you are a fan of the Captain America films this is a must have movie. If you haven't seen them all three are must see. The character is great. Chris Evens does an amazing job in these films. He so looks the part of the comic book Captain America.

7707685,5,B01D9EUNB4,"The movie industry cranks out comic book movies every time we turn around now days it seems. I know Marvel Studios is responsible for many of them too. While I've enjoyed most of Marvel's movies, I was truly hoping this wasn't another ""Avengers"" type deal. Been there done that - right?!

I was not disappointed - Civil War is so much more than any other MCU movie to date. It was refreshing. I'm very excited about the new MCU direction we'll see in November with Dr. Strange going forward to 2017's movies.

I'm biased to the entire Captain America story line anyway but Civil War was so much more than a comic book movie about heroes fighting each other. This move has real life lessons in it that will benefit all of society if we choose to listen. It does an excellent job portraying why each hero chose their side, neither side was right or wrong, but the consequences can be severe even with the best intentions. This stuff happens in real life all the time - happening now in our society on a larger scale because people don't want to stop, talk, and listen. Let's figure it out right?!

In traditional Marvel Studio fashion the writing/directing is Superb!!!  The acting.....A++ - all of the actor/actress were outstanding. A big SHOUT OUT to Black Panther and Spiderman - both of you have a bright future in the MCU and welcome!

If you have chosen not to watch this movie because you think its about heroes fighting each other....blah...blah...blah - you're missing out on a deeper story line that has real implications on our own society if we continue on the path we're on.",1475539200,6,1586,4.590106007067138

Captain America, Americas quintessential good guy, who by a twist of fate becomes the ""Bad Guy"" and Ironman Americas Rebel, who becomes the hero, but is he really?!? This movie bring in some epic newcomers to the Avenger scope.. Spiderman and Black Panther are now on the radar!  The movie starts with an incident that results in the Avengers being basically forced to chose, work for the UN or disband and retire. The Arch Nemesis or Villain in this movie, is a man so bent on revenge he is willing to do what it takes to pit the Avengers against each other, and sadly he succeeds.

One half of me is like Oh heck yes!!! Bring it on and lemme choose my side.. Team Captain America or Team Ironman, but a big part of me is saddened that those heros, who we have grown to love are now at each others throats.

Overall this movie has lots and lots and dare i say LOTS of fighting, destruction as well as a few heart wrenching moments.  It's on par with any of the big budget action adventure films out there.  I know I'll watch it over and over, because honestly I like this kind of mindless film, where you don't have to think too much but can enjoy the overall story line such as it is.

If you are a superhero aficionado, yeah this isn't a movie for you, it's not true to the comic books, but for those of us 'hacks"" or Sunday paper comic strip readers, this movie satisfies the need for superheros, villains and lots of action adventure!

Although I liked the first one, First Avenger, it definitely fails in comparison,  The second film, Winter Soldier, sorta kinda sets this one up with the return of the Captain's friend forcing him to have to choose between the friend of his youth and the team he now calls family.  With the inclusion of the whole Avenger team sans Hulk and Thor, this could have easily been another Avengers movie following Age of Ultron.  Civil War will not disappoint!  As a fan of both Marvel and DC comics, I love the deep development of characters and inter-story plot lines that plant the seeds for other character films.

I loved all the movies individually but put them together and it was just OK. It is a definite yes on renting but glad I missed the theater or buying it. Stan made a couple appearances like he usually does and those were always fun, but the ""Civil War"" aspect was a bit much and more about egos than characters. Only watched once, usually watch Marvel twice.",1475539200,,492,4.666666666666667

7707732,5,B01D9EUNB4,"First off I have read the comics and have seen the movie about 5 times now. I was rooting for team Cap in the movie the whole time just like  when I was reading the comics. However the Russo brothers did a great job in making Starks cause and reasoning throughout the movie sympathetic. This is good because in the comics he was a complete douche bag. I had a lot of sympathy for Stark throughout the movie even though I was rooting for team Cap. I could especially sympathize with Stark when he tells Cap he had a rough childhood and that he really disliked his father but absolutely loved his mother.
This was a spectacular movie and arguably one of the best Marvel movies to ever be made! Cap vs Iron Man! What more could you want?",1475452800,,734,4.280575539568345

7707806,4,B01D9EUNB4,"I thought the split among the super heroes well done. Now that they've had many fights with all the various bad guys, the normal population has become tired of being collateral damage during those battles. They can see what both sides can do, and there's a growing fear among the world's leaders that the Avengers will become something they can't control.

So there are to be new rules, new laws, to govern their actions. And may among the Avengers don't like the fact they can't respond to danger as, and when, they see fit.

And there's someone out there, whose planning to take them out, by pitting them against each other.",1475193600,,626,4.63063063063063
7707807,3,B01D9EUNB4,"I want to start out by saying that I actually enjoyed this movie. Even though for me its the lesser of the three Captain America films (the first one may be my favorite Avengers movie of them all, and I doubt this one will end up with even half of the repeat viewings Winter Soldier has received thus far), its still fun to watch. The action was top-notch, and I had no issues with expanding the Marvel Universe by introducing another big gun. At some point I hope to get around to reviewing the other Avenger films, but considering this one is the most recent, I figure I could start here.

I like the idea of real world consequences for comic book characters. Its way too easy to wreck the joint and walk away, and at times it certainly seems to be that way in the Comic Book world. That won't fly in the film realm, however, and consequences is what this film attempts to entertain.

The long and the short of it is that the United Nations wants to put a clamp on the Avengers, attempting to control the group through the Sokovia Accords, as some see it as being a threat. This development puts the Avengers at odds with each other, and they end up taking sides. Half of the group aligns itself with Tony Stark and his willingness to be under the UNs thumb, while the other half agrees with Steve Rogers in that the UN may ask the Avengers to do something with which they do not agree, effectively turning the Avengers into the UNs Hit Squad.

Ultimately, the question being asked is this one: should the Avengers be allowed to continue acting under their own authority?

However, a leap of logic is required for the film to exist in the first place, and the Captain America vs. Iron Man Main Event exposes a huge plot hole.

After he came out as Iron Man, Stark spent the majority of the second Iron Man film trying to keep his creation out of the hands of the military, his thinking being that the military will turn his technology into a weapon. So, naturally, there was a distrust of the military, and, by extension, the US government. In addition, as a member of the Avengers and an associate of SHIELD subsequent to the events of the first Avengers film, one would expect hed be privy to any number of behind-the-scenes activities by both International and Terrorist organizations. Unless hes completely and grotesquely nave as to whats going on in the world around him, especially the stuff thats not reported by the Press, by the time of the events of Civil War Tony should have developed a healthy distrust of the leadership of many nations governments, including his own. Armed with all of this information, one would think that if the United Nations came along and attempted to put the brakes on the Avengers, he would have joined with Captain America in telling the UN where they could stick the Accords.

To put it bluntly, outside of plot convenience, I cannot accept that somebody like Tony Stark would be dumb enough to buy what the UN is selling and believe that they would not ask the Avengers to do some of their dirty work.

As for the plot hole, for Zemos plan to come together, he needed Iron Man, Captain America AND the Winter Soldier to be in the same spot. While he probably could have counted on Captain Americas detective work to get he and the Winter Soldier to the mountain lair, theres no way he could have expected that Falcon would be willing to share its location with Stark. Its as if Zemo said I know that Captain America will show up with the Winter Soldier. While I haven't worked out the particulars concerning Iron Man, I know that he will get here somehow. By assuming that everything will go according to plan, it appears that Zemo consulted with Dr. Evil.

Again, I enjoyed the film, and I like the attempt by the filmmakers to bring real world consequences to the actions of comic book superheroes, but for all of the fireworks, these two issues really dampened my enthusiasm.",1475193600,,3923,4.50773558368495

I was even more disappointed when I registered it with my Disney Movies Anywhere account and it does not go to my collection. They did better with past Marvel movies but this time it seems to be all about the money they can make. I am tired of being forced to buy 3D movies to get digital copies when I don't watch 3D. It's not like I plan to go out and buy all the 3D gear to be able to. And in a way I find it to be discriminatory to people who can not watch 3D movies.

(Make no mistake, this is an Avengers film. Just not in name because the ""core 6"" aren't all there this time out.) You may end up feeling a bit conflicted with your heroes battling each other, especially over something ethereal like ideology, when we're used to them being able to overcome any differences to combat the ""big bad"". But the characters are still what drives this series, and they're just as enjoyable as ever. When movies are this well written, acted, and crafted, it's not difficult to just let the politics in the story slip away and have a good time. [Of course, I base this on not being a reader of the comics, so I have no pre-conceived notion of how this story played out on the page.]",1474934400,,842,4.582781456953643

7707883,2,B01D9EUNB4,"Ugh.  Another high buck ""blockbuster"" with great special effects, excellent acting, and a plot that's so lame in an attempt to be politically correct it just kills the movie.  The premise is that the heroes go in and defeat some big baddie, but the world is getting tired of how many people are getting killed as collateral damage. So they want to reign in the heroes...  This all seems like a political statement on the US going around killing the terrorist baddies and leaving a pile of collateral damage.  Sooooo maybe the hidden moral to this lame story is that the US needs to be reigned in???  Unfortunately the characters in this story are only smart when it comes to sarcastic remarks and aren't able to simply say ""we didn't cause the damage, the baddies were the cause...""

7707888,3,B01D9EUNB4,"LOL, Stark, is the one who made the right decision. Cap, is pulling the same stuff that the US pulls all the time. Syria, is a great example. The US is there illegally, as the Syrian, govt. haven't given them permission to be there. This movie, is FULL of propaganda, and subliminal massages aimed at impressionable children. I wish they'd leave politics out of these movies. At first it seems like Cap, is doing the right thing, until you realize that he's ignoring the vote of 117 other countries, and couldn't care less about international laws. (Cough America, Cough) This whole ""Russia"" thing, is getting old as hell. Let's not forget who stopped Hitler- It wasn't Uncle Sam, it was Russia. In the Winter Soldier, it was the same. I mean, how does an American, get caught by Nazi's, get experimented on by a SWISS Dr. then turn into an Russian assassin, being controlled by Hydra/the real embodiment of the CIA? Heck, they even managed to throw in a line about Iranians, and nukes. The very mention of the CIA, in a good light, is laughable, and also means that this movie received funding from the govt. (Can't talk about govt org's, or show military hardware otherwise. Look it up.) Every time they say ""Avengers"" They might as well be saying ""America"" Except when the US brings Democracy/freedom, it comes at the cost of a destabilized govt, and uses LOTS of depleted uranium.

The second viewing gave me a better understanding of the plot. The main theme was trust, choices, and fracture of relationships. The Avengers(not an Avengers movie, but still) are being tested by the greatest threat to day. Inner conflict. Without talking about the plot, I will say the conflict, trust and emotion in this movie's plot are central and the characters betrayed them very well. The climax was so emotional, we get how we got here. Beyond the regular characters, having Black Panther and Spider-Man here was awesome and the airport scene was the closest thing to an Avengers movie it will blow you away.

Just a thought; why when anyone in movies grows to superhuman size, they move in slow motion. I would think that a person that is 20ft tall would move just as fast as a normal size person. When Ant Man shrinks he doesn't run faster than a normal human, but grow to 10x the size and you automatically slow down?

Definitely better than Age of Ultron (even though it is a Captain America movie it is more like Avengers 2.1. I won't spoil anything but will just say it has a decent story line directed by the Russos (although they botched up Zemo for comics fans) and good comic book fight scenes that make it a good add if you're looking for a superhero movie.  The Captain America movies have more of an espionage and action feel than just a comic action movie and in saying that I've enjoyed the three Captain America movies more than the three Iron Man movies.

As far as extras go there is a featurette about the making of the movie that is split into two parts. Fairly interesting. Deleted and extended scenes are pretty light and only one really adds anything. Gag reel - meh.",1474761600,,869,4.325153374233129

7708041,3,B01D9EUNB4,"How can such a beautiful and action packed film be so boring?

The story in here is heavily contrived and borderline bad. They have several characters betray their own character. For example, Stark who is basically an anarchist sides with authority and conformity. I understand they need tension and opposition to make the story premise work but it just didn't fit as presented.

There is a ton of action. Anyone wanting too see their fan-duel match ups of some heroes, here is your chance. For some reason classic characters are updated and powered way up so they can hang with the bigger super heroes, yet Black widow and Hawkeye did not get an overhaul.

The story is super flimsy. Apparently the mastermind can predict the future and read minds. Yes super villain plots can be very convoluted and misleading but this one relies way too heavily on chance and the heroes in-fighting.

The costumes are good, the action is amazing, and the film is fast paced. If it weren't for the weak story line this would be a 5 star classic.",1474761600,,1030,4.6740331491712706

7708057,3,B01D9EUNB4,"I really want to give this movie one more star, because I think the Russo brothers did a great job making this a serious movie and avoiding the silliness and wisecracks that are typical of mainstream superhero movies. It is believed, I suppose, that if a fantasy/superhero movie were made as a serious drama, it wouldn't be any ""fun."" Or, because of the subject matter, it's impossible to make serious dramas out of such movies. M. Night Shayamalan's Unbreakable proved that wrong a long time ago, and the Dark Knight trilogy made it ""ok"" for filmmakers/fans/reviewers to take these movies seriously. Anyway, hats off to the Russos for that choice.

Unfortunately, despite the parade of excellent Marvel movies that we've seen over the last 15 years, I have significant issues with this film (even though I do think it is a good movie). First, the minor concerns. I feel like the fight scenes are over-choreographed. A lot of times it looks like the characters are dancing instead of fighting. There's a general lack of ""grittiness"" in the combat. Unless one hero is fighting one of the other heroes, no move ever really seems to fail and no punch ever misses (kind of like Legolas in The Lord of the Rings). And during the face off at the airport, I think the Russos show a lack of courage in the way they directed the fight. Every dramatic or interesting move, it seems, gets undone. Iron Man has a trick up his sleeve to get Captain America's shield--enter Spider Man who snatches it away. Great move! Except Cap gets it right back. Let's see some consequences--make Cap fight without his shield. Spidey binds Cap's hands together with webs. No problem--Cap holds up his hands and Hawkeye shoots off the webs, like it never really happened. Whenever one of team Iron Man is about to deal team Cap a significant blow, suddenly Scarlet Witch puts a stop to it out of nowhere. You can't make a really good battle out of mostly thwarted moves. Also, the Russos didn't have the balls to have a member of team Cap actually take down Rhodey, which would have potentially led to future animosity and, more importantly, character motivation. They made it accidental friendly fire from Vision, and therefore, completely forgivable--Total bait and switch from the advertising campaign which showed Tony holding Rhodey in his arms as if he were dead, making it appear as if Cap or someone on his team was responsible for it.

A more significant concern I have is that the plot (and I know the source comes from the comics, but still...) very much resembles the plot of X-Men 3 when the heroes have to take sides on the issue of whether mutants should have to be registered and whether the mutant ""cure"" should even exist.

Also, I'm confused about the way the characters were represented. In the comics, superheroes have widely varying levels of power. Some are clearly more powerful than others. In this movie (with the exception of Vision and Scarlet Witch), the heroes all seem roughly equal in their abilities. Look, Captain American is a great character, but he's only a human--albeit, a human at the peak physical abilities possible for a human--with a shield. If he were punching Iron Man like he does in the movie, he would break his hands. Tony Stark's armor is not tin foil. And yet, Tony's suit warns him during one particular fist fight that ""you can't beat him hand to hand!"" The interesting aspect of Captain America isn't his powers, it's his character. His real powers are his leadership, courage, and vision. But for someone who is supposed to be a great leader and decision maker, he makes some really poor decisions, which leads me to my next criticism...

The directors said they wanted to show the heroes finishing up a character arc, but the problem is, the characters have become the opposite of what they once were. That's not an arc, that's a mis-interpretation or misrepresentation of the characters. Cap was right to oppose SHIELD when he found out it was infiltrated by HYDRA, but it strains belief that he would turn out, in this film, to be pro-vigilante! Am I to understand that he would really, for example, violate the sovereignty of other nations if he personally felt it was a good idea? That he would defy a government that might ask specifically that he not get involved? Again, the reasoning strains credibility. His argument is basically, ""if I feel like I should get involved, I'm going to."" From what I can tell, the only thing that was being asked of the Avengers is that they refrain from getting involved unless specifically requested by the military/government/country...whatever. It seems like a rational middle-ground that a person like Captain America would be particularly receptive to, especially considering that the argument in favor of the regulation rests on the fact that the Avengers are responsible for untold damage and probably thousands of deaths. Also, there's nothing saying that if the regulating bodies are destroyed or are too overwhelmed to request help, the Avengers couldn't step in. Moreover, since much of Cap's value is in his decision making ability, he sure lets his emotions dictate his actions a lot, very unlike someone who is known for rational thinking and keeping a cool head. In Civil War he's like the cliched character who always says ""I'm going with you!"" on missions, against all good advice because of his personal emotional investment. Falcon is also strangely pro-vigilante considering that he's also a military man, like Cap, invested in a command structure. Presumably, though, he's with cap mainly because he's Cap's friend.

As for Tony Stark, the Russos have made another incomprehensible change, but this one doesn't show Stark acting quite as much out of character as Captain America. Still, he's ends up in a place basically the opposite of where he started, going from vigilante in Iron Man 1 & 2, in which he tells the government flat out that they can't have the Iron Man technology, to strict anti-vigilante in Civil War. However, his change is presaged somewhat in Iron Man 3, when he is seen backing away from his personal need to play the superhero and save the day. He also seems to have grown a little weary of the responsibility of being Iron Man. There is also a brief scene when he is informed that the actions of the Avengers in Age of Ultron resulted in the death of a small innocent boy. It's rather obligatory and not entirely convincing as a motivation for Stark to change his worldview.

And the other characters, well... It's never entirely clear what their motivations are with regard to fighting one another. In the marketing, the premise seemed to be that the characters were fighting because they had taken different sides in the debate over the Sokovia Accords. However, the character motivations are quite varied...
Stark's desire to keep Scarlet Witch under wraps doesn't make much sense, and Scarlet Witch's need to need to get out RIGHT NOW! doesn't make much sense either, so her motivation is that she's a brat basically. Vision is fighting on Team Tony because he's already allied with Tony, I guess. Spider-man is with Tony because Tony went to meet him and Spidey wants to impress Mr. Stark. What are Peter Parker's views on the accords? Rhodey is a military man, who has faith in a governing body, so his motivation is pretty natural, actually. Black Widow makes an argument in favor of the Avengers being under some sort of oversight, but then she turns against Team Tony, helping Cap and Bucky Escape. I have no idea why Scott Lang/Ant Man is there. I don't know why Hawkeye is fighting except that, according to Jeremy Renner, Cap called him before Tony did. Bucky is only trying to clear his name. T'Challa is only there to kill Bucky. Almost none of it has to do with the differing political opinions. The premise would suggest that this whole ""civil war"" is about one group of superheroes fighting against another group that has different beliefs, but as it turns out, all of these people are fighting because of the convictions of only a few of them.

The movie just doesn't have a good coherent premise. One side of the argument over the accords is pretty clearly right. The request by the government is pretty reasonable. It's not as if they're requiring all the Avengers to be microchipped or something. And it's hard to believe any of these people should be allowed to Assemble and use their powers whenever and wherever they feel like they should. But also, there are only a couple of characters who have really strong feelings about the issue, but the movie makes it seem like that's what the whole ""civil war"" is about, when it's really just about a guy manipulating them all into fighting each other.",1474675200,28,8735,4.796148738379814
7708058,5,B01D9EUNB4,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!

This past summer started off with the biggest superhero clash anyone has ever seen. EVER!!! Captain America vs Iron Man, Vision vs Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man vs Spider-Man, Black Panther vs Winter Soldier, and it all is so much fun to watch. Everything that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to has come to this one epic clash between our favorite heroes. Marvel Phase 3 starts off huge and will continue to do so with Doctor Strange in November with Benedict Cumberbatch at the helm alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen.

Picking up some time after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, government tensions are rising to have the Avengers registered and work for a special United Nations panel. This sits well with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) but not as good with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). Now Cap and his team must work to protect his lifelong friend Bucky/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) from being apprehended by Stark and his team. But in the shadows, the stage is set as a mysterious new enemy arises.

Now everything in this MCU entry is done really well. And I couldn't be more happier with the turnout.

The cast features a massive ensemble that includes returners Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Elizabeth Olsen, Frank Grillo, Paul Bettany, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, Sebastian Stan and Emily Van Camp. They all still man their roles and this time around, they don't like to mess with their acting when they are onscreen for their given time.

And this film features some surprising new characters too. That I am going into full detail on the characters that caught my eye the most.

I gotta talk about Black Panther first. Black Panther is a really great character to introduce into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When I watched the Marvel Phase 3 announcement video, I saw the Black Panther logo in the lineup and I thought to myself 'They have to cast Black Panther and put him in the MCU somewhere.' And I was so excited to see that Chadwick Boseman has taken the role of T'Challa/Black Panther himself. Boseman, let me tell ya, did not disappoint me at all!!! He was such a kick ass Black Panther and he does not mess around. I am super excited to see where Marvel takes the new King of Wakanda and how they tell his own story when it hits theaters in 2018. Great job Chadwick Boseman!!! Keep it up.

Next up: Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Now we know by now that Spider-Man is probably one of the most famous cinema characters since his very first movie appearance back in summer 2002. I have loved this character ever since that first movie as he went through two incarnations. I loved the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man a lot more than the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man. But when it was revealed that Marvel and Sony have reached a verdict, I was screaming with joy!!! Spider-Man is now an official part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and he is played by Tom Holland who did not disappoint!!! In this version, he is just a high school kid who has spider-like abilities and can't reveal his identity to anyone. He is just a kid who is in the developmental stages of being a big-time hero and Tony Stark hooks up with him which was so much fun to watch. And I am excited to see what Marvel will do with Tom Holland as Spider-Man in next year's Spider-Man Homecoming!!! Keep on swinging Spidey!!!

Now that all the heroes are covered, there is the whole villain situation. I know that Marvel has had problems with their villains in some movies (biggest for me was Abomination, Whiplash and Justin Hammer). But we have had some great ones too besides Loki and Thanos like Alexander Pierce, Aldrich Killian, Ultron, HYDRA, Obadiah Stane and Yellowjacket among other villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The villain in this movie is Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo. And he was a very interesting villain. When I first heard that Daniel Bruhl was up for a villain role in this movie I was thinking about Baron Zemo. And it was confirmed so I was like 'ALRIGHT!!! We finally get Zemo with his purple hood.' But he doesn't have the purple hood in the movie. He is a Sokovian colonel who was out to split the Avengers right down the middle. And he says that he witnessed his family getting crushed when the Avengers were fighting Ultron in Sokovia. He also was looking for a video file to show to Tony which is the death of his parents unknowingly thanks to Bucky which resulted in Cap and Tony kicking ass at one another. Because of Bruhl's German accent, I think that pretty much fits his role in this movie. Though I would've liked to have seen him put the purple hood on. His villain in my personal opinion is a lot better than Justin Hammer was in Iron Man 2. And I sure have higher hopes that Marvel will do a better job with their villains in future movies. We already have Cate Blanchett, Mads Mikkelsen, Michael Keaton, Michael B. Jordan and Josh Brolin in the villains lineup. And there is speculation that Chiwetel Ejiofor (Baron Mordo) and Kurt Russell (Ego) will be villains too.

And the action scenes were fantastic too!! The one that got me the most was the epic airport fight scene. Everyone was fighting each other and I was so impressed. And it was so cool seeing Paul Rudd's Ant-Man grow into a massive Giant-Man. What got me speculating about Giant Man is if Michael Douglas' Hank Pym taught Scott to grow into a massive giant for the epic fight. Who knows. But everyone showed their powers and I was so impressed with Elizabeth Olsen doing more of her telekinesis power when Spider-Man was jumping from car to car. Great action!!!

So I totally recommend this movie to any MCU fan or superhero fan in general. It is such a great time. You will not be disappointed.",1474675200,,5782,4.631219512195122

7708060,4,B01D9EUNB4,"I am a fan of the Marvel series of movies, with the first Captain America movie being one of my favorites of the bunch.  Although I didn't like this one as much as I did the first Captain America movie, it is entertaining and fun to watch.  The movie is fast paced and action packed from the start and doesnt let up very often.  There is plenty of action to keep you involved throughout the whole movie with plenty of battles and fight scenes through.  There are plenty of superheroes in this movie and it was fun to see some of the lesser known (at least to me) characters in the Marvel universe.  Unfortunately Thor and Hulk are not in this one.  I especially liked the Black Panther character.  I am not so sure I like the new Spider Man actor though and I thought the villain was a bit weak.  Although I do think the story is not as good as some of the previous Marvel stories, I do think it adds a new dimension to the stories and gives us something different than just the heroes fighting the bad guys.  One of the flaws of the story is that there is a lot going on with a lot of characters (maybe too many) at the same time.  I really would have liked to see some of the included characters with their own movie (like they did with Ant Man) to help provide some backstory, such as with the Black Panther.

The special effects are good as always with this series and if you enjoyed the previous Marvel movies, there is definitely something to like in this one.

The fight scenes long and tedious and Captain America's monologues have become droll and predictable. They shoved as many new and barely used characters as they possibly could in this movie and I'm guessing the studio hoped the monotonous fight scenes would distract the audience enough for them not to notice the gaping holes. Assuming Ant Man is still on probation after spending years in prison, why would he risk losing his daughter again by fighting with the CA side?  And why isn't Spider Man rotting in the underwater prison with the rest of the gang that got caught? I could go on, but my coffee is getting cold.

7708128,5,B01D9EUNB4,"As they convert the  classic comic book characters into movies they are working to create one long intertwined story.  Stan Lee has created modern mythos & through the guise of Sci-Fi they touch on very real subject matter that is current & relevant almost mirroring today's headlines!!!  But this is no real surprise reaching the masses through "" hidden stories"" about current affairs dates back to William Shakespeare time & even further back.  These fantastic , incredible super heroes' are dealing with "" False Flag's"", "" Operation Northwood"" type Government scam's & "" Manchurian Candidates""...poor Bucky.  They are broaching all this touchy subject matter under the safety of being able to claim, "" Its just Comic Book Sci-Fi.""  "" Captain America: Civil War"" is a thrill ride of a action movie & still addresses current "" Hot Topic's"" Like how much can we afford to give up to the Government under the guise of maintaining peace & safety?  Are we going to look back in the future & point to a date in time & say "" This is when we lost our freedom?""  This movie is asking those very questions, while at the same time entertaining us with mind blowing action & special effects.

7708136,2,B01D9EUNB4,"I love and have always loved superhero movies. Marvel in particular was my favorite. I saw The Avengers five times in the theatre, and it was the movie that made me want to know more about the comic book world. I was not overly impressed with Age of Ultron but was ecstatic to see Civil War. After reading the comic book version of this story, I could not wait to see the real thing unfold before me. What a colossal disappointment. I cried when I left the movie because I could not believe what I had seen. It has none of the quality that the first Avengers movie had. The acting was horrible, the writing was cringe worthy, and the plot was ridiculous. After this I will have very low expectations of Marvel. I liken this film to a slap fight between to middle school girls. So bad it almost makes you want to laugh and cry simultaneously. Don't waste your time on this. Head over to the X-Men franchise...heck...even DC has a better thing going right now. I only gave this movie two stars because of the lingering respect I have for the actors and their hard work.",1474502400,2,1067,4.366834170854271
7708137,2,B01D9EUNB4,Boring. Had no stakes or consequences to keep me interested or worried that the group was truly divided and might not get back together. Possibly the worst of the franchise. Then again maybe not as bad as IM2 but still pretty bad.,1474502400,,230,4.5

7708162,2,B01D9EUNB4,"I really enjoyed ""Phase 1"" of Marvel's films, the movies that introduced us to each of these characters, with the ultimate payoff in the first ""Avengers"" movie. It seems with ""Phase 2"" there was quite a dip in quality, the films just weren't as good, the characters maybe getting a bit stale, and with the exception of the ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", most were basically forgettable. ""Age of Ultron"" was just too long, and introduced so many characters, that I just didn't care by the time the end credits roll.

""Civil War"" suffers from the same issues ""Ultron"" had. Way too many characters, and a thread-bare story that just seems tossed together to get the Avengers to fight among themselves. And while the special effects are very good, the manic camera movement and the quick-cut editing was headache inducing.

This is a movie for Marvel fan-boys, and that's cool, but as a casual fan (and maybe it's just that I'm burnt out on superhero movies?) ""Civil War"" was a slog to get through.",1474502400,3,1011,4.738636363636363

7708216,3,B01D9EUNB4,"I don't know, something about it didn't keep my interest.  I thought it started out well and Spider Man was a hoot.  But overall the fight scenes weren't as good and it needed Hulk and Thor.  Must be just me most seemed to have really liked this movie.  I thought the fight scenes were kind of lame and they were all pulling their punches and trading off who they fought with.  But no winners in the fights, so what was the point.  It was like two nuns battling.  It's worth having to be part of my collection, when I can buy it cheaply used.  It just didn't live up to what I was hoping for.",1474416000,,592,4.086956521739131

I thought the only highlight in this film was Spiderman. I know, at heart, the entire Marvel world remains a comic book series but character development (Captain America's decision to put friend ahead of justice and law, for example) simply didn't exist in this movie -- except the few minutes of Spiderman. So I know the MCU writers CAN do it.

They just didn't do it anywhere else in this movie.

And what's next? Is Captain America going to get the power of flight? I realize they showcase Chris Evans' bod (the first Avengers featured Chris Evans' behind, this one his arms) but geez.",1474416000,,798,4.489655172413793

7708385,4,B01D9EUNB4,"I already love Chris Evans so no contest there; doesn't matter what movie he's in, CA, Cellular with Kim Bassinger, you name it; I'll love it. I was disappointed with no appearance from Gwynneth Paltrow, she's also a favorite. I was pleasantly pleased with the added characters too like Vision and Ant Man. I liked the plot in dealing with collateral damage. I'd recently seen Eye in the Sky which dealt with the same issue. To me its clear: When dealing with enemies who's objective is to destroy as much life as possible, no matter the age or position in the conflict, loss of innocent life is unavoidable. But we have to weigh the outcomes: If we do nothing at the risk of those in harms way, more will die and on a much larger scale than if we are vigilant, careful to minimize death and destroy the enemy. The rules of conflict and engagement are gone. Our enemy fights without conscience or mercy. We must keep our moral compass, avoid collateral damage, but examine every engagement individually, for the greater good. Though it hurts, those who love America and peace, will understand.",1474329600,3,1093,4.668393782383419
7708386,2,B01D9EUNB4,"What happens when a franchise has outlived itself? Captain America: Civil War, that's what happens. The script is so boring I found it hard to follow, but in truth silly things like plot, dialogue, actors are not needed for a non-stop battle scene broken here and there by scowls, sad looks, and a few inconsequential quips. Direction? ""Just display the emotions from A to B,"" in between lengthy shield bashing and vehicle tossing. Who had the contract to hype this film to the dizzying heights reviews promised? That agency is underpaid, in my opinion. They could clearly take any sort of high tech, low content junk and convince the paying public they've got to have it.",1474329600,3,672,4.801724137931035

7708481,3,B01D9EUNB4,"As with any other Marvel movie, Captain America: Civil War is packed with heaps of action and flawless CGI. However, the story line of the movie seemed a bit bland and left a lot to be desired. It seemed to be more of a filler to bridge the gap for another movie, perhaps. I would recommend renting this movie, but not buying it.",1474243200,2,329,4.238095238095238

7708494,5,B01D9EUNB4,"It was a great movie that just grows off of the well established Marvel Universe.  Worth paying to rent or buy.  I would recommend purchasing as you will want to re-watch this one more than once.

Only downside for me was that I was a little disenchanted with Tony Stark all of a sudden being pro-government and pro-people-telling-him-what-to-do.  Very unlike Tony compared to the Iron Man movies.  That is just me though.

Also, I would recommend looking up ""What Thor & the Hulk were doing during Avengers Civil War"" on YouTube.  Hilarious!",1474243200,,542,4.826086956521739

I have loved the movies to date and watch them over and over but this one just does not do it for me for some reason.

I will watch it again and maybe I will finally enjoy it more; my hope is that this is just a bridge movie for a blockbuster to come.

My fear is that this movie is a move to the dark side like DC ""comics"" movies but only time will tell whether that is true or not.",1474243200,,456,3.7291666666666665

7708537,3,B01D9EUNB4,"These marvel superhero movies are really starting to blur the lines between each other.  I liked the first Captain America movie a lot.  But the sequel and this movie just feel like Avengers 3.  The cgi - I don't want to say it's bad, but it's so obvious... it's like watching a cartoon.  I know they are superheroes and all but the movement just doesn't look natural, there is no weight, no mass.  And what's up with Spider Man's eyes?  What they did there is just laughable, and even more cartoonish.  At it's heart there is a good story but much of it feels like it was only put there to pad out the time between fight scenes.  Newcomers to the CA series had best start with the first film because this one doesn't really seem like a Captain America movie to me at all.",1474243200,,772,4.275862068965517

It is over two hours but it just flies by and that is credit to the Russo brothers, they really outdid themselves and are great story tellers.

7708590,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War is one of the most engaging entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (""MCU""). Most notably, it poses the question: Are superheroes ever held accountable for the collateral damage they leave in their wake? This serves as the main conflict for the film, and brings many of the core Avengers to the forefront. Additionally, we are introduced to Black Panther and Spider-Man, and the climactic battle is both creative and thrilling, giving the latter two newcomers adequate time in the spotlight. With a denouement in the vein of The Empire Strikes Back between the now-ideologically-opposed Captain America and Iron Man, it's going to be interesting seeing how things lead up to Avengers: Infinity War.

While I generally enjoy the MCU films, not all of them break any new storytelling ground and have a tendency to recycle plot points. After feeling a little underwhelmed with the tonally-scattered Avengers: Age of Ultron, I approached this entry cautiously optimistic, and I got the superhero ensemble film I had hoped for. While Civil War is technically Captain America's film, it is very much a fully-fleshed ensemble superhero film, where Cap's main conflict serves as the foundation for the other heroes' conflict over the political action the world governments have taken to restrain their powers. Aside from the stellar acting, the fight scenes are impeccably choreographed and the special effects cutting edge.

Now, the Blu-ray: The image is what one would expect from a modern, special-effects extravaganza. Which is to say - Bold colors, balanced black levels, and strong detail. Aside from the obvious showcasing with the superhero suits and makeup, Civil War has some impressive cinematography; aerial shots of cities and landscapes get some additional mileage from this exceptionally clear transfer.

The sound is DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, with DVS and Dolby 5.1 French and Spanish language tracks. Again, very strong across the board with appropriate bombast and directionality with explosions and projectile weapons. There were times I felt the dialogue was a little on the ""loud""-end, but it's nevertheless clear and intelligible. The music is also equally impressive, and never drowned out by the film's chaotic action sequences.

This review is based on the Target exclusive, which in addition to the standard features (the same as in the general release), contains a behind-the-scenes featurette on Ant-Man and Winter Soldier that is available as a Disney Movie Rewards digital download. Among the standard extras, we get: United We Stand, Divided We Fall: The Making of Captain America: Civil War - A two-part documentary covering multiple production, and story aspects of the making of the film. Captain America: The Road to Civil War - A featurette about Captain America's role within this installment of the MCU. Iron Man: The Road to Civil War - A similar featurette, focused instead on Iron Man. Open Your Mind: Marvel's Doctor Strange Exclusive Sneak Peek - A run-of-the-mill promotional featurette on the upcoming Doctor Strange film. Four deleted & extended scenes that aren't incredibly remarkable. An entertaining gag reel. Finally, we get an audio commentary from the directors and the writers.

Fans of MCU will want to add this one to their collection. Those who are curious or unfamiliar/wary of MCU will want to at least rent it; I highly recommend Civil War for its intense action, and engaging storyline with contemporary political overtones.",1474156800,9,3505,5.274193548387097

I didn't know whether I was watching Marvel Avengers or TWILIGHT HALLOWEEN HEROES. If this movie could get any more boring it would.",1474156800,3,421,4.702702702702703
7708674,5,B01D9EUNB4,"This movie was really a sequel to all the various movies that have come before, and was as much an Ironman sequel as it was a Captain America one.  I will not go too much into the story, because to do so would be to give too much away. But there are elements of revenge, misdirection, and most of all consequences for the things that came before.  It is really the first attempt in the movies to deal with the collateral damage done to the ordinary public after the big climactic battles like those of the two Avengers movies, the second Thor movie etc.  The fallout of that collateral damage leads some characters to agreeing to let the United Nations decide when and where to deploy the superheros which begins to fracture the team.  What ultimately causes the biggest rift is a much larger story line involving Captain America, Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark.

This is really a transition movie bridging what has come before, with what we know is coming, specifically the Infinity Wars movie.  This movie leaves the Avengers team very much tattered, with Thor and Hulk conspicuously absent.  It very much leaves a question open as to where those characters will fall when they are brought back into the story line.  As most know this movie also introduces Black Panther, which I think is very well played by Chadwick Boseman, and yet another incarnation of Spider Man, this time played by Tom Holland.  In the main battle between the two teams, Spider Man and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) very much steal the scenes, both in terms of comedy and with what they bring to the fight.

For those who get the discs, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  For extras there is a commentary track on the film by the filmmakers (none of the cast), about an hour plus of making of and behind the scenes material and a gag reel.  There is also a short feature introducing the Doctor Strange movie.  Good for what is there.  The movie is not so complex where you would have no idea what is going on if you have not seen the other movies, but given the movies and to a smaller extent the various TV series are all telling a large overarching story the events of this movie will be easier to follow the more you have seen what has come before.  The acting is very good, and the special effects are top notch.  If you have superhero fatigue with all the various movies, or are just lukewarm to them in general, then this will probably not be for you.  For everybody else, while liking it or not will be subjective, I think most will find it enjoyable.",1474156800,2,2533,4.4480519480519485

7708692,4,B01D9EUNB4,I was disappointed War Machine didn't die in a grease fire (it's a joke people lighten up) but overall the movie was worth the rental price.  There are a lot of characters but the screen time is divided up well enough to tell the important backstories and still have some non critical but entertaining scenes without feeling like there's a bunch of filler material.  The fight scenes are well done and pretty balanced considering the range of heroes involved.  They make good use of the characters' abilities and equipment to show off at least some of what they are capable of.  The villain is more of a catalyst in this movie than a traditional front and center bad guy that jumps right into battle against the heroes but he definitely causes damage and not just physical damage.  I like this movie better than the last Avengers one and while I don't think it deserves a five star rating I feel ok about paying the rental fee.  With the state of movies these days that's a good thing.,1474070400,,985,4.536723163841808

Was it my criticism of the writers who clearly get their view of the world from a nonstop diet of liberal propaganda?...Glorifying the black panthers? WTF?! Africa is a country of murder, corruption and abject evil, and the Black Panther organization is a murderous gang of communists...But lets not let that stop the small brained writers from their political agenda.

7708709,4,B01D9EUNB4,"This is better than I had expected.  There's always been friction between the arrogant billionaire Tony Stark and the always-had-to-prove-himself kid from Brooklyn Steve Rogers. Push comes to shove in Civil War, Iron Man and Capt America are on opposite sides of giving control of the Avengers to the U.N.. I couldn't believe that Tony Stark was all for letting the U.N. decide when and where they could intervene. what a stupid move. Stark should know the  history of how the U.N. has miserably failed to live up the promise of bringing the world together.  It only serves to placate some nations, and bully others. Naming an Iranian to the UN Women's Rights Commission is just one of the spectacular idiocies committed by the UN. But I digress- obviously I am 400% on Capt America's team here.
Tony Stark seems quite comfortable allowing the Avengers who fought side by side with him become criminals, even helping to take them into custody  -and be imprisoned in an Draconian deep sea fortress. None of them were afforded due process, no trial, just deemed guilty by the U.N.. I'm sure GITMO prisoners have more rights.
Not surprisingly, Stark and the U.N.. Gestapos are falling for a trap.  Rogers sees it, and acts accordingly. Stark tries to stop him, with disastrous results.  The rift widens, but then the deception is discovered, and for a moment we hope they war is over.
 We are served another wrenching twist, some may see it coming, which brings us to a climactic battle.
In the end, no one wins.  The Avengers are bitter, wounded,and scarred...and still apart.  In the Marvel world, that leaves the world weak, vulnerable.. A perfect set up for the next movie.
Team Cap all the way!  I still don't understand why Tony Stark isn't fighting for the Avengers who are rotting in the UN prison. With friends like him...",1474070400,8,1828,4.7746031746031745

7708712,1,B01D9EUNB4,"If I had seen this movie in the theater, I would have walked out during the adolescent discussion for which way the New avenger crew should go with the UN sokovia accords.  SPOILER for the spoilt movie, chagrin, the premise that they are out of line or should be kept in check because of periodic collateral damage is possibly the most ludicrous and disappointing theme I have had to digest.  It is not like the avengers were partying or playing around when there were deaths.  They were doing everything in their power to limit and if possible stop far greater destruction that would have occurred without their intervention.  A young man was killed in sokovia during Ultron's attempt to bring ruin to the species, the PLANET.  The avengers went out of their way, during the effort to stop ultron, to also save as many as possible in sokovia and with the help of Nick Fury's timely rescue craft.  It was a miracle they saved anyone in sokovia and if they had not saved anyone in sokovia at least they saved a far greater population.

they are combating terrorist; they are not the terrorist.  Maximoff saves the people on the ground, including C. america, by controlling an explosion in this movie.  unfortunately, as she tried to remove the threat from the area, the blast is released and of course for the dodgy plot there is collateral damage.  The subsequent nonsense is to point the finger at the avengers as out of control.  Hilarious.

I have enjoyed the marvel movies and frankly love them, but, sh*t, to watch this movie is to accept the most insulting foundation I have seen to build a movie on.  It will be a while before I will make another effort to stomach the remainder of the movie, if ever.

For the review angels, the discs were round, wonderfully adorned, and functioned as advertised--at least up to finding the remote.  the bluray case was also ""wonderfully"" tidy.

word has it to swim in hollywood is to beg suspension of disbelief.  got it.  however, once the world is created from that suspension to then ask for additional suspension is to suggest to me something is wrong with the story.  ...in this context.",1474070400,10,2135,4.660427807486631

This is NOT the same movie you saw in the cimema. I'm so upset. I purchased it on Blu Ray especially for the quality to watch the end fight scene and Marvel Entertaiment cut it! They took out the part where Cap, Stark and The Winter Soldier battle it out with Cap's shield and it gives you chills. One of the best cinematic moments I had the pleasure of viewing twice. I assume they're going to scam us and relate it on extended cut when it was just part of not only the move I paid twice to see but shown in all the trailers. I'm returning mine and writing to Marvel about this. I feel I was bait and switched. I can only assume those who purchased theirs never saw this movie before or they didn't care enough about that fight scene.

That said, I found the story frustrating and predictable-it is entirely based on one man seeking revenge trying to tear them apart from the inside.  The analytical Iron Man and Vision suddenly turn incredibly dense and Captain America looks at them stony-faced instead of explaining what is going on.  Should have been better, but the special effects and actors are worth watching.

That is the best way to describe this release.
The film itself is fantastic, but as others have noted there is no digital copy. No DVD/Blu-ray combo pack option.

The only editions available are the ones pushing 3D as much as they can and a cheap, stripped down, basic Blu-ray version with only one disc, no digital copy, no slip cover, and a crappy little slim case.

It's not just the matter of a rather mediocre plot, or fight sequences that seemed to go on for several eternities. No. The real problem lies with the cast, who seem to have lost their cohesiveness. Perhaps it was the introduction of several new team members that interfered with the gelling process? I don't know, but the movie failed to maintain my interest.

7708872,5,B01D9EUNB4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

One thing about the movies being made from Marvel Comics: they know how to do them right. Almost all of the films based on DC Comics have done well at the box office but the Marvel films are leaps and bounds ahead of them. The biggest reason is that Marvel embraces the fact that these films are based on comics rather than toss them aside as if they don't matter. Fans recognize this. Marvel has taken the written word, the images from their comics and translated them to the screen without abandoning everything that made them special. Their newest release on DVD/Blu-ray, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, proves that.

Based on the series that enveloped all of their comics a few years back, the story focuses on a fearful world that wants to keep these super powered individuals in check. As the film opens a mission for the Avengers to prevent a deadly virus from being unleashed upon the world goes sideways, the end result being an explosion that collapses a building and results in casualties. Rather than note the number of lives that were saved by these heroes blame is laid at their doorstep rather than at that of the criminals they stopped.

After the mass amount of destruction that has happened during different battles in various other Marvel films involving the characters, the world has come together with the Sokovia Accords. This would require all heroes to sign off on supervision by the UN, an agreement that they would be the ones to decide where and when they would go and what missions they would become involved in.

This sets the heroes against one another. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) believes in the Accords. He is overwhelmed with guilt at the wake of destruction left in the paths of battles past. Captain America (Chris Evans) on the other hand recognizes that decisions need to be made by those involved in the battles, those who know firsthand what evil looks like, rather than in the hands of politicians whose motives change with the wind.

As the Accords are about to be signed the delegate from the African nations of Wakanda is speaking when a bomb explodes, killing him. Framed for the murder is Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Caps friend. The UN sends in team to capture Bucky but Cap gets there first to find out what is really going on. He helps him escape but a chase follows with not just the UN troops in pursuit but the new King of Wakanda, TChalla aka The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). All are eventually caught and it is while imprisoned that the real culprit reveals himself setting the stage for a battle royal between two teams of super heroes.

Iron Man has recruited those who feel the Accords must be followed: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and new recruit Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Cap has his own team in place with Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Winter Soldier and new recruit Ant Man (Paul Rudd). This result in a free for all that will have comic fans jumping with joy and action film fans watching in delight. And yet it is not the final battle and comes almost a full 30 minutes before the end of the film, a confrontation and revelation of why the whole thing has taken place.

It would be easy to discuss the effects here but be honest, you already knew theyd be mind boggling. With as huge a cast as is on display to pick out one performance above the rest isn't quite fair, but both Evans and Downey bring depth and emotion to both sides of the issue at hand. The real discussion about the film lies in the whole concept of the reason this civil war takes place.

One would think that after discovering the infiltration of top government officials in the previous Captain America film that all of the Avengers would hesitate signing off on the Accords. The guilt that Stark feels because of the deaths that result from the battles with bad guys develops into something that clouds his judgement and brings him to agree in them. Caps wisdom based on past experiences in both his current and past life know that you cant always trust in the people placed in power but you can trust the team members in whose hands you have placed your life.

In addition to that there are so many threads from most of the past films that are brought together here that to count them all would take too much time. Thats one of the most amazing things about the Marvel films. A single example is the rise of Gen. Ross (William Hurt) to Secretary of State, something that has happened in the course of 8 years from the release of THE INCREDIBLE HULK to this film. It means that all of the films combine together to make one huge storyjust like comic books do.

Ive loved all of the Marvel movies to date. The combination of old and new characters, of plotlines that are based in the actual comics and the superb direction, writing, editing and every other aspect of movie making that is on display here means that this is one movie that will receive multiple viewings at my house.

7708875,3,B01D9EUNB4,"A lot of people will compare this against Batman vs Superman. In my opinion the best moments of BvS are better than the best moments of Civil War. For better or worse BvS was decidedly aimed at adults with a darker, more dire cinematic climate. Civil War couldn't make up its mind who its audience was. While the airport brawl was downright juvenile, thanks to Spider-man and Ant-Man, the film also featured more cursing than all the previous Marvel films combined. And with all of Tony Stark's better-than-state-of-the-art technology, he had no idea the Sokovia Accords were coming? Big glitch her IMO.

Both films dealt with exactly the same issue. How does the government manage to control the super heroes to do their bidding - citing all the innocent collateral damage as their reason for reigning them all in. I would ask one question - ""with all the attacks from outer space, other dimensions and evil global organizations, would the world be better off if the super heroes had done nothing? I was shouting at the TV during both films for someone to ask this.

BvS had far superior cinematography, going so far as to suggest German expressionism in some landscapes. Winter Soldier might as well have been shot on videotape for all the cinematic nuance it displayed. I thought Ben Affleck's characterization of Batman was the most complex and believable of all the super heroes in both films. At the same time, Superman is a mannequin and there was way too much of anybody with the initials LL. In CAtWS I would have preferred that they made good on the suggested battle between the heroes and than platoon of other Winter Soldiers. I didn't believe that the Sokovian bad guy had the brains or resources to pull off what he did, like a half baked Bond villain.

Both films were entertaining but far from perfect.",1473811200,,1818,4.746835443037975

7708884,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War

What a time in American history (present) to unveil a film like this. Masked in shroud of a comic book movie, the movie truly tells a tale of people being ripped apart by legislation proposed by government sanctions over the people. This film is not about preserving freedoms from invaders from foreign lands or galaxies far far away. Instead it is fighting the terror that lurks beneath our very own skins.

So the question Captain America poses is when do we fight our fears of ourself with laws and government sanctions? His answer is when the people can not govern themselves. Iron Man's conscious and internal fears of what he has done and what he is capable of doing leads him to seek out such legislation. Create laws to govern and therefore the responsibility of the many can be turned away from the individual and given to the system that keeps the individuals in check.

With those being both sides of the argument, it is hard to not see a rift in a team, or a country, to not be far off. If we look at the social alignment today and how bipartisan legislation tears the fabric of ""the people"" the super hero allegory works on multiple levels.

The movie does a great job melding all 14 Marvel Movies that are present in the MCU, and opens doorways to future films. Black Panther and Spider-Man we're welcoming additions in Civil War as they both are sure to have promising solo franchises.

The Russo's did a great job choreographing the fight scenes, as well as pacing the film between those scenes. The tension builds very well as we also see the history of Winter Soldier program come to light. Lots of secrets are exposed from both sides developing each teams desire to win.

This does appear to be a third film in a trilogy to cap off a story Arc for ""the first Avenger"". If we look at the origin story, his first missions after being thawed and then taking his stand in Civil War. We see him mature from being the wimpy kid from Brooklyn, taking on neighborhood bullies to become a weapon against evil being aimed towards targets. It is when he begins to choose his own involvements and fights that he truly finds the freedom worth fighting for. He is fighting for freedom in an age where freedom is being voted away.

The film is well constructed and well acted. It does what Superman did in 1978, when it taught us a man could fly. I left believing we, as individuals can truly fight the battles in our lives we believe in. Whether we win or lose them, we need to stand up against all bullies, both foreign and domestic.",1473811200,4,2567,4.4957081545064375

If it's a minor thing, then why don't they use the name of their own fathers as swear words? Why not use their mother's names to cuss?  Here's an idea; why not say, Muhammad-dammit!  Or, Buddha-dammit! Alla-dammit! L. Ron Hubbard-dammit! What's in a name, anyway? This is the first I've noticed Marvel taking the Lord's Name in vain.  Use my suggestions, Marvel.  But of course, you're more afraid of the outrage that might come from people who still worship the dead, than you are from people who worship a living God, to whom we must give account.

I long suspected it was the result of some one very high up the food chain an low and behold it was none other than Kevin Feige himself who ordered this sacrilege.  Except, in the case of this movie, it wasn't.  Why the heroes were fighting each other made way more sense in the movie than it did in the comics, though there are still problems.

This is easily going a way the best of the five comic movies to come out this year and while none of the others including dawn of Justice were bad at all Civil War was a grand-slam out of the park home run.

The story was good and did a great job fitting everything into 2 hours of action and adventure. Captain America, the best Avenger ever! Iron Man added so much dimension to the film, there was no way they were going to fail. This is the one you want to watch, the one you want to buy and the one to want to see over and over again.

7709017,5,B01D9EUNB4,Pretty good.  I'm on the captain's side on this one.  Bucky seems to be the only friend that he grew up with in the entire world that is still around and battle ready.  He's a mentally programmed to do bad stuff when you say seven or eight words in order and he goes into command prompt mode.  You can't blame him for doing what he did in that mental state.,1473638400,,357,4.057142857142857

7709020,3,B01D9EUNB4,"I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart. After another attempt to save the world ends in destruction Steve (Evans) and Tony (Downey Jr.) are on opposite sides of what to do in the future. Tony feels that the superheros should not be given free reign, while Steve feels that they should be able to act as they see fit. When an old enemy surfaces allegiances are put to the test, and the end of the Avengers could be near. This is a movie that is basically review proof but Ill do one anyway. First of all, Ill say this is a good movie full of action, comedy and excitement, like all of the other Avengers movies. The big problem I have with this movie, like I have stated with all of the other movies in this series, is that it lacks real drama. By that I mean, because there is already the announcement of 2 more Avenger movies means that you know how it will end going in, this one had a chance to go dark and really change the game for this series, but once again, it got wrapped in a bow and left me feeling like this is just another in the line of movies made in order to make money and not offer drama. I liked Batman v Superman because of the drama. That movie did have major flaws, but because it ended with the death of a major character. Even though they are coming back for the next movie it set a precedent that makes you go into the next one wondering who won't make it out alive. Im not a big fan of comic book movies, but the ones I do like are dark, gritty, and makes you wonder what is going to happen. To me the Marvel movies dont. As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies. Overall, another in the line of the Avengers movies that people will love, I dont. I give this a B.",1473638400,3,1767,4.037037037037037

7709028,5,B01D9EUNB4,"As a guy who has loved comics for the last 6 years, this was one of the Marvel Movies I was the most excited to see. Ive longed to see our favorite superheroes battle it out on the big screen and the overly hyped airport fight scene did not disappoint. From surprises to twists and turn, it kept my attention and made the movie one of the best Ive ever seen.
But at the same time, the bromance between Captain America and his brainwashed friend Bucky (Winter Soldier) was irritating at points and obviously created the plot line but also caused me to say What? about a dozen times during the movie. The separation between the heroes over the accords to limit them on when to intervene was, in my opinion, overblown and forced just so we could have the huge airport screens, forcibly bring in other Marvel Universe character like Ant-Man, Black Panther, and the rebirth of Spiderman, and to help set up for other movies in the future which will force people like myself to come back and watch.
Like I said earlier though, I loved this movie and all the actors in it. Marvel has been a hot streak for a while now and they're going to ride this momentum as far as they can. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. as Captain America (Steve Rodgers) and Iron Man (Tony Stark) have always blown away their roles and have made audiences come back for more. The movie starts out beautifully with bringing in an old but temporary villain to kick start the movies plot and main conflict. As the movie progresses, we see the birth of a new villain within the Marvel Universe that we will begin to see now for years to come.
Overall, I gave this movie 5 stars because its one of the best comic book action movies Ive seen in a while, but it obviously has its flaws which some I couldn't overlook without mentioning. I say its a must see for anyone who is into comic book adaptations or flat out likes action movies in general.",1473638400,,1909,4.395480225988701

7709030,5,B01D9EUNB4,"A lot of action, but also a surprising amount of drama and character development in this movie. You can see their motivations clearly and even Cap  shows he's not perfect. Each character gets their little time to shine in the big battle, and what else can you say about Spider-Man? I go back-and-forth on whether or not this is my favorite Marvel movie, or even just one of my favorite movies in general. Check it out, MCU fan or not.

This one was one of the better films, and an exciting lead-in to the Infinity storyline. I'm quite concerned with the liberties the filmmakers take with the characters - who's in, who's out - with my biggest concern being that they won't include Adam Warlock in the Infinity series.

7709140,3,B01D9EUNB4,"OK- So the Avengers are literally at war with each other because Steve Rogers cannot forsake his childhood friend ""Bucky"". Granted, ""Bucky Barnes"" has been brain-washed by the Bad Guys--which renders him a loose canon ever-ready to wreak havoc on the forces of Truth, Justice and The American Way.

In the iconic Disney motion picture ""Old Yeller"", a 12-year old protagonist knows when the time has come for him to dispatch (as in, bullet in the head) his doggie best friend who has become incurably rabid. Obviously, Steve Rogers (AKA Captain America) either never saw this film--or never truly grew up.  A real hero knows when it is time to put aside personal feelings and act on the behalf of a greater good.

All this begs the question, ""Is Captain America a disciplined soldier ready to sacrifice everything for comrades and country--or an over-grown Boy Scout who refuses to follow orders?""

The Marvel franchise's formidable cast of actors known as ""The Avengers"" never get the opportunity to truly act, let alone inspire or entertain. They DO get to pose for silly one-liners and/or close-up reaction shots. All the rest consists of formidably edited action shots and CGI.

Stan Lee's noble band of Meta-powered misfits seem destined to flounder under the weight of their own moral and social responsibilities. Is it possible that a sexually frustrated kid from Queens can lighten their collective load? Stay tuned--because I have no easy answers.",1473465600,2,1455,5.045833333333333

Spiderboy (he's not a man yet in this) is a major distraction and is here just to make the Captain look stupid for a minute.  It's hard to believe so many folks liked this performance - maybe they just like his sarcasm and belittling of the other characters.  Of all the characters only Black Panther and Black widow acted like mature adults - the rest of the cast are usually engaged in school yard or juvenile bickering and fighting - just like Superman and Batman - thank goodness Lois Lane and Wonder woman were there to straighten everyone out.  Yikes . . . Captain America First Avenger is by far the best of the three movies - it is the most fun and made the most sense.  The last two are nearly joyless, depressing, violent and pointless.

There should be an option that if you buy the video it allows you to download the video in a format so that you can stream it in your home. I've never had an issue with doing it this way.

7709317,4,B01D9EUNB4,"This is a tough one to comment on but let me give it a try.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  I really wanted to give this 5 starts because it delivered what it was supposed to.  An affordable night at home with the family allowing everyone escape reality for a couple hours.  In the comfort of our own home I might add.  Looking at it that way, it deserves 5 stars easy.  Great special effects.  More dialog than normal, moral dilemma, questions of their own right to engage, disengage, and how collateral damage changes perspectives people have on them  those with gifts of special abilities.

Why 4 you might ask?  Well, Im sort of getting tired of the whole Bucky back story.  I do not follow the comics at all so I will be the first to say Im ignorant of the whole Marvel universe thing.  Ignorance is bliss so like I noted above I watch to escape reality and be entertained.  Nothing more.  But looking back on it I don't like the current trend of super hero movies  (both Marvell and DC) with their in-fighting.  Yes, egos get in the way Im sure and everyone has some evil intent, I get it, but it just seems rather, well, boring.  And back to Bucky it is clear that Captain has a personal attachment to him that can get into the way of his own moral compass and/or judgement.  Then we get into reboot material aka enter Spider Boy / Man.  Ant Man, Panther (interesting and I actually enjoyed him more than I expected, so great job).

There is some good acting.  Robert Downey Jr delivered has expected.  Don Cheadle deserved more time.  Others a bit short such as Renner (he has some potential).  Since this is getting long let me just say if you are looking for some action, good special effects, entertained, and escape reality  then this will deliver on all fronts and you won't be disappointed.",1473206400,,1802,4.371601208459214

I typically prefer to buy movies on Blu-ray so I approached this purchase with trepidation. There's something specific to movies and not any other kind of media that I feel compelled to buy them on disc. But I don't currently have a Blu-ray player because I just gave away my PS4 and I wanted to watch this movie so I decided to take the plunge into digital movie-buying.

Overall it's a fine experience on my Amazon Fire TV--the little box not the HDMI dongle.

Video quality: Totally fine. Probably not as nuanced and rich as a Blu-ray but not significantly worse than one either.

Audio quality: Totally fine. I only have a 2.1 soundbar anyways but dialogue was clear, explosions were explosive.

Stream quality: Good enough. I was surprised that the movie started playing immediately after clicking the buy button. I expected there to be some amount of caching of data upfront but there was none, that's pretty cool. And when the stream started it was at full quality immediately, no ramping up in quality from 480p to 1080p, also pretty cool. However, there were some hiccups where the audio stream would briefly cut out. I'm talking frames of audio so nothing significant enough to truly affect my ability to understand what was happening--also, it's a superhero movie it could be muted and you'd still know exactly what was happening and why.

My Fire TV is wired into my home network and my ISP regularly provides download speeds between 25 Mbps and 50 Mbps. I don't suspect that stream issues were related to my ISP or home network but something else on my end could still be at fault or contributing to those streaming issues.

Review of the movie:

Civil War is a lot of fun to watch. Taken on its own merits--as opposed to taking it within the context of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe and cannon--it is a good and solid movie that stands well on its own. Despite the fact that the events of the movie are set into motion ONLY through the events of all of the other Marvel movies Civil War still has its own center and it doesn't rely on or require that you've watched any other Marvel movies to get involved and interested. Although that certainly does help.

Tonally, it strikes the right balance between the utterly absurd and the deadly serious. The serious, political, content is satisfyingly grounded and feels sufficiently real in its approach. While the zany superhero stuff is appropriately fantastic, comedic, and hard-hitting when it needs to be.

Looking at the movie in the context of the rest of the MCU I'd rank this one up near the top. I love that this superhero team-up extravaganza is darker and more serious than its contemporaries. Civil War and the Avengers, for instance, could not be more different in that the Avengers is a bright and saturated movie that doesn't deal so much with the grey areas and underbelly of the superhero-ing business. Civil War deals entirely with that part of the business and I think that's interesting and valuable as a counterbalance in the grand scheme of things. Pound for pound, I'd still rank The Avengers at #1 with The Winter Soldier at #2 and Guardians of the Galaxy and Civil War duking it out for spots 3 and 4.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun romp that's more than just all the good guys punching all the bad guys. Id' recommend it for kids too, kids should be exposed to their favorite heroes disagreeing and fighting each other for what they believe in.",1473206400,10,3478,4.6759410801964

7709360,4,B01D9EUNB4,"My husband and I are big fans of the Marvel universe (he has successfully reeled me in).  The dynamic between Tony Stark and the Captain has always been pretty engaging, and in this film the two seem to be crossing over into the other's domain to a degree.  Captain A, typically the follow orders kind of guy is tipping into Iron Man territory; becoming somewhat removed from the powers that be.  While Stark strangely veers to the other side, encouraging the group to conform.  Amid this, and the return of the Captain's oldest friend, tensions run higher than ever before-and all Avengers must take a stance on one side or the other.  The group ends up breaking off into two interesting and unexpected groups.

Of course you have standard action, silly humor, and fun special effects in the mix.  Perhaps my favorite part of this purchase though, was in the bonus content.  There are some fun cast interviews, and the introduction of the upcoming Doctor Strange film (which I am now VERY super excited about!).  Great extra features in that bonus material.

7709372,4,B01D9EUNB4,"The biggest challenge for theMarvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been that the desire to include so many characters makes it harder to do so in a story that does all these compelling characters justice and doesn't sacrifice other elements of the movies. Civil War does surprisingly well giving face time to each of its heroes, really laying out the reason why some of these oddball heroes belong in a superhero group (sorry Hawkeye!) It does so in a way that is entertaining if unfortunately oversimplified.

The story suffers some, but not enough to hurt the whole thing. Civil War shines in so many ways, its easy to forgive its shortcomings.

Pros:
Black Widow showing that sisters are doing it for themselves
AntMan and SpiderMan provide some welcome humor to this team of individuals in a way that Tony Stark just can't manage anymore.
And speaking of SpiderMan- Tom Holland gives us the best on screen representation of the character we've followed in comics for 50 plus years, showcasing his brilliance, snark, and innocence like no one else has.

Cons:
A bit lacking in story cohesiveness
Boring villain

I am inclined to disagree with those who think that the moral argument of Chris Evans as captain America defending the traitor Bucky.. I am a 66 year old fan of Marvel comics. When I was a pre-teen back in the late 50's and early 60's, I used to wait on the corner of the drug store that sold comic books to wait for each issue of Marvel's Captain America, Spider Man, Iron Man, and The Hulk. Cap was the Marvel equivalent of Superman over at DC Comics, and had the same standard of good vs evil. He would have never done what this movie depicts. In essence becoming an evil doer, just to keep one friend alive and escape retribution for the obvious sins that he had committed. The premise is so spectacularly off-target that it is preposterous to have watched it during a Marvel sanctioned movie. Cap was the epitome of humility and servitude which is why he was hailed as hero, to servicemen of the Armed Forces and used as an example to inspired patriotism in the troops. I am appalled that the creator of the Marvel franchise, Stan Lee, let this movie be made in it's present form, thereby decimating the code that has been built up for Hero of the Marvel tradition for over 70 years. This movie had good action and CGI, but the storyline was a mixture of HellBoy and the X-Men movies that have already been made. Oh well, I never liked Chris Evans as an enlisted soldier who defiantly takes orders from no one, even those superior to his rank as being everything that Captain America was not. How many of those reading this review would have defended a person who had viciously killed another friends parents. I didn't think so...",1473033600,3,1769,4.412844036697248

Everything done in this movie i.e. plot, character development of old characters and even introduction of new such as Black Panther is done well. In fact it's hard to even say how it's done at all. As a hard core comic book fan I am immensely satisfied and as a movie goer I am entertained. I read the comic book and yes this movie is not the same, but I think it represented it well. And the villain, in my opinion is one of the best. I think it was refreshing to have a mastermind after having so many physically intimidating villains. The emotional level of this moving is staggering, you can really feel the intensity. And finally the way it ends. *spoilers* most movies hit the climax but it's always resolved, like in Batman vs. Superman. However the conflict isn't resolved, and the viewer is genuinely left wondering which side is right. A movie that gets you thinking like this is an elevated movie.",1473033600,5,1009,4.51912568306011

The only good thing to possibly come from this all is maybe U.N. now has to foot the bill for the Avengers operations.  Which, up until this point is still funded by Stark, since Shield fell apart.

The problem this movie has is the fact that the writers wrote themselves into a corner from the very start of the movie and had to hope XPLOSIONS would hide that from the audience.  You just said you wanted oversight for everything done .. and everything done from that point on has no oversight.  I am not talking about the stupid Winter Soldier story line that just needs to end.  I am talking about every time Team Iron Man suits up he breaks his own rules ... he didn't ask for any permission from any committee to do anything, he just does it ... .and then lambasts Team Cap for doing the exact same thing.

I do love how Stark says he is a non combatant and then pulls out a weapon not 30 seconds later.. or how Rhodes arrests Cap ... which he has no authority to do so ... but w/e ... who need logic....

On the plus side ... I did really like every scene the Black Panther and Spider Man were in and totally looking forward to his movie now.

Fun Fact 1:  The part of the movie where they try and justify their oversight plan with showing all the devastation the Avengers caused actually showed the opposite ... NY being attacked by (literally an act of God (Loki/Thor), Washington D.C. with Shield, then Age of Ultron (Starks fault) the island, and then the current event in Africa show a DRASTIC reduction in collateral damage.... Soooo as the Avengers go along they are doing less harm than good.

Fun Fact 2: Without the Stark's, none of this would of ever happened.  Between Tony and his Dad they have done more to end the world than anyone else on the planet ...  Even Vision points that gem out with his exponential statement.",1473033600,2,2407,4.2505494505494505

7709448,5,B01D9EUNB4,"I have collected all the recently released 'Marvel-Movies' ...enjoy the super-hero action and special-effects the presentations
bring to the screen....have enjoyed them all, though, for me, this is the ''best'' so-far.
Key Players -
Chris Evans - Captain America
Robert Downey Jnr - Iron-Man
Scarlett Johansson - The Black Widow
Sebastian Stan - Winter Soldier
Don Cheadle - War Machine
Jeremy Renner - Hawkeye
Paul Bettany - Vision
Elizabeth Olsen - Scarlet Witch
Emily VanCamp - Sharon Carter
Daniel Bruhl - Zemo
Frank Grillo - Crossbones
The Avengers are joined by three other Marvel-Heroes...(fans are probably aware of the characters, but for those who are not, i
won't spoil it)
The U.S Secretary of State informs the Avengers that the U.N are preparing pass the Sokovia Accords which will see a U.N panel
oversee and control the activity of the Avengers, whilst Tony Stark (Iron-Man) seemingly supports the proposal, Steve Rogers (
Captain America) does not.....something that causes a measure of friction between the two.
The tension between them will reach boiling-point when 'Captain America' in helping his friend and former colleague Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier) he appears to the U.S Agency and indeed 'Iron-Man' to have crossed the line, 'Iron-Man' is given 36 hours to br.ing
'Steve' in.
However, Captain America knows that the man, his friend that had committed the crime, is not the man he knows, and believes
Bucky's explanation, he also believes there to be a threat from 'Zemo' the U.S AuthoritIes and Iron-Man don't accept.
The split between Captain America and Iron-Man will see fellow avengers take sides threatening the very existence of the Super-Hero
alliance....they are at war - Civil-War
What will be the outcome, will the explanations heal the rift or will this spell the end for 'The Avengers' ???
Like earlier reviewers i have always loved this super-hero stuff and continue to do so....hopefully for many years to come (certainly there
are many more planned)
This, has all the action you could possibly wish for along with superb special-effects that pull you into this spectacular Marvel - Movie
A Must for Super-Hero Fans....

7709449,4,B01D9EUNB4,"As a long(I have titles that I purchased new on their release date in the '50s) time comic reader I like the movie and as others have said I really wanted to love but I can't. The entire premise doesn't fit the Marvel universe (in what universe does Stark sign a contract that allows the govt to tell him what he can do and where he can do it? A Stark that's that much a wuss would never have built an Ironman suit in the first place, he'd still be sitting in that cave waiting for ransom to be paid), the comic was the result of lazy writers who would have better served Marvel readers playing pocket pool.

The saving grace for the movie is the great action and the great casting of the characters that make me want to watch them. It's well worth watching if you can get past the premise or can buy into the premise.",1473033600,2,818,4.144654088050315

7709451,2,B01D9EUNB4,"It has the parts to be a really good movie, but you can't ignore the glaringly obvious flaw; the one that ruins the suspension of disbelief.

They try to force the idea that that both sides of the debate are equally justified for their actions. It simply is not true, and the storytelling shows it.

I watch the movie and can't stop thinking, ""That makes no sense; no one would be fighting.""  And that's what the whole movie is about.

At least it was not like the comic version of it; they turned beloved characters into monsters and murderers.

I did not give this a one star because I did not hate the movie; I just don't like it. It has all of the pieces to be a good movie, but the reason for fighting was so poorly constructed that I can't accept it as a good movie. Especially because it would have been so easy to make a good movie out of it. That is the real reason I can't even give it a 3 stars. I honestly want to like the movie; I like most of the characters and the actors/actresses playing them. The heroes themselves are cool. Even Captain America's side of the story is good. But even that good bit of story is made meaningless because there is no reason he should be fighting, and that just ruins the whole dang movie.",1473033600,3,1236,4.220338983050848

Tony Stark's sarcasm plays much better off of Steve Rogers then just some random bad guy.  I was hoping they'd used this as an opportunity to murder Hawkeye (spoiler alert) but we can't have everything.  Black Panther is a great addition to the MCU.  You'd better be an awesome actor if you are King and dress like a cat.  So far the Russo movies have been the boldest both in story and action.  They even managed to redeem Spiderman.  Unfortunately the ""meh"" movies of the MCU always make the most money.  Guess which direction Disney's going to go for the MCU's future?",1472947200,3,718,4.371212121212121

7709461,3,B01D9EUNB4,"I liked the movie, but I wanted to love it. Unfortunately, it's not the case. I'm going to make this brief. As a fan of the comic, the only similarity is that they pass a law, and Iron Man and Cap assemble two tiny teams that have more of a Civil Skirmish than an actual war. They did the same thing in Iron Man 3 when they dumbed down the fantastic Extremis story line, the best ever for Iron Man since his origin story, and served up a watered down experience. Here we go again. It's entertaining, but not very good. I'll probably never watch it again, and I really wish I had just rented it, to be honest.

7709530,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Really, really enjoyed this movie. In fact, I saw it in the theater multiple times and bought this as soon as I realized it was out. As a Captain America fan I'm a little disappointed that Civil War was the story they went with for Cap's third installment, but the Russos and Markus and McFeely did a great job with the story they had to work with. And actually, I'd hazard to say, did a better job of balancing the sides then the comics did. When I read the comics I was very, very firmly team Cap, considering those who supported the SHRA threw people into the negative zone without trial, denied them medical care, threw bombs at buildings unregistered superpowered beings were hiding in, taking them by surprise, created a clone of Thor without Thor being aware Stark has a sample of his DNA, that clone was unstable and actually killed a man, set a group of known criminals and murderers loose to hunt down unregistered superheroes, almost killing Spider-Man, and before the SHRA had even passed SHIELD asked Cap to hunt down those who refused to register and he told them no, that he wouldn't hunt down his friends and they open fired on him! That is how he came to lead the anti-registration side, and that is why I couldn't fathom how ANYONE would be on the side supporting the SHRA. Especially when the heroes were not even given the choice to sign or not, they signed or they were imprisoned, essentially segregated them from the rest of the population and denying them their humanity.

In the movie I'm still firmly Team Cap, I went in Team Cap, and left Team Cap but at least the movie did make Iron Man's side more sympathetic. I understood why he was motivated to do the things he did, even while I didn't agree with some of his actions. And at the end, of course, without giving away a major spoiler, my heart did break for him. If we're basing affiliation just on the Accords without considering the emotional baggage both Steve and Tony were carrying with them, I'm still rather firmly in the 'no on the Accords' camp. The fact that they laughed at Steve when he asked if Bucky was going to get a fair trail was one reason for my mistrust of the Accords. That the 'shoot on sight' order was placed on Bucky to begin with was another. That Ross, even after given empirical evidence that Bucky had not committed the UN bombings was still so determined to chase him and Steve down was a third. Frankly, knowing Ross the way we do, that man should be in prison for his actions in Incredible Hulk, not chastising others for 'collateral damage'. But my main driving force for not supporting the Accords is the fact that they Avengers don't exist in the real world. In their world aliens attack without warning and do not respect international borders when they do it. I don't think the Avengers should have to wait for a committee to decide for them to spring to action when every second they wait could result in more death. I also get rather profound amusement with the 117 countries backed the Accords thing. Uh, ri-ight. Knowing how the UN Security Council works, with the US, the UK, France, China and Russia having absolute veto power, its more like these five countries wanted the Accords and everyone else better damn well agree or they risk a diplomatic relations nightmare. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Ross, as Secretary of State, reached out to King TChaka, after the Lagos incident to sort manipulate Wakanda into spearheading the Accords. Using the UN in this movie was, perhaps, not the brightest move, because, you know, the audience would need to have actual respect for the UN for the plot to work. Be that as it may, still a good story. The character beats were what made it gel and for that there are plenty.",1472860800,5,3746,4.541420118343195

(Yes, I realize his character feels the guilt of the Ultron disaster.)  Is the story set up so suddenly the world needs the Avengers again and those imprisoned tell them where to go?  It's like the Earth wants to be saved when confronted, but those who go to the mat to do the saving become a problem when the mission is over because it didn't turn out like the ""armchair"" Generals want it.  Ok, I am probably overthinking it - but maybe it is a little too close to some of aspects in life right now.  The film itself was good - but the story was disturbing for me.",1472774400,4,744,4.174825174825175

7709537,3,B01D9EUNB4,"There were just too many holes in the plot, and too many instances of heroes acting out of character.  I came away genuinely disappointed in this movie, after entering the theater so excited - Civil War is my favorite comic story line and to see this movie adaptation in MCU was a big downer.  I don't want to spoil things, but even the big fight had a glaring flaw that ruined it for me.  There was no real loss, no lesson learned in the end.  Spiderman was a definite highlight, but again, don't spend too much thought on the circumstances of him getting pulled in!

I digress - the movie is fun as long as you don't think about why anything is happening.  If you want a richer story read the comic.

7709539,3,B01D9EUNB4,"An entertaining movie, no doubt, but drops the ball at many points. With shoe horned fan service, the movie will entertain you, but won't make you think. And if it does, the movie starts to fall apart.",1472601600,,201,4.45945945945946
7709540,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Now that we have all these superheroes in the Marvel universe, let the squabbling begin.  Ideological and temperamental differences between Iron Man and Captain America, heavily alluded to in Captain America: Winter Soldier, come to a boil.

The team has now had a few years of globe-trotting and world-saving missions, one city-smashing event at a time.  There are human consequences to the large-scale destruction wrought by the best intentions of saving the world, and a squadron of powerful beings with unchecked power and no national allegiances has the worlds governments clamoring for oversight.  The United Nations wants control over these weapons of mass destruction.

The Russo Brothers have this down.  As in their Marvel directorial debut, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, they deftly handle multiple characters and a labyrinthine plot, giving each character a moment here, a beat there, that gives the viewer a sense of individual growth yet retains the collective.  The focus remains solidly on our title hero, now less a man-out-of-time than a man struggling between loyalty to his country or to his friend (Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed Winter Soldier).  Chris Evans has matured perfectly into the role of Steve Rogers, giving him surprising levels of nuance in a character who must strike a tricky balance between freedom and responsibility.  As Bucky, Sebastian Stan does a nice job playing a guy whos just woken up from a long, bad dream.

Civil War can rightfully be seen as another Avengers movie, with all Avengers present except for Thor and Hulk.  When a mission in Nigeria to hunt down a terrorist cell (led by Frank Grillos mecha-suited Crossbones) goes terribly wrong and causes civilian casualties, the group is pressed by General Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from the last Hulk film) to accept the UNs Sokovia Accords contract; if they sign, they give up their identities and must answer to a governing body before taking any action.  A guilt-ridden Tony Stark, still reeling from the damage wrought by his Ultron creation, is in favor, but Captain America isn't buying it.  The team divides.  Assumedly, Team Iron Man goes off registering superheroes while Team Cap goes into hiding as fugitives, harboring the most-wanted Winter Soldier.  But of course, someone is still pulling some evil strings, the most heinous of which may be The Visions sudden fashion sense for slacks and sweaters (Paul Bettanys take on the power-wielding android is spot-on; he can go from humor to touching to reminding us why he alone holds the mindstone gem).

The villains string-pulling is the main weakness here.  Outside of Tom Hiddlestons brilliant Loki, Marvel comes up short in layered and compelling antagonists (though David Tennants creepy take on Kilgrave in Netflixs Jessica Jones series was exciting); Daniel Bruhls Baron Zemo is merely human, hatching a complex plot to frame Bucky for the murder of a diplomat, in order to gain top-secret info on a certain assassination job hed performed decades before as The Winter Soldier, the reveal of which hes banking will turn the Avengers against each other.  His actions later (why revive a squadron of super soldiers if you're only going to do that thing to them?) are a big head-scratch.

The other weakness is the motivation for stockpiling more superheroes; Black Panthers presence is fully grounded in the films plot and location, and sets up King TChallas origin nicely; Chadwick Boseman is in command as the Wakandan prince-turned-king, and hes exciting to watch in action.  But it seems unlikely that either Tony Stark or Steve Rogers would bring even more untested superheroes into a battle with zero exposition on why they should be fighting.  Spider Man and Ant Man just show up as if duty bound, no questions asked, and jump into battle.  I would like to have seen just a moment with each weighing their feelings regarding the Sokovia Accords; in the comics, Spider Man has a much bigger role, and more at stake, in the Civil War story.  Hes shoe-horned in here; its wonderful to see him, Tom Holland is fresh and gives the role vital young energy and even realism (and Marisa Tomeis new Aunt May is hot); but its clearly just a holy crap, we got Spider Man in the movie excitement; once the grand battle is over, Spidey is quickly dismissed and its back to the core conflict between Tony and Steve.

Finally, because its all just so much fun and not ham-handedly overdramatic, most critics probably won't be pondering the fact that Civil War suffers from the same fundamental flaw as Batman vs Superman; an over-hyped battle that never needed to happen if characters played out according to their true natures.  The brilliance of the premise is that both sides are valid; but they would all know that an airport-razing brawl would only dramatically underscore and prove valid societys fear of their unchecked power.  But the big brawl is why we came to the show, and the battles don't disappoint; it seems every hero gets a moment to face off against every other.  Its a whiplash sequence, but cleverly choreographed and injected with plenty of humor and menace.  Its the tentpole upon which the movie hangs, and its a giddy delight, even when we know the heroes are pulling punches and still engaged in more camaraderie than outright rivalry.

There is a surprising decision made at the end, regarding the fate of the Winter Soldier, that might ring a bit hollow for some; it did for me.  I won't say more as it would provide spoilers. Captain America: Civil War doesnt quite transcend the genre as its predecessor did, but its an upper-tier entry in Marvels serialized universe.

CLICHES:  Superhero.  More superhero. Repeat.
SURPRISES:  One glaring character omission, given the cast list, is Samuel Jacksons now-rogue leader, Nick Fury; he would most certainly have shown up with a wise nugget or two, given the stakes for the team he put together.

Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after the second trailer or whatever!

Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.

Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10

Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin in the series. 8/10

Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING. You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever. 20/10.

Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually one of the few that are in there.

Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better. Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well, but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and good instead of good and evil.",1471305600,3,2621,4.4365904365904365

Really, the only issues I had were

1) The ridiculous plan and all of the crazy variables that had to be in place for the bad guy's plan to come to fruition and
2) In reality (the reality of the MCU), this plot never would have happened. Tony and Cap would have talked it out, looked at the facts, and laughed about it. But that doesn't build conflict, so a bunch of characters made some stupid decisions.

And both of those points are issues in any movie, especially movies that take place in a world where Super heroes are a real thing.

7709559,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War (or Avengers 2.5 as many are keen to calling it) revolves around an internal conflict within the group of Avengers. The main plot line revolves around Captain America trying to prove his friends innocence in the face of seemingly irrefutable evidence. Although the trailers made the accords to be a large part of the story line it really is a secondary plot compared to the main conflict I mentioned earlier.

Pros-
Action scenes are superb and the effects are some of the best that Mervel has published to date.
The main characters are relatable and have very strong motivations.
The new characters are exceptional and really help to drive the conflict forward.
The third act is very unique compared to other Marvel movies and really shakes things up.
The villain is awesome.

Neutrals-
A couple side characters seem to appear and disappear very quickly. Although these characters have some of the best moments in the film it could be argued there is not much reason for them to be there in the first place.
This movie focuses a lot more on Iron Man than someone would expect from a Captain America film.

Cons-
There are a couple minor plot holes, mainly involving Vision, which make things seem off at times. These can be explained away but they could be distracting for someone who watches the film critically.
Crossbones is underutilized in my opinion.

Overall I think Civil War is one of the strongest Marvel films to date. The new characters are very faithful to the comics and the story still has everything you could expect from a Marvel movie.

On another random note Batman v Superman has nothing on this and it is laughable to suggest it is better like some of these reviews have (Man of Steel is my favorite movie too so I wanted it to be good, but it's just not).",1470009600,2,1805,4.663522012578617

There are just so many (and so many with the same characters) that they run out of reasonable story lines after a while. I did enjoy this one though. They tried to shake it up by having the heroes fight one another. Some liked it and some hated it.

7709562,2,B01D9EUNB4,"More like ""Iron Man: Civil War"" than Captain America. All the many fight scenes were fun to watch but it was the weird things that brought it down for me, like why Spiderman comes out of nowhere then disappears, why Black Panther, a relatively new 'hero', can beat the absolute crap out of battle hardened master assassin Bucky and soldier Captain America (and on top of that why Bucky lost almost every fight he was in in this movie despite being a killing machine in Winter Soldier), and the ending having that definite ""oh crap we forgot to make an ending"" feel. Then there's the entire plot basically revolving around Iron Man being a whiny baby with almost no character advancement to Captain America or Bucky.

On a whole it fits the normal Marvel style, nothing is taken too seriously and the costumes and fights look amazing. The battle between the two heroes was fun to watch even though we all knew what the outcome would be, but it doesn't live up to Winter Soldier and is unfortunately on the list of Marvel movies I don't like, which currently is every movie but the first two Captain America's. I try to rely on Captain America to keep me into the Marvel movie universe but this one didn't do a good job to make me like anybody but Captain America, even if he was so little involved in this film.",1469750400,7,1310,4.481171548117155

Does it have plot holes? Yes. Is the fact that most of the Avengers and then some are in a Captain America movie? Yes. But the characters, action, emotions and overall fun factor almost completely negate these flaws. I felt stakes not because of who I felt was going to die, but because of the fact that these friends have been ripped apart through vengeance and hatred.

7709564,5,B01D9EUNB4,"The Best Marvel movie yet! Civil War has a lot of characters in it, but what makes it work is that they have already been developed due to previous movies. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is a freakin BADASS! He did not skip leg day if you know what I mean. I cannot wait to see his movie, and I was so happy when it was confirmed that Ryan Coogler who directed Fruitvale Station and Creed will be directing the movie. As for Spiderman... well... he is the best Spiderman ever put on screen. I have never been more excited for a single superhero movie in my life. Tobey Maguire was great, but he was sort of a different kind of spiderman than whats in the comics. As for Andrew Garfield, I liked him overall, but I couldn't take him seriously as a nerd, due to the fact that he's good looking, dresses nice, rides a skateboard and breaks school rules. But Tom Holland nailed the character in every aspect. Spiderman is suppost to be a complete nerd and says hilarious lines, and that is what Tom Holland did! But what really makes Civil War unique compared to all the other Marvel movies is that the story is not like any of the others. It has a lot to do with a lot of political aspects and both Captain America's side and Iron Man's side bring up a lot of great points and you may find yourself switching sides a lot. As for me I'm team Iron Man for the most due to one of the points that I think Vision brings up, and that the more people with powers and the more people from other worlds that come (such as Thor), the more trouble that comes. Let's be honest, If Thor never came to earth, Loki and Malikeith (probably spelt it wrong), would have never cause any trouble. But despite the fact that I agree with most of the points team Iron Man made, Captain America also brought up some points that I agree with. Marvel has a hard time with their villains, but I really liked Baron Zemo, because he is not like any villain we have ever had. He doesn't have any superpowers, he doesn't know how to fight. He uses the political tensions to his advantage to tear the Avengers apart. When I watched this time went by so fast no joke. All the action scenes are awesome, and the airport battle is literally the best superhero fight ever put on screen. I'm not going to talk much about the action because it's hard for me to do that without spoiling anything. All in all, I couldn't find anything wrong with Civil War except for the shaky cam on Black Widows fights at the beginning of the movie. But that doesn't take away from what the rest of this movie had to offer and my final rating for this movie is a 10/10! Oh, and DC and Warner Bros, you better go see this movie and take some notes!",1469232000,2,2692,4.249512670565302

7709566,5,B01D9EUNB4,"I walked in very dubious, was it going to be Avengers 2.5? Was it going to be a bombardment of unnecessary characters all struggling for screen time, was Robert Downey Jr going to take over the film? The answer to a couple of those questions was yes. But it worked, and it worked really well for me.

Ill start with what i thought the negatives were.

Baron Zemo, the main baddie of the piece, is rather un-intimidating and although his plan goes off without a hitch, you don't feel, that he's actually capable of doing what we see him do, yes he's got the motive, but from what I could gather he had next to no resources and next to no history with Hydra to set up the scenarios he did. Unless i missed something. I will also give a shout out to the fan-boys that will probably be annoyed that he's not portrayed anything like he is in the comics, not being a Marvel reader myself I didn't find this as a negative but i understand how disappointing it can be when your excited to see a character you love on the big screen and then you go and watch a completely different character using the character you wanted to see's name. *cough cough DC*. I think Crossbones from the beginning of the film made a much more convincing bad guy, and would have had the resources, man power and motive to orchestrate the same things Zemo did.

Robert Downey Junior, I was worried he would try and hog the limelight, and he kind of did, this was a Captain America and Iron Man film, centring on both equally. Now while this worked and the film was still amazing, I was hoping for a repeat of The Winter Soldier type cinematic feel, and while there are still a lot of political and super spy elements in the film we see less of Cap in place of Tony as they both build there teams and battle with there consciousness and follow their own heavily intertwined story lines. As i said, this is still an amazing film, but I think it should have been called Captain America Vs Iron Man: Civil War, he is so prominent through out its just as much his film as it is Captain Americas.

Spider-Man, now this has positives and negatives, i was worried Spider-Man would come across as an after thought, seeing as... well he was an after thought because they didn't know if they could use the character or not. The Negative was, that he definitely did appear as an after thought to me, he plays a very minor role and this movie only feels like a brief introduction for the character, i was hoping for a deeper more involved role instead of just skirting the outer rims of the plot, which hes not involved in. I know because they didn't know if they could use Spider-man they replaced his role in the storyline with Black Panther in the original script and anyone that has even read a Wikipedia entry on Civil War comic book will notice that its definitely the case in this film, as Black Panther takes on the role of learning to look at things properly before making decisions in place of Spider-Man, which was a shame because I would have loved to see more Spider-Man.

Positives:

Spider-Man, i thoroughly enjoyed the scenes we got to see him in suit, young, inexperienced, out of his league, yet cocky this is the most fun and lively Spider-Man we've had so far, the Last Spider-Man was a bit cringey for me, seeing as he looked older than he was acting, but here we have a young, energetic Spider-Man who's funny, witty and mouthy, his fight scenes are among some of the best and despite being on team Stark you get the impression that his being led by an idol and could have had such a bigger part in the film, developing as he does in the book before residing with Captain America. He felt like an underused after thought in what could have been a defining welcome to the MCU moment. This is all early days yet, but i am thoroughly looking forward to Spider-Mans solo entry next year.

The Avengers all fit in nicely here, with Thor and Hulk missing the rest of the team all gathers to fight each other, and as I mentioned earlier i was worried it would be a case of too many cooks, but it wasn't. it worked. Each character had its place and time, the characters that only needed small parts only had small parts and characters that needed to be felt more prominently like Black Panther and Black Widow had just the right amount of screen time and involvement. This juggling act runs smoothly and wonderfully as we don't get Hawkeye shoved down our throat at every turn like we did in Age of Ultron. We also get to see some great action and comedy scenes between the backseat cast, whether its a heart felt, thought provoking moment between Vision and Scarlett Witch or a comedic exchange between Ant-Man and ...well everyone. All characters get their little gems in the film without smothering the audience which i imagine is a very difficult thing to do when dealing with such a large cast of independent and powerful characters.

Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross makes his triumphant return, seeing as the entire cast of the Incredible Hulk film have been alienated since his one solo outing, it was great to bring it back into recognition with the return of this character. After health issues he's slightly calmed down since the Incredible Hulk and has gone from General to a cosier Secretary of State job. Although he may approach things a little calmer than when we last saw him, make no mistake, he still has the same mistrust of power and craves to imprison, control and contain it under his own guise. He does a fantastic job of taking on the Avengers and the only thing I was slightly disappointed about was that he barely mentioned the Hulk. He asks where Thor and Hulk is and we get no other reference to their previous connection. Even a subtle nod like a built for purpose Hulk-prison in the background of one of his scenes would have been great.

Black Panther, Marvels answer to Batman, kind of, makes his debut here, a strong, cool and collect character that definitely plays an important part in the film in respective of the future of Marvel, with the introduction of the Black Panther enemy Ulysses Klaw in the Age of Ultron, the pieces are all on the board now for a solo film, even more so as we learn about the characters background and heritage throughout the film. Although I would have preferred to see Spider-Man take a more prominent role I am glad Black Panther was the one too replace his featured role (Instead of someone like Hawkeye or Scarlett Witch).

The dynamic between Captain America, Iron Man and the Winter Soldier are brilliant, with a boiling pot type of relationship, you feel tensions rise and rise throughout the film, until eventually just when you think things might work out the pot explodes. Every scene the characters are in, just work and the interaction between the entire cast really shows heart. With consequences being felt by a lot of the characters by the end of the film, the upcoming Marvel films have a lot to deal with and have a lot of directions they could go.

Overall a very strong entry, while it isn't perfect I feel it definitely deserves five stars because I did love it and I wanted to see more. DC and Snyder please take note, this is how you do a cross over and expand a cinematic universe, not a mis mash of cringey cameos and blunt, simplistic writing which jams as many boring one dimensional characters into an even more boring, one dimensional and plot holed scenario.
Also a brief mention about Daredevil, who i was hoping would get a cameo or a nod of some sort, he doesn't. Which while it is disappointing after seeing the film I don't see how they could have included him, without diminishing his character in some aspect. I definitely recommend this film but can see that some die-hard fan-boys will find more faults than me. But as a viewer with little Marvel comics experience i thoroughly enjoy the film for what it was.",1469145600,3,7879,4.49895178197065

It's kinda like when you meet someone who is stunning but you have no chemistry with them, but you want to, but it just isn't there, but you still think they're beautiful and you still dig them, but you know you'll never fall in love and have babies, but you'd let them use you for physical pleasure...

It's a cool and slick movie but it bored me some ways.  It had some really serious and dark moments which I liked.  It was cool to finally see Spiderman and his wise cracking didn't bother me with this movie because he is still a kid and that's part of his character.  But if they recast Spiderman one more time I think i'm gonna loose my mind... but I guess it's just what happens in movies.  Anyhow I liked that there was conflict and that the Avengers get disassembled.  Finally Black Panther makes it to the big screen!  Real people have died waiting for Black Panther to hit the screen.  Thumbs up on that. All very cool stuff.

And here comes the but...  But I didn't dig it that much.  It was good but not Winter Soldier good but better than Age of Ultron in my opinion.  And how is it that you have all of these heroes fighting and no Nick Fury.  Where is Nick at in the midsts of all this.  Not even a Skype call?  No cameo for Daredevil?  No opportunity for any other tv based SHIELD agents to make an appearance?  Marvel missed a huge opportunity to strengthen the connection with all of their shows and movies.  Maybe we'll see better connectivity in Avengers Infinity War I & II.  The other thing that bugs me is that they manage to fight in a ""completely empty"" airport... I know it was evacuated but we see no b-roll of people being ushered out of the way.  Or flights being diverted or accidentally landing anyway during the battle and getting a wing torn off.  I know people rave about that fight scene but I thought it was too empty.  There was no risk.  As I stated in my recent X-Men review, the movie makers have to stop bowing down to people who cry about imaginary destruction and danger to imaginary people on screen.  ""It's a made up story people... get a hold of yourselves.""  It's funny because I never hear people talk about how many people die in LOTR.

Anyhow I'll watch again because I love Super Hero / Sci Fi movies.  But I still liked BVS more.  I'm giving it a 3.5.  I really wish they had half points on this site.

Anyhow, you'll dig this if you liked Avengers, Iron Man, Blade, Daredevil (Netflix), Jessica Jones (Netflix), Captain America I&II, X-Men.",1468022400,7,2551,4.341101694915254

7709585,3,B01D9EUNB4,"Its happened: our heroes have turned against one another. Just the image above proves what the Avengers have come to: turning on one another in a state of civil war over their limit to government control. No more fun and gamesits time to really challenge what they stand for.

Ill admit that I don't care too much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Theyre fun, but nothing about them resonates too deeply. But now, Captain America: Civil War has become one of the better of the movies within the trope. Its packed with the excitement, twists, fun, and laughter that we all expect from Marvel at this point. While it isn't worth multiple viewings, it is worthwhile for the teens, as theres more under that shiny armor than what meets the eye.

Based on the 2007 Civil War comic books, this third addition to Captain Americas misadventures turns him into a criminal that the nation has lost its hope in. Its similar to Batman v. Superman, except done right. The Avengers now find themselves in a public media predicament after a mishap in a Lagos chemical heist ends with several people dying thanks to them. Now, the government decides to let the United Nations Panel instruct the super team. Looks like Captain America now has to clear his name not only with the politicians, but his own close friends and teammates.

Minus Hulk and Thor, all the heroes you know and love are back in action: Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Mass Destruction, Hawkeye, Falcon, and Ant-Man, plus some new faces as well: the smoothly cunning Black Panther and your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man. Now let me tell you, its the webslingers third reboot within a decade, and at last they got the character right! Within the first 10 seconds, you will instantly say to yourself, Yes! Tom Holland was born to be Peter Parker! And Spider-Man! His backstory is also smartly left out. After all, we already know it as this point, right? The rest of the heroes also have their share of some great laughs, Vision in particular, and they always seem to have tons of fun with each other on set. But I have one complaint though: its the same old shtick weve always seen. Weve got a super talented cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, and they're doing the same thing weve always seen them do. Its not them thats the problem, its the two directors, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo. They just don't know how to stage actors while getting worthwhile performances.

There are some cool decision that these two make in continuing the series, and some not so cool. With the action scenes, its impossible to tell whether if they're awesome or pathetic.

But first, the good stuff: a garbage truck breaks down the arch in front of a medical center, Johansson totally rocks in combat action, theres a tunnel chase, Captain America holds down an entire helicopter by himself, the Avengers fight one another in one of the best moments of the entire movie series, and one hero has a big surprise that I cannot mention out of fear of spoiling anything.

Now, the bad stuff: Its hard to see the action because of the sped up footage and shaky camera (you know what Im talking about), the editing is monstrous, characters who needed backstories didn't get one, the VFX looks fake a lot of the time, Black Panther appears out of nowhere and at an unbelievably convenient time, and there is too much talking that takes away the tension.

So therefore, the action is neither awesome nor pathetic. Its awesomely pathetic. Or is that pathetically awesome? Nah, Ill go with the first option.

What I love right now about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how every hero has his own story to tell. What makes it better is how this series makes that concept work so well, almost like its the narrative of television marrying the narrative of film! I also like how it points out the issue of heroes creating mass destruction and putting the people in danger, possibly out of reaction towards Man of Steel. Although I probably couldve done with a shorter film and a clearer plot, its neat to see how all the subplots come together in the end.

But you know what else? We can learn a lot about ourselves from the Avengers. Its already clear that were a divided nation, so its just incredible how Marvel can take these abstract conditions of our country and simplify them. The Marvel Cinematic Universe may not produce all around perfect films, but it knows how to get the youth of the country out of our state of civil war.

The action was fantastically choreographed, the producers did an amazing job balancing all of the characters set to appear on screen and successfully cashed in on the character development of several prior films.  I am a huge Black Panther fan and he was presented so well I couldn't have imagined it any better.  I also love what they did with Spiderman.

No, its not up to the level that Captain America 2 Winter Soldier is, but that, to me is the best of the Marvel movies out so far so its not its fault! This one did drone on at periods with unnecessary dialogue so you get bored at times over the 2.5 hours of it, but then they pick it up and draw you back in, and threw a few new details from the past at you to keep you interested when action scenes weren't going on. Great main fight scene between all of the characters; fun hearing the Avengers trash talking throughout to keep it somewhat lighthearted. It was also great being introduced to new characters that will be coming out in their own movies in the future like Spider Man (yes, I know, we're on the 3rd actor portraying Spidey now), and Black Panther. Not to mention seeing the new characters like Ant Man and Scarlet Witch back in this one, so really this felt more like an Avengers movie instead of a Captain America title since the only 3 Avengers that were missing from this were Thor, Nick Fury, and Hulk. The villain is built up throughout and then you're left thinking, ""eh"" with a shrug when you find out the reason for his motive. I didn't pick a side between Captain and Iron Man, I see where both sides are coming from and find it an unnecessary argument to start the movie off with to be honest, it felt forced between the characters, just to have an argument to pin them against each other, but overall a pretty good movie, full of action scenes right from the beginning!",1465689600,,1609,4.31023102310231
7709593,5,B01D9EUNB4,"One of the best, if not the best, superhero films I have seen. Great action, but I also though it had a great story. I watched it with my young daughter and we have subsequently had some very interesting discussions on good v bad / right v wrong as most of the main characters in this movie have valid reasons for taking the sides they did, but it shows that there can be situations in life where ""good"" people can have completely different perspectives which sometimes leads them into conflict.

7709595,4,B01D9EUNB4,"It's a good movie for what it's supposed to be, but not for a comic book movie. In my opinion, this movie should been a Captain America, and Bucky movie. Then, have the events in the movie lead up to Civil War. This movie is basically just about Bucky, whereas Civil War wasn't. I did like the attention to detail they had for this movie though. For example, Black Panther did not make any noise whatsoever when running, jumping, landing, fighting, etc... This movie is also lacking a lot of backstory. It would have been better if they released a Spider-Man, and Black Panther movie separately before releasing this. It could be pretty confusing to a lot of people who don't know Black Panther, or that this Spider-Man is totally different than the 2 previous big screen versions. Overall, it was funny, had superb action scenes, and I loved watching it. I just wish they separated the feud between Cap and Tony, and Cap with Bucky.",1464825600,4,933,4.626506024096385

7709597,3,B01D9EUNB4,"The whole movie is based on one simple premise -loss of loved ones leads one to seek blind justice. Thus every character in the Marvel Universe, good or bad, acts on this premise as they're ALL based on a tragedy happening to a person dear to them (tell me one character thats not built on tragedy if you can). Now if you accept that fact than everyone in this universe basically acts stupid and the same so eventually the whole plot fars apart and becomes redundant. Yes, the special effects are fabulous and the actions scenes well choregraphed but it's all meaningless because every character in this universe behaves according to the same rule - seeking justice for a personal tragedy. It boils down to seen one, seen it all. By the way, the final fight between Cap and Iron is based on the most ludicrous excuse of Iron not knowing how his parents died while Cap knew all along ( and by that logic extension, most of American Intelligence, except Iron Man).

7709598,3,B01D9EUNB4,"See, the thing about the Avengers movies is that they're great on the action and especially the special effects, but the plotline is usually moronic. In this particular installment, it starts out more intelligently than usual. It has finally come to the attention of the authorities that when the Avengers go into action against the bad guys, they carry out as much damage and mayhem as the bad guys, and there is usually a big loss of lives. So the countries of the world have demanded that they submit to a central authority which will give the green light to operations within certain parameters. The Avengers are divided in this, with Iron Man heading those in favor and Captain America against. Unfortunately, the plot quickly degenerates into mediocrity revolving around a third party looking for vengeance and the climax is particularly stupid.

One particularly bright spot is Spiderman's participation in the battle and that alone is worth seeing the movie.",1464480000,5,966,5.0375

7709601,3,B01D9EUNB4,"(warning this review will have a few spoilers don't let that stop you from reading the review or seeing the movie)
This movie is a good action adventure flick, with a good story line, action scenes, and some introduction of new characters and content. Is it the ""Civil War"" of the comics books? Not Really. The original comics focus on the government passing the ""mutant registration act"" a law that make it illegal for ""mutants/super heroes"" to act/live with out registering with the government. ( a life and liberty plot line) This movie changes the focal point of the story telling from ""Mutant Registration Act"" law to the ""Sokovia Accords"", a UN Treaty/Agreement. This makes the story more about who should have ""oversight"" of contractors/military forces like the Avengers, X-men etc. ( a jurisdictional/accountability story line).
This was most likely justified by saying it would contain the expansive ""Civil War"" comic series to a single set of Characters most notably the Avengers and Captain America's team. I think this was a bad call Marvel/Disney could have made at least 3 movies for ""Civil War"". This being said the movie was enjoyable to watch and tried to throw enough bones to the actual comic book readers. It Also should make anyone who views it consider wether it is wise to sign any UN treaty where the UN wants to have say so in your activities.
Now to the Spoilers part......... A few parts of this movie bothered me for logical reasons. It seemed to be told from the point of view of Tony Starks guilty conscience. Every time the movie mentions the need for ""oversight/accountability"" It is preceded by some scene of the Avengers in battle and people that they could not save. Then immediately they next line would have something to do with blaming the Avengers with the death of the innocent/non-combatant people. There should have been a lot of push back on this point by any of the Avengers. The innocent/non-combantants people are dying in the New York incident because of an invasion, Sokovia a crazy person declares war on humanity and so on. Thus firefighters are not held accountable/responsible for people who die in burning buildings unless they do something to cause it. Why aren't the Avengers afforded this same respect/logic. This being said Tony Stark/Ironman and Bruce Banner/Hulk are the only ones who should be held accountable for their actions because they caused destruction, and death directly.
The other thing that was annoying was the dribble that flowed from Vision's mouth about strength inviting challenge. I guess I should cut the android some slack since he is only a few months/years old ;) These are the few cons with this movie. Some pros are first look at The Black Panther, good action, and story. This give  Captain America: Civil War 3 out of 5 shields.",1463788800,5,2814,4.887029288702929
7709602,3,B01D9EUNB4,"While there is a special innate fun to seeing all the heroes together mixing it up, the story is otherwise stiff and unspectacular. In many ways, this film is a pretty close replicate of The Winter Soldier, in that the majority of the film is a series of ham-fisted speeches about freedom and doing the right thing. Several extended sequences are these awkward debates where the characters just tell lecture each other on politics. Given the dual bill of Iron Man and Captain America, its unfortunate that Caps bold heroism and Starks smart-alec wit have both been diluted into the same droll school teacher in their redundant and monotonous diatribes.

The action scenes are all solid, but are largely unremarkable and unimaginative. Everybody can agree upon one standout moment amongst the fighting, but nothing else memorable ever rises above another back-and-forth exchange of fists, including Spider-Mans introduction. The shots and editing lack the super powers and artistry that were more prevalent in Marvels prior outings. The villain is nonexistent and poorly designed. And once the dust finally settles on everything, the story really hasn't gone anywhere or changed things much. Despite Marvels designs to some masterful long-form storytelling, a few subplots from prior Captains are woefully underserved. Disney has no qualms about jamming as many toys-- er, characters into its films now, but that only dilutes the depth and story for everyone across the board.

On another final note thatll further infuriate Marvels maniacs, I liked Batman v Superman more than this one. Both films mined the same ideas of how to control and use power, with ideologically opposed heroes squaring off, but BvS was simply higher stakes, deeper ideas and wilder showmanship. There are many problems with that film too, but at least it had no pretenses about being such a serious and stoic film, and showcased far wilder displays of superhero power.",1463702400,11,1944,5.187898089171974
7709603,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Pre-order this movie NOW.  The action is incredible, inventive, and brutal.  The story is quite good!  By the end of the film, you will have swayed toward each team's argument a few times.

Of course, the effects are impressive--and seamlessly woven into the scenes.  Visually, this film is amazing.  Never corny or campy.

I found that the characters chosen for this film were enough.  The writing and acting brought each hero and villain to life--no cardboard wastes of time here.  You will not miss Thor or Hulk.  The stand outs were DEFINITELY Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ant-Man.  Get ready for some amazing surprises and some perfectly timed comedic relief!

When Spidey and Black Panther are on screen, they steal the show.  Easily!  Quite a few ""Holy Crap!"" moments from these two.

When Winter Soldier is fighting for his freedom, he becomes like an agile Terminator: unstoppable and scary.

When Crossbones shows up, I almost cheered.  The dude is bad, and handles the Avengers almost by himself.

When the main villain's purpose and reasoning is revealed, you might be on his side emotionally.

Civil War is a more serious take on the characters.  It may not jibe with the comics perfectly, but no one should care.  This film is a MUST-BUY.

Entertaining till the end, as relationships (and bodies) get broken mercilessly.  All while giving you food for thought (about responsibility, morality, friendship, freedom, etc.)

Loved it.  Civil War addresses the massive destruction super beings cause, like Batman vs. Superman did, but in a much more thoughtful and visceral way.  DO NOT miss this gem.",1463616000,13,1612,5.011363636363637
7709604,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Is this a new trend? Having superheros fight other superheros? In March we had ""Batman vs Superman"" and now this... If you want to see good guys battle other good guys, get ""Rustlers' Rhapsody,"" at least THAT is billed as a comedy! Like ""B vs S,"" the issue once again is collateral damage. 117 countries are signing an agreement that exerts bureaucratic control over The Avengers and their violent activities.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (""Captain America""), this PG-13 non-stop (but top-heavy) actioner is designed to make us examine our loyalties. Personally, I like Captain America's straight-forward outlook; Iron Man's knee-jerk reaction seems abrupt. Yeah, I'm Team Rogers...

Here is a small part of the massive cast:
  * Chris Evans (""The Iceman"") Steve Rogers/Captain America is a military man. He is accustomed to taking risks and accepting responsibility for collateral damage.
  * Robert Downey Jr. (""Sherlock Holmes"") Tony Stark/Iron Man has been a rebel from the get-go. Why should he change now? Because he has just met a grieving mother who puts a face on the collateral damage.
  * Alfre Woodard (""State of Affairs"") is that grieving mother.
  * Scarlett Johansson (""Hail, Caesar!"") Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow understands their conflict, but she doesn't have to like it!
  * Sebastian Stan (""The Martian"") Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier has NO choice in the matter. His programming by Hydra is so deep he can't trust himself.
  * Anthony Mackie (""Triple 9"") Sam Wilson/Falcon can't avoid this one but we all remember how he met Captain America, so we aren't surprised to see which side he is on.
  * Don Cheadle (""The Guard"") Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine has been with Tony Stark from the beginning and has no regrets.
  * Chadwick Boseman (""42"") T'Challa/Black Panther was a surprise!
  * Jeremy Renner (""American Hustle"") Clint Barton/Hawkeye just wants to stay completely out of the whole mess. He is trying to be retired!
  * Tom Holland (""The Impossible"" he was the teenager who saved his mom after a tsunami) Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a smart-mouthed geek, busy trying to do heroic stuff of his own design. His dialogue is funny and his initial exchange with Iron Man is engaging, witty and welcome.

When our superheroes are told to stand down, guess who follows orders and who doesn't? When I said ""top-heavy"" I really meant it. There is no face you see that you don't recognize. Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Hope Davis, John Slattery, Marisa Tomai, Alfre Woodard, Daniel Brhl, Emily VanCamp, Chadwick Boseman, Martin Freeman, William Hurt and John Kani.  Every character is a star but the only one who gets a vocal response from the audience is Marvel's own beloved Stan Lee, who, once again, nails the funniest line in the entire movie. We LOVE the guy!

The screening audience, dominated by 18-24 year-old men, was appreciative and happy. I'm not an 18-24-year-old male, so I became bored with the endless fisticuffs, gunfire and blowie uppie stuff. This one will make a LOT of money because Marvel's characters are familiar, attractive and superhuman.

By the way, this brand new Spider-Man provides very welcome comic relief and I personally enjoyed this change of pace in a movie so heavily laden with CGI.",1463616000,,3264,5.042910447761194
7709605,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Marvel studios have finally outdone themselves with Captain America: Civil War,the film is the collimation of eight years of fantastical film making, this film handles it's characters in the best of ways by expanding and developing the already introduced Marvel superheroes that we have come to know and love, whilst ingeniously introducing new characters into the midst of the Marvel Film Universe whom all deliver a breath taking performance in their respective roles. The plot focuses on Steve Rogers/Captain America leading a newly formed task force of super-powered heroes; The Avengers into battle in their ongoing mission to restore peace and justice to a chaotic world, while a reluctant and guilt consumed Tony Stark/Iron man sides with the American government to put the avengers 'into check'. The two's different ideologies result in a civil war between the earth's mightiest heroes, feeding our eyes and ears with awe filled action scenes and a superbly executed plot. By any standards, Captain America three is definitely a 'dream come true' and a new record set by the Russo brothers (the directors) in terms of Comic-book inspired film making, undoubtedly a 'must-see', I'm giving it a score of: 9/10 - 'DAMN NEAR PERFECTION'.",1463616000,21,1241,5.241206030150754
7709606,4,B01D9EUNB4,"The Avengers are no strangers to leaving destruction in their paths while on missions and have done so many times before. However, after their latest mission in Lagos, Nigeria causes the accidental deaths of multiple Wakandan humanitarian workers, the Avengers must come to terms with the consequences of their actions, even if they were for a greater good.

As a result of this, the government decides to enforce the Hero Registration Act that will effectively limit the Avengers actions and will only be initiated when the government says so. Iron Man stands by the act, believing that more cities and lives will be destroyed unless their actions are monitored. Captain America on the other hand, believes that they should be free to continue saving humanity without interference from the government. The heated tension between the two leads to an all-out war between Captain America and Iron Man with a number of heroes taking different sides. All the while, a powerful villain rises, looking to dismantle both dueling teams apart from the inside out.

Overall: Initially I wasn't too hyped about seeing Civil War and didn't think it was going to be all that, but Marvel ended up making me eat my words. I want to start off with how extravagantly well done the character and story development was for Civil War. The character development between the characters (mainly Captain America and Iron Man) heats up quickly and connects with the story development that threatens the friendship the Avengers have with each other and could irreparably split them up. The interesting thing about this film is that the primary threat the Avengers face this time is each other. It's ultimately a team of two good guys, fighting for the same cause but with a different set of beliefs that puts a wedge in between them. I'm not going to say who for the sake of spoilers, but there are a lot of non-Avenger Marvel heroes who make appearances throughout the duration of the film who may or may not play a part in Infinity War. The energy in Civil War is at a high, energetic pace for pretty much most of the film and is 5x that from Winter Soldier. The big battle is probably one of the greatest and biggest brawls in superhero film history. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but I'll let you be the judge of that. It's both captivating and comical all at the same time. Overall, Civil War is a film that Marvel managed to excel at in just about every category--unless you're one of those nitpickers. This definitely has potential for being superhero film of the year and YES there is a mid-credits scene AND post-credits scene",1463529600,4,2609,4.769911504424779
7709607,4,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America:  Civil War has been talked about and speculated over for a long time.  It finally arrived on the big screen on May 6th, and it has managed to meet the expectations of most fans and exceed those expectations for others.

I fall in the met expectations crowd.  I was a bit worried that this film would turn into an Avengers-minus-Thor-and-Hulk flick, but it managed to remain true to its title character.

I promise that there will be no spoilers in this review, so read on with confidence.

The film centers around the Sokovia Accords and the demands of 117 governments wanting to be able to control the Avengers and when and where they are allowed into action due to their somewhat destructive nature when it comes to fighting bad guys.  Tony Stark, still reeling from the effects of what happened when he created Ultron and intent on righting wrongs, wastes no time in deciding to sign the papers.  Falling in line with him is War Machine, Vision, and Black Widow.  Captain America, on the other hand, refuses to sign, stating that this will just give the governments of the world total control over him and others like himself.

Not surprisingly, Falcon falls into step behind Cap and Scarlet Witch remains somewhat on the fence at first.

When the time comes to sign the Accords, an attack happens that kills King TChaka of Wakanda.  His son, TChalla, takes the throne and the mantle of Black Panther.  He vows vengeance against the person (who looks mysteriously like the Winter Soldier) that has murdered his father and ends up siding with Iron Man against Captain America.  This leads to a great chase and eventual head-on collision between Team Cap and Team Iron Man.

A few wildcards are thrown into the mix with Spider-Man, Ant-Man, and Hawkeye.  The Wallcrawler suits up with Tony Stark, while Ant-Man and Hawkeye help Captain America.  Theres a glorious battle that ensues which leads up to the revelation of the real villain in the tale.  Hell remain nameless due to my no spoiler guarantee, but he ends up being a brilliant addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  I cant wait to see what becomes of him in the future.

Much like The Winter Soldier, this Captain America flick takes a very serious turn with its subject matter.  Unlike Soldier, this film is quite a bit lighter.  This is in part to the wonderful acting skills and scene-stealing antics of Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) and Tom Holland (Spider-Man).  Despite having small (but important) roles in the film, these two characters inject humor and excellent action into the film.  Basically Ant-Man fanboys all over Captain America and Spider-Man fanboys all over Iron Man, Captain America, and pretty much all of the Avengers on both sides of the tale.  Ant-Man makes jokes, apologizes, and screws up throughout his entire time on the screen.  Spider-Man does much of the same, but with that smart-mouthed attitude weve all come to know and love from young Peter Parker.

Chadwick Boseman is another scene-stealer as Black Panther.  Early on, his vengeance drives him to chase after the Winter Soldier,  but his character matures and changes as the film rolls along.  By the end of the film, I had an entirely new perspective on the character, and appreciated Bosemans presence on the screen.

Chris Evans is Captain America, period.  Whenever they first announced him as the actor who would become Steve Rogers in the MCU, I was a bit worried.  However, Evans embodies the character so well that I find it hard to see anybody else behind the shield.  Robert Downey, Jr.s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man has matured with each film.  The character has gone from a cocky rich jerk to an extremely humbled man looking for absolution.  I hope to see the character evolve even more as he makes more appearances in the MCU.

The rest of the cast did excellent jobs.  Anthony Mackie was fun as Falcon, as was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Don Cheadle as War Machine.  Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany had excellent chemistry as Scarlet Witch and Vision.  I see both of these characters playing larger roles as the MCU continues to grow.  Scarlett Johansson owns Black Widow, and Im glad to see her character become more serious in this film than she has been in the Avengers flicks.  It was also nice to see the return of William Hurt as Thunderbolt Ross, even though hes a despicable character.

The film did bog down between action sequences at times and there was a bit of sketchy CGI involving Iron Man and War Machine and a few sequences during one of the big battles, but overall, Captain America:  Civil War is another solid entry in the MCU.

Go see Civil War.  You won't regret it.",1463529600,5,4670,4.745341614906832

I'm talking the rise of Valiant Comics, Image Comics, Spawn, Bone, The bad girl craze,
Malibu comics, Spider man Maximum Carnage, The Death of Superman, Batman Knightfall, Sin City, From Hell, The Marvel vs DC Limited series and so on
When there was huge money to be made in collecting comic books
The market was at a all time high
Turok: Dinosaur Hunter issue 1 at one point was going for $100.00+

I bring this up cause i spent countless hours with my brother and sister boyfriend at the time going all over, 2hrs away from home going to comic book shops/stores (There was no Ebay or Amazon)
That's the tell of any hardcore collector we all have this OCD/Addiction
and I've seen first hand many a times how nutty comic book fans are
In 2016 i have no dog in the Pro Wrestling fight of DC vs Marvel
If both companies burned to the ground I'd have a laugh and go about my day
Both companies have been bought up my soulless entities for the one reason only
=Money merchandising anything/everything
As Americana as Superman is the S should be a dollar sign same thing with almost every comic book character
None of it's special anymore but, i digress

If you enjoy/love The Avengers: Civil War
God bless you your stronger then me
I can't for the life of me swallow that pill
This film was only put out and rushed due to WB/DC having two comic adaptions out this summer
Marvel wasn't the pretty girl at the dance for once
So they took a brilliant story and rushed it to have a Marvel property out when DC had two films for the summer of 2016
This film is Marvel stroking there ego (laughing at the suckers i mean moviegoers
Cause God forbid anyone call out Marvel/Disney for putting out a cheap mess
I'm not trolling i seen this film last Thurs. it's all smoke,mirrors and hype
They took a solid deep social commentary story and watered it down and just put it out there to draw money!
""A movie has things that move and a book has the freedom where it doesn't have to be in constant motion like that""
In a movie if it doesn't move then it doesn't play....................

Why this film is hype?
The story is so nonsensical and it's bloated no film should run 2.5 hrs.
This ain't Citizen Kane it's a dumb comic book movie
The story drags on and on
Anyone who hates on Batman visits Superman but, loves this are complete hypocrites
Both films are one and the same Both films have the same plot
both films have terrible ""so-called"" Super villains
Both films were made just to be big budget summer blockbusters with no real substance
All the critics going on and on about how this is the best Marvel film of all time
Seriously??? How much were they payed under the table to hype this film
This is far from the best Marvel film it's barely average
Half the cast shouldn't even be in this film
You get the debut in the MCU of Chadwick Boseman playing Wolverine i mean Black Panther
way to go Marvel/Disney instead of making nice with 20th Century FOX and get key members of both the Fantastic Four and X-Men
We get a lame 1970's C List Super Hero in Black Panther (It's funny they did there best for him to be like Wolverine) Epic Fail and cheap
Speaking of cheap Tom Holland doing the V/O of a completely CGI Spider man that looks terrible
What did they do take footage from a Spider man video game and just add that
This film also remind me how much i hate Spider Man (And i find it strange none of the people praising this film have sad anything negative about the cheap look of Spider man he was put in this film last minute the look is prof of that along with a few times his British Accent came through while reading his lines (Great V/O director) This is HQ???
Zemo is worse then Luther in Batman/Superman

Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man annoying it's never once explained why he would take the side of the Government
since Tony Stark is meant to be the rebel why would he fall in line to the man?
I miss the drug addict Robert Downey Jr. that was a fun daring actor now he's just there going through the motions
You can tell he only took this role to get a paycheck

That epic battle at the airport is far from epic it's cheap and means nothing due to the fact the story is so convoluted and lost in itself
The epic battle is very much like this film as a whole anti-climatic
But, at least there's no shameless product placement besides the cars and Spider Man talking about Star Wars another property owned by Disney

What's good very little
Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is much better in this then she was in Age of Ultron
Captain America is good even though it's not his flick (Chris Evans tries he's best)
Bucky Barnes who looks very much like Nomad from the 90's minus the shotgun, sunglasses and baby strapped to his back)
Not sure if he's meant to be Nomad Sebastian Stan doesn't look anything like Bucky that's for sure
Paul Rudd as Ant-Man was also another highlight (maybe has 8 minutes of screen time)
Frank Grillo makes a short cameo as Crossbones and they kill him off
a cool looking Super Villain they kill but Zemo is the white whale this makes no sense
I think i hated this film more then Batman/Superman
how can you mess up the Civil War plot line? rush it and throw everything at the wall and see what sticks and pay a number of critics to hype and praise how it's amazing the film is
2.5 hrs I'll never get back
At some point Comic book adaptations are gonna get tired and old and stop being put out every year
Avengers: Age of Ultron and Civil War are prof that Marvel/Disney are already running out of steam 4.5/10

7709609,4,B01D9EUNB4,"When I went to see this movie in theaters, I wasn't 100% sure on what to expect. I knew this movie was going t be about the Civil War and the Super Hero Registration Act (The Sokovia Accords), but I tried to avoid finding out too much before hand. (Possible SPOILERS Ahead).
 So, obviously, one thing everybody was worried about before hand, was that this was going to be an Avengers 2.5. Well, it didn't seem like it was to me. But it didn't seem much like a Captain America film either. Or Civil War.
 Okay, let me say that it was also all of these. It was about the Avengers, and Captain America, and Civil War, but it also wasn't. When I heard that there was going to be a Civil War film, I imagined it to be Captain America and Iron Man fighting over the registration act, but in fact, the reason they are fighting goes much further, it's not because Captain America disagrees with the Sokovia Accords that makes Iron Man fight him, but because of another mission that arises, causing Captain America to disobey the act, and causing the Civil War to become more of an important part of the setting, rather than the actual plot of the film.
 Continuing on with the plot, I think it is actually the plot that makes it a Captain America film, more than the idea of him being the protagonist. From my observations of the film, Iron Man is as much of a protagonist as Captain America. There stories work together to tell the story, and without both of them, it wouldn't quite work. So like I already said, this is more of a Captain America film because of plot, rather than who the protagonist is.
 Now, about Avengers 2.5, no I don't think it quite made that list either. Although there are quite a few Avengers involved in this film, it just didn't seem like an Avengers film either, taking on a more (although not quite with Vision and Scarlet Witch involved) realistic setting, like the previous Captain America film.
 The Title Implies: Protagonist = Captain America; Plot = The Civil War
 Reality: Protagonists = Captain America and Iron Man; Plot = Captain America 3; Setting = The Civil War
 Let's just say that this is a really weird film when it comes to finding out what it's really supposed to be about, it is still a great next step for Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 My biggest problem is that they're saying this concludes the Captain America trilogy, but because of the other characters included it seems to leave Captain America's story arc unfinished.
UPDATE
 After much thought about the movie, and what quite didn't feel right, I noticed two things. First, it was the impact this had on the rest of the series, second, it didn't seem to offer much more than the trailer revealed.
 But that doesn't seem right:

 Does Civil War have an impact on the rest of the MCU?
 Oh yes, how could a super hero Civil War not have an impact on the further storyline?

 Does the movie offer more than that which is shown in the trailer?
 Yes, there is plenty more.

 Then I discovered the answer:
 It wasn't either of them, it was both! The problem wasn't that it didn't have an impact, or it didn't go beyond the trailer, but that what the movie did offer beyond the trailer didn't seem to have an impact on the MCU. It did have both, but they weren't combined.",1463356800,,3264,4.45546218487395

7709611,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War is a complicated movie full of complicated issues, but the main conflict centers around individual freedom. How much of our personal liberty, our personal right to make choices, should we give up for the well-being of the whole, for society? Should that ever be compelled?

That's a tough question in these days of border walls and religious exclusions. There is something to be said for providing protection and safety for society, but how much of our freedom should we give up for that? How much should be required and how much should be by choice?

But the actual question is, ""Is the movie good?"" That's not a tough question, though it does have a complication. If you've been following the Marvel movies, this movie is great. Incredible. It has everything in it you could want and Spider-Man! (And Spider-Man was amazing (Pun totally intended).)

The complication is that if you haven't been following the Marvel movies (and why haven't you!?!?), this is not the place to jump in. It's not enough to have just seen the Captain America movies or just seen the Avengers movies, you need to have seen all four of those to really understand what's happening in this movie. And, so, while I can understand that being frustrating for someone coming into this without the background, it's so very satisfying to see a complex story come together like this, and, honestly, in a way that I'm pretty sure has never been done before.

I'm tempted to break the movie down and walk through it, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'm not going to do that. Also, there's no real reason to talk about the principal actors. All of them gave the kinds of performances you've come to expect. Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr. are incomparable. And I love Anthony Mackie as The Falcon. I think he's tremendous.

However, let's look at the new guys:

Chadwick Boseman: The Black Panther has never been a character I've followed all that closely. Wakanda is interesting, but it's never been sustainable as a setting for a comic book series much like the ocean has never been sustainable as a setting for a Namor series (or an Aquaman one, for that matter). Inevitably, they have to bring those characters into ""our"" world, and they have never, at least back in when I was reading comics, managed to successfully integrate those characters in a way that made them interesting as primary characters. I hope that changes, because Boseman was excellent as the Panther. He brought just the right amount of gravitas to the role.

Tom Holland: Spider-Man, on the other hand, is a character I've followed closely. Since I was, like, four or five. Maguire's Spider-Man has remained one of my top three super hero movies and portrayals. He really just nailed the role. Holland seems to have returned to that mold, the geeky high school student, something never quite believable from Garfield. To cut it short, Holland was perfect. I have been ambivalent about another Spider-Man re-boot, but I'm now quite looking forward to Spider-Man: Homecoming (and not just because of the ties to this movie).

Emily VanCamp: Okay, so, technically, she's not a new-comer, but she steps up her role in Civil War, so I'm going to treat her as one. She's good. She's good opposite Evans, at any rate. I'd say I need to reserve judgement to see what they do with the character, but it's not clear there will be any further development for the character. At any rate, I'm satisfied.

Daniel Bruhl: Ah, now, this one could be controversial, because the Zemo of the movie is certainly not the Zemo of the comic books. I'm okay with that. The movie universe is not congruent with the comic universe. I'm okay with that, too. And it's probably better that Zemo wasn't running around with a purple hood on his head. Bruhl does a great job in the role. He's convincing. And that's really all anyone can ask of an actor: Did he make you believe?

It's fair to say that I'm biased in favor of these movies, but I think it's safe to say that my bias has somewhat negated by how successful they've been. Marvel has not just made flashy super hero movies; Marvel has made good, even great, movies. They just happen to have super heroes in them.",1463184000,3,4225,4.689608636977058
7709612,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America Civil War revolves around Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark dealing with some tension between the two as Tony feels there should be some regulations regarding how they, as superheroes, handle situations where their special abilities are going to be in use whereas Steve doesn't agree with Tony's regulations. They then decide to form their own teams and go on an action-packed brawl to see who's right and who's wrong. This movie was one of my most hyped movies of the year and I had a blast with the movie! The story is very engaging as the two main characters frequently argue about who's right and I like how the story gets you to think carefully as to who you think is making the right decision, which isn't easy by the way because you understand the different ways Steve and Tony view these potential regulations. Let's not forget about Spider-Man in this movie. I'll admit, I was genuinely surprised with how they did Spider-Man in this movie. He's not in the movie for that long but they made his on-screen time work and I look forward to what he'll do in the upcoming Spider-Man Homecoming. Overall, Captain America Civil War is one of Marvel's best installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of the best comic book movies in recent time. What are you waiting for?

7709617,4,B01D9EUNB4,"In the world of superhero movies, Marvel pretty much reigns king.  Not necessarily because they make the best movies, but because they have the larger ratio of quality to quantity.  Even those movies that belong to the short end of the spectrum can't still be called ""bad"".  This is specially true for the Captain America series.  The second movie, Winter Soldier, was, until the release of this one, the best Marvel movie in existence.  Did the third one break the classic ""third movie in a trilogy is the worst"" trend?  No, it did not.  Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie, and while, again, this is the worst of the series (your mileage may vary if you're not a fan of WWII movies), it's not by any means bad.  In fact, at first sight it looks like one of the best superhero films.  But a little fridge logic and the movie simply can't hold that place for long.

The story goes as follows: The Avengers, in the middle of a mission to stop a terrorist group, end up accidentally getting a bunch of innocent people killed.  This shocks the world into action, and they decide to establish certain accords that will force superpowered people to register with the government and act on their behalf.  The differing opinions between heroes cause them to fall in opposite sides of the situation, those who agree to registration, and those who prefer freedom.  This is complicated by the assassination of the ruler of a foreign country, which is blamed on the Winter Soldier.  Things roll into action as Captain America races to save his friend from an unfair death while Iron Man is forced to arrest him, each hero followed by their own group.

Now, as a story is a neat idea.  It is, of course, based on the eponymous comic, but the similarities are not that many.  The original comic isn't very good, as it pretends to be much smarter than it really is while juggling ideas it can't comprehend and shoving originality aside for spectacle.  This movie... also does the same, but it's much better at pretending to be smart.  Make no mistake, the movie is incredibly, ridiculously, mind-meltingly fun, but the plot falls apart quicker than a game of Jenga with Michael J. Fox.

Marvel has had a lot of issues with villains in their movies.  Save for Loki, there hasn't been one that's interesting or developed well enough.  Things are not much different here.  The villain, Zemo, is, on the surface, an interesting fellow.  Problem is that he's very derivative, his plan relies majorly on luck and his very presence is detrimental to the plot.  Batman v Superman had the same issue.  The heroes having legitimate reasons to fight is interesting.  Them being coerced into fighting by a villain isn't.  Also, comic fans will be dissapointed to know that this guy's similarity to his source material counterpart starts and ends with the name.  If you loved the character of Zemo in the Avengers EMH animated series, prepare for dissapointment too.

Yes, this movie introduces Spider-Man and Black Panther.  Both are absolutely amazing in personification and stunts.  Both could be removed from the film and nothing would change.  Yes, this movie has one of the best superhero fights in history.  It's also ridiculously convenient that no civilians are around at the time.  People give Man of Steel a lot of crap for the collateral damage the hero fighting causes, but Marvel keeps dodging it, which is no better.  Yes, rather than a ""boss fight"", the movie ends with a personal conflict between the heroes.  That conflict is set up so poorly and justified so badly that you'll feel compelled to withdraw everything bad you said about the Batman/Superman fight in BvS.

Yes, there's a lot of warranted comparison to DC's efforts.  True, Marvel is better at a bunch of things, but the truth is that people are unfairly ignoring issues with this film when they had no problem spewing venom to Bvs or MoS for doing the same things.  Again, I'm not saying this movie is bad, but if you're going to dislike or forgive, be fair and do the same for all.  Several conflicts in the film could easily be solved by talking, but the movie wants fights, so the heroes prefer not to talk.  Why is that there's only one scene in which Tony Stark behaves like Tony Stark and it's in one that wasn't originally in the movie (since it includes him meeting Peter Parker)?  Several people who we're told are intelligent instead behave like idiots, because this movie is plot first, characters second.

Please understand that I think this is a great movie.  It's fun, exhilarating and has a lot of great characters.  I'll watch it again in theaters and I'm preordering the Blu-Ray.  I'm just a bit tired of people completely ignoring its problems and pretending it's the Second Coming of Christ.  It's not.  It's not the best superhero movie, it's not the best Marvel movie, it's not even the best Captain America movie.  But it's still worth to watch.  There's not just ""black or white"" options.  Just because a movie isn't the best thing ever it means it's the worst.  Not by any means.  I fully recommend it, definitely go see it.  But be fair.  Be fair in your treatment of this and other similar films.

7709620,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Talk about retrofitting a seminal comic for a combined cinematic universe and hitting the sweet spot in pretty much every way, and as a bonus, it actually improves on its source material. That's what ""Captain America: Civil War"" does. It not only arguably places itself at the top of the Marvel Cinematic Universe kingdom, but it makes for a more viable, personal and emotional story than the comic it's based on.

The basics of good storytelling vs. bad storytelling in cinema will always come down to three things: vision, intelligence and heart. The fact that ""Captain America: Civil War"" came out in such close proximity to ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is more happenstance than a direct competition, but it also can't be ignored. A Batman versus Superman film should be the sixth or seventh film in the DC Extended Universe, and certainly not the second. And while Zack Snyder had a vision, he didn't make a film that had intelligence or heart. But Anthony and Joe Russo, backing up the fantastic work they did on the previous Captain America film ""The Winter Soldier"" actually do a stronger job with a larger palette, which is usually the opposite, and they tell a more emotional story as well. They're naturally helped by the strongest and most complex performances yet by Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. as their respective characters, as well as an extremely smart script from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.

It's also the newcomers like Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa and Tom Holland as Peter Parker that bring a fresh quality to the film as well. Holland is an absolute breath of fresh air as the screen's best adaptation of Marvel's Spider-Man yet and Boseman brings a lot of gravity and talent and physicality to a character that is generally relegated to a supporting character role. Also the villain of the piece may not be as gleefully destructive as Ultron or as seductively maleficent as Loki, but Daniel Bruhl's Helmut Zemo is one of the MCU's most insidious villains. It's actually his insignificance that makes him such a strong villain because he's the person that most people look past. He's looking to destroy the friendship at the core of the Earth's Mightiest Heroes from the inside, and it's not for a loftier purpose like Loki's dreams of a kingdom to rule, or Ultron's removal of human life, or even Hydra's ""order out of chaos"" shtick; he's a man looking for revenge and he may very well get it.

Everything that makes a summer blockbuster great, and pretty much everything that makes a film great is present in ""Civil War"". Will it be as celebrated as Chris Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" when it comes to awards season? No. It'll be largely ignored except for technical awards. But in the annals of superhero films, ""Civil War"" surpasses even the seminal first ""Avengers"" film as Marvel's best work to date.",1462838400,5,2847,4.829918032786885

Captain America: Civil War
 In this, the third film in the Marvel Comics Captain America series, we discover  that the old adage about the third time being the charm comes true.  This spectacular fim has already out grossed film #1 by $300 million and will out draw the very successful second film by the end of the week.  The people have stated their opinion.  The people like this one, they like it a lot.
  I like it too.  We expect fantastic special effects in a big summer movie and we sure get them here.  But beyond the more explosions the better school of special effects, we have imagination and innovation.  They do a trick with a motorcycle that I had never seen before which surprised me and made me happy.  Great job, special effects team.  The fights between super heroes with different sets of skills and gadgets also pleases.  Watch for the battle between Iron Man in his fantastic suit and Ant Man, who is as small and powerful as an ant.  Good fun there.
 But we do not turn out in such huge numbers to see stuff blow up.  We want to see our heroes get into and out of danger.  We want to hold our breath while characters we know and like do their thing.  And these characters do their thing while at the same time dropping in an appropriate quip or two.  They also charm us by their moral courage and their fidelity to their ideals.  These people-well, most of them are people-do the right as they see it and do it in the face of very violent death.
 The civil war in the title involves two competing visions of the role of the super heroes in modern society.  One group accedes to the wishes of the UN to volunteer to place themselves under civil control.  The collateral damage and high civilian body count concerns the governments of the world.  The other group maintains that when trans-dimensional monsters pop into the air over a major city, the Avengers have to go right to work defending humanity.  Both points of view hold merit, morality wise, and each group has a strong willingness to beat the snot out of the other super heroes to make their point.
 Naturally, while they are sorting out their philosophical differences, a peevish mad man endangers the world.
 The cast is stuffed with old friends and a couple of new ones.  Chris Evans is back as Captain America.  He has a great scene where he holds on to a helicopter to keep it from taking off, showing off his muscles in the real money shot of the movie.  Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson come back as Iron Man and the Black Widow.  Anthony Makie is now a star on his own as Falcon.  Paul Rudd has some good, funny lines as Ant Man.  Jeremy Renner and Don Cheadle, both of whom have played major staring roles in very serious films, are back again as Hawkeye and War Machine.  (Forgive me, grown ups, the names of the characters all come from the comic books.)  Paul Bettany appears as Vision, a character too complicated to explain here.  Elizabeth Olsen, younger sister of the famous Olsen Twins, plays a powerful psychic named the Scarlet Witch.  Chadwick Boseman brings in a new character, the Black Panther.  Sebastian Stan reprises his role as the Winter Soldier.
 But wait, there's more.  Young Tom Holland debuts the character of Spider Man and brings the Sony owned web swinger into the Marvel universe.  These super heroes are backed up by Oscar winner Marisa Tomei, William Hurt and Martain Freeman who played Bilbo Baggins.  This movie has a sky full of stars.
 Directing team and brothers Anthony and Joe Russo also co-directed the hugely successful ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"".  They absolutely know how to spend a budget of $250 million to please the people in the seats.
 Writing team Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely work smoothly and successfully together to create the situations and dialog that delight us.  They have now written all three Captain America movies as they did all three of the Narnia films.
 This vastly entertaining film has already brought in some $678 million.  The PG-13 rated film runs for a very long two hours and 27 minutes.  It gets an enthusiastic four saw blades.
Fun Facts- This year marks the 75th anniversary of the first Captain America comic book.  It also marks the 50th anniversary of the newly added film character, the Black Panther.  If you think Marvel has a lot of characters and stars in its movies, be glad.  Marvel has been around a long time.  Marvel has plenty of characters we have yet to see.  Marvel has big plans for the future, lots of big plans.",1462752000,2,4559,4.58364312267658

Most prominent is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) whose all black leather outfit would have clashed with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) so shes only wearing civvies in this film.

Back to the plot.  The United Nations is concerned about the vigilantism of the Avengers, so insists that they be placed under their oversight.  One side lines up with them led by Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.)  The other side wants their independence and is led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans).  Now the first thing that came to my mind is that wouldnt you expect the rebellious Stark to be on the side of the untethered?  And wouldnt you think the patriotic Rogers to be on the side of America?

In the mix is Cap's long time friend, the Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), who is a wanted man for an untold number of killings including a bombing of the U. N. building in Vienna where the resolution is being debated.  That attack gives rise to the aforementioned Panther who as a civilian is TChalla, now the king of some African nation, complete with untold wealth and cool gadgets and powers.

Co-directors and brothers Anthony and Joe Russo return after directing Winter Soldier and get the action right.  With such a large cast it must be a logistical and computer programmer challenge to keep focus.  For the most part they do, but unsurprisingly this can also lead to a lot of blurred action with little detail.  Im not much for lengthy car chases in movies (except for the Furious films) but the motorcycle sequence with Black Widow and Winter Soldier is a lot of fun.  So is the movie, frankly.  But lets not get carried away with the accolades.  This is what I expected, so from that perspective, Im not disappointed.",1462752000,4,2375,4.812345679012346

7709629,5,B01D9EUNB4,"I heard a lot of good things about this movie before I saw it, and I wasn't dissapointed. I will say the film was a bit slower than I expected, but it didn't drag too much in putting together the plot. As usual, Marvel's actors did a great job, fortunately the new ones as well. My main concern going into this movie was how they could shoot a scene with so much action and so many characters and make it flow well. That is what Marvel absolutely nailed in this movie, and in my opinion, the action in Civil War is unmatched, even by both avenger movies. To be brief, Civil War was a lot of fun to watch and possibly my new favorite Marvel movie. A must watch!",1462665600,,660,4.124031007751938

7709631,5,B01D9EUNB4,"...you know which is the best of the previous century (classic director who as made like 20 awesome movies)
If only the screenwriters had done this with BvS movie...I liked BvS but sucked in so many levels, so many flaws...Trying to find flaws in this one makes it so difficult. Obviously the R brothers know what they are doing but they had tremendous help from the back line, something that Snyder didn't have this time ( hope this changes with Johns and Batfleks contribution).
The story was great, the plot even better, all subplots are filled and there is a sense of closure in the end. There is so much going on but everything fits well withing the story line (spidey was funny even though I didn't like the costume CGI and it was weird seeing a different new face but the voice was sure that of Spidey's).
Awesome fight scenes and actions scenes and it is the only superhero movie (maybe together with days of future past) that there isn't one classic villain in the end that would make the whole movie boring, or cliche. That is why I also loved the winter soldier which was similar in a way to this one and I think both of these where better than the Avengers.
I don't know how the Russo brothers will be able to pull up the Infinity Gauntlet movies as of Snyder's style maybe would fit more (yes I know many of you hate him) than the realistic tone that they have set with their two Captain America movies.
Together with the previous 2 captain america's, 1st Thor, 1st Avengers, 1st Iron Man, the Wolverine and man of steel (and edge of tomorrow) these where few of the best movies that I enjoyed watching in the theaters.
I wasn't too excited to see Black Panther or Falcon in this movie, BUT I think they where both amazing, the first really cool (great costume) and falcon managed to show a b comic character as interesting and smart. And both of these actors have charisma which is really important to play out well on screen. I never became bored watching these characters (I was so bored watching Lex Luthor in BvS what a miscasting there -and bad plot-)",1462665600,,2070,4.464379947229552
7709632,4,B01D9EUNB4,"We've finally arrived at the point where supervillains fighting each other isn't nearly as enticing as superheroes, and the matchup between two titans that should never fight -- but that every kid in elementary school bet on who would win -- has finally come to pass.  No, not Batman v. Superman -- Captain America: Civil War!

I have only a passing familiarity with the events in the comic series.  Suffice it to say it involved Marvel facing the grim realities of superheroing: civilian casualties.  In the comic, a bomb was set off in Stamford, CT (somebody in New York didn't like their northern neighbors, I suspect) on live television that precipitates a crackdown on superheroes by the government, with heroes taking sides. On one side is Tony Stark, a human who knows full well the dangers of uncontrolled abilities; on the other is Captain America, who values freedom and choice above all else.

In this third installment of Captain America, the scope has been broadened well beyond the U.S. -- instead, it's a diplomatic catastrophe in Lagos that triggers the Sokovia Accords, a reaction to the massive human casualties inflicted by Ultron in a fictional European country.  As U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross so eloquently states, ""heroes"" like the Hulk are weapons of mass destruction.  And oh yeah, nobody knows where Thor or the Hulk are (don't worry, they're just in another movie).

All this adds up to an epic conflict in which everybody's favorite heroes pick sides.  This of course encourages the audience to pick sides as well, which requires a lot of exposition.  In fact, there are so many characters in this movie that it barely has anything to do with Captain America.

Throughout the movie one thread winds through it all: personal accountability. The film makes a point of showing buildings collapsing from all the other Marvel universe super hero movies, but intentionally leaves out the death toll.  Instead, each main character internalizes the damage on a deeply personal level. And almost all of them react with violence.

The special effects are amazing -- the most subtle being a younger Tony Stark -- with the exception of the Iron Man suit itself (sometimes, Stark's head seems to float on the suit's body).  This is also the best representation of Spider-Man since Sam Raimi's movie over a decade ago.  Too bad Web-Head feels like he was thrown in just to launch another franchise.

My wife is #TeamStark, but I tried to stay neutral until I saw the film.  Civil War doesn't bother making the argument about what the Sokovia Accords mean for superheroes in general, it focuses almost exclusively on the Avengers. It doesn't even share what the rules mean to your average hero  on the street. As a result, Cap's decision -- a decision that is based on a much broader argument about superhero rights in the comics -- seems somewhat selfish and petty.  Cap may be fighting for freedom, but because Civil War doesn't explain itself much, he just comes off as fighting for himself.  I didn't go in favoring Team Stark, but by the end of the film I had to agree with her.

Still, this was a lot of fun.  The villain is more evil genius than super villain and he's motivated by surprisingly prosaic circumstances.  Although it drags in parts, Civil Wars brings it all back down to one person's grief. And that makes a mediocre popcorn film a great one.",1462665600,2,3400,4.824137931034483
7709633,5,B01D9EUNB4,"It really says something that this superhero film is probably deeper and more moving then anything else we'll see this year.
I feel that it really just goes without saying at this point just how good this movie is, but i'll say it anyway. Captain America: Civil War was a phenomenon. Some of the most entertaining, thrilling, moving, personally deep and at times so hilarious you will laugh until it hurts big budget/blockbuster cinema we will likely ever see.
I would honestly call this film one of the definitive superhero movies.
I would rank it the 3rd best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind The Avengers and Guardians of The Galaxy.
SPOILER WARNING, BY THE WAY!
A few negatives I want to talk about first before I go into it. First off, I'm so sick of Marvel rebooting the musical themes in every movie. I loved The Winter Soldier soundtrack so much and was very excited to hear that Henry Jackman was coming back for Civil War, but for pointless reasons Marvel made him compose an all new Captain America theme and scrap all the music of the last film, except for The Winter Soldier's theme. Why does Captain America need 3 theme songs? Fans should be able to think of Captain America and hum his theme if they want to. The music was still decent though, I guess.
Also, Marvel is so weak in the killing character's off department. There is absolutely no reason why Rhodey and Bucky should have survived the events of this film. What purpose is Bucky going to serve in any other film now that the Captain America trilogy is over!? Same goes for Zemo actually. Are you seriously telling me that we'll see him again?
Alright, that was rough and I sincerely apologize because this movie was so good and I really love this franchise so much.
To say that Marvel does a great job with the characters is such an understatement. These are some of the most compelling and well rounded characters we've ever seen in big budget/blockbuster filmmaking.
The biggest thing the film has going for it is just how deep and moving it all is. All of these heroes have hearts of gold.
The acting was outstanding. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal as always and Chris Evans is so strong. The film features fantastic performances from Elizabeth Olson, Chadwick Boseman, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner and really just everyone was so good.
The writing and directing were outstanding!
The first hour of the film worked really well as a great thriller film.
The airport battle was amazing and so hilarious! Giant Man might have been one of the biggest surprises of the entire MCU.
The ending was remarkable. This is one of the first superhero movies ever not to have a happy ending(it feels sort of like The Empire Strikes Back, a film that gets a hilarious shoutout earlier in the movie.) I thought the ending was fantastic and I am very curious to see how the pieces of this storyline get picked up two years from now in Avengers 3.
I would also say plot wise, this film is the biggest game changer in the MCU. Never have any of the 12 previous films(including the 2 Avengers films), took the plot so far and changed the status quo so drastically. That's honestly one of the best parts of the film!
The film also served really well as a conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, especially seeing how a lot of the plot is focused around Steve and Bucky.
I could go on forever talking about this film and there is so much I would like to say that I won't put in this review, but let me just say, although Marvel is continuing to do some things that get more and more frustrating as time goes on, that does't stop Captain America: Civil War from becoming one of the best movies in this amazing, amazing, amazing franchise we know as the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1462665600,,3787,4.587020648967552
7709634,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War lives up to the hype and then some.

Right off the back, it should be said that the set-up to the civil war is handed excellently, with both sides' reasons being valid and understandable. Tony Stark is guilt-stricken for all his and The Avengers' property damage and civilian causalities over the years, while Captain America doesn't want him and The Avengers to be world government puppets. It's safety versus freedom, as simple as that. The Winter Soldier is thrown into the equation as being an ally to The Avengers, which make them look bad in the eyes of the public, especially after he is claimed to be behind a terrorist attack during the Sokovia Accords, the UN act that would keep The Avengers and all other superheroes under world government control. That is to say, there is a villain at play here using the Sokovia Accords act to their advantage.

While it is strange to not see The Hulk or Thor here, the movie doesn't suffer too much for it (other than leaving you wondering where they're at, all this time). They introduce Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Ant-Man (and Giant Man)'s first appearance with The Avengers in this movie. And Scarlet Witch and Vision really stand out and are given much more screen time and character development than they got in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Scarlet Witch and her abilities actually steal the show for several of the movie. There's also quite a few surprises and third-act twists they left out of the trailers, as well! Pretty awesome plot reveals!

Some nitpicks: Again, no Hulk or Thor in this, at all. They also do not ever mention Quicksilver or reference him at all, as if he never even existed. (Maybe this is to keep people from thinking about that other, superior Quicksilver?) They also don't spend as much time setting up the villain motivations, but it's a little understandable here, given all that's going on and some people may actually like the more mysterious take on the villains. Also, there is a bit of trailer-bait in the actual movie (War Machine's downfall, Spidey's debut, Cap and Bucky fighting Iron Man). And a minor thing, but Pepper Pots is missing in the movie, though her character has some relevance. Guess they didn't want to spring on paying Gwyneth Paltrow the money.

Speaking of actors, everyone is top notch, here! Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, as did the newcomers, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland and Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter. Chadwick Boseman  as Black Panther is DEFINITELY a scene-stealer! He'll leave you wanting to see a movie with his character right after the movie's over! Black Panther's action and stunts outshines Cap's in every way! He's a worthy rival to Captain America, though we sadly don't get much of anything as far as his origin story. But that's okay, as his own movie will explain all that. Also, Spider-Man! Spider-Man is incredible in this! Tom Holland is a perfectly cast Peter Parker, as he basically IS a young, teenage Tobey McGuire Peter Parker. If the Tobey McGuire Peter Parker was around 22, this one is essentially the 14 year old version. Peter Parker also gets a pre-Spidey-debut scene with Iron Man as well, setting up a tiny bit of his upcoming movie in the process. But Spider-Man's scenes are just as good as the original trilogy, if not better. Elizabeth Olsen far outshines her older sisters and is the true talent in her family; her performance as Scarlett Witch will definitely be underrated. Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter even manages to hold her own in this, and seems like a prime candidate to be on Agents of SHIELD or cameo in other Marvel movies, similar to agent Maria Hill.

The entire 15-20 minute airplane fight with all the Avengers fighting is also far superior to Age of Ultron and there's never a dull moment or wasted scene! The third act fight with Captain America and the Winter Soldier against Iron Man is also an emotionally powerful scene, as well! Intense action, but also a lot of drama and story.

In short, just go see it. It's likely to be the best superhero movie of the 2016; even better than Deadpool and DEFINITELY better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. This movie is literally the total opposite of Batman vs Superman in every way. You'd think after nine years, Marvel would be losing their step. But they're still on the top of their game and seem to keep getting better! Kudos goes to the Russo brothers and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for crafting such an excellent movie! Just go see it, or buy it on Blu Ray, or DVD. It's that good!",1462665600,7,4617,4.742216687422167
7709635,5,B01D9EUNB4,"The Good:
Similar to Captain America 2, within just a few minutes we're thrown into the suspense and action that sets the tone for the film. Almost each character gets their moment to shine in terms of action or just displaying their special abilities. The MANY different fight scenes will keep your eyes glued to the screen. There's rarely ever a dull moment and the overall pacing of the film was done very effectively despite being over 2.5 hours long. I think its also safe to say that the airport scene is by far one of the best scenes in the film.

There were so many surprises in this film. Rarely do I get to say this, but the trailers actually didn't give a lot away. The trailers were altered to the point where some things will still look new.

The themes and writing in this movie were carried out in a believable, coherent and authentic way. The motivations of the many characters did not seem forced, in my opinion. This led to some nice plot twists that continue to progress the story. (Though some of those twists were mildly predictable). It's rather difficult to choose a side of one of the characters because the moral lines are so heavily grayed. As a fan of the Civil War comics (great read by the way), I was very appreciative of how Marvel was able to stay true to the nature and feeling of the source material even though they had to change a lot of the details for the sake of the movie. They did a great job of handling issues like the collateral destruction of cities, the loss of life, and the responsibility of great power.

What's even more interesting is how the movie is able to maintain an overall serious tone but still find time to have many humorous moments. It's not a comedy, but it does stay true to that ""Marvel Fun"" that we've come to enjoy.

Lets get into the characters. Its no surprise anymore that Spider-Man is a feature in this film. His scenes are probably one of the biggest highlights in the movie for both his humor and the action he brings to the table. Luckily what you see in the trailers is only a tiny glimpse of whats to come with Spidey.

Zemo (played by, Daniel Brhl) made for a good villain in this story. It was interesting to see how his motivations drove his actions. Similar to how Tom Hiddlestons Lokis character was developed, we are given a bit more complex villain with Zemos character.

Black Panther....YES! He was AWESOME. Yes Im biased because hes like the first black superhero (And because you knowIm black) I was so happy and proud to see Chadwick Boseman bring this character to life. From his African accent, presence of royalty, all the way down to his proficient cat-like ninja fighting style, he truly embodied what the Black Panther character always intended. (That is to have a sense of pride in African culture) His role in the film has definitely made me more optimistic about the upcoming solo film.

I was impressed with how this film was able to juggle so much at once. With this huge cast of characters, it rarely felt as though any one of them suffered from a lack of screen time. Not only that but Civil War also managed to still serve as a platform for the upcoming solo movies.

The Bad:
What?! Theres some bad? I know I was shocked too, but bear with me. Theres are two issues I had problems with, but they're kind of spoilery so I won't list them here. If you're really interested, just visit my youtube channel (Search for Eman's Movie Reviews) and you can see the two things i had an issue with.

The Reason:
I think its safe to say that Marvel has done it again. Civil War had a lot of expectations and I think it delivered on most of them. I know a lot of people really want to compare this to Batman V Superman because the movies share practically the same themes. I think that while this may feel like a natural comparison to make, it may be a little unfair to do so. Batman V Superman had a completely different motive and intent behind it. It was a setup movie for all of the other movies DC wants to kick off. (Not to mention they had to play catch up in the comic book movie realm) Civil War was a solo movie for Captain America that just so happened to set up other movies and continue the overall story arc of the Marvel cinematic universe.

So I think a much better comparison for Civil War would be to its predecessor, Captain America 2: Winter Soldier. Avengers: Age of Ultron was best compared to Avengers 1 because it was the same director trying to do better than before. Avengers 2, unfortunately, disappointed because it was really more of the same without very many new aspects to elevate the movie. All we got were the superhero team-up moves and three minor characters.  (Well2 other characters that lived.) :-/

If I had to compare the two, Id probably say that Civil War comes in slightly lower than Winter Soldier. Winter Soldier gets the edge for its originality. It was the first time we saw an espionage film that just so happened to have super heroes in it. It was the first time we saw super heroes cross into a different movie genre, thus making it rather hard to top. There was no way for Civil War to be any more original than Cap 2, in my opinion. Civil War does give us more of the same compared to Cap 2, except it does two things uniquely different. Were given two new major characters in Spider-Man and Black Panther, and it accomplished the seemingly difficult task of juggling many characters at once. The movie was about 55% Captain Americas story 25% setup for new characters and 20% everyone else.

Overall, Civil War was a very good movie. There are also two end credit scenes, so be on the lookout. Id say Civil War is a must see in any format.

7709637,5,B01D9EUNB4,"More superhero infighting.

The reasons are similar to the Batman/Superman thing, vigilante action causing collateral damage irregardless of the fact they are saving the world. The world wants to control the Avengers under a set of protocols. Some agree to them, while others do not and it was opposite from what I expected. Meanwhile there is a bad guy who is not a bad guy sometimes and a friend of Captain America except when he does bad things...so pay attention.

I thought the film was about as entertaining as the last one until the end which explodes on the screen with action, humor, and drama.... and we get a non-formula ending, but not as bad as killing Superman VS Batman.

The film also introduces some new Avengers, of which the geeky Tom Holland gets to be Spider-Man. Paul Rudd as Ant Man joins the group in a small role. It is interesting to watch the Avengers battle as there is a lot of talking going on between themselves. The infighting seemed a bit ridiculous and could have been easily avoided, but that film would not be as exciting to watch. Whoever is doing the stunts, my hat is off to them especially Crystal Hooks, Heidi Moneymaker who doubled for Scarlett Johannson. Incredible. No Hulk or Thor or Pepper. Great action film. Iron Man/Stark not as funny and crisp as he was in the past. He was better as a straight man with Spider-Man:

Peter Parker: ""I can't go to Germany.""
Tony Stark: ""Why Not?""
Peter Parker: ""I got homework.""

What made the whole film unbelievable was the Stark Compound chess board was set up with white square in the left corner and not right.

The film is less preachy in its theme. Non-Avenger Lives matter? Don't handcuff the troops? Revenge is a dish best served cold?

7709638,5,B01D9EUNB4,"CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR really delivers the goods, giving us a comic book movie with everything a good comic book delivers: a great story, compelling characters and incredible action.  Unlike AGE OF ULTRON, this time you really believe the heroes are in real jeopardy, because the ones at their throats are their fellow Marvel brothers in arms. That is the genius of the Marvel Universe Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and all the others put together back in the 60s: its all really one big family, and as we all know, there is nothing more bitter and furious than a family feud.  In CIVIL WAR, Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury is nowhere to be seen, and without big brother Nick, all the other siblings in the Avengers have a tough time getting along.

The plot hinges on an Avengers operation in Nigeria which leaves a lot of collateral damage, not the first time such a thing has occurred.  So when there is a demand that the Avengers submit themselves to the control of the United Nations, there is real dissension in the ranks when Captain America refuses to follow Tony Starks lead and sign on with the new arrangement. Things take a real turn when The Winter Soldier, aka Caps childhood friend Bucky Barnes, is revealed to be responsible for a new act of terror; Tony Stark wants to hunt down the terrorist Bucky, while Cap doubts his guilt and wants to discover the real perpetrator.  Thus sides are drawn as other members of the team line up with Team Iron Man or Team Cap.  Bucky is tracked down in Berlin, and a race is on to get to him first.  Before it is over there will be multiple confrontations and a brutal revelation at the end.  I give the scriptwriters credit for not wimping at the finale and have everyone hug and just makeup like nothing has happened.  There are some tough bygones to be bygone.

The biggest thing CIVIL WAR has going for it is the action scenes, which are incredibly well staged with good use of CGI and expert stunt work.  The confrontation at the Berlin airport, when both sides really square off had been justly praised as one of the finest fight sequences ever staged; its over twelve minutes of sheer fun.  What is so great about it is that it allows all of the super powered participants to really use their powers to the fullest, as it should be in a super hero movie. Its a huge cast of combatants and everyone gets their moment to shine, some more than others; it truly makes the movie.  But for me, nothing tops the chase scene where Bucky grabs a speeding motorcycle in mid air and then mounds it and speeds away; second to that is when Cap grabs a departing helicopter with one hand and holds on to a hand rail with the other, his bulging bicep reminding us just what a super soldier can do. The special effects are never cheesy, even when a certain macro sized hero makes an appearance, an effect that often looks exactly like an effect in other movies.

For the most part, the screenplay avoids the clunky plot turns and motivations which often mar comic book adaptations, I give great credit to Christopher Markie and Stephen Feely for clearly understanding the characters and what made them so appealing in the first place, with more than a few nods to some iconic moments form the comics, such as when Cap raises his shield high in one scene as if he is about to decapitate Tony Stark. They have wisely built on what has come before; it is essential to have seen every other Marvel movie, especially AGE OF ULTRON before seeing CIVIL WAR.

And as usual, the casting in spot on, with the returning Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. as Cap and Tony, a pair of true brothers who see the world very differently.  Evans has always risen to the challenge of making a straight shooting character from the 40s relevant in the 21st Century, never more so here, when takes a stand on conscience and refuses to back down.  Downeys Tony Stark is showing the scars of battle and feeling the guilt for some of his actions, but he still has plenty of attitude left.  Back are Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Don Cheadle, Elisabeth Olesen, and Sebastian Stan in roles that have come to fit them like gloves.  And it is good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang/Ant Man, so soon after his first movie appearance in the part, no need to guess which side he is on. Daniel Bruhl, who was in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, is the villain of the piece, Helmuth Zemo, a character very different from his comic book incarnation.  He turns out not to be just another power mad super villain, but a man with an very understandable agenda.

The real bright spots are the newcomers: Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider Man.  Boseman does true justice to the African prince, TChalla, an iconic comic hero brought to life on the screen for the first time.  Hes a most welcome addition to the MCU.

Hollands Peter Parker, is for me, spot on, as this is his first appearance in the MCU after two movie incarnations of his own.  Thank God we don't have to do the origin story again as this Peter already has his powers and is recruited by Tony Stark to fight on his side.  Its the perfect take on his character, making Peter the nerdy high school kid he was way back in Amazing Fantasy #15.  Im not knocking Toby Maguire or Andrew Garfield, but its great to have a Peter Parker who clearly having a great time being Spider Man.  As for Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, they wisely make a point commenting on the obvious differences between her and the actresses who previously played the part.

Theres a good supporting cast which includes Frank Grillo (as Crossbones), Martin Freeman, and William Hurt, who gets to repeat his role as General Thunderbolt Ross, who has gotten a promotion.

For me, the final fight between Tony Stark, Captain America, and the Winter Soldier is one of the most brutal things ever in a super hero movie as they go at each other with all their might and skill, no one holds back and for the first time in a Marvel movie, we are not sure how things will turn out.

All praise to the Russo brothers, who pick up where Joss Whedon left off and really build on his work, and in the end lays out the groundwork for the next stage of the MCU, where Hollands Spider Man will get his own movie, same for Bosemans Black Panther.  As for the future of the Avengers, Thor and the Hulk, (who amazingly, are not missed) are still out there, they could bring in the Secret Avengers storyline; why not some characters from Young Avengers as well?

And while they're at it, somebody needs to get the ball rolling for an Avengers/JLA crossover movie.  It could happen.",1462579200,5,6651,4.492116182572614
7709639,4,B01D9EUNB4,"This movie was great. It was amazing. I don't really have much to say, except just watch it.
Captain America: Civil War includes most of the Avengers (if not all, I don't really remember) and is good in many ways. It rivets your eyes to the screen with the intensity of the battles and interesting plot line.
Just saying, there's lots of humorous scenes and I won't ruin them for you all :)
The reason that I didn't rate this 5 stars is because it just didn't have the feel of the Avengers movies, whereas it brings most/all of them into this movie. I don't know how exactly to explain it, but The Avengers: Age of Ultron and The Avengers just left me with a better impression (by a little).",1462579200,,691,4.323076923076923
7709640,1,B01D9EUNB4,"I loved the movie when I first saw it. And went to see it again, when I noticed something that just ruined the movie for me.

Where was Vision at the beginning of the movie? It's not like he had a personal life or something more important to do. All Vision really has is being an Avenger, and when the Avengers are on a mission to prevent a terrorist from gaining access to a chemical weapon, shouldn't it be ALL HANDS ON DECK? But nope, no Vision. And you know why? If Vision had been there he would have clocked that bomb vest from the get go and he would have gotten Crossbones far from civilians. No casualties at all.

Which means no movie. This ENTIRE movie relied on the massive plot hole required at the start of the movie. You fill in that plot hole by having Vision present at the beginning, and the rest of the movie just falls apart. So even though I liked aspects of the movie, I can't call it a good movie or give it a good score when the movie can't function without plot holes.

There's another plot hole the movie needed to make it work. All of the Avengers forgot about to mention to Ross that they saved New York from a nuke launched by the US GOVERNMENT. They also refused to speak up and point out that had they done nothing in the other instances he whined about, there would be no humans on Earth because Ultron would have KILLED THEM ALL.

And suddenly there were mass casualties in Sokovia? Really? Because I remember Age of Ultron made a point of showing the Avengers getting all of the civilians onto the hellicarrier. Now, for the sake of this movie's plot to make the Avengers look dangerous, they suddenly had a lot of dead civilians to blame on the Avengers. PLOT HOLE.

And here comes the second biggest plot hole of the movie. How did Zemo know Tony was just going to suddenly figure out Cap had been right the whole time and how did he know that Tony would show up in Russia to aide Steve, giving Zemo the chance to show the camera footage of Bucky killing Tony's parents to further cement the rift in their friendship? And I also love how convenient it was that there just so happened to be a security camera right there in such a perfect spot to catch the alleged expert assassin Winter Soldier (didn't pop the camera before you walked in front of it?) as he killed Tony's parents. He even made a point to pose in front of the camera, looking right into it like everyone watching was supposed to freak out and squeal with delight and shock. I mean, I thought Bucky was going to hold up a sign at the camera that said, ""Check it out Tony, I totally killed your parents and hopefully Steve doesn't keep that knowledge from you because that'd be totes awkward at the Avengers hang out, amirite?""

I loved Spider-man in it. Well, not his completely CGI costume. But character wise he was just like the comics.

The action was great. But the problem is that Spider-man and the action being good doesn't make up for how bad the plot holes in this movie truly are.

I love how so-called ""Professional Critics"" have looked over all of these plot holes. I also love how many comic fanboys ignore them as well. It's like, 'Let's pick apart anything made by DC while celebrating Marvel for the same things we claim to hate DC movies for and let's write off X-men because it's totes not fair they won't let Marvel Studios have those characters back for their plot hole, McGuffin riddled movies.

This movie has a high score on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. And it just shows that when people say they hate plot holes, it just means as long as it's not a Marvel Movie will they hate plot holes. All of the plot holes people have whined about in Batman v. Superman are all either not plot holes or just nitpicking. Like the ""Why are their Moms both SUDDENLY named Martha? It's like, sure they've had those names in the comics for decades and were named by different writers, but we need something to complain about!!!"" Batman v. Superman wasn't perfect. But it doesn't deserve the massive hate it gets when all people do is parrot what some ""professional critic"" has to say. Professional critics who refuse to admit to the problems that every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie has. And as little hate as BVS deserves, Captain America Civil War doesn't deserve a fraction of the praise it's been getting.

Marvel Studios suck nowadays. They all need McGuffins (Bucky was this film's McGuffin), they all follow the same exact formula, there are always plot holes needed to make these movies work to keep the shared universe working.

I know some people will read this and want my head on a pike. But if it's okay to criticize one studios movies, then it's fair to do the same to Marvel. Especially when everyone is just being willfully blind to this so-called ""Perfect"" movie's problems.

I can't wait to see the next Avengers movie to see the Avengers going after a bunch of McGuffins while continuing to fight eachother, before comically beating Thanos. Do you think maybe Hulk will smash him super easy and say ""Puny God"" like he did that other 1 dimensional villain? Ooh, maybe Tony will be able to make a Mary Sue armor that allows him to stand against the Infinity Gauntlet. It'll be crap, but it'll get critical praise. Maybe they should call it ""Avengers: Age of Plot Holes"", it'll probably win an Oscar.",1462579200,58,5326,4.4681069958847734
7709641,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Captain America: Civil War makes the impossible possible.

Over its 147 minute runtime, directors The Russo Brothers along with screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, manage to produce a film that pays off thirteen films of build-up from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kick off Phase 3 with a bang, and with characters throughout the world of the Avengers aboundmake it a movie that is focused on Captain America.

Moments large and small from the Iron Man trilogy, the prior Captain America flicks, and the two Avengers films come to light as the superheroes weve come to know and love over the last eight years collide  but how do they come to blows?

While these heroes have always seemed to rub each other the wrong way (usually with hilariously sarcastic results), the story here is a very loose adaptation of Marvels Civil War comic series from 2006.

The Avengers have been the worlds protectors since 2012s The Avengers  with mixed results. Yes, they saved the day in the end, but with every victory has come collateral damage. Between The Battle For New York (from the first Avengers film), the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. (as seen in the prior Captain America installment, The Winter Solider), the destruction in Sokovia (last years Age of Ultron), and a mission gone wrong in Lagos (seen in the movies wonderful, Mission: Impossible-esq opening sequence), the United Nations want the Avengers to stop acting of their own accord, and instead submit to a document called, appropriately, the Sokovia Accords. This would turn the Avengers from an independent group of do-gooders into the weapon of the United Nations. And from there grows the split.

As weve seen in Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has grown from being the first hero of the modern age to a man filled with worry and regret. He wishes to give in to the greater ambition. On the other side is Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). While Americas living, breathing icon  the events of The Winter Soldier have changed his outlook on the trustworthiness of the government, and whether or not any group should have such absolute authority. Its a conflict that cuts to the core of our heroes, and will cut to the core of audiences. And smartly  the film never really picks a side. This will be something that fans will debate as much as our heroes do. And they do like to debate.

Theres no need to worry, action fans  the debates may start around a conference table, but they do not end there. Civil War is filled with some incredible action sequences, including stunning hand-to-hand combat, an insane chase sequence, and the long-awaited clash of Team Iron Man (Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow, Spider-Man, Black Panther and Vision) and Team Captain America (Captain America, The Winter Solider, Falcon Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Ant Man) being one of the most amazing superhero action sequences ever rendered to film  finally giving the Battle for New York a run for its money. The only sequence that may outclass it? An emotionally wrenching finale, mixing one of the bleakest endings from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with some of the strongest personal stakes punctuating every punch with extra weight and feeling.

Before you start to worry  Civil War IS a film with significant weight, but the character moments that have always made the Marvel Studios films a joy to watch remain here. There are hilarious character moments  including some pairings fans will be going on about for some time, and theres even a new romance or two in the air.

How do they manage to make this work? It certainly is assisted by the fantastic casting done to this point. We know this cast. We love this cast. We don't want to see them hurt  or hurt each other  but we cannot take our eyes off the screen. Some how, even with the focus on Chris Evans Captain America, EVERY character gets a moment to shine, with Paul Rudds Ant Man finally playing with the big leagues, and Robert Downey Jr. doing possibly his best work as an older, wiser Tony Stark. Hes not the enfant terrible of 2008s Iron Man anymore. And even with that  three NEW characters are added to the mix, and somehow manage to shine just as bright.

Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther is a character unlike any seen in the MCU to date. His royal past shines, as he carries himself with style and grace, and he adds tremendous gravitas to what could be a thankless role in others hands. That said  most audiences will be coming out of the theater raving about Tom Hollands Spider-Man. I didn't think it was possible, but Holland manages to make himself known as the PERFECT Peter Parker AND the PERFECT Spider-Man. Like I said, the impossible is possible now. You will be absolutely giddy for Spider-Man: Homecoming by the time the credits role. I also need to call out the work of Daniel Brhls Zemo. His version of Zemo has been under the radar throughout the promotion of this film, but goes places no Marvel Studios villain has before  and while not the Zemo we know from comics  is incredibly effective and heartbreaking.

This time last year, fans were unsure of the end of Phase 2 for Marvel. Age of Ultron didn't deliver exactly what we wanted  but as the Civil War has broken out, Phase 3 begins with a seismic shift of the Marvel Cinematic Universe we knew  and with an Infinity War on the horizon, I find myself aching for the next installment.

Captain America: Civil War is an excellent story, well told, that delivers for the fans and leaves you breathless for the next installment.

Congratulations, Marvel Studios. Congratulations, Russo Brothers. Youve reached the next step of comic book movies  Im locked in as I need to know where we go next, and that next adventure cannot come soon enough.",1462579200,12,5760,4.755020080321285
7709642,5,B01D9EUNB4,"Thing is, in real life, we'd all be on Iron Man's side on this. In real life, we wouldn't want vigilantes with crazy powers - some of whom can wipe out a city in a day - running around without some sort of oversight. Robert Downey, Jr. acts the sh-- out of this movie, plays up Stark as the embodiment of guilt, despair, and raging ego. But I feel folks are still sleeping on Chris Evans. CIVIL WAR relies on our buying into Cap's contention that the Avengers should have agency to operate on their own, never mind that 117 nations vehemently beg to differ and that Stark offers a potent argument for being put in check. Cap's conviction is deeply rooted in his disenchantment with S.H.I.E.L.D. and in his innate philosophy on freedom and the right to make your own choices. He's not budging. If Evans had fumbled even for a moment, the movie would've promptly collapsed. Because Stark has logic on his side. Except, in the course of what? thirteen movies now?, Cap has become the heart of the MCU, the moral compass of it. And that's a nod to Evans' knack to compel you and sway you and convince you. Chris Evans also acts the sh-- out of this movie.

If you're walking into this movie thinking ""Oh, no, these heroes ain't going hard at each other; they probably just gonna trade yo mama jokes"" - belay that thinking. CIVIL WAR enters that rarified air what's breathed in only by the likes of THE DARK KNIGHT, THE AVENGERS, and WINTER SOLDIER. The Russo bros are the truth, man. And I don't want to sell writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely short. They and the Russos, more than anyone else right now, are the integral threads that weave thru the MCU tapestry. What they've wrought here is a striking landscape of contrasting stances on themes such as personal accountability, collateral damage, and that oh-so-fine line that straddles autonomy and security. It's a remarkable morality play that takes time to present the characters' viewpoints in articulate ways. I love that there is real debate that goes on, and only when that falls thru - and the shadowy big bad starts finessing things - do the fists fly furiously. I appreciate that each character's motivation is laid out clearly, even the minor characters. When they pick a side, you get why. Someone I know complained that, by the movie's end, there's no resolution to the argument. Thing is, there's no right or wrong to it. Each side is right AND wrong. That's the beauty of it.

The creative team had a chore list of things to get done. They had to manage twelve superheroes, a villain, and an assortment of non-super supporting characters. They had to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man to the MCU, and do that in style. They had to make sure Iron Man isn't the jerk he was in the comics. They had to do honor to the source material. They had to comb William Hurt's mustache. And they had to tell a stand-alone Captain America movie. Man, did they check all those boxes.

CIVIL WAR delivers payoff after payoff. It is wildly entertaining. It has crippling emotional weight. It explores in good depth the nature of real consequences. We see how various Avengers react when faced with the conscience-crushing burden of having perpetrated, however inadvertently, innumerable civilian casualties. Scarlet Witch is one who's particularly riddled with guilt. Gratifyingly, Wanda Maximoff is fleshed out even more, and we get an inkling of just how powerful she is. (Still, I wish her power set is better defined - I want to see her reality-warping hex powers explored more; as it is, she's just a really powerful telekinetic.) And will someone give Black Widow her solo movie already? Anyway, just about everyone gets a moment to shine. The only one I feel was sort of short-changed was War Machine. But maybe the Russos owe Terrence Howard some money.

The humor comes across organically. Spidey and Ant-Man steal so many scenes, which is to be expected. But who knew Falcon and Winter Soldier could be so droll together? And the action? Omigosh, the airport sequence - the hype is real! That airport sequence presents a giddy 17-minute frame that celebrates the awesomeness of superhero pictures. Things happen in that extended sequence - joyous things that I never thought I'd ever get to see beyond a 2D comic book panel.

But, wait - Let me address one common nitpick. Certain folks have bellyached that, once again, an MCU movie has rolled out a tepid villain, that Zemo is a mere plot device that moves the narrative along. And, okay, certain folks aren't wrong. But have patience with Zemo. Daniel Brhl is a hell of an actor and he makes something out of this big bad. By the end, you may see Zemo as a tragic figure. You may even sympathize with him.

Okay, back to the gush. Chadwick Boseman crushes it as T'Challa. He captures Black Panther's regal stature and his grace and distinct fighting style. Black Panther didn't give a what about anyone else's motivations. He had his own agenda and there were many times when his vendetta drove him thru other characters' story arcs. He's such a force. There's this sense that the mantle of unstoppable badassery was passed down from the Winter Soldier to him.

And Tom Holland crushes it as Peter Parker and as Spidey. This is the webslinger I'd been waiting for. I won't say much more, except this last bit - it's the bit that probably gave me the most joy about this latest iteration of Spidey. Peter Parker lives in Queens, New York. And, for the first time ever, Peter's speaking with a Queens accent. That soupon of detail, more than anything else, got me promptly on board with Holland.

There's a lot of sideshow moments that still seamlessly fall in with the core narrative. The story always comes back around to Cap. CIVIL WAR slaps the static out of the MCU. It shakes up the status quo. I am so curious to see where and how the next Avengers story picks up. For now, I'll probably see CIVIL WAR a ton more times, probably cry more nerd tears. There are light, sparkly moments in the film, moments of breeziness desperately required to offset the more dominant moodiness and that undercurrent of seething fury. The third act, Cap and Stark's personal conflict comes to a head, and it's no joking matter. There's a sense of friendship irrevocably shattered, of bridges burned. It shows off Robert Downey, Jr. at his acting peak and delivering such a raw performance. And neither is Chris Evans chopped liver. I love the crap out of this movie.

By the way, I don't understand why people still elect to take off once the credits roll. But you know better. You'll stick around for two post-credit stingers.

I guess I have one major nag and here's a **SPOILER** alert. I have an issue with Zemo's end game crucially hinging on Cap, Iron Man, and Bucky all ending up in that Soviet bunker so that Zemo could show Stark the video clip of his parents' deaths. But, for Zemo, it seemed more a moment of serendipity than precise orchestration that all three showed up there at the same time. It bugs me.",1462579200,28,7033,4.664516129032258

7709644,5,B01D9EUNB4,"This is one of the best Marvel movies to date, and by far, the best in the Captain America series.  Some might see it as Avengers 2.5, but the Russo brothers have done another remarkable job of creating a unique action/thriller that calls itself a comic book movie.  With plot twists, you won't see coming and a villain you never expect, this newest installment delivers in every way any fan of this genre or filmmaking in general, could hope for.  Solid character development with shared space that is effortless, never infringing upon any adjoining on-screen presence, a definitive and satisfying balance between plot and action, and well time perfectly placed humor that enhances every scene and brings a noticeable and refreshing humanity, fleshing out our heroes in the way only Marvel can.  In addition, the introduction of new characters to the fold is both fluid and effective.  Both Boseman and Holland give standout performances worthy of the heroes they represent.  This is a respectful retelling that compliments all predecessors of the franchise, paying homage to canon while successfully creating a unique and original spin on this comic classic.

7709647,5,B01D9EUNB4,"This surprisingly somber Marvel movie carries its weight in themes of ideals/ politics, relationships, and especially loss. ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to its name. Friends and partners get hurt, the Marvel cinematic universe is changed, there is nothing but superhero-on-superhero violence, and there are a few twists and surprises thrown in too. For anyone who has seen the multitude of trailers for this movie first and foremost you're going to marvel a bit at how much of those trailer clips occur in the first 20 minutes of this movie and secondly how much (wonderful) misdirection those edited clips will cause. Just as you expect one thing, something else happens or happens in a different context and this is great because the film offers several worthwhile surprises. But make no mistake: there is truly felt hurt and loss felt by us and our favorite on-screen heroes that is at the heart of this film, and an absolutely fantastic (and satisfying!) introduction to the Black Panther and a very good introduction to the (official) Marvel cinematic universe version of Spider-man.

[NOTE: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD]
Though this movie is mostly somber in tone there is still the insertion of that particular brand of Marvel humor that naturally comes out through character interactions and though ""Civil War"" doesn't contain as much as some of the other movies it manages its share with most of it concentrated in the (joyfully fun) main team-on-team battle. These heroes really don't want to be fighting each other, but alas they do, and amidst all of the action in this main battle you will laugh several times courtesy of interactions dealing with Spider-man and Ant-man. The heart of this fight is fun and light and that contrasts very much with the heart of the fight between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, which has a painful-by-way-of-betrayal feel to it. You may be awed and dazzled at times by that fight, but you'll likely be wincing and cringing too, and hurting and stinging a little bit afterwards. Nobody wins. There are several other fights/ battles throughout the movie that all do a great job in advancing the film's story and by movie's end every single character has been given important and memorable and showcase moments (of course some more than others but nobody gets short-shrifted as they may have been in either one of the Avengers movies). And for anyone who is worried that this is ""Avengers 2.5"" as has oft been reported you better believe that it is still, very much and truly so, a Steve Rogers/ Captain America film. You may or may not respect him as much as you already do by movie's end but the film is driven by his will (to paraphrase his thought: ""If everyone in the world is telling you to do something that you know in your heart is wrong, even if they're telling you to do it for the right reasons, then it's your job to plant yourself like a tree before them and tell them, 'No. You move.'"")

At the heart of this movie are relationships: Cap to his team and to Tony/ Iron Man; Cap to Bucky; Tony Stark to his legacy/ to the world; everyone's to the body politic/ government(s); Bucky/ the Winter Soldier to his history and the people he's hurt; T'Challa/ the Black Panther to his title and his father's memory; and...some emerging romances. There's a lot going on and because so much of it is about relationships we connect to it, especially to Steve and Tony, brothers who are at odds and who hurt each other in very literal ways and who can't seem to help it; they are driven as much by their demons as by their ideals (if you get the chance watch ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and the ""Avengers"" and then Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and finally ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" before you see ""Civil War""--very satisfying to do so). The conflict between the two is naturally driven by the governments of the world wanting more than oversight--they want control--of the Avengers and want to be able to decide what they do (and don't do). Cap A (Steve Rogers, Avengers team leader and heart of the team) and Iron Man (Tony Stark, team financier and political manager/ CEO), as do members of the team, disagree over what to do in this case. Tony, whose guilt continues to increase over collateral damage and who feels the constant need to protect what he loves (Pepper, his teammates, the world), capitulates to the governments of the world's demand for control if for no other reason than ""it's going to happen eventually anyways...and they're not wrong"" while Steve recognizes that those self-same governments, who have agendas, would then be controlling the Avengers as their own personal tool/ weapon and he's not willing to give up his freedom of choice and ability to do that. Speaking in terms of contemporary politics Cap has been painted as the Democrat and Iron Man as the Republican. Nothing could be further than the truth. Cap's ideology falls more along the lines of Libertarian (strongly favoring personal freedoms and taking responsibility for those freedoms and personal actions) while Stark's falls along contemporary Democratic (and some would rightfully argue Republican) tendencies toward big government and their control and oversight of personal liberties (i.e., ""government knows best""). These ideas/ ideals that these characters hold are important, contemporary, have been naturally drawn into the story, and completely satisfying. Both sides make important points/ arguments and while the fil favors one (I'm not telling...) it presents both with respectful balance. In short, you can see both sides and can pick your own side. And as the film presents, there are consequences to picking a side.

My last critiques will be to note the theme of loss and what I didn't like about the film (before I move on to major spoiler comments about individual characters). The main movers in this movie have all suffered or are currently suffering under loss: Cap, the ""man out of time"" has a confederate in his pal Bucky who is also a ""man out of time"" but Bucky is still lost to Cap as the film begins. Cap also loses Peggy, and he loses his team, and he loses Tony. Tony has lost his parents and we see how that has affected him (it's very important to the story), and he is losing his confidence, and his team, and his brother in Steve. Bucky has lost his freedom and ability to be self-determined. The Black Panther has lost his father. One could say the film's main villain is loss and how it affects us (oh, there is a main villain btw and...I'm not telling!). What I didn't like that much about the film was its first 20-30"" as pieces are put in place and we're getting our bearing and feeling. It's important for the film's pay-offs but it feels disjointed, and too somber/ heavy. I really didn't like the way that nemesis Brock Rumlow/ Crossbones was handled and dispatched. He's a villain from the comics worthy of far more screen time and respect. But other than these complaints (and a begrudging notion that ""The Winter Soldier"" is a slightly better movie) this movie is fantastic!

[WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. Do not read more if you don't want to know about surprising movie points before seeing it. These comments will reflect important character moments and/or highlights about them.]
Captain America: When Cap and Bucky are delivering Iron Man a major beatdown there's a point where you may gasp and mutter (as I did), ""Don't do it, Cap!"" when he looks like he's going to deal a death blow to IM. You need not worry.
Bucky/ the Winter Soldier: On team Cap of course. While Cap ultimately saves Bucky, true to the theme of loss, Bucky goes ""under the ice"" at movies end. Also, he remembers everything he's done and this lends his unwilling assassin a certain air of sadness. It's not happy being Bucky.
Iron Man: Tony finally learns how his parents died, and is surprised that it was Bucky who assassinated them. And what is worse, he finds that Cap know about how they died (though Cap didn't know it was Bucky). It's a pseudo-betrayal that cuts.
War Machine: On team Iron Man of course. Rhodey is cut down and left crippled by friendly fire. He's alive and convalescing by movie's end and still thinks the decision that he and IM made was the right one.
Black Panther: On team Iron Man, by default. BP fans rejoice! King T'Challa is all throughout this pic and keeps pace with Cap and Bucky. He is presented as a relentless hunter and is motivated by simple revenge but there is one point in the movie where he is stalled by a traitorous Black Widow. This is a fabulous introduction to one of my favorite Marvel characters and the film does him complete justice. He's an integral character to the film as he is an introduction to the African powerhouse nation of Wakanda and constantly poses danger to the hunted Bucky.
Sharon Carter/ Agent 13: On team Iron Man, by default of being a government operative. Or is she? She shares a kiss with Steve. Awkward!
Black Widow: On team Iron Man...and on Team Cap. While she fights on team IM she helps Cap out when she can. Great moment when she shows up at Peggy Carter's funeral and Cap assumes that she's there to convince him to get on board with the Sokovia accords. When she tells him that that's not why she's there he's confused and asks her, ""Then why are you hear?"" She says, ""Because you shouldn't be alone right now,"" and gives him a supportive hug. Tender moment.
Falcon: On team Cap. Falcon does more fancy flips and flops and his fighting style is so dynamic that it's really the coolest in the movie. And that alone is surprising.
The Vision: On team Iron Man. An incredibly powerful character he's learning what it is to be him, and to be human. When he walks through a wall into Wanda's room she scolds him, ""You know we've talked about this."" He also makes a mistake and both he and Tony didn't know that he could do that; that mistake was accidentally taking down War Machine.
Wanda Maximoff/ the Scarlet Witch: On team Cap. Ridiculously powerful, so much so that she plants Vision deep into the earth and is able to stop him, which he didn't know she could do, even while he was keeping her confined to quarters. There is nice development of a burgeoning romance between these two.
Hawkeye: On team Cap. Hawk takes down the Vision, buggers Iron Man, and goes mano-a-mano with Black Panther and he's given a great line at the end of the film when he's sitting in a max security penitentiary for criminals as he directs toward Stark, ""The great Futurist! Able to see the future and how the heroes will be locked up!""
Spider-man: On team Iron Man. Youthful to the point of distraction Spider-man features prominently in the main team-on-team fight. He is a bouncing, bounding ball of quipping energy and is funny. And young. And he won't shut up. Great intro here. It also doesn't hurt to see his awe at all the superheroes whom he idolizes, and that he gets beat up by Cap even as Cap throws mutual respect Spidey's way.
Ant-man: On team Cap. Their secret weapon and that secret is a big one, as he grows into Giant-man and causes all sorts of vexation for team Iron Man. They keep his character light and funny.",1462492800,,11170,4.697448979591837
7709648,5,B01D9EUNB4,"This surprisingly somber Marvel movie carries its weight in themes of ideals/ politics, relationships, and especially loss. ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to its name. Friends and partners get hurt, the Marvel cinematic universe is changed, there is nothing but superhero-on-superhero violence, and there are a few twists and surprises thrown in too. For anyone who has seen the multitude of trailers for this movie first and foremost you're going to marvel a bit at how much of those trailer clips occur in the first 20 minutes of this movie and secondly how much (wonderful) misdirection those edited clips will cause. Just as you expect one thing, something else happens or happens in a different context and this is great because the film offers several worthwhile surprises. But make no mistake: there is truly felt hurt and loss felt by us and our favorite on-screen heroes that is at the heart of this film, and an absolutely fantastic (and satisfying!) introduction to the Black Panther and a very good introduction to the (official) Marvel cinematic universe version of Spider-man.

Put it this way: people are still divided about BvS.  You either love it or hate it.

No ones gonna be divided on this movie.  Its everything it needed to be.

Its been said before and will always be said: the main reason the Marvel movies work is because the audience has had the time to become fully invested in the characters.  CA: CW introduces two new ones- Black Panther and Spiderman- and you're brought along for the ride with them.  Buckle up.

***MINI-SPOILERS AHEAD***
You know the plot: a year after the destruction of Sokovia in Age of Ultron, the Avengers are viewed as running rampant across the globe.  Many of the world governments come together to declare the Avengers are in dire need of supervision or else.  (FYI: this isn't a new idea; in the comics the Avengers operated under the auspices of the US Government.)  For reasons both pragmatic and personal, Stark agrees but along those same veins, Cap doesnt.  Both have valid arguments.  As the UN ratifies the Sokovia Accords, a terrorist attack leaves many delegates dead, including the King of Wakanda.  Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, is identified as the prime suspect and the hunt for him begins.  Bucky professes innocence to Cap, who supports his friend despite the pressure to bring him down and the lines are drawn.

Theres no real twists to this story; you can tell the whole time where its headed, but its a fun ride all the way.  Even the prologue scene is framed so that if you didn't intuit its significance right off the bat they still handed it to you on a platter almost immediately anyway.

In typical Marvel movie fashion, its the subplots and asides that made the movie shine.  Scarlet Witch and Visions budding relationship, Peter Parkers conversation with Tony Stark (and Marisa Tomei as a sexy MILF Aunt May!), Steve and Bucky reconnecting, even a seemingly throwaway line by Stark during the climactic fight at the end- all good stuff that put heart and soul into an action movie.

The villians arc also helps to sell the story.  F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote: show me a hero, and Ill write you a tragedy.  The same hold true for the bad guys; it matters more when its personal and nothings gonna change their course.  His entire history is inextricably linked to the whole- both the Avengers as well as Hydra- and makes for a good character arc in its own right.

The much anticipated big fight at the airport was pretty entertaining.  Everyone got their moments to shine in the scene, even Spiderman and Antman making big contributions to the cause.  Got a little choppy on the editing, but nothing too distracting.  As for the climactic fight between Bucky, Cap and Shellhead, it was satisfying both emotionally and visually, a dynamo of action and drama that brought the plot full circle.

Not that there aren't a few warts here.  The inciting incident at the beginning was clumsy and kinda dumb; I had a hard time believing anyone, even a rookie like Scarlet Witch, couldve made a mistake like hurling an explosive device INTO an occupied area, especially when if you let it explode in the air- where it already was- youd have been fine.  But plotwise that was simply the icing on the cake anyway.

I thought TChalla/Black Panthers intro couldve been built up a little more but they did a fine job of his development and juxtaposing him as an almost literal anti-Stark character: similar resources yet different personalities and motives.

The Peter Parker/Spiderman intro scene needed more explaining as to how Tony found him but you can roll with it.  Spiderman was everything he should be- an anxious kid in way over his head yet eager to prove himself to the adults, and talking too much the whole time to cover up his nervousness.  An excellent addition to the movie.

On a side note the Agent Carter story arc is also wrapped up, and given the ambiguous state of the tv show, it doesnt look like a good sign.

CA: CW is a great comic book movie and fantastically entertaining.  This is one you really need to see, not only for continuity but for the fun of it.

One question: hows Tony calling Spidey Underoos when in this world there weren't any superheroes to make Underoos from?  lol",1462492800,6,4423,4.680051813471502
7709651,5,B01D9EUNB4,"After the sloppy, undercooked mess that was Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War is a gourmet meal thatll cleanse your palate and leave you wondering when the heck DCs gonna get their act together.  Put it this way: people are still divided about BvS.  You either love it or hate it.

No ones gonna be divided on this movie.  Its everything it needed to be.

Its been said before and will always be said: the main reason the Marvel movies work is because the audience has had the time to become fully invested in the characters.  CA: CW introduces two new ones- Black Panther and Spiderman- and you're brought along for the ride with them.  Buckle up.

***MINI-SPOILERS AHEAD***
You know the plot: a year after the destruction of Sokovia in Age of Ultron, the Avengers are viewed as running rampant across the globe.  Many of the world governments come together to declare the Avengers are in dire need of supervision or else.  (FYI: this isn't a new idea; in the comics the Avengers operated under the auspices of the US Government.)  For reasons both pragmatic and personal, Stark agrees but along those same veins, Cap doesnt.  Both have valid arguments.  As the UN ratifies the Sokovia Accords, a terrorist attack leaves many delegates dead, including the King of Wakanda.  Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, is identified as the prime suspect and the hunt for him begins.  Bucky professes innocence to Cap, who supports his friend despite the pressure to bring him down and the lines are drawn.
