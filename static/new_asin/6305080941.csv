The crashing surf... majestic whales... furry otters... swaying kelp beds are absolutely gorgeous. It is one of the most relaxing videos I've ever seen... and I always feel good after I watch it. The quality of the entire presentation is excellent. (I'm not sure what ""Shea"" is talking about in his review - maybe he just got a defective copy) The colors are bright and vivid, the images sharp, and the slow motion is wonderful. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves the true ocean experience!",1154822400,2,613,4.63302752293578
7882579,5,6305080941,"I don't get why this other reviewer found this dvd so distasteful; I found this to be a sensational dvd.  This is unlike any of my other nature dvds.  The manta ray sequence took my breath away.  If you are a nature dvd fan, a new age music fan, or just an ocean lover, this dvd it for you!",1033689600,4,290,3.8813559322033897
7882580,1,6305080941,I went looking for the dramamine after watching this DVD for just 5  minutes.  It flickers. It's pixelated. It's full of DVD artifacts. The slow  motion scenes are herky-jerky; more of a frame-by-frame than true slow  motion.  Don't waste your money on this one unless you enjoy getting  headaches in back of your eyeballs.,965606400,5,323,4.888888888888889
