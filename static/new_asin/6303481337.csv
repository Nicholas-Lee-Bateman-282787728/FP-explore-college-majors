7848377,5,6303481337,"ANY of the Richard Scarry videos are so well-loved and often-watched by my kids, it would be hard NOT to recommend them.  We inherited so many videos from family members, I kept the technology--it's actually more kid-friendly.  They can run videos by themselves and throw them around with pretty much no damage to the tapes.  DVDs on the other hand, I would definitely not buy, they are so easily scratched and damaged by kids.  Besides, VCR tapes like this are cheap, too.  I was very happy with the price--even with shipping it was so affordable.  Very cute video.",1380585600,,566,4.724489795918367
7848378,5,6303481337,"This is a very good video. I relly liked the story of Grouchy Mr Gromply. I am planing on getting this video for chrismas. I also like the story Patrick Pig Learns to Talk and the title story, The Best Birthday Present Ever was funny, too.  This is one of my favorite Richard Scarry videos.  Charlie, age 8.
