8400707,1,B003N5VOT0,"Same as the other reviewers, I borrowed this from a local library. If you're even considering buying it, DON'T! I couldn't even recommend it if it was free. Yeah, that bad!

As someone else stated, this is a very basic, no frills DVD. The sound guy sits behind the instruction the entire time she does her workout. He checks his phone and looks bored waiting for the session to finish. As if this wasn't amateurish enough, the camera has trouble following the instruction. At other times, the person in the back room has a hand or head that flashes in front of the camera during the workout.

This workout is extremely hard to follow. You would need to watch it several times in order to anticipate the next move. And the production value was obviously less than a shoestring budget.

To me, this DVD is the equivalent of a bootleg movie in quality. Pay a few dollars but don't expect a whole lot. The fact that someone is trying to sell it for anything over $5 is a total travesty.",1437350400,,982,4.444444444444445
8400708,3,B003N5VOT0,"did this dvd one time,rented from library. it seems as though it was filmed at a continuing education course. i liked getting right into the routine and felt the cues easy to follow and quick and to the point.  i liked that she included variety and worked in various planes of motion.  i had only muscle soreness the following 2 days,but no joint or tendon pain. i can see why she would want to charge so much with her education and development of the routine;however, $50 really is too much for a work out dvd.  i know nothing about kettlebells or appropriate kb technique so i can't comment on that.",1349395200,,601,4.445454545454545
8400709,1,B003N5VOT0,"I, fortunately, got this from my inter-library loan before buying it!
First- the production is very basic- the audio is hard to hear and it's obviously done in a hotel meeting room. at one point two guys come in and hang the sign behind the women after she has already started her routine. Off to the side is a bored appearing guy who sits next to the audio board THE WHOLE TIME so he is always off to the side as you're trying to watch the women working out! He actually starts reading a book or something near the end of the video.

It's one work out from start to finish- and if you don't know how to do the exercise before she starts, you've got to pick it up as you go and don't expect any preliminaries or additional video of how to do it.  SO- if you've already know the moves and how to do it- it might be good for you but the production values or so poor that I couldn't stand trying to watch this!

So still looking for a good Kettlebell workout video.",1327190400,,962,4.1063829787234045
