2691673,5,B000KJOQJC,"I have been doing Step aerobics for years and have a slight knee problem.
Cathe's Low Impact Circuit is absolutely amazing with three segments of aerobic step workout which increase my heart rate considerably. Each aerobic step segment also consists of low-impact cardio blasts towards the end of each segment which increases the heart rate even further. These step-aerobic segments are followed by strength training segments which incorporate compound movements which keeps the heart rate up continuously. One of the strength training segments uses a variety of push-ups which I simply love. As usual Cathe's cueing is excellent. The workout also has 8 minutes of abs which exercises your core and one can feel the pain the next day. There is also a bonus 9 minutes cardio segment at the end which I never fail to do. The DVD also has premixes so that one can choose whatever they want to do.
I love Cathe's workouts and I also have her Lo Max and Imax2+Cardio&weights which are all amazing.
Throughout this workout my knees do not feel the pain and I still get an amazing intensely cardiovascular workout.",1206576000,,1107,4.8936170212765955
2691674,5,B000KJOQJC,"Cathe is THE BEST workout instructor ever!!! I am so glad I found her for body building, step & cardio!! (I also do power, vinyasa yoga and wanted to add some cross training cardio and weights to it) Her workout's are superior and like mining gold! This is my first step dvd I've ever done and my gosh is it fun and challenging! The music is amazing and motivating (this is one of many of her trademarks with her workout's), the choreography is simple enough so as not to be confusing to a new stepper but very creative and challenging so it is incredibly fun and sweat producing for a beginner and intermediate. This is one amazing workout and I can't get enough of her!! She is now my go to instructor for my cardio and weights!! AWESOME!!!",1205798400,,742,4.384057971014493

2691676,4,B000KJOQJC,"Love Cathe, the music and the workout.  Wish she would cue for right and left, however.  Part one was a great workout but I can't get through cardio 2 - I am a bit of a klutz - and just did the other pieces.  I was tired - who knows when I'll get to cardio 3 but we all have to have goals.",1202688000,4,289,3.5555555555555554

2691678,5,B000KJOQJC,"I tried this DVD because I wanted to have a low impact workout to do on days that I don't run.  Cathe [...] the first time, but she actually made it fun!  After a week of doing this workout, I already have more muscle definition.  The music is fun and Cathe keeps you motivated the whole 71 mintues!!",1180483200,,300,4.137931034482759
2691679,5,B000KJOQJC,"Cathe has delivered another winner here, especially for low impact people like myself.  This workout is about 70 minutes long but it's tons of fun and just flies by.  The music is great and really adds to the fun factor. For this workout you will need a step, dumbells, a barbell and a resistance band.  Dumbells can be easily used if you do not have a barbell or band.

You start with a fun warmup, then you will proceed into the first of three circuit cycles.  Each circuit contains a step routine, a step blast, a compound exercise and assorted upper body work.  The step choreography is all low impact though one could certainly add power moves if they choose, plus it's fun and interesting without being too difficult to master.  The toning work is unique, you will see a lot of resistance band work such as lat pulldowns, scapular retractions, double arm rows and more traditional exercises such as lying tricep extensions, kickbacks, bicep curls and several varieties of pushups among other exercises. The weights used are more light to moderate as opposed to heavy, which is a nice change. Once all the circuits are completed, you will do short ab routine before the cooldown and stretch.

This has become one of my favorite Cathe workouts ever, and I have a small handful of them.  I give this one five stars, even with all the pushups.  Highly recommended for those who like circuit workouts.",1180310400,19,1402,4.685714285714286
2691680,5,B000KJOQJC,"I love this workout.  Not only is it very challenging, the music and choreography are great.

I do not think this is a good choice for the intermediate exerciser.

It is definitely advanced.

Cathe does some unique and effective bicep work, using the barbell and the resistance band.  You will feel it for sure.

The DVD also has lots of workout options.

I love this workout -- time just flies and after you have completed the workout, you will know you've worked hard.",1180051200,5,470,4.590361445783133
2691681,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is a wonderful workout from Cathe!  As a recent Cathe convert, I am just begining her workouts, and this one was so much fun.  The workout will make you sweat, and provides a great cardio as well as weight work.  Cathe is encouraging and cues very well.  Don't get me wrong, the workout is challenging, no doubt there!  This will will remain in my dvd rotation because I can't wait to do it again!",1174694400,4,402,4.306666666666667
2691682,5,B000KJOQJC,"I LOVE this workout. The choreography is simple, yet fun, and with the blasts you get an excellent low-impact yet high intensity workout. Many of the strength training moves are compound exercises, which makes the work out both effective and efficient. I wish I could say Cathe's low impact workouts are ""easier"" than her other workouts - but she finds a way to work you to the max and challenge you every time.",1167955200,13,411,4.6438356164383565
2691683,5,B000KJOQJC,"Love this Cathe dvd, great work out.  I used to be a hard core step aerobics fan and with age, just not there anymore.  But this dvd gives me the wonderful workout without the pounding on my knees.  You definitely work up a sweat and struggle with some of the exercises, which is what you want.  If you don't struggle some, you're not working hard enough.",1490832000,2,355,4.333333333333333

2691687,5,B000KJOQJC,"I love Cathe's exercise dvd's, and this is no exception.  A solid half hour of butt and leg barre work.",1484784000,,103,4.15
2691688,5,B000KJOQJC,Another great Cathe workout.  All her workouts are fun and she talks you through the process.  This video is great for toning legs.  Can be challenging but in a good way.  I definitely recommend!!,1484352000,,196,4.676470588235294
2691689,2,B000KJOQJC,"I'm very disappointed with this DVD, which was advertised as low-impact cardio.  First of all, there were far too many moves I couldn't do, and I found myself having to improvise a lot because I have painful arthritis in my knees.  Second, when I buy a cardio DVD it's because I want to do cardio, not strength training.  I'd return this if I could.",1484006400,,349,4.421875
2691690,5,B000KJOQJC,"I purchased this workout a few months ago, but tried it for the first time today. For some background on me, I have been working out to Cathe DVDs for over 10 years, in addition to some others (Chalene Johnson, Shaun T, Jeri Love). According to my annual wellness check-ups, my fitness level is ""excellent."" I am 43 years old and do high intensity workouts about 5 times per week. Man oh man, Cathe does not disappoint with this one. It is super high intensity in both cardio and toning. During each set when I was about ready to give up and take a break, I couldn't decide if my fatigue was more cardio or muscle related. It seemed to be both equally, which is what you want!

This is not for the faint of heart and is clearly aimed toward the advanced exerciser.  That is not to say a beginner or intermediate exerciser should not try it. While Cathe doesn't offer modifications (she never does in any of her workouts) you can use your judgement on when to take it easier.  If you can't finish a set, march in place or walk briskly around the room. If the lunges bother your knees, don't sink down so low. If the burpees bother your knees, do standing toe touches or knee raises. Just do your best. As always, Cathe's cueing and tips are spot on and her personality is warm and professional.  She is top notch in my book!",1481932800,4,1323,4.32258064516129

2691696,4,B000KJOQJC,What a great workout!  Kicked my butt!  (But still do-able.  You don't have to be in top athletic shape to finish the workout.),1471219200,,127,4.434782608695652
2691697,5,B000KJOQJC,"I've used Cathe's workouts before, I own her ""Butts & Guts"" and it's a tough lower body workout for sure! Cathe is always tough but easy to follow, and this dvd workout is no exception. I am currently healing a stress fracture (metatarsal/foot) & can't run, so I bought this dvd to rotate into my home-bound workouts until I can run again. It is a solid cardio workout, for sure! I don't have the ""sliders"" she uses, so I modify slightly, otherwise I do the workout as is, and it leaves me in a full-out sweat, and I'm in excellent shape! Great for those days when you need high intensity cardio but don't have time to hit the gym or if you can't run. Please note, it is low impact, but not low intensity. I definitely recommend this dvd, I'll be using it long after I'm healed and back to running - great cross training!",1470614400,2,821,4.303225806451613
2691698,5,B000KJOQJC,"I love this workout. The movements really target the muscles and I see results. I'm slowly working up to completing the entire workout. Innovative moves and expert cuing from Cathe. I love that is is low impact, too. There are pre-mixes available if you don't have the full 70 minutes to workout.",1469836800,,296,4.711538461538462
2691699,4,B000KJOQJC,Catherine Frederick videos are top notch. Waiting to see where she takes us in her next series,1468800000,,94,4.588235294117647
2691700,5,B000KJOQJC,recovering from a serious leg injury...this was the motivation I needed! Even though I cannot do everything...I can modify and get a GREAT workout!!,1467504000,,148,5.208333333333333
2691701,4,B000KJOQJC,I love it! Very challenging workout with clear instructions,1467158400,,59,5.666666666666667
2691702,4,B000KJOQJC,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  It is low impact to a certain extent (i.e. no jumping) but the many squats and lunges could easily hurt your knees, especially since there aren't any modifications for those who aren't as advanced.  This workout is essentially a combination of HiiT intervals and strength exercises; the weighted portions are meant to be ""rest"" periods but to me they were more cardiovascular than the HiiTs themselves.  To put it in context I love XTrain and while I get winded a few times with those this video had me praying for it to end.

Every set is done twice: one high intensity cardio blast and one weighted exercise.  I personally could not get through most of the moves requiring gliding discs one time, let alone twice when in combination with a cardio HiiT.  Think intense mountain climbers using the discs, spiderman crunches with the discs, and pulling yourself forwards and backwards using the discs and doing push-ups each time you move each way... very difficult and NOT for intermediate exercisers.  I consider myself high intermediate/advanced and I honestly dread doing the entire routine; I opt for the first 10 rounds without repetition and that is enough in itself.

Despite my reservations I am reaching for the DVD more repeatedly for the Express Premix because it is effective and tolerable when you know you only have to get through one set.  I can't say it's as fun as Cathe's XTrain series - I love them - and I can't say I enjoy this workout since I don't.  But it burns calories and increases strength easily so for those reasons alone I'd cautiously recommend it despite its problems and not very inspiring music.

I LOVE Cathe but this was not a favorite.",1462406400,10,1712,4.75
2691703,5,B000KJOQJC,"Amazing cardio DVD that works you hard, but then that's to be expected, isn't it? I love that it's low impact but incredibly challenging. There are plenty of pre-mix options and Cathe is such a great trainer that she somehow gets you through it. This DVD is in a regular rotation for my workouts every week now.",1462233600,2,311,4.473684210526316
2691704,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is a great workout!  It mainly focuses on legs but there is a bit of light weight training for the upper body in the beginning along with some abdominal exercises towards the end.  After a fairly long warm up (roughly 10 minutes) Cathe proceeds to target the biceps, triceps and shoulders using 5 pound weights.  I thought that would be too easy since I've been doing a long of strength work - wrong.  She does a lot of reps so 5's were a perfect fit (for me, at least).  She then hits the lower body from all angles and you definitely feel it; in fact, I was already feeling it during the warm up!  I couldn't keep up with her and had to stop too many times to count.

While she does do some plies and ballet moves this was more intense and athletic than barre routines I've done in the past.  I love Suzanne Bowen and her programs but Turbo Barre is much different than most barre DVDs such as Suzanne's BarreAmped.  Cathe throws in all sorts of moves that I had never previously encountered; there was less focus on traditional exercises done in first and second positions and more on working the legs with calisthenics.  That's not to say that Turbo Barre won't create lean and strong muscles, it just takes another approach.

Cathe is encouraging, pleasant and professional.  All you'll need is a chair, mat, light weights and a firewalker band/loop.

This DVD is wonderful for days when you want to get a good workout but don't want to sweat too much and/or need to take a break from higher intensity routines.  Considering that I'm already sore it gets the job done!  I'll be alternating this with Cathe's strength, metabolic and HiiT DVDs and think it's a great addition (I recently discovered Cathe and have already become an addict).  Highly recommend!",1459296000,,1767,4.561904761904762

I have a few of Cathe's DVD's and this one is the most challenging so far.  It's low impact but high intensity.  Her moves are very rapid, even when using weights.  I wish the pace was just a tad slower.  There is no modifier but I just modify myself by moving at a slower pace or using lighter weights.  I love Cathe's energy.  She is positive and fun.  This is definitely a more advanced workout.",1454976000,,435,4.219512195121951
2691707,5,B000KJOQJC,I love Barre workouts but wasn't sure what to expect from Cathe.  Use many of her weight workouts but thought this would be out of her element - pleasantly surprised.

2691712,5,B000KJOQJC,"I LOVE this workout!  Had never heard of Cathe before (which now seems surprising as I see how long this trainer has been out there and how well known she is, guess I've been sheltered...).  :)  At any rate, heard about her through a fitness group I'm part of... was curious enough about it to watch the utube video on this one (and since several of her other workouts).  I have a bad knee... have had surgery to repair as much as they could, but my workouts now have to avoid a lot of weights and lunges, etc.  This workout looked like something that would work for the most part, and easy to modify for the rest (as in shallow knee bends, not deep).  The workout is AWESOME and totally works for someone who wants a great workout (lots of sweat), lots of burning (the good kind!), and easy on the knees!  It's a long workout, which I was skeptical about at first, but have to say...  this trainer makes the time go by quickly!  (and I'm normally a - get me in and out in 30 minutes kind of girl).  This one... the time goes by surprisingly fast and the workout is so fun and effective, that you just keep going.  Definitely one of my home workout favorites!  :)",1437350400,,1163,4.236363636363636

I do think that it is well done and very professional.  The music is good, great compared to most other workouts.  Cathe's instruction is excellent - you totally understand the strength moves and what you are supposed to be doing.  I really enjoyed the first step sequence, liked the second sequence, and was ready to rip the DVD out of the player and hurl it at the wall on the third sequence.  Cathe's step instruction is what I find lacking in this workout.  She cues just fine, if you define ""cueing"" as telling you the name of the move.  But, she does not explain the move or build up to the more complex steps.  She just seems to assume that you'll know what to do.  And, if you are long-time Cathe exerciers, you probably will.  If not, you may have some problems figuring out the moves.  And, I don't feel like I should have to practice a simple step sequence to get the steps down.",1434499200,,1568,4.257627118644068

When I first purchased it,I probably would have given it 5 stars,as it really does work your lower body and being low impact,it helped me stay in shape after several injuries. Since my lower half isy trouble spot,I am always hunting down great lower body dvd's and since purchasing Turbo Barre,I have discovered Tonique,which is by far the best series for toning the lower body. I even sold Turbo Barre but then decided to give it another shot and reordered it. I've tried several times to use it but find myself dreading the workout as soon as I begin. It is an excellent toning workout but so dull when I now own countless other lower body dvd's to compare it to. I do love the core segment and find myself using that as an add on to other workouts.

2691728,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is a great workout to do if you don't want to jump around.  I have done it so often, I am able to watch tv and do this at the same time.

There is a good warm up section with leg lifts and arm sways.  Then, you do arm exercises with light weights.  I use 5 pounds.  You can use 10 pounds if you want a harder burn.

You will need an exercise band for some arm and leg exercises, which will be challenging.

There is a long leg lift section that is done standing up, which is actually easier on the knees than doing them on the knees (see my review of the Tracy Anderson Method).  I use a rolling table (on carpet) in lieu of the bar because I don't have that much room in my small exercise area but you can even use a chair for the exercises.

Your workout is complete with some lunges and leg lifts.  There is also a long ab section.  The music in the stretch section is so relaxing, like magical soothing flutes.

Cathe is motivating and upbeat, like working out with your best friend.  Two years ago, I did this dvd almost everyday for the entire winter and did not gain any weight despite a high carb diet and not much additional exercise.  I was abler to still wear size 18 pants from Justice (size 18 for girls = 37.5 inch hips).",1416182400,2,1240,4.070247933884297
2691729,5,B000KJOQJC,I bought this for my mom who is struggling with her knees.  It is low impact but it is not an easy workout.  I'm a fitness trainer and even I was sweating when I was done.  Love it.,1414886400,,181,3.710526315789474
2691730,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is my favorite barre dvd right now, the workout goes with music beat which helps me push through pain and do more reps, though I have to stop to stretch more often than they do. I was feeling all my muscles from my back all the way to my feet the next day, this is my first Cathe workout, I love how she trains with encouragement, but without yelling. I have to use low impact workouts because of weak knee's, so any other leg and ab workouts that fit that criteria would be great to hear about in the comment section. I like  the ab work but I wish it was longer. I use a chair and it works fine. this is a tough barre workout, so remember to engage your core, she doesn't mention it much, it does really help when up on balls of feet to stabilize the body. I am going to use this twice a week for now in between tall step workouts to have some fun every week. even though this is hard to finish I wish it was a little longer, it goes by so fast.

Afterburn is a serious, nearly hour workout, that really gets the metabolism pumped. I am always a sweaty mess after this...and the forward leaning lunges burn the butt for a couple of days!",1402272000,,337,4.524590163934426
2691744,4,B000KJOQJC,"I love Cathe's workout videos and I own more that I care to admit. Unfortunately due to a back injury this last year I have been limited to the type of workouts I can do. This means I have to be super careful with weights and cardio due the movement patterns that aggravate my spine.
I started Barre workouts a few moths ago, when I felt like I had worn out all other possibilities, yes I was that blind to the benefits of this fantastic form of workout. I have amassed a bit of a collection over that last few months and have become quite strong in the movements. So I went into Cathe's workout thinking this was going to be a light day barre workout as this is not exactly Cathe's forte.
Was I wrong. I did not feel as challenged as I do during Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre, but I this is definitely not a light day workout.
I love the arm section, which truly showcases Cathe's professionalism. I also like the impression that Cathe and her crew give, which made me feel more at ease, because I was not trying to compare my flexibility to that of former dancers. Cathe as always is right on target with her cues and counts. She has a warm personality that makes you feel like your working out with a friend.
I did not give this DVD 5 stars as I was disappointed with the ab section. There seems to be little "" teaching "" in this section.
If you are familiar with pilates you should be fine, but even in advanced pilates dvds the instructors provide constant reminders on technique.",1402272000,2,1484,4.303571428571429

2691746,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is by far the most intense -- and AWESOME-- low impact workout I've ever done, and I have yet to do the full length DVD yet. Cathe offers great pre-mixes, a few of which are approximately 30 minutes, so that's very encouraging! At least I can finish those shorter versions.  One note: I strained my achilles tendon doing a HIIT workout dvd (taught by a different instructor) a couple of years ago, and it still occasionally gets aggravated. Walking on a treadmill is unbearable, but I can walk outside or on a trail. I do Afterburn once or a twice a week to make sure I remember what it feels like to sweat. And you will sweat with this workout! Cathe is one of the best! Back in the day, I used to do her power step workouts.",1396742400,3,731,4.258992805755396
2691747,4,B000KJOQJC,"I just wished you could do the video with a chair instead of that barre!  I've watched the video, but haven't been able to exercise to it yet because I need a barre in order to exercise to the video!",1396569600,,199,3.975
2691748,5,B000KJOQJC,"I was looking for a challenge in my workout and Afterburn has more than filled the bill!  I have yet to do all 10 intervals for one full workout,as this is a workjout I will have to build up to.  Instead I use the premixes which do 5 at a time, or 10 singles.  The intervals have one cardio section followed by one weight section (supposedly to catch your breath), and then is repeated before going to the next interval.  The weight sections are often compound exercises using both upper and lower body.  With Afterburn, I feel like I'm not only getting a great cardio workout, but also a bonus toning routine.  It doesn't replace my weight workouts, but allows me to trim them down if I need to, since Afterburn has a lot of squats and shoulder moves in it.  Even without the weights, I feel like I get a great leg workout with the  air squats, lunges, and mountain climbers, which also keeps my heart rate high!  Again, Cathe delivers another energized cardio/toning workout!",1396310400,,977,4.505681818181818
2691749,5,B000KJOQJC,Cathe is different.  Her routines are solid and give a great challenge.  I am so glad that I invested in this DVD as it allows me to do barre at home without stressing to get to a gym.  It also has music options (voice plus music; or only voice) and we can toggle through segments of the video -- which is great when you need a booster or are short on time.,1395014400,2,357,3.9305555555555554
2691750,2,B000KJOQJC,"I might have missed it, but I do not remember seeing in the description that about half of the exercises are done with discs on a wooden floor.

2691751,5,B000KJOQJC,"I love this workout!  I've been doing Cathe's tapes for several years and have always gotten a great work out.  You get what you put into it, and she delivers every time for me.

This particular tape is something new for me, and though new, it gives me an exceptional workout.  I ache in such a god way, and in new places.

I like the low impact workouts, they still deliver.  I am no spring chicken so these are terrific for me.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good stimulating, break a sweat workout without all that jumping and running in place.  One always adjusts the different moves to their own pace and bend only as deep as one can.  You still get a workout!",1393977600,4,681,4.217054263565892

2691755,5,B000KJOQJC,"I just did this dvd for the first time today. LOVE IT! Just what I was looking for, a great workout that was easy on my back (unlike the Insanity workouts). My heart rate stayed high from start to finish and I burned a lot of calories (per HRM). I am not new to exercise dvd's and have collected many over the years. This one though is a new fave and will join the rotation. If you are on the fence about buying this due to the low impact I would say don't think twice. Cathe does not let up just because it's low impact. You will sweat and you will love it!",1388102400,6,558,3.9469026548672566
2691756,5,B000KJOQJC,"I never thought low impact would be so hard.  I still haven't quite been able to finish it after trying 4 times.  Cathe is my absolute favorite and her videos are more difficult than any other fitness expert I've tried and also in my opinion great for women's trouble spots.  I also have Cathe's Cardio Leg Blast (which is also awesome) and Cathe's Circuit Blast (again awesome) but this one for me is the hardest.  Which translates to the most rewarding.  Might be difficult if you have bad knees, she does lots of squatting and lunging (as usual). Each interval is repeated 2 times, and I believe each one finishes with plank type exercises also for maximum burn.  I recommend this if you are trying to take your fitness to a more advanced level.  To sum it up, I LOVE it, and so so happy I bought it!",1387584000,,803,4.385135135135135
2691757,4,B000KJOQJC,"I am at an intermediate fitness level and Cathe has a good reputation for being tough but effective, so I gave this one a try. The exercises are good. She proves that low impact does not necessarily mean low intensity! She got my heart rate up and I felt a nice burn at the end of some of the reps.

She is excellent with her cueing and is encouraging without at all seeming patronizing - she acts like she's getting a good workout in too! Near the end of a rough set, she'll encourage you to not only not give up, but also go lower or farther or harder.

Someone else had posted a hint that you can use paper plates if you don't have the special sliders you need for some of the exercises. I have wood floors and small feet - the paper plates worked great. You can also adapt those exercises to a non-low-impact version if you don't have the sliders and don't have joint issues or a lot of extra weight. You do need a set of dumbbells though. 3-8 pounds I am guessing (I used 5 - it was do-able but really tough for the last few reps sometimes)

I did not like two things:
1. There are premixes you can choose from but not any description of what they include, not in the intro and not on the back of the dvd (there were no materials inside the case on what I got)
2. Cardio Supersets Extreme is a little over 60 minutes of cardio supersets that does not include any step segments, including a vigorous warm-up and a nice little stretch at the end. The thing is, at the half way point, it goes back to round you did before, just repeats them. It is a little harder the second time around when I'm feeling it already; but it bored me a bit. I might go ahead and get a stepper b/c there is a premix of about the same length that does not repeat segments but requires a step.",1387065600,10,1773,4.1037463976945245

2691759,5,B000KJOQJC,"I am in love with this DVD!!  I work out regularly, but I hit a plateau and I needed something to shake things up a bit, and shake it does!!  My right leg was wobbling all over the place from the workload of standing on it, but it's a great wobbling ;)

As promised, it's low impact .  It also isn't cardiovascularly strenuous, but that's great for days when you're feeling tired, but you don't want to miss your workout and you want it to still be a good one.

It's a bit on the longer side at 75 minutes, but it would be really easy to skip one or more of the sections (e.g., arms, abs) if you were short on time.",1385164800,11,615,3.967479674796748

I went to a physician that recommended no ""jumping"" exercises. I changed my routine to low impact and it helped tremendously. I am always looking for programs/workouts that are high intensity, but low impact. They are difficult to find, but this video seems to be a great addition to my collection. I definitely cannot do all the reps yet, but that gives me a challenge to work toward, which is a good motivator for me.

I was sooooooo happy to find this one.  Sure there are some moves I have to modify (no deep bends), but overall I feel this has helped decrease my knee pain and continue to feel strong & healthy.  Cathe gives excellent instructions- you are never guessing what she is doing or what is next.  What I love most about her is I don't have to keep my eyes glued to the screen, allowing me to focus on my workout.

2691765,4,B000KJOQJC,"General Background on the Low Impact Series:

First off, let me say I enjoy the entire Low Impact Series immensely and definitely recommend it.  As a whole it is very joint friendly - great for bodies that need a little TLC or pregnant/post-postpartum moms.  It definitely keeps it intense, but low-impact.

On to Cardio Supersets:

This video consists of several drills grouped in sets of two and repeated twice. It moves at a nice pace and keeps things interesting.  None of the exercises are too demanding or difficult.  All are low-impact.  Often she mentions modifications as she explains each movement.  The music is peppy but not annoying.  A good little work-out for some intense but not overly demanding cardio.

Tips:  Cathe counts out how many to do of each exercise and has her crew do them with her, but if you wanted to get crazy, you could just go all out as fast as you could and try to get as many done in the same amount of time she does them.  Likewise, she uses fairly light weight (or often no weight) and I found that to increase intensity I like to wear hand-weights or wrist weights or to increase the amount of weight I use for the weighted exercises.

Pros: Low Impact, but intense.

Cons: Short.  But there are fun premixes to make it longer (or shorter if you are pressed for time). Also, it is a little easier than a high impact intense cardio, so if that is what you are looking for, you will need to make some modifications

Intensity Factor: 6.5 out of 10 (8 out of 10 if you add enough ""extras"" such as weighed vest, gloves, ankle/wrist weights, or just heavier weights when she uses weights)

Recommended Fitness Level: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced (with modifications)",1377561600,8,1705,4.6644295302013425

2691779,5,B000KJOQJC,This is an absolute favorite. There is not a single move that I don't like. It's also one that anyone can do. I must have 60 workout dvd's at home and currently I do this one the most. I think Barre workouts really change your body and are fun. Cathe works your arms too in the beginning. She starts with 5 lb weights and tells you to move up when you're not challenged anymore. I have moved up to 8's except the lateral shoulder raises. Ouch. There are a lot of parts where you'll say ouch but you will see a change head to toe. I have worked out faithfully for over 30 years and this one has really leaned up my lower half more than any other workout. You will be able to crack an egg on your bottom ;),1364947200,20,704,4.0
2691780,2,B000KJOQJC,"I work out in my carpeted basement, so unfortunately this DVD is almost worthless.

I own a lot of barre/ballet exercise DVD'S which provide me with more than enough srength training and some cardio; however, I only had one true cardio workout where you constantly use hand weights. This DVD does it all as far as a non-stop low impact workout! There are quite a few exercises using the gliding discs so I ended up buying a pair. Cathe uses much heavier dumbbells; I use eight pound ones.

My quads are burning, my abs are tight, my arms are really worked ... but for the first time, I have absolutely no lower back pain, my (large) chest isn't bouncing everywhere, and my knees and ankles feel okay since it is not jumping - totally low impact.
I also have carpal tunnel so I use 2-pound weight bands instead of 8-pound bells (omg) and pushup blocks, but its still awesome.  Great workout, nice cool down stretch, Cathe is feminine and fun and encouraging (she gives you really good tips)

MODS -- I don't have discs, so I break things down into two steps, like I step-out-left/arms-up,  back-to-center/arms-down,  step-out-right/arms-up, etc. to not injure my knees or back.
For the mountain climbers I just bring my feet in about half way, than bend my body for the crab walk so it doesn't hurt my knees.
The aerobic step series is a little tough on my knees and balance, I just slow down the steps at half pace when I need to, but it cuts down the workout.  But these step moves are really nice extending whole body / torso / arms, you don't need to get aggressive and still feel exhilarated.",1361836800,14,1228,4.529411764705882

Cathe's Afterburn really does drive you and it is hard (and I had already been working out 5x a week for over a year when I got this video). It is all worth it, however, this works me and the sense of accomplishment I feel when I am done is well worth it. Cathe is encouraging and knowing that she is in her 50s (I think) makes me know I can do it too. You may not be able to do all of the exercises in the video or all of the reps, but do as much/many as you can until the day you can do it all. She does not offer modifications for most moves, which is a shame, but as long as you do what you can to the extent you can, and find a way to keep moving during the ones you can't do (be sure you don't do anything that hurts you) and then follow along with what you can, I think there is a benefit. I really do like her workouts and have about all of the ones in the low-impact series.",1357257600,24,1045,3.7545454545454544

It's quite challenging even for an advanced exerciser like myself but offers the opportunity to do a ""quickie,"" because the primary workout is only 30 minutes but you can add on the 21-minute step extra, which is also a low-impact workout. This one, like her other recent low-impact workouts, proves that you don't have to jump and pound the joints in order to burn calories.

I work at my own pace on some of the intervals and modify certain exercises to a lower level.  But I was still fighting to get through the video.  Afterburn is not for the faint of heart, but I can't wait to do it again and try some of her other routines.

My only issue is that I bought this on Amazon On Demand so I don't have another DVD to add to my collection.

Another thing that I like is that she work the upper body very hard too.

There's not a lot of annoying equipment; you'll need just dumbbells and sliding discs (I use a set of sliding furniture movers from Walmart a set of 8 was just $8), she also uses small dixie cups but they aren't necessary.

This is exactly what I was looking for. I almost think it is more difficult than all the jumping around. Using your legs to push the gliding discs move really expends alot of energy. I use paper plates for the gliding discs as suggested by another review and they work just fine. Low impact does not mean this is an easy DVD, it simply means no jumping but no less challenging in my opinion. I love all the premixes, her DVD's are usually more exspensive but you get several different workouts in one DVD which adds variety.

I think this is good, something to use with your other barre workouts for a good change. Cathe doesn't waste a lot of time setting exercises up with is a complaint I have always had with The Bar Method, perhaps because this is an advanced workout.

One great thing also about Cathe is that she really thinks about the workouts. She has a great ability to take something basic and make it her own, and I appreciate it. She's creative and she's tough.

Another solid workout from this instructor. The usual non-annoying backup crew, decent cues, non-intrusive music with a beat, high production quality with excellent camera work.

I substituted higher impact moves since I do not have/use the gliding discs.  I believe you may get an even more intensive workout with the discs since I can see that you would really have to use your core on top of everything else but regular impact (jumping etc.) works also to give you a good workout.

Camera work excellent.  Overall DVD production quality good as usual.  Does not have option for music only which I think every workout DVD should have (better yet music and cues only) but very few ever do.

Instructor and backup folk are non-annoying.  Instructor gives decent cues, a few tips on form, and encouragement mostly only at the end when things get tough, as should be.  Moves are simple but effective.  I can see the sliders are a good idea to be easier on the joints but still keep the moves tough enough to be cardio.  That said, I do not own any and I am on a carpet anyway.  I went high impact instead e.g., instead of doing a sliding ski move I did a scissor jump type move and got a good workout still.  Step bonus workout is very good --- the step is used more to make the moves tougher rather than more complex which is a must for me.  I do not get bored so much as want to get maximum calorie burn from every move.  Having to learn complex choreography and do many repeats before actually being able to get a good workout would be a total ""no"" for me.

Most women cannot do what we often call the man's pushups, but she and her crew knock them out as if they were as easy as walking.  I think that even if you do half the workout you will see results.  It moves fast and there are a lot of lunges and squats; so be prepared.  Your legs will be worked to near failure and you probably can't do it the next day, nor should you. I think it's an every other day or two workout.  But it's worth aspiring to because it works the entire body, especially the larger muscles (legs and glutes) and there is where you get the Afterburn.

2691813,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is the toughest of Cathe's Low Impact Series.  It's awesome.  Once again, Miss Cathe has proven beyond the shadow of doubt that low impact can mean high intensity.  This workout consists of seven routines; you alternate a low impact cardio move with a compound move using light weights.  You do each two moves two times through.  Cardio endurance is the focus here.

This workout combines HiiT(high intensity interval training), with metabolic weight training (high reps using light weights and short rest periods).

Why I love this workout:

**It's a killer and it's nonstop movement.  I feel so energized and accomplished after I've finished.  I'm not even close to using the same weights as Cathe.  Who would have thought that little 8 pound or 5 pound dumb bells could feel so heavy?

**It works your core with planks, pushups, mountain climbers and burpees.  I have a love/hate relationship with these exercises.  I hate doing them, but I love how they tone my core.

**The fun variety of exercises.  You'll do spidermans with the gliding discs, you'll do lunges with shoulder raises and you'll do air squats.  Even if you don't like a particular exercise, there's enough variety that you'll find some exercises that you like.

**The music has a driving beat, which really helps get me through a tough workout like this.  I was pleasantly surprised since I usually don't like Cathe's taste in workout music.

There are some things to note about this workout.  I don't consider them to be negatives since I so love this workout.

The things to note:

**The lunges could tweak your knees, while the pushups and planks could tweak your wrists.  Cathe doesn't really give any modifications for these exercises, so you're on your own.  You could lunge less deeply, or just do back lunges.  For the pushups etc., you could try to use dumb bells to support your wrists.

**This is truly an advanced workout, with very few modifications given.  To make the workout easier, you could do it with no weights and also do it without using the gliding discs.

If you are looking to breakthrough a plateau and want to mix up your workout routine with something fun, try this workout!",1323993600,35,2178,4.8108108108108105
2691814,5,B000KJOQJC,"This is another winner from Cathe's Low Impact Series.  The focus of this workout is non-stop cardio, hence the term ""supersets.""  You do each routine twice through.  You are doing low impact cardio, compound movements with light weights and body weight exercises.  It's all there.  Even though light weights are used for a few sections, they are for keeping your heart rate up and not for muscle conditioning.

Why I love this workout:

**My heart rate was up there for the entire workout.  Yes, it's low impact, but definitely not low intensity.

**It was hard, but not extremely so.  I definitely felt worked out, but not exhausted after finishing.

**The wonderful way my core is worked.  Yes, there are lots of mountain climbers, burpees and pushups in this workout.  But they work my core like nothing else, so I struggle on and do them anyway.

**The variety of routines.  If you don't care for a routine, wait for a minute or so and you're on the next one.

**The music had a rockin' beat, which I find very motivating.  I normally don't like Cathe's taste in music, but in this case, the music was pretty good.  It's all instrumentals, no vocals and I didn't recognize any of the tunes, but I still enjoyed it.

**The premixes.  I'm one of a dying breed who loves to work out for at least an hour a day.  The Cardio Super Set workout is about 41 minutes, but you can add on the Bonus Step routine for a 64 minute workout.  Or, you can do Cardio Super Sets Extreme for a 60+ minute workout.  There are also shorter (30 minute or so) premixes.

**The Bonus Step routine is a fun way to add on the workout.  You're doing compound movements with light weights on a step.  You're also doing body weight work.

**Minimal equipment is needed.  All you need is a step, light weights and gliding discs.

Some things to note in this workout:

**Yes, it is low impact, but I'm not so sure that it is always joint friendly.  Cathe has us doing lots of knee repeaters, which can tweak the standing leg.  The use of the gliding discs for jumping jacks, lunges and mountain climbers might tweak your knees.

**I didn't like having to put my weights under my step when we were finished.  I'm so afraid that I won't have put them underneath all the way and I'll trip over them.  I always put them way off to the side to be safe.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a fun, intense and low impact workout.",1322352000,23,2406,4.425629290617849
2691815,5,B000KJOQJC,"I knew I was going to love this workout when I felt my legs start to burn a few minutes into the warm up.  I'm a recent convert to barre style workouts,  having started with Tracy Effinger's Squeeze series.  My usual workout routines consist of heavy weights and intense cardio.

Turbo Barre is part of Cathe's Low Impact Series.  You do high reps of all sorts.  This type of workout is what gives dancers their lean and toned look.

What I adored about this workout:

**It burns!  I love feeling my muscles work.  I feel so strong and accomplished.

**The posture emphasis.  I spend my days hunched over a computer, so I welcome anything that helps me with better posture.  I find myself standing taller after doing this workout.

**It's tough!  I couldn't keep up with Cathe and crew.  On several of the leg exercises, I was lucky to do about  half the reps.  This didn't discourage me, it gives me something to work towards.

**It's fun and the time flies.  Dare I say that I was disappointed when the final stretch segment came?  I didn't want the workout to end.

**Minimal equipment is needed.  All you need are:  light dumbbells, light resistance band and a chair.

**The music and the workout routine are in sync.  I normally don't like Cathe's taste in music, but this time, the music fit the workout.  I find it so much easier and more motivating to work out to a driving beat.

**The  pretty pink and black workout outfits.  Looking at these outfits provided a `distraction' from the pain of the workout.

Some things to note about this workout:

(I don't consider these negatives, but just things to note.)

**While the workout is low impact, several of the moves can tweak your knees, especially the curtsy lunges.  I would suggest watching the workout before attempting it and making note of those exercises that you may need to modify.

**Mostly your legs are worked in this routine.  You do maybe one exercise for each upper body part, e.g. biceps, triceps, chest and back.  I believe Cathe put these in for the calorie burn, not so much to really tone  these muscles.

**It's tough and it's non-stop.  Don't get discouraged if you can't keep up with Cathe and crew.  Your muscles need to build up the endurance to do these types of exercises.

I would have to say that this is my favorite workout in Cathe's Low Impact Series.  It's fun, it's different and it's effective.",1322179200,39,2389,4.588095238095238
2691816,5,B000KJOQJC,"This video included the step, resistance bands, weights and floor work. Ouch! I'm hurting today. I thought this video would be slow, low impact, and boring...Not! It's a nice length video maybe about an hour or so. It mixed step segment, weight segments, & blast segments. It had a fair amount of upper body exercises. Trust, you will burn fat and build muscle tone on this one. It's been a month now and I've lost 11 lbs with Cathe's videos and portion awareness. As always go to collagevideo.com to check out snippets of her videos. Good luck!",1306281600,3,545,4.628865979381444
2691817,5,B000KJOQJC,"This video runs slightly over an hour in length.  The breakdown of the video is one approximately 10 minute warm-up on the step.  This is followed by the 50 minute cardio series which is broken into three parts.  With each part, most of the time is spent doing step aerobics.  This is followed by a short weight session.  The weight session uses hand weights (I used 3 and 5 pound weights), a barbell, and a resistance band.  I don't have a barbell so I substituted hand weights.  The cardio routine is followed by a 10 minute abs workout.
The step routine is fairly basic and I could follow it relatively easily (I am not the most coordinated person-especially at 5 am).  I would say that after two times through I hit maybe a 6 or 7 on the exertion scale but I will probably go higher as I become more familiar with the routine and can put more energy into it instead of trying to remember the moves.  The weight section hits the biceps and triceps relatively well but I would not rely on this video for true strength training and toning.  The ab section is ok, there are better routines for ab workout out there but this is not bad.
Overall, a good workout for an intermediate level exerciser.",1261612800,,1196,4.3954545454545455

2691819,5,B000KJOQJC,"I have exercised with dvds and previously vhs for over 20 years, and have used or at least tried workouts from close to 100 different instructors. This dvd, like all the other cathe dvds I own, is fantastic. It is NOT a beginner workout however. For example, this is much more challenging than Denise Austin or Kathy Smith workouts. By more challenging I mean that it requires a greater cardiovascular capacity AND the choreography is more complex. On the other hand however the choreography is less complex than say Amy Bento's Advanced Step Challenge. I would consider myself average in dancing ability and was able to learn Cathe's routine in about 2 workout sessions. The beauty of it though is once you become familiar with Cathe's style and ""move terminology"" it gets easier and easiier to learn her other dvds.
This particular dvd is about 75 minutes long and is much less difficult than say IMAX3 or Bodymax2. I would classify it as solid intermediate, but it is also a great lighter workout for an advanced exerciser. It is a full body workout broken down into three circuits each including a cardio portion with a 2 minute higher intensity portion. Immediately after each cardio section, Cathe moves on to weight work (fairly light for advanced exercisers). The workout ends with ab work and stretching.  IMO,the music is very engaging and the filming quality is excellent.
I would suggest that anyone interested view the clips on her website. All her dvds are clearly described there and include clips for previews.
Cathe is the best... I have strayed many times for variety, but I always come back. My VO2max and overall strength have improved significantly since I began using her workouts regularly (4 times per week).  You just can't beat the quality of her workouts.",1237593600,,1782,4.877887788778878

8157185,4,B000KJOQJC,This is not the most challenging workout (although the repetitive moves are challenging for certain muscle groups) but I have used it twice so far when I am feeling like a less intense and different type of workout to shake things up. I am new to Cathe videos and love the low impact ones and the high impact ones are awesome but can be hard on my knees. I have a previous back injury and the barre work does tend to make my back extra sore even with proper core engagement which I am used to paying attention too given my back issues.  I think it has to do with some of the moves where you are leaning over with your arms on the bar.  I'll continue to use it but just be very aware of tightening my core during the exercises.,1515974400,,726,4.105633802816901
8157186,3,B000KJOQJC,"I really like this series of low impact workouts. Sometimes I just don't want the higher impact and jumping and I feel like this series fits the bill. This DVD wasn't as good as I was hoping though.

What I like:
The moves work well and leave you challenged at the end of a set but not spent.
Good variety that feels like it uses a lot of core.
Modifications can be made if you don't have discs or don't want to use them.
Nice to have a 40 minute workout instead of a 55 minute one.
No step or tricky choreography (in the main workout).
The stretch is yoga-based, but hits all the good points.

What I don't like:
I burned under 200 calories for the main workout. Usually in cardio-focused workouts, I burn many more calories for a 40 minute segment.
Repeating the set (I think that is the point of the ""super sets"") isn't my favorite. In one of the premixes, you double the workout by repeating the whole thing, which is too repetitive.
The music is particularly blah.

I haven't tried the bonus step yet, but I am not a step fan so we'll see if I get to that or not. I intend to keep this one, it just doesn't get my heart rate pumping as high as Afterburn or Athletic Training (both in this same series). Would be a good one for a day when I want to do cardio, but don't want to be dripping on the mats.",1505088000,,1306,4.113725490196078

8157189,5,B000KJOQJC,"I did Pure Barre classes for 2 years, and find this to be comparable in difficulty. I really love this video. This is a fun, absorbing workout that is challenging without being frustrating. It gets your heart rate up and tires you out. The upper body and lower body sections are both really engaging and tough, on the level of an in-person barre class. The core section is short, but intense and effective. She does a combination of traditional barre moves and unique/unusual moves to keep it interesting. The reps are long enough for you to master the move and fatigue the muscle, but change often enough not never be boring. There is no impact and no dancing - just precise movement. I think it would be fine for beginners as she gives very detailed instructions, but if you're a barre enthusiast, you will find enough here to keep your attention and make you sore.

I do modify a couple of the moves - for example, with the second half of the standing outer thigh work (where you're supposed to ""wrap your leg around a tree trunk"" as they say in Pure Barre), I do that in a clamshell position on the floor instead to avoid pain in my hip flexors, and I replace lunges with a glute bridge to give my knees a rest. She gives a few modifications - usually to drop your heels or stay shallow - but since she's so clear on what you should be working with each exercise, you can easily swap to something else you are already familiar with to work those muscle groups.

Cathe is an awesome instructor. She is clear and easy to follow. Her attitude is upbeat and encouraging, but never annoying. A lot of what she discusses during the workout is how/what you should feel and the purpose of each movement, even in the warmup, so you know what muscle(s) should be feeling it and can adjust to get the move just right. The music has no words, but it's high-energy without being cheesy, and easy to count reps to. Cathe and the 4 women demonstrating the moves are adorable and engaging to watch.",1496707200,,1986,4.438356164383562

Don't let this scare you off though, she has a 32 min premix of one cycle of all the workouts so you can work up to the ~50 min 2 cycles of all the exercises.
