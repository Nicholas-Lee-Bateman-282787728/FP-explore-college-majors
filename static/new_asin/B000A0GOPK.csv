I felt stuck.  I'm a completist so I really hate being stuck with an incomplete concept like, for instance, the entire 5 seasons of ""Taxi"".

I was beginning to become afraid to start buying any TV shows on DVD for fear that they may decide not to finish what they started.

Well, thank God we will finally get to own all five seasons of ""Taxi"". I was wondering what CBS was waiting for.",1182211200,5,453,4.270588235294118

8071113,5,B000A0GOPK,I always have loved the show Taxi. Loui De Palmer and the rest of the crew have made me laugh for many years so when I saw this box set I couldn't resist and I'm glad I didn't. The show is just as funny as I remebered. Now I don't have to wait till it comes on Tv Land it is here in my library for many more years of laughter whenever I need a laugh.
