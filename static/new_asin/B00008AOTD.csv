1832591,5,B00008AOTD,"Because of my work I never really even seen any of the series until the last season.  Once I did though I was hooked.  So when I saw they released this set I had to get it to see what I missed.  Let me just give this one warning.  If you have a good sense of humor then I'd suggest you don't try watching this while eating a meal or you might find yourself choking from laughing so hard with food in your mouth.

This is really a lot of fun because it takes a really simple satire to launch a lot of sexy jibes from, but then it mixes in a lot of hidden humor throughout that makes you want to pay attention so you are able to catch it all.  This is a damn good series to kick back and just enjoy the hell out of.  Especailly if you've just got done with a not so pleasant day.

Finally:  I usually don't like sitting through the commentaries of movies I've already watched unless I'm interested in finding out what the hell something meant.  I found that to be just the opposit on the episodes they had actor and director commentaries available.  After watching an episode and then playing it through with the commentaries I found even more stuff to laugh at.  All in all it's a bit off color at times, and completely off PC, but absolutely funny all the time...",1059696000,5,1263,4.152263374485597
1832592,5,B00008AOTD,"Once ""The Shield"" became popular, the cable channel FX decided it was too good to air Son of the Beach and cancelled the show. I thought this was a shame...I always thought the show was clever and under-rated, and always fun to watch. Now the show has made it to DVD.
This 3-disc set contains the first 21 episodes from seasons 1 and 2 of the show. The episodes are all hilarious...if you like one, you'll like them all.
There's also some nice extras...there's a funny outtakes reel, and behind the scenes stuff. If you like women wearing next to nothing, there's several new ""montages"" (Montages being the moments on the show where the characters stop and say ""now what would THAT be like?"") The best extras are the commentaries on several episodes by Tim Stack, the producers, and assorted cast members. It's clear they had a fun time making the show, and it's interesting to hear them talk about it. I highly recommend this boxset, and I hope they release the rest of seasons 2 and 3.",1055548800,30,987,4.550561797752809
1832593,5,B00008AOTD,"Son of the beach in my mind is the funniest tv comdey series made. It is about time they are putting it on dvd. I still can't beleive married with children still isn't out on series by series instead of this best of stuff. Oh well. Anyways you would be wise to buy this set. ""Queefer Madness"" alone is worth the price of this set. If you are looking for a down right outrageous comedy television series, Son of the Beach is right for you. Trust me, there is now way not to laugh at this show. Go ahead and buy it.",1048723200,4,513,4.03921568627451
1832594,5,B00008AOTD,"The first time that I saw this show, when it came out on FX, I was skeptic that it would be any good. Boy, I was wrong. The show is actually a Howard Stern show, which is better. He's a pretty funny guy. The show had lots of dirty, mature, mommies-and-daddies only stuff, but it was hilarious.
 When I saw this DVD was coming out, I couldn't believe it! Finally, they are bringing another great TV show to DVD!
 I went ahead and placed my order for it, and you should too.
 THIS IS QUALITY PROGRAMMING!!!",1047859200,7,504,4.229166666666667

1832607,5,B00008AOTD,"This DVD collection is a must have for anyone who has seen this show during it's rather short run on FX. Apparently this show was cancelled and replaced by The Shield, which I don't think anyone in the continental United States has seen. What a travesty. Anyway, get this DVD! You will laugh until your insides hurt. Notch, Jamaica, Chip, B.J., Kimberlee, Steve the Dog - they are all funny! I just hope that they release the rest of the episodes.

 you can only get 1, go with the first volume.",1303084800,,309,4.509090909090909
1832609,4,B00008AOTD,"Yes, pretty good. I don`t find all the jokes and such funny, but there has been several times i laughed. I like many of the sexual jokes, innuendo and double entendres. I like those ""What would that be like?"" montages that happens in each episode, even though i think they are usally too short. The lesbian character Ellen is also good in my opinion. I think something funny usually happens when Ellen is on screen.

I pretty much like all the characters, except that annoying Kody. I think Anita and Kimberlee Clark is just ok. I think is Jamaica very pretty, but dislike her for speaking ebonics. Most of the times she speaks, i think she is just embarrassing herself. Even i feel embarrassed for her. Pity the creators had to make her speak like that. I think the picture quality could have been better. This series is grainy, but i think the 16mm is the reason for that, since they filmed it with that, + it`s a low budget series.

I think the Dolby Surround 2.0, audio track had good quality. The dialog sounds good in the Center speaker and occasionally some music. Surprisingly the rear speakers are used often in each episode which i like. I also use my Subwoofer, even though it doesn`t have a channel for it, i think the bass sounds good, especially when they punch the villains and such.  Too bad only 42 episodes was made. I would have liked to see 2 more full seasons. Hmm.",1281052800,,1386,4.470355731225297

If you look at what is on TV today you will not find any shows willing to push the bar like this one did. It takes cojones to run a show like this, especially for 2 seasons. Since I can't watch this with the wife and kids, I'll have to wait a while before shelling out for season 2, but all in good time...",1245715200,,412,4.036585365853658

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for volume 2, but hopefully it will be released in November.  By the way, whatever happened to 'Howard Stern the Teenage Years'? or the ""Brother Sam' movie?

1832622,5,B00008AOTD,"Ok, this is pretty low brow humor but the jokes run thick and fast and many could be easily missed by the less astute. Remember that this is a series that poked fun at itself and did so well at it that some times you need to look below the surface and take the humor for what it is; having a good time. It takes all the cornball elements of ""serious"" tv shows, bundles them up into this clever little show and hurls them back with gusto.

I loved Son of the Beach on TV and on DVD it is even better.  I watched the entire collection twice over the weekend (yes, perhaps I do need to get out more) and it still has me rolling.  Sure, it isn't the world's most sophisticated humor, but darn if it ain't funny.

The entire cast is brilliant from Timothy Stack to Jaime Bergman to Steve the Dog, and did I mention that the women were all beautiful?  If I didn't, let me say it now, the women are all beautiful!

1832640,5,B00008AOTD,"True, I thought it was incredibly idiotic when I first started watching it, but this silly series really does grow on you.  And yeah, it is pretty low-brow stuff, but I find the vulgarity is executed in such a good natured way that it works.  The cast work well together and each episode moves along quite quickly, so that if there's something you're not enjoying, or are even offended by, it's over before you know it.  I'm glad I bought this, and I would gladly buy another set containing the rest of the episodes, because it's good to have a DVD set like this around for when you're in the mood for something fun, silly, and well, not exactly sexy, but let's say easy on the eyes...",1108425600,5,685,4.377952755905512

I don't even ever remember hearing about this coming out on tv. when I got it, I popped in disc 1 and watched it all the way through with my girlfriend. we literally couldn't stop laughing. I love it so much more than the futurama. It lasts for 21 episodes (futurama had a little more than half that)!

but back to son of the beach, I think it's more of a comedy for the immature crowd that loves watching overly corny, random sex jokes that are so corny, they're totally funny. oh, and the crowd that likes girls in lingerie and notch johnson with his shirt off. If you're an angry feminist, just look the other way, but if you like beer and holdem I'd definitely recommend it",1105747200,8,762,4.255172413793104

This show was cancelled during its third season.  This box set includes season one, and the first half of season two.  One more box set would complete the series, but due to low sales of this set, volume two will never be released.  Too bad, 'cause all the episodes that I remember seeing were on this set.

1832644,5,B00008AOTD,"This volume is hilarious bar none. Imagine all the 1st seasons episodes without commercials and not having to wait a week for the next one.

Though I'm not sure what one would expect from a show that sprung from the creative mind (preceding term used very loosely) of Howard Stern. If you're a huge Tim Stack fan, wait for somebody to release ""Night Stand"" on DVD (or don't, because you'll be waiting forever). One might make the comment that ""Son of the Beach"" was intentionally terrible, but does that make it any less offensive to your intelligence or bereft of humour? I'm going to say ""no.""

Timothy Stack (from the short lived but equally funny Night Stand with Dick Dietrich) plays Notch Johnson; the world's greatest lifeguard who, with his crew of hard bodied lifeguards (including ... Jamie Bergman) outwit the mafia, assassins, and lots of other baddies, while featuring a plethora of guest stars (including The Sopranos Vincent Pastore, Alan Thicke, David Arquette, Lucas Haas, Neil Patrick Harris, and Gilbert Gottfried among others).  The humor may be too juvenile for many, but fans of the Howard Stern show or just low brow comedy in general will definitely have a blast with this sadly short lived series.",1064016000,21,924,5.112582781456954
1832648,4,B00008AOTD,"From the Howard Stern Production Company, come the most madcap lifeguards to ever patrol the surf in the hilarious comedy series ""Son of the Beach"". The screwball comedy series follows the outrageous misadventures of famous head lifeguard Notch Johnson (Tim Stack) and the members of his scintillating unit SPF-30.  Notch Johnson and his well-endowed misfits protect the sunny beaches of Malibu Adjacent from countless dangers including sinister cult leaders, dangerous mobsters, greedy developers and evil terrorists. ""Son of the Beach"" is the side-splitting ""Baywatch"" parody that premiered on the FX Network in the spring of 2000. If you like mindless entertainment and scantily-clad women, then you're going to enjoy ""Son of the Beach"". The comedy series won't win any awards for its silly stories and lame acting but does offer an abundance of bawdy sex jokes, obvious genre cliches, movie parodies, skimpy eye candy and great low-brow humor. ""Son of the Beach"" also features guest appearances by Mark Hamill, Vincent Pastore, David Arquette, Erik Estrada, Gary Coleman, Gilbert Gottfried and Jerry Springer.

If you're a male between 18 and 34 interested in gratuitous T&A, then ""Son of the Beach - Volume 1"" will have you laughing out loud. All 21 episodes from the first two seasons are presented in their original full screen format. This 3-Disc DVD has a good video transfer with some noticeable grain. Its Dolby Digital 2.0 audio is reasonably pleasant. Its special features include disc introductions by star Tim Stack, fun audio commentaries with cast members and production crew on ten selected episodes, three sexy montage highlights, some promotional trailers, a few short behind-the-scenes featurettes and a 6-minute outtake reel.
