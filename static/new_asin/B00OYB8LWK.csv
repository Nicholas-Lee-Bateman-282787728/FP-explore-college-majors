6776335,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Again, Suzanne has come out with a fantastic dvd.  I like how you can do different parts of the dvd or the entire thing.  The only segment I have not done is the extreme cardio.  The other segments were typical Suzanne style.  Very enjoyable!",1418601600,2,242,4.431818181818182
6776336,5,B00OYB8LWK,"This is the newest DVD in my BarreAmped Collection and I cannot thank Suzanne enough for continuously excelling at what she delivers.  This DVD offers intervals mixed with barre exercises. I have never come across such an amazing instructor, who truly cares about her followers, their fitness results and their overall happiness.  Her method is fantastic, effective, fun and makes you want to keep coming back.  I love her attention to form, so you will be pleased with her gentle reminders throughout - because, honestly - we definitely zone out and lose focus, but she is right there to make sure our moves are intentional and the time we invested yields best results possible.  It is a must have - it will change your life! - Ewa Z.",1418601600,5,735,4.71875
6776337,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I cannot praise this video enough!  Suzanne, as always, put together the PERFECT barre inspired cardio workout.  The interval got my heart rate up and had me dripping with sweat.  The strength and core work was great too, not your typical workout.  Suzanne gives great cues and always has good posture reminders throughout.  This video is great for the beginner to the most advanced.  If you are looking for an indoor cardio alternative I highly recommend this video.  What is also nice about the DVD is that you can pick what portions of the workout you want to do (chapters).  Get one of these for yourself and one for a friend, you won't regret it!",1417910400,12,651,4.6
6776338,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Best DVD of all time and I have an extensive collection. The production value is amazing the set, camera work, music and the workout it self the best I have seen. Suzanne Bowen is an amazing instructor that is positive and encouraging....she is the best at form cues (there is a section that she gives you tips) I love the routine itself so fun and sweaty. There is no dread factor at all so much fun. It is everything you want in fitness dvd and more. There are three workouts that you can mix and match as well as a really fantastic stretch. The first section is about 26m and it is tabata meets Barre Amped cardio...it will leave you breathless and shaking it is FUN. The next section is cardio and weights mixed together in Suzanne's unique method you will be sore in all the right places after this one. The last section is cardio/core and I love the fact that half of it is standing ab work so fun again no dread factor and I usually hate core work. This is a must in any ones fitness library there are 3 levels so you can grow with this one. The beauty of Suzanne's method is that it gets harder as you progress because you learn to get deeper and better form leading to a huge burn effect. I could not recommend this anymore.",1417392000,51,1233,4.251063829787234
6776339,5,B00OYB8LWK,My DVD came this weekend and I LOVE this workout! I love how you can mix and match the workouts and I poured sweat! The three levels really help me listen to my body and learn correct form. I love Suzanne Bowen she rocks!,1416182400,20,221,4.045454545454546
6776340,4,B00OYB8LWK,"I just did this workout for the first time and really enjoyed it, however I expected it to be advanced and it was intermediate.  If you are looking for a strong intermediate workout without plyo this is a great workout for you.
Advanced to me is Breathless Body, Insanity, P90X, P90X2, STS or almost anything Cathe Friedrich.  Suzanne is a very good and likeable instructor and I did feel that I got a great workout, but I think that is largely because it is over an hour long and I did another 30 minute kickboxing workout before this one.

I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 largely because it wasn't what I expected in 3 ways:
1.  Since it includes tabata, I expected it to be advanced but it was an intermediate workout.  My heart rate for the tabata portion stayed in the low-to-mid-140's.  I don't consider something advanced unless my heart rate is consistently in the 150-160 range.  For advanced tabata, the Breathless Body or Cathe HIIT workouts are far more intense.
2. I've recently become interested in barre and this is the 3rd barre workout that I've done in the last month.  XTend Barre: Lean & Chiseled and Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body both burned my tush to failure and were excellent.  The leg/barre work again was more intermediate, I felt like she stopped many times before I even started to feel a burn.  And she didn't use a barre, it was all standing and required more balance.
3. The abs section felt like a beginner workout and didn't really do much to work my abs.",1476576000,2,1505,4.54074074074074
6776341,5,B00OYB8LWK,Another hit from Suzanne Bowen's BarreAmped series.  Non-punishing cardio that really gets results.  Can't say enough about her workouts.  Also love that she offers different levels to follow depending on your fitness level/needs.,1471219200,3,230,5.909090909090909
6776342,5,B00OYB8LWK,"SUPER Workout. It's sure to challenge you! There are 3 levels of  participation and it's very useful for the novice to the advanced. Up the ante by following the person who  challenges you more.  I like the concept and I like that it works all parts of my body. Modify as necessary
Suzanne Bowen is terrific!",1469318400,2,308,4.464285714285714
6776343,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Great workout! You can work at different levels and your results can vary depending on how hard you work.

6776345,5,B00OYB8LWK,My best friend has been an avid  proponent of the Lotte Berk Method for years and recently told me she had found a new workout to spice up her routine.  I myself have been looking for a work out that was not as high impact as P90X so I decided to try Barre Amped at her insistence.  Now I am by no means a ballerina but I was interested in giving it a shot and I must say that I was really impressed!  The work outs were intense and I feel that they will make a difference in flexibility as well as helping with my weight loss.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a new workout!!,1457913600,8,602,4.025210084033613

6776348,5,B00OYB8LWK,"There is not a workout by Suzanne that is not challenging and effective. This video is easy to follow while also challenging.

6776355,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Cardio is right! Love this combo of barre and cardio. Suzanne is very motivating. Also, for people who are not as fit she offers modifications and one of the models does that on every move. The cardio part may be hard for beginners, but I personally loved it as an avid runner.",1442016000,,277,4.346153846153846
6776356,5,B00OYB8LWK,Suzanne Bowen is one of my favorite dvd fitness instructors.  I love BarreAmped.  I am excited she included a Cardio Fat Burn to the collection.  The workout offers modifications for beginners and advanced moves for those who want to kick it up a notch.  Suzanne Bowen offers good cueing thought the routine.,1441670400,2,308,4.865384615384615
6776357,5,B00OYB8LWK,This is my first time trying Suzanne Bowens workout after reading so much about her. I forgot to choose my option in the main dvd menu and din realise it staffed off with the tabata Interval. It was v good. And she really worked my legs... My Legs were sore for days after the workout. In a happy way. I was pretty tired after the workout that i forgot to do the cool down. Overall an amazing workout with lots of modifications.,1441065600,4,428,4.2317073170731705

6776360,5,B00OYB8LWK,Love these workouts. They are very challenging but not in the way that you dread doing it again. I love how you can work at different levels and Suzanne is a great instructor. Definitely recommend this DVD as well as the rest in the series.,1439424000,,240,4.355555555555555

6776363,3,B00OYB8LWK,"I wouldn't call this cardio or fat burning for advanced level exercisers, even though the back says extreme cardio fat burn.  It barely got my heart rate up enough to be considered a warm up, but it is different - nice to mix in for light days.",1438128000,6,244,4.191489361702128
6776364,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I own 3 DVDs (barre Amped bootcamp, and TTT) from Suzanne Bowen and I appreciate her clear instruction and on point reminders.

6776371,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I have all of the BarreAmped DVD's and this is another winner!  I love, love, love cardio and this one delivers it!  The instruction is wonderful and you are provided modifications or advancements, depending on your level.  I rotate thru all the BarreAmped DVD's through out the week and always feel like I am getting the best workout!",1429056000,,335,4.741379310344827
6776372,4,B00OYB8LWK,"I enjoyed this a lot more then her other Barre dvd's but not as much as her Tighten,Tone&torch DVD.I love that I worked up a sweat even though it was low impact and I'm glad this is in my collection for those days when I Don't feel like an intense cardio workout but still want to feel worked",1428796800,,292,4.051724137931035
6776373,3,B00OYB8LWK,"I enjoy this workout. Suzanne is an excellent instructor and explains the moves thoroughly. As much as I enjoyed this DVD, however, there was one thing that turned me off. The cover of the DVD states there is 'free' one month streaming for customers who purchased this DVD. Howvever, when you arrive at her website, you discover that one must input their credit card number in order to access the one ""free"" month. If you forget to unenroll or cancel a month later, you will be charged the one month fee on your cc. I found this reverse billing practice (of sorts) to be disingenuous and enough to deter me from joining. If you say it's free- it should be free, no strings attached. Be transparent.",1428624000,4,698,4.5476190476190474
6776374,5,B00OYB8LWK,Love this work-out! Great video!!,1427846400,,33,5.8
6776375,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I bought this after using and liking the Barre Amped Bootcamp DVD. Though the title is cardio it's definitely not the usual dance or aerobic cardio you might be used to. So if you're looking for a non-stop steady-state cardio workout then this probably isn't for you. Instead it's more of an interval workout of exercises with large range of motion to get your heart rate up alternated with more typical barre-type toning exercises done at a quick pace. I'm a big barre fan (classes and DVDs) and this one is probably the toughest I've tried. It's deceptive- you think ""ok, I'm in my bare feet with just a mat- how intense can the cardio really be?"".  Then 10 minutes later you're out of breath, sweating, and your legs are shaky. I'm in decent shape and work out regularly so I'm not writing from a beginner perspective. I love that I can do just one or two of the segments on their own if I don't have a ton of time.",1427760000,43,918,4.368421052631579
6776376,5,B00OYB8LWK,Awesome! Loved it!,1427587200,,18,5.333333333333333
6776377,5,B00OYB8LWK,LOVE these Cardio workouts! Suzanne is an extremely encouraging and knowledgeable instructor.  These DVDs have finally given me something I feel I can do & stick with as a part of my workout routine.,1427328000,,199,4.852941176470588
6776378,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Words are completely inadequate to describe the effectiveness of this workout. I have her other two workouts DVDs and they are good, but this one is truly great. The ""shake to change"" and ""being on fire"" happens early, often and lasts a long time, so the results are amazing. As always Suzanne's manner and encouragement are a big plus in making her DVD/workouts very likable. If you are REALLY serious about changing your body, this is definitely something that should be in your personal collection.",1426896000,3,501,4.905882352941177
6776379,5,B00OYB8LWK,"MERCY! This is a fantastic workout!  If you are new to Tabata,  HITT, or interval training you might want to take it easy at first.  I like this mostly because Susan Bowen,  the creator of this workout,  an the other women on the DVD actually do this along with you. They sweat and shake just like you're doing during the routines.  They are each doing different intensities of the exercises andwhichever one you choose you will sweat. Again,  if you aren't use to doing the types of above mentioned exercises I suggest that you follow the beginner lady. I was all overly ambitious and tried to follow the advanced lady and ... well it wasn't pretty;  I'll have to work up to that.  This is very adaptable to all fitness levels and time friendly.  I highly recommend it!",1426636800,3,770,4.5144927536231885
6776380,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Great workout. Excellent instruction and modifications.  Routines can be combined or done separately when you don't have too much time. It is not boring, time goes fast when you are exercising. Very balanced and complete workout.",1425945600,,229,5.361111111111111
6776381,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I'm always looking for a low impact cardio workout, this is it! While it may not be the same workout as a barre studio class, this workout is ballet inspired.  My heart rate remained high thoughout the entire hour, spiking and lowering depending on the choreography.  There are three levels to follow along with making this workout doable for all ages/fitness levels.  Personally, I switched between the advanced/moderate moves and saw quite a large calorie burn at the end of the workout.  And, the time flew by.  Pros:  excellent instructor, very little space needed, great set/music, low impact/high intensity.",1425600000,10,613,5.141414141414141
6776382,2,B00OYB8LWK,"I was beyond disappointed in this DVD. The actual workout took forever to get to, and then it started with a warm up (which you already completed in the previous section). Barre camp classes are fast paced, and although this was listed as a high intensity workout, there was nothing fast paced about it. There were breaks after every rep and too many repetitions of the same boring exercise. I did the entire DVD and still felt like I didn't get an arm workout at all. I did get a good lower body workout, but not from any ballet type of moves. And I bought this DVD specifically for the ballet element of barre. There were mixed reviews on these DVD series from other buyers, and I felt this one was the best to go with. I now know I won't enjoy any of the DVDs in this series. For anyone who is looking to duplicate a barre class workout, my advice is to shell out the money for the classes, because I haven't found any DVDs that come close to duplicating them, and this DVD was supposed to be the best.",1425513600,10,1005,4.239583333333333

6776384,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I can't say enough good things about this video. I really hate work out tapes and this one surprised me. Because of health reasons, I need to do cardio based workouts. If you are diabetic, these are the perfect exercises to try. It's broken into 4 parts, each with a warm up in between and each segment has 'bursts' of cardio. Which is great for getting the heart rate up along with quick breaks. Suzanne is a pleasure to listen to, she takes things nice and easy. And the other instructors working out with her show different ways to do the moves - so basically three levels being shown at the same time - and they are actually real women, not just models who never sweet.  lol  Plus if you order one of her dvds, you'll get a free month trail on her web page, so you can use a huge variety of workouts.",1424822400,,804,4.214285714285714
6776385,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Another winner from Suzanne Bowen!
If you like barre and are already a fan of SBF, you'll have to add this to your collection of her other workouts! And if you don't have any yet, get this -together with her other workouts! ;)
What I like about this (as well as her other 2 barre DVDs) is that you can chose to do only 1 segment when pressed for time and still get a nice little workout in or you do 2 or all 3. Either way, all of the exercises are very effective and fun to do!
Suzanne's calm demeanor is very pleasant and makes working out fun!",1424736000,,546,4.018348623853211
6776386,3,B00OYB8LWK,"I gave this DVD 3 stars because it's definitely not the best Barre workout I've ever done. I expected it to be fast paced and similar to being in an actual BarreAmped class. The instructor talks way too much and the workout takes forever to complete because of this. I workout with 4 other ladies as well and they agree that it's not great. We are returning the DVD's because we feel they take way to long to complete, they aren't enjoyable, and they aren't very effective. Jessica Smith TV has great workouts online. They're free, energetic, effective, and she is a very likable instructor. We will be doing those instead.",1424131200,9,623,4.621621621621622
6776387,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I have several of Suzanne's DVDs and am also a subscriber to her online workouts. I have 3 years of BarreAmped experience and love taking studio classes, but as a busy mom of 2 with the closest studio 40 minutes away, Suzanne's home workouts are so perfect for me. Suzanne's philosophy of exercise really resonates with me- mind-body connection, neutral spine, being the best me I can be. I love that the workouts focus on the total body but that you can also mix and match if you are short on time or want to work alternating body parts. One of the challenges with working out at home is pushing yourself.

6776389,3,B00OYB8LWK,"Having taken several Barre Code classes, I had high expectations for this DVD.  I was always quite sore and had a tough time completing a lot of the exercises in class.  There is a lot of slow time and not nearly enough attention to arm work.  My calves were a little tight the next day after I did the entire DVD but that's about it.  If you're new to exercise, this is a good DVD.  If you're more advanced, I'd say keep searching for a tougher barre class.",1423180800,4,458,4.159090909090909

The workout is broken in sections so I can have one long total body blast.  Or break it into what I have time for.  Out of all her workouts I own this one leaves me with the most doms. Excellent workout!,1419120000,4,364,4.0

6776398,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I have only recently started doing barre inspired workouts and have tried various dvds with other instructors.  Some leaving me feeling very frustrated because of the lack of guidance and instructions.  None of the other ones that I have tried have been as great as the ones that I have tried by Suzanne Bowen.  Her latest one is just another wonderful DVD that I was very excited to add to my collection.  Suzanne provides genuine guidance and encouragement throughout all of her workouts, she makes you want to succeed in working out and makes you feel like she is right there with you mastering the moves.  I have no dread factor when I pick up one of her workouts knowing that after I am done, I will feel great.  If you have never done barre workouts and want to try, Suzannes DVDs are the way to go.  I look forward to each and every new one she will come out with.",1418688000,23,871,4.372670807453416
6776399,5,B00OYB8LWK,Excellent barre cardio! Suzanne Bowen is such an amazing barre and fitness expert/teacher. She knows what she is talking about! You can't go wrong with anything done by Suzanne. I subscribe to her streaming but I also have all of her dvd's for when I'm in a place that doesn't get wifi. I only do her method now and I'm in better shape than I was when I was a professional ballerina in training when I was in my teens! You don't have to struggle like crazy through an INSANE cardio segment to get great results. This video is perfect for all levels as there is 3 levels demonstrated throughout the segments.,1418688000,18,607,4.428571428571429
8685315,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Added this DVD for my prenatal workout rotation for low impact cardio. I worked out to her Sleek & Toned Prenatal and Leah Sarago's Fit + Sleek Prenatal all through first pregnancy and wanted a bit more variety and cardio second time around. You'll raise your heart rate enough, but it's not crazy intense. I decided to try another Suzanne Bowen dvd b/c she's great with cueing and I didn't get annoyed/tired of her after much repeating. I've been able to split the difference between the easy and medium fitness level, and then make some pregnancy modifications for abs no planking or twisting etc. Probably wouldn't start here for prenatal since it's not specific to pregnancy or as modular if you're just getting used to working out in 2nd trimester. Before/between pregnancy, I was fairly fit, lifted weights regularly, and ran couple of miles a week.",1525046400,2,855,4.863013698630137

8685318,5,B00OYB8LWK,"Love this workout, it give you such a burn and also one girl does beginner and Suzanne doe intermediate and last girl more advanced.
Your legs are going to feel the burn. Love this as much as cathe friedrich and that's saying a lot",1499472000,3,231,4.2727272727272725
8685319,5,B00OYB8LWK,Started out using classical stretching. Needed a little more of a workout in addition to essentrics. This fit the bill. Will order more workouts.,1492300800,,145,5.083333333333333
8685320,5,B00OYB8LWK,Superior instructor with great cueing and flow.  Light weights can burn!,1490400000,,72,5.545454545454546
8685321,2,B00OYB8LWK,"I love exercise. I love home workout DVDs. I don't really like this. I can work four times harder in half the time with Jillian Michaels or Bob Harper. I can get a way better burn from Pop Pilates or even a moderate yoga class. The instructor is pleasant enough and gives good cues/directions, but I don't want to spend 80 minutes to work up a slight sweat when I can sweat a few buckets in 30-60. I really expected this to be harder.  Even the ""cardio"" is pretty light. At first I thought I'd keep this and just try heavier weights, but for me it still just takes too long for too little return. If your time is limited, I'd explore other options.",1489449600,3,648,4.225806451612903
8685322,5,B00OYB8LWK,Great workouts. Not punishing on the body but I worked up a decent sweat. There are 3 levels. Suzanne demonstrates good form on the exercises.  Very effective.,1487721600,2,159,4.888888888888889
8685323,5,B00OYB8LWK,"I really enjoy doing this entire dvd, but if I'm pressed for time, I will just do the 27 minute cardio routine and still feel like I achieved my fitness goal. Ms. Bowen produces high quality products and because of her, barre is quickly becoming my go-to workout. I am impressed with her teaching style and the balance she finds with challenging you but not making you feel defeated in anyway. Cardio Fat Burn (3) and the Bootcamp (4) are my absolute favorite workouts.",1482192000,4,469,4.595238095238095
