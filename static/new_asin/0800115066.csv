168823,5,0800115066,"I'm a big fan of Denzel, and all reviewers are right about the quality and sensuality of the love story that is central to this movie. And where else will most of us get to see Denzel do ""The Electric Slide?"" But...having said that, I found that the love story was the least interesting thing about this movie! I was fascinated to learn about the Indian culture in the South (and I have seen the ""American owned"" signs on motels in the South, an obvious attempt to attract patrons who don't want to stay at an Indian owned motel). The deep pain of exile felt by the father was the most moving element to me. I felt moved to tears at several points, and at the end. As a Jew, I identified very strongly with the father's and family's distress at being forcibly and violently evicted from home based on racial and ethnic hatred. A wonderful film.",1065052800,5,844,4.382165605095541
168824,5,0800115066,"This film is a wonderfully acted, directed and scripted parable on the power of love to overcome racial and ethnic divisions, filled with humor, insight, pathos and inspiration, and which completely avoids the trap of becoming preachy.
One of its particularly interesting insights for me was its take on the polarizing nature of black-white racial divisions in this country.  This is shown not only by the negative reaction of the local Indian community in this small Mississippi town to the romance of one of its women by a black man, but, even more revealingly, by the response of the local whites, which results in the bank calling in its loan on Denzel Washington's carpet cleaning business, along with the loss of his white clientele.  Even though the relationship in question is between two dark skinned people, the whites react to this as though the Indian woman is white. In otherwords, for the whites, if you are not black you are white, or, at least, the equivalent of white.
I strongly recommend this movie.",1061078400,4,1018,4.878612716763006
168825,4,0800115066,"What a brilliant piece of low-key, realistic movie making, from the days when Mira Nair was making in your face movies such as Salaam Bombay and Mississipi Masala.
The first thing admirable about it is Nair's ability to merge three cultures (Uganda, India, & Southern American) into an enchanting love story. An Indian family of a man, his wife and their young daughter Mina are expelled from Uganda under the reign of dictator Amin. The family eventually moves to the U.S. When Mina grows up she finds herself caught in a curious cultural twist and considers herself a mix ""masala"". She later falls in love with a black carpet cleaner (played immaculately by Denzil) only to stir up a hornet's nest in her family, culture and community.
The movie is from 1992, so the mild racism undercurrent may be a bit tired but wasn't when it came out, in fact most of the ironies (e.g., both the lovers are ""colored"" in different shades) are shown in a light-hearted and dignified manner.
The movie has a clutch of hilarious moments as well, which make it an all round fun movie to watch. Both the protagonists, Denzil as the southern man and Sarita Chaudhari as the Indian woman, are actually quite likeable characters and you end up caring about both of them.
A very wholesome treat to watch!",1059696000,35,1284,4.685840707964601
168826,5,0800115066,"I've been a fan of Mira Nair's ""Mississippi Masala"" since seeing it's original theatrical release in the early '90s. I was very dissapointed, when for a good period of time it was out of print. Now to my great surprise and delight the movie has been released to DVD.""Mississippi Masala"" is a wonderful comedy/drama about coming of age, race relations and ruminations of home and the heart. Director, Mira Nair has deftly told the story of a transplanted Indian family, who has uneasily settled in rural Mississippi. We learn (in a series of backflashes) how the family had to sadly leave their native country of Uganda, under a mass expulsion ordered by dictator,General Idi Amin in the early '70s. The family's father, Jaye (well played by Roshan Seth) loses everything including his property, his best friend, his country and his self respect. Fast forward eighteen years later. The immigrant family's daughter, Mina (Sarita Choudury) has grown into a beautiful young women and is the 'Masala' of the film's title (a hot & spicey mixture of exotic ingrediants). Through a series of comical incidents she meets and falls in love with an pesonable, African American man named Demitrious (Denzel Washington), who runs his own carpet cleaning business. Sparks fly as the area's two minority communities (African-American & Indian) react with both hostlity and humor to the lover's interacial romance. This is a story about discovering one's place in life. About finding out where you belong and being with the one you love. Eventually the main characters learn the lesson that ""home is where the heart is"".This is wonderful moving film that touches both the heart and the funnybone. I highly recommend it!",1054252800,5,1703,5.064056939501779
168827,3,0800115066,"For many years Denzel Washington has been my favorite actor.  He has a presence, a style and class, that set him apart, and has become truly expert at picking his projects.  ""Mississippi Masala"" is one of those projects, and I certainly understand his wise selection of this subject matter.
This story of a blossoming romance between a black Mississippi man and a young woman born in Uganda of Asian Indian parents, yet raised in the U.S., certainly has its appeal.  The Indians are a quiet minority in U.S. culture, and it's interesting to see the work of lauded Indian director Mira Nair.  She presents a balanced and realistic view of black family life as well as the little-discussed (in U.S. culture) experience of those Indian people brought to Uganda to work for the British, and who were cast out by dictator Idi Amin in the 1970s for not being black.
The racial themes presented here are fresh and appealing in their interest, and explain a subculture that we Americans rarely consider.  The surprise (for the supporting characters) comes when Washington and gorgeous co-star Sarita Choudhury find themselves intensely attracted to each other.  Her childhood among a black majority makes her interest in Washington quite natural, but only to her as far as the characters in the film are concerned.  It's not just Sarita who is eye candy, but the cinematography in general is beautifully done as well.
Yet something here just doesn't make me fall in love with the movie.  Perhaps it's that the conflict comes too little too late, or that the exposition of the Ugandan experience takes so long to develop that there's not enough room in my mind to fully develop the romance.  As a sheer fan of Washington's work, also, there's just not enough of him to go around for me, and his character is certainly not as fully drawn as many he has played.
Overall I'd say this is well worth a rental, but I wouldn't be interested in seeing it again.  It left me wanting more, which is sometimes a good thing for a film and sometimes a disappointment.  It's a ""little"" story, not a grand epic that could be justified as a three-hour film.  So, maybe the real trouble is that Nair tries to tell too much story in a too-small frame, and doesn't go deep enough into several aspects of the story as I would have liked.  Too bad.",1045872000,12,2318,4.665847665847666
168828,5,0800115066,"Out of all of Denzel Washington's movies, this is probably my favorite.  This is an extremely powerful story of how love can cross ethnic and cultural barriers.

168829,5,0800115066,"Mira Nair's film ""teaches"" without being preachy.  The motion picture explores racism in all its ugly forms.  The story begins with the expulsion of Indians and other Asians from Uganda because ""Africa is for Africans"" and brings one family to America (Mississippi, to be exact).  There the family, specifically the daughter (Sarita Choudhury) in her relationship with a black man (Denzel Washington) experiences some of the same prejudices faced in Uganda.
In one very amusing, yet revealing, series of scenes, various characters ""speak"" to the screen sharing their opinions about other races, as well as those of the same race with a different skin hue.
""Masala"" is a beautiful film with strong performances by Washington, Choudhury, and veteran actors Roshan Seth and Joe Seneca.  The supporting cast also complements a truly entertaining film.
Hopefully, the studio that released the film will re-issue it in video form for others to view this fine production.",977184000,22,964,5.281045751633987
168830,4,0800115066,"Fans of Mira Nair's Oscar nominated SALAAM BOMBAY! will not be disappointed by this unassuming little movie about an interracial romance  in Mississippi.
Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are a pleasure to  watch in this engaging story about a love affair between a Black man (who's  never been to Africa) and an Indian woman (who has never been to India) and  how thier romance causes strife in a small Southern town.
Washington and  Choudhury have amazing chemistry onscreen, transforming this modern day  romance into an updated Romeo & Juliet with a spicy twist. The anxiety  and strife their union causes among family members and town locals is  realistically portrayed  without falling into the trap of being being  preachy or contrived.
Against all this, a subplot in the story revolves  around the loss of a homeland and friendship between Choudhury's proud  Ugandan national father and the Black Ugandan friend he left behind during  Idi Amin's reign of terror.

168863,4,0800115066,"Mississippi Masala, (1992).  In this 118 minute full-color movie, a romance/drama/comedy, Mira Nair (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salaam-Bombay-Widescreen-Special-Edition/dp/B00007KQ9V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salaam Bombay (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsoon-Wedding/dp/B00006AW0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsoon Wedding</a>), paints an illuminating picture of the Indian woman Mina (Sarita Choudhury).

The movie is steamy, romantic, and for sure can be inspirational.  I for one can perfectly understand any woman willing to fight her family for the young Denzel.  He was, of course, a very good actor; but also the possessor of the whitest teeth, the most handsome face, and the most  thrilling set of pecs, of which we get to see quite a lot in this film.  The director gives us Uganda on a plate, in a few scenes, and also does well by her Mississippi setting.  She delivers a particularly strong rendition of the twice-exiled Indian community, contentious and loving, and tells her feel good story with humor, heart and a light touch.  Worth a look, particularly if you've a soft spot for Denzel.",1319673600,,2580,7.496688741721854
168864,4,0800115066,"Films about race relations can be tiring.  They tend to be so one-sided and stereotypical that they defeat their purpose within the film's first few frames.  They tend to take one point of view and dispense with any and all balance to create something that is too one-dimensional to be taken seriously.

With that thought in mind, `Mississippi Masala' was a nice surprise.

That isn't to say that it doesn't have its clear `favorite side', which is surprisingly NOT the skin color that the film's director sports (take a hint Spike Lee), but the way in which Mira Nair sculpts her film allows for a sense of understanding on both sides.  With that mutual understanding, `Mississippi Masala' becomes far more palatable and ultimately far more poignant because it truly understands the relationship of the races and not the relations of one particular race.

The film begins during the expulsion of all Asians (which, obviously, include Indians) from Uganda during the reign of Idi Amin.  One particular family is adversely affected thanks to the outspoken views of the family's patriarch.  Thanks to his public scrutiny of Amin, Jay and his family are forced out of their homeland.  Years later, they are living in Mississippi where an influx of Indian immigrants are making a living with hotels.  Jay spends most of his time sending letters to the Ugandan government, trying to get compensation for the loss of his property when he was expelled from the country.  His wife owns a liquor store and his daughter, Meena, works for a friend's hotel (where they also currently reside).  Meena's parents have hopes that she will marry well, despite the fact that she is darker skinned and they are poor.  Meena happens to fall for a black man; a carpet cleaner named Demetrius.  This doesn't please her family, especially her father who has resentment towards blacks for what he deemed unfair treatment in Uganda.  Consequences of the affair spread to both sides of the family, and prejudices and preconceived notions are brought to a head before internal peace can be achieved.

While there is a lot here that seems `been-there-done-that', Nair's direction is so breezy and crisp that the film feels wholly enjoyable and remarkably fresh.  I particularly loved the way that Nair approached the idea of traditions; wrapping it up in Demetrius's wise analogy concerning `food' (when you hear it you will hear bells go off).  She understands the faults of her own people as well as those of others, and so she creates something grounded as opposed to one-sided.

Her film is propelled by wonderful performances from Denzel Washington, Sarita Choudhury and especially Roshan Seth, who takes his cultural beliefs and embellishes them with a unique personal backstory.  These are soulful performances that elevate the material and make for a very engaging ride.

The film isn't without fault (clichs abound and the age-old formulaic scenario plays out without a hitch) but the film is wonderfully balanced to the point where the good far outweighs the bad.",1315785600,,3045,5.013916500994036
168865,4,0800115066,"I was surprised to find a movie dealing with various topics often overlooked. Sure, there are movies about race relations in the southern US, movies about the Indian diaspora, and movies about African civil wars, but nothing that combines these issues together into a feature film! Young Denzel Washington is one of the biggest stars in the movie, which is clearly a plus as well. I didn't realize what a critical part the Indian community was in Uganda until I saw this, but it makes me want to explore the topic further.

While the movie focuses on the romance between an Indian woman from Africa and an African American man, in the beginning it was hinted that the Indian girl's mother had her own affair with an African man. I'm not sure if that's what really happened, because it was not revealed later on what exactly happened, and how it might have influenced the mother's views about interracial dating. I suppose one could say the fact that the issue was left ambiguous could mean you can decide for yourself what happened, but I think it would have been nice for the movie to tell us that.

Otherwise, though, it's a solid film. Even though it's a little old and wasn't too popular around its release, it is entertaining and eye-opening.",1315008000,,1247,4.663636363636364
168866,4,0800115066,"The DVD has nothing but the movie itself--not a single extra. They could have done a documentary on the 1972 expulsion of people of Indian descent from Uganda which is where this movie starts. It certainly got me interested to wiki info on that especially given we had many Indian immigrants at that time move to Canada from Ugnada.

The story itself is a wonderfully layered look at cultures in collision, ethnic identity and traditions old and new. I felt the weakest link was the female lead Sarita Choudhury. This was her first ever movie so I'll cut her some slack but if you check her imdb filmography that covers 44 appearances in TV and film since then and nothing spectacular stands out. So maybe it was just her. I just wasn't drawn to her character as much as the other Indians in the flick.

Also, considering this came out in 1991, the whole out of Africa setup seems almost eerie when you consider what has happened on the African continent since from Rwanda to the Congo as far as people being displaced (and outright slaughtered in their millions).

Anyway, a very young Denzel Washington is superb in this and strikes just the right tone of a young man trying to make his way in a Mississippi still struggling with its racist past.

The whole racist card, too, is flipped and twisted all around with Indians and blacks in the Deep South having so much in common yet the mixing of these two races causes no end of unintended trouble for both sides in this movie.

It is a story of a family of Asian Indians who are forced to leave Uganda by the authority of Idi Amin in 1972.  After  living in London, England for about 15 years, they move to Greenwood, Mississippi in about 1987; however, the movie plot pauses after the family leaves Uganda then resumes 18 years later in 1990.
  The principal characters in the story are Mina, a young Indian woman of 23 years who was born in Uganda and lives in Greenwood; Jay and Kinnu are Mina's father and mother, also born in Uganda and living in Greenwood; Anil, Pontiac, Jammubhai, and Kanti are members of Mina's extended family living in Greenwood.  Demetrius is a young black man who was born and raised in Greenwood and owns a carpet cleaning service; Tyrone is his business partner and friend.  Williben is Demetrius's widowed father, and Dexter is his brother.
  Mira Nair, the Indian-born director, had previously directed five films including Salaam Bombay!  Since Mississippi Masala, she has directed 16 projects.  Mississippi Masala is Choudhury's first major role, but she has had many movie and television roles since.  Denzel Washington had thirteen movie roles and had won two Oscars prior to his appearance in Mississippi Masala and has been in 29 films since.  Among the other actors, Roshan Seth, who plays Mina's father was previously in Gandhi and a movie in the Indiana Jones series.  Sharmila Tagore plays Kinnu, Mina's mother, and has been acting professionally since 1959, most notably in An Evening in Paris.  Charles S. Dutton plays Tyrone, Demetrius's friend and business partner.  He had been in seven movies previously.  The primary cast is made up of Indians and blacks, but, although there are white characters in the story, none of them have major roles.
  Mina explains that she is a mix masala.  She tells Demetrius that masala is ""a bunch of hot spices"" used in Indian cuisine.  Demetrius picks up on the spicy aspect of the name and occasionally calls her ""Miss Masala.""  It is a name that proves provocative and evocative throughout the film as Mina negotiates four cultures in the movie but is especially caught up in the differences between the Indian and black communities in Greenwood.
  The movie opens with scenes of the family during the last few days before they and all other Indians are expelled from Uganda by Idi Amin in 1972.  Mina is 6 years old at the time and sees her father arrested by the Amin military and watches her mother get harassed by soldiers on the way to the airport as they leave.  Throughout the story both Mina and Jay have flashbacks to life in Uganda which serve to fill in some unresolved aspects of the story during that time.
  The life of the family is picked up in 1990 in Greenwood, Mississippi and shows Mina driving Anil's car while transporting groceries for an upcoming wedding.  While distracted by her mother, she rear ends a carpet cleaning van.  No one is hurt in the crash, but Mina meets Demetrius under those circumstances.  At the wedding, Mina is asked out on a date by Harry Patel, a wealthy bachelor and member of the Indian-American community .  She accepts the invitation, and they go to the Leopard Lounge, a dance club that is frequented primarily by blacks.  In the scenes of her at the Indian wedding and the black night club, we see her comfortable in both settings.  We notice that she has darker skin than both of her parents and most of her fellow Indians, but she is fairer than the black people in the club.  She happens upon Demetrius in the club and reintroduces herself to him and apologizes for the accident.  When he asks her to dance, her uncle excuses himself from the club and the romance begins.
  The storyline of the movie is two-fold.  There is a romance between Mina and Demetrius that develops throughout the movie.  There is also racial tension between the Indian community and the black community.  Although that racial tension is usually not overt or violent, it manifests itself in subtle ways.  Jammubhai, a relative of Anil, the owner of the car that Mina was driving when she rear-ended Demetrius, hires Demetrius to clean the carpets in his motel.  While there, he takes Demetrius and Tyrone some tea and asks them to relax and talks to them.  He tells them that he, like they, and Hispanics are all non-whites and that they have to stick together.  He also asks Demetrius if he is okay after the accident and whether there is any damage to the vehicle.  Demetrius assures him that he is not hurt and that the van is not damaged.  In the end Demetrius assures him that he has no intention of suing over the accident.
  Demetrius pursues Mina romantically.  The first date he takes her on is a picnic at his house in which he asks her to meet his family.  He knows that an ex-girlfriend will show up and he wishes to not be alone during the encounter.  At the picnic Mina proves to be as comfortable in the presence of Demetrius's family and friends as she is with her own family.  After an awkward encounter between Demetrius and his ex-girlfriend, Demetrius takes Mina to the bayou and they go for a walk.  It is during the walk that they share a kiss and the viewer notices that the relationship evolves from one of companionship to something more romantic.  This romance will open the racial tensions between the Indian and black communities.
  Demetrius and Mina begin a telephone romance and see each other when Demetrius stops by the motel where Mina lives and works.  He finally asks her to join him for an overnight trip to Biloxi, Mississippi.  She lies to her father and tells him she would like to go to Biloxi overnight to see Nitou, a cousin.  He is distracted as he assents to the trip.  They go to Biloxi and spend an enjoyable evening and following morning.  It is on this trip that they are shown having sex in their motel room. They are confronted by family members because she is staying in a motel with the black man and that behavior dishonors the family.  That is when the subtle racism turns overt.  The family members barge into the room and disrupt the trip sending Mina and Demetrius to jail.  When they return to Greenwood, Mina has to explain her involvement with a black man to her family and community, and Demetrius has to explain his involvement with an Indian woman to his family and community.  Moreover, Demetrius is ostracized by the community and his business suffers as a result.  The conflict is resolved when Mina finds Demetrius while he is attempting to pick up business in a nearby city.  In the end, the couple agree to stay together and move away from Greenwood.
  At first blush, the concept of the Asian-Indian family as a motel owning entrepreneurship would appear as a clich.  Cruising I-75 one need only get off at nearly any exit and signs will announce a lodging as ""American-owned.""  This advertising plays on the bigotry of the percentage of travelers who dislike foreigners.  Mina addresses the xenophobic travelers who stop at her family's Monte Cristo Motel in Greenwood.  She tells Demetrius, ""You know how many people come to our motel, they look at us and say, `Not another goddam Indian?'  That makes me so mad.""  The conflict between foreign-born entrepreneurs and bigoted white Americans is real.
  On June 22, 1985, The New York Times printed an article about Indian ownership of motels.  The article states, ""According to one estimate, about 15,000, or 28% of the nation's 53,629 motels and hotels were owned by Indians or people of Indian descent.""  That means that on average, if an interstate exit has four or more lodgings, at least one will be owned by an Indian family.  Not only that, the article reads, ""Thousands of the Indian motel owners have the same surname, Patel, but are not necessarily related.""  Furthermore, one owner interviewed for the article says, ""Indians are hard workers.  Families play an important role in making a success of it.""#  All three of these aspects of Indian-American life play an important role in the movie.  The stereotype of the Indian motel owner, the name of Patel as a wealthy bachelor, and the importance of family to the Indian-American community.  What seems at first to be hackneyed may simply be the filmmaker's use of familiar themes to provide a shortcut to the more important plot of the film.
  Though there are no principal actors that are white, there are some minor roles taken by white actors.  Most of those roles involve establishing the white hegemony in the south.  The most important such role is that of Mrs. Morgan, a wealthy white businesswoman who employs Williben, Demetrius's father as a waiter.  She and her husband have given references to the bank so that Demetrius could get a loan to buy a van and machines to start his business.  The two officers who arrest Demetrius and Mina are also white.  Demetrius is reprimanded by a white representative of the Chamber of Commerce who tells him they ""need responsible people, and you're not exactly appropriate.""  The banker who handles the loan is also white. As part of the ostracism, the banker tells Demetrius that his note is being called in.  He must pay it off by the end of the month despite having a two-year history of regular payments.  Finally, when Demetrius decides to sue Anil for the accident, he hires a white attorney to take his case.  Though there are few white people, their presence is significant in that they are the people who control the power, politics, and economy of Greenwood.  They are also the people who, despite disinterest in the racial tensions between the blacks and Indians, act as referees in their dispute.
  The hegemony theme is furthered by Jay's role in Uganda versus his role in America.  In Uganda he was an attorney who advocated for blacks against the powerful Asian-Indians.  He admits that he was among the Indians who helped bring Idi Amin to power and eventually brought about his own expulsion from Uganda.  As a result, Indian hegemony is lost to Amin and the Africans.  In America, Jay and Anil are confronted by Demetrius's white lawyer.  And although Jay tells Anil that Demetrius's suit does not stand a chance, Anil turns to Jay and tells him that not only does he not want Jay's help, he wants Jay and his family to leave.  Anil defers to the hegemony of the white hierarchy over his kin.
  There are three reasons why the white community would take the side of the Indians in their dispute with Demetrius.  The Indians probably have more money than Demetrius.  A survey of the median family incomes of whites, blacks, and Asian Indians in America shows that in 1989, one year before the setting of this movie, the annual income of black families was $22,430; the annual income of white families was $37,630; and the annual income of Asian Indian families was $49,309.#  That material wealth goes a long way in persuading the economic hierarchy to take one's side. Also, the Asian Indians band together in their efforts to ostracize Demetrius.  Conversely, the black community makes no effort to aid Demetrius.  So, while the Indians are working as a team to defeat Demetrius.  Demetrius is without the support of his community.  The third factor is that society traditionally sympathizes with the woman in a dispute between a man and woman.  And, although this is not a dispute between a man and a woman, it is a dispute between a man and a woman's family, Greenwood society has backed the woman's family and left the man to fend for himself.
  The tensions between blacks and Indians are manifest throughout the movie in many other ways.  In one movie review by Indian-American writer Erika Surat Andersen, she maintains, ""Another provocative issue is raised by Okelo, a secondary but significant character in the film.  An alternate reading of his relationship to Mina's family can be drawn from the text, namely, that Okelo is Mina's father.""#  She cites as evidence of this in that a picture of Okelo and Mina is one of the few possessions Kinnu takes from Uganda when they leave.  That picture is a source of tension later in the movie when Jay sees the picture in the liquor store that Kinnu owns.  Jay comes into the store and notices the picture and gets a perturbed look on his face.  He asks, ""Where'd that come from?""  She replies, ""It's always been there.""  Andersen also mentions the farewell scene at the bus station in Uganda.  Okelo and Kinnu ""share an intimate embrace, and get a somewhat hostile look from Jay when he happens upon them.  Mina and Okelo's parting is affectionate and their faces are nose-to-nose in the frame, suggesting their similarity in appearance.""#  The picture mentioned above is also evidence of a similarity of looks between Okelo and Mina.  The third piece of evidence that Andersen mentions is that Mina is darker than her parents.  She refers to herself as a ""darkie"" and is called that by others in her family and the Indian community in Greenwood.  In addition, Kinnu is as comfortable around black men as Mina is.  While working at her liquor store which is situated in the black commercial section of Greenwood she is frequently entertained by Skillet who plays the harmonica and sings improvised flattering lines to her.  She appears to enjoy the attention, and does nothing to discourage him loitering in her store.  Furthermore, following Mina's date with Harry Patel when she shuns her date and allows Demetrius to take her home, she has a short conversation with her mother.  Kinnu asks her about her date and whether she enjoyed herself.  She says she did and asks her mother, ""What happened with Okelo and Papa?""  Her mother gets a concerned look (which Mina does not see) and replies, ""How did that come into your head?""  At the time of the conversation her mother does not know that Mina had begun the night with an Indian man and finished it with a black man.  However, perhaps because of her attraction to Demetrius, suspicions of a relationship between her mother and Okelo had surfaced in her mind during the evening.  Finally, in the story it is revealed that Mina is an only child.  It is possible that Jay is impotent and the only way Kinnu could have a child was through conception by another man.  Had Jay been able to father children, it is likely that Mina would not be an only child.  Only Kinnu knows whether that is the case, and she does not tell Mina or anyone else so the matter of Mina's parentage is never resolved.  Andersen comes to the conclusion, ""If the film-maker had intended such an ambiguity, the message may be that we are all more racially mixed than we know.""#  Furthermore, the masala that is Mina may be spicier than she knows.
  The underlying theme of the movie is racism.  It manifests itself throughout the story.  Near the end of the movie Demetrius tells Mina, ""You didn't tell me your family had trouble with black folks.""  She replies, ""You didn't ask.""  That said, the clues to the racism of the Indian community toward blacks were provided in the movie prior to their arrest.  Many of them were available for Demetrius to discern if he had been paying attention.  The first one occurs when Mina tells Harry Patel that she was going to stay at the club instead of going home with him.  When Demetrius tells Patel that he will drive Mina home, Patel angrily stalks out of the club.  Later, when he drives Mina home from the dance club, he parks in the parking lot and asks if he can escort her to her room.  She politely declines saying, ""I'll be all right.""  He gently pursues it one more time asking, ""You sure?""  She simply says, ""Yeah.""  She gets out of the van and walks to her room alone.  There may be several reasons for her to decline his invitation, but Demetrius fails to discern bigotry on the part of Mina`s family as one of them.  When Demetrius comes to the motel while she is working at the front desk with one of the owners, she treats him like he is a potential guest.  They pursue this charade until the manager leaves to make his rounds, but before Demetrius leaves he asks Mina to go to Biloxi with him.  She makes the arrangements to go, however fraudulently, but instead of riding with him, she takes a bus.  He meets her at a stop by the beach.  It is then that she reveals that she has lied to her father and told him that her father thinks that she is meeting Nitou.  He says, ""I'm Nitou?"" Mina says, ""Yep."" None of these warning signs occur to him that there would be a problem.  Demetrius fails to see these clues; perhaps because Mina is not racist, Demetrius assumes the rest of her family will accept him as well.
  Arranged marriages are a part of the Indian custom.  There is one conversation that leads the viewer to believe that the marriage between Kinnu and Jay was arranged.  While Mina and her mother talk, her mother says, ""You can't fall in love in one day.""  Mina replies, ""You and Papa did.""  That indicates that the marriage between Kinnu and Jay had no courtship and that they may have met for the first time at the altar.  Kinnu smiles at Mina's oversimplified understanding of her parents' relationship, but does not reply.  Arranged marriages are common in Indian communities both in India and around the world.  However, in America, it is difficult for families to arrange marriages without the consent of the couple getting married.  By law, both partners must voluntarily sign a marriage license in front of a representative of the clerk of court.  In Mississippi, men must be at least 17 years old and women 15 unless there is a court order that allows a couple to marry at a younger age.  Therefore, partners must give their consent to a marriage, and parents cannot arrange a marriage without the consent of the marrying parties.  Mina's parents want her to marry Harry Patel.  He is the wealthiest bachelor in the Indian community.  Her mother tells Mina that she is concerned that she will end up ""a spinster.""  Mina tells her mother in no uncertain terms that she is not interested in marrying Patel.
  Neither Mina nor her parents have ever lived in India, but they practiced Indian customs in Africa and brought their religion with them to Mississippi as evidenced by both a marriage and a religious ceremony that were shown in the movie.  Their views on marriage survive their emigrations as well.  This is not unusual as Padma Srinivasan and Gary R. Lee in their research on Indian customs contend:
 Processes of modernization and social change tend to eventuate in the gradual  disappearance of customs such as the bride-price or dowry, along with arranged  marriage customs in general.  Indian arranged marriages and the accompanying  dowry system have proved to be extremely resistant to social change, however.#

Though her parents would like Mina to choose an Indian to marry, Mina never allows Harry Patel's pursuit of her to get to the point of anyone talking about a dowry, wedding, or second date, for that matter.  Furthermore, according to Binita Mehta in her essay, ""Race, Color, and Identity in Mira Nair's Mississippi Masala,"" she says:
 Although Indian immigrants wanted to prosper in Ugandan society, and were  prepared to become Ugandan citizens, they were unwilling to give up caste and  cultural differences...For example, marriage within one's caste or sub caste was  rigidly followed, and needless to say, marriage between black Africans and Indians  was completely out of the question.#

Mina also refuses to go back to Uganda where she may be forced to succumb to an arranged marriage.  She grew up from the age of six with western traditions in London, and by the time she reaches Mississippi is a woman fully engaged in western values who has shunned Indian traditions.  In fact, when Mina decides to leave Greenwood with Demetrius, she does so without the personal protection of family nor the legal protection of a marriage--certainly breaking with Indian tradition.
  Any attempts by the Indians (with the exception of Mina) to relate to blacks are for selfish reasons, either to help their business or to discourage Demetrius from suing them.  Jammubhai approaches Demetrius and Tyrone early in the movie, and throws out lines like, ""If you're not white, you're colored,"" ""All us people of color must stick together,"" and ""United we stand; divided we fall.""  This is a device used to show solidarity with the blacks in order to discourage Demetrius from suing Anil over the accident.  Demetrius, recognizing the intent of Jammubhai's faade,  facetiously replies with clichs like, ""Right on, Brother"" and ""Power to the people.""  The Indian characters do not see the ridicule in these rejoinders.  This satire makes the Indians look foolish, and Andersen in her criticism of Mississippi Masala takes issue with the extent of that depiction.  She says, ""The Indian community is shown to be greedy, petty, and ridiculous.  If a non-Indian film-maker had portrayed such characters, there would have been public outcry at the racist stereotypes.""  They are also depicted as poor fighters, and as the insinuation is that Jay is unable to father a child, Indians are further depicted as impotent.  Andersen argues that ""the black characters in Mississippi Masala are much more three-dimensional.""#  That would indicate that they are depicted as less gullible and more mature.  However, one could argue that the black community in Greenwood is depicted as being less supportive of one of its successful citizens than would be the case in other black communities.#  The barber in town sums up the black community's behavior as he is preparing to cut Demetrius's hair:
 You know we're just as bad as everybody else.  Black folks don't like to see other  black folks do good.  I tell them that you worked hard to get where you are.  They  don't want to hear that.  The just sit on their butts and wait for you to fall on your  face.  And when you do they're just as happy.

As for Andersen's criticism of the movie's depiction of Indians, there would be few successful entrepreneurs who are actually greedy, petty, and gullible to the point of ridicule.  The foibles of both communities are exaggerated in order to expedite the message.
  My primary criticism of the movie is that the filmmakers used law enforcement as the bad guys by having them arrest Demetrius and Mina.  If the officers were to have followed the protocol of ""probable cause,"" they would have arrested the people who barged into the Demetrius's motel room illegally.  Any officer worth his salt would have taken control of the situation and asked, ""Who rented this room?""  Those who were in the room without permission would have been arrested for criminal trespass and other offenses.  The filmmakers could have found a more plausible means of creating a confrontation between the Indians and Demetrius and Mina.  Instead they went for the cheap shot.  This is not the first movie to do that, and it won't be the last, but for those who know anything about the law, it is a method that shows a lack of effort and imagination.
  While walking on the beach in Biloxi, Mina and Demetrius discuss the race issue.  Demetrius responds that in Mississippi they call racism traditional thinking.  ""Racism is like recipes.  They get passed down.  Now, the trick is that you got to know what to eat and what to leave on your plate.  Otherwise, you'll be mad forever.""  Mina counters, ""Or you'll never eat.""  The viewer sees the extent of the racism among the Greenwood Indians in two scenes.  Following the arrest of Demetrius and Mina, Jay and Jammubhai are sitting in what appears to be an empty courtroom.  They are there to receive Mina from the authorities and take her home (perhaps after having paid her bail).  Tyrone walks into the same room and extends a hand of friendship to the Indians, but they ignore him.  Later, when Demetrius goes to the Monte Cristo Motel and asks to see Mina, Jammubhai pages Jay to the front desk instead.  Demetrius says that he is pleased to finally meet Mina's father and he extends a hand to him, but his attempt at civility is also ignored.  He is also told that he will not be allowed to see Mina.  His argument that she is a grown woman falls on deaf ears.  And though these are serious, evocative scenes in the movie, the movie, on the whole, is light-hearted.
  With all the conflict of racism, marriage, and questions of whether Mina's Papa is her father, one would assume that Mississippi Masala is a drama.  However, it is a comedy, not just because the boy gets the girl in the end and nobody dies, but because there is humor embedded throughout the story.  In her review, Erika Surat Andersen says, ""Mississippi Masala is surprisingly humorous, and while the satire is at times at the expense of believable characters, at other times it proves enjoyably enlightening.""#  It is the idea that racial conflicts can be depicted as ""enjoyably enlightening"" that makes this movie stand out from others in which there is more drama and less fun.  Stereotyping the conflicting communities is one of the devices used by the filmmakers to make the film humorous instead of dramatic.  The only violence in the film is the confrontation in the motel room.  Anil, the instigator, is shown to be an inept fighter--especially against Demetrius.  He is injured in the fight and wears a bandage on his nose through the remainder of the movie.
  Most films that have racism as their motif choose a story line that is either hegemonic or anti-hegemonic.  In this case the story is about which community is going to come out in second place behind the white power structure.  Is it going to be the black community that follows American principles or the Indian community that still adheres to Asian principles and mores?  The answer is that when the two communities collide, they both lose.  The blacks lose one of their more successful businessmen and the Indians lose one of their hard-working women.  The Indians would have been well-advised to have followed the clichs that they espoused in order to merely protect their property.  Those principles would have also protected their family.  The conflict between the blacks and Indians has not harmed the white power structure at all, and in the end the white hegemony is even more entrenched in Greenville society.",1277078400,2,26434,4.757482394366197

There are two plots. The first protagonist is Jay (Roshan Seth), a Ugandan lawyer of Indian descent, who - along with his wife, Kinnu (Sharmila Tagore), and daughter, Meena - is expelled from Uganda during the reign of Idi Amin. The family moves to Mississippi, where it joins a community of Indian expatriates who dominate the bayou's motel industry. For twenty years, Jay lives and breathes nostalgia for Uganda, and he dreams incessantly of returning to their home. Meanwhile, Meena has grown into Sarita Choudhury, the second protagonist, a self-described masala of cultures. Like her father, Meena yearns to be free of Mississippi. One day, she gets into a fender bender with an African American carpet cleaner, Demetrius (Denzel Washington). The two bump into each other again at a nightclub, and begin dating. As the couple falls in love, both the Indian and African American communities react with shocked, racist indignation.

Now, even though the romance is more obviously the main narrative, Jay's story of forced migration is given equal weight in the film. Indeed, the film ends with Jay's story, Meena's having wrapped up several scenes earlier. This works well because the stories complement each other perfectly: both Jay and Meena are part of a fluid, transplanted diaspora, and both come up against the over-simplifying use of skin color as a ""defining"" ethnic trait. As Jay says: ""I am Ugandan first, Indian second."" Meanwhile, Demetrius' layabout brother (Tico Wells) notes that Meena is just like them: an Indian who has never been to India, like they're Africans who have never been to Africa. Thus both Jay and Meena's story show how this cultural identification is often superficial and imposed: essentially, Jay and Meena are African and Demetrius is American, but their skin color confuses these definitions in onlookers' eyes.

Similarly, the way Jay and Meena react to these ethnic ambiguities is different. Jay still grieves for something his Ugandan friend, Okelo, told him in 1972: ""Africa is for Africans. Black Africans."" As Jay sees it, even with good will, ""race"" cannot be overcome - his best friend's ultimate betrayal demonstrated that. Jay becomes part of the problem, even, when he refuses to accept Demetrius on the basis of skin color. Yet Meena points out that despite Okele's words, his actions demonstrated a friendship and love that did surmount race. Indeed, when Jay returns to Uganda, Okele's sacrifice is confirmed. And Meena shows that ""race"" can be a hollow concept, as she chooses a relationship with Demetrius without hesitation or thought of their racial differences.

It goes without saying that the acting is very good. As we've mentioned before, Roshan Seth really only worked in these sorts of postcolonial roles (can you imagine him in some naach-gaana?!), and he was great in them. He also lucked out in being given a couple of wonderful scenes, thanks mostly to the editing: both moments when Jay is transported back to Uganda via a photo or a phrase, and we have alternating shots of Roshan Seth looking distant, and a vibrant, Elysial Uganda of yore.

In her first role, Sarita Choudhury was acceptable as Meena, though the real weight of the relationship came from Denzel Washington's gravitas. Had it been left up to Sarita, we don't think it would have been as compelling or believable - in a way, her rough edges showed. Denzel, however, was reliably good, and he was also charming as ever. The various other cast members - with some familiar faces from other 90s postcolonial and Bollywood films - were fine. We should note Konga Mbandu, who had the brief but critical role of Okelo. The scene when Jay and his family is leaving is heartwrenching, thanks mostly to Konga's obvious yet restrained suffering.

We highly recommend this film for any viewer, whether ye be a lover of Hindi cinema or not, as it touches on such universal themes of migration, home, and the flimisiness (or inflexibility?) of ""ethnicity"".

This movie touches on the origins of the immigrant status of the South Asians which began when they were expelled from Uganda many years earlier. The resentment towards blacks is a recurring theme in the movie as they settle into their new communities in the deep south. This movie has a bouncy music score that adds flavor to the story and a nice cast weaves everything together in fine style.

168882,4,0800115066,"This is a master piece which touches delicate subject of racism. This time between South asian Indian girl ( played by sexy saritha ) and black guy (played by charming Denzel). The movie gives glimpse of lesser know Indian culture for Americans. How some Indians although almost as dark as africans still stick to racist thinking. It shows being victim of racism doesn't insulate one to treat others the same way. However the movie is balanced and doesn't exploit the situation. Denzel is really charming with boyish look courting a young girl although ignorant of the culture. The love making scene is very romantic and steamy although there is little nudity. Sarity is sultry and ravishing. The movie is not preachy and yet has a hidden message. That one can come of self made shell if we take some risk and accept the reality. The movie covers 2 themes, family life in Uganda, Life in deep south Missisipi (the accent tells it all).  The movie covers delicate topic very realistically and funny at times. However we somehow feel that problem of racism is not digged deeper at the end.  Worth seeing just to see skilled Denzel !",1198886400,4,1130,4.730964467005077
168883,5,0800115066,"After writing my review on 'Something New, people are going to assume I hate IR unions when that simply is not the case, I like a great film that explores more than just the surface on IR unions. The producers, female actors, and director of ""Something New"" were so arrogant promting the movie like their movie was going to change the paradigm of IR amongst Black Women. Well 15 years ago I saw and happen to own the best American and most realistic movie on the subject of mixed relationships that explores the race, class, regional, multicultural issues of romance it is ""Mississippi Masala"".

Mira Nair (who has directed other classics) shot this work of art in 1992 starring Denzel Washington, Joe Senca, Charles S. Dutton, Mohan Agashe, and Sarita Choudhury in this multi- layered film that explores all those themes in a realistic setting. The film is stunning in the price each charcter plays in their pursuit of some sort of redemption in their lives. Race in the south is at the forefront, but so is class, ethnic and racial politics and ultimately love in a film that at least explores other types of mixed relationships that I think is the key to finding at least racial co-existence in this country. Nair has created a work of art that will open your heart long after the film ends.

This is the film that the makers of 'Something New' could not have made because of their arrogance.",1172188800,4,1395,4.6437246963562755

168885,5,0800115066,"This is an amazing movie and one I'm happy to have in my collection. The story is definitely not face-paced but has fine detail throughout. You get a feel for the diverse characters that inhabit this story involving: two continents, four cultures and the subtlety of various shades of skin tones. The love story is good but is enhanced by the subplot involving an East Indian's family exodus from their home in Africa. I guess you'd call it a drama? Hey, I don't know but there are multiple opportunities to share the characters' moments of irony, comedy and yes, love.

The real lesson here is- aren't we all just a couple of shades away from being labeled, defined or characterized by someone else's reality? You might be surprised what label has been attached to you!",1152057600,5,770,4.703703703703703
168886,4,0800115066,"Mississippi Marsala begins in Uganda, as Idi Amin expels all the non-African landowners, turning their homes and property back to the Africans. Many Indians were brought to Africa to build roads and remained to raise their families and future generations. One of these men, Jay (Roshan Seth), a lawyer, is forced to leave with his wife and small daughter, Mina. Eventually the family moves to Mississippi, where other relatives and friends have set down roots, in this case, all of them living in the Motel Monte Cristo, owned by one of their group of exiles. Life goes on as usual, the rituals, traditions and holidays of an India many of them have never even seen.

Mina (Sarita Choudury) has grown up, still living with her parents at twenty-four, a dutiful daughter. While her mother works in a liquor store and Mina cleans rooms at the motel, Jay spends the years suing the government of Uganda for redress of his property, still trapped in memories of the world he was forced to leave. When Mina has a minor car accident, she meets Demetrius (Denzel Washington), a man who has his own business, a carpet cleaning service, with his best friend T-Bone (Charles S. Dutton). Mina and Demetrius carry on a low-key romance that gradually becomes more intense. When Mina's relatives spot the couple at a motel in Biloxi, a fight breaks out, revealing the harsh racial truths that have so far lain dormant. Suddenly no one wants to use the carpet cleaning service, so Demetrius retaliates by suing Mina's cousin, who broke into the motel room. How the couple resolves their differences isn't as important as the social issues that are exposed.

The cinematography is excellent, the African countryside awash with color and change, as the exiled gather their few belongings and board a shabby bus. Equally as striking is the Indian community gathered at the Motel Monte Cristo, the rooms decorated with the few cultural artifacts they have collected over the years. The Indians retain the spirit and enthusiasm that defines them. Demetrius' family is equally impressive, warm and accepting of Mina, sharing their home and hospitality. Watching both of these families as they deal with everyday concerns, it is shocking to see how easily misunderstanding can break down communication, separating the wonderful characters into ""us"" and ""them"", an exact mirror of the issues in Uganda that left Jay's family homeless. Demetrius challenges Jay, decrying the Indian's sense of entitlement, the Indians' value of property. He suggests that ""home is where the heart is"", not off in some distant land that they may never return to, a lesson Jay will learn all too well. This exuberant film from director Mira Nair dishes up a cultural feast of color and emotion, contrasting the customs of people who share the same heart.

168887,5,0800115066,"Mississippi Masala is indeed a different kind of interracial love story.  It involves a black man (Denzel Washington) and an East Indian woman from Uganda(Sarita Choudhury). When Mina is a little girl, she and her family, along with the Indian population as a whole, are expelled from their homeland with little more than the clothes on their backs when Idi Amin comes into power.  Eventually they settle in Greenwood Mississippi and by this time, Mina is a grown woman.  Her father Jay (Roshan Seth), who was a well off lawyer in Uganda, spends most of his time suing the Ugandan government in hopes of getting his property back and going home.  Her mother runs a local liquor store.  They live in a motel owned by their cousin and Mina helps earn their stay by cleaning bathrooms there.  Demetrius owns a successful carpet cleaning business in Greenwood and lives with his father (Joe Seneca) who buses tables at a local restaurant and his little brother (Tico Wells) who simply hangs out doing nothing all day.  He meets Mina when she slams a car into the back of his van and initially gives her attention only to make his ex girlfriend jealous but finds himself falling in love with her.  When their families find out, it all hits the fan.  Some of the reaction is funny but much of it is very sad as well.

Just as compelling as the love story itself is the relationship between the Indian and Black communities and Jay's own emotional struggles.  The Indians are looked down on by the local whites yet they themsleves look down on the local blacks.  The Indian hotel owner tells Demetrius and his partner that people of color should unite yet forgets his own words when he finds out about Demetrius' relationship with Mina.  Demetius is already resented by some of his own people because of his success and his relationship with a non-black woman only makes matters worse.  Mina's family, already marginalized because of their fall from prosperity and their dark complexions (yes it's an issue among Indians too), are marginalized even more.  Both Demetrius, who thought that Mississippi was changing for the better, and Mina, who always identified with black culture and never had any apparent racial hangups, are unpleasantly surprised by it all.  Before I spoil anything, let me just say that most should find the ending positive and satisfying.",1114300800,3,2354,4.818407960199005
168888,4,0800115066,"The movie presented the timeless story of people from other cultures breaking cultural barriers to find love.  Similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie winds up speaking for more than just the cultures presented.  Better than the Greek Wedding movie, this presents two sides of the cultural divide, and provides a wider range of emotional challenge.  Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are outstanding in the leads, and the supporting cast puts in a very strong strong.

168890,5,0800115066,"If you aren't familiar with Mira Nair, the brilliant Indian filmmaker who has brought us magnificent (and more recent films) like Monsoon Wedding, this is a great introduction to her genius.  I happen to be a Denzel Washington fan, and wanted to see his earlier work, which led me to rent this film.
It is set in the South, and is centered on Meena (Sarita Chudhury), an young, ethnically-Indian, Ugandan national who immigrated to the Southern United States with her parents after the uprising of Idi Amin (Ugandan president) who decided that the way to rid the nation of the ""Asian problem"" was to expel them from the country to begin with.  She settles in the States, cleaning hotel bathrooms with her Mum, and living with her parents as a 24 year old woman.  Demetrius (Denzel Washington) is a young African-American man who cleans carpets and helps support his family and stays out of trouble.  What initially starts out as a ""rebound"" relationship turns into something more--which upsets both sets of families.  Though, Meena and Demetrius are outcast in a White culture, there are still divisions between their races that are reinforced by their parents and relatives.  It also is an interesting juxtaposition of Meena's family and their experiences with Black Ugandans (ethnic Indians as the ultimate ""untouchables"" in the African nation), and how Indians in the U.S. South are viewed in comparison with African-Americans who endured White racism, and, before that, slavery and great oppression for many years.
The acting is beautiful in this film, and the love story of the interracial couple is engaging, funny, and touching.  For Mira Nair buffs---she makes an appearance in the wedding scene, early on, as one of the gossipy guests!  Hint:  She has short black hair.......
Don't miss this beautiful, heartfelt and thoughtful film.",1084492800,7,1842,5.072847682119205

This little gem of a film has not only stood the test of time, but is quietly growing in stature.  Certainly one of the better efforts in Denzel Washington's body of work.
Other commentators have noted how good of job Nair does in making this film a ""Masala"" at many levels.  Everything from the story, to the actors, the sets, the lighting and much else besides communicates and celebrates the vibrancy of life and of culture.  Another sometimes overlooked aspect of the film's appeal is that this story is emblematic; we all KNOW and can relate to these characters, because we sense that they are based on real people.
This is a dignified story, told with passion and humor and spice.  In short, this film is exactly what the title says it is.  In short it's a wonderful slice of life.

7792959,5,0800115066,"I usually love watching Bollywood films, all though this is not Bollywood, however, it is a beautiful film about Indian culture here in America.

The film begins in 1972 when Idi Amin expelled Asians from Uganda. This included Jay (Roshan Seth) his wife, Kinnu (Sharmila Tagore), and their daughter, Mina (Sarita Choudhury), a family of third-generation Ugandan Indians residing in Kampala. It then moves forward to 1990. After spending a few years in England, Jay, Kinnu, and Mina have relocated in 1987 to Greenwood, Mississippi to live with family members who own a chain of motels there. Kinnu obtains work in a liquor store and Mina works for the motel of her extended family there (the Monte Cristo). She falls in love with Demetrius (Denzel Washington), a local African American self-employed carpet cleaner. The respective families erupt in turmoil after the pair are discovered and confronted by members of the Indian family during a clandestine weekend of pleasure in Biloxi. Ultimately, the two families cannot come to terms with the interracial pair, who flee the state together in Demetrius's van. After a brief return to Kampala to attend a court proceeding on the disposition of his confiscated Ugandan house, Jay relinquishes his long-nurtured dream of returning to Uganda, the place he considered home.

I hope this beautiful film makes it to Blu-ray someday.",1470009600,,1376,5.165919282511211
