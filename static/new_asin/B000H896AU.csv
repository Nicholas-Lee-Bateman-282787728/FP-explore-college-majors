8137530,3,B000H896AU,"This was not a poorly done film, save in that they had access to one of my 'generals', General Grant (the Grant from my film on Amazon.com entitled the Surrender at Appomattox (2007)). Tony Daniels is an excellent Grant, and our Lee, Dave Palmer, is the best Lee I have worked with to date ( I have also worked with the Lee in this film, in my early works, but I now work exclusively with Dave Palmer).

My one main hang-up with this film is that the generals are not showcased as well as they deserve to be seen... Powers Booth styled voiceovers are okay, but these men with whom I work, (Tony Daniels, in this film) have the actual surrender memorized! To not use them to the best advantage was a waste of great talent. I know. Tony and Dave do this several times a year, and absolutely live the parts!",1257811200,3,804,4.2894736842105265
