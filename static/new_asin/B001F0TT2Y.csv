8300604,5,B001F0TT2Y,"I like the Tomie films.  I like the concept of a demon that drives males insane to the point that they kill her but she keeps on reappearing in order to continue to wreak havoc in their lives.  At first I was a little disappointed that Tomie was not played by the same actress in all of the films, but I came to appreciate the different interpretations that each of the players brought to the series. This is a good twofer - if you like Japanese horror these are worth checking out.",1440720000,,482,4.228260869565218
8300605,3,B001F0TT2Y,"If you are a fan of the Tomie series, then this double feature is your best bet to see these films.  Both films were shot on video productions, and have shorter run times then the theatrical releases in the series.

Beginning is a kind of origin story for the character of Tomie, and it actually follows the original manga story pretty closely.  While the movie does have a shot on video look, the director is still able to create a product that looks very strong.  The acting all around is very good, with the actress who plays Tomie turning in a great performance.  Unlike some of the other films, Tomie has to carry a lot of dramatic weight in this script, and I was very impressed with how engaged.  The film has a very strong script that keeps the movie going at a brisk pace, while still keeping the story, and the character's motivations, clear.  As with some of the other Tomie films, there continues to be a pretty strong lesbian undertone in the material, but it feels natural in this particular case, and helps to enhance the film, instead of feeling like some tacked on exploitation.  Overall, Tomie: Beginning is a strong entry into the film series that follows much closer to the original source material then some of the other films.

Revenge is a mess.  There is no other way to describe the film.  While bits and pieces of the movie are entertaining, it suffers from a lack of focus, and also features one of the all time most random endings I have ever seen in a film.  The story does not really tie into the main Tomie mythology, and instead focuses on a young, female doctor and her relationship with her patient, as well as the search for a missing group of college students (who everyone seems to be able to find fairly quickly once the plot calls for it).  One of the missing students is the daughter of the doctor's boss, and wouldn't you know it, she has a little beauty mark under her eye. The movie has some interesting ideas, and some very shocking imagery towards the end, but it never uses the material to its full effect, instead choosing to focus on an awkward, implied lesbian subplot, while pushing the actual Tomie story to the sidelines (and Tomie with it).  This is also one of the few films in the series where people are not only aware of Tomie, but also the effect that she has on those around her.  While Revenge is entertaining in parts, it is one of the weakest films in the Tomie series (and Tomie really only plays a minor role in the whole story.)

Technically the discs are strong.  While both films look low budget, the image is still crisp and clear, and the audio is strong through out.  I also noticed no glaring spelling, or grammatical errors in the subtitles.

Over all, I would recommend the set to those who are already fans of the Tomie series.  If you are a newbie, start with Rebirth and RePlay, and save these ones for later.",1396396800,4,2885,4.459047619047619
8300606,5,B001F0TT2Y,"I love all the Tomie films! This is the 6th and 7th entry to the great ""Tomie"" franchise. ""Beginning"" is my favorite of the two on this double feature pack, as a prequel is always nice to a great franchise. ""Beginning"" gets into more detail of the one-eyed patch kid from the first ""Tomie"" film, his first encounter with Tomie, and how he lost his eye. ""Revenge"" was an ok story, my gripe is because Tomie doesn't get much airtime on this one in my opinion. Yes, I know that a central character other than Tomie is always the focus of each film but there were still more airtime on Tomie on the others. You don't really get much Tomie on ""Revenge"" until towards the end. Overall this is a great double feature! For any Tomie fans that are missing the last 2 Tomie films ""Tomie Vs Tomie"" and ""Tomie Unlimited"", I had to order them on ebay cause for some reason no one here on Amazon has them. They are only available outside the US since they have not been distributed for the US market, so it is a lengthy shipping, but for any Tomie fan it's worth the wait. A multi-region player is needed for the last 2 films. So unless you have all 9 films, your Tomie collection is not complete.",1359590400,6,1183,4.285714285714286
