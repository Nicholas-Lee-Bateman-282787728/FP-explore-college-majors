4993046,3,B006JFY6HS,"With this DVD you finally get the previosly un-released (on DVD) episode ""The Chipettes"" in which The Chipmunks and Chipettes meet for the first time. But apart from that - well, if you have the DVDs ""Cinderella, Cinderella"" and ""The Chipettes"" you've seen the rest of the episodes before. There is Alvie's Angels, May The Best Chipmunk Win, Tell it To The Judge, My Fair Chipette and Greatest Show-Offs on Earth.
It's a nice little collection if you haven't seen the episodes before, but otherwise I don't know if it's worth its price just to get one single episode. I thought at least the episode where they moved in with miss Miller would be included.",1331164800,20,654,4.695652173913044
4993047,3,B006JFY6HS,"These eepisodes have been released on DVD before. They should do a DVD containing the following Chipette episodes: The Chipettes Story, Help wanted Mommy, My Pharaoh Lady, Just One of the Girls, Goin Down to Dixi, Quarterback in Curlers, Queen of the High school Ballroom, Hearts and Flowers, The Legend of the Sleeping Brittany and The Princess and The Pig.",1329264000,10,358,4.983333333333333
4993048,3,B006JFY6HS,I love the old cartoon & at th risk of being hated hated live action movie 1 & 2  because it really had very little to do with the classic cartoon.  While I love the running for School president episode  It's been done on DVD just a few years ago.  Why not the episode of the Chippettes oragin or  better yet how  Miss miller became their foster mom (with them almost getting split up into 3 foster families. a real heart wrencher  something that illistrates their bond of sisterhood. Or that parody of moonlighting that was funny.  There is a wide variaty of great episodes  yet to be brought out  why so many  warmed over leftovers?,1327708800,4,634,4.379310344827586

4993052,1,B006JFY6HS,"Not bad...just the chipmunks have a bit too much of a human face and not a chipmunk face.  sounds silly, but even my 4 year old found it strange........",1413763200,3,152,4.241379310344827

4993054,4,B006JFY6HS,"I remember some of these from when I was a kid. They are cute and short, perfect for kiddos. My daughter loves this video and I don't mind listening to it in the background either. A decent assortment of shows all featuring the Chipette's.",1399334400,4,239,4.454545454545454
4993055,5,B006JFY6HS,"My daughter loves these, they are fun to sing along with. However, I had a three day guaranteed shipping which took almost 8 days! I was really annoyed because we wanted this for when a few of her cousins were coming over, and it wasn't there. It shipped out within an hour of ordering it, and it say on a truck for four days within my town!! Amazons customer service was delightful and said if it wasn't delivered within that day they were going to expedite me another one through another carrier. This one was through lasership and apparently they like to not fulfill ""guaranteed"" delivery dates for everyone.",1396483200,6,611,4.614678899082569

4993061,5,B006JFY6HS,"My daughter loves this DVD. She has had since she was 5 and still occasionally likes to pop it in (she is 6+ now). I suppose the voices are cute if you are a kid. As an adult, I usually have to leave the living room after a couple of episodes, unless I manage to focus my attention on something else...",1379980800,,302,3.9672131147540983

8499385,1,B006JFY6HS,"MINUS 5 stars!  My daughter was interested in watching the Chippettes after seeing the Chipmumks movie so I looked this up and watched the video clip.  It opened with the Chipmunks and Chipettes in an ode to ""Charlie's Angels.""  There were cartoon women shaking their buttocks in bikinis while washing cars.  WHAT?  Did everyone reviewing this miss that scene?  No thank you to misogyny in my daughter's cartoons.",1510358400,,413,5.0

8499388,4,B006JFY6HS,"My daughters were hoping for a movie based on ""The Chipette Diaries"". This is not that. It is a compilation of old Alvin and the Chipmunk episodes. The cover art makes it look like it will be animation that looks like the cover... but there are some cartoons that are very simple/old version of the chipmunks. nonetheless, they enjoy most of the episodes.",1461715200,,355,4.650793650793651
8499389,5,B006JFY6HS,Great,1452643200,,5,5.0
8499390,1,B006JFY6HS,"Another Awful release. Again, no openings or closing credits. The older releases have the openings with the cartoons so I took a chance on this one. I wish they would do box sets already. This DVD had stupid cursive pink writing before each cartoon. I guess that's the end of my review because I can't say any more of what I said before.",1448841600,,337,4.365079365079365

8499392,5,B006JFY6HS,"Even though they are from when I was a kid and are not the jump off the screen 3D characters that my daughter is accustomed to seeing on NickJr and DisneyJunior she loves these old Chipmunk DVD's I've ordered for her.  I've almost ordered the complete collection now.  They keep her attention and she follows the plot well.  I like the modern cartoons but it seems like today they are all about learning/teaching (colors, numbers, shapes, letters etc.)  I wanted to introduce her to something that was just pure entertainment that was like the cartoons I had when I was a kid and these DVD's are exactly what I was looking for.

This DVD includes 5 Chipette Episodes  ""The Chipettes"" where The Chipmunks and Chipettes meet for the first time, Alvie's Angels, May The Best Chipmunk Win, Tell it To The Judge, My Fair Chipette and Greatest Show-Offs on Earth.

If you are looking for the new 3D Chipmunks episodes on DVD this is NOT it these are the old episodes from the 80's reformated to DVD's.  They are a great way to share a bit of pop culture and things from the past with this generation.
