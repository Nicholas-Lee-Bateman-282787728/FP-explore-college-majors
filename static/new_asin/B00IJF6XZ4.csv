8642542,5,B00IJF6XZ4,"THE COMPLETE DR. PHIBES [1971/1972] [2 Discs Special Limited Edition] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Love Means Never Having To Say Youre Ugly! Nine Killed Her; Nine Shall Die, Nine Eternities in Doom!

Horror legend Vincent Price of The Fall of the House of Usher and Theatre of Blood is Dr. Phibes, former musician, current murderer. Seeking revenge from the medical staff that left his wife for dead, he sets about knocking them off one-by-one in a series of elaborate murders based upon a Ten Plagues of Egypt. Death by bats, by boils, by blood and more await the nurse and surgeons who failed to save the life of the beloved Victoria Regina Phibes!

A camp classic, The Abominable Dr. Phibes sets itself apart from the seventies horror crowd with its knowing humour and art deco sets, and also prefigures the Saw movies with its increasingly fiendish set of murder devices.

Pairing the original film with sequel Dr. Phibes Rises Again and The Complete Dr. Phibes provides viewers with a double diabolical dose of macabre thrills and black comedy.

FILM FACT: Dr. Phibes takes his inspiration for the murders from the Old Testament, the Ten plagues of Egypt. The plagues described in the movie differ slightly from the Biblical account: Boils; Bats; Frogs; Blood; Hail; Rats; Beasts; Locusts; Death of the first born and Darkness.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The world of show business can be fickle when it comes to age. Most actors find they have a limited shelf life when it comes to getting starring roles. Even the greatest names often find themselves side-lined in favour of shining new and young talent. However, one actor who went against the grain was Vincent Price who enjoyed a diverse career on the stage and in film thrillers, comedy, noir, and small horror roles and did not find his niche until he hit his 1940s. At the age of 42, Vincent Price starred in the 3D Stereoscopic House of Wax [1953], catapulting him into the arena within which he would later become a household name. There are not many people who deserve the title of an icon; however, Vincent Price is definitely one for that coveted title and of course, alongside actors such as Peter Cushing, who also had a very similar history finding his place in horror at a later age than many others. Vincent Prices journey from House of Wax 3D, would see him work almost exclusively in horror for many years. In 1971, at the age of 60, he made The Abominable Dr. Phibes a film that, alongside Theatre of Blood [1973], could be considered his swansong. The following year saw the revival of the Dr. Phibes character in Dr. Phibes Rises Again a flamboyant and camp extravaganza of a sequel that paid no attention to issues such as continuity which in this reviewers opinion, did not suffer one bit as a result, although, some may argue otherwise. But to sum up everything, this brilliant 2 Blu-ray Discs Special Limited Edition from Arrow Academy has brought together these two films in a newly restored stunning Blu-Ray edition double disc collectors pack that is limited to just 3000 units and surely to be one of their most highly anticipated releases so far.

To appreciate both films you have to ignore the connection between the two to some extent; just accept both take place in the Dr. Phibes universe, paying little relation to one another in terms of continuity. The Dr. Phibes universe is a weird and wonderful place, an avant garde celebration of camp, over the top horror/comedy that is unique to anything that came before or after for that matter. Even though the films supposedly take place sometime in 20s/30s, they seem to have no grounding in anything other than pure imagination. On this basis, the Dr. Phibes universe can encompass ludicrous ideas and concepts, making them appear perfectly acceptable to the audience. Such is the skill of director Robert Fuest, who directed both instalments, and the enigmatic performance by Price. In the case of both films, you can immerse yourself in the pure fantasy they deliver, something rare in todays climate of ultra-realism in genre flicks.

The Abominable Dr. Phibes sees Vincent Price portray the ominous Dr. Anton Phibes. Heavily disfigured in an accident and an idea that harks back to his previous role in the House of Wax 3D. Dr. Phibes is a tragic character who, grieving for his late wife Victoria [Caroline Munro], sets out to punish the medical staff he believes failed her. So it is that the doctor sets about constructing an elaborate, and quite honestly mind-bending, series of revenge murders based on the plagues of Egypt. Aided by his assistant, the hypnotic Vulnavia [Virginia North] with her outstanding array of fantastical seventies retro-chic costumes, Dr. Phibes sets to task punishing the team who worked on his wife, as she lay dying on the operating table. The deaths flow at a furious pace: death by bats, rats, and an elaborate frog mask at a masquerade, locusts, and other hideous concepts like bloodletting, all served up with panache and an extra dose of wickedly black comedy.

The performance Vincent Price puts in has to be one of the greatest and most memorable of his career. Inhabiting many of the elements the actor had become well known for in his previous genre roles as a tormented lunatic, grief stricken widower, genius villain, and tragic figure and it could almost be considered a pastiche of Vincent Prices career in horror. The humour is fiercely dark and dry; yet, the horrific elements manage to ground the film, preventing it from becoming a complete parody. Vincent Prices performance is mesmerising and his on-screen presence dominates the picture. When you consider Dr. Phibes vocal chords have been damaged, and he therefore can only speak with the aid of an impromptu gramophone device, resulting in very little dialogue for Vincent Price, his portrayal becomes even more of a marvel. Vincent Price manages to convey the most subtle of emotions simply through a series of facial expressions: a raise of an eyebrow here and there, a steely glare.

For the supporting cast, Robert Fuest enlists the help of some strong British talent, all of whom play their parts fantastically. Stand out mentions go to Terry Thomas, as the creepy Dr. Longstreet with his penchant for watching nudie films on a 1920s home projector. Peter Jeffrey, as Inspector Trout, provides some of the funniest dialogue and welcome comedy relief. While Joseph Cotten puts in a convincing turn as Dr. Vesalius, grounding the piece with his dramatic acting style.

While the performances are a marvel, and the effects a joy to watch, the sets are the icing on the cake: no expensive is spared on pure art deco decadence and glamour. The Abominable Dr. Phibes is nothing short of a stylish masterpiece that exudes originality and elegance. The Phibes lair is a piste de resistance for the feature when you consider the ostentatious set design: marble floors, a giant ominous organ decorated with a slide show of a glamorous looking Caroline Munro as Victoria, gaudy colours, and Dr. Phibes clockwork band, The Clockwork Wizards, give the setting an extremely offbeat vibe unrivalled in anything else that was being made around this period.

Dr. Phibes Rises Again sees the return of Vincent Price as Dr. Anton Phibes. In order to accept anything that happens in the unfolding plot you have to, as previously mentioned, ignore some of the key factors that occur in the first film. This time Dr. Phibes is set for Egypt to resurrect his dead wife in a fountain of youth. His plans have been in the pipeline for some time, although there is no mention of this in the first Phibes venture! Phibes has an enemy, however, who may just thwart his plans, Darrus Biederbeck [Robert Quarry], who is also intent on getting his hands on immortality. Dr. Phibes is joined by his ever devoted assistant Vulnavia (this time played by Valli Kemp), traveling by ship to Egypt with Victorias embalmed corpse cleverly disguised as part of a sideshow exhibit, alongside his Clockwork Wizards. On arrival, Dr. Phibes sets up home in a grandiose pyramid that has been given an art deco interior makeover. The revenge-fuelled doctor waits for the right time to resurrect his dead lover, leaving plenty of time for killing his emissaries using some of his best tricks yet to stop them hindering his plan.

This sequel takes everything weird and wonderful about the original film and injects it with a huge dose of extra camp and this is camp on steroids. Some may lament the lack of cohesion with the first feature, however given how the film ends there is very little that could have been done without taking a huge back step and trying to rewrite history. In order to get the full enjoyment you just have to roll with the punches and not ask yourself too many questions; it is after all another opportunity to see Vincent Price giving a delectable performance as the grief stricken mass murderer. The pacing for this second film is slightly more low-key; this is due to the way the plot is delivered, as the murders are not pre-planned. However, there are some deliciously complicated deaths that showcase the gothic elegance Robert Fuest manages to, once again, envision on screen.

Performances across the board are mainly strong. Dr. Phibes this time is slightly less sinister, but this works with the developing plot. There seems to be more emphasis on the tongue-in-cheek one-liners for Price and, now, apparently able to talk, he has more dialogue in this film. Terry Thomas has a small role resurrected as an entirely different character, which may be a little confusing for some. Robert Quarry, who at the time was being prepared as a A.I.Ps rising star, gives a convincing performance as Darrus, an unlikable character that supports the notion of Dr. Phibes as the anti-hero. Peter Jeffrey returns as Trout, reviving his earlier position and injecting some dry wit into his scenes. Watch out for a very small, but nevertheless noteworthy, cameo from Peter Cushing as the Ship Captain. Vincent Price and Peter Cushing would team up in Madhouse [1974] just two years later, however, here the two do not share screen time.

Perhaps the weakest link in the casting is the replacement of Virginia North as Vulnavia with actress Valli Kemp. The original incarnation of Dr. Phibes assistant had an eerie robotic presence and something that lead fans to speculate for years over whether Vulnavia was one of Dr. Phibes clever creations. However, Kemp gives the role a slightly more human performance, hinting emotion that conflicts with the original role. Although Valli Kemp adds glamour, it could be argued that North provided the most enigmatic and mysterious carnation of the character.

Finally, Dr. Phibes features it can be said are very offbeat, dark horror comedy films that does not come as gaudily wrapped. The films stand as a testament to the statement they just don't make them like this anymore; both films revealing in eccentricity, artful direction, set design, and gothic panache. A highpoint of Vincent Prices lengthy career in the genre, the films also carry the sad resonance that Price would soon bow out from his place as reigning lead villain in horror, as he pursued other avenues, especially the stage. While the actor remained with his toe dipped in the waters of horror film for the rest of his active career, these last starring roles gave some of his most interesting and memorable characters. Now faithfully restored by Arrow Films, the films beautifully rendered in high definition, this limited edition collectors set is a must buy for all fans of the horror icon Vincent Price. Dedicated fans of Vincent Price will love the Dr. Phibes films and revel in their camp absurdity. The set is well worth a purchase if you are already a fan as it contains some great special features. Very Highly Recommended!

8642543,5,B00IJF6XZ4,"There is no doubt that this pairing has been overlooked for too long but to see the films restored to their original glory kind of makes it worthwhile. The question is, were they EVER this good?
The transfer is crisp and clean, likewise the audio. The package has the feel of having been done by people who cared. Each film is in its own cardboard gatefold and the booklet is replete with stills and memories from the likes of Caroline Munro and Tim Burton. HOWEVER, the booklet is a little too well bound and you dare not open it too far for fear of breaking the spine. It means that the print goes downhill and the two-page spread pics cannot be seen in their entirety.
The second film doesn't quite reach the dizzying art deco heights of the first but is still a lot of fun and if you buy this, you'll be putting on the second film right after the first.
So...the word of caution.
Despite having a brand new Samsung multi-region Blu-ray player, the discs will not play. Up pops a screen that says something about this player being unable to play Region B discs. Region B? What is that? I thought discs were coded numerically? Have they recoded discs so that you are unable to watch them anywhere but in the country of origin? This does not happen on any other import disc so I wonder what the heck is the deal. Maybe someone out there can answer that.
There are ways and means of watching these films without these unnecessary restrictions imposed on them but, even so, it kind of takes away the pleasure of watching them as the restorers planned.
Then again, why would you buy this import for over $140 from these bloodsuckers when you can get the same thing from Amazon UK for around $40? And then they might not even play?
This set may see the light of day in the US but, until then, these are your options: settle for the MGM Midnight Movies set or buy this vastly superior set and hope for the best.",1403481600,2,1907,4.374647887323944
