8281456,4,B001B27HHA,"As mentioned in the title, the techniques are really useful and explained in much detail. But, I don't like how they break up a single move into several techniques so that you have to watch for 10 minutes to see a complete move. I'd rather see the entire move first and then see it broken down. The translation is also pretty dry which makes learning the techniques not as entertaining as it could be.",1402876800,2,401,4.4324324324324325
8281457,5,B001B27HHA,"The techniques in these videos are awesome. they are detailed, well explained, and done at a pace so you can practice and learn while you watch. well put together and top notch. i've already tried a few moves i learned and they worked immediately and have improved my game literally overnight. Other dvd's i have show different submissions mainly, these show you how to get into position to submit, how to maintain that position even when the opponent escapes, and how to submit them. Very nice combo of techniques.",1400025600,3,515,4.797752808988764
8281458,4,B001B27HHA,"Not sure if this was suppose to be for English speakers as it's in another language and over dubbed with English. In it's defense, the translator is great and he seems to capture in great detail all the moves and action. Interestingly on Marcelo's website his English is pretty close to perfect and he doesn't miss a beat. So maybe this was before we was comfortable with it, or as I said, this may have been intended for his native country. All in all great set of instruction from a true master of the subject.",1399593600,,512,4.4
