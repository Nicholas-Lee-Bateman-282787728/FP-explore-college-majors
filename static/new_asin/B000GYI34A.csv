2620675,3,B000GYI34A,"I love the Broncos and have seen the lows ( 80's Super Bowls ) and the highs ( 90' s Super Bowls ) so I was excited about this release. Overall, it is good. The first DVD is a lot of good info and history while disc two is the Drive game in Cleveland. Yeah, a great game for sure and I love it, but I would have loved to have seen their first Super Bowl win as a complete game. I love the Broncos so I like this DVD, but it leaves one desiring a lot more knowing their rich history.",1168300800,,482,3.735294117647059
2620676,5,B000GYI34A,"Although some of the material has been released previously, the material contained here makes for a reasonably good collection.  There are some missing parts of the history but it would be difficult to include everything pertinent to the history of the Broncos and keep it under five discs.",1163635200,8,290,5.041666666666667
2620677,3,B000GYI34A,"As a lifelong Denver resident and Bronco fan, I was greatly anticipating the release of this DVD.  I was sure NFL Films would pull out some great footage that hadn't been seen before, and we could get a really in-depth look at the development of the Rocky Mountain region's first major league football franchise, as well as a game or two from the past.

If you are a die-hard Broncos fan from before the Elway era, you may be disappointed with this DVD.  While understandably focusing a great deal of attention on the man that has come to define the franchise and his impact after retirement, very little attention is given to the players that first captured the city's heart in the late 60s and early 70s, especially the Orange Crush.  Surely NFL Films could have gotten long-time defensive coordinator Joe Collier, Randy Gradishar, Rubin Carter, or Louis Wright to sit down for a few minutes and provide their thoughts on those years.  However, there is a nice section in the main feature on Marlin Briscoe, the first starting black quarterback in the AFL or NFL, as well as other lesser-known but significant players like Charley Johnson.  This historical oversight might be due to the fact that up until the mid 1970s, the Broncos just weren't a very good team and thus the archival footage of their games and players is scarce, but it is still disappointing.  Insights from Tim Mckernan, the ""Barrel Man,"" provide a nice view of a true-hardcore fan, as well as former LB Tom Jackson, who truly seems to appreciate and relish just how devoted the team's fans are.

If you are an Elway fan, you'll love this DVD.  The crux of this compilation focuses on the man's impact on the franchise and how he has come to be synonomous with the team, the city, and its identity.

The biggest disappointment has to be the single game NFL Films chose for the set, the 1987 AFC Championship game that featured ""The Drive.""  While no doubt a watershed moment in the franchise's history, as well as Elway's coming-out party, much of the actual game itself is really not all that memorable--it's only the last 5 minutes that anyone really cares about.  Rich Karlis' kick in overtime that sent them to the Super Bowl is almost an afterthought.  Why not relegate ""The Drive"" as a 20 minute special feature, and include whole games such as their first AFC Championship against Oakland in 1978 or the Super Bowl win against Green Bay, which not only ended the Broncos streak of Super Bowl losses, but the double-digit losing streak of the AFC in Super Bowls as well?  There is just so much potential that was wasted on what could have been a classic compilation.

Warning: Those who bought a VHS tape from a few years back called ""Mile High Memories"" will find a great deal of material from that tape on this DVD, including special features on Floyd Little and Tombstone Jackson.  So if you bought that tape, getting this DVD might be an unnecessary expense.

Bottom line:  Only buy if you are a die-hard Bronco fan.",1163635200,58,2998,4.656546489563567
2620678,5,B000GYI34A,"The DVD was great and I enjoyed the movie.

What I didn't appreciate was Amazons shipping services. The receipt was actually hot glued to the DVD sleeve (now ruined), there was a gash on the sleeve from a box cutter blade and the case was cracked. Luckily the DVDs were ok.",1163376000,,273,4.352941176470588
2620679,5,B000GYI34A,"Being a die hard Bronco fan since 1986 I can't wait for this DVD.

2620767,5,B000GYI34A,Great history of the Denver Broncos.  It was great learning about their history from the beginning to the present.  Elway was the man!!,1388966400,,135,4.826086956521739
2620768,4,B000GYI34A,"I know that with these ""Complete History"" sets, there are always going to be complaints about what was and was not included. However, while this was a good set, I think that there were glaring omissions. First off, I loved that they highlighted the 1960-1970s Broncos. Prior to this DVD, I had no idea about this chapter in the history other than the 1978 Super Bowl. It was good to see how it took over 15 years before the Broncos first became competitive. They spent plenty of time on all the coaches and the key players as well.

However, while the 1960s-1970s were well covered, I think that they kind of dropped the ball on the 1980s-1990s. They really did not spend too much time on the losing 1980s Super Bowl seasons. They covered ""The Drive"" & ""The Super Bowls"" but other than that, they really did not spend a whole lot of time on them. I would tend to think that there were some important games during those seasons.

Secondly, they spent almost no time on the tumultuous relationship between Elway and Dan Reeves and Elway and the fans/media. The Reeves-Elway relationship dominated the late 1980s-early 1990s and led to Reeves being fired in 1992(and replaced by Wade Phillips who they don't even mention and go right to Mike Shanahan). It was even spotlighted on the cover of Sports Illustrated.  Also, it was known that until he won the 2 Super Bowls, Elway had a love-hate relationship with the fans and media. This was not highlighted in the DVD. These events would seem like something that should at least deserve mention since they demonstrated the adversity that Elway, the most important Broncos of all-time, faced throughout his career

Lastly, the 1996 & 1998 seasons were really short-changed. The 1996 season saw the Broncos having the best record in football but getting upended by the 2nd year expansion Jacksonville Jaguars in a huge upset in the second round of the NFL playoffs. This upset was perhaps the key motivation for the 1997 Super Bowl season. I remember Elway and Shannon Sharp saying that it was the most painful loss in their careers. Yet it was not even mentioned on this DVD. As far as the 1998 season, they only fast forwarded to the Super Bowl game. They never mentioned that the Broncos had won their first 13 games and there was talk about an undefeated season before they were upset by the New York Giants in Week 15. They also never mention that, throughout the season, John Elway had hinted that this would be his final season and that the team was focused on having him ride off into the sunset as a two-time Super Bowl.

I would highly recommend this DVD, especially if you are a Broncos. However, just be aware that with all compilation sets, there are going to be things left out. Just like with a ""Greatest Hits"" CD, there is always going to be one or two songs that should've been included that were not. This set is no different.

My Rating: 1960s-1970s (5 stars): 1980s-1990s (3 stars): Whole Set (4 stars)",1382227200,2,2965,4.6273764258555135

It is a great history of the team, and provides a sense of how some of the Bronco traditions got started.
