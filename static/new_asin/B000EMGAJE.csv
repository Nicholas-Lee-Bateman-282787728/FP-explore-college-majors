8111182,4,B000EMGAJE,"Volume 1 starts on a very strange note with episode 1 with a ridiculous amount of things thrown at the viewer all at once and a situation that seems completely crazy and nonsensical.  There's a plotline about a super strong human guy, a deranged doctor with a ridiculous transforming car, and this is all before we get the explanation of why Ueki has his powers.  After the awkward-ish (though funny) first episode, things get more interesting once he learn about the characters powers, motivations, and some of the backstory about these contests.  By episode 4 I was totally hooked in the show and its absurdity.  Ueki struck me as a cool and likable ""chill"" kinda guy, a far cry from your typical hot-blooded shonen hero.  But when it comes to battle, Ueki turns up the heat and uses his righteousness to motivate and guide him in battle.  The show gets much better as it goes along but I found the beginning to be enjoyable with only episode #1 being one that I didn't enjoy rewatching.

I've watched all the 50+ episodes of the show and it's gone down as one of my favorite shonen battle animes of all time.  This is next to greats like Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter, and Yu YU Hakusho.  I just liked the characters, comedy, and powers that much.  Some of the superfluous backstory for characters that only appear once did bug me though.  If you like diverse powers, clever strategies, and absurd comedy then you'll like Ueki.",1456617600,,1429,4.608695652173913
8111183,3,B000EMGAJE,I've finally get the first DVD to watch the rest of the series so I can see how the show goes.,1388880000,,94,3.5238095238095237
8111184,4,B000EMGAJE,"Its ok, but it does show that people don't understand what makes a commander. Everyone thinks they can do a better job until they are in charge. This series is a good example of it. Good for starters in Anime.",1381017600,,209,4.25
8111185,3,B000EMGAJE,"Kousuke Ueki isn't really interesting in fighting. He's a little too nonchalant to get involved in physical violence. But he's been sucked into a tournament, with nothing less than being ""Celestial King"" on the line. In this first volume it's really not made clear exactly what powers the Celestial King has but I'm sure they're pretty substantial. And actually, it's not very important to Ueki, because whoever wants to be King doesn't fight. They pick someone to fight for them and grant them a ""Talent"" or superpower. There are 99 other candidates who have done the same and their agents must battle each other until there is only one left. The candidate who wins becomes Celestial King and the fighter gets any Talent he wishes for. Ueki gets involved in the fighting more out of a sense of duty to keep anyone evil from becoming King. He has a little help in the form of a classmate named Ai Mori, who might have romantic feelings for him. His candidate sponsor, Mr. K, who is also his teacher, seems to have little interest in becoming King, and instead is testing Ueki's ""righteousness"".

The Law of Ueki is so absurd that instead of treating it as a Shonen Jump-like show, it should be seen as more of a parody of anime of that ilk. I mean where else can you see awesome powers like the Talent to ""make trees out of trash"" or ""changing towels into iron spikes""!  It's actually pretty funny because they all have these incredibly stupid powers that at first glance wouldn't seem to have any practical value in the battles they are involved in. You must assuredly suspend disbelief to watch this show. The character designs, while a little One Piecesque, are pretty cool, and Ueki's ""why bother?"" attitude coupled with well-placed bravery make him an interesting hero. His friend Ai, with her eyeglasses perpetually propped on her head and constantly castigating Ueki is also likeable. She actually acts as a shield for him a lot because the fighters incur penalties if they harm any innocent bystanders. The animation is pretty good, but there are limits to what you can do with this type of storyline. For what it is though, Law of Ueki is above average.

I would also recommend the anime Air Master for another combination of intense fighting couple with absurd abilities.",1146960000,3,2281,4.740554156171284
8111186,5,B000EMGAJE,Ueki is a teenage boy who is given the power to turn garbage into trees by Mr. K.  This is so Ueki can enter the 'Battle of the Supernatural Powers' and win 'The Talent of Blank' and choose any talent he wishes to have.  He has to face many others who also want 'The Talent of Blank'.,1143504000,4,284,3.9649122807017543
