8039353,1,B00066NA3C,"Not the correct title for this DVD set. No way is this the San Soo of late Grand Master Woo. Watch videos on youtube on how Grand Master Woo fought. Then look at these videos. Difference is night and day. I'd would say save your money. Other masters have WAY better material on San Soo than these two DVDs. Bill Hulsey, Mark Colby, and Jack Sera. Google those guys look around before you buy.

The reason I got these DVDs cause 1. They were listed on Amazon and 2. had San Soo in the title.",1387152000,6,490,4.157894736842105
