In fact it was a place where Polish political prisoners as well as many other nationalities (including Germans) were also sent to suffer a living hell before death.  Well over a million Jews (mainly Polish Jews) died there and 150,000 Polish  Christians, among thousands of other nationalities, perished there as well.  There were over 800 excape attempts of which 141 were successful.

This documentary which features a moving song by written and sung by English songtress Katy Carr.  It also has Kay Carr interviewing the surviving escapee Kazik Piechowski, who escaped with three others (including a Polish priest and Ukrainian mechanic), disguised as SS officers, drove through the guard posts in the Commnander's car.  The escape and the massive unsuccessful SS hunt afterwards is a great and very moving story.  Kazik later became a Polish partisan and after the war was incarcerated by the Polish Communist Regime.  There is a great movie waiting to be made here.  If you have any trace of Polish blood in you, like I have, your heart will swell with pride. Roman Polanski come on down and do this thing!",1336521600,,1179,4.939086294416244
