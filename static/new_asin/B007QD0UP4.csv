5104949,5,B007QD0UP4,"Bobby Liebling, a 50-something-year-old juvenile with serious drug addictions, is the front man of an amorphous musical entity known as Pentagram. I'd never heard of them, mostly because Pentagram never actually sealed a real record deal with a major company.  They came close a couple of times, and they managed to press some underground-market vinyl, and in the 80s there were a couple of albums.  But the really big break eluded them.  That's the way this documentary presented them, as a musical entity far out on the margins of music and known as an underground band.  This is mostly due to the drug-addled, self-destructive behavior of the perpetually delinquent Liebling, and to some degree the band's lack of a cohesive identity without him. By default, for decades, ""Pentagram"" as a name has been Liebling's property as he lives in his parents' basement, weaving his dreams of rock grandeur, forming and reforming the band. And each time he verges on something good, he resorts to his own-worst-enemy ways. His primary barrier to his personal evolution was drugs: he simply can't seem to lick the problem.  At one point in the film, his arms are mummy-style bandaged from suppurating needle tracks. Horrible, really. Still, it was a fascinating record of a very real, but spavined, human being, and toward the end, it was somewhat uplifting as he finally achieves something akin to success. It fell far short of his aim but it felt like an up note. At times it was hard to watch, and it's clear that Lielbling's ship sailed a long, long time ago. In that way, his life can be seen as a grotesque manifestation of our own deeper disappointments with ourselves, and in some twisted way his story is inspiring in his belief that his ship is coming back.

I recommend this movie if you're interested in just how messed up a person can be and still somehow manage to feel that there is still some hope.  On top of that, Bobby is an immensely likable character.  I was really rooting for him, hoping he'd do this one thing right.

Overall a great documentary.  I can't think of a single thing that would have made it better.  The camera was a cool eye recording it all, and allowed us to reach our own conclusions.  I really liked this guy in the end, though I did not look up to him.  You'll probably feel the same way.

5104954,4,B007QD0UP4,"Last Days Here (Don Argott and Demian Fenton, 2011)

In the early seventies, Bobby Liebling was the lead vocalist for a band called Pentagram that you've probably never heard of. Pentagram were on the verge of stardom when, according to interview in the documentary Last Days Here, two incidentsone of them caused by Liebling, the other caused by two other band membersbasically derailed their entire career, dooming them to lives of obscurity. Fast-forward to 2004. Bobby Liebling is a meth addict living in his parents' basement in suburban Baltimore. In his late forties, Liebling looks at least thirty years older. He would probably have never been captured on film; indeed, he might well have died in obscurity were it not for Sean Pelletier, a record collector and Pentagram fan so obsessed with the band he contacted Liebling and offered to act as the band's manager if Liebling could pull together members from some of the band's classic lineups for a reunion, and as long as Liebling vowed to quit meth, as well as most of the other drugs he was using. Liebling agreed and started making calls, and Pelletier recruited Don Argott and Demian Fenton to film what Pelletier saw as Pentagram's inevitable comeback and world domination. The result is the documentary you see before you.

As they say, the best-laid plans of mice and men, etc. Saying you're going to kick drugs and actually doing it are two entirely different things (says this former smoker). Liebling has moral support from his bandmates, his manager, the filmmakers, and new girlfriend Hallie, another longtime Pentagram fan who got in touch with Liebling (old enough to be her father); the two of them begin a relationship, but if you've ever done that dance with an addict, you know how rocky it is. Indirectly, as well, Liebling has the support of thousands of Pentagram fans who are pulling for the band, some of whom are bigger than Pentagram ever were; Phil Anselmo books Pentagram to open for Down at a show in New York, for example, and there's some pre-show backstage footage of Down members telling Liebling how much his music meant to them as they were growing up, etc. Still, Liebling has a history ofto be generousflaking out. Is a comeback possible when your lead singer is a nutcase?

I've seen a lot of rock docs over the past few years, and even more per year since subscribing to Netflix again. The best of them all share certain qualities. They illuminate something that isn't entirely obscure, but has traditionally stayed out of the limelight for some reason or other. The filmmakers stay out of the way and let the subjects stand or fall on their own. Performance footage is included, but it feels natural rather than exploitative (or, worse, just there in order to attract fans of whatever it is the documentary is covering). The story itself is inherently interesting, not just to fans, but to a more general audience. Last Days Here qualifies in every regard. (I should point out, for trivia purposes if nothing else, that this was recommended to me by someone who directed another rock doc that fits, Stephen Petrus of City/Ruins: Art in the Face of Industrial Decay.) This is fine filmmaking indeed; well worth your time whether you're a longtime fan or you've never heard of them. ****",1390262400,2,3286,4.843416370106762

Why?
On the one hand it's simply shocking, but on the other hand it's a spiritual journey taking you to the meaning of life.

If you will check later where Bobby is today, you will see that all is real. No Fake.
The documentary was filmed over 6 years and the film makers have been at the right time at the right place. Thank you.

Tip: If you have seen the documentary and want to see Bobby performing, check out the great DVD: ""When The Screams Come"".

Arena concerts, traveling tours, platinum albums -- those of us who grew up in the decade witnessed a glorious time when house lights go dark and the band walked onto the stage. Is there a more electric moment? Cameron Crowe's terrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Almost-Famous/dp/B009NX88JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Almost Famous</a>&nbsp;comes closest to recreating the era, a time when Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, KISS and Thin Lizzy tours were spectacular migratory festivals stopping in town. Rock was religion, arenas the church, and coolness was defined by what band's t-shirt you wore.

""Last Days Here"" details Sean Pelletier, a passionate music collector who comes across a Pentagram&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Daze-Here/dp/B00005UO69/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Daze Here</a>&nbsp;LP at a dusty record store. Personally, I had never heard of the band until this documentary. They were a doom metal act formed in Virginia around 1974, sporting bell-bottoms, long hair and a sound inspired by early&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Sabbath/dp/B000002KB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Sabbath</a>. Pelletier thinks it's the greatest album he's ever heard, and I must admit the song ""Forever My Queen"" freakin' rocks. He becomes obsessed and tries to track down members, who would be in their 60s by now. Amazingly, he finds lead singer Bobby Liebling, a weathered misfit with all the charisma of a homeless bag lady. He's living in the basement of his parent's home near Philadelphia, a hopeless, unemployed drug addict.

The scenes of Liebling, crawling across the floor looking for crack cocaine, chain smoking and often-times babbling incoherently, are disturbing. He's a trapped relic, and his days are numbered. We learn the history of Pentagram, and it appears they almost hit it big. They auditioned for Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alive/dp/B000001EL1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alive!</a>) and even recorded several songs with Blue Oyster Cult's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Oyster-Cult/dp/B0012GMWFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Oyster Cult</a>) producer. But fate was unkind, and Liebling had a tendency to sabotage opportunities. His drug addictions led to the band's demise, and we hear past members state emphatically they will never work with the singer again. We see past footage of attempted Pentagram reunions, with Liebling stumbling on stage in a repulsive heroin-induced stupor.

Today, this one-time lithe, formidable Ozzy echo is a shell of a man, with Gandalf-gray hair living in secluded delusion. Perhaps it was good fortune Jim Morrison died young (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riders-on-the-Storm-My-Life-with-Jim-Morrison-and-the-Doors/dp/0385304471/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and the Doors</a>), because he could have very well ended up like Liebling. Pelletier wants to form an intervention, allowing the singer to become drug-free and possibly tour. It's ambitious to say the least, and as the documentary progresses there's apparently a cult market for Pentagram. But Liebling's self-destruction appears too much to overcome.

""Last Days Here"" was directed by Don Argott and Demian Fenton, who gave us the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-School/dp/B000A5043I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock School</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-the-Steal/dp/B003JHXS1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of the Steal</a>. They filmed quite a bit of early footage, but abandoned the project because they were not sure Liebling could overcome his demons. It's a massive struggle, as Liebling's addictive personality carries over into a relationship with a new girlfriend. They break up, he stalks her and is jailed for defying a restraining order. Pelletier becomes close friends with Liebling, though confesses it has become a full-time job jeopardizing his life and career.

For anyone who has been involved with a drug addict or alcoholic, scenes from ""Last Days Here"" will be instantly identifiable. It is deceptively easy to fall into ""enabler"" mode and yet, allowing a person to die preys upon the mind. There is no easy solution for helping someone as far gone as Liebling -- or any drug addict for that matter. Sober or not, they carry demons and will be possessed for the rest of their lives. Pelletier's troubled loyalty to Liebling is equally fascinating, and as they sluggishly march towards their goal of a Pentagram reunion concert in New York, you want them to succeed. When the house lights go dark and the band walks onto the stage, I defy anyone not to shed a tear.

I loved ""Last Days Here,"" a sort of dark, true-life version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap/dp/B002CMXAYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap</a>. Sobriety can be fleeting, and one suspects Liebling has a long way to go. But he made the most difficult first step, and the crowd roared.",1370822400,12,5465,6.531034482758621
5104961,5,B007QD0UP4,The cover makes this look like it would appeal only to hardcore fans of thrash death metal but that is not what it's all about. The music is more along the lines of Black Sabbath and the story here is very interesting and the constant twists keep you interested until the very end. One of the best rock music related documentaries I've seen and I've watched a lot of them.,1369526400,3,372,4.328571428571428
5104962,5,B007QD0UP4,I never heard of Pentagram growing up. I read about this movie and it sounded right up my alley. My favorite rockumentary is the Anvil one. I thought this sounded kind of similar so I checked it out. All I can say is that I have a new favorite! It is hard to write a review of this without giving anything away. This is the most inspirational film I have ever seen. If you are feeling down on life watch this movie. It will give you a whole new perspective on life and what a gift it is. Hollywood cannot write a story this good. Spread the word about this movie if you see it. This is a must see. I rarely write reviews of movies but this one is as good as it gets.!,1369440000,5,667,3.948148148148148

5104965,5,B007QD0UP4,"""Last Days Here"" shows the seemingly-hopeless life of a hardcore drug addict through the life of doom metal legend Bobby Liebling of Pentagram.  Being a massive fan of Pentagram, I had heard about Bobby Liebling's troubles and I knew that the band had been through a lot of members, but this movie REALLY opened my eyes.  It was heartbreaking to see him looking so gaunt, disheveled, and, frankly, like a homeless person who happened to be crashed in someone's basement.  This was Bobby Liebling, the singer of one of my favorite doom metal bands!

God, Satan, Krishna, or whomever, bless ""Pellet"" for befriending Bobby and sticking with him through so much in order to help him get his soul back.  When Pentagram actually finally takes the stage, it is like a revival!

The real story here is not about one of the greatest doom metal bands ever, drug addiction, or a band that failed to make it big.  In the end, this is a story about a man who is in pain and desperately needs someone to love him.  The loneliness he must have felt in the ""sub-basement"" for decades is unimaginable.

I cannot recommend this movie highly enough for anyone who loves Pentagram.

FIVE STARS!

Liebling seems pitifully stuck in some kind of self-inflicted purgatory either awaiting death, or awaiting a miracle.

The film centers around longtime fan Sean Pelletier who acts as Liebling's friend and manager. Pelletier hopes to single-handedly rehabilitate Liebling and milk him for all he's worth in turning out another Pentagram album. Much like a spoiled child, Pelletier gets easily annoyed whenever things don't go according to plan as if he believes Liebling is some kind of easygoing pet frog. In the midst of the Pentagram project, Pelletier, like a frustrated teenager admits his hatred (albeit misconstrued hatred) for Liebling's girlfriend when troubles between them bring things to a bit of a standstill.

The film's highlights are Liebling's candid confessions and seeing him get back on track and in gear to produce new Pentagram material. It's a pretty entertaining film, but I find fault with the fact that it isn't well-focused. The filmmaker fails to supply a clear background view of both Bobby Liebling and Pentagram. Parts of the documentary are a bit sluggish and too much footage is unfortunately wasted on trivialities. Instead, the filmmaker could have contributed more information for a better understanding of Pentagram's history.

If you're a big fan of Pentagram, you probably won't find much fault with this film. It's an above-average effort and a welcome addition to the rock documentary genre. (3.5 stars)",1446508800,,1626,5.444444444444445
