6268242,3,B00IK5JIQE,"Overall I feel this doc had a lot of promise - and indeed the opening 10 minutes which briefly focus on the rise of the VCR is very interesting and drew me in - but ultimately it lost me with the shoddy structure and lack of focus. They touch quickly on how people desire the product of certain labels, this is certainly an area that could have been mined for greater content... discussing the difference between labels, discussing the promotional means by which they attempted to draw customers.... I guess I was looking for less blurry shots of quickly-scanned shots of collector's shelves, and more genuine content about the product itself, and how it's desirous nature compels some to collect.
The other thing I need to mention is the quality of the documentary. I appreciate the effect they were going for (making it look like it was shot on a shoddy VHS-camcorder) but, man, that really overstays it's welcome very quickly. That particular stylistic choice would have been much more effective had it been limited to, say, the opening and the closing of the doc.
Overall it's good for a watch - wish I could have rented it rather than buying it, but of course (as the doc rightly points out) that kind of option is quickly dwindling!",1408060800,5,1238,4.68348623853211
6268243,2,B00IK5JIQE,"I feel bad giving it 2 stars but thats being generous. This movie almost makes me feel like a looser for being a collector. The ppl interviewed are really creepy, low rent ppl. I felt like I needed a shower after watching this. From beginning to end its a mess, its all over the place. Where did you find these collectors, its a bunch of 40 yr old male nerds that have no life aside of living in moms basement collecting movies. Its just a very weird watch. I totally loved Rewind This film about VHS. Its a much more in-depth look into VHS and collecting. I found AYT very boring, its just a bunch of weird ppl showing their collection. If you want to see ppls VHS collections you can that on youtube for free. This was totally misleading. The only interesting part was interviewing actual video store owners in their stores. They had a real story to tell. But that was only about 10 mins long, then its back to the annoying collectors in there basements. Very strange, very disappointed,  and very not worth the money....",1404777600,9,1023,4.441489361702128
6268244,5,B00IK5JIQE,"I grew up in the 90s, the peak of the video boom, right before the massive fall of the video store and vhs as the king of the formats. I had a local mom & pop shop (movies to go) in my little town and eventually we got a Blockbuster, a Hollywood Video, and a few other video stores that popped up and came tumbling down just as quickly. I have nostalgia for that time in my life. I used to rent old movies, 6 for $6 and my summers were filled with roundhouse kicks and monsters. Of course I cant deny how much I have loved using Netflix either. I was an early adopter of Netflix after having rented everything of interest from my local stores. I wish for a world where both can co-exist but as of right now we know that isn't happening. I also love finding funky VHS tapes at thrift stores and cruise my local spots regularly hoping to find some grimy gold. Adjust Your Tracking is a documentary about doing just that, digging deep and trying to find forgotten films and preserve them for future enjoyment. It is also about the love of video stores and the love of our cinematic childhoods.

You may be thinking, wait, wasn't there another VHS documentary? Yes, there was. Filmed at the same time by separate filmmakers, Rewind This was also about the love VHS but focused more on its impact on filmmakers and took a much more historical look at the format. Adjust Your Tracking interviews some of the same folks that were featured in Rewind This but has a different focus. The focus here is really on the culture of collecting and why people love filling up their homes with plastic magnetic jewels. This film interviews some of the heavy hitters of the collecting world as well as VHS banner wavers like the guys behind Massacre Video and Lunchmeat magazine (whom I write for and highly recommend!). Its a fun doc thats well paced and informative without ever being dull. Running at a lean 80 minutes it doesnt overstay its welcome and kept me engaged throughout. I love the subject and I love documentaries and this one is a sure fire winner. I really liked Rewind This but I felt it was lacking VHS current history and culture and Adjust Your Tracking fills that void very nicely. This is the debut film from the director and if this is where he is starting, I cant wait to see where he goes next. It seems easy to go out and a shoot a doc but trust me, it isnt. I know he drove across the entire U.S. doing tons of interviews, probably shooting hundreds of hours of interviews to cut that down into an 80 minute feature that has an organic and seemingly effortless flow is one tough feat, especially when you're working on a small budget, and with little experience. Adjust Your Tracking isn't good for a first feature, its just plain good. I really enjoyed watching it and Im really glad I did.

Also included on the dvd are 3 short films which I also really enjoyed. One is about a video store trying to hang on, another is about Chester Turner the man behind the cult phenomenon Tales of the Quadead Zone, and another is about a huge video store in Staten Island that has to close. They all add to the overall flavor of the culture of VHS and the one about the small video store hanging on has inspired me to go to my own local video store (its 30 min away) and rent a few things with my kids. There are in total 7+ hours of bonus features for us to dig into and that my friends is value for money indeed!

Its clear that Adjust Your Tracking is a labor of love. The film needed to be made and was executed by the right team at the right time. Theyve produced an important documentary well worth the sticker price for any body who used to roam around a video store looking for gold and anyone who continues to hunt for hidden cult treasure. Recommended!",1402617600,8,3761,4.339488636363637
6268245,4,B00IK5JIQE,"I supported the making of this movie from day one when its online campaign to raise funds began.  When I got my early reward copy I was very excited.  While I do not consider myself on the same level as the hardcore collectors featured in this film, I do appreciate the life style and always enjoy learning more about anything related to the movie geek way. As such, I went in to this viewing very much wanting to like this film.  And I did.  But I just ""liked"" it, not love.

  Now, while I am in no way a film maker, I feel this this documentary failed to tell a straight story.  It started out well, telling the story of how video mom and pop video stores sprang up all over the country in the late 70s and 80s.  However, after that it starts to go off the tracks.  Rather than focusing on telling a story with a start middle and end, it seems to go all over, switching from a collector showing off his prize tapes to a video store owner taking about how his store will soon be closing.  In my humble opinion, I think they should have focused on a core group of video stores and told their story of glory days to current sad closing. I think the film-makers should have saved all of the big time VHS collectors interviews for the last part of the documentary. Also, missed opportunities to discuss VHS box and poster artwork, the most hard to find titles, and the large part big box stores played in taking down many many locally owned video stores are either glazed over or lost altogether.

  Adjust Your Tracking is a good and interesting film.  It can just be frustrating at times when you watch it and see what could have been.  The film makers didn't really  present a wide range of VHS collectors in the sense that they only showed them as white male tattooed film geek stereotypes. I would have liked to see more with the Ma and Paws who owned those video stores, rather than another sweeping shot of many VHS filled book shelves in a collector's apartment and or basement at his mom's house.

  I still say buy this film and watch it.  Here's hoping that it will give many a little insight into why some dedicated few would choose to keep this film format alive and well.  However, I fear that this movie will only help to win over the converted rather than help bring more into the fold. Consider this a jumping off point into a fun new world of obscure film, rather than a definite final word on this subject.",1399852800,18,2423,4.314159292035399
8642882,5,B00IK5JIQE,"The official follow up to Rewind This and definitely more focused on the fans of collecting and searching dusty old middle of nowhere shops for some forgotten gems.  What, really, someone bought a vhs tape for $700???  Tales from the Quadead Zone?  Sounds like a z-grade basement production.  It's getting harder to find VHS tapes out in the wild, all the places that might have them are closing down.  I can't stand buying movies online anymore, it just ruins the fun.  And when I bring home a broken vhs tape there's nothing more exciting than learning how to fix it, but mold on the other hand is a deal breaker.  The film cleaner that's needed to sterilize and kill mold is no longer made.  I'm starting to tip the scales, reducing my DVD collection and returning mostly to VHS, movies have always looked better on film to me and always will.",1528761600,,846,4.556291390728477
8642883,1,B00IK5JIQE,"Way too much on horror movies. I'm an active VHS fan, with lots of tapes. I've got LOTS of tapes - both pre-recorded and blank tapes where I have
built my own library. But to listen to this video...there were just horror (and X-rated) What about all the people who bought mainstream...and family...
and recorded their own stuff for the future. I'm disappointed !",1519862400,,362,4.671875
8642884,4,B00IK5JIQE,I love this documentary!  There are few out right now covering the popular 'demise' of the format and the closing of mom and pop shops across the country.  This one digs into the heart of why some fans decided to collect VHS and how a culture has popped up surrounding it.  There are some of the same people interviewed from other documentaries on the subject but this one lets the camera roll a bit more.  The packaging and editing on the material is top notch.  I can't wait to see what this team comes up with next!,1465776000,,518,4.298969072164948

8642887,5,B00IK5JIQE,"I didn't know what to expect, but you don't have to know about or care about VHS to enjoy this film.  The focus is on the collectors themselves and the interviews are fun and the people are interesting and overall a very entertaining documentary!  Well done.",1429401600,2,258,4.586956521739131
8642888,4,B00IK5JIQE,"'Adjust Your Tracking' is a 2-disc set documenting the crazy world of VHS tape collecting. Disc 1 contains the main feature along with a plethora of special features including these short films: 'Video Shelf'(11:22), 'It Wasn't In Vain, It Was In Staten Island'(6:34), and 'The Balled of Chester Novell(7:15). I really enjoyed the 'Video Shelf' and 'Staten Island' short films about the final moments of a couple of small/independent video rental stores. It was kind of sad to watch but I could feel the history and energy of these places when it was still vibrant.

There are two separate commentary tracks. One with directors Dan Kinem and Levi Peretic. The other with producers Matt Desiderio and Josh Schafer. Directors Dan and Levi were energetic and full of fun stories but they had this annoying habit of repeating the word ""like"" about a million times(or roughly every fourth word). Disc 2 contains more special features. These include 'Deleted Scenes': Cutboxes(2:20), Everything is Terrible(4:17), Faces of Death(6:44), Redbox(2:52), Scarecrow Video(6:07), and Shot on Video(4:10). As well as 'Behind the Scenes': Foggy Mountain Breakdown(9:10), Alamo Drafthouse Q&A(3:27), and Back Alley Film Series Q&A(4:57).

And lastly on disc 2 are the Extended Interviews(2:13:56) with folks such 42nd St. Pete, Lloyd Kaufman, and a number of the collectors from the film. Didn't care too much for 42nd St. Pete but it was fun hearing more from the VHS fanatics. Overall I found this documentary very enjoyable to watch and I loved the passion of these collectors(no matter how crazy they are). The only thing is that I wished there was more material on those small independent shop owners that went out of business. I find their stories to be fascinating and wanted to learn more about them. And personally I could have done without the producers commentary. Those two in my opinion were lethargic and didn't have all that many interesting things to say.",1428192000,7,1955,5.12539184952978

8642891,5,B00IK5JIQE,"This is a good documentary over the rise & fall of VHS & the people that collect VHS tapes. The one person that got me interested in the genres, Paul Zamarelli, is featured very briefly in this movie. If you enjoy this film and horror films then I recommend checking this guy out on You Tube but I digress. Most collectors are nice people & some of them look like social awkward misfits but I won't be cruel like another reviewer to say they live in there parents basement. The movie moves at a brisk pace & is rather short. I watched the special features, something I rarely do, & highly enjoyed it. Very fun look at the world of VHS collecting & highly recommend if you like horror movies because this is what most of them collect. I hope they do a sequel to this film.",1423267200,2,771,4.2517006802721085
