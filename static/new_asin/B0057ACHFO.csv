I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL!! GREAT JOB TO THE DAMIANS FOR WRITING AND DIRECTING SUCH A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE YOUNG AND OLD :)",1313452800,3,281,3.9473684210526314
4594568,1,B0057ACHFO,Stupid!  Not one bit like the original movie and shouldn't be associated with it at all.  What a waste of money renting this foolishness.,1473465600,,137,4.666666666666667

4594572,1,B0057ACHFO,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1188,4.8088235294117645

4594581,4,B0057ACHFO,"I have two girls under 9. They love the ""Buddy"" movies, and wanted to watch ""Marley and Me"", but it would have left them heartbroken. This is the perfect blend; the antics of Marley without the sadness of the loss of a beloved pet. Kept my girls entertained through several viewings!",1451606400,2,283,4.568627450980392

4594623,2,B0057ACHFO,"""The Puppy Years"" is too foolish.  Not only would an adult be turned off by the formula-driven aspect and over-acting, but I wouldn't expect a five-year-old child to be happy with it either.  Was this film truly terrible?  It is as close to a single-star as one can get.

On the other hand, I do recommend the original ""Marley & Me"" film.  That film was tender, sweet, and also executed by professionals (on-screen and off).",1405728000,,424,4.6
4594624,5,B0057ACHFO,This has become one of my 3 year old granddaughters favorite movies. So cute.,1405555200,,77,4.571428571428571

4594636,2,B0057ACHFO,"What can I say?  YUCK!  Not nearly as cute and funny as the first Marley & Me.  Save your money, don't even bother renting it!  I usually LOVE dog movies, but this was not at all what I expected.",1400112000,3,195,3.923076923076923
4594637,4,B0057ACHFO,The movie has a nice storyline. It is a bit boring at times for kids over the age of 12.,1398297600,,88,3.45
4594638,2,B0057ACHFO,"I liked the first movie much better.  It was much more interesting and emotionally engaging becuse you could see it was based on a real family with real feamily problems and dynamics.  Even if the movie would have been based on a FAKE, MAKE BELIEVE FAMILY, the writing for the first movie was much better.",1396569600,4,305,4.527272727272727
4594639,1,B0057ACHFO,"I loved Marley & Me.  You can't even compare the two.  Bad plot and acting.  Very disappointing.  Would not recommend anybody wasting time or money on this, especially if you are expecting the same caliper as Marley & Me.",1396224000,3,221,4.589743589743589
4594640,1,B0057ACHFO,This movie is not for people over the age of 4. Please do not waist your money. Yawn yawn yawn,1394928000,,94,3.75

4594642,5,B0057ACHFO,I don't get this but my children (who are petrified of dogs) just love this movie.  It is very wholesome while still keeping their interest.,1391817600,,140,4.6
4594643,5,B0057ACHFO,I bought this movie for the kids I babysit for and it keeps them entertained during the week.  They love it so I love it,1391212800,,120,3.8
4594644,5,B0057ACHFO,"the dog talks in this film so if you want to see the book come to life, I would pass on this movie and find the movie without ""the puppy years"". Other wise it is a cute movie.",1382745600,,175,3.6315789473684212
4594645,3,B0057ACHFO,"While it's nothing like the original, kids will enjoy it.  Not to hard for an adult to sit through which is how I rate kids movies since we are the one's that watch with them.",1380672000,,175,4.0

4594647,1,B0057ACHFO,"This movie has got to be the most aggravating, terrible movie I have ever seen. The plot is sudden, and predictable. This movie will not bring any joy to a family, or to anyone at all.",1373155200,,184,4.138888888888889
4594648,5,B0057ACHFO,"My son (8 yrs) loves this movie. It is cute and funny. I really like it, too. It is very well made for this type of film and the story is interesting. The large variety of dogs in it will satisfy lovers of many breeds. Min pins, aussies, and labs figure prominently as does a cat. The lead actor is Lucas Cruikshank from the Fred series that many kids love.",1371513600,,357,4.114285714285714
4594649,1,B0057ACHFO,"Showed it to my little after school class (age 4-9), it was awful. I fell asleep and they kept asking when it would be over. Terrible movie. Stick with Disney.",1369353600,,159,4.333333333333333
4594650,5,B0057ACHFO,I was able to watch this with my grandchildren and not worry about language.  It was a very positive movie.  Puppies voices were cute.  Good wins over evil.,1367539200,,156,4.5
4594651,2,B0057ACHFO,"This was a good childs movie.  I have become used to the price of videos delivered to me from Amazon being the least expensive possible.  So I didn't do any comparative shopping. By this method the movie was way over priced.  I went to Walmart the next day and found a copy of this in a duel pack with the Marley and Me, and purchased both movies for $9.99.  This was my first purchase from Amazon Cloud.  If that is the value I am going to get, I'm not sure if there is another one in the near future. If I would have done my homework I would have realized the price of $21.99 at least twice what it should have been.  If I do buy any more movies from the amazon, I will do more price shopping first.",1361750400,,701,4.0071942446043165

4594653,4,B0057ACHFO,Enjoyed watching it with my kids! I expected a movie similar to the first one (minus the death) but it is for a much younger group.,1357344000,,131,4.076923076923077
4594654,4,B0057ACHFO,The item was shipped and received on time with no damage.  This dvd is a christmas present for my daughter.,1355443200,,107,4.35
4594655,3,B0057ACHFO,This is a nice PG family film. Anything with dogs that is done well is good entertainment.  Nice to watch with our Grandchildren.,1336348800,,129,4.608695652173913
4594676,3,B0057ACHFO,"Marley & Me was great----a real heart-tugger for dog lovers.  A testimony of faithfulness and commitment to the canine critter you brought into your family.  ""The Puppy Years"" was fun and light w/o tugging at your heart.",1334966400,2,220,4.918918918918919
4594677,5,B0057ACHFO,Another one of my 2 year old granddaughters favorites and she watches it all the time...we were very pleased with the quality of the movie for the price we paid for it!,1333411200,,168,4.28125
4594678,1,B0057ACHFO,The wrong disk was in the right cover. I sent it to my grand daughter so I couldn't send it back.,1331510400,,97,3.6666666666666665
4594679,3,B0057ACHFO,"This is definitely a kid-oriented movie and on that level, it succeeds as a cute enjoyable film.  Adults might find it too contrived and difficult to appreciate.
THE PUPPY YEARS is obviously an attempt to cash in on its successful origins but is so amateurishly done, there is no real comparison.  First problem is the decision to have the animals talk.  It's become a tired device and the voice characterizations aren't particularly effective.  The human actors tend to overact and poor Donnelly Rhodes (DaVinci's Inquest) is forced to act as second banana to the dogs.
But I'm being too Scroogish...family films are intended to entertain families looking for wholesome entertainment.  This movie should meet that criteria just fine.",1327017600,4,734,5.186440677966102
4594680,5,B0057ACHFO,I will buy more products from Amazon.  It is very prompt and there are no problems with the products that I have ordered such as Marley & Me 2 The Puppy Years DVD.  I was pleased to have this DVD mailed promptly and came in the condition that was written with the price and product on Amazon.  Thanks for the prompt delivery.

4594682,1,B0057ACHFO,"Marley & Me was great, although sad and probably inappropriate for some children.  But this is just a sad and poor excuse to gain dollars from those who loved the original book and/or film or those families who like the ""buddy"" films.  Why make the dog talk?  And what age was the ""lead"" Bodi supposed to be?  The script, the premise and everything about this film was clearly rushed so that ""they"" could make profit on it.  Rent a Buddy movie or something else but SKIP this!!!!!  And whatever you do...don't BUY it!!1!",1322179200,6,520,4.537634408602151
4594683,2,B0057ACHFO,"I was duped into renting this movie. I thought it would be somewhat similar to the original Marley & Me, but it wasn't. This movie is very similar to the Air Buddies series.
