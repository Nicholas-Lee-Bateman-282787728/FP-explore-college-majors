7825985,5,6302465044,I always loved steven seagal and will always love his features.  People don't understand that 8 blackbelts isn't an easy feat.  I love his realism but have a lukeworm reception to his method acting.  I recomend this DVD to everyone who likes Aikido and Mr. Steven,1093651200,3,263,4.673913043478261
7825986,4,6302465044,"First, Above the law is seagals first and there he is young and delivers some good aikido action as well as his typical acting.
Hard to kill is a fun flick with excellent choreagraphy by seagal himself. He almost dies but wakes up and retrains his martial arts skills to get revenge. His former hot wife Kelly Lee Brock starrs as the nurse who helps him.
Out for justice is a more violent version of above the law, where seagal walks around beating up people while hunting the bad guy.
In all a good collection for those who like Aikido action.",1050883200,3,544,4.396039603960396
