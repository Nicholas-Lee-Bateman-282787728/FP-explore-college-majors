8533631,5,B009136ZYW,"Fans of the zany series of 'road to' films that took Bing Crosby & Bob Hope to Singapore, Zanzibar, Morocco, Utopia, Rio, Bali, and Hong Kong between 1940 and 1962 rejoice. This wonderful DVD compilation of rare film & TV excerpts, along with complete film shorts and theatrical trailers is skillfully edited together to feature film length. Yes, ""On The Road With Bing & Bob"" could almost be called the lost 8th road picture!

Details of the contents of this compilation are well represented in the Amazon listing for this DVD, so I won't repeat them here, but would like to point out a few of the choice gems on this disc:

THE ROAD TO HOME is a special one reel short subject Hope & Crosby filmed in 1945 (each sporting Navy uniforms) for the purpose of advising sailors not to leave the service prematurely. It is cleverly interspersed with clips from the first 3 'roads' and the forthcoming 4th Road To Utopia (filmed in late 1943 / early 1944 but not released until 1946).

COMMAND PERFORMANCE is another one reel short subject that is a real time capsule. A 10 minute condensed version of a 30 minute AFRS Command Performance radio broadcast from 1944. Yes a film of an actual radio broadcast! Bob Hope is the master of ceremonies, introduced by the melifluous voice of Ken Carpenter. Crosby does not appear in this (he was overseas entertaining the troops, while Hope was stateside!) but there are several choice barbs from Hope in his monologue that mention him.

THE FIFTH FREEDOM, a one reel gem in color from 1951, is all about promoting freedom of choice, while not too subtly promoting Chesterfield cigarettes with the aid of the big name stars they were currently sponsoring on radio & TV (Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Arthur Godfrey and Perry Como). Look for a rumpled, unshaven Hope and Crosby in what has to be the gaudiest outfit he ever wore in a film! Como sings ""Bless This House"", and Crosby offers a chorus of ""You're A Grand Old Flag"" looking like a barker at a fair.

YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD is another 1951 promotional piece from Father Keller for the Christopher's Movement, featuring Bing crooning a song he had recently waxed for Decca ""Early American"", with Jack Benny, Rochester, Hope, et al all in featured parts.

There's a choice excerpt from the March 1955 TV broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony for films of 1954. Bing joins Hope in white tie and tails to trade zingers, with references to Hope's current film ""The Seven Little Foys"", and Bing's film for which he was nominated that year for best actor, ""The Country Girl"".

In addition to excerpts from a color golf short featuring Bing & Bob (Bing croons ""Tomorrow's My Lucky Day"", a song he would later record in 1957), there's Bing & Frank Sinatra singing a medley from the Edsel TV launch in October of 1957, featuring a surprise cameo and song from Hope. The DVD closes with a 'solo' road, Bing on the Road To Peace with Ann Blyth, his co-star in the 1949 Paramount feature film TOP 'O THE MORNING. Together, Bing & Ann reprise one of the songs from ""TOP"" for this short.

All in all, an amazing package of some very rare, seldom seen Hope & Crosby film excerpts. A must for those who can't get enough of these two world travelers. A highly recommended companion to those classic feature films.",1348963200,,3287,4.626072041166381
