I am in my late 30's, so I was around 8 or so when the Incredible Hulk first came to television back in the late 70's/early 80's. I have some memories of a few of the episodes and watching them again after all this time is pretty cool. :-) Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno did a great job on the show. Too bad that the execs at CBS thought the show was too expensive - it could have gone on for a few more good years.
If you remember the Hulk from when you were a kid or want to show your kids how good television used to be, grab a copy of the Hulk. You won't be disappointed.",1215216000,6,588,3.8278688524590163
3153801,5,B001675Z2E,"Bought this as a birthday present for my 31 year old son - just what he wanted. Of course, you need to know the child likes Tom Jones, too. :)",1214524800,2,142,3.7666666666666666
3153802,4,B001675Z2E,"The Third Season of The Incredible Hulk in many ways betters Seasons One and Two. The stories here are overall more exciting than in the Second Season and there are fewer lulls. You also get more insight into David Banner and (very pleasingly) Jack McGee. But there's one thing I did miss here; Two-parters. Season Two had the knockout episodes ""Married"" and
""Mystery Man"" which were stretched to feature length. Here the episode ""Homecoming"" could easily have been a two-parter. David finds his way back home and makes up with his sister and father, whom he had always blamed for the death of his mother. It's a great episode which only fault is that it's too short.

Some great highlights here include ""The Snare"" and ""The Psychic"" which are two outstanding episodes. ""The Snare"" lifts it's plot from the short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" which has been filmed several times. A recluse hunter on a remote island invites David to spend the night and before you know it David is fighting for his life for the hunter has become bored with hunting animals. ""The Psychic"" is very emotional with some incredibly sad overtones. Bixby's former wife Brenda Benet plays the psychic, who can see what David becomes and she also forsees Jack McGee's imminent death. Those who know something about Bixby's life will know that Benet committed suicide excactly one year after the death of their son Christopher. ""The Psychic"" aired shortly after Benet and Bixby had gone through a tough divorce. Both give exceptional performances here.

Some episodes which are considered lulls I actually found very entertaining. ""Blind Rage"" was a thrilling episode where David becomes blind, ""The Slam"" was an entertaining episode where David gets arrested and sent to a work camp. That episode also stars Robert Davi and Charles Napier. Softer episodes such as ""Long Road Home"" and ""Falling Angels"", which are considered not good, well I found them very entertaining.

""Broken Image"", ""Death Mask"" and ""Equinox"" are also outstanding episodes. ""Broken Image"" is the one where Banner and McGee meet face to face, ""Death Mask"" is where Banner is suspected of multiple murders and ""Equinox"" is the one where McGee corners Banner in a costume party. They're all great. It's also great to see a whole episode devoted entirely to Jack McGee in ""Proof Positive"" and the late Jack Colvin excels there, as always.

The guest stars in the Third Season are much better than in the previous two seasons. There's much more consistency in the acting department here with supporting actors and that's one of the things that particularly plagued the Second Season. Bradford Dillman was a great villain in ""The Snare"", Paul Koslo is especially appealing in ""The Long Road Home"", Robert Hogan is marvellous as the scam artist in the mediocre episode ""The Lottery"", Brenda Benet is superb in ""The Psychic"", Gerald McRaney is very good and creepy in ""Death Mask"", Marc Alaimo showed some strong acting in ""Nine Hours"" and John Marley was fantastic is Banner's father in ""Homecoming"". An episode always goes down better with good performances from it's guest stars and there's no shortage of that here.

Not many episodes were dull but if I had to name someone I'd go with ""Babalao"" and ""Sideshow"". Those were below average.

Overall, this is a strong season of The Incredible Hulk. Bill Bixby doesn't falter once as David Banner, Jack Colvin is excellent as Jack McGee and Lou Ferrigno is up to the task again.",1214438400,12,3468,4.929794520547945
3153803,4,B001675Z2E,"For the record , I am not saying this season sucks, because it didn't, but what I am saying is it doesn't hold up as seasons one two or four. My first critisism is that the season opener and finale were by far some of the dumbest episodes ever , I know that most everybody hates the episode Babalou or however it is spelled , but for now I cannot comment on this it has been a long time since I have seen that one. the other thing is since they really didn't have the hulk wearing his torn shirts anymore which is what I liked as a kid (which it looked like they tried to bring that back on what was the few of season five), they started doing the torn pants which was kinda better ,but it made seasons one and two look ironic,on why it took season three for them to come up with that . plus they seen they couldn't make up there minds on if they were going to do it on all episodes. however the show was not in vain as it did have some great episodes my favorite being ""deathmask"". I always liked seeing films where serial killers who prey on women get whats coming  to them. I would have also wanted them to have made a sequel to ""homecoming"" on later episodes or seasons. And how his family coped with his problem. But this season as well as the whole series is worth purchasing they quality of the pictures are restored very well, but I wonder why Universal could restor all the hulk episode, but stopped on later season releases of ""Emergency""?",1212883200,2,1449,4.175
3153804,3,B001675Z2E,"After the hugely successful 78-79 season, The Incredible Hulk returned to CBS in the fall of '79 looking to duplicate its success of the previous year. However, the strong points of season two unfortunately were the weak points of season three. While the season is marked with some of the series' best episodes, several of the worst episodes can also be found in the mix. Where season two usually has Banner's life being threatened about once every couple months, seaosn three has Banner finding himself in the season one predicaments (getting tied up, beaten up) more often than not. Throw in some below average storylines and as a whole, season three winds up pretty uneven, but still definately worth a look.

First the average: ""Metamorphosis"" (with the exception of the abbreviated season five) is easily the weakest opener of the series, with guest star Mackenzie Phillips' problems in the episode overshadowing her real life demons. Human interest stories such as ""Jake"", ""Falling Angels"", ""Sideshow"", and ""My Favorite Magician"" (which reunites Bill Bixby and Ray Walston from their ""My Favorite Martian"" days) are feeble attempts to rekindle the magic of season two in which David comes to the aid of the guest star of the week. In saying this, ""Magician"" is worth a look if only to see Bixby and Walston for one last time.  Episodes such as ""Long Run Home"", and ""The Lottery"" are not horrendous, but more or less represent the middle of a mediocre season that at times, seemed to struggle in the creativity department.

The embarassing: Episodes such as ""Babalao"", and the season finale ""On the Line"", are downright atrocious and should pretty much be skipped altogether.

Now to the good: ""The Slam"" is probably one of the most underrated Hulk episodes that season three has to offer. I won't give things away, but you can't keep The Hulk caged for too long!  In ""Homecoming"", David returns home to his sister and estranged father. An emotional rollercoaster from start to finish, ""Homecoming"" is arguably the best episode of season three and definately one of the highlights of the entire series. This episode CANNOT be missed.  While not as powerful as ""Homecoming"", ""The Snare"" finds David in a fight for his life as a derranged hunter who witnesses Banner's transformation into the Hulk resorts to any means to have the creature destroyed.  For the suspenseful and downright eerie, ""Deathmask"" rescues season three from its mid-season creative lull and sets the stage for several thrilling episodes that were to air in the next several weeks. ""Deathmask"" features Gerald McRanney in his last appearance in The Incredible Hulk as a detective who is investigating murders on a college campus. When David is arrested for the attempted murder of one of the co-eds, he realizes that he is closer to the killer than he thinks.

Although season three has its weak spots, it should be applauded for its innovative interactions and close calls between Banner and Jack Magee.  Several episodes have Magee unknowlingly in the company of Banner (""Behind the Wheel"") as well as knowlingly in the company of Banner (""Equinox""). In ""Broken Image"", Bixby plays the dual role of Banner and a wanted crimnial. This leads to an interesting confrontation between Banner and the inquisitive reporter, who swears that David Banner is indeed alive, but is then led to believe otherwise. In ""The Psychic"", mitigating circumstances have Banner feeling compelled to save Magee's life. ""The Psychic"" features Bixby's ex-wife Brenda Benet and is a must see season three episode.  Last but not least, ""Proof Positive"" focuses on the lonely life of Jack Magee, and how Magee's obssession with the creature has now taken over his life.  The most un-Hulk like episode of the series, ""Proff Positive"" is the only episode not to feature Bill Bixby, who was wrapped up in divorce proceedings and was unavailable for filming. Nonetheless, the episode is another MUST SEE, and is an effective as well as entertaining way to show the perspective of the underrated and at times underused Jack Magee as portrayed by the late actor Jack Colvin.

Overall, not as good as season two, but nothing close to the unwatchable season five. And for those of you no totally satisfied with season three, not to worry. Season three packs a pretty good punch, but season four returns with a bang! And guess what: You can get it on the same day!!!!!",1207440000,6,4408,4.957994579945799

3153806,5,B001675Z2E,"It's about time that they put this 1979-80 Season on DVD, especially since this season was even more sophisticated than the first 2 seasons.  The 3rd Season also has some significant episodes like ""Proof Positive"", ""Broken Image"", ""Metamorphosis"", ""The Snare"", ""The Psychic"", etc.

The 1979-1980 Season also has some significant guest stars in it like
*Gerald McRaney in the ""Deathmask"" days before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo P.I.(Rick Simon) on SIMON & SIMON and before McRaney's co-starring days on MAJOR DAD, PROMISED LAND, & TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL

*Esther Rolle in the ""Behind The Wheel"" episode after her co-starring days on GOOD TIMES

*Mackenzie Phillips in the ""Metamorphosis"" episode after her co-starring days on ONE DAY AT A TIME

*Ray Walston in the ""My Favorite Magician"" episode after his co-starring days with Bill Bixby on MY FAVORITE MARTIAN

*Nicholas Coster in the ""Blind Rage"" episode known for his co-starring days on SHERIFF LOBO, ONE LIFE TO LIVE, ALL MY CHILDREN, and SANTA BARBARA

*Dennis Hollahan in the ""Captive Night"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Robert Davi in ""The Slam"" episode before his co-starring days on PROFILER

*Sandra Kerns in the ""Jake"" episode before her co-starring days on CHARLES IN CHARGE

*Judith Chapman in the ""Sideshow"" episode before her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Anne Lockhart in the ""Captive Night"" episode after her co-starring days on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*John Reilly in the ""Broken Image"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Lee Bryant in the ""Blind Rage"" episode before her co-starring days as Sgt. Hooker's sentimental ex-wife(Fran Hooker)on the police drama T.J. HOOKER

In addition to what makes the 3rd Season significant, in the ""Proof Positive"" episode while an arrogant interim newspaper manager(Caroline Smith)briefly takes over the National Register in Chicago; Jack McGhee(Jack Colvin)reminisces about his never-ending obession with the Hulk and how it has taken control of his life explaining what a real loner McGhee was by using scenes from previous episodes from the first 3 seasons.

In the ""Metamorphosis"" episode, the reclusive David Banner(Bill Bixby)helps out an overwhelmed rock-star(Mackenzie Phillips) who is feeling down on her luck under pressure helping her to see the light at the end of the tunnel at the end of that episode after she nearly kills herself at a big concert.

In ""The Snare"" episode, an eccentric wildlife hunter(Bradford Dillman)becomes obsessed with hunting down human beings instead of animals and then ends up wanting to use the Hulk as prey instead by ending up instigating the transformation of the Hulk at the end.

In the ""Deathmask"" a disgruntled corrupt police chief(Gerald McRaney)responsible for a rash of homicides at a University in a remote college town uses David as a fall guy to convince people that the real killer has finally been caught, but results in disaster when local residents unionize and turn the little town upside down by instigating a riot and when a lynch mob tries to kill David just before his 2nd hulkout.

It was interesting seeing Bix play a dual role in the ""Broken Image"" episode when David gets mistaken for a wanted sadistic look-alike ex-con(Michael Cassidy), watching Bill Bixby doing ""The Psychic"" episode with his ex-wife(Brenda Benet) and watching Bill Bixby reunite with his former co-star(Ray Walston) from the 1960's sitcom MY FAVORITE MARTIAN in the ""My Favorite Magician"" episode too.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE INCREDIBLE HULK was part of CBS's Friday night line-up starting with THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM, followed by THE DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM; and then topped off by DALLAS at 10PM.

So I would have to say that the Third Season of THE INCREDIBLE HULK was probably the 2nd best season of them all throughout it's whole 4-year run on CBS, plus I think the Third Season of the Hulk is even better and more sophisticated than the First Season and the Second Season and I recommend the 3rd Season to anyone who liked the first two seasons of this show.",1206403200,6,4159,5.088235294117647

It's clean.
Makes me LOL.
Watch "" Broken Image"". LoL David being mistaken for "" Mike Cassidy"" is such fluff, you can't help but watch and pick flies. They did a terrible job of convincing us it was another man. All they did was stick a mustache on him and grey his temples. It's hilarious to think we don't know it's the same person.
 Not only that, as danger approaches for David, you get that ""music"" in the background amping up the drama that's about to unfold.
Love that this show Deals with issues - subtly - on every level. Racism - the episode 14 ""falling Angels""; Episode on being handicapped; anger issues; teens and alcoholism; cults; mind games; killing for profit. Need I say more!
I travel and stay in hotels, every week, this is my ""go to"". Now that it's being removed from Netflix I shall buy it on Amazon. Download it and watch it when traveling without the internet.l whenever I want. That's a nice treat.

3153854,4,B001675Z2E,"The Incredible Hulk, Season 3: List Of Episodes with short reviews

1. Metamorphosis: A reasonable social statement about the sensationalistic side of heavy metal rock n roll which unfairly portrays its management as vampires and vultures with no care for its effects upon the youth, while missing the whole point of such music to begin with; as a way for the youth to relieve pressure on weekends without turning to actual criminal activities. The episode unfairly stereotypes the rock n roll industry, insults the intelligence of the people within it, and blames them for the violent actions made by the ignorant youth that listen to it. I'm thoroughly sick of propagandists blaming substances and mediums for the abuse and misuse of ignorant consumers. When some people don't know how to appreciate freedom like civilized adults, then that means everyone should have their freedom taken away, right? * *

2. Blind Rage: Very noteworthy case of careless toxic waste disposal by a military base which leads to blindness and death of innocent bystanders. Much more to worry about here than a few drunken kids brawling at a rock n roll concert. Banner sneaks a peak at the formula for the toxin and points the base doctor in the right direction for a cure, just before he goes blind himself and turns into the Hulk. The Hulk, of course, manages to save his eyesight, after battling a tank and a unit of soldiers on a booby-trapped obstacle course. * * *

3. Brain Child: A teenage genius sneaks away from the government goons guarding her to go looking for her mother who abandoned her years earlier. She hooks up with Banner and the goons fake a story to the local law that she was kidnapped so that they'll work harder to locate her and get her back. Unfortunately, Banner is pegged as the kidnapper, but he manages to help the girl find her mother in spite of the chase. * * *

4. The Slam: Of course, no series like this is complete without the case of the corrupt southern prison-camp way out in the rural boondocks. Prisoners do long sentences for misdemeanors and simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they're used as slave-laborers while the prison collects the payment for services rendered. Banner is arrested for picking an apple from a tree. * *

5. My Favorite Magician: Ray Walston, who played Uncle Martin in My Favorite Martian during the early 60s, which also had Bill Bixby as the nephew, plays an over-the-hill average magician and hooks up with Banner while doing a show and seeking to help his female ex-assistant, who is being preyed upon by a fake Romeo who plans on stealing her wealthy estate for the mob he works for.
* *

6. Jake: Banner works with a rodeo and gets mixed up with brothers who own a rig and are being bullied by modern-day cattle-rustlers. One of them is sick with a serious illness but insists on working and ignoring his health, while Banner tries to convince him to see a doctor. *

7. Behind the Wheel: A big city cab company owner suckers Banner into driving for her without telling him that a loan-shark and a gang are sabotaging the business, forcing her to turn it over to them because she cannot pay back the loan and is in debt over her head. Of course, illegal drugs are involved also. * * *

8. Homecoming: Banner visits his sister and father at the farm where he grew up, mixes it up with lots of emotional flashbacks, and tries to save the farm from a genetically-engineered bug that threatens to destroy the staple crops. A corporate tycoon is behind the engineering with plans to force the local farmers to sell so that he can build a city. * * * *

9. The Snare: A thoroughly spoiled-brat independently wealthy hunter lures Banner to a private island where he hunts game for sport, and decides to hunt Banner for sport also. Of course, after Banner turns into the Hulk, the man is overwhelmed with the thrill of his life-time, and determined to force Banner to change again for his amusement under humiliation and torture. * * *

10. Babalao: New Orleans Mardi Gras season is the setting and hoodoo con-artists using scare-tactics and fear to prey upon the local working-class poor is the theme. I dunno how much lower anyone can get than this. The people in this have next to nothing to begin with; why do they waste their time shaking the pennies from their pockets? Banner works with the local goody-two-shoes doctor who runs a clinic while the hoodoo con-artists try to run her out of business. *

11. Captive Night: Banner works in a city department store over-night doing inventory with a sales-girl and one security-guard when an ex-employee sneaks in the back with his big-brother ex-con to rob the safe. Things don't go so well for the cons when they mix up with the 3 night-workers and then discover that the old safe has been replaced by a large upgraded safe with a time-lock. * * *

12. Broken Image: Banner is mistaken for a thief in hiding who looks just like him and the law chases him into the hands of the guys he stole the money from. The Hulk gets him out, but the real thief latches on a plan to use Banner to help him disappear. * * * *

13. Proof Positive: A day in the life of Jack McGee, star reporter and hunter of the Hulk. While the publisher is on a honeymoon in the south seas, his college-brat daughter takes over and tries to reform the paper to fit her tastes. Lots of friction ensues when she insists upon dropping the Hulk story and exposes it as an obsession with McGee. * * * *

14. Sideshow: Banner goes to work for a group of female carnival dancers and helps one who is being harrassed and terrorized by a god-fearing old man who blames her for the loss of his son. * *

15. Long Run Home: Banner gets a ride from a motorcyclist who is heading away from a gang to a farm but the gang is involved in gun-running over the borders and they think he snitched on them after the ATF breaks up a business deal. * * *

16. Falling Angels: Banner runs into some young female orphans, gets a job working with their orphanage, and learns they are being taught to steal for the guy that oversees the place. * *

17. The Lottery: Banner befriends a guy who runs a newstand in the big city, hangs out with him at his place for a few days, and wins big in the local lottery. Banner can't collect the money, convinces his friend to collect it for him, and the guy disappears with the money. Banner locates him in the top suite of a high-rise hotel running a con as a Latin-American General selling offshore oil-well rights to a couple of small-time oil tycoons. * * * *

18. The Psychic: Banner gets blamed, as the Hulk, for the life-threatening injury of a teenager and a psychic who touches him and discovers his secret calls Jack McGee to turn him in for the reward. Later, when she sees Banner in the hospital waiting-room, she sees something else about him and changes her mind. The two become friends but then the boy dies and Banner is broken up inside, until she tells him that Jack McGee is going to be killed and they both go to his rescue. * * *

19. A Rock and a Hard Place: Banner stays at the house of an old woman with mysterious criminal roots from way-back around prohibition in the early 20th century, not realizing that she still has criminal plans. After she uses him to deliver dynamite without him knowing it and he's caught by the feds, the feds use him to spy on her. I dunno where they come up with this stuff. *

20. Deathmask: While working at the library of a college in a rural college-town, a series of murders of young blonde female college students occurs and Banner is mistaken for the killer. The chief of police holds him in a secure room at the police-station and interrogates him, trying to get him to confess. But the interrogation goes on for 2 days and nights and eventually, the police chief (played by Gerald McRaney) starts to talk to him about philosophical, social, and psychological subjects, while recognizing that Banner possesses a college-level intellect and gives him respect and understanding. Excellent psychopathological case-study by Gerald McRaney, definitely one of his best performances. * * * *

21. Equinox: Banner gets trapped on an island at the estate of a wealthy spoiled-brat heiress during her Equinox Party and Jack McGee sneaks onto the island and into the party to look for him. Meanwhile, someone tries to kill the spoiled-brat, and of course, Banner is blamed. * *

22. Nine Hours: A young boy in a city ghetto gets kidnapped by mobsters to use in exchange for Banner's help getting into the hospital he works at night to kill an old mob-boss who plans on turning state-evidence to the feds. * * *

23. On the Line: Banner is drafted to work with forest-service fire-fighters and learns that someone is setting the fires intentionally. Jack McGee gets a job on the line after learning the Hulk was seen in the area. * *

* One star = Poor, * * Two stars = Okay, * * * Three stars = Good, * * * * Four stars = Very Good.",1233100800,8,8990,4.4710189139719345
3153855,5,B001675Z2E,"I have just begun to watch the third season of the Hulk TV show. The show has tons on unintentional humor, but most fans seem to be blind to this fact. I wasn't a big fan of this show when it was on TV because of such a loose adaption of one of my favorite comic book heroes.

The show has grown on me, but it's really pretty silly and camp. In this season, The Hulk joins a rock band's crew and gets slipped a Mickey (of LSD), uncovers an army SNAFU, gets put on a chain gang, becomes a magician's apprentice(reuniting Bixby with his old co-star Ray Waltson from My Favorite Martian), joins a rodeo and more. This season's release has a documentary and a look at the 2008 Hulk movie. The DVD transfer is very good.

I am in my late 30's, so I was around 8 or so when the Incredible Hulk first came to television back in the late 70's/early 80's. I have some memories of a few of the episodes and watching them again after all this time is pretty cool. :-) Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno did a great job on the show. Too bad that the execs at CBS thought the show was too expensive - it could have gone on for a few more good years.

3388299,4,B001675Z2E,"The Third Season of The Incredible Hulk in many ways betters Seasons One and Two. The stories here are overall more exciting than in the Second Season and there are fewer lulls. You also get more insight into David Banner and (very pleasingly) Jack McGee. But there's one thing I did miss here; Two-parters. Season Two had the knockout episodes ""Married"" and
""Mystery Man"" which were stretched to feature length. Here the episode ""Homecoming"" could easily have been a two-parter. David finds his way back home and makes up with his sister and father, whom he had always blamed for the death of his mother. It's a great episode which only fault is that it's too short.

Some great highlights here include ""The Snare"" and ""The Psychic"" which are two outstanding episodes. ""The Snare"" lifts it's plot from the short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" which has been filmed several times. A recluse hunter on a remote island invites David to spend the night and before you know it David is fighting for his life for the hunter has become bored with hunting animals. ""The Psychic"" is very emotional with some incredibly sad overtones. Bixby's former wife Brenda Benet plays the psychic, who can see what David becomes and she also forsees Jack McGee's imminent death. Those who know something about Bixby's life will know that Benet committed suicide excactly one year after the death of their son Christopher. ""The Psychic"" aired shortly after Benet and Bixby had gone through a tough divorce. Both give exceptional performances here.

Some episodes which are considered lulls I actually found very entertaining. ""Blind Rage"" was a thrilling episode where David becomes blind, ""The Slam"" was an entertaining episode where David gets arrested and sent to a work camp. That episode also stars Robert Davi and Charles Napier. Softer episodes such as ""Long Road Home"" and ""Falling Angels"", which are considered not good, well I found them very entertaining.

""Broken Image"", ""Death Mask"" and ""Equinox"" are also outstanding episodes. ""Broken Image"" is the one where Banner and McGee meet face to face, ""Death Mask"" is where Banner is suspected of multiple murders and ""Equinox"" is the one where McGee corners Banner in a costume party. They're all great. It's also great to see a whole episode devoted entirely to Jack McGee in ""Proof Positive"" and the late Jack Colvin excels there, as always.

The guest stars in the Third Season are much better than in the previous two seasons. There's much more consistency in the acting department here with supporting actors and that's one of the things that particularly plagued the Second Season. Bradford Dillman was a great villain in ""The Snare"", Paul Koslo is especially appealing in ""The Long Road Home"", Robert Hogan is marvellous as the scam artist in the mediocre episode ""The Lottery"", Brenda Benet is superb in ""The Psychic"", Gerald McRaney is very good and creepy in ""Death Mask"", Marc Alaimo showed some strong acting in ""Nine Hours"" and John Marley was fantastic is Banner's father in ""Homecoming"". An episode always goes down better with good performances from it's guest stars and there's no shortage of that here.

Not many episodes were dull but if I had to name someone I'd go with ""Babalao"" and ""Sideshow"". Those were below average.

Overall, this is a strong season of The Incredible Hulk. Bill Bixby doesn't falter once as David Banner, Jack Colvin is excellent as Jack McGee and Lou Ferrigno is up to the task again.",1214438400,12,3468,4.929794520547945
3388300,4,B001675Z2E,"For the record , I am not saying this season sucks, because it didn't, but what I am saying is it doesn't hold up as seasons one two or four. My first critisism is that the season opener and finale were by far some of the dumbest episodes ever , I know that most everybody hates the episode Babalou or however it is spelled , but for now I cannot comment on this it has been a long time since I have seen that one. the other thing is since they really didn't have the hulk wearing his torn shirts anymore which is what I liked as a kid (which it looked like they tried to bring that back on what was the few of season five), they started doing the torn pants which was kinda better ,but it made seasons one and two look ironic,on why it took season three for them to come up with that . plus they seen they couldn't make up there minds on if they were going to do it on all episodes. however the show was not in vain as it did have some great episodes my favorite being ""deathmask"". I always liked seeing films where serial killers who prey on women get whats coming  to them. I would have also wanted them to have made a sequel to ""homecoming"" on later episodes or seasons. And how his family coped with his problem. But this season as well as the whole series is worth purchasing they quality of the pictures are restored very well, but I wonder why Universal could restor all the hulk episode, but stopped on later season releases of ""Emergency""?",1212883200,2,1449,4.175
3388301,3,B001675Z2E,"After the hugely successful 78-79 season, The Incredible Hulk returned to CBS in the fall of '79 looking to duplicate its success of the previous year. However, the strong points of season two unfortunately were the weak points of season three. While the season is marked with some of the series' best episodes, several of the worst episodes can also be found in the mix. Where season two usually has Banner's life being threatened about once every couple months, seaosn three has Banner finding himself in the season one predicaments (getting tied up, beaten up) more often than not. Throw in some below average storylines and as a whole, season three winds up pretty uneven, but still definately worth a look.

First the average: ""Metamorphosis"" (with the exception of the abbreviated season five) is easily the weakest opener of the series, with guest star Mackenzie Phillips' problems in the episode overshadowing her real life demons. Human interest stories such as ""Jake"", ""Falling Angels"", ""Sideshow"", and ""My Favorite Magician"" (which reunites Bill Bixby and Ray Walston from their ""My Favorite Martian"" days) are feeble attempts to rekindle the magic of season two in which David comes to the aid of the guest star of the week. In saying this, ""Magician"" is worth a look if only to see Bixby and Walston for one last time.  Episodes such as ""Long Run Home"", and ""The Lottery"" are not horrendous, but more or less represent the middle of a mediocre season that at times, seemed to struggle in the creativity department.

The embarassing: Episodes such as ""Babalao"", and the season finale ""On the Line"", are downright atrocious and should pretty much be skipped altogether.

Now to the good: ""The Slam"" is probably one of the most underrated Hulk episodes that season three has to offer. I won't give things away, but you can't keep The Hulk caged for too long!  In ""Homecoming"", David returns home to his sister and estranged father. An emotional rollercoaster from start to finish, ""Homecoming"" is arguably the best episode of season three and definately one of the highlights of the entire series. This episode CANNOT be missed.  While not as powerful as ""Homecoming"", ""The Snare"" finds David in a fight for his life as a derranged hunter who witnesses Banner's transformation into the Hulk resorts to any means to have the creature destroyed.  For the suspenseful and downright eerie, ""Deathmask"" rescues season three from its mid-season creative lull and sets the stage for several thrilling episodes that were to air in the next several weeks. ""Deathmask"" features Gerald McRanney in his last appearance in The Incredible Hulk as a detective who is investigating murders on a college campus. When David is arrested for the attempted murder of one of the co-eds, he realizes that he is closer to the killer than he thinks.

Although season three has its weak spots, it should be applauded for its innovative interactions and close calls between Banner and Jack Magee.  Several episodes have Magee unknowlingly in the company of Banner (""Behind the Wheel"") as well as knowlingly in the company of Banner (""Equinox""). In ""Broken Image"", Bixby plays the dual role of Banner and a wanted crimnial. This leads to an interesting confrontation between Banner and the inquisitive reporter, who swears that David Banner is indeed alive, but is then led to believe otherwise. In ""The Psychic"", mitigating circumstances have Banner feeling compelled to save Magee's life. ""The Psychic"" features Bixby's ex-wife Brenda Benet and is a must see season three episode.  Last but not least, ""Proof Positive"" focuses on the lonely life of Jack Magee, and how Magee's obssession with the creature has now taken over his life.  The most un-Hulk like episode of the series, ""Proff Positive"" is the only episode not to feature Bill Bixby, who was wrapped up in divorce proceedings and was unavailable for filming. Nonetheless, the episode is another MUST SEE, and is an effective as well as entertaining way to show the perspective of the underrated and at times underused Jack Magee as portrayed by the late actor Jack Colvin.

Overall, not as good as season two, but nothing close to the unwatchable season five. And for those of you no totally satisfied with season three, not to worry. Season three packs a pretty good punch, but season four returns with a bang! And guess what: You can get it on the same day!!!!!",1207440000,6,4408,4.957994579945799

The 3rd Season also has some significant episodes like ""Proof Positive"", ""Broken Image"", ""Metamorphosis"", ""The Snare"", ""The Psychic"", etc.

The 1979-1980 Season also has some significant guest stars in it like
*Gerald McRaney in the ""Deathmask"" days before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo P.I.(Rick Simon) on SIMON & SIMON and before McRaney's co-starring days on MAJOR DAD, PROMISED LAND, & TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL

*Esther Rolle in the ""Behind The Wheel"" episode after her co-starring days on GOOD TIMES

*Mackenzie Phillips in the ""Metamorphosis"" episode after her co-starring days on ONE DAY AT A TIME

*Ray Walston in the ""My Favorite Magician"" episode after his co-starring days with Bill Bixby on MY FAVORITE MARTIAN

*Nicholas Coster in the ""Blind Rage"" episode known for his co-starring days on SHERIFF LOBO, ONE LIFE TO LIVE, ALL MY CHILDREN, and SANTA BARBARA

*Dennis Hollahan in the ""Captive Night"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Robert Davi in ""The Slam"" episode before his co-starring days on PROFILER

*Sandra Kerns in the ""Jake"" episode before her co-starring days on CHARLES IN CHARGE

*Judith Chapman in the ""Sideshow"" episode before her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Anne Lockhart in the ""Captive Night"" episode after her co-starring days on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*John Reilly in the ""Broken Image"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Lee Bryant in the ""Blind Rage"" episode before her co-starring days as Sgt. Hooker's sentimental ex-wife(Fran Hooker)on the police drama T.J. HOOKER

In addition to what makes the 3rd Season significant, in the ""Proof Positive"" episode while an arrogant interim newspaper manager(Caroline Smith)briefly takes over the National Register in Chicago; Jack McGhee(Jack Colvin)reminisces about his never-ending obession with the Hulk and how it has taken control of his life explaining what a real loner McGhee was by using scenes from previous episodes from the first 3 seasons.

In the ""Metamorphosis"" episode, the reclusive David Banner(Bill Bixby)helps out an overwhelmed rock-star(Mackenzie Phillips) who is feeling down on her luck under pressure helping her to see the light at the end of the tunnel at the end of that episode after she nearly kills herself at a big concert.

In ""The Snare"" episode, an eccentric wildlife hunter(Bradford Dillman)becomes obsessed with hunting down human beings instead of animals and then ends up wanting to use the Hulk as prey instead by ending up instigating the transformation of the Hulk at the end.

In the ""Deathmask"" a disgruntled corrupt police chief(Gerald McRaney)responsible for a rash of homicides at a University in a remote college town uses David as a fall guy to convince people that the real killer has finally been caught, but results in disaster when local residents unionize and turn the little town upside down by instigating a riot and when a lynch mob tries to kill David just before his 2nd hulkout.

It was interesting seeing Bix play a dual role in the ""Broken Image"" episode when David gets mistaken for a wanted sadistic look-alike ex-con(Michael Cassidy), watching Bill Bixby doing ""The Psychic"" episode with his ex-wife(Brenda Benet) and watching Bill Bixby reunite with his former co-star(Ray Walston) from the 1960's sitcom MY FAVORITE MARTIAN in the ""My Favorite Magician"" episode too.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE INCREDIBLE HULK was part of CBS's Friday night line-up starting with THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM, followed by THE DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM; and then topped off by DALLAS at 10PM.

So I would have to say that the Third Season of THE INCREDIBLE HULK was probably the 2nd best season of them all throughout it's whole 4-year run on CBS, plus I think the Third Season of the Hulk is even better and more sophisticated than the First Season and the Second Season and I recommend the 3rd Season to anyone who liked the first two seasons of this show.",1206403200,6,4159,5.088235294117647

3388315,3,B001675Z2E,"I'll be writing the same review for all 5 seasons. It's based on the quality of the DVD transfer not the show content (I love the show) .
The transfer aspect ratio is the old pan and scan made for square tube TVs.  In order to get a widescreen view I have to manually change the aspect ratio which ""stretches"" the picture and leaves the top of the screen chopped off.
I'm very disappointed and wish the studio would have taken the time to adjust the aspect.",1461456000,,457,4.252873563218391

Although toned down from his comic book counter part due to limitations of budget and lack of visual effects of the day, Lou Ferrigno  did a fine job portraying the Hulk. What set the series apart from the comics, was how well the show was able to use drama to tell a story vs heavy action. If you like the 70's and 80's era or like the superhero genere TV this is a show you will want to add your collection.",1424304000,,559,4.3238095238095235

3388351,4,B001675Z2E,"The Incredible Hulk, Season 3: List Of Episodes with short reviews

1. Metamorphosis: A reasonable social statement about the sensationalistic side of heavy metal rock n roll which unfairly portrays its management as vampires and vultures with no care for its effects upon the youth, while missing the whole point of such music to begin with; as a way for the youth to relieve pressure on weekends without turning to actual criminal activities. The episode unfairly stereotypes the rock n roll industry, insults the intelligence of the people within it, and blames them for the violent actions made by the ignorant youth that listen to it. I'm thoroughly sick of propagandists blaming substances and mediums for the abuse and misuse of ignorant consumers. When some people don't know how to appreciate freedom like civilized adults, then that means everyone should have their freedom taken away, right? * *

2. Blind Rage: Very noteworthy case of careless toxic waste disposal by a military base which leads to blindness and death of innocent bystanders. Much more to worry about here than a few drunken kids brawling at a rock n roll concert. Banner sneaks a peak at the formula for the toxin and points the base doctor in the right direction for a cure, just before he goes blind himself and turns into the Hulk. The Hulk, of course, manages to save his eyesight, after battling a tank and a unit of soldiers on a booby-trapped obstacle course. * * *

3. Brain Child: A teenage genius sneaks away from the government goons guarding her to go looking for her mother who abandoned her years earlier. She hooks up with Banner and the goons fake a story to the local law that she was kidnapped so that they'll work harder to locate her and get her back. Unfortunately, Banner is pegged as the kidnapper, but he manages to help the girl find her mother in spite of the chase. * * *

4. The Slam: Of course, no series like this is complete without the case of the corrupt southern prison-camp way out in the rural boondocks. Prisoners do long sentences for misdemeanors and simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they're used as slave-laborers while the prison collects the payment for services rendered. Banner is arrested for picking an apple from a tree. * *

5. My Favorite Magician: Ray Walston, who played Uncle Martin in My Favorite Martian during the early 60s, which also had Bill Bixby as the nephew, plays an over-the-hill average magician and hooks up with Banner while doing a show and seeking to help his female ex-assistant, who is being preyed upon by a fake Romeo who plans on stealing her wealthy estate for the mob he works for.
* *

6. Jake: Banner works with a rodeo and gets mixed up with brothers who own a rig and are being bullied by modern-day cattle-rustlers. One of them is sick with a serious illness but insists on working and ignoring his health, while Banner tries to convince him to see a doctor. *

7. Behind the Wheel: A big city cab company owner suckers Banner into driving for her without telling him that a loan-shark and a gang are sabotaging the business, forcing her to turn it over to them because she cannot pay back the loan and is in debt over her head. Of course, illegal drugs are involved also. * * *

8. Homecoming: Banner visits his sister and father at the farm where he grew up, mixes it up with lots of emotional flashbacks, and tries to save the farm from a genetically-engineered bug that threatens to destroy the staple crops. A corporate tycoon is behind the engineering with plans to force the local farmers to sell so that he can build a city. * * * *

9. The Snare: A thoroughly spoiled-brat independently wealthy hunter lures Banner to a private island where he hunts game for sport, and decides to hunt Banner for sport also. Of course, after Banner turns into the Hulk, the man is overwhelmed with the thrill of his life-time, and determined to force Banner to change again for his amusement under humiliation and torture. * * *

10. Babalao: New Orleans Mardi Gras season is the setting and hoodoo con-artists using scare-tactics and fear to prey upon the local working-class poor is the theme. I dunno how much lower anyone can get than this. The people in this have next to nothing to begin with; why do they waste their time shaking the pennies from their pockets? Banner works with the local goody-two-shoes doctor who runs a clinic while the hoodoo con-artists try to run her out of business. *

11. Captive Night: Banner works in a city department store over-night doing inventory with a sales-girl and one security-guard when an ex-employee sneaks in the back with his big-brother ex-con to rob the safe. Things don't go so well for the cons when they mix up with the 3 night-workers and then discover that the old safe has been replaced by a large upgraded safe with a time-lock. * * *

12. Broken Image: Banner is mistaken for a thief in hiding who looks just like him and the law chases him into the hands of the guys he stole the money from. The Hulk gets him out, but the real thief latches on a plan to use Banner to help him disappear. * * * *

13. Proof Positive: A day in the life of Jack McGee, star reporter and hunter of the Hulk. While the publisher is on a honeymoon in the south seas, his college-brat daughter takes over and tries to reform the paper to fit her tastes. Lots of friction ensues when she insists upon dropping the Hulk story and exposes it as an obsession with McGee. * * * *

14. Sideshow: Banner goes to work for a group of female carnival dancers and helps one who is being harrassed and terrorized by a god-fearing old man who blames her for the loss of his son. * *

15. Long Run Home: Banner gets a ride from a motorcyclist who is heading away from a gang to a farm but the gang is involved in gun-running over the borders and they think he snitched on them after the ATF breaks up a business deal. * * *

16. Falling Angels: Banner runs into some young female orphans, gets a job working with their orphanage, and learns they are being taught to steal for the guy that oversees the place. * *

17. The Lottery: Banner befriends a guy who runs a newstand in the big city, hangs out with him at his place for a few days, and wins big in the local lottery. Banner can't collect the money, convinces his friend to collect it for him, and the guy disappears with the money. Banner locates him in the top suite of a high-rise hotel running a con as a Latin-American General selling offshore oil-well rights to a couple of small-time oil tycoons. * * * *

18. The Psychic: Banner gets blamed, as the Hulk, for the life-threatening injury of a teenager and a psychic who touches him and discovers his secret calls Jack McGee to turn him in for the reward. Later, when she sees Banner in the hospital waiting-room, she sees something else about him and changes her mind. The two become friends but then the boy dies and Banner is broken up inside, until she tells him that Jack McGee is going to be killed and they both go to his rescue. * * *

19. A Rock and a Hard Place: Banner stays at the house of an old woman with mysterious criminal roots from way-back around prohibition in the early 20th century, not realizing that she still has criminal plans. After she uses him to deliver dynamite without him knowing it and he's caught by the feds, the feds use him to spy on her. I dunno where they come up with this stuff. *

20. Deathmask: While working at the library of a college in a rural college-town, a series of murders of young blonde female college students occurs and Banner is mistaken for the killer. The chief of police holds him in a secure room at the police-station and interrogates him, trying to get him to confess. But the interrogation goes on for 2 days and nights and eventually, the police chief (played by Gerald McRaney) starts to talk to him about philosophical, social, and psychological subjects, while recognizing that Banner possesses a college-level intellect and gives him respect and understanding. Excellent psychopathological case-study by Gerald McRaney, definitely one of his best performances. * * * *

21. Equinox: Banner gets trapped on an island at the estate of a wealthy spoiled-brat heiress during her Equinox Party and Jack McGee sneaks onto the island and into the party to look for him. Meanwhile, someone tries to kill the spoiled-brat, and of course, Banner is blamed. * *

22. Nine Hours: A young boy in a city ghetto gets kidnapped by mobsters to use in exchange for Banner's help getting into the hospital he works at night to kill an old mob-boss who plans on turning state-evidence to the feds. * * *

23. On the Line: Banner is drafted to work with forest-service fire-fighters and learns that someone is setting the fires intentionally. Jack McGee gets a job on the line after learning the Hulk was seen in the area. * *

* One star = Poor, * * Two stars = Okay, * * * Three stars = Good, * * * * Four stars = Very Good.",1233100800,8,8990,4.4710189139719345
3388352,5,B001675Z2E,"I have just begun to watch the third season of the Hulk TV show. The show has tons on unintentional humor, but most fans seem to be blind to this fact. I wasn't a big fan of this show when it was on TV because of such a loose adaption of one of my favorite comic book heroes.

The show has grown on me, but it's really pretty silly and camp. In this season, The Hulk joins a rock band's crew and gets slipped a Mickey (of LSD), uncovers an army SNAFU, gets put on a chain gang, becomes a magician's apprentice(reuniting Bixby with his old co-star Ray Waltson from My Favorite Martian), joins a rodeo and more. This season's release has a documentary and a look at the 2008 Hulk movie. The DVD transfer is very good.
