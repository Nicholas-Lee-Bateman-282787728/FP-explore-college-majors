3963250,5,B002OT734G,This Metallica show is just simply amazing because it takes place in a roman like colisem from ancient roman times.  The sound of the show is stunning and the four horse men are in their true form.  Again the location makes this show a priceless treasure for any Metallica fan.,1262390400,11,277,4.52
3963251,5,B002OT734G,"I pre-ordered the blu-ray, and I can say the sound and picture are amazing!

If you've seen Metallica live, than you already know that is where this band truly shines.  Now a bit about this blu-ray.

The venue is historic...a truly amazing night, unlike any venue I've ever seen.  As James proclaims, Metallica Gladiators are here!  The show is stripped down, gone is the usual large stadium walk-around stage, they have a much smaller, typical box stage here (for obvious reasons) but I think this always makes for a more intimate show, so don't expect any of the tricks and grand stage events like the prior official releases.  You get Metallica in-your-face!

The setlist is as follows:

Blackened
Creeping Death
Fuel
Harvester of Sorrow
Fade to Black
Broken, Beat and Scarred
Cyanide
Sad but True
One
All Nightmare Long
The Day That Never Comes
Master of Puppets
Dyers Eve (yah baby!!)
Nothing Else Matters
Enter Sandman (concert staple eh?)
Stone Cold Crazy
Motorbreath
Seek and Destroy

There is a short booklet with the setlist and black and white photos of the venue and the guys playing live.  Kirk and James break out some very cool guitars at this show, as a guitar player, I always like to see the new guitars so I thought I'd mention that.

Bonus features are an extensive interview with the guys individually.  Lars was interviewed outside at night and he's wearing dark shades, typical Lars!  It also includes 5 videos shot by 5 different fans, which is really cool as you probably already know Metallica has one of the largest bootleg communities of any band, so I thought that was a very cool feature to add.

The performance in my opinion was fantastic....James voice sounds really good and tight....the whole band sounds good and the bass is sweet, the crowd is not disappointing either.  A Metallica fan will really enjoy this release and if you missed the band on this tour, this is a MUST own.

As it has been mentioned in previous reviews this is a steep price.  I got this on blu-ray for 19.99, it's not available in stores here in the U.S, so shop around online before you decide where to buy it.",1262044800,2,2121,4.6738544474393535
3963252,5,B002OT734G,"As of the time of this review amazon has this for $54(discounted from $100), you can buy it for $20 on metallicas official site. The dvd is great, but not worth the price of a concert ticket.",1259452800,16,191,4.1891891891891895

3963254,5,B002OT734G,"Any serious Metallica fan should own this DVD, don't hesitate just buy it and be prepared to be blown away. I put it on the surround sound and cranked it up and loved it. It's one of the best shows they've ever done period, the venue, the fans, and the band were all outstanding. I found myself numerous times wishing I was in the front row. The sound was excellent on this DVD as well, Blackened and Fade to Black in particular are maybe the best I've heard them done live. Quit thinking about it and get it because you won't regret it.",1312329600,,537,4.223300970873787

3963256,4,B002OT734G,"I really have been out of the Metallica ring for a long time mainly because they haven't done anything worthy for years. Death Magnetic (while descent) was nothing stellar. Even saying its the best they've done in 20 years isn't saying much. Well to my delight i really enjoyed this show, usually what got on my nerves was Jame's voice and how it started cracking and sound really whiny over the years with no umph in it. This show proves much more energetic than the one in Mexico, and the sounds quality is great by comparison, also Jame's voice sounds much more rustic and the musicianship on nearly all the songs is very very tight. For example Blackened, which they kick off with at the start is very good, the pace is fast, Jame's sounds good and the rest of the band play spot on. To be honest if you listen even back in 1989 to a song like this Het's voice had a bit of a growl to it, but still wasn't incredible. Actually to i remember some earlier shows where he didn't always sing well, so i guess its nothing new, after all these years it just takes it toll. On that note stay away from Fuel, probably the worst on the DVD since Lars keeps speeding up and slowing down, i think he gets a little ""TO"" excited in his old age.

The rest of the show is quite good as well with a good mix of songs from old school to new school, i could have done without Cyanide, but loved Broken Beaten Scarred, big thumbs up for that song. Also All Nightmare Long is another good track, i really wanted to hear My Apocalypse since its the best ""and fastest"" song off that album but guess i'll have to wait. Other tracks i could have definitely done without are Sad But True, Enter Sandman, and Stone Cold Crazy all of which have been played to death. Fade to Black usually is that way as well but it was a pleasant surprise to see how energetic and tightly it was played for once, although i would have preferred Sanitarium. Dyers Eve was something i thought i would never see, from a professional filming standpoint. While Lars no longer does the double bass, and its a hard song at ""any age"" it was very notable of them to try and pull off such a hard song for a bunch of guys pushing 50. Not bad.

So overall its a very energetic impressive performance, and with it I think as far as a new album they still have enough for a least one more GREAT album if they sit and try(just not to hard). I think when Metallica strayed and went in a totally commercial direction years ago it just stuck in there heads. If they really just let it flow in the studio next time i think they could really still out do themselves and give one big last horra, if thats all they ever ever do. Every one retires and I just don't see them continuing on for long up into there 50's as with most Thrash Metal Bands. Jame's voice sounds very good on Death Magnetic, so i hope they finish touring and get to it. Now the quality of this Blu Ray wasn't quite as impressive as say Megadeth-Rust In Peace Live, but the picture quality was good, and also as some mentioned some parts did ""seem"" to be out of sync for short periods of time, off and on. I use a PS3 so i think its the best blu ray player on the market so i didn't have many issues.

So if your just an average fan these days of Metallica get this, i got mine used for 8 bucks, so it was a deal. Or if you like just catch the show on Youtube, which a lot of people do. This DVD proves that if Metallica can have a high energy show like this one, they should be able to harness that energy and put it onto another album. My main problem with them is they tour for ENTIRELY TO LONG. Get back in the studio guys, remember when they use to put an album out like every two years!! Come on.:) Btw don't bother with the Mexico show, sound is poor, performance is lackluster and sloppy compared to this. Out.",1288310400,,3828,4.1702702702702705

3963258,5,B002OT734G,"I've been waiting for this DVD for so long and after the waiting I have enjoyed the concert more than four times since I bought it. If you have the possibility to play the concert in a Home-theater system you will love it.
Excellent concert and the venue is just amazing.
Metallica Rocks!",1279584000,,288,4.452830188679245
3963259,4,B002OT734G,"The audio is out of sync for the PMC Stereo setting- even cheap discs can do that right so it`s pretty inexcusable. It's fine though for the DTS, but the music sounds a bit fuller on the PMC setting for my system. DTS would probably be better though for a high end system. And I know Metallica hates fans sharing their music without them getting a cut, but did they have to take it out on us by pricing a single disc blu-ray so high? Also for the song Nothing Else Matters, James uses some special mic that tweaks his voice almost making it sound robotic, kind of ruining a cool song imo. Lastly I would like more older stuff but The Day That Never Comes sure holds it's own. After all my gripes, it's still about the music and Metallica's so good. The picture looks amazing with an awesome venue and crowd. I'd still recommend because it's on blu-ray and rocks, but it could have been better.",1276128000,,893,4.321428571428571
3963260,5,B002OT734G,"After MUCH digging for a DECENT price on this,I picked it up from Amazon. UK. $23 USD (w/ shipping) and got it relatively quick too. For a while I'd been waiting for another awesome concert dvd/bluray,and this one does NOT dissapoint! I was at first deciding between the Mexico one and this one. After hearing the complaints about the Mexico one having no ""concert only"" option(meaning there were breaks between each song,interviews,etc) I went for this France concert-18 tracks of pure Metallica -straight through,and songs from almost EVERY album (including the new one(2009)which is what I wanted)The audio is EXCELLENT and the picture is stunning. At first,I was a LITTLE nervous,wondering ""am I going to be able to even navigate the menu?.in French?"" BUT,you get language options(and audio options,go with DTS,if you can-amazing)If you're really into picture/audio QUALITY concert blu rays-PICK IT UP..But shop around!-not sure why they don't have a U.S. version..hmmmm...",1274313600,2,977,5.392156862745098

The only thing i did not like was the stage shaking motion on some scenes, someone did not catch this before the film/recording took place.

Will recommend to anyone.",1274227200,,336,4.661016949152542

3963265,5,B002OT734G,"Picture,sound,setlist,and performance are incredible,although performance wise I felt the Mexico show had more energy. Synchronization issues drive me crazy,so I was concerned when I read on multiple sites that this was a problem with this disc. I have studied both audio options and found no issues,so I can only conclude that a)there were some defective discs ,or more likely b)it is equipment related(ex:entry level blu ray players with low quality processors combined with 60 hz lcd's).I have a late model Toshiba 240hz tv,late model Marantz sr6004 amp,and Oppo BDP83. Both amp and Blu ray player have lipsynch correction,and the combination of these quality components has eliminated a lot of the synch issues I have had on other discs. Just a theory,and on a different note,I live in Canada and ordered this disc from Amazon UK.It took 11 days to the door at $22 canadian all in.",1270684800,,885,5.068493150684931

Wonderfully shot and edited  I've watched it several times and it's still not old.  Plus there is the lengthy interview with the band members that to me is a wonderfully added bonus.

I don't think so!

Total rip-off. Amazon must order their copies from Metallica themselves, which is why it costs so much here.

3963271,1,B002OT734G,"I'm very disappointed to post this review since I was really looking forward to this concert.  I own over 20 concert blu-rays, and have only had this issue with one other disc (Rush - Snakes & Arrows blu ray), but the audio and video are not completely in sync for this concert.

I notice the sync issue mostly on the stereo audio track. I didn't notice it as much on the 5.1 DTS track. That said, I tend to notice even the slightest audio/video sync issues with DVDs and Blu-rays. I play drums, and if the audio and video are not perfectly in sync when watching the drummer (Lars in this case), I find it distracting, so much so, that I can't enjoy it at all. If you are the same way, I would have to recommend that you do not purchase this concert.

The video quality is stunning in blu-ray, though, and the venue that they perform at for this show is one of the coolest venues ever. Wish my band could play there!

Besides the fact, the dvd is just great. It is 100 percent true that everything is better in blu-ray! As soon as i put in, i can honestly say my jaw dropped. The  picture, the stage, the setting, the instruments, and Metallica look AMAZING in 1080i HD. The sound is incredible with my surround sound system of course, and  the setlist is great. They covered almost all of their CDs from Death Magnetic's Cyanide, ""The Black album"" Enter Sandman and even songs from Kill em' all.

People have complained over the years that you can't hear Lars' bass drums too well on a lot of the Live Metallica stuff.  Well this just blows it all away.  The bass drum is perfect and will melt your eardrums off.
