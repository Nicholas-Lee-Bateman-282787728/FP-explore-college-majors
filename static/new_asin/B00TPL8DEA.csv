7014583,5,B00TPL8DEA,My daughter and her friends loved this movie.  I also really enjoyed it.  Sure it has some annoying nuances - but that is certainly to be expected with any American Girl movie.

8702525,4,B00TPL8DEA,"This is good positive family friendly movie in the classic form of the American Girl films. It's a drama so i'm thinking it will be liked more by young girls than young boys. I did not like it as much as some of the other films, however it was still better than average for resent movies, and still very enjoyable to watch. If you don't like the other films you probably won't like this either. If you did like them then this will be a nice addition to the collection.",1442188800,,468,4.211111111111111
