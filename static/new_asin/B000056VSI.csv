1401834,4,B000056VSI,"This is pretty good actually, I enjoyed it. Its about this kid whos a big surfer in hawii and because of his dad, has to move and attend a prep school somewhere in the mountains where theres no waves, so he picks up a snowboard.",1050883200,,228,4.088888888888889
1401835,3,B000056VSI,"This movie was a pleasant kids film with lots of action scenes--surfing & snowbording.  Good, original plot, and a great character in Johnny Kaphaala, since he is a young man with integrity, smarts, kindness & courage.
What disturbed me most about this film was the sterotypes of the Black friend, Sam, and the white rich kids, the Skys.  I don't understand why the Black guy always gotta be the ""hip"" one, saying things like ""it's all good"", etc. (actually Johnny says that but you know what I'm talking about).  Like that one Black character said in ""Not Another Teen Movie"".  It was ridiculous that the Black kid was the epitome of cool, with his ""dreadlocked"" snow hat.
Then the rich white kids' leader, Brett, was the nastiest of nasties.  Rude beyond belief.  I don't know, I just didn't like the portrayal of good vs. bad in this film.  They coulda mixed it up racially more, but hey, I guess it was Vermont...(am I stereotyping Vermont now?  lol!)",1029801600,3,955,4.676646706586826
1401836,5,B000056VSI,Tsunami is easily the greatest movie I have ever seen.  The battle between the Skys and Urchins is only the start of this phenomenal plot. Surfing world champion Johnny Kapahaala moves from Hawaii to Vermont.  Johnny's Dad is played by Karate Kid Two's Chosen and he does a great job!  His grandfather is Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat and he catches some huge swells.  There is a lot of action in this movie- great surfing and snowboarding sequences!  It is a must see.  I would write more but I don't want to give away the movie.,984960000,5,531,4.479166666666667
1401837,5,B000056VSI,"I love Disney Channel Original Movies! They are fun for the whole family! This one is about Johnny! His grandfather is a surfing legend known as Johnny Tsunami. And he is about to fil his grandfathers shoes. But his dad and step mom make him move. To Alaska! He has trouble fitting in. But soon finds out that The hip sport their is snowboarding. Johnny also gets a crush and makes enimies with her boyfriend.

This movie teaches kids to make good choices and about family and friends! I recommend you go rent it today!",982108800,,708,4.5390625

pretty good ones! This is the story of Johnny Tsunami. He lives in
hawaii and is a great surfer. He would have been famous like his
grandfather if his dad and step mom hadn't made him move to alaska. He
has a hard time fitting in, But makes a friend and quickly learns the
next best thing to surfing, snowboarding. He deals with his bully, his
crush, and leaving his home behind ...",981763200,2,448,4.2823529411764705

1402145,1,B000056VSI,"I have found this movie at tower records, Dimple, and many other places for $4. Charging this much for a movie is totally ripping everyone off. The movie wasent that good, and you really need to lower  the price if you want people to buy this junk. Sorry",1136419200,3,254,4.291666666666667
1402146,3,B000056VSI,"Johnny Kapahaala is living the good life: friends, beach, and awesome surfing.  The only thing that threatens to ruin his fun is his dad, who approves of surfing just as much as Johnny would approve of being bitten by a shark.  When the Kapahaalas make an unexpected move to Vermont, Johnny's father encourages him to make friends and do well at his new school.  But Johnny would rather daydream about surfing, and talk to his grandpa in Hawaii while wishing that he was there to surf under the sun, too.  Will Johnny ever get used to his new oceanless home?  Maybe, just maybe, he could find a way to surf WITHOUT the water.

This is an okay movie.  Some parts were pretty unrealistic, and the whole ""father just doesn't understand"" thing can get just a teeny bit old sometimes, even though it makes things interesting.  There was nothing ""special"" about this movie.  It's mostly just a movie that you watch when there's nothing better to do.  Overall, I would only buy this movie if you're a die hard fan of Kirsten Storms (she's in it) or one of the other actors in it.  There are better tween movies out there, not to mention that you can watch them and ""Johnny Tsunami"" on Disney Channel for free.",1116892800,,1202,4.518518518518518
