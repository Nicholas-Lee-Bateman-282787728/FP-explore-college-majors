4207381,1,B003UTUYAO,this was a mistake to buy and I really regret it and wish I had not. I would not recommend it o any one,1375315200,,103,3.3333333333333335
4207382,4,B003UTUYAO,"I really enjoyed the premise of this program.  It has a lot of elements of the typical law enforcement show spiced up by excellent acting, but with a bit of a sci-fi twist and an extra dash of drama.  Another aspect of the show that captured my attention is that since the program was produced in 2009, this show included some stars who later appeared in Lost Girl, a current favorite.",1350691200,8,385,4.408450704225352
4207383,5,B003UTUYAO,"I was sold a DVD which I could NOT play in the USA which did me absolutely no good.  I watch this program on ION TV and would love to have DVDs of the five seasons that have shown, at least in part, on the TV.  I called Amazon to ask about being sold a DVD that I cannot play and the representative on the phone said I could change the setting on my laptop, but then nothing else I have would be watchable.  Then he suggested I buy equipment just to watch this one, as you cannot switch back and forth more than twice.  I ended up returning it without ever watching it, so I am taping it on VHS tapes off of ION TV.  I was out the cost of shipping and have learned my lesson.",1430352000,2,675,3.86231884057971
4207384,5,B003UTUYAO,"I bought a multi-region DVD/blu-ray player from Amazon.com at a fantastic price.  There are a lot of choices.  They play U.S. DVDs as well.  I now get to watch series from Canada, the UK, Australia and France.  Now I get to see so many great shows!  I'm glad I've got my region-free player.  I did not receive compensation to say this; it's absolutely true and I thought it would help customers get the DVDS they want and not have to wait for the U.S. region only.  I can even get DVDS from Amazon Canada if My Amazon does not carry it.
I got the first season of Transporter:the series as well The Listener.  Both these series are excellent!  The casts are impressive and both shows are great for binge-watching.  Hopefully, the complete series of The Listener will come out soon.",1429401600,9,780,4.507142857142857
4207385,4,B003UTUYAO,"I love The Listener.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the fourth disc to play, something about it being made in Italy and neither my computer or my DVD player will play it.  Would like to hear someone's explanation, or, better yet, solution.",1429315200,,239,4.804878048780488

4207389,1,B003UTUYAO,no review because it doesn't come out in Region 1.  We want it in the US.... I caught the show on TV and have loved it.  Now we need it here...Ready Amazon - GO!!!,1419552000,6,163,3.764705882352941
4207390,5,B003UTUYAO,The Listener is an excellent drama with humor.  The writer hangs together lots of twists and turns in the script and the actions seem like real life.  Highly recommended.,1419465600,4,170,4.827586206896552
4207391,5,B003UTUYAO,Played it on my computer since it said it would not run on a DVD but still was great and I intend to get other seasons,1417910400,2,118,3.576923076923077
4207392,5,B003UTUYAO,Love this show wish they would have the other 3 seasons available since they are now airing season 5.  Hopefully they will and have them for region 1 for all of us who do love this show.,1414627200,19,186,4.027027027027027
8406157,5,B003UTUYAO,"Wish I had the entire series!  Great stories.  And yes, I did catch the notice about the Region Free DVD player-I emailed the company, (RareConsoles) got a reply in a very few minutes-yes, need to get one, will not play on my old DVD player.  I was able to order a great DVD player for a very reasonable price, everything arrived quickly so I am very happy, no problems. Finding a player for this is not big deal, seriously.
Stayed glued to it for a few days until I watched the entire season-and now I want MORE seasons!

Thanks",1520985600,,529,4.313131313131313
8406158,5,B003UTUYAO,"I love watching the show on the  Ion channel  68.3 out of Dallas TX , but I Can't buy the DVDs of this Wonderful show to watch.  You need to make THE LISTENER series pm DVD so people in the USA can buy them.",1501372800,,207,3.659090909090909

8406161,5,B003UTUYAO,"I bought it to get Episode 13, the end of the season cliff-hanger episode which Ion TV, for some reason, never seemed to show. This set is PAL, not Region 1, like most United States DVD players, so you need a PAL or a region-free DVD player to play it.  Episodes 1 through 13 are all in the set.",1467072000,3,295,4.0
