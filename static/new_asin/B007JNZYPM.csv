5091639,1,B007JNZYPM,"Like many fans of this series, I have been waiting twenty-five years for the commercial release of ""Rags to Riches.""  Now that this day has come, I can't help but be extremely disappointed with the way Image Entertainment haphazardly hurried this release with no concern to the quality of the product.  At the top of my list of complaints is the fact that the pilot is not the final version as it was originally broadcast.  The pilot released on this DVD is a ""rough cut"" and a ""work in progress.""  Which explains all of the film splice lines/scratches and rough audio mix. Viewers may notice that it is titled ""Rags AND Riches"" (a pre-release title which was later changed.) It is also missing the actors/producer credits at the beginning as well as the end credits. Also not included is the popular song ""School is In"" as well as most of the well remembered score and music cues (specifically at the commercial breaks).

Should buyers wish to see the finessed final pilot the way they fell in love with it originally, it was recently released correctly on the German DVD which can be purchased at amazon.de (but you will need a region free player) and the final version was also released correctly two different times on VHS.",1339027200,60,1227,4.662037037037037
5091640,5,B007JNZYPM,"This was my absolute favorite tv show as a kid, i was devastated when they took it off the air after only 2 seasons. I had taped many of them on VHS, and literally kept this old tv that had a vcr unit built in just so I could watch an episode or two every couple of years when i wanted to reminisce. I also bought a set from some guy overseas who transferred them on to dvd, the quality was horrible but at least it was something. But now we're legit! so excited to get my set. This show rocked.",1338854400,18,495,3.910891089108911
5091641,5,B007JNZYPM,"It's about time.  I saw the DVDs that a seller created, but since I was burned once by buying a set of 'Just the Ten of Us' DVDS and the quality was horrible, I am not one to make the same mistake twice.  I never thought I'd see this series on DVD -- when I was a kid, I loved the show and was disappointed when it went off the air.  I ran across one old episode on an old VHS tape, and watched it over and over until I wore the tape out.  So happy to see this coming out on DVD!",1337212800,4,479,3.621359223300971
5091642,5,B007JNZYPM,"i have waited so long to see one of my fav younger years tv shows on dvd! i'm so excited i can't wait to watch these flash backs down memory lane episodes with my daughter! the price is so reasonable, just really excited!!",1336003200,3,222,4.186046511627907
5091643,5,B007JNZYPM,"I loved this show growing up! For years I have waited for it to be released on DVD. Even considering purchasing one that a seller created. But knowing that it would have bad picture quality, sound etc I waited. I was so excited when I saw it was available for Pre Order and immediately did reserve my copy. My favorite show is Glee and this series reminds me of the beginning of musical type TV shows. I do agree with the other reviewer that bonus material would have been even better and I would have enjoyed to have it. But just to have the show on DVD period is gift enough! Thank you Amazon for finally giving this show the release it deserves!!!",1335312000,9,650,4.2926829268292686
5091644,5,B007JNZYPM,"I am so glad to see that this series from my childhood is getting an official dvd release!  FIVE STARS for getting released at all.  Who cares about bonus features. It's either this or a bootleg.  Take your pick, guys.",1333411200,9,218,4.4
5091645,4,B007JNZYPM,Loved the whole series .This was one of my favorite shows growing up.

5091664,4,B007JNZYPM,"Everything that has been said about the pilot episode quality is true.  The quality of this episode is awful.  It was definitely a rush job.  However, the regular series episodes are top quality transfers.  I bought this for my wife because she was a huge fan of the pilot when it aired on television all those years ago and she loves it.  I most certainly recommend this series to al those who love musicals and family oriented shows.

5091748,5,B007JNZYPM,"A very good older television show which I'm surprised didn't last longer. It is a great show for the family that has singing in every episode kind of like Glee. Personally, I think we need more shows like this on television today instead of all the violent and crude shows the networks seems so fond of. Not that some of those shows aren't good, but it would be nice to have some more family friendly choices to choose from. The characters are all very likeable for the most part and the acting is very well done as is the music numbers in each episode, For the price, this set feels almost like a steal.",1407196800,2,604,4.307017543859649

5091764,5,B007JNZYPM,"I watched Rags to Riches as a young girl and later would rent the movie regularly at our local Blockbuster until they stopped carrying VHS tapes.  Couldn't understand why they took the time to release the pilot on VHS, but never put a DVD together and was so excited to see this on Amazon, finally!  I read the reviews and was a little nervous about the pilot episode on the DVD, but although there are a few minor places where the screen appears to need ""tracking"" it played well.  I couldn't find any scenes cut and the episode played beautifully; which was great because I was sharing it with my 11 year old daughter.  I really wish they made more television like this today because it is so family friendly and full of great morals and values.  I still tear up everytime Mickey announces the Dynamic Delights and am so thrilled to get to share these ladies with my little ladies.",1382486400,,883,4.459627329192546

5091766,3,B007JNZYPM,I have the pilot on VCR tape. I was lucky to find it in the bargain bin back in the late 80's early 90's. I haven't watched the pilot on DVD. I figured it wasn't worth it. It's true what others have said about the quality. It is not up to todays standards. For those who had/have worn out their VCR tapes and are/were used to volume changing and colors fading that's kind of what it looks like on DVD. Sort of adds an 80's VCR Tape feel to the show only reminding me of the times I would watch my VCR tapes of this show and others to the point of the tape degrading till it snapped. I have only watched up to the las vegas trip episode. So far I am happy to relive those episodes. I knew the quality wasn't what we expect for a DVD. I am happy to be able to watch these episodes again. I am satisfied with this purchase.,1381363200,2,820,3.9457831325301207

5091770,4,B007JNZYPM,"Growing up I used to watch the VHS movie ""Rags to Riches"".  I never knew it was made into a TV show!  So, I bought the series to see if it was anything like the movie.  (I already own the movie on DVD, copied from a VHS.)  I never expected to see the movie as the pilot episode to the series.  Althought the TV series was interesting, the pilot episode has issues.  I bought this product from 3 different sources thinking I might get lucky.  Nope, all three copies, from three different sources, had the same issue.  I'm afraid no matter where you buy this product, you too will have this issue with the pilot episode, but ONLY the pilot episode.  The copy I have is so much better in picture then the copy on the series.  As I watched the pilot episode for the first time, I noticed black lines and black spots popping up constantly.  Also, the volume was a roller coater, contantly going up and down.  This one episode is just in bad shape.  The other episodes are all just fine.  Since the pilot episode was giving me this problem, I returned the item twice.  Now, I'm done; just gonna keep my movie copy so I can watch the pilot epsiode without the black lines and black spots and audio going in and out.  I've wlatched all the discs from the copy I bought from Amazon.com, no more problems.  So, if you like the TV series, I recommend getting this, but make sure you get the movie (pilot episode) seperately if you can not handle the roughness of the pictureand audio.",1375488000,20,1473,4.317518248175182

5091819,1,B007JNZYPM,"Totally amazed with today's high state of the art computers that a professional production DvD can be created with disappointing results.  The pilot movie of the DvD was full of glitches so numerous to mention.  The Dvd pilot episode in short was a transferred film captured on Dvd that includes all the specks, flashes, and lines that one would expect to see on an old 8mm film and not a movie production.  Heed the warning of others when they mention about the quality of the DvD pilot episode. On a plus note the tv series episodes were captured with better quality, but not of the quality one would expect on a Dvd.  The episode series appear soft looking and lacked a detail crisp image.  Fortunately, I have the pilot episode taped on VHS from tv way back in the day and it is of better quality than the one I just purchased.  The pilot episode deserved better restoration than what was provided (apparently none was performed at all).",1342828800,12,941,4.571428571428571
5091820,5,B007JNZYPM,"excited to receive in the mail, had the pilot episode on VHS, kids love it. This product is compact, easy to store, and to see which epidodes are where, making it easy to use. Good picture on the tv, making it a viewing pleasure. The singing throughout each episode makes it very enjoyable, and brings back memories from when the series aired. My young children enjoy singing along, and trying to do the same moves that the girls do",1341532800,,432,4.481012658227848
5091821,3,B007JNZYPM,"I've been waiting decades to finally get a decent home copy of this series. It's one of the few left that haven't seen a DVD release so when I saw this was being made, I immediately preordered the set. I'm still glad to have it, as I only had a VHS copy from TV of the pilot that was degrading fast, but am very disappointed in the content and quality.

Watching the pilot, it's filled with scratches and blobs and sometimes the sound is missing. The title is even wrong! (reading a previous review, this is a work in progress copy and not the final one). This means I still cannot get rid of my old VHS tape. I doubt that it will receive a decent release either. How hard would it have been to get the actual pilot for this set?

As someone said, there are no real extras. Two badly produced bonus trailers are the only extra content and limited to disc one only. I'm still not sure why they included them...are they coming to DVD? Are they coming to Blu-ray?

If you're a fan of this show, you'll buy it cause there isn't anything else out there, but wait for a good sale--no reason to spend anymore than needed on this poor release.",1340582400,27,1135,4.24537037037037
5091822,5,B007JNZYPM,"I was so happy when I saw this set on the shelf at a local store.  I have been reading some of the reviews on here, and I am tired of people whining about the quality of the set. Yes, the pilot was a working episode, and the sound is not superb, but all the episodes are available, and I am so happy that I don't have to watch my homemade copies anymore.  I loved this show in the 80's, and I thought, because of copyright laws, that we would never see these episodes on DVD.  If you aren't happy with the product, you don't have to buy it...but I am very pleased with the release of this series on DVD!  Thank you!!!!  If you love GLEE....get this show and introduce your children to a great series!",1339372800,3,700,4.08029197080292
