5406486,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"This is an amazing DVD.  I wish I had it when I was delivering my
4 babies. It would have been so helpful and encouraging. This guide
is visually beautiful, the information is clear, and is presented in a
professional manner. The exercises and techniques look so effective.
Neri's manner and extensive knowledge engender confidence and peace of
mind at a time when the parents-to-be so need it.

  The DVD  is divided into the different phases of labor and
delivery. Each phase has thorough explanations about what will happen
physiologically, and detailed descriptions of what to expect. Then
techniques, partner massage moves, and visualization techniques are
given to help manage each phase. I know this information could have
been useful to me in my deliveries, and wish my care providers had
known it.

  I especially like the fact that partners are given tools to help
at the delivery, since they usually tend to feel helpless in this
decidedly female environment. I know my husband would have loved to
have these techniques at his disposal when he was in the delivery room
with me.

  I will give this DVD as a baby shower gift to every expecting
mother I know from now on.",1367452800,6,1180,4.792079207920792
5406487,5,B00AAQ6VPM,What a great resource for women and their partners!  The DVD is packed with practical suggestions on making labor more efficient and comfortable along with explanations as to why these things help.  The instructor is so calm and really instills a sense of faith in women that they can have a wonderful birth experience.,1365465600,,319,4.888888888888889
5406488,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"I am so glad Neri made Practicing for an Active Birth--it was invaluable to me and to my partner in preparing for our upcoming birth.

Neri's deep understanding of and empathy for pregnant women is evident in the video she hasmade. Neri's calm confidence and gentle humor also shine through.

Her unique ability to devise action from information sets the video apart. I have researched an enormous amount around childbirth, but much of the information was either clinical or anecdotal. Her evidence-based approach connects knowledge and practice in a way that I had not seen, and which my husband and I really responded to. We respect the research and thoughtfulness that have gone into the video, and the knowledgeable and intuitive spirit that guides it.

As a mixed marriage of scientist and artist, we often have very different methods of evaluating material and approaching the learning process. We both loved this video, and used it frequently, taking one birthing stage at a time and going into depth with our understanding and the exercises she presented. We were able to discover what works well for us, and how to communicate what we needed from one another and from the rest of our childbirth team. It really helped us to get on the same page.

The language and information was clearly but not simplistically delivered, the exercises were focused and took both the woman and her partner into account, and the depth was terrific.

Although we did take a childbirth class--one that lasted eight weeks--we found nothing simplistic or redundant in the video; it was, in fact, more than a supplement. It was a way to engage at our own pace, with an expert coach on call.  I have friends who live in remote places, and I will recommend this to them as a way of discovering and understanding active birth.

Our plan is to have a relatively natural birth in a hospital setting; and Practicing for an Active Birth fits beautifully into that situation; it feels empowering without being oppositional, putting the woman's process at the center of the question, it does not leave out the role of her partner or the rest of the team: doulas, doctors and nurses.

Neri's perspective truly embraces childbirth as an active and healthy process.

I am due any day now, with a little girl, and I feel calm, confident and well practiced with my partner, due in large part to this video. Thank you for making this transformative experience one that I look forward to and embrace.",1365465600,5,2470,4.82033096926714
5406489,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"Neri is very knowledgeable and experienced in all things related to birth. She is passionate
about helping women have an empowering experience when birthing their babies.
It shows. This DVD will help expectant moms and dads practice and prepare
for the birth experience. This is hands on, not some lecture, and if you do what
Neri shows, you will be prepared, no doubt.",1362528000,,369,4.873015873015873
5406490,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"This DVD is fantastic for couples who are about to embark on the journey of labor. Neri Choma's amazing skills at teaching this hands on way of active birthing, really helps women and labor coaches to become well practiced at this art and gain good experiences at the fundamentals of childbirth without interventions. Highly recommended for couples, family or friends who wish to help in labor and doulas alike. Great Job Neri. http://www.amazon.com/Practicing-Active-Comprehensive-Hands--Healthy/dp/B00AAQ6VPM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1361232667&sr=8-2&keywords=active+birth+dvd",1362182400,,577,6.917808219178082

Well done Neri!  Thank you for such a wonderful resource!",1362009600,,419,4.805555555555555
5406492,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"I didn't know a lot before watching this DVD and in only few hours I feel like I learned a lot and would know what to do when the time is right.
Neri is obviously very knowledgable about the birth process and I loved it that she separated the process to stages and gave different tools for dealing with every stage, both for mommy and daddy. Most importantly, with a DVD, I can watch it as much as I need and when I want.  Also, it is less embarrassing to practice all of those very creative positions privately. To sum up, this is a great, highly recommended DVD that will prepare you to the birth of you child. It will definitely help you understand the process, keep you in control, which is important for a safe, fast and empowering delivery.",1361923200,,746,4.328571428571428
5406493,3,B00AAQ6VPM,Helpful video... a bit cheesey!  I thought the price was very high though for what you get.  If I would have known how little I was going to get for my money I probably would have chose differently.  Think it's worth half that price.,1361318400,,233,4.25
5406494,5,B00AAQ6VPM,This DVD has lots of great information & labor support tools for an empowered birth.  Neri Choma has a very soothing voice and gives clear instructions on different things to try.  Her explanation of the different birth stages and possible positions to try is going to be invaluable to me in my Doula labor coaching.,1355270400,,316,4.7272727272727275
5406495,5,B00AAQ6VPM,This is an excellent video. The DVD has a section specifically for each stage of labor. Each stage is explained and then reviews different techniques such as positions and breathing. My only suggestion would be for handout materials that review the different labor positions and tips mentioned in the DVD. I feel this would be beneficial in practicing and give us something to reference once labor begins.,1464825600,,405,5.059701492537314
5406496,2,B00AAQ6VPM,Video was ok. If you absolutely have no ability to get to a birth class or read about active/ natural birth methods then get it. I think it was way overpriced and the ladies voice wasn't relaxing and soothing to me. There was also one guy in the video ( a participant in the class) who was obviously so uncomfortable with relaxation and being taped so it kinda ruined the tone too. The point of these types of videos is for me to be supported and positive  so I can have a natural birth. Having a guy like that made it the opposite. Read Ina May Gaskins book instead.,1459728000,,567,4.201834862385321
5406497,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"The techniques in this video really work! My doula suggested I get this dvd so that my husband and I could practice for our first birth at home. We watched the dvd together to learn about the stages of labor and birth, and practiced the positions, massage and movements along with the video. It was a great supplement to the birth class, and really could have been used in place of the birth class. When my water broke, we let the doula know and started the movements and positions from the dvd.  I used the stage 1 techniques while getting ready and waiting for my husband to get home. When I arrived at the hospital I was already 5 cm dilated.  My doula asked why I didn't ask her to come sooner. My answer? I didn't realize I was that far along in my labor because I wasn't in immense pain.  I used the movements from this video to cope right into active labor. We moved right into the next stage of motions from the dvd continued using it's suggested activities through the birth. I had a fantastic natural labor with no pain medication!  My family and I are big fans of this video. :)",1457049600,14,1089,4.297560975609756
5406498,3,B00AAQ6VPM,"This would be great for first time parents who don't want to spring for classes. As a second time mom, I couldn't get through it without giggling hysterically. My husband and I spent most of our time making fun of one of the men in the class.",1455667200,,242,4.170212765957447

The videos were well put-together and the instructor provided clear instructions in a number of techniques for both expectant mothers as well as partners.  With 2.5 hours of content, we were both very pleased with the breadth of techniques taught and the opportunities to practice them.

For anyone looking to learn a number of very helpful methods to handle the rigors of labor and avoid potentially-unnecessary medical and/or surgical interventions during childbirth, this disc is an excellent resource.",1439683200,2,643,5.284313725490196

5406501,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"I am a birth professional and I find this DVD very useful for the expecting parents who want to prepare for a natural childbirth or at least want to educate themselves about childbirth.
All the phases of labor are explained in detail which can certainly help you feel more in control because you know what to expect. Lots and lots of labor comfort measure techniques to choose from (and to practice!!!!). If your partner wants to participate he/she can find plenty of massage techniques for you to practice together for the big day. The relaxation can come in very handy during pregnancy and during labor as well.

5406503,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"We have been using the DVD to prepare for the birth of our first baby daughter for the last few weeks. It has been really great to be able to listen to Neris clear and extensive explanations about all the stages of labor.
We also went to a child birth preparation class that was really good, but we feel that the DVD provides additional information about important comfort measures that can be used throughout the various stages of labor, and also provides useful information for the partner or support person about how to be an integral part of labor. The DVD covers background knowledge, breathing techniques, massage techniques, positions, visualizations and relaxation.

Having the DVD is really nice because you can watch it at your own pace, maybe 30 min. every day, stop and rewind and really practice all the useful advice that is there until it is absorbed.
Neri is a really great instructor and she compiled a DVD that is both informative and practical, and we have been watching it a few times a week and feel that it has really helped us prepare for labor. We highly recommend it to anyone preparing for childbirth.

Update: I am now in my second pregnancy and the first thing that came to my mind is this Neri and this DVD. After the successful childbirth I had with the previous one, I really think this DVD can remind me all the great and useful methods that helped me go through and manage the the contractions and delivery!",1427155200,,1440,4.62109375

5406505,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"This video is a great resource as preparation for birth. You wouldn't run a marathon without prior training. Why would you try to go through childbirth without training?
This video has all sorts of positions and imagery that you can use in each stage of labor. It will give you and your partner the peace of mind to know and have practiced all sorts of positions and tricks, so that when labor gets difficult you will have plenty of resources!
Neri Choma followed up with me immediately when my DVD wouldn't play the first time. She was very helpful in offering me extra resources and making sure I got a dvd that worked!",1424736000,,621,4.504424778761062

It was really important for us to have a natural and unmediated birth, and the title of the DVD sounded very promising. The DVD was everything we hoped it would be. We enjoyed practicing the different positions, massages, and breathing. The techniques were presented in a very clear and structured manner that was easy to follow, and we even used it during the birth while we were still at home. Following the DVD during our birth made us very confident and comfortable to stay at home before heading over to the hospital. I highly recommend!",1424476800,,608,4.587155963302752
5406507,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"I love this DVD for so many reasons chief among them is the clarity and structure in which the material is presented.  I am a labor and delivery nurse and I teach childbirth classes and this DVD is a great tool e i use to enhance my classes  The couples I teach find the DVD very helpful when practicing for active birth.  The format of the DVD is in a way that allows you to practice for each phase of labor.  It allows you to stop, restart and repeat whatever area they need more practice on.  The material is presented in concise and clear manner and the different movements are clearly explained.  I have used many of these techniques in my own practice in the labor and delivery floor with great success and with increased satisfactions among my patients.
I cannot recommend this DVD enough.  I truly believe it will enhance your birthing experience by adding so many tools for  you to use during labor. In 24 years of being a nurse, I have seen many laboring women.  Some desire epidural, some desire a non-medicated delivery.  This DVD can help you achieve the birth you desire. It will simply give you the tools you need to create the birth you want.

I don't know if it was the DVD, or the tiredness from pregnancy but every time my husband and I would put the DVD in, I would fall asleep.  I never ended up watching the whole thing.  From what I do remember about the contents, if you can stay awake and watch all of it, I'm sure it would be beneficial as a brush up or supplement to a class.  I don't know if I would use it to substitute attending a class, especially for first time parents.

Lots of techniques for getting through the pain of labor I just didn't end up using any of them because my pain wasn't that bad and by pushing time I had an epidural.

5406511,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"(Note: This review was written by my wife)
Thank you Neri for creating such a wonderful DVD for all the expectant moms. Consolidated Information like this is very hard to find in one place. Me and my husband watched the DVD and absolutely loved it! This is something I would be using soon during my labor and childbirth in next few weeks.

Neri's deep understanding about a child birth is evident from the material she has provided in her DVD for expectant parents.

And, The best part about the DVD is that it talks about each phase of labor including what to expect, techniques, positions and massages to use. Very handy for mother and the birth partner as they can just follow the instructions without getting panicked.

I wish I had found your DVD during my first child birth but I would definitely recommend this DVD to all the expectant moms now.",1413244800,,852,4.592105263157895

We did a labour preparation courses before the first baby and this DVD helped refreshing our memory.

The practices gave us some new techniques to help with labour.

The video is organized well by the stages of labour and coping techniques for each stage.

5406514,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"We have got the DVD a few month before our second baby was due. It helped to refresh our memory on birth process. Our older son is 8 now, so it was a while back! :) The technics described and shown work really well and Neri (the trainer) explains everything in a way that is easy to comprehend. Later, during labor we had moments of ""... oh! that's exactly as it was described by Neri... we should try this technic or breathing now..""

The only trick is, that you actually have to watch that DVD and it's best if you do it at least twice with some interval in between.
Pick a weekend morning, dedicate 2hrs of time and just watch it. Turn off your phones, facebooks and everything else that can distract...
Sounds too hard?? :) It's much easier to do it that way than sit through two 4 hour classes after you had a long day at work :)

 Me and my husband watched it ones together learning how he can help me and generally what to expect when the contractions starts (in the first time it start when my water just broke down).
In 37 + 4 week I woke up in the middle of the night from a dream that I have contractions just to find out I really have them. Since it was really weak I didn't even woke my husband  up and I decide I will try to stay home, send my boy to his daycare and just then go to the hospital.
I played this DVD again for myself, stopped it for each contraction to follow the movements suggested by Neri feeling really relaxed and confident. I finely woke my husband up around 5:30, kept doing the movement (and hide from my son while doing them so he want be afraid) when we finely got to the hospital it was already 5 cm open and after a hour and a half without any pain killers my beautiful baby girl was out. I wish I had a chance to watch this DVD before my first delivery, I think it might turn out to be a better experience.

8549278,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"This DVD was just perfect for me! I used this along with a pregnancy yoga DVD instead of a class to prepare for delivering my first child. I was able to have my daughter through the natural birth process without a doula. As some reviewers noted, the video is a little dated. However, I focused on the content and was well prepared for my labor and the delivery. This video does a great job with explaining labor and delivery concepts and terms.",1481587200,,444,4.426829268292683
8549279,5,B00AAQ6VPM,"Three months ago I gave an active and natural birth to my second son and it was a wonderful experience mostly thanks to this video. My husband and I were looking for guidance and information on what to expect without having to spend a lot of time on actually going to seminars or reading books and this video certainly answered our needs.
In the video we found a focused but informative explanation of the different phases of the entire labor and birth processes and it really helped me during labor to identify what phase Im at and what to expect next without the need to get the nurses or medical staff involved. The video was extremely helpful by providing an array of technics to cope with the pain that is unique to each phase by suggesting different body positions that both me and my husband practiced during the labor.
Very recommended for anyone who is considering an active birth!",1464998400,,890,4.60377358490566
