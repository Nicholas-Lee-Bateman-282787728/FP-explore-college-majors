8719298,5,B00YWCFFKM,"How wonderful that this documentary captures the heart, soul, lives, memories and words of these remarkable women.  The combination of historical footage (both stills and video) interspersed with such honest up-close-and-personal interviews makes it move along quickly.  I learned a lot - especially the early parts about so many workers arriving in California but with no place to live! These women are my heroes...they paved the way for the next generation of women to do more and be more than before.  Their distinct personalities came through vividly without getting hung up with the emotional pitfall of WWII.  Kenneth Stewart has done it all and done it well with this  well-paced, fine-tuned clear and honest tribute to the Richmond Rosies.",1527724800,,747,5.243697478991597
8719299,5,B00YWCFFKM,"You can feel the rapport Ken Stewart had with these extraordinary gals as he interviewed them. The result is that the force of each personality is distinct, their recollections so clear-headed, and all of them so engaged. The fearless closeups of their faces, their hair and makeup tell about the courageous way they take on extreme old age. These women seem to have a mysterious something ""extra."" Either they have ""it"" because they worked in the shipyards, or they worked in the shipyards because they have ""it."" But they're all exceptional.

The interviews are interspersed with priceless historical pics and footage--thousands of people at work building ships, along with staggering numbers up on the screen of how many ships (and planes!) got built and how fast. Loved the parts where the women describe the living arrangements, the personal stuff, the rigor of learning how to weld, the tests they had to take, the dangers of the job. The industriousness of that era retooled the country, and we're still running on the fumes of that today. Stewart's film carries us directly back to that extraordinary time.",1522368000,,1114,5.021621621621621
8719300,5,B00YWCFFKM,"I highly recommend ""The Richmond Rosies"" - which tells the story of the ""Rosie the Riveters"" who built WWII war ships in Northern California. In this documentary we meet five of the ""women who built the ships."" They are still as energetic and vibrant as they were in the 1940s. It's great to see these women finally get the credit they are due. A must see! Five stars!",1467158400,2,368,4.426470588235294
8719301,5,B00YWCFFKM,"These brave Rosie-the-Riveters, are America's first Women's libbers, that took on jobs traditionally held by men.  I feel inspired by their personal stories... thank you for creating this documentary!
The historic footage and information, took me on a journey that explored a past when we worked together as one, and American pride reigned supreme.
I love this film...  it brought tears to my eyes and gave me the chills!",1465171200,,421,5.086956521739131
8719302,5,B00YWCFFKM,"This is a Great documentary! It has original Rosie's with their narrative and thoughts on welding ships our troops went off to fight on in WWII.
Lots and lots of historic footage and that is why I enjoy documentaries like these. Very interesting!",1463529600,3,246,4.744186046511628
8719303,5,B00YWCFFKM,"My first day of work as an electrician, I worked in a nursing home in Antioch, CA. One of the residents mentioned that her sister was a Rosie. I decided to check out this film on iTunes. I am working in a field that is now about 6% women. I have no desire to work another day as a secretary. I am grateful to the women who made my career choice that less shocking to the rest of the world",1462492800,2,388,3.8625
8719304,5,B00YWCFFKM,"I happen to be related to one of the women in this movie and another Rosie who passed last year. The creator of this movie did a wonderful job compiling disparate materials into a loving, moving whole. From the stories I have been told by my two Rosies, this movie accurately portrays that period of time and the experiences of the Rosies and those involved with them. Deep respect, admiration, and affection for these amazing women comes through in the movie, and it is a true pleasure to watch. It is suitable for the whole family and would be great for classroom use. I highly recommend this gem.",1439078400,5,599,4.555555555555555
