1259284,3,B000038I11,"Joe the King is a tale of a young lad virtually abandoned by society and family.  The father (Val Kilmer) is an abusive, alcoholic; the mother is a passive female who allows the abuse.  In essence, she has given up.  The  older brother is in the same mess.  All he has going for him is the fact  that he is a year older, and is, perhaps, more attractive.  Joe, for the  most part, seems more like a little hobo (or to some, perhaps, a modern  Artful Dodger).
This movie will carry you through many emotions, and most  will be painful...even down right depressing.  Fleiss plays his part  perfectly.  His facial expressions and body language can make you laugh in  one moment; make you want to cry in the next.
The opening scene was  difficult for me.  A younger Joe has his pants pulled down and is paddled  by his antagonistic teacher.  I don't think this would have really happened  during the time frame of this movie, but I did flash back to the many times  I had to hold my hand out for a swat with a wooden ruler.
While Joe tries  to work at a legitimate job, he finds it ever too tempting to start  stealing.  Joe is going to pay off his alcoholic father's debt and replace  his mother's record collection; it was destroyed by the father during a  drunken rage.  Joe never uses the money for his own gain.
You will find  yourself 'rootin' for Joe.  You don't want him to get caught.  But a  meddling school counselor (Hawke) upsets the scheme, ultimately leading to  the arrest and conviction of Joe.  The counselor thinks he is helping.  HA!
Prior to Joe's departure to the juvenile facility, the father  delivers a rather touching dialog.  But, too little, too late.
Many  people may find this movie too much of a downer.  You want a happy ending;  it is not there.
If you are a male 25 or older, and if you had an  abusive, alcoholic father...if you were ever tempted to steal  something...if your boyhood days were tough and you lived on the edge of  what could have been 'normal' but was in fact hell...if you've loved and  lost, then you will probably enjoy this movie.  I think it's a great movie,  but then, again, I could see a lot of myself in Joe; I just never got  caught.  I recommend the DVD version, simply for the exceptional narrative.",959126400,25,2259,4.4
1259285,5,B000038I11,"This is a vulgar, profane, painful movie about a vulgar, profane, and painful young life that, at 14, appears already to be wasted.  The boy, ""Joe the King,"" never had a chance.  In the most dysfunctional of  homes, where he is cursed by both slovenly mother and drunken father, in a  school where he suffers severe emotional abuse (not to mention a pants-down  whipping in front of the class) at the hands of a fat, ugly teacher, and  onto the streets, where alienation and theft become a way of life: that is  young Joe's milieu.  And friends, it isn't pretty.  Neither is the movie.  Poignant?  Yes, absolutely.  But pretty?  No chance.  And that is exactly  the hand that fate has dealt to young Joseph:  no chance.
The cinematic  beauty of Joe the King-easily the most moving motion picture that I have  seen in many years-is the dose of gut-wrenching reality that it dishes up .  . . and keeps dishing all the way to the end.  And then some.  Because it  doesn't just go away after the credits.  It stays there in your conscience  to haunt you.  There is no saving grace in store for that boy.  No one  steps forward to save him from the sordid future that appears to be in  store for him.  No redemption.  No touch by an angel to rescue this  soon-to-be-lost soul.  His no-good father (well-played by Val Kilmer) is  moved almost to tears, but too late . . . way too late.
You like irony?  Joe ends up before a juvenile judge after being caught for burglary and  theft.  And what has he done with the ill-gotten gains?  He paid off a  pressing debt for his father, and replaced his mother's precious record  collection destroyed by his father in a drunken rage.  Admirably, the  movie-makers don't hit you over the head or moralize about any of that,  they merely show it, period.
I shall not soon forget the bitter final  scene as Joe is led down the long, long hallway to begin serving the  kid's-prison sentence handed down by the judge.  The boy stops, turns and  stares you straight in the eye.  Then in heart-rending closeup he continues  the wordless stare.  At you.  At me.  At all of us who failed him.
And it  hurts.  It truly hurts.",958521600,9,2150,4.44935064935065
1259286,4,B000038I11,"This movie is a great independent feature.  The cast is outstanding, including the young star.  The movie follows a young boy through an abusive father and tough neighboorhood.  The DVD contains a insightfull  commentary on getting the movie made and also good independent tips.  It  also analyzes what I consider the best scene in the movie.",951091200,5,342,5.017857142857143

1259347,5,B000038I11,"While not the type of movie for everyone, I think this movie is perfect for anyone who cares about the welfare of young people and wish to really get into the mindset of troubled youth and more easily understand them.  Kids that behave badly are not truly at heart 'bad' kids. They just have often not received the level of care and guidance to steer them on the right path. While quite melancholy and depressing through much of the film, there are also brief moments of humor as well as a spark or two of hope towards the end.  Joe has a lot of family issues throughout the movie and many of his misdeeds come about through his desire to provide for himself and members of his family.  A conversation between Joe and his previously abusive father towards the end is raw and moving as they both attempt to find a way to connect and communicate to one another their true feelings. It's this conversation that will hopefully get Joe headed on the right track even as he continues to deal with difficult circumstances.  Unfortunately, the experiences of Joe are common for a lot of less fortunate kids out there and it really takes a community of support and caring to help them turn their lives around",1421539200,,1199,4.511520737327189
1259348,5,B000038I11,"If you are studying social work, criminal justice, sociology, psychology or just interested in how certain life circumstances shape a young boy, watch Joe The King. It is not an urban setting. It is not Chicago, New York City, or Los Angeles. It is a small town and there is a young man who is shaped by family life that lead to ultimate consequences. Who is responsible? Watch it, buy it.",1402876800,,389,4.492957746478873
1259349,5,B000038I11,"Joe is an emotionally (and occasionally physically) abused child, and not just by his parents. The movie opens with Joe in elementary school (probably third or forth grade) with his teacher embarrassing him three times in a very short time frame. The third embarrassment is when she pulls his pants down in front of the whole class and spanks him on his bare bottom. The movie audience only sees his bare bottom for about a second while he is laying across her lap, but under the scenario the whole class (boys and girls) would have seen everything.
  Shortly thereafter the movie jumps ahead five years and Joe is now fourteen. He works as a dishwasher at a bar and restaurant in the evenings where he eats leftover food off the plates brought in from the customers. He is often late for school and he is also a thief, stealing food from the restaurant and from a grocery store. He also steals items from parked cars and basically anywhere else if the opportunity arises. In addition to his generally bad situation described above, Joe's father owes money to a lot of people, and they are constantly confronting Joe about this.
  Joe has only one or two friends, and they are not very good friends at that. Joe has a brother who is a year older than him who is there for him (if the older brother's friends are not around) during the first of the movie, but even he gets mad at Joe eventually and does not want to talk to him. Joe is sent to the school counselor because of his constantly being late for school, and the school counselor does finally show some interest in helping Joe, but his attempt to help is too little too late, and in a way backfires.
  Noah Fleiss (the star of the movie regardless of what the above credits say) nails the part of Joe. You can not help but feel sorry for him as you watch him spiral downward in the path his life seems destine for.
  The ""R rating"" is probably due to the large amount of profanity used in the film. The children use profanity, the parents use profanity, the people Joe works with use profanity, the children and parents use profanity talking with each other and even the school counselor uses profanity at least once. The only sexual content in the movie is one of Joe's adult coworkers in the bar and restaurant who tells Joe about his sex life and the only nudity is the brief shot of Joe being spanked bare bottom.",1397952000,,2375,4.44367816091954

1259352,1,B000038I11,"Even though this movie stars Val Kilmer and is very sad, it is not worth buying. It is poorly made. What a waste of money. Read a book. Don't watch this movie.",1386720000,,159,4.0
1259353,5,B000038I11,"This is a slice-of-life no holds barred movie about 14 year old Joe Henry growing up in a dysfunctional family in the 70s. I can kind of relate since I grew up in a dysfunctional family in the 70s as well. We weren't this dysfunctional, though.
This kid does not get any breaks. Sooner or later he seems to be set upon by just about everyone in his life, even if it was un-intentional. His dad, Bob, is a former school janitor who could not hold his job due to excessive drinking. Every time we see Bob he is in some stage of inebriation; either drunk, hung-over, or in the process of getting drunk again. His mom, Theresa, is a shattered woman who between work and avoiding Bobs wrath seems not to have the time or inclination to look after her two adolescent boys. His brother, Mike, is one year older and in the same situation. Mike is trying desperately to get in with kids from better families to hopefully eventually have a chance at a better life for himself. Who could blame him?? Both Mike and Joe work after school, Mike as a school janitor and Joe as a dishwasher in a diner, to compensate for Bob not working.
Joe tries desperately to hold his family together. He steals valuables and money to try and pay off the people Bob owes money to. He also replaces Theresas treasured collection of Blues LPs that Bob destroyed in a fit of rage. He is unintentionally turned in by an incompetent guidance counselor who thought he was helping. Joe is arrested and slapped with a 6-12 month sentence in a juvenile detention center.
It isn't until an hour before he has to leave for jail that Bob finally sees the error in his ways that caused this all to happen to his son. After Joe leaves on the prison bus, his mother finds the big box of LPs that he bought for her.
Its a very sad movie and the last 10 minutes and especially the last 5 minutes make this the saddest movie Ive ever seen. It might be because this is usually not the kind of movie I watch but many others seem to feel the same about this movie. I will say that this movie, is not real long on dialog because people, especially in families like that (trust me on this) don't talk to each other a lot. You have to get a lot of the story from the mood, the setting and cinematography, and expressions of the characters. This is one of the things that makes Joe the King stand out for me, it doesn't inundate the viewer in unrealistic dialog in order to narrate everything to us.

Superb acting and filming in every respect despite one or two slightly hazy spots and abrupt transitions. Particularly commendable performances by Peter Tambakis and Noah Fleiss as, respectively, Joe at about 9 and Joe at 14.

This film captures the cycle of abuse and oppression within a troubled, fragmented family better than any that I've seen. The simple, dead-on dialogue does a great deal thematically speaking. In the words of Joe's older brother, Mike (again, well-played by Rob Bergenstock/Max Ligosh): ""People are so f*d up!""

Somewhat linear, slice-of-life plot that is not focused on any one dramatic event. Nonetheless, there is plenty in the way of tension and surprise here. This is the sort of film that makes you forget you are watching a film.",1357862400,,857,5.158273381294964

Frank Whaley's ""Joe The King"" has been called by the filmmaker himself ""semi-autobiographical."" And such a story about so much pain and misery just makes to almost want to see it just to see how thie guy got where he is today.

It so damn downbeat, you have to ask yourself, ""How does all this turn out? This poor little guy... Is there a happy ending?""

Like a lot of actor-helmed vehicles, this one is loaded with big name walk-ons. They work, but at the same time, they disapoint. None of the supporting/bit characters are on the screen enough to make enough of an impact.

""Joe The King"" is chock-full of trite and truths to life--the lead that seems to be born into the hard-luck life, the abusive, alcoholic loser father, the weak-willed, weak-spirited, whimpering mother who doesn't care if her husband pounds on her kids as long as he doesn't pound on her, the guidance counselor who's all thumbs--aren't they all? Not just a cliche' in movies, but what guidance counselor has ever been worth in damn in life? Was yours?

There is a moment where it is ""Careers Day"" in an elementry class where it is revealed that Joe's dad is the janitor. He is ridiculed an lashes out (very mildly) at an obnoxious litle teacher's pet and the Dickensian teacher drags Joe and spanks him in front of the entire class. The knife is further pushed and twisted when she makes the whole thing personal by muttering angrily so he can hear, ""Just like your father...""

Whaley is clearly dealing with old wounds and knows how to use them so they feel fresh and make you cringe (or worse, relate).

The movie is full of downbeat moments and times where life shows it's ugly face. It seems as if God is very skillfully finding ways to torture Joe... and then skewering it further in smaller ways. In a moment of desperation, Joe attempts to do what his parents can't seem to... save the day.

Joe is not only starving, he descends into petty theft. Then takes it even further. He attempts to dodge his father's outbursts and reach out to his brother, who is trying to eke his way into the ""in-crowd"" and doesn't want Joe's jinx streak to rub off on him, even to the point of at one point getting out of bed and going to go sleep the closet to get away from his brother's sad vibes.

But ""Joe The King"" is not just one long crying jag. There is humor, sweetness and tenderness. People may differ about the nature of the ending, but in the strangest, saddest way, it offers some hope.

The children swear in the tradition of ""Stand By Me,"" the child-abuse or disregard in the tradition of ""Radio Flyer"" and the atmosphere is reminsent of many other films about working-class life. Unlike ""That '70's Show"" or ""Detroit Rock City"" or ""Dick,"" this movie doesn't feel like it belongs solely in the era.

It takes place in the 1970's to be sure, but a story like this feels timeless.

Lead actor/title character Noah Fleiss gives on the the best performances he's probably ever given, although how many movies has he really made? And how many of them really have allowed him to shine? This is definately the one.

Val Kilmer gives a just plain awesome turn as Bob, Joe's stinking, deadbeat drunk of a dad who's one of the biggest problems in Joe's life. He owes money to more than half the town. He dodges his creditors like bullets, drinks himself into a pathetic stupor and lashes out monstrously at his family.

Kilmer, known for playing dazzling roles and pretty-boy parts, puts on a great deal of weight and shows nastier edges that he has since ""The Doors.""

Since writer/director Whaley and Kilmer first worked together in that film, Whaley obviously saw how powerfully Kilmer could play a violent sadist, always under the influence of drugs. Kilmer has had trouble getting working because he's so damn dificult to work with, so the two were clearly doing each other favors. Another pal of Whaley's, Ethan Hawke plays a friendly, but utterly useless guidance counselor who hopes to get Joe out of his slump at school. And because it's Joe, he makes things a lot worse.

Karen Young is adequate in a brief supporting part as Joe's mother. And hispanic wunderkind John Leguizamo, a natural comedic talent, takes a more dramatic turn here as a flamboyant busboy in an extended cameo at the local rathole diner where Joe is working illegally. When the s--t hits the fan and Joe is at the center of it, it doesn't really come as a surprise that he's the only one who knew all along.

Whaley seems to capture the flavor for this kind of working class life and he seems to bring out the best in child actors, as well as his more distinguished adult friends and peers. He also sends us back to the era without hitting us hard with period music on the soundtrack from the day.

I myself was kind of surprised that this screenplay won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award (along with Audrey Well's ""Guinevere""). The Open Palm nomination for the film itself, that, I can see. The dialouge is altogether realistic, without being nessicarily sharp or too memorable. And the characters are believable without being too fresh.

Writer/director Whaley does an effective job of capturing the atmosphere of this Upstate New York working-class life and bring out the best in child actors and his big-name celebrity walk-throughs.

Whaley has said that much of the story is inspired by the childhood of himself and his older brother, Robert Whaley, who is featured on the soundtrack and has a bit part.

Good ol' Frank himself also has a directors cameo walk-on as one of many who the deadbeat Bob owes money to. He makes a personal house call, and he seems madder than the others Bob owes money to. He acts as a professional collector--the leg-breaking kind. He seems ready to kill Bob and after it's over, the sins of the father are, once again, visited on the son.

So this is the Whaley E! True Hollywood story. More or less.

There is a painful sadness that runs all throughout ""Joe The King,"" and when you look at Frank Whaley, the roles he's taking on and heard him just talk as himself, you kind of see there's something here that Whaley has in him which he brings to his roles.

Whaley deserves extra kudos for getting as far as he did after being dealt such a bad hand. A backhand, even. What of Joe? What of his friends, family, enemies, acquaintences? If you drink in this one, you can't help but wonder...

""Joe The King"" doesn't break any new ground whatsoever. But this is a slice-of-life film, and while technology, trends, art, ideas and ideals are constantly changing, some things remain trite and true no matter what era or part of the universe you're living in. Whaley chooses some appropriate music for his movie and some nice visuals.

""Joe The King"" is kind of an acquired taste, like many coming-of-age stories. It's more of a confessional than anything else. If you've lived a life somewhat like this, or in this part of the world or in this enviorment remotely, you'll understand...

1259363,5,B000038I11,"I LOVE this film to pieces!!  I've watched it over and over and am so grateful that there is a commentary track.  It's one of my favorite films in the world- haunting, strong, sincere performances by each of the children and adults in this movie.  It really stayed with me the first time I saw it a few years ago- each time I see it I keep discovering all of these wonderful, subtle little things that Karen Young (my GOD!), Noah Fleiss, Max Ligosh, Val Kilmer, and everyone else does that I've missed- brilliant, overwhelmingly beautiful score thoughtfully placed through out.  Lovely cinematography and lighting- just a pleasure to watch on all levels, really.  And thank GOD for the writing- it's so realistic and not at all showy or false like 99.9% of film writing IS- that it goes entirely unnoticed and underappreciated until you actually take the time to remember that it all has actually been WRITTEN several viewings later.  So much of why I like this film I don't know that there are even words for.",1189123200,,1010,4.646067415730337
1259381,5,B000038I11,"This is one of those little movies that probably had a limited release and was probably seen mostly by people who frequent film festivals. It is a real find because if you watch it, your immediate conclusion will be: an excellent piece of cinema. The film's message is your a product of your environment and background. Joe is not a great kid but your sympathy will lie with him by the end of this film. The question you will ask is does this boy have a chance in life with the deck of cards he has been dealt with. My question is why is Frank Whalley not making any more films? Val Kilmer has never been better but most people probably don't even know he made this little gem. I thought it was competently and fluidly directed, written and acted. Its a low budget roots are evident but that actually adds to its appeal because its a film about real people in realistc situations. It is the type of film that is made in Europe. This film has a lot of merit and needs to be seen and appreciated.",1172275200,2,994,4.264550264550264
1259382,5,B000038I11,"I work with kids who come from similiar backgrounds.  This film is right on.  The actors gave award winning performances, the story is heart wrenching and very believable.  If you are a Val Kilmer fan, you'll love his supporting role!",1122940800,2,234,4.8
1259383,3,B000038I11,"This interesting independent movie directed by Frank Whalley is a worthwile and engaging coming of age story about Joe, a teenage boy (played by the unknown and excellent Noah Fleiss), who doesn`t seem to find his place in school, neighborhood and family. It doesn`t help that he has an abusive drunk father and a mother too busy to care, who let him constantly on his own and forcing him to make some (bad) choices.
This could have turned into a predictable, by-the-numbers tearjerker but thankfully the director tries to develop a deep and dry story, realistic and honest enough. The last scenes with Joe and his father are actually quite well-done, never becoming too sappy although they make for some moving and powerful moments.
Not a stellar picture, but it`s done with care and talent in all levels, turning it into an above average effort and a good directing debut for Whalley. There`s even some acting contributions by indie-stars like Ethan Hawke, John Leguizamo or Val Kilmer in supporting roles. Recommended.",1076371200,5,1021,4.976608187134503
1259384,5,B000038I11,"this movie was wonderful, NOAH FLEISS ,whom i never heard of before, was perfectly cast in this film about a boy who has nothing but himself. well thats not entirely accurate, he lives with his mom,dad and older brother, but no-one realy knows he is there. the family has nothing, Joe's father (val kilmer) is an abusive drunk who used to be the school janitor, and Joe was embarased by his job, his mom is to busy to even care about Joe, and his older brother just doesnt want him hanging around him. so what is a guy to do, in this case Joe desides that stealing is his answer, he is not a bad kid, he just does bad things and has no role model to keep him straight.
this was actor Frank Whalley's directorial debut, which he also wrote. supposed to be semi auto-biographical.
i was so impressed with this movie that i went out and bought it. and i want to find out all i can about Noah Fleiss (a definite star of the future) who plays the part perfectly.
the critics didn't like the movie too well, but it did win awards at the sundance film festival, so it cant be that bad.
near the end of the film, something happens that makes you stop and pay attention, and look at your own life, because sometimes you only get one chance.",1042675200,12,1231,4.242553191489361
1259385,5,B000038I11,"Remember this name: Noah Fleiss.  This young kid gives such a mesmerizing, true-to-life performance you almost forget you're watching a movie and become totally engrossed in the life of this kid, who is at the center of this movie.  This kid lives the most dismal, sad life and does not complain once to anyone.  He just tries to live day by day and get through his meager existence by claiming little ""victories"" where he can.  You just can't help but really feel for this kid down to the core of your being.  A must see!  Good performances from the supporting cast round out the movie as well.",1026950400,9,595,4.514018691588785
1259386,5,B000038I11,"Joe the King was a film I rented out of curiosity. I have always admired Val Kilmer's less mainstream film performances. "" HBO's ""The Man Who Broke 1000 Chains"" stands out in my mind. This film took me by surprise as much as it stunned me on a personal and intellectual level. I found that the character development was full. It was a realistic portrayal of one the most common and often covered up either seperate or combined social issues, Abuse, and Alcoholism. Plus, everything that can snowball when these subjects become a reality in a families life.
 I felt that though perhaps not a critical success on many accounts. The actors deserved acknowledgment for their near perfect portrayals. The screenplay was excellent and it was a film that touched on topics that are often misunderstood.
For those reasons alone, I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is excellent! I own many movies but, I could not add this one to my collection quick enough.",1015545600,8,954,4.781818181818182
1259387,3,B000038I11,"""Joe the King"" is a depressing story about a boy who grows up in a poor family. Joe goes to a local school where most of his classmates make fun of him because his dad is the school janitor. Joe stands up for himself, his brother, his mother, and even his dad even though they all treat him 'average'. In the end, Joe turns to crime to help his family.
""Joe the King"" is not a movie for everyone. Some viewers may find the movie depressing, disturbing and even offensive. There is a substantial amount of profanity in the movie.  If you insist on viewing it, be sure to rent it first.",986774400,,584,4.214285714285714
1259388,5,B000038I11,"This video presents the viewer with the life of too many kids in America today. Joe has many barriers and he copes as well as he can as a child.  Although the adults in his life fail to support and nourish his spirit,  Joe's sterling charcter and creativity are clear throughout the story.  As  a vice president of Reclaiming Youth International, I can say that Joe is  one my favorite kids since he is so creative and energetic as a kid.",967680000,2,438,4.3580246913580245
1259389,5,B000038I11,"This is a sad, sad, story. It is about a boy, who at 14, his life is already shown to go nowhere. The irony in the movie is that no one can save him, no matter how much they try. It seems his fate is all ready decided.  The boy makes a few bad decisions and it seems to show that he'll stay on  that same path forever. Whaley does a wonderful job with this movie. It's  not a story about the kid(Joe) but a story of many real-life children in  the same situation. We see the story through the eyes of Joe(played very  well by Noah Fleiss)as he navigatesthrough every day life. The boy has no  role model, and his family is the one to blame. His constantly drunk and  abusive father(Val Kilmer in perhaps his most touching role ever)offers no  support. Neither does his mother, who seems to be in a never-ending state  of shock. And then there's his older brother, who constantly ditches him.  We have sympathy for Joe because he's not a bad kid, he's just doing bad  things. Others try to influence him such as a school counseler(Ethan Hawke),  and fellow worker (John Leguizamo), but to no avail. Joe seems to be beyond  help. Joe is eventually caught after stealing some money. The sad part is  he stole the money to pay off one of his father's loans, and buy his mother  new records. (The previous records were brokenbecause of  his fathers  rage.) The final scene between boy and father is one of the most moving  I've seen in awhile.",964310400,13,1438,4.362264150943396
1259390,5,B000038I11,"A stunning, underrated film about the fragility of boys as represented by  Joe Henry.  Whaley shows amazing control and subtlety.  Even the smallest  details resound. Though things seems hopeless for the protagonist, the fact  that the movie is based on the director's own life and he transcended those  circumstances give it a kind of brightness and optimism despite the surface  bleakness of the material.  Wonderful performances, beautifully-shot,  sparingly but powerfully written.",961891200,2,485,5.71830985915493
