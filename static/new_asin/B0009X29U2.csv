8068969,2,B0009X29U2,"I don't know what is that other customers found so good about this video.
The music in nonexistent ( and music is a KEY in spinning ) and the guy talks non stop kind of Guru life motivational .
The guy filming keeps showing the smiling face of one of the girls and it makes no sense at all.
Looks like a MTV  music video from the 80's.

8068971,5,B0009X29U2,"I love Josh Taylor spinning workouts.  There is a good balance of talk vs. workout, and participants are able to push themselves as hard as necessary to achieve the desired results.  This one is a long, slow climb that really kicks butt.  Highly recommend.",1456790400,,256,4.7727272727272725

This is a climb workout between 7 and 9 level, but you can always work it at your own level. If you are wearing a heart rate monitor it means working between 70% and 90%. Most of the time you work between 70 and 80%.

The instructor keeps motivating you and checking form: mind, posture, breathing as well as cadence. Includes:
6 minutes of warm up
10 min Seated flat running
4 min. Standing climb
2 min. Seated climb
7 min. Transition climbing (seated then standing,every 1 or 1 and a half minutes)
10 min Transition climbing (combining seated and standing, you choose)
6 min Recovery
3 min cool down and stretch

I love when he says: Smile, you know you're going to change your body. Your're going to look amazing!!!!",1268524800,11,780,4.524822695035461
