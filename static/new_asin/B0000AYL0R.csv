1909377,2,B0000AYL0R,"Was very disappointed with this DVD after watching it and I warn people who even think of investing in it.
Shnaut is not even a competent Turandot, missing high notes and not even singing some!
The ending is not even worth the price of this DVD, give it a miss",1069632000,5,260,4.22
1909378,3,B0000AYL0R,"As you probably know by now this is the first time we have had a chance to hear Berio's new ending and that in addition to David Pountney's production are the chief reasons to see this new Turandot. Schnaut is the successor to Gynneth Jones - overly loud and squally. Plus, sorry but she is downright ugly in a part for which men are willing to die. All right twenty rows back in the opera house who cares but unless you are Jane Eaglen no go on video. Of course the tenor is no great looks either but at least he can sing.
But the real question is the ending. I was intrigued by it. No problem telling where Puccini leaves off and Berio begins. It is quite an abrupt shift and I don't think it really works. I do like the soft ending, but not how he gets there.
We still need a video Turandot - the others feature Eva Marton - not much better than Schnaut. Maybe Eaglen will grace us with one.",1066694400,3,894,4.114285714285714
1909379,5,B0000AYL0R,"This DVD brings us a very important development in the life of the opera Turandot:  the Berio ending.  A couple of years ago the contemporary Italian composer Luciano Berio composed an alternative ending to the opera, to replace that supplied by Franco Alfano.  (Puccini died before he could complete the last act of Turandot -- what he would have done had he lived a couple of more years is one of history's great tantalizing mysteries.)
If for nothing more, this DVD is of great interest to Puccini and Turandot fans for that ending.  And it is a very interesting ending.  Where Alfano is simplistic and loud, Berio is subtle and varied.  The new ending is vastly more interesting than that of Alfano -- it actually addresses, in some satisfactory manner,  the great problem of how Turandot can transform from ice princess to human being in a mere fifteen minutes of singing.
Some viewers will not like the staging, which casts everyone in a phantasmagoric Peking of half-human, half-machine beings.  This is a matter of taste.  There can be no ""realistic"" staging of Turandot -- to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, there is simply no ""real"" there.  Turandot is a fantasy, pure and simple, and how one visualizes the fantasy is subjective in all cases.  I found David Pountny's approach to be as good as any I have seen.
The casting features mature, accomplished singers in all the roles. One cannot fault the singing in any major way.  The staging does call for them to be rather static in their acting, but this is not their fault.  Unfortunately, there are a few occasions in the recording in which the singers are overwhelmed by the orchestra -- probably an issue of microphone placement or mixing.
This may not be the ideal first Turandot for someone not already familiar with the opera, but, fortunately, there are other choices.  DVDs of productions from the Met and San Francisco are both available, and both are more traditional.  But for a Turandot aficionado, this DVD is an absolute must-have.",1063238400,38,2001,4.826979472140763
1909380,4,B0000AYL0R,"This release has lots to recommend it.  The sets and costumes go for that retro-future look found in movies like ""Metropolis"", ""Brazil"", or ""City of Lost Children"".  The inhabitants of these worlds share one more thing in common: they live under despotic rule.  Their condition both physical and political, just like the character of Turandot, undergoes a radical change during the course of the opera.  Act I looks the most like Jules Verne's vision of the future, a stunning act II boasts simply spectacular sets, while the last act is more subdued, more human.  Whatever you think of the concept there can be no arguing the fact that everything looks like no expense was spared - too often radical productions of standard repertory look so cheap.
  Of great significance is that this is the first Turandot released that has Luciano Berio's completion of the work Puccini left unfinished.  I had to watch it a couple of times to get used to it.  As Gabriele Schnaut states in an interview that is part of the DVD extras, this new finale is unabashedly Berio's, not pseudo-Puccini, and it works.  With Alfano's ending there can be no doubt that you've just heard a fairy tale.  Berio brings this fantasy world closer to our own, and rather than the ""happily ever after"" we get that uneasy, exciting sensation brought about by hope, love being its instigator.  I'm not saying it's better or worse than Alfano's - it's there and now audiences have a choice.
  I enjoyed the direction, in particular the movements by and around Turandot.  The Turandot-Liu exchange I found the most revealing, with a nice touch added at the point Liu commits suicide (if that's what you call what happens here), when Turandot literally becomes Liu through the removal of her regal coat.  The action around Liu's body (which remains on stage until almost the very end of the opera) might be the only aspect of the production that could be accused of being eurotrashy. Schnaut is the best in the acting department, with vivid and expressive facial expressions. Hers is a large, dependable voice, not perfect, not beautiful.  Have we ever had an ideal Turandot?  I found her no less convincing vocally or physically than the other most tolerable choice on video, Eva Marton.  Botha's good acting moments seem to happen by accident, though he's competent enough and sings very well, occasionally overpowered by the orchestra.  For those who care about these things: he does sing the optional high C towards the end of Act II, and it's good one.  I was very sad with Cristina Gallardo-Domas' performance.  She seems not to have shed Lius from other productions with stereotypical Victor Book of Opera ""I'm Chinese"" poses when in this whole affair no one is pretending to have any close affinity to the Far East other than what the text ""inconveniently"" makes them say.  So maybe this is the director's fault, not so her singing: wobbly, unsteady and thin, no hint of that sweetness and beauty you could hear just a few years ago.  I really hope she was just having a bad night.  Paata Burchuladze, looking considerably slimmer than last time I saw him, does a great job with his small role.  The three masks, wearing complicated costumes, are also more than adequate.  This is not an opera where the conducting is going to unveil some deeply insightful revelations: it's a big show, and Gergiev conducts expertly with full, even, lush sounds from his orchestra, no controversial tempos or outbursts.
  Every now and then there are moments when you wish you had a wider angle of vision because you know things are happening on stage you cannot see.  Other than that the video direction is generally good, not the usual Brian Large smell-the-sweat, see-the-nose-hairs close-ups of most of his Met videos.  The sound is excellent.  Both the Italian and Spanish subtitles are screwed up and anything with an accent mark comes out as a different symbol.
  Nothing wrong with liking the Zeffirelli circus from the Met (I do), Mehta's Beijing extravaganza, or San Francisco's airplane ladder (the other DVD choices).  But if you want something a bit less traditional yet thoughtful and professionally executed, you will enjoy this performance.  There's also the added bonus of a valiant modern attempt to complete what Puccini left unfinished.",1062979200,14,4312,4.899310344827586
1909381,1,B0000AYL0R,"I have first to admit that my opinion might not be that of every one; but let me put the facts before you and judge for yourself before throwing away the price of this disc.
This is one of these Eurotrash ""concept"" operas in which the populace of Peking are parts of a large machine that consciously echo Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" from the silent era and possibly Woody Allen's ""Sleepers"" of a more recent time. With a very large chorus all made up to look like robots and machine parts, we have Ping, Pang and Pong, one with a saw for a hand, one with a wrench, and one looking like Peter Lorre in ""Mad Love.""
I am on tender ground here, but the Liu is most unattractive I have seen in any sympathetic role while the tenor makes Pavarotti at his widest look thin. Through most of Act I, the director has him seated, even when demanding ""Let me pass."" I braved Act I and tried to watch Act II, but one singer in the opening trio was in a spot where the mike did not pick up his voice and what we had was a duet. It was at the point, I gave up.
Now there might be some of you out there who like this sort of thing. But to me, opera is about PEOPLE--yes, even ""Cunning Little Vixen"" where the animals are thinly disguised human types.
Dehumanizing the people of Peking makes their fear of Turadot's retribution utter nonsense, as it does their pity for the Prince of Persia and for Liu. Machine parts do not particularly care about things like that. Given all this, there is no point in discussing the muscial aspects at all.
So let the buyer beware. You are warned.",1062115200,31,1564,4.251677852348993
1909382,1,B0000AYL0R,"Turandot is my favorite opera and I've seen five versions--this one is so ugly, it is painful to watch.  I purchased this DVD for the Berio ending, but I won't keep it in my collection. The Devo-inspired sets and costumes are ludicrous and the cast abominable.  A dreadful experience!",1192579200,4,284,4.775510204081633
1909383,4,B0000AYL0R,"A very different staging of this classic. Audience seems usure of what to think at first. Bought it for the Berio ending, which is an interesting alternative. Style gets a bit modern in sound, and not nearly as loud and powerful at the end as the Alfano (which, emotionally I've always liked). Berio's ""intermezzo"" slows down the action for awhile but makes sense of the transition in Turandot.  Always felt that part in Alfano's version kind of lost it's way. Check the interviews for some good insights. In the end, I actually liked it as much as the Alfano ending that is traditional.",1169337600,3,587,4.699029126213592
1909384,3,B0000AYL0R,"Esta produccin de DAVID POUNTNEY es la principal razn de ser de este dvd. Es una actualizacin muy inteligente de la ltima pera pucciniana, en mundo robotizado muy acorde con la filosofa de la obra. Quiz no sea la mejor produccin para alguien que se acerca a esta pera por primera vez, pero sin duda si se conoce a fondo la obra, esta produccin hace disfrutar.

El reparto vocal cuenta con dos buenos cantantes, que aqu se muestran sin embargo incmodos por ser poco adecuados a los papeles que se les encomiendan. Son GABRIELLE SCHNAUT como Turandot y JOHAN BOTHA como Calaf, que pasan ms de un problema de estilo y tesitura. Sin embargo elevan el nivel la angelical Liu de CRISTINA GALLARDO-DOMAS y el sincero Timur de PAATA BURDZULADZE, rindiendo a gran nivel el resto del reparto. El coro, importantsimo en esta pera, suena con la fuerza necesaria.

La direccin de VALERY GERGIEV, al mando de la Filarmnica de Viena, peca de exceso de decibelios, sobre todo en el primer acto.

Cabe apuntar para acabar que esta produccin opta por el final alternativo de la pera, que compuso LUCIANO BERIO, en vez del ms frecuente de Alfano.",1129334400,2,1127,4.681818181818182
1909385,3,B0000AYL0R,"Let's NOT get silly about this unusual production of TURANDOT ~ it probably comes closest to the original vision - since it is not realistic [to say the least].

RUMOR has it that Puccini loosely based this on fact [his neurotic wife, a fling with a suicide-obsessed maid, etc].  APART from a poor sound engeneering job - the rest is most arresting.

Recommended for loves of the Arts who are familiar with other stagings of THIS OPERA, otherwise - stay away.

[And stop knocking the tenor ~ someone worth watching!]",1126396800,2,516,4.7
1909386,2,B0000AYL0R,"In Peking the heralds announce that another suitor to the beautiful princess Turandot will be executed in the morning. The citizens of the city complain again for  the fate that has condemmed the kingdom to live under the cruel decision of the princess. Among the crowd an old man falls and  the girl who is with him ask for help. Suddenly  a man appears. He is prince Calaf. He helps the old man and then we know that he is the old king Timur. Defeated and living like a beggar helped only by  a poor slave: Liu. We know then that Liu is in love with the prince and he thanks her for being so good to his father. But then everything stops. The prince of Persia would be executed because he failed to guess the three riddles princess Turandot has proposed. Among the crowd in the execution Calaf see the beautiful princess and, of course he falls in love with her. His father wants him to forget the challenge, Liu wants him to forget the challenge, and even the three ministers Ping, Pang and Pong want that too, but Calaf has decided he will win the hand of the princess.

In the second act, we are at the imperial court. The emperor arrives complains about the terrible challenge his daughter has settled and tried to convince Calaf to leave. But he is stubborn and says he will win. Then appears Turandot. Magnificent and cold. Explaining why she has decided to play that cruel game. She presents the riddles and one by one Calaf says the right answers. Defeated Turandot ask her father for mercy but he says that she has set the rules and must admit that she has been defeated. Calaf then proposes a new game. If she next day can say his name he would leave her.

The third act opens with a city awaken trying to find out the name of the prince. A desperate Turandot orders that Timur and Liu were tortured to reveal the name of the stranger. Liu tells her that she knows the name but she will die before teeling it . And that is what she does. Killing herself before betray her prince. Everybody is shocked for her action, even Turandot. Calaf then reveals his name and kiss her. In the morning before the court Turandot announces she knows the name of the prince. His name is Love.

This is the last opera by Puccini. In fact he did not finish it. He was able to write till the death of Liu. The end was finished by Alfano , a fellow composer. But in this dvd we can listen the end written by Berio. Turandot it is for me one of the jewels in the opera. The music is wonderful. A modern opera in fact, that comes from the impressionist music of the end of the XIXth century to the new concepts of XXth one. It is an opera that, in my opinion needs three things: a good orchestra, two good sopranos and a good choir.

This production for the Salzburg festival has a good orchestra, well conducted by Valery Gergiev. The begining of the opera is wonderfully played. It has the perfect volume and tension. Something quite difficult sometimes. In fact the orchestra sounds wonderfully when is alone or with the choir. I am not sure when it is with singers. ""In questa reggia"" sometimes there is not sound but noise and sometimes we almost miss the beautiful melody hidden. But I htink that this is due to the second thing this opera needs. The sopranos. Ms Schnant has a great voice, a dramatic one, but honestly she does not play a good Turandot. Too much vibrato and a poor diction. Specially in the second act where she is leading the story. Sometimes is almost impossible to understand her. But Liu, played by Christina Gallardo-Domas is another thing. Her Liu is never tacky. It is beautiful, her countenance is charming and her ""Tu che del gel sei cinta"" is really moving. She and Burdinladze are, by far the best of the opera. About our Calaf, what can I say? Waiting for his ""Nessun dorma"" was a waste of time. He seems lost. He lacks of the passion of the prince. Good voice but not for this opera.

The production is interesting. A kind of Metropolis version. Where individuals are nothing but parts of this machine of destruction that Turandot has created. The second act is spectacular with a Turandot suspended over the court threatening the prince and expressing her anger. But it seems too cold for me. Maybe I am too classic but this production lacks of passion and this is what is about Turandot. Th eprincess is the only character who really makes an evolution from the quite and cold one in the first act, to the furious in the second one to end moved  and heartbreaking after Liu's death. Her loneliness and fear are not shown here. Not by the singer or the production. And it is a pity because that is the main appeal of this opera. The choir is good and also the performance of Burdunladze, but I am afraid is not a memorable  production, although interesting if you are a fan of Turandot.",1114387200,11,4814,4.40990990990991
1909387,4,B0000AYL0R,"This is a very unusual performance of ""Turandot"".  As one who always prefers traditional stagings, I found myself actually liking this highly unorthodox production.  Puccini died before he could complete the opera (right after the death of  the slavegirl Liu), and Franco Alfano completed it, based on Puccini's own sketches, and this is how the opera has been heard ever since.  But in 2001, Luciano Berio took at Puccini's sketches and composed HIS version of an ending, and this is what we hear in this performance. This new ending by Luciano Berio shortens the opera by about twenty minutes, and eliminates a lot of the music we are accustomed hearing sung by Turandot and Prince Calaf.  What it enables us to see is the melting of Turandot and her reaction to the death of Liu.  It is a little strange, but it somehow manages to engage interest.  Then, quick as a flash, Turandot and Calaf are united, and the opera is over.  The production itself?  Well, considering what we see these days, this is at least interesting and somewhat colorful.  The idea is that Turandot reigns over an  automated and unfeeling society, where people are treated like machines.  Where did THIS come from?  Who knows?  ---  these stage directors take liberties that were unheard of years ago.  Gabriele Schnaut is a big voiced dramatic soprano( Birgit Nilsson she's not!), and she creates an interesting portrait,  but she's far from faultless in her vocalization.  Johan Botha sings adequately as Calaf, but he's so incredibly fat that no costume can do him justice.  Visually, he is a definite liability.  The most appealing member of the cast is Christina Gallardo-Domas, whose Liu is geniuinely and deeply sung and felt.  Valery Gergiev does an excellent job with the orchestra, and moves the opera along at at an urgent pace.  This is a highly unusual ""Turandot"", one that many may dislike.  But there's a lot of unique and interesting stuff here, and it should be viewed with an open mind.  I happen to like it ---- far more than I thought I would.",1111363200,10,2040,4.795977011494253
1909388,4,B0000AYL0R,"Yes, and all at the same time, in spite of sounding contradictory. For mind you, this is no ordinary Turandot. From the musical point of view it has the important attractiveness of presenting Luciano Berio's ending, composed as an alternative to the well known by Alfano in use since the 1920's and that per se sets it apart. The cast in this 2002 Salzburg Festival production is typical of today's world in which italian operas are given without a single italian in the cast. Singing quality will be not to everyone's liking and not precisely because of the lack of italianit in the principals' voices as a consequence of the absence of italians, but rather because of the very condition of the voices in some of them. Gallardo-Domas's and Schnaut's are the most questionable; one thing is vibrato and quite another is wobble. I recall attending a Turandot performance in San Francisco some 12 years ago (available in dvd, by the way) in which Eva Marton's wobble was so obtrusive as to make sitting throughout the whole performance almost intolerable; Schnaut and Gallardo-Domas don't ""sin"" to that extreme in this set but are certainly questionable, especially if you laid out over 300 euros for the entrance ticket at the Grosses Festpielhaus. The german singer's problems seem to derive from plain voice wear (she's been around for close to 30 years now, and that certainly counts, with all due respect), the chilean's sound more like the effect of an ill-conceived effort of stressing a voice unsuitable to such a large venue as the Grosses Festpielhaus. Burchuladze's voice has also deteriorated importantly along the years but the range the Timur part moves into allows him to keep wobble under reasonable control and he still commands an engaging timbre. Botha acquits himself well, to me he is the better singer of the lot and I'd propose most of the problems others commented in this website are attributable more to microphone placing and his distance (or nearness) to them, this being a live performance. His is not a large voice, granted, but he's no tenorino either, perhaps the ORF engineers had to make allowances in microphone placing so the tuxedoed and pearled audience would not complain too much. And yes, the orchestra sometimes  overpowers the singers but in so richly scored a piece this would be normal in the theatre. Tear still has a lot of voice left and projects a fine Emperor and Ping, Pang and Pong are quite good. The VPO play very well and with their usual refinement, their golden sound a definitive plus in this score; Gergiev seems to stress the 20th Century aspects of the score more than others who from that perspective appear to aim at pushing Puccini 30 years backwards: you end up hearing orchestral details that you'd seldom spot unless you were following the performance with a printed score, that do make you realise Puccini did study the music being composed by his contemporaries rather closely.

There are some very stunning ideas in Pountney's stage proposition, others that seem not to work as well. In no way I'd dismiss it outrightly as ""eurotrashy"" as other commentators in this website seem to imply. Acts 2 and 3 seem to work out better than the first one. The setting for the riddle solving scene is most impressive, with the Ice Princess atop a 9-metre high thing inside a gigantic human head (reproduced in the dvd's cover) that all of a sudden comes down to stage-level when Calaf divines the third riddle, as if implying Turandot's sudden crash into human-ness unless she can in turn solve the riddle posed her by the unknown prince. As the third act evolves, the ugly world of dehumanisation portrayed in the first two acts progressively becomes human, until for the closing pages all is resolved into, yes, human-ness. An intriguing concept that well escapes the traditional stagings and certainly worlds apart from Zhang Yimou's beautiful Peking venture that Mehta conducted and which makes use of the Alfano completion.

And what about Berio's ending? Well, definitely count me in among the ones who consider it as more suited to the work than Alfano's. In all likelihood both endings will coexist, but Berio, by his making far more use than Alfano of Puccini's sketches whilst avoiding the imitation of a language that is not his, is more ""on target"" than what Alfano's mimickry of Puccini's style and grandiose utterances achieved: it (Berio's) sounds so more sincere ...",1106870400,9,4439,4.900265957446808
1909389,1,B0000AYL0R,"The scenery is cleverly scientific (about the only positive thing I can say about this Turandot) but the machine parts on the actors are appallingly sinister and the whole thing is most unpleasant to watch.  If the singers had glorious voices, I would close my eyes and listen to it as a CD, but such is not the case.  This is not entertainment, this is torturous to watch; it should never have been made into a DVD.",1097020800,9,416,4.3896103896103895
1909390,5,B0000AYL0R,"A Turandot that will not please everyone (a friend of mine dismissively calls it the ""Borg Opera""), but one that is striking in a fresh interpretation, offering a vision of the de-humanization of society.  Even Turandot does not seem human, which may be a way of understanding her actions.  The creative staging and costumes are stunningly evocative of SF visions of the future.  A lot of thought went into this production, and every time I view it I perceive more ideas.  The music from Act I is among Puccini's most arresting and dramatic. The added music and staging finishing what Puccini did not complete make sense, and deal with our ambivalence (even anger) with the anti-heroine.  The resolution even humanizes the other citizens of this mechinistic, oppressive society.",1085356800,6,778,5.046875

The robotic Ping, Pang, and Pong is eye rolling. Liu's Signore Ascolta sounded nice enough, until her incredibly slow motion collapse at the end that made me laugh out loud.  Calaf was okay, but an underwhelming voice.  Princess Turandot was annoying and not in the way that the character is supposed to be.

This producting is a glorious feast of visuals.  The setting is a gridlike skeleton of a mechanized society, complete with Borg like humanoids and Quay Bros. oversized puppetry.  At the center of the production is a magnificent moon/head sculpture from which emerges Turandot. This concept works admirably in this setting. Unfortunately, the miking of the singers leaves something to be desired.  Too often the orchestra drowns out the singing and even at maximum volume on all three different audio settings (Stereo, digital dolby, DTS) the mix loses those voices.

7997894,4,B0000AYL0R,"Hardly anything is easy about producing or recording Puccini's final opera, Turandot -- the parts are vocally strenuous, especially by the standards of Italian opera; the work is incomplete, so there are several different completions floating around to choose among; and perhaps most challenging of all, the story is dramaturgically flawed and at times decidedly unpleasant.  However, most people reading this review know that the opera is worth it -- a complex score, perhaps Puccini's most accomplished, full of his characteristic melodies and yet darker, more dissonant, and more of its century than anything else the composer wrote.  This set, featuring the new-ish completion by Luciano Berio, is even more modern still, and although it has many flaws, it is worth watching and hearing if you love this opera.

The look of this production, from the 2002 Salzburg Festival, is remarkable (and, straying as it does from the usual overblown chinoiserie one sees in many stagings, divisive).  It has a decidedly ""steampunk"" feel, which may not sound like a good thing in opera, but actually works very well here.  The entire chorus, and most of the minor characters, all show at least some degree of mechanization; the Mandarino, for example, is accompanied by a giant puppet, while Ping, Pang, and Pong (yes, this opera also scores low on cultural sensitivity) have torture-devices for hands.  There is a lot of verticality to the sets -- the chorus is arrayed on a variety of stage-layers, and as can be seen on the cover, Turandot herself is perched atop a high, narrow column from which an enormous gown depends.  It's all very striking, very symbolic, and (appropriately, I think) fin de sicle.  Obviously, most of the reviewers on here hate it, but that's just the story with opera direction, where nothing innovative goes unpunished.  Interestingly, the costuming of the leads is rather less inspiring; Timur appears to be wearing a sweater-vest under his coat, and Calaf is in some kind of monochromatic three-piece suit with a huge trenchcoat draped over it.  The women (when not perched on enormous columns) are arrayed in simple, white gowns.

Unfortunately, while the visual elements of this production are always interesting at the very least, the music itself suffers.  The leads have been much criticized, and not without some justice.  It's not so much that they are hopelessly inadequate as that they just aren't idiomatic or convincing, and they evince little beauty of tone at any time.  Turandot can be a grim piece of theater, and voices with some warmth and beauty really help to carry Puccini's still-gorgeous melodies.  That is not what you get here, except perhaps from Cristina Gallardo-Doms as Li.  Li typically steals the audience's sympathy from the leads just on the strength of the dramaturgy, and this effect is amplified here, since Gallardo-Doms has the most attractive voice (and face, and, well, everything ...).  Even she is not perfect -- her vibrato can be wobbly -- but her high notes are all very much there, and she is subtle in quieter passages.  Next best is Paata Burchuladze as Timur; he really does give the impression that he is blind, and although he sounds old and a bit faded, this is consistent with the character he's playing.

The two leads, while not disasters, are less satisfactory.  Johan Botha comes across on certain recordings (like Sawallisch's Meistersinger) as a sweet-toned, robust jugendlicher Heldentenor, and that may actually be the problem here: his voice simply has none of the Italiante thrill and squillo that Calaf demands.  Heppner's Calaf can be similarly unidiomatic (is it the Italian diction?  I really can't say for sure), but Heppner also brings much more vocal richness to the role, and you just don't get that from Botha here.  The notes are there, but the top notes are quiet and utterly devoid of ring (again, contradicted by his Wagner -- perhaps this just wasn't his night?).  He can seem, perhaps most of all the cast, to be phoning in his acting too.  Schnaut's Turandot is, similarly, all ""there"" on paper, but her tone is exceptionally harsh and a bit matronly.  Yes, I know it's one of the heaviest and least lyrical Italian soprano roles, but again, more warmth and phrasing does so much for this opera.  Birgit Nilsson has proven many times that this is possible even for the most Wagnerian soprano.  Much as I want to praise the direction and set design here, I also think that Schnaut's immobility through much of the action, and her ghoulish makeup, place her at a disadvantage; she seems more frigid and less sympathetic than she otherwise might (when I saw her as Elektra in Vienna a few years after this production, she was quite good -- the role is more suited to her voice, yes, but she was also able to utilize the stage, and her acting was not half bad -- something you'd never guess from this DVD).

The other surprise for me was Gergiev and the Vienna Philharmonic.  The good news is that the orchestra really comes to life for the Berio conclusion.  The bad news is that what comes before is uncharacteristically sloppy and unsubtle.  This is not an easy work to keep coherent, I realize, but the VPO is one of the world's best orchestras, and ought to have sounded much more precise (the gong scene is particularly offensive; nobody seems to know what is happening, and flubbed notes are painfully audible).  The orientalist detail (especially the expanded percussion section) comes across pretty well, and Gergiev can be exciting, but all in all, this is not a recording that shows either the conductor or orchestra to its best advantage.  The chorus is much better, especially considering the kind of choreography they are asked to execute while singing difficult passages.

At this point, it's hard to justify four stars for this DVD, but the ending really is worth it.  Luciano Berio is one of the most accessible postmodern composers, and he always considered himself an heir to the Italian bel canto tradition.  His revised conclusion (allegedly based on newly-discovered Puccini sketches, although that cannot be true of the orchestration, which is unmistakably Berio) attempts to solve some of the dramatic difficulties of the opera, especially as it is usually presented: concluding with Toscanini's truncation of Franco Alfano's completion.  The Alfano, which ends in celebratory mode to the tune of ""Nessun Dorma,"" gets Turandot from sinister ice-queen to romantic lead in a laughably brief time.  Berio's conclusion not only lengthens things by redistributing some vocal lines and adding orchestral interludes, but it also offers a low-key, much quieter ending.  This production highlights the penitential and sober mood even more by having Calaf and Turandot sing their ""love duet"" while washing Li's cadaver -- utterly creepy if you let yourself think about it, but also showing the kind of respect to this much-abused and sympathetic character that might be sufficient to redeem Turandot's and Calaf's tainted relationship.  Best of all, though, Berio's score is intoxicatingly beautiful, pushing Puccini's music into modernist extremes (reminiscent, at times, of Alban Berg) that are basically consistent with the rest of the score.  Like so much of Berio's work, it draws attention to itself while never being obnoxious or inappropriate; it is impossible to imagine Puccini (or anyone) orchestrating the percussion quite the way Berio does here, but his use of Puccini's themes is authentic and original.  Best of all, the VPO finally sounds like itself here, providing a vivid account of the new completion.

In short, this set is deeply flawed and much more disappointing than it ought to be -- particularly the conducting and orchestral playing.  Having the Berio completion on video is really indispensable, though, and this set really delivers.  I would say buy it only for those last minutes, but Gallardo-Doms's Li and the really quite fascinating sets and costumes make the rest of the opera watchable.  While this ought not be your introduction to Turandot, it belongs on the shelves of those who've come to love the work.",1337472000,3,8157,5.034970238095238
7997895,3,B0000AYL0R,"Making the various characters and chorus automatons, to be humanized by Turandot and Calaf's love is an interesting idea, and not really off the story line.  Having seen enough ""Turandot"" productions that have everything but the proverbial kitchen sink (from a Chinese kitchen, no doubt)  thrown onto the stage, having seen Turandots with paste-on fingernails so long she could rake leaves with them, something with original thinking is always worth a try.  I think this production succeeds in supporting the drama a good deal of the time.  I thought Turandot appearing inside that huge mask was a master stroke, at once isolated and imperious.  And when Calaf pierces her world, it collapses like a house of cards and she literally plummets to earth.  Exciting!

Of course, it would have been helpful if the Turandot and Calaf, respecitvely, had been able to actually sing their roles.  They couldn't.  Not SING, that is.

As for their appearances, well, I long ago got over dinging an opera singer too hard for not appearing the part.  However, as Turandot and Calaf progress through their new lives together, perhaps they could seek out a salad bar or two.",1288137600,2,1159,4.953367875647668
7997896,2,B0000AYL0R,Way too contemporary sets with gears and cogs??? Sort of like trying to update a Broadway show. This was a bit of a disappointment as the original story was set in a early dynasty China. I prefer a traditional setting. The music was passable but the sets and costumes are way off the mark. It does not remind you of Early dynasty China.,1257984000,4,336,4.349206349206349

I disliked the production, the singers aren't fantastic, the Orchestra is superb and the conductor, this time, was in a good day. But the end of Berio is a disaster. Lets return to Alfano. We were happy and doesn't know that.",1240358400,2,298,4.339285714285714
7997898,1,B0000AYL0R,"Just watched this DVD- fortunately borrowed from my local library free-of-charge.
Love Turandot.
Hated this performance.
Only thing which would have made it worse:  All black costumes upon a bare black stage with a total-black background.
And the singers are not that good either.
Dieter strikes again!!!!",1207612800,3,305,5.48936170212766
7997899,1,B0000AYL0R,"Many people criticize Alfano's ending with which we are familiar, usually the Toscanini-shortened version.  I say to them, ""Shut up.!""  After hearing the Alfano-Toscanini version dozens of times, the full Alfano a few times, and now the Berio,I think Toscanini got it right with the short Alfano.  Berio added nothing pleasant, still used Puccini themes at times,and ended with a whimper.  The Salzburg production suffers from bad singing, acting, and scenery.  During ""Signore Ascolte"" and Non Piangere, Liu,"" Burchuladze looks as if he is going to cry, ""How did I get into this mess?""",1197504000,3,586,5.191489361702128
7997900,3,B0000AYL0R,"What a spectacle this production is!  Fortunately, I had read the previous reviews and was prepared for the shock of a part-man, part-machine cast and chorus.  David Pountney must be a Star Trek (or Tim Burton) fan to have staged a Puccini opera with a Borg-like society.  Strangely, this didn't bother me much.  (But, don't EVER do this to Rossini!!!)

This really was a colorful spectacle!  The curtain opens to three levels of choristers decked out in masks, machine parts, etc., who line the entire stage.  Everyone moves like robots.

All this was quite distracting for the crucial performances of Ping, Pong and Pang, whose singing seemed secondary (and second rate) to the costumes and jerky choreography.  The only humanoids are Liu, Timur and Calaf.  Christina Gallardo-Domas who played Liu is the only singer I'd give more than three stars.  She was probably the only character in this whole production that anyone could relate to.  The role of the blind father, Timur, played by Paata Burchuladze impressed me only when he mourned Liu's death.  That was the emotional high point for me.  Calaf left me completely cold; even the singing of Nessum dorma was a dud.  Gabriele Schnaut is no Eva Marton; her singing did not appeal to me at all.  But, I've got to hand some acting stars to her for playing so well to the awful tenor!

At the end of this production, the choristers shed their machine parts and masks (but not the black and white mouth makeup) and appeared on stage in dreary grayish clothes, everyone paired in a closing embrace, along with Turnadot and Calaf. Love prevailed.

I think this is worth watching once just for the spectacle and the alternate ending.  The production budget for this must have been enormous!  But, if I watch Turnadot again, it will definitely be the one with Eva Marton and Placido Domingo.",1195603200,3,1840,4.7993630573248405
