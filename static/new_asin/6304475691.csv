896714,5,6304475691,My 5 & 6 year old grandchildren really enjoy this. They love to watch all the sea creatures - and it keeps them entertained on the DVD player when we are in the car waiting in carpool line.,1320883200,,189,4.0
896715,4,6304475691,"Kids really seem to enjoy this one.  As a foster parent, I see that a lot of the kids that come into my home lack the ability to sit and concentrate on anything.  But this video seems to hold the attention of most of them.  I've had a couple boys that were more interested in going out to play soccer in the yard than to watch television, but for the rest: they loved it.  They sat with rapt attention.  The sea creatures ares so colorful and different and the video throws in scenes that makes them laugh.  For example, there is one scene where a big waves splashes a man and when the waves pulls away you can see him tugging his shorts up and you see just the tiniest bit of his [...] and the kids think that is so funny ('cause that sort of thing happens to every kids once in a while and they can relate).  The video shows such interesting creatures that it really opens up a whole new world to many children - a world hey never knew existed.  Also, the songs in the movie are really catchy.",1254441600,7,995,4.119170984455959
896716,5,6304475691,"My 6 year old daughter checked this DVD out at our local library and has watched it four times in the past 24 hours already!  Her 2 year old sister enjoys it as well!

The comments other reviewers have made about the music is sort of true.  They remind me of early 90's music, but I find myself liking them.  My 6 year old likes to listen to the intro over and over again because she likes the song - as cheesy as it is.  And all that matters is that the kids like it, right?

I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD, but I've listened through the whole thing.  It's educational and highlights facts in a way that young children can comprehend it.  I highly recommend the DVD and hope to find other Really Wild Animal DVDs at our library.  If I can't find any there, I will likely buy the 4 set DVD collection from Amazon.

My daughter's complaint is that it's too short!  She wishes it were longer and she's not the type that likes to sit still for any long period of time!",1247097600,10,974,4.1005291005291005
896717,3,6304475691,"Wow I can't believe how disappointed I was with this movie. I thought, since it was National Geographic, that it would just be educational with footage of fish. There is of course a lot of fish footage, but the music that accompanies it is so awful, I almost can't stand to listen to it.  There are numerous songs about being a fish, water, etc.  If it was just instrumental, that would be wonderful, but the songs trying to be catchy and hip, but the writers somehow failed and every time I hear another song come on, I cringe.  There is an animated globe named Spin that has some really lame jokes, but also some educational narration.  I guess my 20 month old son enjoys the movie ok, but usually gets bored after 15 minutes.  I should have gotten something else, this just was not really what I was looking for.",1208563200,14,815,4.406666666666666
896718,5,6304475691,"I bought this for my twin 4 year olds and my 2 year old... they were captivated and so was I!  Great for kids of all ages - funny, and fun, and yet gives a ton of Deep Sea info.  I highly recommend it.",1199923200,5,201,3.5454545454545454
896719,5,6304475691,"My son AJ loves this video so much, he watches it very often!!!!!
 This video is really entertaining and educationl. I got AJ a Really Wild Animals Giftset and it came with this video. AJ loves animals and land animals including the Killer Whale (Orcinus Orca) and he wants to get more Really Wild Animals videos for Christmas.",1088294400,2,327,4.637931034482759
896720,5,6304475691,"My 4 year old son received this video for Christmas and watches it almost everyday.  He's very interested in animals, especially sea animals.  I like the fact that it's very educational and that it keeps him interested and wanting to learn more.  He's going to get more of this type of video for his birthday coming up.",1043452800,5,319,4.56140350877193
896721,5,6304475691,"I have used this video when teaching an animals unit in Science.  My students absolutely love Deep Sea Dive.  It is now June, our animals unit was over in December, yet this is the video they request most!  The video is jam-packed with interesting factoids, which my students love.  I recommend it to anyone.  It is the best of the Really Wild Animals series.",991612800,8,359,4.546875
896863,5,6304475691,Our kids love this. It is very well made and entertaining. Nice colors. The kids learn a lot about the sea world and now the kids want to go scuba diving,1391040000,,153,3.967741935483871
896864,4,6304475691,"My girls enjoy the newer, popular series of documentaries on the big-named TV channels, but lose patience halfway through.  I thought a DVD especially for kids would be more appropriate and appealing.  They both (aged 6 and 8) enjoyed it, but the 8 year old thought there were too many songs.  My only complaint is that in a world of HiDef and BluRay, this DVD was very dated (published in 1994).  I wish National Geographic would update its kids series, but for a younger audience, they may not even notice- mine didn't.",1389398400,,521,4.630434782608695

896866,5,6304475691,I enjoyed this as a kid and still to this day. Glad to see this on DVD and continue to a new generation. The music is still good and I still enjoy it the same way I did when I was Five.,1384646400,,185,3.4285714285714284
896867,5,6304475691,"Kids in 3-5 grades LOVE this DVD. There are little cartoons, jokes, questions along the way. It's not boring and the kids adore it. It is great for those times when you've hit a deadline on lesson plans or grades and need to justify the students leaving you alone for a few.
Also, would be a good preface to a trip to the ocean or an Aquarium.",1377993600,2,343,4.134328358208955
896868,5,6304475691,My students loved watching all the ocean animals. They wanted to know more about the ocean. They pulled out books to see what else might live in the ocean.,1368662400,,155,4.379310344827586
896869,5,6304475691,My five year old grandson has actually memorized every word in this video!  He is fascinated with the oceans and sea creatures so it made a huge hit with him! Very informative and also entertaining.,1367712000,,198,4.6571428571428575

false advertising.
 I took back, buyer beware!  get a different one if looking for dolphins like us!?",1365206400,2,148,4.444444444444445
896871,4,6304475691,"This isn't the kids' favorite video, but it is very informative, and they will watch it multiple times (as long as you throw it into the rotation with other videos).

The sounds can be a little irritating to us adults, but it isn't the most annoying video by a long shot.",1362614400,,271,4.313725490196078

7873885,5,6304475691,My 3rd boy loves it! I bought this to be ready for ocean habitat project in 4th grade -- just give him some ideas. This is for younger kids from toddler to 5 grade +. Fun narration and songs in between. My boy likes singing along the songs.,1497484800,,240,4.020833333333333

However she's only 2, even though she loves fish and turtles, her attention span doesn't last very long. I would recommend it for a child that is a little older. For something that was made in the early nineties, it still holds up and can be both entertaining and educational for younger viewers.",1427241600,2,450,4.5

7873891,5,6304475691,"I watched a bunch of these videos on VHS tapes when I was a kid with my younger siblings.  I think my grandma got them for us to watch.  They are so fun and educational, and what you learn sticks! I just got back from a trip to Jamaica.  One morning of our trip, my friend called me over to look at this ""huge fish"" hanging out by the dock.  I went over to see and it was a good sized lionfish! She was amazed that I knew the name of it off the top of my head, and it was because of Really Wild Animals that I do!  I think I will buy all of these videos for my kids to watch when I have kids.  Until then, I can show them to my nephews!",1421712000,,636,3.639705882352941
