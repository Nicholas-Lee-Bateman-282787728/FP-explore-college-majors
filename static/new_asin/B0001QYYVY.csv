2023936,5,B0001QYYVY,"I really do love Ernest. Although I didn't watch him when I was little. My mom said I wasn't allowed to watch him for some reason. I tried to explain to her that it's for kids, but the cover of one of his movies looked scary to her or something.
But some time last year, I started collecting his movies, and OH BOY, they are great! Commercials, movies and all. He is so hilarious. So when I saw that he had a television show, I pre ordered it right away.
I can't believe how great this program is. It is so cheesy, over the top, crazy and just incredibly childish. The closest thing you can get to a cartoon. I recommend this for kids, because it is built for them. I recommend this to teens, for nostalgia qualities. I recommend this to adults, because it is made by these adults that act like children, so they can find it funny as well.
As for episodes, they are oriented around repetition of characters and short sketches. Each new character grows on you, and the old characters everyone knows already makes it much more comforting.",1295740800,5,1036,4.373056994818653
2023937,5,B0001QYYVY,"If you like Ernest, this dvd is worth having. It's great to watch, and will bring back memories if you remember the show from Saturday mornings. A real treat. Super fast shipping from amazon was a nice bonus. 5 Stars.",1295654400,5,217,4.45
2023938,5,B0001QYYVY,"Jim Varney is no less than a genius.  ""Hey Vern, It's Ernest"" is the best vehicle to prove that point.  The simple and absurdest humor in every sketch is laugh out loud funny.  This is the greatest value per dollar than anything else ever produced!  It's got iguanas on roller skates, giant hair-dos, a family with a clown dad, Ernest slamming his fingers into everything, and the under appreciated talents of Bill Byrge (a.k.a. Bobby).  Buy it and thank the gods for such a treasure.",1295568000,2,484,4.647058823529412
2023939,5,B0001QYYVY,"I can't believe what a great deal this was. It's two DVDs full of Jim Varney. If you're an Ernest fan, there's really not much else you could say. It's just awesome.

I already own all of the Ernest movies that are available in America, but had never seen most of these TV episodes, so this was an unbelievably rare treat for me. For me, it was like seeing NEW Ernest material, roughly 10 years after he left us. That just doesn't happen.

The case was of a design I hadn't seen before: a sturdy hard shell that securely holds the DVDs inside individual paper sleeves. I think it's an improvement over the kind with the plastic snap button in the center, because there is much less risk of damaging the discs. With material this rare, that is a definite plus.

There wasn't any bonus material included, but I doubt there is much left to be released. Other than ""Ernest Goes to School"", I think pretty much everything has been put out on Region 1 DVDs already.

In conclusion, with a release price of under $7 dollars, this deal will make you feel like a Wall Street Tycoon (but hopefully not look like one!).

2023940,5,B0001QYYVY,"Back in the 80's Jim Varney was building a respectable little empire out of his character Ernest P. Worrell. First were the various commercials that got him on the map, then came a few direct to video shenanigans via Ernest and a couple of other Varney characters. Then came the movie Ernest Goes to Camp. From there Varney makes this Saturday morning kids show, which by the way won two Emmy Awards including Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for Jim. Not sure why the show didn't make it past one season, but it is finally available on DVD in its entirety.

Hey, Vern, It's Ernest! is as crazy as most people are describing here. It's essentially short skits that may or may not connect with a situational story arc for the episode. Most of the jokes slant on absurdist comedy aimed for kids. Unexpected quirks are the name of the game. To be honest sometimes it's hit and miss, but that's normally the way for any comedy (as one reviewer mentions Monty Python I remember all the inane and boring skits they did even though they also turned out lots of comedy gold).

Jim Varney used this show as a chance to stretch his comedy a bit and do other characters other than Ernest. You get to see old favorites like the evil, yet silly Dr. Otto, Sergeant Glory and the delightfully indignant Auntie Nelda (Varney it a big woman costume and neck brace... you gotta see it to believe it). Also other characters I don't recall seeing previously like the primp and proper Astor Clement and Baby Ernest (just Varney's face on a baby body talking like Ernest, but baby-like). All of these character, and of course Ernest himself, bring a lot of fun into the show.

It's not all just Varney on this show. He has an ensemble cast with him. Most are regulars on his movies too like always insane buddy duo Chuck and Bobby. Gailard Sartain, who does Chuck, also plays other characters Lonnie Don and his school of Hollywood Sound Effects (it's actually a pretty redundant recurring skit and if it weren't for Gailard's charisma it wouldn't make it past the second incarnation) and others. Mac Bennett, another Varney movie regular, also does some fun skits as a room mate to a lizard named George (not a puppet or toy.. a real lizard that seems to be smarter than Mac). Add about another half dozen colorful actors and you get the whole crew.

Like I said before each show had a theme that would be touched on by many of the skits in that episode. So you will have episodes like Hey Vern, it's School or Hey Vern, it's Sports. They originally aired on CBS in the summer and fall of 1988. Previously they released single episodes on low quality VHS tapes that to be honest looked horrible. Now we get all 13 episodes in a much better format complete in a single two-disk set. Sorry, but there are no extra features, trailers, alternate languages, commentaries or anything on this set. Episodes only. Good thing is you are getting full frame video with two channel stereo audio with almost five hours of content for a list price of just under $10.

2023941,5,B0001QYYVY,"I will never forget the thrill of seeing Jim Varney on his own TV show for the first time. As an 80's child, I was a fan of Ernest, You Can't Do That on Television, and PeeWee's Playhouse--it was only natural that this show was the perfect combination. I am so glad they released this series on DVD! The price is amazing as well. R.I.P. Jim Varney. You will always be one of my favorite actors.",1295222400,2,394,4.197368421052632

2023943,5,B0001QYYVY,"If there was one thing I could say about this release, it would be this: It's about damn time! (Sorry about the French accent there). I didn't catch this show in it's entirety while it aired on TV (I caught at least two episodes that I can remember), but I've also just recently watched some at youtube, and it's really pretty good. As we can see, this series only lasted for one season with thirteen episodes, but it was very funny and, as mentioned above, imaginative. It's also mentioned above that Hey Vern, It's Ernest was compaired to Nick's You Can't Do That On Television and Pee Wee's Playhouse (in my opinion, it is a combination of the two). Someone also once called it a ""Monty Python for kids"". Yep, that pretty much sums it up. The skits were great, the Worrell style humor is intact and the the themes that they worked with each week made for some good story lines in each episode. Bottom line: this show is really good, esspecially for one that was in direct competition with Pee Wee. And for the very reasonable above price, this DVD set will make a great addition to your Ernest collection, knowutimean?",1293321600,47,1121,4.527093596059113

In the Hobbies episode, he urges us to have a hobby of our very own. I have plenty of hobbies to spare. In the episode about Talent, he finds that talent is inside everybody. He sure has talent to make his dummy Woody talk. Pick up this cassete! You may like to see 3 episodes of Hey Vern it's Ernest. Know what I mean?",1265414400,,458,4.157303370786517

2023948,5,B0001QYYVY,I remember watching this show on Sat mornings back in the day. My kids have seen a couple of the Ernest movies and like Pee Wee's Playhouse so  bought this on DVD to watch with them. Video quality is the same as it was back when it was on the old small tube TV (pretty bad)! BUT every bit funny and strange as an Ernest program should be. You get one DVD with all the 30 minute episodes from the 3 seasons it was on. Worth buying if a Jim Varney fan.,1451606400,,450,3.891304347826087

2023951,5,B0001QYYVY,"My kids love ""Earnet Goes to Camp"" which by far is the characters best movie.  This collection of the complete ""Hey Vern, It's Ernest"" series is a great presentation of a wonderful and hard to find Saturday morning kid's show.  If it wasn't for this release this show might forever be lost.  I don't know if it's even available in any other form.  My kids love this show and just watching them laugh their heads off makes it a valuable purchase.

The show is a series of comedy sketches based around a central theme of each episode...its clean, simple and funny.  All the standard, and some new, Ernest characters are thereAuntie Nelda, Dr. Otto, Sergeant Glory, Baby Ernest, and others.  Jim Varney won an Emmy in 1989 for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series and its a shame this series only went one season.

Gailard Sartain's ""Lonnie Don's School of Hollywood Sound Effects"" and Ernest's Haircuts are my favorite bits on the show.

If you need a fun show for kids, like unique humor and crazy performance art or just want to rewatch a show from your childhood this is the item to buy, know what I mean?",1443657600,,1114,4.585858585858586

Even if only in the form of a brief documentary about the character's evolution from pitchman to TV star to film star. But, as bare-bones DVDs go, the audio and visual transfers are excellent.

Last night, I popped in the dvd and my husband, son and I all sat down to watch it.  Let me tell you, this show is very difficult to follow.  The skits are herky-jerky and cut and move on to other skits very very quickly.  At one point, my husband looked over at me and said, ""I don't even think I could make sense of this show if I were baked.""  My son kept saying, ""Let's just watch one of the movies!""

Don't get me wrong.  My entire family is made up of huge Jim Varney fans.  We have nearly every Ernest movie and we watch them all the time.  They're great!  This show is kind of a let-down though.  The upside is, if you like the old lady skit, there are a lot of them on this dvd set.  I guess the short skits are geared more towards kids with attention deficit problems.  When I was a kid, I had trouble paying attention to anything for too long and maybe that's why I loved this show as a child.

2023996,3,B0001QYYVY,"I love Jim Varney.  Ever sense I was a kid, Ernest's knuckle-head persona has charmed me and the rest of my generation with his unabashedly silly slapstick.  Inevitably at the height of Ernest Mania, a show was produced about the character made so famous from the series of hit movies and an endless number of TV commercials.  I remember it being out, I was about 7 at the time, but didn't have much of a recollection of what it was like at such a young age, just that it had Ernest in it. When I discovered it was on DVD, I was thrilled.  Eagerly, I got it and watched it. Did I enjoy it? Well, Yes and No. It was funny, but could have been so much better. The show contained some the crazy characters Varney created throughout the series of movies(most noteworthy, the old lady), plus tons others: a dust bunny, Baby Ernest, Ernest's tongue, a family of clowns, a sound effects guy who only knows how to make a fart noise with his hand, a crappy magician, a weird mad scientist who has a hand atop his head, and an outfit that looks like a hodgepodge of Christmas paraphernalia thrown together, and more.  That is the good news.  What is the bad news? Alas, the series falls in the habit of doing the same things over and over...and OVER again.  Every episode has a theme (sports, movies, food, etc), and is structured virtually identically. Needless to say, though funny at first, it gets old fast.

If you want some good, clean wholesome fun, check out this set. Young or old, it's a must for any fan of Ernest P. Worrell, knowhutimean?",1308009600,2,424,4.51948051948052
2024004,4,B0001QYYVY,"I got this for five bones next to the check stand at a Fred Meyer's store (a great northwest store owned by Kroger's). Why not? I also got a Johnny Test DVD. Both come through Cookie Jar, suggesting a Canadian animation connection, which is all to the good because some of the best cartoons hail from the great white north, both anglais and francais, the left and right coasts. Inside the snap plastic case are two one-sided discs in individual paper sleeves. The odd packaging is best explained by comparing it with Mill Creek Entertainment's Super 300 Cartoon Collection (yes, this show also comes courtesy of Mill Creek)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-300-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B001R1LWZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super 300 Cartoon Collection</a>, which uses the same snap case, but inside the cardboard sleeve you find two such cases, each containing three paper sleeves with one disc each. Such budget packaging allows MC to keep the cost rock bottom, while bringing little-seen cartoons and shows from the past, like these, to an avid, but fiscally strapped, public.

These two sets have more in common then may first appear, because the cartoon collection is chock full of the sort of shorts that kids' TV show hosts used to show in between the live action segments, when Saturday morning was the province of clowns, story ladies, astronauts, sailors, and other adult role models, all showing young viewers a good time, and giving them a leg up in the world, not unlike Ernest P. Worrell with a story and a moral. The difference is that Hey Vern, a DIC production dating from 1988, replaced the cartoons with a manic ensemble comedy cast, something rare since the '60s, when studios found it cheaper to simply buy cartoons by the foot, rather than be held for ransom by tempermental stars.

I wouldn't compare this series with Pee Wee's playhouse, other than that both looked back to the great heyday of Kids's TV. Paul Reubens clearly drew from Pinky Lee, and Hey Vern inherited Soupy Sales' pie-throwing routine. To Reubens' everlasting credit, he fashioned a kid-friendly, award-winning, amazingly creative show from what was originally an adult-aimed HBO special soaked with innuendo. Richard Pryor also made a top-notch kids' show, ""Pryor's Place"". But there were so many other great hosts, from Sandy Becker in New York, to J.P. Patches (Chris Wede) in Minneapolis and Seattle. A really stellar effort to bring back the live host show (which has been tried many times on network and local TV, was Wienerville on Nick, which I sincerely hope makes it out on DVD, as many live Nick shows from the same orbit have done, such as Pete and Pete and Clarissa Explains it All (For more on Kids' TV see Tim Hollis' Hi There Boys and Girls&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hi-There-Boys-and-Girls-America-s-Local-Children-s-TV-Programs/dp/1578063965/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hi There, Boys and Girls! America's Local Children's TV Programs</a>).
Hey Vern starts ""cold""-- with Ernest engaging the viewer, rather than with the quirky theme and clip art retro Photoshop beginning which, by the way, is very likable and infectious. This show could have run forever based on its simple premise: that shows could be about anything, as witnessed in one of the thirteen show titles: ""Hey Vern: It's Pets!"" Of course it's a personality show, a maelstrom whirling around Ernest and his various personae, but the ensemble cast also holds up its fifteen minutes of fame. Some of the best bits are the oddest: George, a live iguana; a robot with a happy face; Ernest as the crazed Dr. Otto; a frenetic barbering sequence resulting in odd hair-dos for Ernest; kids could name a dozen more.

So why the four stars? The end of a show ought to take you back to the menu, but it doesn't. It just starts the next show, so you have to jump up and hit ""menu"" or eject the disc if you want to just play one show at time. And given the open-ended possibilities of the show, it really could have been a lot better than it is. There really isn't either a story or a moral, but a bit of educational stuff could have been slipped in ""Grammar Rock"" style. Some of the bits, like Lonny Donn's sound effects and Matt Finish photographer are almost the same every time, although since this show would have been seen once a week, kids might have looked forward to the same bits and memorized the lines.

Ernest may be an acquired taste, but those who like him can't get enough, and Jim Varney is to be commended for making a clean, lively show for kids, like the kids' show hosts of old, rather than selling out his comic gift, as so many do these days, and making trashy movies and TV. Someone showed us the way. They followed their calling and got it right. Who? Hey Vern: it's Ernest.",1306713600,6,4854,5.026086956521739
2024005,2,B0001QYYVY,"My gosh,I couldn't believe it when I saw this series was available. Besides Pee Wees Playhouse,this was my favourite Saturday morning show of the late 80s. Both were along the same lines in presentation,and what the Playhouse was for Pee Wee Herman,this was a huge showcase for the multi talented Jim Varney. Did you know this one nabbed a couple of Emmy Awards?Yes,one for Outstanding Performer(Varney) and the second for the graphics and design for the show. A show endearingly geared for kids,but again like Pee Wee,one adults could also watch and""get"".A wonderfully funny show with alot of talented folks in front AND behind the cameras. Coke Sams and John Cherry produced this series and would also tag along on Varneys adventures into the film world.
Who can forget Varney's wonderful characters:his own,Auntie Nelda(my fave),Dr. Otto, Sergeant Glory, Baby Ernest and Astor Clement. WAIT a MINUTE!!Stop the presses!!! What happened to Astor Clement? Varney's beloved character of Astor Clement is a no-show in these shows. Why???? From what I can tell it seems that this is the only thing missing from the shows,so the reasoning seems even the more perplexing. There is however a glimmer of hope I can offer to those,like myself,who adored this character. On the ""Essential Ernest Collection"" his entire Astor Clement clips are on there. After watching them there,I had wondered at the time why they had only chosen to highlight all his Astor Clements from the shows. I only thought that someone picked them for their humour and to give a tantalizing taste for the series(which it did).It's a strange and disappointing circumstance indeed,but there you have it.
Next we have Galaird Sartain who played Chuck, Lonnie Don(School of sound effects)& Matt Finish(photographer at large).Next is Bill Byrge(who has finally retired)who played Bobby to Galaird's Chuck(prominent in Varney's subsequent movies),Bruce Arntson who played Existo the Magician, Mike the Clown,Bill(of the singing duet of Bill and Coo),Daniel Butler who played Willie the Homemade Robot, Earl the Barber and Ernest's Tongue,Jackie Welch who played Mrs. Simon Simmons, Coo(to singer Bill) and various other singers and many,many other talented folks. I have to mention one of my favourite characters,dust bunny. He would more often than not appear beside Ernest,chat and sneeze and disappear. This would in turn start Ernest sneezing,bunny would reappear and sneeze and leave again,Ernest would sneeze again,and,well you get the point. Some of the humour could be subtle but most was just plain over the top fun for all;and it worked beautifully. Varney and company made it all look so easy,fun and goofy but if you look a little deeper(and I cannot stress this pooint enough) you can appreciate the talented people who worked so hard to create this show.
I guess it's no secret I loved this show but Mills Entertainment here has let us all down not only by leaving out the Astor Clement spots,but it has done a less than stellar job on the transfer. The picture is acceptable(but not great)on an analog set but if you try and run this DVD set on an LCD or Plasma screen the graininess is quite evident. I have tried it on all three so I know. Also during the ep ""Hey Vern its the Holidays"" Ernest's face briefly goes from full colour to green for a second or two. Probably the film master but this should have been taken care of before release(can you say ""quality control""?).Furthermore,if one wants to get REALLY,REALLY picky,and I'm just the chump for the job,the very ending credits are not the same. The next to last ORIGINAL ending credit had a sea shell and the words Emshell productions beside it. They are there but the very last credit was DIC productions,pronounced ""Deek"" by a little girls voice. The last ending credit NOW is not DIC but Cookie Jar productions who presumably now own the rights to the show. OK Cookie Jar where in the heck is Astor Clement!!???.......argggh! As a P.S. to all this mess,yes this is a two disc set but the packaging is the ODDEST I have ever come across. It is an over size snap case that houses the two DVDs,but inside the DVDs themselves are put into just two ordinary paper and plastic sleeves,which in turn are supposed to be held in place by a square area on one side the size of the DVDs with a couple of claws at one end to ""secure"" them. The top and bottom of this square area has gaps which the other side of the case fills with two half moon shaped protrusions;again to keep the DVDs ""secure"".Well,it took me THREE orders to finally get a set which was A)secured in place and not floating around and B)DVDs that because they had been floating loose,were all scuffed and scratched. The packaging is certainly different....and cheap!
All in all a disappointment. A show I dearly loved,finally comes to DVD but what do we get....a less than stellar transfer,the ending credits gone,questionable packaging to say the least,all of these forgivable sins if they hadn't,on top of THAT,inexplicably taken out ALL Varney's Astor Clement spots!!!.It's not what I would say the best way to honour a talented group of people,let alone its star Jim Varney.

2024007,5,B0001QYYVY,"During the time this show originally ran in Chicago it came on after Garfield & Friends which followed Pee Wee's Playhouse.  I had recorded a few episodes with the commercials in tact but only have one show left on VHS tape.  I say that to say the CBS breaks and the colorful Saturday morning kids commercials were perfect for in between the breaks.  I especially liked CBS's theme, ""Gonna Party here on CBS.""  I'm glad I have that one tape left.

I thought Hey Vern was very funny and imaginative.  Some of the shows were tighter than others but as a whole I'm glad to finally have them all on DVD.  I remember when I read in the local paper that Jim Varney had died from cancer.  It was very sad indeed.  I'll have to look at his movies again but I thought these Saturday morning shows were more suited to his humor than a feature length film.",1300406400,4,845,4.2974683544303796
2024008,5,B0001QYYVY,"I'm so glad this has finally been released on DVD, and in a rather attractive set, I might add. It's been a long time since I've seen these. It brings me back to my childhood when I was 12. I grew up on Ernest P. Worrell. I still remember his Sprite and Mello Yello commercials since his others were local. I became hooked instantly. I was drawn in by his smile. All I knew was that I wanted to see more. ""Hey, Vern! It's Ernest."" is just an awesome series. Varney gets to show off a number of characters to 'Auntie Nelda' whom I am familiar with to 'Sgt. Glory' which I had never gotten to see until this point since he was used for local ads. This show is compared to 'You can't do that on television' which I liked, to 'Pee Wee's Playhouse' which I've never seen. ""Hey, Vern! It's Ernest"" is better by far. There's a moral message to every funny episode, some tongue-in-cheek humor for the adults, who seem to love this just as much as the kiddies, the same crazy sound effects from 'Lonnie Don', a inept magician named Existo, a clown family, and 'Willie the homemade robot'. ""Earl the Barber"" are among my favorite skits in which Ernest wants to look like a 'Wall Street Tycoon' but Earl always confuses that with something that rhymes with Tycoon. For instance: A baby baboon or a clock set on noon. The Dr. Otto character(played by Varney) refers to himself as the 'naive, semi-mad scientist' and his laugh is priceless and is so much fun to watch, especially that creepy hand moving around on his head. It's a joy to see 'Chuck'(Gail Sartain),'Bobby'(Bill Byrge) and 'Earl the Barber and Ernest's tongue'(Dan Butler) in this series as well as others. In the midst of the filth that has saturated Hollywood, the Ernest genre stayed honest and clean and still managed to be just as hilarious. I find myself always going back to the Ernest shows and seeing a true genius at work. He was never vulgar or dirty. Ernest was a lovable, humble, down to earth character. If you're an Ernest fan, this set if for you. I am happy to see a new generation appreciating the humor and sweet nature of Ernest as we adults did in our childhood days. Comics are fleeting. They may be funny for only a little while before we tire of them, but Jim 'Ernest' Varney is here to stay. I admit that after hearing of his passing in 2000, it took a while for me to start watching him again because it was just too hard to watch his shows so soon. He was and still is my favorite actor/comedian of all of time. He was a legend and a kind hearted, good man. You are sorely missed and your fans still love you, Jim. 1949-2000.",1300320000,9,2604,4.371134020618556

I'm a child of the 80's and grew up loving Ernest in all his commercial appearances and always managed to find time on Saturday mornings for this show (and Pee-Wee's Playhouse). The show has held up really well over the years, and it really shows when all my kids are sitting down and cracking up over this show. Hey Vern is heads and tails better than most of the shows on kid's tv anyways.

The transfer quality is solid and the episodes are split evenly through the two dvd's. My only gripe, and why I listed it as four stars, is the case is overly large and the discs were placed inside of black sleeves. Not a deal breaker for under $6 for re-living childhood memories, but I would have liked a real case.

Can't recommend this set enough if you loved the wacky humor of Pee-Wee and 80's culture! RIP Jim Varney, you are definitely missed.",1296777600,2,882,4.371951219512195

Very unforgettable characters, like Lonnie Don, Earl the Barber, ""Brother Bobby"", and lots more!
