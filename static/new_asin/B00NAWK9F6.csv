6626596,4,B00NAWK9F6,"Writer Laura Wade has taken The Bullingdon Club of Oxford University as her inspiration for this rather interesting film. Two undergraduates in their first year in the towering spires are both inducted into the `invite only' riot club. This is a drinking and eating society with its feet firmly placed at the altar of Bacchanalia and incorporating hedonism as a guiding virtue.

Miles (Max Irons) is the nice chap who may be rich and all the rest of it but is essentially more down to earth. Alastair (Sam Clafin) is his foil and tutor partner; he is the typical toff, hooray Henry and all round posh twat. The rest of the club are a collection of Eton and Westminster educated young men who want to prove what a `legend' they all are by getting drunk and flaunting their cash and privilege. The motto of the club seems to be ""to eat till we are sick at the full table of life"" and by golly do they know how - this is their story.

This is actually quite thought provoking around the issues of haves and have nots and respect, virtue and honesty. The gulf between ordinary and privilege is the central theme but there is also a bit of the existential here too. It is also very funny at the beginning but this is a film of two halves and in the second there is little room for mirth. Great performances all round and supported by both Film 4 and the BFI, this is a very well made and realised film that I can only recommend.",1425686400,13,1423,4.345864661654136

I definitely would have stopped once it started to get gross and the spoiled rich kids started in about how pathetic the middle-class is, but I kept hoping they'd grow up or go to prison. Anything! And then it only gets worse! This movie actually made me sick to my stomach and the woman who wrote it should be smacked upside the head. What was the lesson learned? That the wealthy younger British generation are disgusting pigs and that not only can they get away with murder, but they'll move up the social ladder by degrading and beating people they believe are below them. Big boo hiss. If the point is for viewers to never forget this movie consider it a success. Just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm going to yak.",1468022400,2,783,4.406896551724138
6626603,5,B00NAWK9F6,"I am so not sure why this movie has garnered so many negative reviews. This is more satirical than anything else. This is the ""privileged"" class in Britain at it's most heinous and self-entitled. I could never look at this movie as something serious, I would not ever believe that this kind of thing happens now. The rich kids of oxford have a ""riot Club"" that once a year goes to a pre-selected restaurant and whoops it up and does not care who cares. To say these boys are obnoxious is an understatement and on this occasion awful things happen. the entire cast is superb. they play their parts to the hilt without being too tongue in cheek.

6626606,2,B00NAWK9F6,"I've never seen the play on which this film is based, but if it is close to the film in content, I don't think I would have liked it either.

There's a group of young Oxford(esque) boys who are members (new and old) of this very ancient ""dinner"" club called the Riot Club. They are all from the ""BEST"" families - and if you have to ask how to join, then you will not be asked to join - very exclusive - only 10 members each year.

Apparently, the point of the club is to be as nasty and cruel as possible, while looking down your nose at the ""lesser"" people, all the while acting like the most reprehensible, low delinquents.

It IS possible that this would play better in England or the Ivy League US schools are - but I don't think so. I'm not sure what the point of the film is. It focuses on these ""pretty"" boys with platinum heritage, but who are ridiculously portrayed as contemptuous of anyone outside of their own inner circle. ( Think ""The Skulls"" without the promise of enhanced privilege. These guys are already privileged and seem to just be anarchists for the sake of anarchy and outrageous at the expense of hard working people.)

There is no build-up and no resolution. None of these boys are shown to be worthy of our time, emotionally and certainly not worthy of concern/care for their situations.

There is ever so slight of a hint that one of the boys doesn't like what it happening, but that is never explored.

The message of the film seems to be that the privileged go unchecked and can get out of any kind of trouble.

Do we really need a film to tell us that such is the case? We know that is true.",1464566400,6,1622,4.281045751633987

6626635,2,B00NAWK9F6,"What's the worst thing anyone can say about a movie? That it's boring... and that's definitely the case in this adaptation of a play posing as an expose of  young British aristocrats. While the source material seems marginally interesting, it's really hard to say, as the direction is clumsy and some of the acting embarrassingly over the top, so you end up in a stupor of confusion and disbelief. Ultimately, I just wanted it to be over.

Harry Lyons in particular seems to know not the meaning of ""subtlety,"" or maybe he's lost in the haze created by the director's clueless helming. Confusion abounds. Is the movie a sendup of rich English twits, an attack on sincerity, or a muddled, genteel ""Fight Club"" (""riot"" rhymes with ""fight"" in posh speak, evidently)? Nobody will ever know, least of all the filmmakers.

The exception is Max Irons, whose performance manages to lift off a few feet above ground. He is miscast and comes off as less ""polished baby oligarch with conscience"" than as, say, a rugby player hiding the fact that he's on scholarship. Yet he's got the physical presence of a young Albert Finney or Richard Burton. Unfortunately, he's been made to ""emote"" with his face and play up his sensitive qualities in this movie, where we want to see his ferocity and coiled stamina be allowed to explode.

By far the biggest problem, though, is that the source play hasn't been well translated for the screen and the director has no idea how to pull off whosever vision it was to turn this into a movie.",1444262400,4,1515,4.684210526315789

But I found several of its plot elements hard to believe.  Worse, there was the problem that when you're following a gang of young people who are almost always blitzed, the action becomes slow and the dialogue uninteresting.  Still, it was worth it to see the hideous way in which the upper-class youth expected catering to their every whim even while savaging the people serving them, and it was unsettling to know that a number of British greats had been active members of this group.",1442016000,,679,4.504065040650406

The film's social commentary is never insightful enough for it to work as a drama, and it's never funny or outrageous enough for it to work as satire either. This makes the film all the more frustrating to watch because you can see how much potential was here to make a great film. I have a feeling this could have been so much better in the hands of a more experienced director/writer.

6626659,2,B00NAWK9F6,"When you watch a movie, no matter what the subject matter is, if when you reach the credits and ask yourself if that was worth the just over an hour and a half of your life you spent watching it and the answer is yes, then it's a good film.  You can't answer that  question though for The Riot Club with anything other than, well I wished watched something else.  I like villains in films but the characters in this aren't well written nasty or evil people, they are just spoilt rich kids who have had everything including large wads of cash thrown at them their whole lives and have been bailed out of taking any responsibility by their parents and their servants such as lawyers their whole lives.  So when these pompous seeing the rest of society as beneath them teens, hit university, they of course seek membership into the social elite (in their eyes it's seen as a bit of joke by the rest of the student body as evident in an early bar scene) that will set them up for life, like the Stonecutters in The Simpsons.  Membership of The Riot club guarantees members looking out for each other, highly paid employment and other money making networked privileges for life once graduated.

There can only be ten members of the Riot Club's as a student status at one time, and since two have graduated their are two spots up for grabs.  The film is told mostly through one of those wannabe members who has a bit more of a moral compass and less of a superiority complex and sense of entitlement than the others.  He is interested in a female student who has to work to afford to attend Oxford, for example and not just as a notch on the belt like many others in the club would justify spending the time with her for.  However that doesn't mean he's going to put a stop to behaviour that humiliates or hurts those outside of the club.  That's pretty much what the film is, we viewers go along for the journey on this guy's initiation which leads up to a dinner in a rural pub (as all in and close to Oxford have barred the Riot Club for attending due to their poor behaviour in previous years).  Will he do the right thing before innocent people's lives are ruined forever or is membership in this guaranteed life of perks club be too tempting to speak up and physically stop?

The film is very predictable as well, when a non Riot Club person enters a scene you guessed how that was going to play out pretty easily. You do have to hand it to the acting ability of the cast, you certainly dislike the guys as you were supposed to do, I don't fault their acting in my overall rating, in fact I think it actually lifts my rating. But you watch a movie like this and other than will the main guy the movie is about do the right thing, you sort of want to see some comeuppance for nasty characters, which the film doesn't really deliver on.  I also think this film would have worked better being set in the 1950s or something as CCTV cameras are everywhere in the UK, they would have been in the pub they dine in at the end, across Oxford, especially the university, and everywhere else.  Not to mention the public has mobile phones with cameras.  An establishment like Oxford would care enough about their reputation to not really condone this sort of behaviour in this day and age.",1432339200,8,3277,4.3667763157894735

8677027,1,B00NAWK9F6,"Let me get this straight - all rich people are evil?

If you're a conservative (according to this movie), you don't care about anyone and you're actually a psychopath who wants to murder poor people.

The socialist/liberal Miles is the ONLY ONE who sees the club for their disgusting behavior. Propaganda much?

This is a overly political piece of propaganda - geared towards the left and their hatred for the upper middle and upper classes. They want a classless society, a socialist utopia. Hilariously enough, the film portrays all upper class boys as evil, hedonistic and immoral.

Stereotyping at its finest, while pushing an overdone (and false) political agenda.

While Im not saying there aren't wealthy people who behave snobbishly, to make the comparison that they're evil, sociopathic and violent is just... absurd.",1513296000,,826,5.180451127819549
8677028,1,B00NAWK9F6,"I read in one of the reviews The Riot Club is based on the Bullingdon Club, a vortex for our promising leaders and shapers of the modern world; and that the decadence, violence, bravado, depravity and moral corruption shown in the film reflects the real club well. If this is so, then the film should have been handled more seriously and less clichd as it is a serious subject. And surely if it is true, then we should be hearing more about it in the media - or are we to take it that the play and movie are ground breaking? (I think not.) Do such murders occur yearly in the club and are the publicans that host the dinners annually really so tolerant? Maybe they are . . . but in which case, there is little hope, and if people are willing to accept such behaviour it only serves to justify it further.

As it is, the film doesn't pass muster on any level. It's not engaging as a horror film or exploitation film as it's not an enjoyable film. It is too boring because formulaic (compare this to Kill Your Friends) and the violence and brutality is too real (so plain old nasty). A major flaw, given the subject, is the charisma of the depicted 'elite' is more based on caricatures of preening, popular, attractive stardom rather than British aristocracy (no Boris Johnson / David Cameron lookalikes here they wouldn't be dashing or fascinating enough for the silver screen). Apart from the really nasty sexism and violence, a lot of the pranks just look like a punk band gone wrong, and then when you throw in the pseudo-philosophical political debates to reflect the enormous intelligence of these charming thugs it all starts to wobble. You get the feeling that the stars are hypocrites to make a film about Oxford corruption, when they too are aimed towards an elitism of their own (stardom) which would espouse similar corruption in some of its darker corners, thus rubbing it in and further exploiting such practices.

To be fair I should have given the film 2 stars as it did make me think about the subject and no doubt some involved in the project had good intentions to expose the issues. But who cares about fairness right? The subject deserves proper consideration and defter handling - ultimately this is the failing of the film.",1513036800,,2244,4.579601990049751
8677029,2,B00NAWK9F6,"As my daughter is a Cantabrigian, I do enjoy seeing films set in Oxbridge, if only because it remains opaque to me.  This is a film about the worst excesses of the notoriously snobby super-elite, who run amok and assume they can buy their way out of anything.  So, a neophyte Oxonian gets initiated and, as the excesses go way beyond what he imagined possible, he nearly loses everything and then in a cynical twist miraculously doesn't.  I have to say, this was an agonizing spectacle to watch, hewing as it did to a simple formula, an escalation into horror and a quick fix without redemption.  I suppose by tone it is something of a cautionary tale as it damages the boy's life and he declines to continue in the club.  However, it shows almost nothing of the hard work and idealism of the overwhelming majority of students in Cam and Oxford.

'Posh' is one of the best plays of the past decade, and I will forever remember the exhilaration of watching it.  It is a play that bubbles with tension whilst being hurting-your-cheeks-from-smiling-so-much funny; the combination of these elements speaks to the skill of Laura Wade as a writer, sneaking into Martin McDonagh's turf.  Sadly everything that makes 'Posh' great is missing here.  It is devoid of subtlety, there is little menace and they really - REALLY - forgot to bring the funny.  And it really is such a shame, as the ingredients were all there, and a number of the cast would surely have excelled if they'd got their hands of the real thing, but it wasn't to be.

'Posh' wasn't broke, it didn't need fixing... but they went ahead and did it anyway.  Find the play, see the play.  Or read the play.  Anything but this.",1486166400,2,865,4.631578947368421
