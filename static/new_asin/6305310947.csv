1007771,5,6305310947,"This is the best martial arts film I have ever seen. It starts off well with Young Jackie getting taught by an old man (who seems a bit too much like a paedophile to start with).  Jackie gets a bit good at kick, punch,  chop (!) although he keeps it a secret from his pacifist father.  The old  man gets funnier and funnier as the film goes on as he rustles through  bushes and pulls off hilariously bad oneliners.  He is almost smiling  throughout the entire film and the bit where he and Jackie go and pay the  rent is priceless.  As a film to watch on your own this is probably not  great but invite a few mates around and you can really have a good laugh  taking the peas out of this one.  Highly recommended for fans of the 'So  bad it's good' genre.",914371200,,755,4.089041095890411

In this movie, Chan is continually fighting a gang of bullies to protect his family. Then continually fighting those responsible, after the his father is killed.  There are a lot of really silly cartoon characters. I didn't care for it. The entire movie is kind of comical.

Jackie Chan looks about 20 years old in this movie. Those that like Jackie Chan may enjoy seeing his early work, but if looking to see Mao Ying...you'll be pissed.  I know I was. Amazon issued a prompt refund.",1330905600,2,660,4.421487603305785

Jackie stars as a young man out to avenge his father's murder in ""Master"" and is part of an ensemble in the Dirty Dozen-ish ""Fantasy.""

1008194,1,6305310947,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market.

Unfortunately there are altogether 7 errors on the DVD.  The chapters move on up once. Chapters - 2,5,8,10,16,18,19

However, the film itself is a mediocre patchwork mess, with plenty of footage with a Jackie double. During one fight scene, blink and you'll miss both Mars and Yuen Biao, longtime JC collaborators.

The biggest problem with this release is that the DVD is poorly manufactured. On two different DVD players, I could not get the disc to read properly. The disc would jump to random chapters every ten minutes or so in one DVD player; it wouldn't even read at all in the other one! I would suggest saving your money and, if you really MUST have this movie, buy one of the many other releases of the film.

When Jackie left his first director, a hack names Lay Lo, (Bruce Lee fan may reconize the name, he took credit for the first few movies Bruce made) Jackie had to sign over the rights to all of his early movies to him (on account this jerk sicked the Tri-ad on Jackie).  With the rights to Jackie's early films, and Jackie now a smash hit, Lo hacked up Jackie's older films, and used bits and peaces on of each of them to make a ""new movie"" called Master with Cracked Fingers.

1008265,2,6305310947,"This film marked Jackie Chan's first lead role in the world of the Hong Kong film industry. This film had a classic plot of vengence and Kung Fu training much similar to the Shaw Brothers era films of the 60's and 70's. The film was a low budget, slipshod, chop socky Kung Fu flick which plots Chan as a waitor at his Uncle's resturant. It follows Jackie from his childhood of eagerness towards Kung Fu where he learns from a dirty old beggar (Classic master from 100's of Kung Fu flicks throughout the 70's) and learns the Snake Fist style as well as the mystical art of blind fighting. After learning from the old man and fighting the local triad mobs that are torturing his Uncle he exacts revenge on his fathers killer. However, Jackie did not finish filming this film and in 1978 a shifty producer used a Jackie Chan look alike to continue the filming. The film even uses scenes from Drunken Master and has Jackie blindfolded at the end in order not to show that a look alike was used. This film does have its moments though and if your a Chan fan like myself, you'll definitely want to pick this one up for your collection!!!",986169600,9,1131,4.416267942583732

That being said, a young Jackie Chan stars in this movie, playing Jackie Chan...LOL. Maybe his character name got lost in translation. Theme of this movie: You killed my father. I must get revenge. Jackie Chan plays a child who learns kung fu from the drunken master aka old Beggar (played by Yuen Siu Tin--you see him in a lot of movies with his slow motion drunken kung fu moves). Jackie Chan's guardian doesn't want him to fight, but bad guys bullying his uncle, sister and others force his hand. Jackie beats up the lower level hoodlums, then their boss, and finally has a showdown with the big boss, who, as we later find out, killed Jackie's father.

I almost gave this movie 2 stars, but then 1 hour into the movie Jackie starts showing his kick-ass kung fu moves, earning a 3rd star. Considering this is early in his career, it's amazing how talented he is. If you skipped through the slow parts or fast forwarded to the last 18 minutes, you wouldn't really miss much.
