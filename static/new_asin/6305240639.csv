995341,5,6305240639,"This movie is so funny! It starts out a little slow, but give it a chance! Its about a 10 year high shool reunion, and its a little bit like a soap opera, with lots of different stories going on at the same time. Lara Flynn Boyle totally steals the show as the class prankster, I wish I could be her! The movie has all the ""stock"" reunion characters, like the 'nobody' turned big time , the rebel and the perky girl in charge of everything. It's also really interesting because all the different characters have accomplished different things, from parenthood, to becoming a doctor, to accomplishing NOTHING, which is probably very realistic. You need a sense of humour to enjoy this show, so if you're lacking, don't bother. This movie also has my most FAVORITE movie sex scene.",998697600,6,778,4.60431654676259
995342,1,6305240639,"This may be the worst movie I've ever seen.
None of the characters, attending a 10-year high school reunion, are likeable in any way.
There is nothing--absolutely nothing--that is any any way amusing about this  ""comedy.""
In fact, one of the plotlines involves a clearly  psychotic girl threatening a baby's life.  Other parts of it display  blatant cruelty on the parts of the protagonists.
It would be interesting  to know how this movie came to be made.  How the script was written.  What  the producer and director had in mind.  Such a study might provide a  valuable resource for avoiding such unmitigated disasters in the future.",960595200,10,635,4.90566037735849
995343,4,6305240639,"This is the epitome of high school reunion films.  If you ever wondered what yours could be like, you should watch this movie.  There is a wide range of characters to follow, all doing different things with their lives,  with different agendas and goals.  David Schwimmer is actually very funny,  and Lara Flynn Boyle's character is hilariously evil.  I would definitely  recommend watching this movie--there is great dialogue.",959990400,7,427,5.1911764705882355
995344,5,6305240639,First and foremost... Teri Hatcher rocks. The movie was funny and the cameo appearances were great. It would all be perfect if this movie wasn't so expensive.,933638400,,158,4.888888888888889
995345,5,6305240639,"David Schwimmer gives a tour-de-force as a first time director.  The ensemble cast, featuring the lovely Teri Hatcher and the vivacious Lara Flynn Boyle, manage to encapsulate the very essence of the ""brat  pack"" generation struggling to survive in the 90's.  If you ever  danced to ""Gambler"" or wondered which Izod looked better with  your new Levi's denim jacket then this movie is for you!",921369600,2,392,4.969230769230769
7885834,5,6305240639,This DVD is Region 2 and will not play in most American/Canadian DVD or Blu-Ray players.  You need Region 1 for USA/Canada.  GREAT movie.  Definitely my favorite B movie.,1517788800,,170,4.793103448275862
7885835,5,6305240639,"I rented this movie at first because Molly Ringwald was on the cover. I think she is in this movie all of 30 seconds, but I am soooo glad I watched it! Hilarious, dark humor and clever plot development. Have seen it at least 20 times since then. I recommended to a friend on Friday...on Monday I had a gift bag on my desk with a candy necklace and licorice whips. Watch and you will understand why. I love to laugh and this movie delivers over and over.",1441584000,,453,4.159090909090909

7885838,3,6305240639,"I have liked this film for years. While it's not a great film, it catches, and sometimes spoofs every reunion that you've been to. The guy living on past glories, the faded beauties, the nerd making it good, and the slick con artist. Laura Flynn Boyle is great, and I love the dark humor of her character.",1153267200,,305,4.368421052631579
7885839,1,6305240639,"This movie is really pretty corny, and I'm not up for over-the-top humour...but if you are then maybe you'll like this movie more.  Some parts are too expected, others are just plain crazy, but it's entertaining enough to watch once.",1143504000,,233,4.825
7885840,3,6305240639,I like watching this movie--even though it's not as funny throughout the entire movie as the trailers would indicate.,1140739200,,117,5.2105263157894735
7885841,4,6305240639,"Hilarious!  This is a great high school reunion film with dark comedy.  I thought David Schwimmer did a great job with it.  I've shown this film to several friends, promising them they'd enjoy it.  No one I know had heard of it, but everyone I've shown the film to enjoyed it.  You have to pay attention throughout the film; there's laughs in alot of little details. If you don't, you'll miss them.  I've shown it to several different people, so I've seen it several times~ but I never get tired of it.

If you like the type of humor in Drop Dead Gorgeous and Lucky Numbers, you'll enjoy this film.  You won't be disappointed.",1107648000,,626,4.4298245614035086
7885842,5,6305240639,"This movie is pretty funny.  There are some cute little gags, but the best part of the whole movie is definitely the hotel front desk clerk, who is played by David Downs.  He's hilarious!  He has a lot of great facial expressions, and even though he doesn't have any lines, you know that there's a lot going on with him.  He has Treplev eyes, for sure.  He's one actor I'll definitely keep my eye on in the future!",1068163200,,414,4.256410256410256
7885843,2,6305240639,"You mean to tell me that in Chicago, there are only two black people per graduating class???  David Schwimmer makes an ok attempt at directing, but he directs like he acts...Like Ross Geller on Friends.  On Friends there are no people of color in NYC and I guess the same is true in Chicago.  I am a little tired of seeing this perpetuated in this industry.  Liev Schreiber's dancing cop was terrific.  There is one in every bunch.  I give the two stars for Liev and Laura Flynn Boyle.",1040083200,,485,4.393258426966292
