5140895,2,B0089BSMG6,"Una Familia con suerte (A Lucky Family - 900 minutes)

A widowed vegetable stall proprietor with five children saves an elderly woman from committing suicide off a bridge. In return, she gives him a job at her corporation, very quickly promoting him to President.

He isn't educated, but despite his bombastic personality, he's reasonably smart so he alienates her nephew who expected to inherit the position. That nephew has the most significant arc in this series. Played by Sergio Sendel, Vincente is a drunk, a womanizer, a bully and a crook.

All in all, between the vegetable guy being the natural son of the would-be suicide, who gave him up as an infant, and the goofy main characters, this one is NOT a keeper.

Excellent captions though: Malaprops are NOT easy to translate into another language.",1372982400,,806,4.904411764705882

Una Familia Con Suerte is a soap opera about Pancho Lpez ( Arath de la Torre) and his family. Avon subsidiary president Fernanda Pealoza (Alicia Rodrguez) discovers that she has cancer and decides to commit suicide. She is about to jump off of a bridge when Pancho Lpez (Arath de la Torre), a public market vendor, happens upon her and attempts to dissuade her. He manages to convince her that life is worth fighting for and she comes back to the safety of his delivery truck, La Burra.
Pancho Lpez is a humble low income man with strong characteristics. He's a generous widowed family man, always lending a hand. Although he has intuitive business sense, he believes that money is the root of all evil.",1362960000,,829,4.490066225165563
