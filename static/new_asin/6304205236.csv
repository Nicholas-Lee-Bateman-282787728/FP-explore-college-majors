7864536,5,6304205236,"Just wanted to add that the transfer is quite OK.  It is fun if you do not expect Indiana Jones and like British humor that is not at Cook and Moore levels but still self mocking and a bit saucy.  I picked this up for cheap on the basis of an IMDB indication of the filming in Mauritius and my liking of comic style adventures (like Indiana Jones or Yellowbeard), and found that it was amusing and very like a visit to Mauritius with some comedy and some sightseeing (pretty island, mountains, ships, beaches, bays and people).  Just silly and pleasant.  Some props are a bit low budget but you do not notice given the comic strip heritage.  The Nazi plane was built in a beautiful spot by the sea with Mauritius peaks as a backdrop but who cares.  I loved how the camera cut to Jane's worried looking dachsund every time something happened.",1202688000,7,841,4.428571428571429
7864537,4,6304205236,"I was initially attracted by the old fashioned, pin-up style poster for JANE AND THE LOST CITY (Anchor Bay) and assumed the movie to be a grade Z exploitation.  Instead, I was surprised to find a sweet and silly lightweight farce from 1987 based on the popular comic strip in London's Daily Mirror that began in the early 30s.

During World War II, Jane thrilled readers as she battled Nazis using her bravery, innocence and her silky, French underwear which was ""accidentally"" exposed on a regular basis.

In this adventure, condensed from comic strip elements, Jane and her cohorts the Colonel and Tombs are on the trail of a lost city hiding a huge diamond cache that could help win the WW II for the allies  Can Jane prevail against the dreaded Leopard Queen?  And will she be able to keep her clothes from being ripped off?

Rated: PG.  Genre: Period Comedy.  92 Minutes. Starring:  Kirsten Hughes, Sam Jones, Maud Adams, Jasper Carrot, Robin Bailey, Graham Stark.  Director:  Terry Marcel.",1122940800,13,995,4.794117647058823
7864538,4,6304205236,"I recently found ""Jane and the Lost City"" by accident at my local video rental shop. I thought it looked junky and camp so I rented it. What I got instead was a super mellow rendition of the world war two daily  mirror comic strip ""Jane"" which basically concerned the lead  character Jane and her cohorts the Colonel and Tombs the butler  ""confounding the Nazi's at every turn"" by pure dumb luck. During  this process Jane keeps getting her clothes torn off (to lingerie level) by  a variety of unlikely means. In other words, a very silly operation. The  film is so mellow that if you need something to go to sleep in front of  this will do nicely, allowing you to wake up occasionally and see more  lingerie and hear more silly dialogue. I watched ""Jane"" twice in  24 hours and liked it very much. Very good trash indeed.",949104000,30,823,4.433333333333334
