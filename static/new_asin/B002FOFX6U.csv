3923219,5,B002FOFX6U,We pretty much have all Veggie Tale dvds made and this is so far the favorite of my 2 year old. Now we can give Lessons from the Sock Drawer a rest. We got this the day it came out and she wants to watch it several times a day. As I am writing this she has given it a break today and is watching Silly Songs but really if we need to get work done we pop in Veggie Tales. My oldest is 17 and he will still watch em with his younger sisters! They have been a part of our family for years and I still get excited to see new ones come out and have yet to be disappointed!!,1255910400,3,568,3.6639344262295084
3923220,5,B002FOFX6U,"Watching Saint Nicholas, one can only note how much better it is than most of the recent holiday specials, which try to have a moral to the story, but end up flat and heavy-handed. VeggieTales, on the other hand, go far beyond morals to express big ideas. The recent VeggieTales movie, The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-Who-Don-t-Do-Anything-A-Veggie-Tales-Movie-Widescreen/dp/B001CK7ONI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie (Widescreen)</a>, was the sort of superior entertainment that, while it enthralls kids, also engages adults. It's hard to believe this featurette is only 45 minutes, because it runs the gamut from light laughs to moving pathos to profound finale, the same arc as a feature film. Adults who happen to walk by while it's on TV will probably find themselves drawn in. Kids will see something new every time.

Bob the tomato tells the true story of St. Nicholas, while Larry the cuke constantly interrupts with more conventional ideas of Santa Claus. The real saint threw bags of money down the chimneys of poor women to save them from being forced into brothels. In this kid-friendly version, young Nick saves the poor from going to jail. Either way, he becomes the patron saint of those who fight human trafficking. The DVD includes ways for kids and families to help a long-established charity called Samaritan's Purse, and a catchy video by Matthew West and Amy Grant, ""Give This Christmas Away.""

There's an intense scene when the young Nick's parents die, which might be disturbing for very young kids, like similar scenes in Disney films like Bambi. The film is filled with witty asides and references to holiday trivia and packed with well-performed, singable songs. There's even a pirate who makes an appearance from the recent feature film. Bonus features include ""Sing Along with Larry"", an art gallery, and ""Give This Christmas Away"" music video. The previews include trailers for current VeggieTales, as well as bits on Cure International, which provides medical help for kids in need, and MOPS, a support group for Mothers Of Pre-Schoolers.

VeggieTales are inspiring on many levels: CGI animation that is second to none, garden-fresh story lines, sparkling wit to laugh-out-loud humor, a rough ride to the happy ending denouement, and they make you feel better, not worse. But this DVD, linking, as it does, an entertaining story to tangible ways to help, may be the biggest idea yet for bringing joy to the world.",1255824000,34,2575,5.33743842364532
3923221,4,B002FOFX6U,"Excellent topic & much NEEDED discussion for children!
this can really open up doors for a separation between what has become Santa and the roots of St. Nicholas.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the imagined snow and the sheep that became like reindeer.. i really think they stretched it too much and I'm not sure that younger kids will be able to separate it out between what is being imagined and what they are really trying to portray about the actual story.

the music is great.

the music video made me cry.

the intent of the video is AMAZING.

the story is wonderful & really necessary. I am so glad they made this!",1255132800,11,649,4.286885245901639
3923222,5,B002FOFX6U,"Everyone's favorite vegetables are back with their third Christmas DVD.  And they've really knocked it out of the park.

Skipping the countertop scenario, our story opens in a small town on Christmas Eve.  The kids are excited about all the presents they will get the next day, until Laura Carrot's dad has trouble with his car that may cost him his job.  In the quiet that follows, Bob decides telling the story of Nicholas should help.

And so we travel back to Greece in the third century.  Aided by Larry (who tries to move the story forward and make it more festive), Bob tell us about a young boy named Nicholas.  His family is well off, but he can't understand why his parents spend so much time giving.  After their early death, he sets out to find happiness again.  Can he do it?  What might he learn from his search?

This is a bit more of a serious story than you might normally expect.  They do a fairly decent job of retelling the legend of St. Nicholas without getting into the ramifications of the modern day legend.

But this video is still funny.  Most of the humor comes from Larry, who keeps exasperating Bob by trying to fit the story into the Santa legend.  Of course, the costumes Mr. Lunt wears as he helps Nicholas in the second half are laugh out loud funny as well.  Especially the second one.

Speaking of whom, Mr. Lunt does the silly song this go around.  ""Donuts for Benny"" starts out fun but gets super silly at the end.  I loved it!  I swear the music reminded me of a classic Christian song, but I couldn't place which one it was.

The music is great on this video as a whole.  There are several original songs, but they also parody Christmas classics like ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

While a tad more on the serious side, this is a real gem.  Get this now, and your family will enjoy it for years to come.",1254787200,15,1849,4.354838709677419

Bob and Larry do a great job comically dealing with some very difficult issues: loosing one's parents, financial difficulty, giving vs. getting, giving without being afraid of not having anything for yourself later, serving others as an expression of serving Jesus, the 'glitz' of Christmas and what should be our real focus. It also demonstrates that it is possible for people to mature and change from stinging or scared to boldly generous. It also highlights the importance of family.

I was extremely outraged with this show and that it's teaching the wrong history to who knows how many children. They butchered the story of St. Nicholas. I'm Catholic and celebrating St. Nicholas' Day and showing what a wonderful and generous man he was is important.

Even though she's too young to fully understand it now it will be an excellent way to help teach her about Santa as she gets older.

3923465,1,B002FOFX6U,"I was very sad and angry to see how the VT crew butchered the life of a powerful saint.  Saint Nicholas was a good and holy man, not a misguided preacher's kid.  I can even get over the silliness about him being a masked hero running through the streets, but I cannot stand the slander of his early life.  If you aren't going to speak the truth about holy men, avoid their stories completely.  BTW he was not Greek, he was from Turkey.  Getting kinda sick of the Orthodox=ethnic associations that seem to be acceptable.  There was plenty to produce a powerful story of learning and loving God as you grow up into the faith, not turning it into the false ""He got saved"" moment that is the typical adult Evangelical conversion story.",1283126400,32,731,4.458646616541353
3923466,5,B002FOFX6U,It's what you'd expect from Veggie Tales.  It makes me wonder how much of the story is true though.  I can accept the silliness but they were supposed to be telling the story of who Saint Nicholas really was and it get's pretty unrealistic at the end.  It's still fun and a good story about giving!,1273968000,,298,4.285714285714286

3923468,5,B002FOFX6U,"For parents facing the dilemma of Santa taking away the true meaning of Christmas- yet not wanting their child to miss out on the magic of Santa- this video explains who St. Nicholas is (the real guy in history) in a fun, music-filled way, that makes you want to just GIVE, GIVE, and GIVE instead of worrying about what he is going to bring you.  Jesus is still the most important part of Christmas- Santa just makes it a little more magical and the spirit of giving a little more fun!",1265155200,6,485,4.329670329670329
3923469,5,B002FOFX6U,"Once again, the veggie tales folks come through with an entertaining video with a message.  The Saint Nicholas story very skillfully weaves the secular with the religious.  It simply emphasizes why we give at Christmas.  Well done.  We had a mix of ages watching it and all ages - even adults - were laughing and learning.",1264809600,2,322,4.696428571428571

3923472,4,B002FOFX6U,"The meaning of the story is to help chidren understand the true meaning of christmas, not give them a history lesson. Most of the Veggie Tales movies tell stories ""based"" on the actual story. There is a little silliness and it has to be told so that even the youngest viewers can understand. If you want your child to know the ""true"" story of St Nicholas find something else. If you want your child to understand what the true meaning of Christmas is then this is a great start. The song ""Give this Christmas away is a great song for the little ones to learn and sing while they are giving to others during the holiday season. Don't rely on television to teach your children these stories, do some research and actually teach them yourself.",1262131200,4,740,4.488888888888889
3923474,5,B002FOFX6U,"My husband is a huge Veggie Tales fan and as such has collected nearly all of the Veggie Tale movies. We enjoyed this one as a family, especially since it seemed to get back to the ""good old Veggies"" where the discussion of the Lord was readily apparent. While in some of the newer Veggies, God takes a backseat, this was not the case in this movie. It was well-written, thought-provoking, and a great discussion starter regarding Jesus' love for us and through that, our ability to love others because He first loved us. It's also a great discussion starter for serving others and taking care of those less fortunate. I highly recommend it and have added Veggie Tales: Saint Nicholas: A Story of Joyful Giving to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog.",1261958400,,759,4.62962962962963
3923475,3,B002FOFX6U,"We were a bit disappointed in this Veggitales Christmas offering.  Some of the characters were not readily-identifiable as fruit or veggies and the story dragged.  The music was also disappointing - not very memorable.

Stick with the older ""Toy That Saved Christmas"" or ""Star of Christmas"" offerings from Veggietales - they were much better products.",1261526400,2,351,5.345454545454546
3923476,5,B002FOFX6U,"I bought this for my grandchildren.  It is very entertaining, and teaches them that Christmas is not about getting but about giving.  The kids loved it and play it over and over.",1261180800,,178,4.53125
3923477,2,B002FOFX6U,"St. Nicholas was born and raised in Patara, Asia Minor (Turkey), not Greece.  When he went away it was because he wanted to live a monastic life.  It was not because he was confused about why his parents were so generous!  And the reason he was generous to the girls was because they did not have dowries.  They would have become slaves had he not offered the dowry.  And this is only one of MANY of the things that St. Nicholas, a boy who became bishop of Myra, did including many miracles.  To the new VeggieTales writers, I have to say, ""Do some research before you write.""

Then, as a previous reviewer said, there's all sorts of Santa Claus (whose name is actually derived from St. Nicholas) hype like flying ""reindeer,"" the red suit ~ I can guarantee a person in the late 200s or early 300s would never have worn that! ~ and snow.  Ridiculous!

I was sorely disappointed. I only give it two stars because my kids still like the bounciness and Larry still has some cute quips.

For a true story, buy a book like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Nicholas-The-Wonder-Worker/dp/0879734817/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Nicholas: The Wonder Worker</a>.",1260316800,11,1199,5.102564102564102
3923478,5,B002FOFX6U,"My kids love this new movie. They can't seem to get enough of it. Awesome message, specially now when people focus so much on ""stuff"". Very straight forward message about Jesus being the reason for the season. Kudos to the Big Idea guys!",1260316800,,237,4.534883720930233
3923479,5,B002FOFX6U,Very fun christmas movie. All kinds of teaching moments in this video. My favorite line in the movie is we don't give because it makes us feel happy. We give because we are happy.:),1260316800,,181,4.352941176470588
3923480,1,B002FOFX6U,"First, let me say we are big Veggie Tales fans, or perhaps I should say Classic Veggie Tales fans, as more and more of their more recent offerings have fallen flat for us.

We were hopeful for this latest Veggie Tale, especially since it started off with the premise that Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber would explain who Saint Nicholas really was.  In the beginning, the story does just that, showing Nicholas' life as a young boy in ancient Greece, and is in fact fairly accurate through Nicholas becoming an orphan.

It is Nicholas' (young) adult life that the Veggie Tales team takes creative license with.  Had this not been a story about an actual historical figure AND one that was claiming to set history straight, I would have had no problem with the ensuing silliness.  But instead of sharing the story of how Nicholas helped 3 daughters with no dowry money by throwing sacks of coins through their window late at night, the V.T. team puts Nicholas in ridiculous disguises, the last looking basically like a modern day Santa Claus.  Not only do they manage to get a red fur-trimmed suit into the ancient Greece setting, but they also add snow, trips down chimneys, and a ""sleigh"" and ""reindeer"" into the story.  Granted, Larry the Cucumber is trying to make it more ""Christmasy"" but in doing so, he's gone right back to confusing children as to who St. Nicholas actually was.

So once again, I can only recommend a book instead of a video.  If your children are ready to hear the true story of St. Nicholas (as my 6 and 4 year old were), then I can only suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Santa-Are-You-For-Real/dp/0849914922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Santa, Are You For Real?</a>&nbsp;by Harold Myra.

I certainly hope the V.T. team can return to their roots.  This video (even its ""silly"" song) left us sorely disappointed.  Here's hoping I can return it to my local Christian bookstore...",1260230400,52,1956,5.003086419753086

3923500,5,B002FOFX6U,"Perfect for those who want to share the positive Christian roots of the modern-day Santa Claus.  This wonderful ""Veggie Version"" of the life of Saint Nicholas is perfect for children and quite entertaining for adults as well.  Instead of the kitchen sink, we find ourselves in a fictional modern-day village.  Junior is making plans for extravagant spending while Laura Carrot's father is in jeopardy of loosing his job.  After some crazy ideas from Larry, Bob brings the perspective with a retelling of the life of Nicholas and how his parents modeled giving and sacrifice.  Viewers unfamiliar with the life of Saint Nicholas might want to be aware that his parents' death is instrumental to his life mission and even a Veggie version cannot leave it out.  We were pleased with the compassionate and gentle way it was shared.  Nicholas travels the world to learn the answer to his questions ultimately lay in his own hometown.  Back in the Veggie-village, Junior is moved and inspires others to discover the true joy of giving!

Quite frankly, the ""Donuts for Benny"" Silly Song (w/Mr. Lunt) was obnoxious (yes, even for a silly song) - but such a small part of the DVD that we didn't feel it warranted reducing the review.

We loved the information about Operation Christmas Child as well bonus features:
""Give This Christmas Away"" music video featuring Matthew West & Amy Grant
Behind the Scenes
Art Gallery
Audio Commentary filled with interesting facts about production and additional information about the life of Saint Nicholas

I was very excited to watch this because the other 2 VeggieTales Christmas dvd's are excellent and I was not disappointed. This show takes you through so many different emotions in about 45 minutes. It was sad when Nicholas' parents die but that is part of the true story and should not be left out. They did a wonderful job dealing with that. There are also some hilarious moments (especially Mr. Lunt). This dvd is great for the kids and parents alike!!!,1259280000,2,544,4.505050505050505

3923506,5,B002FOFX6U,"I bought this video the other day for my girls.  I'd have purchased it anyway because we're a Veggies family, but what really caught my eye was that it has a music video and Veggie cartoon promoting Operation Christmas Child. Our church and school support that project and we had the shoeboxes to put together. I put the video in while we did the boxes and it really helped my kids get a better understanding of what we were doing and for whom we were doing it.

The video itself is typical Veggies - it's a great story, framing human tragedies and triumphs in a package that little kids can get, along with all sorts of very funny stuff for Mom and Dad too.  You can't go wrong with the Veggies at Christmastime and for $10, what's not to love!?",1258070400,5,746,4.314285714285714
3923507,5,B002FOFX6U,"I've told my son that there was, indeed, a ""Santa Claus"" in the form of St. Nicholas. When I saw that the Veggie Tales crew was coming out with a DVD about St. Nick, I ordered it immediately.

We have quite a few Veggie Tales DVDs (we're not even Christians), and have always found them to be clever, funny and well-produced eye-candy that presents noble values and practices.

We watched Saint Nicholas last night, and my son and I teared up. I didn't know Nicholas lost his parents as a child, and that they basically died while helping others during a plague. They modeled a life of giving and sharing to young Nicholas. In this DVD, Bob, Larry, Nicky Pepper and company demonstrate the origins of St. Nick (and perhaps even practices of Santa Claus, such as filling stockings and passing gifts through the chimney), including the influence his parents had upon him and the community.

The silly song about a dog wanting donuts was pretty corny--not as good as most other silly songs--but hey! we don't buy Veggie Tales for the silly songs anyway. :o)

I wish there were more Bonus Features on this particular DVD (like they have on other ones...such as drawing demonstrations, games, screen saves, etc.), but for the price, the Saint Nicholas Veggie Tales DVD is an absolute gem.

I'm glad we added this to our extensive holiday DVD collection, and I know we'll watch it again and again--and probably without a dry eye each time.

Highly recommended!
