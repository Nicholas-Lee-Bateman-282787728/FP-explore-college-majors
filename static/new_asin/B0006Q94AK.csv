2191330,2,B0006Q94AK,"I'm really surprised that this movie is getting so many positive reviews. I've been on a Lifetime movie kick lately and some of them are so bad they're good. This one was almost painful to watch. I'm sorry, but if a 14 year old girl had had syphilis when I was in high school, the social worker wouldn't have kept it quiet. You don't really have a right to that kind of privacy until you turn 18. Also, wild sex parties with unlimited weed? It just doesn't work that way. I found this film to just be over the top cheesy. I feel like it was made to be shown in a middle school health class. Save your $4. Watch ""Liz and Dick"" or ""Murder in the Hamptons."" Way better movies with FAR better acting.",1458000000,,696,4.162962962962963

2191352,3,B0006Q94AK,"This movie addresses some important teen issues, but it is more of an exaggeration than the real truth.  If you were to take EVERY aspect of sexuality, magnify it, and then throw all problems into one cauldron, then that would be the scenario with this presentation.  It is true that some girls are promiscuous, but the action in this story is more of a caricature than the truth.",1404086400,,380,4.573529411764706
2191353,4,B0006Q94AK,"Personally, I can't add anything more to the positive reviews (and praise) already
heaped upon this effort.

I will chime in however, on the fact that, as a parent, one should recognize the fact
that these kids aren't like us...the proliferation of the internet has really desensitized
children to things like sex (in particular).  Don't be afraid to be very open and honest
with your kids - else events in this movie may come back to...haunt you!

2191356,5,B0006Q94AK,"I had seen this on T.V. It came in excellent condition and within the time-set. I cannot say enough about this DVD, its storyline and underlying message of immorality, teenage peer pressure and the indifference shown by some ""modern day thinking"" parents in regards to the flagrant sexual behavior of their child, boy or girl,  by ""understanding"" and giving their child privacy.instead of parental control and discipline.  In contrast, is the family, who is at the other end of the spectrum: caring, concerned and involved by trying to make the high school and parents aware of what is going on, especially when tragic consequences develop as a result of the ongoing sex among the teenage students. Meanwhile,their daughter has to deal with the peer pressure, not always successfully.

We ordered it right away for her to watch due to the fact there would be no repeat this year of the program. She did not say much but, the fact she viewed it assures us she knows the outcomes of making poor choices.",1320883200,,364,4.0
2191361,3,B0006Q94AK,"I found much of what was in this movie shocking and disgusting. The main male character was played weakly, he was supposed to be some hot stud that all the girls wanted but was not really good looking enough to play the part. When the scene came on where the girl said she had slept with 15-20 boys, I was thinking was 16 and was bothered by it. Then I find out that the girl is only 14! We find out later that this is because her mother is about as immature as she is, she basically encourages her daughter to have sex so she can be more popular. I can't imagine a 14 year old girl having that many sex partners, unless she was raped or abused at a younger age, or having sex with older men.
Throughout the movie there is a persistant theme that the guys are basically douchebags who just want sex, watching porn and basically trying to reenact whats in porn movies. The movie seems to show girls only having sex because it will make them popular, or because they think the guy will just leave them and find someone else. This idea that pornography and unhealthy views of sex have become so prevalent among teenagers really bothers me, but I think (and hope) this is an extreme case. One thing I didn't like about the movie was the rehashing of old gender double standards...guys are just jerks who want sex any way they can get it, and if girls have sex they are just doing it to please the guy. I thought this whole emphasis on being ""popular"" was way overdone...Please God tell me people aren't really that stupid.

I was disappointed in the ending, there wasn't really any resolution.",1300924800,,1589,4.368243243243243

2191367,2,B0006Q94AK,"I had to watch this movie in my health class, and I have to say that it did not capture real life in many senses at all.  One of the things I found the most troubling about this movie was the fact that there were so many ""parties"" with unlimited weed and booze and girls and no parents, and it really doesn't work out that way most of the time in real life.  Also, the director tried to make up for lack of a budget by shooting strange angles and perspectives of everyday things.  No matter how you shoot it, a movie theater is still a movie theater, as far as I know.  I just felt the movie was weak overall: granted it was made for TV, but just do yourself a favor and watch something that actually has some decent substance...",1240185600,,729,4.112676056338028

I also liked the music used in the soundtrack and wonder if there's anyone reading this who knows what two songs are that are used in She's Too Young, I'd be grateful if you could pass their titles/artists onto me. The first song is the one used in the opening credits when Hannah & her friends are getting ready to go out. The second song is used in the scene where Hannah finds the sores inside her mouth and it sounds like the words are ""over me under you"" or something like that. I've tried a google search for production info to no avail. If you can help me, please send me a message at EricaSummerell@aol.com

2191375,3,B0006Q94AK,"I actually saw this in my health class this year.  For a health class movie, it was pretty good, or at least a nice break from normal informational movies from the seventies (thankfully they're getting away from those now), still in my view it seems overly catastrophicist.  They also didn't delve into the sex-ed programmes at the subject school, and it seemed like they shifted the entire focus of the ""epidemic"" to the students and parents.

Then again, the focus on syphillis is an interesting choice, especially since with the advent of HIV/AIDS, other STDs have fallen into the background on main education, and in the case of many teens, fallen to the realm of jokes.  This may prevent teens from taking this movie seriously.",1136937600,,732,4.832
2191376,4,B0006Q94AK,"(CAUTION for spoilers!)  In the movie She's Too Young, the dominant contrast corresponds to its intrinsic interest because it symbolizes the popularity that Hannah Vogul wants to become and because it symbolizes the subject about Dawn catching a disease.  On the other hand, the subject of getting in with the crowd means that Hannah, Becca, and Dawn has to put out the rest of their world.

 Being a high school student that I am, I am taking Film as/and Literature.  For my Monthly Movie Review of November, I watched a Lifetime movie called She's Too Young.  Although this was my second time watching the movie, the first time I've watched it was on the Lifetime channel early this year.

 Adolescence is a time when teenagers go through mistakes without realizing it.  In She's Too Young, the dominant contrast is about three girls living two separate lives, one at home and one outside the home.  Within those closed doors though, lies a world of its own game. This leads to the intrinsic interest of the movie.  The three fourteen year old girls, Hannah Vogul, Becca White, and Dawn Gensler, are pressured to have sex in order to become one of the popular girls in school.  This subject results to blocking their own parents out of their teenage life.

 Dominant contrast is an area of an image that immediately attracts you attention.  In the movie, it starts off by showing a little girl in a blue baiting suit playing in the light brown sands.  Your eyes goes instantly to the blue suit, which symbolizes the innocence of childhood.  The next scene shows Hannah Vogul putting on makeup and getting dressed for an evening with some friends.  The lipstick and the bright clothing attract your eyes immediately, which is a symbol that the childhood of innocence is about to become a dilemma. Furthermore, in the scene where Hannah is playing her viola in the center of her room, instantly your eyes are drawn to the instrument.  This captures the intelligent, innocent, talented, and the virgin Hannah.  Another example of dominant contrast is after dates with the most popular guy in school, Nick Hartman, Hannah loose something very precious to her in order to become known.  ""I had a fantasy."" Hannah types this to Becca on her I.M. messaging and the camera is focused on her computer typing those words in colors.  The next example is Hannah was crying in front of her computer chatting with Tommy.  ""You're right he is the enemy.""  This shot shows the words in black on the white background on the computer and it symbolizes the fact that Hannah loosing her virginity to some popular guy does not make her the popular girl she has wanted to be.

 Intrinsic interest means that through the context of the story, the audience knows that an object is more important dramatically than it appears to be visually.  An example of intrinsic interest is Dawn sitting down at the nurse's office getting her mouth checked.  This leads you to conclude that something terribly shocking is about to come in the movie.  Dawn sitting down at talking to the State of Public Health is another example of intrinsic interest.  The scene shows the office doors closed and that Dawn is crying through the holes of the open blinds on the glass paneling by the door.  As you see Dawn crying, you automatically think that she received an awful news, which is her catching a disease from having multiple sex partners.  The last example of intrinsic interest is when the letter about syphilis, a disease that can be transmitted from another individual, gets out to the student body.  As a result, the high school students rip and throw the white paper around.  This shows that the object, which is the letter, is being unknowledgeable and that students are not accepting the fact that catching a disease from having sex is contagious.

 Furthermore, the facts of getting in the crowd leads to Hannah, Becca, and Dawn putting out the rest of their own life.  As for the three girls, the unsafe parties they attend symbolize the intrinsic interest meanings through the context of the story.  For example, the party shows people drinking alcohol, smoking, and having sex.  These images say that the girls are on a road of danger if it means drinking, smoking, and having sex is a way to popularity.  Another example is when Hannah, Becca, and Dawn all find out that they all have syphilis from having sex with the same guy, Nick Hartman.  The symbolic meaning behind this is that syphilis is a disease that anyone can catch, especially from young teenagers who has multiple sex partners.  The last example is the scene when Trish Vogul, goes to the State of Public Health and ask for more information on syphilis.  This symbolizes that Trish is willing to help her daughter and other parents who have a child that has syphilis.

 Never do something against your will just to fit in with the crowd.",1134604800,,4878,4.747919143876338

2191379,5,B0006Q94AK,"This is, by far and away, the best original movie I've seen Lifetime aire on their network.  It made me really think about how glad I am to have grown up in the late 70's and early 80's when being ""good"" was still mostly considered the norm.  The kids where I live are the basic same age as the ones portrayed in this story--some even younger--and they are doing a lot of the same things as the aberrant teenagers depicted here.  They also have the same cocky I-don't-have-to-listen-to-you attitude.

What's funny, however, is I recall getting smart with my own mother about the topic of sex and various other things, and I realize  looking back that some things never change.  Kids may think they're old enough to do the things their parents tell them not to do, but they still don't know any more than we ever did.  Excellent job by our main character Alexis Dziena as a basically good but troubled teen who is battling with dangerous social norms and Marcia Gay Harden as her mother taking the bull by the horns once an epidemic of syphilis breaks out among the students.  Unlike years ago, I approved of the majority of her actions and feelings, but I'm also grateful I don't have kids in this sexually charged society.  There are some very disturbing pictures of untreated syphilis when Dziena's character looks them up on the net, and the topic is troublesome in a good way.

This movie should be mandatory viewing in all high schools because, as one woman in the movie said, you can preach abstinence all you want, but sooner or later most of these kids are going to play follow the leader.  Hopefully, this well-done  movie will make them think before they act.",1117670400,,1669,4.582491582491582
