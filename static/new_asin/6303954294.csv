741310,4,6303954294,"In an age of over-coached and over-couched potatoed children, this film about kids growing up in the Irish countryside speaks of a time long ago when we made our own fun before the advent of television.  I grew up  during World War II, wore Sergeant stripes, dug trenches, and made  amphibious landings in old row boats.  This movie was made for kids and  is about, simply, growing up and making your own fun. It is about bullies  and the playground and best of all, it is about friendship.  There is  one magical movie moment in the film that will remain with me always - the  scene in the hideout when the buttons descend.",913248000,,624,4.451327433628318

741534,4,6303954294,This has one of my favorite actors in it. As you may have guessed Colm Meaney. Star trek game. This is where I first spotted him. Ever since then I try to watch movies he is in. This one is one of the off the wall kind. Much like the van  which he also stars in. Is a funny and enjoyable movie. Worth the watch,1493856000,,310,3.769230769230769

741539,5,6303954294,"I cannot believe this only has a 4 star rating, it's gotta be one of the best kids movies ever! My boys and girl absolutely loved it, watched it many times over and now my grown son calls it a classic. I've always loved the movie too. The young actors are amazing, the movie is horribly funny and clever and always feels fresh. There's nothing creepy or indecent in this film, don't worry about the kids bare butts. They're running into ""battle"" with a rival gang of boys and are counting on the element of surprise and shock, and it works, the other boys take off running. You really don't see anything, this picture here on the DVD cover shows more than the movie does.
It's pretty realistic, the kids aren't little angels, they're rough and tumble kids and they have problems and they have heart. They're trying to act like men do so they start a war. No one gets seriously hurt but one kid does get a belting from his step-father which you hear but don't see.  Mostly the kids get some bruised egos, they learn and move on and the movie's over.
This is a great movie. And when I was a little girl we fought like cats and dogs if we thought we had a reason to. And a lot of kids today still have to fight. Childhood isn't a glossy little Disney movie and it never was. This movie honestly acknowledges that. It tells an entertaining story but overall--its just plain funny.",1486425600,,1376,4.35408560311284

741604,5,6303954294,"This is such a good movie, I can't understand why it isn't more well-known. It's a classic rich kids vs poor kids hijinks with lots of endearing characters and fun (and also serious) situations. The Irish accents can be hard to understand at first, but it really adds to the fun of the movie. It's told from the point of view of one of the children. It deals with lots of the big issues in life - family, friendship, jealousy, revenge, redemption, temptation, disappointment, and victory. There's humor and bittersweetness, and it has a really cute ending.",1471910400,3,556,4.742268041237113

On second viewing I saw some flaws in it that I didn't notice on first viewing. I'm not so sure that my friend will like it, so, I'm going to pass on the gift idea. With that said, I would recommend that you view it on a night when there isn't anything else to do. How can you beat Amazon's price of $2.99?",1413676800,,472,3.9789473684210526

Ultimately, I ended up trying it on my computer, and it did work there.  Importantly though, I had to change the region code my computer was registered as being in, and that can only be done a few times.  In other words, I'll soon be SOL.

While the DVD has not been released in non-European formatting, this Warner Collection copy -- which is apparently made from a master on demand -- was excellently done!!!!  Would heartily recommend it!

It's a story of poor kids fighting a ""war"" with rich kids just for the hell of it.  It's about the strategies they employ to wage the war. It's about the friendships they build, and destroy, along the way to self-discovery and maturity. It's about finding out where exactly you belong in the grand scheme of things.

I did not bother to view this when it first came out and only did so based on the impending release of a new versio set in France (this one is in Ireland) during WWII. It's interesting three different directors would find enough material in the story for it to be redone every few decades. Anyway, this version is rather decently done and does follow the tracks of the original quite carefully though there are departures. The question will be how this version will stand the test of time alongside the original and the next one in line. You'll have to see them all and decide for yourself as I am whether it's worth the time and effort to wander in fields portraying a kind of innocence I doubt we'll see again.",1362787200,2,844,4.487012987012987

It's a DVD-R, pretty much what you would get from burning the film off a satellite/cable channel. The bit rate hovers around 5 MB/S, and the case suggests anamorphic in its use of the 16:9 ratio, but the image quality falls well short of a studio-produced DVD (just look at the blurry WB logo at the beginning). It looks somewhat better than a standard def TV image, but not by much, and well short of a quality DVD. It seems ironic that  Hollywood studios, who perpetually complain about piracy, would toss away their one trump card (quality) and offer a product no better than the piracy itself. Indeed, in charging more (sometimes double!) what they charge for a real DVD, they seem to have created a whole new type of piracy (in the sense of raping their customers), and a legal one at that. Even worse that WB, sitting on a vast stockpile of great films that have never been released on DVD, would insult us by doing this.",1310428800,28,1022,4.378947368421053

The movie was filmed in some of the most scenic areas of West Cork in Ireland. It's beautifully acted by a legion of young male actors and one young female. The main adult role is played by Colm Meany, well-known on both sides of the Atlantic.
  The plot revolves around the rivalry between the boys of neighboring Irish villages. Beneath this level, there's the story of teamwork and cooperation. Beneath that level is the story of pain, dealing with it and reaching out to help.

742449,4,6303954294,"""War of the Buttons"" was made in 1994.

The theme for the movie, I guess, is 'boys will be boys'
no matter where in the world they are.

This movie was filmed in Ireland and the story deals with
rivalry between two boy gangs each located in a town on
opposite sides of a river - the Ballydowse and the
Carrickdowse. The bridge separating the two has a line
drawn across the centre which marks the territorial
border for each and nobody dares cross over it.

The rival gangs taunt each other with name calling, dares
and challenges usually ending up with a battle for
supremacy.

It all appears to be good harmless fun and the perfect
occasion to let off steam and engage in a jolly good
romp. Anyone captured endures humiliation at the hands of
his captors by having all his buttons cut off and belts.
ties and shoe laces cut to pieces. It is all good fun which
occasionally gets out of hand.

The movie itself is something different and its difficult
not to become involved in its infectious and entertaining
ramblings.

742550,4,6303954294,"This film could have been a five star story had the script-writers done a better job of adapting this French tale to the realites of children in 1960s County Cork, Eire.  It's so far-fetched, that only a young American audience would be gullible enough to swallow its fantastic plot.  The script-writers did a poor job of allowing the children to be children with the values of children; instead they imposed adult values on them so that it is a film about children by adults.  Rather than do a film for children, they did a film for adults about children.  Telling is the absence of a single football throughout the film!

In short, it's the fictional confessional tale of the character Marie and her childhood growing up in a tiny village in West Cork called Ballydouse.  The plot follows the antics, at times illegal and criminal,  of two boys, Fergus and Jerome, from separates sides of the river who eventually end up in reform school - not for something they actually did, but for something they were responsible for causing (although they should have been disciplined long before things got out of hand, and would have in true life).  One of those two boys is now her husband and the other is their oldest friend.

In long, the story begins with the boys from the Ballydouse side of the river confronting the boys from the Carrick side on the bridge that connects the two.  An argument ensues with profanities unfamiliar to an American audience but very bad to an Irish one, and a Carrick boy nicknamed Gorilla grabs a Bally boy and dangles him upside down from the bridge. At any second the Bally boy may slip from the grasp of his tormentor and fall head first into the river below.  While the life of this young lad is being threatened, the post man sits in his car and only timidly advances towards the lot.  Fergus comes to the rescue, but not before Jerome (aka Geronimo) calls off the Carrick goons.

Instead of realistically running home and telling their parents how the young Bally boy was nearly murdered, the Bally boys later quietly retaliate by conducting a guerilla mission to vandalize the church in Carrick.  The destruction of private property is unsettling, especially against the church and if that really had happened in Cork, their own would of stopped them in their tracks.

During the raid on the church, one of the lads is spotted by a Carrick man.  The boy is so stunned with fear when he's seen, that he drops his basket of eggs.  The scene is humorous as he is brought inside the man's home so his wife can tend to him, and it turns out to be the home of the Carrick leader Jerome.  Jerome's father determines the boy to be in shock and funnels shots of whiskey down his throat - without any gagging, coughing, or screaming from the boy who presposterously sucks them down like a seasoned adult.  When they send him home with a basket of eggs from their hen house, he asks ""one for the road?"" in very adult and unrealistic fashion.

The next day, the Bally boys row out to the middle of the river to spy through binoculars on the efforts of the Carrick priest to repair his sign.  They are confronted with sling-shots (""catapults"") by the Carrick boys on the other side.  ""Murphy's Dunes after school"", says Fergus.

At Murphy's Dunes, the Ballys bait the Carricks with their youngest lads who taunt the Carricks into pursuing them into a trap, where the older ones capture one Carrick with a net.  It turns out to be the same kid who endangered the life of the Bally boy the day before.  In a horrible, illegal, and criminal scene, Fergus pulls out a pocket knife.  They torture the boy and threaten to castrate him.  Instead, they cut off his buttons, shoe laces, and belt.  Then send him back. Hence, the war of the buttons.

Back and forth it goes, each side taking their knives to the buttons of the other, until another very bad and unrealistic scene where the Ballys go to battle completely nude against the Carricks.  Bare-bottomed boys running around outdoors indecently exposed.  Just doesn't happen in County Cork!  Idiotic and stupid are the script-writers.  In real life, these boys (who never acted before) were actually made to indecently expose themselves for the camera people and directors filming them.  These adults should be ashamed of themselves for imposing adult humour on what otherwise would have remained a sterling coming-of-age story.

Things grow worse and worse, each side trying to trump the other until Marie is very nearly killed by an out-of-control downhill tractor.  With the destruction of the tractor and threats of lawsuits against each parent of every child that participated in the wars for buttons, each kid got a thrashing from their parent and Fergus and Jerome were sent to reform school.

Why did they do it?  ""...for the hell of it - what else is there"", explained Fergus.  With no afterschool sport, not a single football, cricket bat, or rugby ball anywhere in this film, what did the parents of this fictional village expect their kids to do?

742553,5,6303954294,"Deceptively simple.

This movie looks at adult's wars/history through the eyes of a group of Irish school children.  Historical events that they study in the classroom get re-interpreted and played out in the conflict between the two groups, leading to an escalation that *nearly* ends in tragedy.  It makes for an exploration of all that is noble and petty in any conflict, adult or child.  It deals with not only violence between the boys (and girls), but child abuse and a whole village's complicity-through-silence.  It is funny and moving and sad at times, but manages to end with good triumphing over near-tragedy.

There are a few things I would want to discuss with any kids before I watched it with them.  The first is the issue of child abuse, and the second is the nostalgic boys-will-be-boys attitude that the adults have towards their children's violence (and which permeates the film itself).  Children sensitive to death, injury or peril of characters may find the conflicts between the gangs less distressing than the child abuse and the death/injury (non-graphic) of animals.",1164758400,8,1092,5.06145251396648

742555,5,6303954294,"Another brilliant Irish film! War of the Buttons is adapted from a French book and film and is (apparently) set in County Cork, Ireland.  It centers on two rival gangs of pre-teen boys (and a few girls), the Ballys and the Carricks from neighboring towns, Bally Dowse and Carrick Dowse.  By their dress, the Carricks appear to be ""the haves"" and the Ballys the ""have nots.""  The Ballys and the Carricks each are lead by brave, honorable, respectable boys, Fergus and Geronimo; each has its own traitor/coward/bully, Riley and Gorilla, respectively.

WotB captures the adventure and fun of childhood.  While most of us didn't necessarily run in neighborhood gangs, many adults will be reminded of days spent in the woods, building forts, pretending to stage battles, exploring uninhabited areas, forming groups and following leaders.

The film is a lot of fun for kids.  Though rated PG, there is one scene in which a bunch of the boys are completely nude, their exposed behinds for all to see.  In our home, that triggered a few questions and comments from our young daugther.  Other than that and several mild curse words, WotB is kid-friendly.

More than the fun, the film teaches great life lessons.  Peacemaking, forgiveness, friendship, helping others, loyalty, bravery and honor are all major themes.  No one could possibly miss the positive messages underlying -- or taught through -- the conflict.

Not really sure what to expect, I watched it and found it to be a fantastic movie that is appropriate for all ages.  The characters in the story, especially Fergus and Geronimo, learn about friendship, betrayal, loyalty, and other qualities that make and break the Carricks and Ballys.  ""War of the Buttons"" also covers the issue of the rich/poor divide.  A victim of lost buttons and torn clothing from Carrickdowse is simply able to get a new shirt and tie, while a Bally, who cannot replace things so easily, might be punished for losing his buttons and destroying his clothes.  Fergus learns this the hard way.  However, everything seems to fall into place by the end.  The Ballys experience the joys of both victory and defeat as well as the Carricks.  Any viewer, regardless of age, should be prepared to enjoy this movie.  Have fun.  It's terrific.",1123804800,13,977,4.694117647058824
742631,5,6303954294,"Okay, so, I have to say that when I was first introduced to this movie by one of my friends, I was like, ""War of the Buttons?  What kind of a name for a movie is that?""  and was prepared not to like it.  However, I was proven to be wrong, and this has been one of my most favorite movies in a long time.  It is about two groups of boys from two different Irish towns, Ballydowse and Carrickdowse, who decide to wage ""war"" for ""the hell of it.""  If one member gets captured by an opposing team, their buttons are cut off and kept as trophies, and the victim is sent home to let ""their parents do the hurting.""  You can't help but cheer for the Ballys, who aren't as well off as the Carricks and have to be more creative in their ideas for war.  The acting is terrific, most notably the leaders of the two groups--Fergus (Gregg Fitzgerald), an abused, unloved teenager but yet has lots of spirit, who is the head of the Ballys, and Geronimo (John Coffey), the head of the Carricks, who has many noble and charismatic qualities.  To me, this movie was more than simply boys fighting each other with sticks--even though there was plenty of that--but was instead about boys growing up and finding themselves, about right and wrong, friendship, betrayal, and learning to see past senseless hate for others.  I fully enjoyed every minute of this movie--it was humoruous, yet also nostalgic and sentimental, but not overly so.  A must see, for viewers of all ages!",1073606400,48,1456,4.43984962406015

The best thing about this film is the wonderful acting of this group of mostly-unknown Irish kids. There are only 2 or 3 in the whole crowd who are veteran movie actors (you'll recognise one of the boys --""Little Con"" I think his name is??--- from Into The West.)They're funny and charming and utterly real. And as an added bonus-- Liam Cunningham, one of my all-time faves, is featured as their schoolmaster. I understand that this is a remake of a French film, and I wonder how it compares to the original. Must be at least AS good!!",1069372800,5,668,4.528925619834711

From selling the most charity tickets, to seeing who can come up with the worst cuss word, they always try to come out on top.

  War of the Buttons is a story of two groups of boys who fight with each other for each others buttons and ties and clothes.

Anybody who has played outside in the dirt with homemade swords that are made out of sticks can relate to this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a little humor in their family room.

7857161,4,6303954294,"A few years ago I saw the 2011 French Remake of an old French film based on  a 1912 French novel which is part of their curriculum by Louis Pergaud. So coming across the 1994 Irish adaptation of that novel, I decided I'd check it out.  There's actually a fair few differences to the French film so you're not just watching the same thing with Irish accents and no subtitles.  In this version kids from two rural Irish towns clash on a daily basis, but the rival town's kids are dressed like private school kids, in fact they all wear school blazers everywhere.  They probably also aren't that well off, and likely are always wearing them because the parents would have to buy other clothes for them to wear if they didn't.  But the film certainly highlights a bit of a social class divide. The french film had kids carrying wooden swords, the Irish kids just use sticks as weapons, as well as rocks and dog waste they find lying around for free obviously. Like the French film the thing kids want to do is avoid their clothes getting ruined in these battles, since their parents (in a time of physical punishment for kids, there's also a bit of domestic violence at home for some) will beat them worse than the other kids.  So obviously their aim in battle is to ruin the clothing of the opposition.  Such as cutting off the buttons, cutting belts and so on.  The town kids we follow most events through come up with an ingenious way to avoid this at one point.

Fergus the alpha boy of the poorer town plays a similar role to Lebrac in the French film, except he has both parents still alive.  There's also no war going on taking away all the older boys and adults like in the French version.  Lebrac gets a lot of detentions at school but isn't kept away from the battles to the extent Lebrac was in the French film.  Like that film his teacher is also the adult that sees potential in him and steps in against other adults from time to time on his behalf.  This film also has a main leader of the opposition kids in Geronimo who has a fair bit of the storyline, especially towards the end where a helicopter also comes into the storyline that wasn't in the French version.  Colm Meaney (Hell on Wheels) plays Geronimo's dad.  There's quite a few recognisable faces in this one, mostly from minor TV shows/movies but still you'll recognise some.",1504742400,,2347,4.438228438228438
