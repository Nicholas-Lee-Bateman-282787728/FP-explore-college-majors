8401824,2,B003P2VZ18,Rather lame instruction DVD. Definitely not worth the selling price. Go to You Tube instead.,1528243200,,92,5.2
8401825,5,B003P2VZ18,"I have to say, at first I thought this DVD seemed outdated but don't let that distract you at all. This woman knows what she is doing! My puppy has been wreaking havoc over my life lol and I've been getting really frustrated. Her techniques work, they really work! Each training segment for each command is short and easy to retain for us humans and practice with our puppies. Some techniques I thought to myself ""this will never work"" and they really worked and with fast immediate results (within a day) of constant reinforcement. I also love that it is broken down into different segments so you can just skip to the part you want to learn. I really wanted to take the time to write this review to help any other frustrated puppy parents out there. Get this DVD, worth every penny!",1491436800,2,784,4.489510489510489
8401826,5,B003P2VZ18,"Really great for anyone who wants to see positive reinforcement puppy training in action with a real-life puppy class. The DVD is better than the streaming version because it lets you navigate right to the lesson you want or to the command you want, or to the problem like jumping or barking. Streaming version has the same content but you can't skip around (at least I can't). Both versions cover everything - all obedience commands plus foolproof house training, chewing/biting, even separation anxiety.",1466899200,,505,5.096385542168675
8401827,4,B003P2VZ18,Good class but not the best I've seen.,1429142400,,38,3.875
8401828,5,B003P2VZ18,This movie is a great movie for people with their first puppy. Or even people who have had a puppy before and wished they would have done things differently. You can use these training techniques as soon as you get your puppy. As young as seven weeks old. One of the things I love about this movie is that it is a six week puppy training class that is being recorded. You get to watch the same puppies  throughout as they have learned the six week course. I have started watching this video and I haven't even got my puppy yet. I want to be ready. Training starts as soon as you get your hands on your puppy. This is also a good video if you have a dog with  minimal behavioral issues as well.,1423440000,2,693,4.125925925925926
8401829,5,B003P2VZ18,"I purchased this video to use in my training classes to help augment our other training. It is easy to understand, even for children handling dogs.  Gives another means to relay the information to people to help match their learning style.",1361404800,2,239,4.829268292682927
8401830,2,B003P2VZ18,"While the intention of this video is well founded and the director's goal worthy, the editorial and creative process was seriously lacking on the production end of this DVD.

Basically, the DVD contains mostly Puppy Kindergarten Classes.  The DVD has little to no editorial structure and specifically lacks any true ""on camera"" segments that address the viewer.  While this method could be valid for some viewers for me I found it very tiring and not worth watching.

There are other videos out there that offer information on Puppy training.  I would choose them over this one unless you don't mind sitting through this type of format.

-----

Perhaps the value of this DVD would be to introduce a viewer to what it might be like to take your dog to this particular trainer's puppy kindergarten class.  But in this case it should be offered as part of her service and not on Amazon.",1299283200,,883,4.7254901960784315
8401831,5,B003P2VZ18,Every puppy should come with a copy of this DVD.  Great video and demonstrations with real every day people and dogs who are not previously trained.  Follow this 6 week simple puppy class and you and your dog are well on your way to become a great team.,1283385600,,253,4.25
8401832,4,B003P2VZ18,Very basic and easy to follow. My daughter is using and we prefer the positive training.,1281916800,,88,4.5625
