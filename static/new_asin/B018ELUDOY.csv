7545342,5,B018ELUDOY,"Wow, good story. Anybody giving this movie less than 4 stars does not know a good movie when they see one. I gave it a five because it was different and I can relate to some of the characteristics of the story.",1469059200,,210,4.023809523809524
7545343,2,B018ELUDOY,I fast forward the whole movie. I enjoyed the scene with parents in the kitchen. A lot of drawn out scenes. Could have been better?,1467331200,,131,4.28
7545344,1,B018ELUDOY,"Who ever gave this movie more than one star had to be friends with someone making this horrible mess or not in their right mind.  I couldn't get through more than 10 minutes and had to make sure I warned anyone else who thought they should see this nightmare - I only wish there was a rating of half a star, this would be the correct rating - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1466812800,3,366,4.083333333333333

7545348,2,B018ELUDOY,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW.

Dalyboy Paul (Van Vicker) cheats on his wife (Brittany Mayti). She punishes him with an unwilling cuckold and for some reason he doesn't like it. This becomes an idiotic court case with D-Paul being represented by Miss Haiti Universe 2010 who is also a lawyer.

The plot was simplistic and so was the acting.  Originally titled ""The Heartbreaker's Revenge.""
