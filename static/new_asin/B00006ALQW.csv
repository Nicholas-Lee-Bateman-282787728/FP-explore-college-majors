7966320,5,B00006ALQW,"This DVD preserves a number of performances from French TV of the great Regine Crespin in her prime.  There are few artists as
indelible and frank as Crespin, here singing many of her signature songs and arias.  Anyone who heard her live in her prime will never forget the huge scale and voluptuous timbre of her voice, coupled with perfect diction.  She was a formidable presence on and off stage, and her double roles in Les Troyens (excerpted), her Sieglinde, Kundry, Marschallin, are high points of recorded history. She was a recitalist of wit and verve; she sang Wolf, Poulenc, Schumann--all represented here.  Without this visual remembrance, a very important side of her art would have been lost.  She was
one of the few originals; she had a talent and sensibility born of experience, both musical and from a broad engagement with life.  Watch her sing Le Spectre de la Rose from les Nuits d'ete.  She has full command of her huge, beautiful voice, of the poetry of Theophile Gautier, and she posseses a legato that is breathtaking.
Rest in Peace, Madame--La Regine National...",1440892800,,1085,4.864130434782608
7966321,5,B00006ALQW,"Regine Crespin had an enormous voice, bounded by French clarity.  Her famous diction is a lesson
to all who followed her.  I was lucky enough to see her Berlioz onstage at San Fransisco Opera, in both halves of Les Troyens, a repose sadly truncated, but with most of her music intact.  Nuits d'extases, preserved here in limited video.  Her ""Spectre de la Rose"" comes to life one more time.  Her immaculate ""Mondnacht"", so singular in her focus.  There is a world in her French training, grace under pressure...  These glimpses of her greatness will keep her alive for the few who experienced her at her apogee.",1373328000,,611,4.7075471698113205
7966322,4,B00006ALQW,"Having only heard Rgine Crespin sing in live performance at the end of her career, it is interesting to hear just what kind of a voice she had in her prime.  The CD's cover a wide span of her career and all types of opera.  It is worth listening to the CD's.",1369699200,,258,3.9423076923076925
