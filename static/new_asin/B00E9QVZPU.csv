5899365,1,B00E9QVZPU,"Two thirds of the way thru the movie, it gets stuck and does not play the video any further, You can hear the progression of the audio but not the video. Makes no never mind, as a zombie entry, it left much to be desired. Not a film worth yout time or money.",1410566400,,258,3.8867924528301887
5899366,1,B00E9QVZPU,Absolutely awful. Avoid this one like the plague. I can't begin to tell you how slow this movie is. The camera actually didn't move for the last 30 minutes of the movie. I'm not kidding.,1410480000,,186,4.3428571428571425
5899367,3,B00E9QVZPU,"Okay, I was liking it until the picture froze but the sound continued on...I'll try to see if the problem has been corrected in a few days.",1410393600,,139,4.185185185185185
5899368,3,B00E9QVZPU,"The acting was good.  I was curious about this movie and I was not disappointed.  Some of the dialogue is in English, but you have to read subtitles for English.  The movie is based on Kenny Luke's character, slowing turning into a Zombie, after he is scratched by a plant in a forrest in India.",1394496000,,295,4.327272727272727
5899369,1,B00E9QVZPU,"This movie takes SOOOOO long getting things into place for ANY kind of ""zombie"" action to take place, that I turned the movie off and then came back to find pretty much nothing had happened. There's Almost 45 minutes of this guy taking pictures and biking.  IF somebody had any credibility as a director, THEY would have severed that to maybe 5 minutes, with a little cohesive PLOT added during that time to help understand what's going on. I couldn't sit through it any longer. MAYBE it got better AFTER this guy seemed to develop this skin lesion, but, I'm not sitting through another minute...especially all the cheesy music being played as he takes all his pictures.
DON'T waste your time.",1448064000,,693,4.7272727272727275
5899370,1,B00E9QVZPU,"So this film has had technical problems now for quite a while, and they haven't bothered to fix it?  I don't think that says much for Amazon.",1445385600,,141,4.222222222222222

5899381,1,B00E9QVZPU,Terrible movie. Don't waste your time.,1427500800,,38,5.5
5899382,1,B00E9QVZPU,"Not a very good movie.  With about 40 minutes remaining in the movie, the image froze, but the audio continued.  It was pretty boring up to moment that the image froze.",1427068800,,168,4.387096774193548
5899383,3,B00E9QVZPU,"A fairly engaging effort from Bollywood about a photographer out and about in the forest who gets bitten by some insect or other. Needless to say, that's the rise of the title. Far from seeking any kind of medical attention, he lets the wound fester and it's all downhill from there.
Other than that, the video quit streaming about three quarters the way through though the audio kept playing. How can I give it three stars then? Because what I saw of it kept my attention. Maybe one day I'll come back to it in the hope that I'll be able to finish it.
Three stars is a little generous. Two and a half is better. But there is a musical interlude!",1413676800,,646,4.30327868852459
5899384,1,B00E9QVZPU,Awful awful movie. Stay away from this one.,1412812800,,43,4.5
5899385,1,B00E9QVZPU,"It was too cheesy.  The acting was poor, and the Zombies looked real fake.  I have seen better makeup at Hslloween shows.",1412812800,,121,4.454545454545454

5899387,2,B00E9QVZPU,I like the zombie movie genre but there is something wrong with this video.  It freezes up and all you can hear is the audio.  SInce the movie is in a foreign language you cannot really understand what's happening anymore since you cannot see the corresponding subtitles.  Amazon should fix this or take it off of the selection.,1412380800,,328,4.620689655172414
5899388,3,B00E9QVZPU,"this movie is ok for  two thirds of the way through. then the video freezes on one scene and the audio keeps going. at least that is what happened when I watched it. so I missed the good part with all the screaming and shouting. I could hear what was happening but all I could see was a picture of neil laying on the ground. and for the really important information, no boobs were shown.",1411171200,2,387,4.16
8603016,3,B00E9QVZPU,Was done surprisingly well. I usually dislike subtitles but this worked.,1477526400,,72,5.636363636363637
