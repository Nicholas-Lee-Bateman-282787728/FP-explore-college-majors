8424915,5,B004D8CBRK,"I've owned this workout video for a couple years now. When I first started doing the workout on 30 minutes I had to pause it between each dance because I was so worn out (at that time I was an average-bodied 21 year old 5'6"" woman weighing 146.) Immediately the next day it hurt to do EVERYTHING. I especially noticed the burn in my obliques as breathing was awful to even do haha but now, I've got a couple years under my belt and have since lost 9 pounds and had a baby girl and I LOVEEEEE this workout. I find myself craving this workout. I no longer have to take breaks to stop or even have the fan on in my bedroom to keep me cool. I still feel just as much burn today even after having done this workout for so long and knowing the next move before it comes up on the dvd, I have lent this dvd to a couple of my friends,even, and they all have really enjoyed the workout aspect but you aren't killing yourself to look great. PLEASEEEE MAKE MORE CORI ANN LENTZ!!",1385510400,,967,4.094736842105263
8424916,5,B004D8CBRK,"I read reviews about this workout, and thought I would give it a try. I love dancing, and music so thought this might be a fun one to try. I wasn't sure if this would necessarily be a ""killer"" workout like the P90X, but was hoping for a fun, quick workout where I can manage a family of four, and still get in a GOOD daily workout. This one accomplished ALL that, and more. I have to say I have not done the 60 minute workout yet, just the 30 minute. I felt results immediately after working out, not the following day like some. The workout is FUN, the music has a great beat, and the time goes by so quickly. I am a sweating mess by the end, I feel like I worked out, but had a great time with the ""girls"" while doing it. This is BY FAR the best workout I have done in a long time. Thank you Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness, for making fitness Fun and rewarding!!! A++++ Program!!!",1299628800,,875,4.0344827586206895
8424917,4,B004D8CBRK,"The DVD: Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness DVD : Volume 1

The PROMISE: The intensity of a hard core boot camp & the FUN of a Girl's Night Out!

WARNING: This may be a girly-girl workout, but it's intense. Ready? Let's get sassy!

The Workout
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Kitty-Sassy-Fitness-DVD-Video-Volume-1/dp/B004D8CBRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness DVD (Video) Volume 1</a>

Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness is a group class based out of San Ramon Valley Fitness in California, that's seemingly taking over the world. It's designed for women and combines athletic moves that target your whole body with dance & a bit of sass. It's high energy, challenging & set to club-like music that doesn't sound generic like the stuff you hear in regular DVD's. While it's fun to do alone, you might benefit (and get a better workout) by inviting a few friends over. Caution: If you are averse to girly-girl workouts, or high energy people, this may NOT be the workout for you.

HOW TO USE IT: For intense calorie burns. It's mostly cardio, but has great total body moves that target your core, buns & arms. The weighted gloves significantly increase intensity. I'd recommend sticking it on rotation as intense, interval cardio training. It's a calorie scorcher.

HIGH FIVE FOR: Some creative choreography, especially sassing up some athletic moves. Works well & is a lot of fun with the girls (or hella-amazing boys. Yes, boys can do this too. Very secure boys).

CAUTIONS & CONCERNS if... You've got injuries. There's not a lot of jumping, but it's heavy on the squats. Not much is given to you in terms of technique (hips back, knees don't go forward  etc.) and you won't be given much modification for some of the moves. Do your best, but take it down a notch & listen to your body if you need to. If you're uncoordinated, keep in mind it might take a few tries to master the moves. Start lower impact until you get the hang of it.

WINS
I kinda fell in love slowly with this workout. Honestly, when I say it's girly, it's crazy girly. At first glance, I did worry that I was going to find it a little annoying and you might feel the same way. Luckily, that proved not to be the case. My first run felt kinda sloppy (I did the 60 minute), but I was pleasantly surprised by the intensity. I wasn't expecting to push myself so hard or like some of the moves as much as I did. I like intense workouts and that's what I got. I really felt it in my glutes & inner thighs and adding the gloves really hit my upperbody & core (I used 1.5lb weights. The moves are quick, you don't need to go heavy). Once I let myself get into the music, it was a lot more fun! Cori gives you room to make the moves your own and I advise it! As an instructor, Cori Ann is upbeat and clear and the moves aren't as difficult to master as some other DVD's I've tried. When she says ""you'll get it"" she's right, even if it's not on the first try.

The second & third runs were a lot more fun. Why? Cause the girls came and did it with me! No joke, it really was a TON of fun to do with a group. The moves seemed to come alive in a different way and it's no wonder the group class is so popular. It translates well to the DVD. We did the 60 minute on one day & the 30 minute on another day.

This is a girly workout. Bright & Bubbly. If that's not your thing, you'll need to open your mind a bit or focus purely on the workout. But girly or not, it doesn't mean it skimps on the intensity. I was pleasantly surprised with the intensity of the moves & impressed with some of the combos. I liked most of the music (not ALL of it, but that's subjective) and it did help that I'm a little dance-y & athletic to begin with. I preferred the workout with the music pumped up instead: it was hard to hear otherwise (may have been my TV). The 30 minute workout is shorter than the 60 minute, but is still intense enough for days when you're short on time.

FAILS
I was able to pick up on the moves quickly because of my dance/workout background, which was a good thing because not all the moves are explained well. Most moves that I had trouble with I had to figure out on my own to get them in sync. There was also a lack of form/technique reminders, which beginners might need. This was the case when I did the workout with friends who don't share my background and I had to coach them a bit through some of the sections.

One of the girls in the video is supposed to show a lower impact version of the workout, but I didn't find this to be the case. I didn't find it ""low-impact"" as much as ""less-enthusiastic"". Modifications weren't provided for many of the moves, save the really challenging ones (like the burpees, but even the modified version was fast). Aside from that, there was no stretch after the warm-up, so keep that in mind if you're tight from a workout the day before (see tips below).

Both the 30 minute & 60 minute workout were essentially the same, so not much variety, even in terms of music. Still, I appreciated the option of having a shorter workout.
MY VERDICT

What can I say? This girly-girl liked it! I'm very much looking forward to Volume 2 (and perhaps a strength workout too? Sassy Yoga?). The workouts were challenging enough for me to feel like I got a good workout in and really fun. I did have more fun when I did it with girlfriends and it's true what they say about it being addictive. After the first few workouts, I found myself itching to do it again, which is rare for me since I get bored easily. All I need now is a pair of Hot Pink Paws. I want them SO BADLY. They're pink & shiny, I only wish they came in heavier sizes.

If you're not girl-y, I'd HATE to say skip it, but chances are you won't get past the personality of this workout. If you can handle the pink, do it! Despite shortcomings in the modifications, I'd still recommend this workout for those who are intermediate level to advanced and can modify the moves on their own. Fitness newbies should start with the 30 minute workout or maybe a less intense DVD. :)

Overall Grade: A-

Tips for this workout?

  * Stretch after the warm-up if you're tight or get your freak on & stretch before pressing play!
  * It's better with friends, especially at first. Have fun with it, invite the girls over & have a good time (and a post workout cocktail).
  * Start with no PAWS & add weights as needed. Adding the paws really boosts the intensity and while you're getting used to the moves can cause injury. Get the moves first, add light weights & move up from there.
  * Have fun with it! I had a hard time staying with the music at first, and pumping the music helped (and pumping the music didn't sacrifice instruction at all). Don't worry about being perfect, make the moves your own and have fun.
  * If something hurts, stop it. Listen to your body & practice good form. When in doubt, just shake it!",1298937600,3,8238,4.51652056641942
8424918,4,B004D8CBRK,This is a great workout DVD and well worth the money. I like that it has two workouts - both 30 minutes and 60 minutes - and the option to have the music play louder over the voice is great.  Cori Ann and her team of instructors are beautiful and are great motivation for looking good and getting fit! I got a great workout and had a lot of fun.,1298505600,,345,3.9285714285714284
8424919,5,B004D8CBRK,"Bad Kitty seriously rocks!
I looove wearing the bad kitty paws when I practice to the video
You can wear 2-4 lb ""kitty paws"" as you do the workout, and my arms are looking hot because of it!

I love the video because the music is awesome....no corny group fitness remixes
The instructors on the video are inspiring and hot! You can tell that they love the workout and it shows by their toned and tough bodies

What I like most about the video is that it forces me to workout out hard, but still feel flirty and girly!
My boyfriend loves it when I workout to the video with all the sexy moves : )

You've probably seen the ""flirty girl"" workout video collection before....seriously that kind of workout to me is lame! you don't get good results with those kind of moves
Bad Kitty has the same fun mentality, but still provides a challenge so I can change the tone of my body

I definitely recommend this video to anyone looking to switch up their routine, try something new and fun and get an awesome workout!
Buy the paws with it too : ) I wear them during my group fitness classes and people ask me about them all the time",1296345600,,1123,4.258215962441315
8424920,5,B004D8CBRK,I LOVE this video!  Five months after having my daughter I hit a plateau in my weight-loss.  I started doing Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness a few times a week and I immediately started losing weight again.  I've lost 12 pounds since starting Bad Kitty six weeks ago! It's a challenging workout-(you can definitely feel it the next day) but it's SO much fun that you barely realize you're doing work!  I HIGHLY recommend this video!,1294012800,,424,4.613333333333333
8424921,5,B004D8CBRK,"Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness is the MOST FUN I have had working out in a long time!  Some of the moves are intense, but with the great music, fun hip hop moves, and sassy encouragement from the instructors...time just flew by! The main workout runs about 55 minutes with warmup and cooldown. There is also an express 30 minute workout when you don't have time for the full hour.

Some of the choreography is simple, but some is challenging! But, they break it down and repeat moves enough that you can really get into it. Before each song Cori Ann and the other instructors breaks down one of the more complex moves...but you are still moving, exercising, and sweating the whole time! It's a great way to preview upcoming moves.

The music in this video is SO MUCH BETTER than any others I have found! It totally matched the routine. There is even a feature to ""PUMP UP THE MUSIC"" so you can hear it a little louder and the cues a little softer once you have it down. Bad Kitty Sassy Fitness is also more intense than a lot of the other videos I've tried...and way more fun!

The low impact version is definiely still high intensity! I love that. Sometimes my joints need low impact, but I still really want to know how to work a move hard so I'm getting results! They definitely show you how to do that in this video. If you're looking for an easy, low key dance style workout, this one is not for you. If you want to SWEAT and have fun, then you will love this!

Some of the moves are hard to do on carpet... and they are doing the moves on wood floor in the video. Some twisting movement that can torque your knees if you're doing them on a carpeted surface. If you have the chance, definitely do this workout on wood, tile, or linoleum and not carpet!

It is super fun, very feminine, and gets me sweating, feeling hot, and working hard each time I pop it in!",1290211200,3,1858,4.279202279202279
