1662229,5,B00005TNF1,"I happen to catch this playing in a SunCoast video store - there was crowd of people watching it around one of the ceiling monitors. What can I say? I felt like a fool standing in the middle of the mall laughing my butt off - but I had plenty of company.
It's mostly the expressions on the thumbs 'faces' that really knock me out. The dialog is pretty funny as well -  a great satire.
I'll say this - you have to like, uh, 'stupid' humor. If you find stuff like 'Half Baked' or 'Scary Movie' funny, you'll love this.
Fortunately for me. I LOVE stupid humor. This is right up my alley.",1012003200,2,584,4.12280701754386
1662230,4,B00005TNF1,"We waited a long time for this.  My wife and I absoluelty love Thumb Wars, so we were anxiously awaiting the release of the Blair Thumb.  Some truly hilaroius moments and scenes, but not quite as funny as Thumb Wars.  Still, we are dedicated ThumbFans, and will watch it again and again, maybe it will grow on us...like mold (that's good for you right? penicillan and all.)  On another note, I can't wait for Thumbtanic to come out.",1011916800,8,432,4.5
1662241,5,B00005TNF1,this is one of the funniest movies.....it's just so hilarious!!  kudo's to the people who thought these movies up!!!,1308182400,,116,5.105263157894737
1662242,5,B00005TNF1,i never knew that thumb movies existed until i ran across them on you-tube. this has to be the best thumb movie i have seen so far. i hope they create more. i just loooove jish.,1256601600,,177,3.9444444444444446
1662243,5,B00005TNF1,"When I first heard of these ""thumb"" movies, my first thought was along the lines of ""how stupid can you get?""  My second thought was, of course, ""I have to see this for myself,"" and The Blair Thumb seemed like the best film for me to start with.  There are two things you need to know about The Blair Thumb: it's short (28 minutes) and it's extremely funny.  Without a great script, this whole thing would have been a disaster.  No one wants to sit and watch a bunch of thumbs just wander into the woods and get lost.  Fortunately, these thumbs took as many classic one-liners as three thumbs could carry along for the journey.  I'm not going to say Steve Oedekerk is a genius - this is the same guy who wrote the Ace Ventura movies - but there can be no doubt that, in the world of thumbs, Steve Oedekerk is king.

You're going to need to have seen The Blair Witch Project (just the first one - I would never recommend the second one to anyone I didn't hate with every fiber of my being) in order to appreciate all of the jokes on display here, as The Blair Thumb is a true parody.  Here, Stressy, Jish, and Vic head out into the woods - after interviewing a few local thumbs, of course - to investigate the legend of the Blair Thumb.  They end up getting lost, of course, and hilarity ensues time and time again as they suffer a ""totally sharky"" night-time attack on their tent, lose Jish, and scream a lot on their way to a classic ending.

Just how realistic can a bunch of thumbs be?  You'll be surprised - I was, at least.  From their beady little eyes to their ultra-expressive mouths, these thumbs go where no thumbs have gone before.  It's the voiceovers that really make the film, though.  Megan Cavanaugh (Stressy) and Jim Jackman (Jish) are great, but Steve Oedekerk's Vic steals the whole show time and time again with some of the funniest dialogue I've heard in quite a while.

The Blair Thumb comes with a veritable cornucopia of extras - including trailers for other Thumb films, behind-the-scenes interviews with the thumb cast members, and both sane and insane commentary tracks.  Thus, despite the actual film's short running time, you still get plenty of bang for your buck with this DVD.  This is actually the second entry in Oedekerk's Thumbation film series (the first being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thumb-Wars-The-Phantom-Cuticle/dp/B00005OCKR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thumb Wars - The Phantom Cuticle</a>), and I can't wait to see the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bat-Thumb/dp/B0000687D7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bat Thumb</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thumbtanic/dp/B0000633SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thumbtanic</a>.",1239580800,,2812,5.3545454545454545
1662244,5,B00005TNF1,This movie is cheaply made but really hilarious.  There are a lot of great one-liners.,1168819200,,86,4.733333333333333
1662245,5,B00005TNF1,"Oh yes.  This is such a fantastic parody.  Ok, look, i haven't even ever seen the Blair Witch Project.  It was still outrageously funny.  You can even watch this with kids and they will find it hilarious. My whole neighborhood quotes it constantly. Do yourself a favour and plug it in.  If you don't have a diverse or even ridiculous sense of humour, if you're one of those purists that is afraid to laugh, then don't bother.  But Steve Oedekerk is a master.",1167436800,4,458,4.457831325301205
1662246,5,B00005TNF1,"First of all, I feel it best that you watch 'Blair Witch' before you see this, otherwise, this will make NO sense whatsoever.  I was (personally) glad that characters in 'Witch' were eventually got what they 'deserved' as they were incredibly annoying & needed to be b!+C#ed-slapped all over the place! (..ahem...sorry.)

As I was saying...

All the Thumb movies have proven to be great(!), and this one is NO exception!  I have been anxiously awaiting for the new Thumbshows for years now!

I think there should be shows like the PowerThumbRangers, The Incredible Green Thumb (Hulk), Gone With the Thumb, X-Thumbs, Fantastic [4] Thumbs...any many, many more.

Just don't stop.

Keep on Thumbin'!",1141084800,4,696,5.052631578947368
1662247,4,B00005TNF1,"my wife and kids seemed to like this one more than i did for some reason.

you may not like it initially but does tend to grow on you after a  few viewings.",1139097600,,156,3.696969696969697
1662248,5,B00005TNF1,I give the Blair Thumb 5 thumbs up if i had that many. I think the Blair Thumb is the best of all the thumb productions yet. All my friends watch it and sometimes it gets kinda wierd.,1057363200,,183,3.8421052631578947
1662249,5,B00005TNF1,"First of all, if you don't like this movie, your either the devil, or a stupid person who dosn't get the jokes.( Though that would be hard for someone) I was a thumb fan ever since 1999, when I first saw Thumbwars. I had memorized every line. Now, after I have seen all six thumb movies, I want more! This is a movie I watched about 500,000,000 times. Sadly, Steve Oedekerk ( The Creator) May stop the thumb movies now, or after Thumbatrix, Lord of Thumb Rings, and World Thumb Wrestling. It realley makes me mad.",1055721600,,513,4.354166666666667
1662260,4,B00005TNF1,"This movie was quite funny but wansnt as good as Thumbtanic. There are some great scenes and lines like ""Oh sure the tents safe, nothing can ever penetrate the nylon"" The ending was bad and I think they could have done better and the menu is very confusing. The extras are great with a very funny behind the scenes featurette, outtakes, deleted scenes, teasers and trailers, storyboards and a good sane commentary and a stupid insane commentary. Overall this is a great dvd for a low price.",1034208000,,490,4.64367816091954
1662261,5,B00005TNF1,"Steve Oedekerk's new obsession:  Talking Thumbs.  This is a really good spoof on the Blair Witch.  (I really liked the marshmellow scene.)
Hey, when does Oedekerk's classic ""High Strung"" come out on DVD?",1033948800,,203,5.090909090909091
1662262,3,B00005TNF1,"This is a bad follow-up to the great Thumb Wars. The jokes aren't as funny and there are some moments where nothing funny is going on at all. Not a total waste though, some parts are funny and it's better than Bat Thumb.
The DVD includes: A very funny commentary, a very unfunny insane commentary, a mock featurette, lame outtakes, deleted scenes, storyboards, and trailers for this, Thumbtanic, Bat Thumb, and the unreleased Frankenthumb.",1027555200,4,439,4.945945945945946
1662263,4,B00005TNF1,"Stressy, Vic, and Jish go out into the woods, looking for the Blair Thumb!  It's hard to tell you about it without giving anyway any details, but many of the scenes are very funny, including the night scenes.  Sometimes the characters say something that we're thinking, like ""why is it so safe IN the tent?""  They make fun of every part of the ""Blair Witch"" that didn't make much sense.  I happen to be a fan of the ""Blair Witch"" and found this to be a great(and short) parody. If it had been longer I think they might of run out of ideas. One point is taken away because I found the ending a tad weak.",1020902400,,602,4.163793103448276
1662264,5,B00005TNF1,"Nowadays, most parodies (Scary Movie, Don't Be A Menace) have been pretty much on the lame side (except when done by Leslie Neilson or anyone else who knows comedy, excluding Adam Sandler). But Thumbation produces some of the few parodies that can actually make you bust a gut in the midst of laughter.
Since ""The Blair Witch Project"" was overrated and done in a gimmicky film style (even though it's still a good film), Steve Oedekerk and the rest of O Entertainment had plenty of reason to make a parody off of it, named no other than ""The Blair Thumb"". And they did it REALLY well.
The three thumbs, Stressy, Vic, and Jish (with a character resemblant to that of Sean Penn's from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High""), have great personalities, thus enabling them to get tangled into a large number of laugh-out-loud situations. Heck, if you just look at the experssions and dialogue, you'll agree with me that you can laugh through the whole feature.
Scene pics: Jish's introduction, Vic's introduction, the townsfolk documentaries, the grocery store (""Mallow, baby!""), the redneck documentary (""Twins should look alike!"")...........From there, the gags never stop!
The bottom line is that ""The Blair Thumb"" is a shining moment in parodies that NO comedy fan should be without. It is witty, fast, and undeniably hilarious (at a short 28 minutes. But hey, its a great 28).",1020470400,,1369,4.93073593073593
1662265,2,B00005TNF1,"This was a big disappointment after Thumb Wars, which is enjoyable everytime I watch it.  While Thumb Wars had me laughing almost the whole way through it, Blair Thumb only had a few funny moments.  Maybe if you're a *huge* fan of The Blaire Witch, you'll find this worthwhile.  Otherwise, skip it.
Hopefully Thumbtanic will be better...",1016582400,4,337,4.87719298245614

If you like to quote movies than this movie is perfect for you!! There are great scenes like the thumb redneck scene, ""Tell em' what you heard!"" and of course, the panic scene, ""aawww SPIT man!! aaawww spit!""
This is even better as a DVD because of it's special features. Its got deleted scenes, upcoming thumb movie trailers and a whole lot more!!!",1016150400,2,501,4.397849462365591

Sometimes i recreat sceens with my own 2 thumbs, but it will never be as good as The Blair Thumb. I can't wait till Bat Thumb and Thumbtanic. I only wait and bed staring at the ceiling praying till there released. All i want is a Thumb Turtles.",1015718400,,349,4.147058823529412
1662268,5,B00005TNF1,"Ok, this is a funny film. It gets funnier every time I see it.  Classic lines like ""Mallow""  and ""Totally Sharky...complete"" are now part of my hilarious movie quotes.

Those are great,but if you're like me you'll buy this anyway to complete your collection. Which i agree with,looks good on the shelf,but not on the screen. Watched it once,and completely regreted it.

This movie is jammed will all kinds of humor and you don't even need to see the Blair Witch to understand it. I didn't see Blair Witch til about last year and well...yeah but this is absolute comedy gold. SEE THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN",1361491200,,414,4.175
