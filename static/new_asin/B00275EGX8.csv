3859344,4,B00275EGX8,"A war film unlike any other, The Hurt Locker examines a group of Army bomb squad soldiers in Iraq and the extreme toll the horrors of war and the debilitating awareness of imminent death takes on their lives. Incredibly suspenseful from the start, the pressure and paranoia to get the job done never lets up, and though the balance between realism and personalized fiction seems to shift more towards the latter further into the turmoil, few films can boast war scenes of such a gloriously intense magnitude.

After the leader of an Army bomb squad unit in Iraq is tragically killed, brash-but-experienced bomb technician William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace his command. His new squad includes Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty); the trio must learn to trust each other through their various, always perilous missions, constantly coping with the daily reminders of the fragility of human life and the infinite dangers surrounding their every move.

""War is a drug"" states the opening quote by author Chris Hedges. That idea isn't fully revisited until the conclusion when The Hurt Locker resorts to being a mouthpiece for soldier's mentalities, the regimentation of their lives and their inability to reinsert themselves back into the world they knew before. It seems an unnecessary effort, considering the incredible amount of raw suspense and nail-biting action that drives the majority of the film. It's a small dose of political agenda, leaving the rest to be solidly entertaining, proving once again that director Kathryn Bigelow can handle action movies like the best of them.

The Hurt Locker is partly a biopic of a fictionalized EOD specialist, and part pseudo-documentary about a tension-wrought Bravo Company 40 day rotation. Instead of focusing on a story arc that separates specific villains and related events, the film chronicles several unrelated bomb missions and the tolls they have on fellow soldiers, Iraqi citizens and James' beliefs and methodology. Without catching those responsible or even hunting specific terrorists, The Hurt Locker relies on tremendously powerful imagery, adrenaline-fix recklessness, mental stresses and an obsession with death, heart-stopping explosions, camaraderie, Full Metal Jacket-influenced commanding officer execution thoughts, and enough suspenseful intensity to level a movie theater. It's borderline humorous the way Bigelow toys with the audience, setting up extreme anticipation for the next detonation or ambush, pouncing on the viewer's senses like a horror film.

Being a bomb squad technician is like a roll of the dice, a high-pressure, high-stakes risk that demands a sound mind and a dizzyingly calm intelligence. There is no room for error, and actor Jeremy Renner provides a believable hero - one who demonstrates a daredevil disregard for protocol and safety that might just be a mask for a man whose perfectly-honed skills are the mark of an uncompromising professional. The supporting cast is superb, as are the sound effects and numbingly immersive camerawork. Witnessing a different side of the Iraqi war zone, a modern battlefield, coupled with real-life sacrifice and heroism is powerful, alluring, and eye-opening entertainment.

3859345,4,B00275EGX8,"This is a very particular and full of personality film about an american  group that disarms bombs in the desert wars. The film is tense, hard, dry like the sand. In the most part of it you watch the group in action, even when there is not much action, but there is tension always ! The actors and the great director (K-19, Strange Days)  made a good job, transmiting a real feeling as you were there, questioning yourself about the stupidit of any kind of violence against people. Very well done tecnically and a with a great video quality, considering what DVD can delivers to you. In Blu-ray I think it will be fantastic !!! And to be honest ... the industry could stop to make DVD. Let's Blu-ray !!! Now !!!

OBS: I am including an observation in this review today (01/17/2010)... I don't care if The Hurt Locker will win anything in Oscar or something like this ... Is it better than Avatar? Come on! Avatar is just and only visual effects with bad acting, weak direction, superficial emotions ... The Hurt Locker deserves our admiration because it's a great film and just not a product like Avatar, Star Trek, Twilight, etc...",1240704000,,1138,4.546341463414634

3859411,1,B00275EGX8,"Agonizing. My brain is actually numb from my mind screaming at this pure unadulterated stupidity.

I could barely stay awake except for the the nonstop foolish actions of the characters managed to keep me on the edge of my seat, wondering when they would get a hole blown through their own head doing something dumber than the previous Darwin victim.

Example; lets wear this 150 lb hot and heavy bomb suit that slows a guy down to a crawl and cant even keep him alive outside of the 25 meter ""kill radius"" of an explosion. Also, don't bother to shoot the guy with the Det-phone, ever. It's better to try and sprint 200 yards shouting at the insurgent to stop being mean, who just looks at you and dials the call button anyway. Boom.

Next we should just let a crazed manic-suicide driver roll through the platoon unchecked and then after giving him every chance possible to make a mess of everyone, lets just have an hour long point blank standoff between a sidearm, a potential car-bomb and a guy who won't blink with a gun to his suicidal head, then let's make him back up into your entire squad with the suspected car bomb. Genius.

It gets better.

When a sniper shoots a guy in the road, everyone runs away from cover for a full 90 seconds, all just running in circles. Then one soldier decides to try counter-sniping but just sat in plain view firing pot shots that basically miss the entire building the enemy was hidden in, let alone anywhere near the enemy insurgent firing on them. Dude promptly gets shot through and through as expected. So what happens next? The other brave soldier takes up the exact same position in plain view of the enemy sniper, and stays there without any ammunition and a jammed rifle... waiting for his incompetent team to bring him a bullet; while just sitting out in plain view in the exact spot the enemy sniper had just dialed in a kill-shot on his comrade. Bravery at its finest.

I could go on. I'm sure it's all intentional to make the movie as much of a thriller as possible, along with the extra shaky camera footage of grown men casually strolling around in no hurry at all. It's just not for me.",1527206400,5,2144,4.484615384615385

No way that would fly in real life.  They would have kicked his ass into gear or thrown him overboard, they can't have a little boy guarding their six, nope.

This one seems very far from the reality that people who have been there express to me when they talk about their experiences.

The Hurt Locker. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow in 2008. You have most likely heard about it but have you experienced it? Its a modern war movie that everyone should see at least once. The premise is straightforward.

""The Hurt Locker"" follows three soldiers in the Iraq War that are part of the explosive disposal team. The movie puts the viewer on the dangerous ground level with the team. The team consists of  Sergeant First Class William (Jeremy Renner),Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldrid (Brian Geraghty).

The story is a war adventure stream of conscious. The team lives and experiences the dangers of war. They are all human and reckless in their own way. The film explores the drive for war and how some are drawn to the danger. It also has parallels to everyday like and how teams and people interact under pressure.

They even showed the dark side of the U.S military (to be fair, group of individuals) at moments and the flaws of the soldiers instead of ""the U.S army is always right and each death brought by us is justifiable"" route some movies can't go without. Almost every moment is tense and it didn't have to use cliche ""action"" music or explain the situation at hand, leaving some interpretation. Another thing done extremely well are the deep themes and complex characters. I didn't think they'd explore out of the ""war is hell"" mantra but they went through deep unique things like how sergeant James was addicted to adrenaline and outside of the army was too bored and came back. There are other lovable characters and isn't he isn't the sole reason this movie is great.

3859709,3,B00275EGX8,"This is a movie about a bomb technician, Sergeant William James , whose talent for defusing every kind of bomb in the Middle East reaches epic proportions.  He is hailed by his superiors as extraordinary- but the men who work with him can't decide if he is a terrifyingly dangerous adrenaline junky or merely the bravest man they ever met.  The film does a good job of letting us decide which.  This movie gives us a great insight into the new battlefield- urban warfare and what it means for our fighting men and women.  It also shows the tension of fighting a war for people who don't see us as their saviors.  Indeed, they seem to think of us as interlopers.  Again, the film does a good job of showing the psychological effect of this on our soldiers.  The set, the gear and the wardrobe of the soldiers and 'extras' is completely and utterly genuine (although I'm not sure that Humvees have plywood on the inside!  lol).  The biggest problem I have with this film is that I never really connect with the main character.  I watch him throughout the film and he is flat, unknowable and unemotional.  Even in the end, his choice concerning his family (vs. the conclusion reached by his squadmate, Sergeant Sanborn) was disappointing and almost unbelievable.  I couldn't see the point of the film- or the message.  It neither showed the glory of war nor the ugliness of it.  It didn't show man's degradation under war, nor his ability to find redemption or higher purpose within war's degradation.  Due to this lack of core message and any ability to reach me emotionally, I can only give an otherwise well made movie a three star rating.",1497225600,3,1639,4.603448275862069

3859795,2,B00275EGX8,"Unlike the Oscar Academy and countless other award organizations, I found this movie to be rather pointless. A mish-mash of scenes from a psuedo-military diary, counting down the days for their deployment to end.  Other than that, zero plot. Zero back-story. Zero character development. Some gung-ho cliches which denigrate our military and make them seem like cartoon characters overlaid on TONS of totally misinformed tech about what the military does with un-detonated bombs.  I'm not even in the military and I could see the flaws all over the place. (One of the most glaring errors being the incident of a soldier pulling up bombs by their wires. Any one of them could be rigged with mercury-connecting motion sensors that would detonate immediately.) Sad that this piece of entertainment passes for a good film. I am only giving it two stars because there were a few scenes of good acting, but what can the actors do other than what is scripted? This is not a good war film, it's a staged insult to our vets and those who currently serve. And seriously, isn't the era of shaky camera techniques over with???",1482537600,,1113,4.852631578947369

Mackie's character in the end says: ""I need a son."" For what? To go die in a war? Renner's character is not the wild renegade the reviews make him out to be, but he is a typical war film protagonist of the post-Vietnam War era - he doesn't care about politics, he does it because...because...well, he ""has"" to...You insult intelligent viewers, or anyone who has a clue about how we got into these Gulf Wars.

The movie follows three members of Bravo Company's Explosive Ordanance Disposal (EOD) squad, as they struggle to finish the last few days of their year long tour of duty. Everyone copes differently; Specialist Eldridge (Geraghty) is overwhelmed at times with the death that surrounds them, Staff Sergeant James (Renner) is addicted to the rush of battle, and Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie) supports James as best he can. James is a complex, fascinating and tragic character; he's extremely competent, yet eccentric and even reckless to the point where his teammates consider fragging him in order to make it back alive. In a thoughtful gesture, he respects the work of his adversaries and keeps all the trigger mechanisms of bombs he has defused in the past.",1474675200,3,897,4.947019867549669

But as a Dutchman living in the US, I do honestly feel that this movie is overrated due to American sentiment. The movie has a lot of clich&eacute; and a lot of things are predictable. Most of these movies are the same story about some 'super soldier' doing exceptional things with some rivalry that turns into friendship, some weak dude who needs help from the super soldier, some super nice guy dying, some kid getting blown up and making the super soldier sad and a lot of bro-talk about how war is unfair and you shouldn't think about the politics of war. From a different perspective I could say: it illustrates the American emotion and excitement around war pretty well.

3860149,2,B00275EGX8,"I finished viewing this movie last night, and found it largely mediocre. I'd read a few articles online, and overheard television shows in years prior in which combat veterans decried the depictions of soldiers in the film but found it didn't adversely affect my viewing experience. However, there was a scene early in the movie where one soldier punches his superior officer which took me out of the moment: I thought, ""Surely that doesn't happen on a daily basis among individuals who place their trust in each other to better be able to remain living."" Further, I wasn't as impressed by Jeremy Renner's performance as I hoped to be based on the last role in which I saw him: ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"". On occasion, I ask myself if I accept movies as works of art then I must consider whether the purpose of art is to reflect life or simply to allow a momentary escape from it. If ""The Hurt Locker"" is a reflection of daily life for the modern soldier, it seems as if their job is as monotonous as work might be for many people. If the purpose of ""The Hurt Locker"" is to allow a respite from reality for a chance at entertainment, it fails; I didn't care about any of the characters and was struck at the conclusion of the movie only by the question, ""How much can I get for this Blu-ray once I sell it?""",1452643200,,1341,4.411290322580645

If you've watched Generation Kill or Band of Brothers, this movie will be loaded with unintentional comedy.

Maybe I'm being a bit harsh since I just finished rewatching Band of Brothers the previous week before watching this? In Band of Brothers, I saw guys putting everything out on the line for one another and working as a team and were in deed, like a band of brothers. In The Hurt Locker, I saw Jeremy Renner's lone wolf flashy cowboy character framed as a hero figure. Renner's character was a kind of play by his own rules, damn the rest of my squad/team, disrespect your commanding officer hotshot soldier and the kind of crap his character was pulling off was what would get other squad members, including himself, killed.

It wasn't until viewing the Academy's best picture of 2010, The Hurt Locker, that I started to see things differently. In these films, it's not so much the story line that matters, but rather the characters that are featured in the film. The description of The Hurt Locker is just as bland as any other war picture, the story of a unit in Iraq that is responsible for disarming explosives. What makes this film so unique and made it the best film of 2010 was William James, played remarkably well by Jeremy Renner. Renner is known as an action star, so when I saw him nominated for best actor, I couldn't believe it. The truth is Renner's performance in this film was outstanding, because for once, he simply played himself. Renner may have been portraying a Sargent in Iraq, but the personality was his own. Director, Kathryn Bigelow, has become known for letting actors be themselves in developing their characters personalities, to the point where even some of the dialogue was in the spur of the moment. The Hurt Locker is a powerful film, with remarkable events and heartbreaking moments, but it's the films personality that is larger than life.

Craving a military life is distinct from one having a preoccupation with constantly being exposed to potentially deadly life scenarios. ""Lifers"" have common sense. That's why so many live to enjoy retirement.  I don't know what the producers had in mind, but ""recklessness"" and ""bravery"" are mutually exclusive. I have known brave soldiers. None were reckless. Love the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack of ""Hurt Locker"".",1448496000,,623,5.048543689320389

3860217,4,B00275EGX8,"There's not much to say about a film that's been reviewed more than 1,000 times.  I'll concentrate on the creation that is the Staff Sergeant James character, in that his personality is central to the film.  He is described by more than one person as a 'wild man.'  I contend that 'wild man' and bomb-defuser is a highly unlikely combination.  A bomb-defuser must, necessarily, be meticulous and obsessive yet, in at least some scenes, James is rather opposite.  I'll draw your attention to the ridiculous scene in which James and the black character are 'getting it off' by punching each other as hard as they can in their bellies 'for kicks'.  This would be highly unlikely behavior for members of a bomb squad and even more unlikely for James, the bomb defuser, himself.  A man like this would protect his ability to perform his function and smashing each other in the belly could easily compromise the fine motor and other traits necessary to defuse bombs.

So, let's take James in another direction, perhaps a direction that the director and producers didn't intend.  James is no wild man.  He is obsessive-compulsive to the point of clinical neurosis.  He lets NOTHING get in the way of his job, not even the lives of his other crew members.  He is focused.  He is 100% concentration.  He throws away his headphones should the messages interfere with his mission.  He is dedicated and proud of his work to the point of mental pathology.  There is the death factor so he keeps fuses under his bed to remind him--and stimulate him--as to the thrill, risk and obsession of his mission.but.he's not a 'wild man'.

The scene with the snipers is unlikely but interesting.  As the British squad is slaughtered around them, the black guy picks up the sniper rifle with Sgt. James as his spotter.  We have no reason to believe that they are trained snipers but they have no alternative.  The range, I believe, is given as 350 meters which, for trained snipers, is a close dead shot.  Several times, however, the black guy sniper completely misses his mark by 15 meters or so.  Not only is no sniper, he is a terrible shot.  Still they play the scene as if the target were over 1,200 meters away.  With the help of the James, observer, he 'zeros in' and makes some excellent shots, especially when he blows the head of the enemy sniper as the enemy combatant is running.  Not likely.  Extremely unlikely.  What does smack of the truth, though, is James.  As observer, a man who needs to stay intense on the potential target, he is the most important part of the team.  The shooter can rest his eyes but the observer cannot.  James remains the central focus.",1446249600,,2653,4.655172413793103

3860219,4,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker"" is a rare war film done by a female director named Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron's ex wife. Bigelow has directed a war film about a team dismantling bombs in Iraq. Jeremy Renner leads the squad and his character has a record of dismantling bombs. Renner is terrific as the leader. His performance can be difficult to watch at times. He deserved his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The rest of the cast do award winning performances as well.

The film has difficult scenes to watch for the squeamish. War is hell onscreen and offscreen but you can't help watching this film. It is bleak but not hopeless. They filmed Iraq scenes in Jordan. The film is about two hours long but engrossing to watch in that span. The film won 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Bigelow was the first female to win this award.

In fact, Bigelow is my kind of female director. She does difficult topics like war rather than traditional female subjects. It is nice to see a female director in charge for a change and win accolades for it.

My biggest complaint is the lack of features for this DVD. There is only one feature behind the making of the film.",1445644800,,1184,4.5754716981132075

3860276,4,B00275EGX8,"I thought I'd seen every Iraq-Afghan era movie made, until I happened to catch this on TV last week: back-to-back. After watching it twice, I immediately logged onto Amazon to purchase the DVD.

After enjoying a full season of a reality-docu-drama show on TV following the ""daily life"" of an EOD team, I was hooked on the suspense, and more so on the portrayal of the nerves of steel EOD specialists possess.

This movie was non-stop EOD action.
A real nail-biter.
But it also exposed the humanity these men possess.
It would be so easy to just fire a 9mm point-blank at a seemingly suicidal-crazed cabbie.
It would be even easier to let a ""family man"" strapped with an explosives-vest blow-up... to not even TRY to free this man.
But in both these cases, and in others, control prevailed, cocmpassion reigned.

There's a lot packed into these 2:10.
But the viewer is left with even more when the film is over.

Although a USAF Veteran, myself, I can't begin to imagine what it is like for these brave men to live and breathe EOD everyday--- to leave the safety of their quarters with full knowledge that each day may -- and probably will --- be their last.

Excellent fillm. Highly recommended.

3860551,5,B00275EGX8,"Of the relatively few movies that deal with America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, ""The Hurt Locker,"" starring Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty, is clearly the best.  It is beautifully written by Mark Boal, expertly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and marvelously acted by a strong ensemble cast. It won the 2010 Academy Award for Best Picture.

""The Hurt Locker"" follows a fictional three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team, whose job it is to disarm improvised explosive devices (IEDs) left behind by enemy insurgents.  As our story opens, the three members of this particular EOD team have only 38 days to go before their rotation in Iraq ends and they can return to the United States. On this 38th day before their tour ends, tragedy suddenly strikes the team. Their well-liked team leader is killed while attempting to neutralize an IED concealed in the middle of a busy Baghdad street.

The team leader is quickly replaced by Sergeant First Class William James (Renner), who appears to be as technically competent as his predecessor. But he also appears to have very poor leadership and  ""people"" skills. He is very much a loner. He relegates team members Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie) and Private Eldridge (Geraghty), to routine guard duty while he alone does the ""dirty work"" of disarming bombs.

Sergeant James continually exhibits a reckless disregard for his own safety and the safety of his teammates. During their first two operations together, James fails to follow established procedures or keep in constant communication with his teammates, thereby exposing all three of them to unnecessary physical danger.

At first, Sanborn and Eldridge are resentful of James, almost to the point of mutiny. Gradually, however,  these three individuals, each possessing such different sets of ambitions, attitudes, and priorities, begin to work together.  Will they be successful at forging an effective team during the short time they have remaining in Iraq? How will they react as external and internal tensions mount  in the days to come? Watch this outstanding film to find out!

It's difficult for me to find enough superlatives to do complete justice to ""The Hurt Locker.""  Screenwriter Mark Boal, who won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award for this film, deserves tremendous credit for writing such a tense and thrilling story.

""The Hurt Locker's"" ensemble cast is magnificent. Jeremy Renner, Academy Award-nominated for his role as Sergeant James, Anthony Mackie, as J.T. Sanborn, and Brian Geraghty all truly deliver the goods in their roles as members of Bravo Company EOD Team trying to make sense of their surroundings in the midst of war.

""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the best films about war in recent years - tense, engrossing, well acted, written, and directed; and great entertainment from beginning to end. Highly recommended!",1426377600,,2876,5.196969696969697

I bought it for my grandkids so they had more of a view of how our military sacrifices to keep us safe  These days I don't think they have any idea of what kind of conditions they are exposed to or that our enemies will even sacrifice their own people for the win. they are under some illusion that be all you can be means you will be sent to Hawaii or Germany to have fun. Or the job they give you will be at a desk taking calls. I want my grandkids to know that these brave men and women are out there in foreign countries while they leave their families behind and risk their lives for them to have the right to go to school and make decisions. They need to know that this is not a fight on the game boy and real people get killed or maimed. How do you fight an enemy that are all dressed the same and you have to make a decision weather or not this is a bad guy? Thanks to all of our armed forces for you service!,1424908800,2,930,3.8947368421052633

3860621,2,B00275EGX8,"When The Hurt Locker won both Best Picture and Director (a first for a woman) there was controversy whether it was the Academy's way of getting back at James Cameron--some feeling he was too confident in expecting to win a second Oscar for Avatar. Hurt Locker never came to a theater near me and I never had a chance to see it. I asked someone about it who said, ""It wasn't a good picture--nobody saw it."" I decided to see it for myself and found it available on Amazon. Before watching it I had looked it up online and critical reviews for it were very good, including The New York Times. They all praised Mark Ruffalo for his work in it. One critical review said that the reason few saw it was because it came out in March, a year ahead of the Oscars, Hollywood was going through a  liberal, anti-war moment, and many theaters were afraid to book it because it was too violent. They seemed to be saying that it earned the Oscar. I now anticipated a movie more in the line of American Sniper--which I liked primarily because of Bradley Cooper. After viewing Hurt Locker I am sorry to say I did not like it, did not see much to it as to dialogue, plot, did not stir my emotions--even Mark Ruffalo's acting did not affect me like I had anticipated. I have to agree that Hollywood and powerful critics were not fair to Cameron.",1424390400,,1325,4.342741935483871

3860657,4,B00275EGX8,"THE HURT LOCKER is a tense but emotionally distant war film from director Kathryn Bigelow, and starring Jeremy Renner. It follows an Army bomb disposal unit around as they do their job in war-torn Iraq. Unlike most war films it doesn't really take a stance on whether or not we should even be there, instead focusing on the psychology of warfare and what it does to the human mind. I thought that this approach mostly worked, although it kept the audience at a certain distance emotionally from the characters. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner, and he is the sergeant in charge of the unit. He is brash, reckless and one could almost say he has a death wish. What is closer to the truth is that he just loves what he does, and the thrill he gets from doing it. Also in his unit are another sergeant and a specialist played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, respectively. They serve as counterpoint to Renner's character, and as a rational check against his unbridled nature. While most of the film deals with their bomb-defusing exploits, there are some moments when the true ugliness of the Iraq War shows its face, such as a tense nighttime scene in which Renner's character stalks someone he thinks is responsible for the death of a young street vendor he met. He ends up in the wrong place and just leaves before the situation escalates. It is in moments like that where the film hints at a possibly deeper reading of the film in terms of whether we should have even been in Iraq in the first place. That being said, the film is well-acted by everyone involved and the handheld cinematography worked in its favor, putting the viewer into the heat of the situations that arose. I guess my biggest gripe would be that it never explicitly challenges American presence in Iraq, but it's not necessarily a film's job to do that for you. With what it portrayed, and who the main character was, it still allows you to draw your own conclusions. For one, it must take a special someone to be a bomb disposal expert. And also, not everyone is cut out for combat. Overall, THE HURT LOCKER is a solid piece of filmmaking and an interesting look into modern warfare.",1423267200,,2175,4.565217391304348

3860707,2,B00275EGX8,"How on Earth did this tosh beat Avatar in the Oscars? I can only think that the Oscars panel suffered from a complete lack of imagination and were politically motivated to publicise a film portraying heroic American troops bravely imposing Western democracy (and defending American oil interests, obviously) on another Middle Eastern rabble. There's nothing here we haven't seen before, from the jerky headache inducing hand-held camera, through the formulaic tortured navel-gazing of individuals, to insubordinate and ill disciplined (I suppose they prefer the word `maverick') American troops. And, as if that weren't enough, there's a little comedic light relief when Bravo Company stumble across a group of British mercenaries who, through their own carelessness, obviously, either end up dead or cowering behind our brave American heroes.

On the plus side, the story bowls along at a reasonable pace most of the time (although there's no plot to speak of) and there are some good action sequences.

To summarise, this is a reasonably entertaining, though somewhat overlong, utterly unoriginal and unexceptional film. I'm just glad we only borrowed it.",1420934400,,1157,5.4581005586592175

3860788,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker
 `The Hurt Locker' is as close to being a perfect movie as we have seen.  It will be regarded in the history of the Cinema as the greatest war movie ever made.  Is it greater than `All Quiet on the Western Front' or `Bridge on the River Kwai' or `Saving Private Ryan'?  Yes, by a nose, but definitely yes.
 The film is made in a documentary style with much of it done in extreme close ups.  The action is relentless from the first moments as we watch from a robot's perspective as it trundles to the site of an improvised explosive device until the last mission is over.  This is as close to feeling what it is like to be in combat as an armchair soldier can get.  It is innovative, shocking, inspiring and amazing.
 The characters are members of a three man team who are experts in dismantling bombs, IEDs and unexploded ordinance.  Two team members react to the stress of war with typical human emotions.  They are frightened, disgusted, feel the call of duty to their teammates and their country and are outstandingly brave.  The team leader thrives.  He has faced instant annihilation literally hundreds of times and can't keep himself away from repeating the experience.  He is hooked, his Jones is catastrophic danger.
 The actors, unknowns save for a cameo by Ralph Fiennes, are not given windy speeches.  They are soldiers; we know them by their acts.  This is director Kathryn Bigelow's movie and she puts it right over the left field fence and into the upper decks.
 R rated for language (combat soldiers) and realistic violence this two hour and 10 minute movie is like a strip mall diamond, flawless unless you use a jeweler's loop.  The sound track is Palestinian Heavy Metal.  `Hurt Locker' earns an outstanding 4 and a half saw blades.",1415750400,,1766,4.617363344051447

Jeremy Renner delivers a character filled with layers, and he does so with deceptive ease.  I learn more about his Sergeant First Class William James with each viewing.  For those who have not yet viewed this film, I won't give actual spoilers, but will say Renner's portrayal of James shows us a character who appears one way but due to inner conflict, is actually the (almost) polar opposite of what he appears.

I recommend the viewing since it displays the complexity of the psychological effects of stress both on the individual soldier as well as his team, especially when one of the EOD team turns out to be a fearless risk-taker.

3860860,5,B00275EGX8,"This is a straight up movie about an EOD unit operating in Iraq, highlighting much of the same dangers found on todays anti-terrorism battlefields. The worry and suspense are well done, and the movie shows some of the strange things that do happen in ""the sandbox"". The onlookers looking to put a few clips up on Youtube - are they just innocent bystanders or are they part of a setup?

The movie shows a few EOD guys with different personalities, and it reminded me of some of the folks I ran across - EOD is one of those jobs that there really isn't much demand for outside of a few state or federal agencies, so the military folks who go in for this job don't have many career paths to look forward to in the future, and the movie kind of shows this. It also shows some of the tough life or death calls that the soldier on the ground has to make. A lot of folks don't realize that the military has rules of engagement that they have to follow, and some of the rules sound good on paper until you see how they can affect a real situation. But the alternative might be the killing of some innocent civilians.

I didn't feel there was any particular agenda being put forward with this film - to me it came across as more of a documentary, or commentary on the life of today's soldiers. In that I found it accurate and entertaining at the same time.",1402444800,,1348,4.26171875
3860861,5,B00275EGX8,"This movie is profound on so many levels it's even hard to summarize.  Most importantly, it allows the viewer to decide what these men, under intense stress and then enormous release - day after day - are thinking and feeling.  There's not a lot of talk, and there's really not a lot of action, either.  All the tension is expressed through the quiet, relentless behavior of (primarily) only three men.

You cannot watch this movie and not spend days thinking about how men react to the stress (and boredom) of war, how they relate to each other, what war means (or how stupid it is - or how exciting - or how crazy - or how important), how different they are from one another.  It goes on and on.  Hard to imagine how a screenwriter and director could pack such power into a movie with virtually no plot and no particular story arc.

Kathryn Bigelow spent a great deal of time at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia in consultation with CIA bigwigs in preparation for ""Zero Dark Thirty"", and the then-CIA Director (from 2009 to 2011) Leon Panetta took an intense personal interest in the production of ""Zero Dark Thirty"". The US propaganda movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was essentially a CIA production. Reference: ""Seal Target Geronimo"" (2011) by Chuck Pharrer.

Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) features a ridiculous sub-plot about Iraqi insurgents surgically implanting bombs inside people's abdomens in back-alley kitchen-table operations. The reality is that no one would be likely to survive such amateur surgical abdominal operations, but after the release of ""The Hurt Locker"" film the US Government has been warning the public that people carrying surgically-implanted bombs constitute yet another terrorist threat. It's another false threat invented by the US Government to frighten the public and promote the bogus War on Terrorism. The false threat of surgically-implanted bombs provides an excuse for Homeland Security's full-body X-ray scans of boarding passengers at US airports.

Most of what we have been told by the Media and by the US Government about Osama bin Laden, his career, and his death, is probably fictional propaganda.",1391644800,3,1532,5.379166666666666

Having been in the Infantry, and later Spec Ops, I can tell you with all certainty, you will NEVER see the Infantry cowering in alley ways while EOD shows up to the rescue. You will however see the Infantry pulling security in the most blatant show of force possible, along with Armour. Not to slam EOD, as they are pretty damned couragious, they are a support element, not a front line combat soldier. To depict them as some sort of skin of their teeth rambo organization is pure fantasy.

As for the sniper scene. Very well done from the actual sniper perspective, however there isn't a chance in all that is holy that an EOD guy would be able to pick up the rifle and get down to work. Just because you are sitting behind the rifle doesn't mean you're going to hit anything. There is a reason sniper school is one of the most difficult schools in the military. Or to quote one of my instructors, you need to learn the, ""Geometry of Death."" Its not a simple point and shoot type of gig there are just to many variables to take into account especally for someone who isn't a sniper. Its an extremely specialized profession.

My son was there in 2004 on a four person special ops team so this (I think) is as close as I will ever come to seeing what he experienced daily for a year. It is very well made and I did not notice the ""shaky"" camera work that some have mentioned. I don't know if it was technically perfect, but it gave a good peripheral view into what ""going on a mission"" means for a three or four person team riding in a Stryker vehicle through streets where - any person could be the one that takes your life. The emotional connections to one another and some of the Iraqi population are played well. The decision to pull the trigger or not and the long term stress of that daily consideration come through in this movie loud and clear. Even toward the end the mundane decision of picking out cereal juxtaposed to what the soldiers go through while in Iraq (including the life and death decisions) was well placed. I thought it an excellent movie about the stress of being a soldier.",1385769600,9,1050,4.255

I had read great acclaim in the Times of the picture's realistic portrayal of contemporary disputes, and eagerly wished to observe the experience many of the townspeople have had while defending our great empire. I must say, I do not agree with he writing for the Times. I know with certainty that this picture is but the flight of fancy of another flippant motion picture director, as my cousin, Lord James T. Brewster, has traveled to the far reaches of our wide empire and met men in all stages of conflict. Motion picture directors have been too long exploiting the terrible desire held by many to see our fellow man hurt in new ways. The film featured outlandish technology and dishonorable strategy wreaking havoc upon characters for whom we are made to develop great sympathy.  I, for one, find this an outrage. Ms. U-------- was quite distressed by the picture's content as well.

I heartily discourage you from viewing this motion picture and incentivizing the creation of such films in the future.

3860992,4,B00275EGX8,"Remember that John Lennon lyric?  That probably came to him with Vietnam in mind.  I was old enough to be drafted by the end of that war.  Went from being classified 1A to 1H (holding) as the draft and that war wound down.  I always wondered if I would have survived.  Movies like this and Platoon and Saving Private Ryan always remind me of that and just how much I hate everything to do with war and what it does to families.  It reminds me how democracy and a free press ended that conflict as public outcry eventually won, and it makes me wonder where that free press is during this war.  It reminds me that 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes pegged our species more than any other in that he stated that we are mostly given to selfishness and violence in our most natural state.  We hardly attain the youthful age of twenty before we're ready to kill.  And something as simple and arbitrary as beliefs, religious and cultural, neither of which are valid reasons, are all it takes to justify the violence in our minds.

This movie, like all Hollywood movies, can only be expected to be technically accurate up to a certain point . . . After all it is a movie and not a documentary.  But it was real enough to bring all of that to mind.  It reminded me how our patriotic youth trust both the people in this country and our government to consider their welfare above everything else before putting them in harms way.  But I always have doubts about misplaced trust.  In Alan Greenspan's book he declares that the current conflict is largely about oil.  If that's true, then we are derelict in our duties to drive our elected leaders to do something about our gluttony when it comes to consumption of energy sources.  We are less than five percent of the earths human population but use 25% of the oil dredged up from the ground.  We import too much of that oil from places that keep the pressure pot boiling.  By contrast, Brazil is completely free of foreign sources of energy, growing it's own sugar cane crop to supply ethanol instead.  We've know since the early '70s that this was a serious problem.  I remember the long lines at the gas pumps then. And we knew that by simply changing our energy policy and fuel efficiency standards that it would equate to millions if not billions of barrels of oil per year.  And now we know the scientific facts concerning global warming and air contamination.  Forty years later, almost a half century too late, we are just beginning to wake up from our irresponsible slumber.  A nocturnal state that puts our forces, mostly Christian, in foreign territories, mostly Muslim, where we are not welcome.  To that extent, understanding the fanatical nature of our species to date, we are risking attack.  If we want to end war and keep our youth from harm, we have to change our own mentality and influence our political officials to act responsibly.  Now.  Our devotion to our patriots can't just be flag waving and patriotic song.

This was a good movie. Like a train wreck, you can't stop watching. In many respects, it's too real.  But the truth is, I don't like war movies.

I don't want to see the ""next"" generational war movie twenty years from now.",1383523200,,3201,4.545454545454546

3861013,2,B00275EGX8,"Hurt Locker is an amazing film. The feel / look of Iraq is amazing and looks right. And the message it sends about the effects war / combat has on some people's psyche is harrowing, but the film has major issues.

First up, procedure wise the guys in this film come of as cowboys, winging it with no discipline. The portrayal of the main character being a renegade or cowboy (though all three main characters have issues) working to Hollywood cliche's is terrible. Secondly, the pacing isn't bad but the shifts in tone that affect the pacing are disruptive. The tone changes abruptly and similarly the speed at which events happen, for example: There is a scene where the guys get stuck in the desert sniping insurgents, waiting in cover for sunset. This is slow and painful and for the viewer this is okay. This is the ""gritty realism"" so many speak about in the context of this film, but then it moves on to drinking and the resulitng drunken fighting session between the characters, with no lead in or transition (well they do get back to base) but it grates.

Then there is the event with a kid getting killed (or not) and the film attempts to make a statement about sentimentality and sensitivity (James) vs kindness and compassion (the CO / psychologist [this is a bit bizarre]), in both instances in the face of achieving the job. Predictably the movie now goes for the cliche'd ""futility of war"" and ""no good deed ever goes unpunished"", and then messes the later up ... sort of.

There are no concrete statements in this film, everything is just a random thing until it finally clears things up at then end finally justifying the quote from the start (""war is a drug"") and giving context to some of the statements that are unsubstantiated in the film. And again it falls flat.

There is a lot to like about this film, and in many ways it's heart is in the right place, but much like James's actions, they just don't achieve the desired goal. Gritty realism is confined to a few events and the look of the movie and some subtle moments of clarity, but by and large it is just a lick of paint that can't hide the misdirected movie made to a spec of Hollywood Gritty Realism (TM). And from there little can save it. Yes the direction is good, the camera work is mostly okay (again, to achieve gritty realism certain things are required, and they look terrible but fitting, let's just say it's to spec). Acting is ... shallow. It's not that the actors are doing a bad job, rather that the characters are so reduced to a single attribute (hardass, renegade and rookie), there is no acting being done here. They are just ... caricatures (and I'm not sure that can be praised).

Maybe off topic, but style wise there is a lot of similarity to old cowboy movies, and I'm not certain it was the right look go with. This is likely a budget issue (only 15 million ... only ... how sad is it that 15 million qualifies as only ..., but given the hardware involved that probably explains a lot of the choices that drag the film down ... like a total of three Humvee's in the entire movie).

So yeah, watching the film it does move you, but at the end you are filled with a big question: what's the point? Some guys are soldiers for the adrenalin rush. Not sure that needed a 2 hour movie with confused sub-messages.",1381104000,,3309,4.452145214521452

3861067,4,B00275EGX8,"Unfortunately, I saw Zero Dark Thirty before this movie, so I made the obvious comparison and found Hurt Locker to be a little bit lacking. It had a good story with good characters, but something about it lacked the *zing* that makes me want to watch a movie over and over again; there was no one moment that drew me in and wouldn't let go. Perhaps I've seen Jeremy Renner playing Jeremey Renner one too many times? Maybe I need to give this flick a second chance? The thing is... I don't have a strong desire to do so.

In terms of Iraq/desert war movies spanning the past 20+ years, I'd opt for The Kingdom, Jarhead, Zero Dark Thirty... and if you want to go broader, Black Hawk Down. It's a good movie, but I was hoping for a little bit more.",1373328000,,745,4.246478873239437

3861085,4,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker is likely the film that defines Kathryn Bigelow's style. The opening shot with it's low angle close-up sets the tone for the rest of the movie, she's going to show you a range of emotions mixed with the stark backdrop of war torn Iraq. I can't give this film all five stars because several times in the movie the director allows the on-screen action to overpower the dialog. Overall it's a good drama with a legitimate plot. Bigelow is a talented director and the actors do fairly good job of conveying the rush of emotions of combat in a foreign land. Everybody wants to go home except the lead character Will, played by Jeremy Renner. Renner's character seems to be addicted to the excitement. Although Will is skillful he is seen as reckless by Sgt. Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. A great deal of the movie addresses the tension between these two characters.

But please remember that artists take creative liberties to create a poignant narrative and deep characters. This isn't Black Hawk Down (fantastic 5 Star movie as well), which has a single idea hammered through your head, ""Leave no man behind."" The Hurt Locker goes deeper into the mindset, the heart and soul of its principal characters. It goes beyond idealism. It is more about motivation, reasons, and ultimate the addiction of war.

3861105,5,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the summer of 2004, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge of Bravo Company are at the volatile center of the war, part of a small counterforce specifically trained to handle the homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), that account for more than half of American hostile deaths and have killed thousands of Iraqis. A high-pressure, high-stakes assignment, the job leaves no room for mistakes, as they learn when they lose their team leader on a mission. When Staff Sergeant William James takes over the team, Sanborn and Eldridge are shocked by what seems like his reckless disregard for military protocol and basic safety measures. And yet, in the fog of war, appearances are never reliable for long. Is James really a swaggering cowboy who lives for peak experiences and the moments when the margin of error is zero - or is he a consummate professional who has honed his esoteric craft to high-wire precision? As the fiery chaos of Baghdad swirls around them, the men struggle to understand and contain their new leader long enough for them to make it home. They have only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq, but with each new mission comes another deadly encounter, and as James blurs the line between bravery and bravado, it seems only a matter of time before disaster will strike.

The cast led by Jeremy Renner (in an Oscar-caliber performance as James) & Anthony Mackie (equally impressive as Sanborn) is excellent! The directing by Kathryn Bigelow (also produced) (who also wrote and directed ""Near Dark"" (1987), directed ""Point Break"" (1991) & ""Strange Days"" (1995) is brilliant! The story & screenplay by Mark Boal (also produced) (who also wrote the story to ""The Valley Of Elah"" (2007) is brilliant!

The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did the music to ""Knowing"" (2009), & The ""Scream"" movies (1996, 1997, 2000, & in upcoming 2010) & Buck Sanders (both did the music to ""Max Payne"" (2008) is excellent! The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd (who also did the cinematography to ""United 93"" (2006) & the upcoming ""Green Zone"" (2010), both which were directed by Paul Greengrass) is excellent! The film editing by Chris Innis & Bob Murawski (who also did the film editing to most of Sam Raimi's movies, recently including, ""Drag Me To Hell"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Spider-Man 4"" (2011) is excellent! The casting by Mark Bennett (who also did the casting to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) & its sequel (2007) is excellent! The production design by Karl Jlusson (who also did the production design to ""The Weight Of Water"" (2000, which was also directed by Bigelow) & ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" (2002, also produced and directed by Bigelow) is excellent! The art direction by David Bryan is excellent! The set decoration by Amin Charif El Masri is excellent! The costume design by George L. Little (who also did the costume design to the upcoming ""The Crazies"" (2010) is excellent!

This is an impressive action-thriller / war film that is better than most done recently. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best film of the year. This will possibly be remembered during Oscar season.",1369526400,,3195,4.858715596330275

I can't say for sure how close to real life it is but it sure seemed to have feeling and heart in what I had seen and makes you really feel for the charactors in the story. A walk through the days of a team of bomb deacrivators stationed in Iraq during the war. I was never there and I thank my lucky stars for the men and women who have and are serving for the US and I hope they all come home safe soon but if this is even a little like it is over there my heart truly goes out to each and everyone of them.,1369008000,,800,3.603448275862069

3861111,5,B00275EGX8,"The war zone never looked so realistic or as dangerous as it does here in Kathryn Bigelow's best film yet, The Hurt Locker. From all early reports it appears the film is likely to walk off with the top Oscar honor. And finally the first film in probably the past 6 years that truly deserves to get a best picture nod. The hurt locker is full of suspense and danger. It seriously does keep you on the edge of your seat. In fact you might find it hard to resist biting your nails sometimes. The film takes a much different direction than many of the other war films we have seen. There are no massive gun battles here, not all that much blood and body parts but lots of intense unsettling tension combined with razor sharp direction, hard edge editing and cinematography, and some great acting. This is one great film and I highly recommend it.",1367884800,,842,4.403846153846154

3861132,5,B00275EGX8,"The DVD movie for last night really got to me. It was ""The Hurt Locker"" and it didn't really have any stars. Don't take that as a negative, as everyone who was in the movie was a star. Very strange movie. It was more like a ""you-are-there"" documentary of a small part of the war in Iraq and it seemed ultra-realistic. Amazing! I can understand the Academy Awards. It's a wonder it didn't get more! The movie followed a small force in a Humvee whose task was to disarm bombs. Tense? Oh, yeah! In any  case, they were followed on their day to day tasks as they went through their time until they were relieved by a new crew. The movie took place in a little over a month and it was date stamped as you proceeded. It really wasn't much of a story, but at the same time, it was one of the most powerful stories you might ever see. You get out of it what you read into it. In a lot of ways, that's the best kind of story.

Okay, let me give a little of my own personal background. I've never been in the military and I've never even been close to combat of any kind. So, how am I to judge a combat film? Well, I'm not judging it. What I'm saying is that this can be a very powerful movie, if you allow it to be. When I got through with the movie, I went to the Amazon Reviews just to see what other people thought of it. I was glad I read the reviews and comments after viewing the movie. Not everyone likes the movie, to say the least. Some think it's awful. Many give it high praise. Well, the reviews, together with their comments, are all over the place, and a lot of them are very thoughtful and well worth reading. This movie has impact! Trust me on that. See for yourself. Whether you like the movie or don't like the movie, it certainly gets things stirred up, more than any movie I've seen in decades. I'm giving it five stars on that basis.

I'll just say that it is amazing to me that this movie was sooooo hyped... it tells me that at the time, the public was hungry for footage around the Iraq war, making this very much a period piece. What amazes me is how formulaic the film is: a John-Wayne central character who doesn't play by the rules and cannot seem to suppress that thrill of combat even when his family is in consideration. Yuck!!! Obviously, those of us who are actually military Vets are shaking our heads at the misrepresentation... Hollywood, you might want to learn that good writing about REAL situations is better than being lazy and following some formula. Even mediocre representatinon of the truth -- in my humble opinion -- is better than these types of wash-rinse-repeat plots: One of my favorites is ""We Were Soldiers"", a sleeper hit that was an excellent book and a fairly well produced movie which represented ALL sides of men at war, and the movie did not fall to these types of ridiculous lonely-soldier-John-Wayne-crossed-with-adrenaline-need that seems to be a recurring need for audiences who weren't there. If you are okay with that type of entertainment, consider this a five star movie. And while I have no problem if that is what you want (I like those types of movies, just not where I have experience), for my review, I have to give this three stars.",1360368000,,1426,4.708

I heard an interview with the lead actor on NPR as this film was coming out. He was talking about the stress of filming it, how he would go to his hotel each night and shake, how when he got home, people didn't understand and I wanted to laugh. What an idiot. If he thinks that is tough, he should go and do it for real and see how he feels.

The fact that this film won an Oscar speaks voulmes to how Hollywood sees war. A hollywood lens.

This movie disrespects not only EOD, but veterans everywhere. It is a complete joke and isn't even a good film in its own right.

The unusual thing about Hurt Locker is that it's made more in the style of a European film than an American movie. There is no portentous narrator doing cheesy voice-overs. Things are not painfully obvious. The director does not hang a neon sign over the important bits. You have to pay attention.

And it has a great ending.

I grew up in a military family. My step-father did 3 tours in Vietnam, and volunteered for a 6-month extension after the second tour. I know all too well that there is a certain military type who simply *cannot* stay away.

She doesn't shy from a theme - that war can be like a drug, both in its intensity and exhilaration and in the devastation of its effects.  At the same time she doesn't preach.  She tells a compelling story of a group of men who are tasked with one of the most critical and dangerous missions in Iraq, whose story has rarely been told and never this effectively: the bomb disposal units, whose job it is to find and defuse dangerous explosives under highly chaotic circumstances.

While scenes of action are shot with a dynamic, documentary-style camera, the technique is not overused in this film.  Bigelow knows when to slow down and focus, and achieves a balance between storytelling and action, with a special focus on the kinds of relationships men build in times of war.  Bigelow is not afraid to let central characters die unexpectedly, and the film leads in some very unpredictable directions, that are for the most part plausible (with a few loose ends).  The film looks very good, and conveys the atmosphere, the heat, the tension, the explosive moments, all very effectively.  Recommended.",1358985600,,1440,5.956310679611651
3861201,4,B00275EGX8,"This movie fascinated me. I come from an Army background and was married to a Marine so I'm familiar with the adrenaline addiction that life in a war zone produces in some people. At home the main character is just one more bored, restless young man with few future prospects. As an Army bomb disposal expert in Iraq he can play cowboy every day, challenging the odds in deadly circumstances and riding the rush each time he walks away unharmed. High-ranking officers praise him publicly and other soldiers either fear him or are in awe of him. The greater the thrills, the greater the craving for them.

I have no idea whether the conditions in Iraq are portrayed accurately here, so if you're looking for documentary realism don't watch this movie. If you want a study of, as the quote in the opening says, ""war as a drug,"" this movie is superb. Plus, Jeremy Renner nails the leading role cold.",1358899200,,896,4.6

In the final analysis, this movie is primarily about a guy who's gone so far over the edge as a bomb tech that he's unable to reintegrate into his life at home with his wife and kid. Everyone else in the movie is as a second thought, unmemorable, and mere cannon fodder. How about a better movie where you develop a real emotional connection with the supporting actors, and an ending where the main character gets the help he needs to reintegrate with his home life, free from his addiction to adrenaline?

3861284,4,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker is a decent movie. As i stated in the title of my review, The Hurt Locker would most likely be enjoyed more by people without military experience because as the saying goes ignorance is bliss and if someone doesn't know better then they likely won't spot the inaccuracies.

Frankly i go back and forth mentally on this film on how exactly they wanted to portray the U.S. Armed Forces and what they were trying to say about the military. I say this because of the personalities they portray of the soldiers.

The plot is simple they are finishing the remainder of a tour and dealing with the day to day life of war. Along with dealing with Jeremy's character being a cowboy.

The movie isn't bad not in the traditional sense if you detach yourself from logic and enjoy the trills and firefights and don't care about inaccuracies then odds are you will enjoy this film. However if your someone who just cannot overlook things and are able to spot the inaccuracies then you'll be annoyed with them every time you watch The Hurt Locker.

3861288,4,B00275EGX8,"A lot of the reviews of this movie focus on whether it's true to life. I frankly comment, although some of their comments seem pretty picky and trivial (e.g., that the soldiers in this movie don't say ""hooha"" enough). I'll leave the accuracy questions to the experts. Here, I'll focus on a few issues I had with The Hurt Locker as a MOVIE - which is what it is after all (I mean, does anybody think Apocalypse Now was historically accurate?).

THE GOOD

The movie really does build tension in a few key moments. Ironically, by not building any of the characters into the ""star"" or ""point of view"" character, there's a lot more suspense. We don't know if the guy attempting to defuse the bombs will succeed. The movie leverages this to great effect in some places.

Just as important, the movie doesn't undermine the tension with a suffocating soundtrack. There actually isn't much of a soundtrack, so the silence really allows the tension to build. The lack of a suffocating soundtrack also reinforces every gust of wind and every click of the ammo cartridge.

Along these lines, the movie does a great job emphasizing smaller moments. It certainly isn't just one gunfight after another, constant gunfire. Rather, there are moments when the most important thing is to clean the ammunition before it can be used. Each IED is treated as a very real and serious threat worthy of the film's attention.

THE BAD

Except for the character several reviewers have called the maverick EOD, none of the characters stand out. All of the soldiers come across as relatively uninteresting, almost cookie-cutter stereotypes of a ""grunt"". The EOD perhaps goes to the other extreme of the maverick soldier who takes too many risks, but at least his character was more compelling to follow. He showed a genuine range of emotion and had a far more interesting relationship with the other troops. He has a multidimensional personality full of quirks. I found myself caring about him, but ignoring the rest of the troops.

I'm not a fan of the pseudo-documentary style of filming. It looks like it was filmed in 48 frames per second. But the movie isn't a documentary and the style just distracts at some points.

Overall, 3.5 stars. It's probably the only noteworthy movie about the Iraq War thus far and worth watching for that alone.",1352419200,,2315,4.784461152882206

I thought it would be a great movie because it dealt with the Iraq War and I was indeed very eager to watch it. I admit I was entertained because it has some very gripping and high tension moments. All the bomb diffusion scenes and the sniper scene at the mid point were very detailed and well executed. That being said however I can't help but agree with many of the user comments pointing out the inaccuracies.

-The opening scene has a man detonating the bomb with a cell phone and the team simply yells at him to put it down, had it been in real life the man would have been shot instantly.

-The character Sargent First Class William James is portrayed as a rugged, careless lone wolf who ignores his teammates and at one point leaves his base to track down who he suspects killed a small boy he befriended. Had someone done these things in real life he would have been highly disciplined and more than likely discharged.

-And the last thing I have a problem with the movie clichs soldiers as war junkies who love combat and are unable to adjust to civilian life once they return home. While some military personnel may indeed go through this, most people would be glad to be out of the war and be back home with their loved ones.

So to sum it all up the acting was indeed very good, all the actors gave great performances and it does have high tension scenes.

I should also point out many people tend to exaggerate their combat expertise and experience and just because you wore a uniform doesn't make you an expert on all things military. As I read these reviews I can't help but laugh. Sure, some movies tend to go way over the top in regards to what's realistic or even plausible but there is one caveat that all of the people who are lambasting the movie based on realism are failing to grasp. Realism doesn't sell; if I were to make a movie about the average day for an average soldier no one would watch it.

Have you ever met anyone who ever acted one hundred percent natural and themselves when they know they are being filmed? I watched this movie and I think it was a very good, entertaining movie and that's what movies are supposed to do, ENTERTAIN. The difference between myself and some of the negative reviewers is that I'm not naive enough to watch a movie and think it is fact or that writers/directors don't take MASSIVE liberties with situations or their realistic nature; even ""based on a true story"" movies do this because if they were 100% fact and no fiction no one would watch because again, they would be very boring. I am smart enough to separate reality from Hollywood movie making and I don't need personal experiences to do this.

3861333,5,B00275EGX8,"Except for the first few minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" no film I've ever seen comes closer than ""The Hurt Locker"" to portraying the randomness, senselessness, brutality and the excitement of battle. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes who makes a brief appearance early in the movie, there are no stars and few recognizable actors in this story about a small group of men whose mission is to defuse improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq. Frequently under surveillance, though not always certain whether it is by curious bystanders or enemies in civilian clothing, these men are at risk every moment they are in the field.

The principal character, Sgt. First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is one of those who seem to get an adrenaline rush in the face of danger. His colleagues, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackle) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geaghty), see no glamor in their task. Sanborn is a workman-like soldier, trying to do his duty in as safe a manner as possible. Eldridge is in a near-constant state of panic, eager to be somewhere else, any place else. They are not presented as stereotypes, however, nor is anyone else in this absorbing movie. Everyone in the field knows he may die at any moment, and how they manage to hold up in the searing heat of Iraq in a war they aren't asked to understand may be the main point of this film, if indeed it has any point other than War is Hell and the Iraqi War is a particularly terrible slice of Hell.

3861336,1,B00275EGX8,"Having persuaded myself that America under President Obama is becoming more sophisticated in its approach to the Middle East -- opening its eyes to the complications of Afghanistan and Iraq, questioning its blanket support for Israel, renouncing the legacy of the neocons -- watching the film `The Hurt Locker' was an unexpected reality check of how slowly some things change.

Within minutes, I was believing nothing that I was seeing. By half way, I was wondering why some intelligent friends could like a movie that seemed so absurd to me, and why there was such unanimity among top film critics to love it. By the time the credits started rolling, I was furiously puzzling about why Hollywood granted six Oscars to what seemed to be a screenplay more suited for retooling as a clever parody of B movie war films. `The Hurt Locker' clashes with almost all aspects of my experiences of Iraq, war zones and American soldiers, and, I believe, has an insidiously militarist subtext.

Take the opening sequence: it is unthinkable that an Iraqi would casually come up to an American unit engaged in high-tension bomb disposal to exchange peculiar pleasantries about California. A middle-aged man appears at a butcher's shop fiddling clumsily with a cellphone. If he's deliberately triggering the bomb, why does he come outside where he will be seen and is in direct range of the blast? Or if he is an idiotic butcher trying to make a call, which coincidentally triggers the bomb, then any cellphone could set off an explosion. Every house in that street would have had people busily phoning each other. It gets worse: Sgt. James drags up seven booby-trapped 155mm shells with one hand (wish I could do that - that's about 300kg, the weight of three big men), a mad bomb disposal, insurgents who can hit moving targets with Kalashnikov rifles at absurd distances, and a truly bizarre solo mission into the back streets of Baghdad. I've gone on long enough: real veterans of the Iraq War have already taken issue with such details many times.

Of course the film is fiction. But it does everything to make us believe it is representing reality. The script, the film's hype often boasts, resulted from work by an embedded freelancer who wanted to show the soldiers' war. The shaky camerawork is supposed to make us feel that we are watching an edgy documentary. The extras are real Iraqi refugees, being filmed in Jordan, sometimes as close as possible to the Iraqi border.

That's because in documentary journalism, having the audience believe in the reality of a story is critical to triggering a strong emotional response. It's the same whether telling stories round a camp fire or writing for the New York Times. And this is where the `The Hurt Locker' does a real disservice to Americans. Although the film is shot with no overt politics or discussion among the soldiers about why they are in Iraq, there is a clear agenda behind all those brilliantly filmed slo-mo pressure waves, sinister improvised explosive devices and the jaunty, hips-thrust-forward gait of Sgt. James as he cockily lopes into action in his bomb suit.

Take the film's portrayal of Iraqis, for instance. I can accept that ordinary American soldiers don't have the access to ordinary people that I was lucky to have as an Arabic-speaking civilian, and I too witnessed some of the soldiers' frustrated interactions with the `hajjis'. But nothing justifies the film's total negativity towards the inhabitants of the country, and it does not match my experience of the overall U.S. military work with Iraqis. One by one, `The Hurt Locker' portrays Iraqis as cowardly, poor, inadequate, base, stupid, treacherous, dangerous, wild, wily, living in filthy cities or most commonly just blank-faced and threatening. The only half-positive character is a cheeky DVD-selling boy on the base who is befriended by Sgt. James (note to casting director: when developing world kids pick up perfect jive-talk, they pick up perfectly fluent accents too). But other Iraqis, those inhuman nihilists, murder the boy or someone like him and then booby-trap his body.

Having thoroughly transferred this most primitive view of Iraqis to the audience, the film also trashes the idea that they understand anything other than the language of force. The vehicle for this is the unit psychiatrist, portrayed as an other-worldly ivy-league man who means oh-so-well but is utterly out of his depth. This `doc' rides along with the disposal squad on a mission and is somehow left in the wasteland outside, mocked by the locals and the scriptwriter as he says absurdly `I love it here. This is a beautiful place.' (Another military disconnect: never would four lone soldiers take on a vast, newly discovered insurgent base and bomb-making factory.) His nave and wimpish approach no doubt represents the ideas of silly liberals like me who believe that engagement is better than the use of force. It earns him the right, immediately granted by the director, to be blown away by the very people he's been foolish enough to try to be friendly to.

For any who think I've been touched by too much of the real Middle Eastern sun, read on. The scene with the suicide bomber clinches it. Here, the forces of jihadi darkness have encased an man in a bomb jacket and he's begging to be defused, since, as he says, he's a decent family man with children and just wants to go home. The good American, Sgt. James, decides to risk his own life to free him from his fate. For those uninitiated in the doctrines of American Middle East militarists, this is the gloss: at great cost to ourselves, we are ready to liberate you from Saddam Hussein, we are idealistically struggling to bring you democracy, we want to free you from the cage of your tyrannical and/or Islamofascist regimes. But here's the problem: this Iraqi is locked into his bomb, and even Sgt. James's miracles can't release him. So on to the next step of the doctrine: ultimately, it's all the Middle East's fault. America has done its best to help, but the region is incurable. The bomb obliterates the Iraqi.

To ram home the point that violence is the only way to deal with the Middle Eastern labyrinth, the film then sacrifices the only credible main character, the African-American Sgt. Sanborn. Having rightly resisted and criticized Sgt. James's antics for most of the film, Sgt. James's act of lunatic bravery with the suicide bomber inexplicably flips Sgt. Sanborn from being the common-sense foil into the accomplice. The subtext here is the shared ground between war-hungry Republican neocons and Democrat hawks -- the conceit that they are liberals ""mugged by reality"". It's the Bernard Lewis doctrine again: `hit those Muslims hard and they'll soon obey'. This message also lies behind by the early scene where Sgt. James's willpower and readiness to fire his pistol is all that forces a supposedly stubborn Iraqi to back down from a confrontation.

It's possible that the film-makers have no agenda and were just mugged by common American prejudices about the Middle East's troubles. But I find an innocent explanation of `The Hurt Locker' hard to accept, since the reality that is doing the mugging here is so artificial. I have rarely seen a more undignified and unbelievable character progression as when the sensible Sgt. Sanborn suddenly salutes Sgt. James's lethally mad ""courage"". To add insult to injury, the director forces the face of the previously focused, four-square Sgt. Sanborn into an expression of dog-like devotion.

This is of course a film told from the point of view of the ordinary soldier, to whom the situation in Iraq did seem pretty baffling. There are moments where the film does ring a faint bell, when we see the hesitant team specialist's terrors, or Sgt. James's sudden kindnesses to his companions under extreme pressure. But that doesn't go anywhere near justifying all the other distortions. And the film fails utterly as a story: the crazy and mostly repetitive events of the film work no change in the hero, his family's needs do not melt him and he just goes back to the war. So the film ends more or less where it started, with Sgt. James doing his trademark I'm-the-king-of-the-hill walk, somewhere between keep on truckin' and nuke-them-all.

That's because the film's principal theme is that ""war is a drug"", as journalist Chris Hedges put it in a compelling and self-critical book on his addiction to war reporting. Almost as if the director suspects that viewers won't get the point, the quote is spelled out not once but twice right after the opening credits. Friends whose views I respect say that this exciting representation of a war junkie is what keeps them thrilled to the end. They dismiss as unimportant the idea that the Middle Eastern context is distractingly misrepresented, and wave away my argument that a similar dice-with-death film could never have won such praise if it was filmed against an unrealistic American backdrop. But even on these narrow terms, I question the artistic value of a continuum of unchanging illustrations of Sgt. James's recklessness. There's no subtlety about it. The director seems to feel this weakness towards the end. When the film's quiet, nervous third main person is injured due to Sgt. James's folly, the film suddenly has him scream super-sophisticated blame of the danger-seeker's motives: ""Looking for trouble to get your ****ing adrenaline fix, you ****?!"" That's character development?

If this film is really going to be studied in 20 years time as ""a classic of tension, fear and bravery"", as the New Yorker suggests, I hope the emphasis will be on finding out why film-directors, movie-goers and war-makers all seem to fall for such nonsense so easily.",1335312000,5,9760,4.955406230910201
3861337,5,B00275EGX8,"For those who haven't been down range I can't suggest this movie enough. I was an Army HUMINT specialist in Baghdad and this movie can gets to me like nothing else. The dull sandy surroundings, creeping terror at every step and the urge of panic with every action this move goes beyond any other when it comes to a dose of unflinching reality.

The mundane approach captivates when you first see it. I remember how routine it seemed to be deployed then a few mortars and IEDs made the experience far more humbling. Walking around a market changed. Saying hello changed. Taking a step without worrying changed. The movie gives you that horror and intimacy at the same time. I still have nightmares about Iraq and this film in an odd way soothes that. I remember working with EOD and the sheer terror operating around them. Cellphones didn't escape your gaze, wrong looks didn't go unchecked. All perfectly captured on film.

If you can't sleep after watching this movie the first time then it did its job. I still can't go a month without hearing mortars and seeing dead bodies.

The lingo is sound (ish, there are some flaws) still hearing a redneck yell ""imshi"" brings me back. I can't tell you the fear of operating a 50 cal the first time. You're parylized and just hoping militia doesn't sense it. One thing though, don't smoke when you've left the wire unless you want to get shot. Oh, and eyepro is a must but aside from that I abandoned my disbelief to the point of panic. Hell, I even wore a shemagh just like the movies. Didn't know it looked cool, it just kept dust out of my mouth.

Granted, Iraq will be a distant memory soon enough bu this is a movie I'll watch and watch over again to at least think that the sacrifices made weren't in vain.",1335225600,3,1755,4.475

I watched this yesterday (finally) and wasn't expecting a 5 star masterpiece but was expecting about a 4 star riveting war movie. Needless to say I didn't get what I was expecting. The movie was *good* at all levels but nothing Oscar or major award worthy. To me the film looks like it was shot digitally which is fine if it would have added some ""grittiness"" to it or something. To me it just looked cheap. Honestly I never once really cared about any of the soldiers and that suprised me to. There was simply nothing for me here.

As much as I thought Avatar was overrated as an Oscar contender for best picture, if I would have had a vote, I probably would have chosen it over this (and I can't believe I'm saying that). And while I thought the directing was realistic and solid, I defenitaly would have voted for Cameron as Best Director. The near to final season scene (w/ the suiside bomber) was ultra compelling and the sole reason I give it an extra 1/4 star. Overall....thumbs down",1335052800,,1004,4.451086956521739

Of course, the plot has the usual Hollywood touches of the character being seen as a ""cowboy"" type, and it's hard to believe that in the real world of the military that behavior would be tolerated, but it works in the film.  I did get a sense of what it's like for the EOD to defuse a bomb and the unpredictable, and inhuman insurgents who will stop at nothing including murdering innocent men and children.

3861343,2,B00275EGX8,"Set in modern Baghdad, The Hurt Locker follows the lives of three of the US Army's bomb disposal technicians as they battle insurgent bombers and their own nerves to stay alive in the world's most dangerous war zone.

The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Steel/dp/B000H8RW88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Steel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-Break/dp/B0050BHM1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point Break</a>) and, released in 2008 to much fanfare and critical acclaim, it was nominated for nine Oscars and eventually won six. It's hard, now, to see what the fuss was about. It is a fairly conventional war movie, typical Hollywood fare in fact and I can see nothing about it that lifts above the herd and it is certainly not the equal of, for instance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B003LVZYL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Das-Boot/dp/B00004CXLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Das Boot</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Platoon/dp/B00004W4I5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Platoon</a>.

Yes, it's well shot and composed, effectively conveying the dusty, sweaty, grimy life of a soldier in Iraq. Indeed, there are some award winning individual shots (the slo-mo explosion sequence where the dust jumps off the roof of a car is particularly tasty) but the ensemble is barely above the ordinary -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Kings/dp/B00004W4FX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Kings</a>&nbsp;did it just as well.

It's well acted. Jeremy Renner does a fine job as the maverick bomb disposal tech (you may be able to guess where I'm going to go with this), Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty convince as his strung-out support crew and there are some surprising (and brief) cameos from Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Guy Pearce. But, again, the acting is merely convincing: steely eyes, square jaws, head-in-hands-despair... all that sort of thing.

The story, I'm afraid, is what lets the film down. The word ""maverick"" really should be banned from use in Hollywood these days (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Cruise-and-Tony-Scott/dp/B00004TT89/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Cruise and Tony Scott</a>&nbsp;have so much to answer for). It really does a profound disservice to the exeptional bravery and professionalism of bomb disposal technicians of all nationalities to see the lead character yank a cluster of IED's from the ground by their detonating cords, opening the boot of an explosive-laden car by means of a hefty kick or letting off a smoke grenade as he approaches the danger zone ""to create a diversion"". There are plenty of other military mess-ups; some of these are clearly excusable cinematographic necessities (soldiers standing around in groups, M113 armoured personnel carriers instead of Bradleys and so-on). However, plenty of others are inexcusably sloppy and betray the absence of a decent (or any) military advisor. I was particularly offended when the three main characters rushed off alone and on foot into the hostile night-time suburbs to track down a bomber... and then split up because ""we can cover more ground that way"" for heavens' sake! If the US Army really operate like this (and I cannot convince my self that they do) there is hardly any surprise that the war has lasted so long and achieved so little as it has.

In the end, this is a deeply ordinary film and it is prone to many of the usual war movie cliches; tensions between the maverick and his by-the-book colleague ultimately resolved, friendship with with the local street urchin, the race against time, shall I cut the red wire or the blue wire? oh the horror! oh the humanity! think of the children!

Without the hype it would have made a fairly decent war movie and I would happily have given it three stars. Because of the hype, my sensibilities are offended and I can only give it two.

There's plenty of good movies out there, but few of those films raise its banner to future generations as an exemplary archetype of the filmmaking art. Technical precision isn't always involved in that decision, but cultural significance is, and I believe Hurt Locker stands as one of them.

Director Bigelow depicts James, a reckless bomb specialist who chooses to be in danger by his own accord, often defusing explosives under gunfire. He's obsessed with his work. He wants to feel what the bomb maker feels, which is almost ironic considering that the designer may be standing idly by waiting to detonate it. For him, war is a drug.

What we have in Locker is an experience as old as civilization itself. This time it's given a twenty-first century facelift with a terrorist enemy that prefers pointless chaos over established order. Still, an entire generation of 9-11 adults signed up for it. That's the focus, I believe, of the film, the generation, not your view on President Bush's war. Locker dissects millennials with focused intensity. To future generations it declares: Say what you will about our war, but this is who we, or at least a volunteer pocket of us, were.

The Hurt Locker winning awards for best director and picture over Avatar, especially when the winning movie came out in 2008(HELLO!)! It kinda has me thinking that someone who became a fanatic of this movie completely bribed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for The Hurt Locker to gain an extra chance at Academy Awards when that person became a sore loser that Slumdog Millionaire(won best director and picture 2008) took everything from this movie.

As for the movie, I do give director Kathryn Bigelow points for trying to go for realistic in this war. This kinda stuff I can assume did happen in the Iraqi war, but the movie itself is just far from great and not even close to good. The protaganist that is played by Jeremy Renner doesn't do too bad as the risk-taking bomb disarmer who treats bombs as video games, but he should've been given more than what was given to him to do.

Anchored by Jeremy Renner's impeccable performance, The Hurt Locker is a revelation for longtime director Kathryn Bigelow, and absolutely overshadows other recent cinematic attempts (many of which being very respectable in their own right) at portraying the middle east debacle.

The Hurt Locker transcends formula and, occasionally, even the own limitations of its subject matter, reigning as something unique, mercilessly vicious, and consistently exhilarating.  The first half, in particular, will have the entire audience biting down to the quick.

Not a single action or scene seems out of place or impractical; it's a gritty diamond of a war epic that sheds potent drama only when necessary, never feeling artificial or obligatory, and smolders with a masterclass of suspense seldom seen in film making.

3861352,1,B00275EGX8,"The one thing I really have an annoyance over with this film, which caused me to audibly groan as it happened - was the depiction of British SAS or Spec Forces as incompetent, irresponsible and reckless cowboys. Let me set the scene, which rang so untrue as to ruin the entire movie for me.

The 3 member bomb team just stumble across a stranded SAS team in the desert, the SAS team have two prisoners and have a flat tire. Apparently, the SAS team are stranded because they need to change a tire and have ""used up their wrench.""

1 - A British person would never use the word wrench for tire iron.

The British SAS fella then says they used it up because the bloke changing the tire ""threw it at somebody!"" GIVE ME A BREAK! Does anybody believe for a minute that a professional crew of SAS with 2 important prisoners, would recklessly throw a tire iron at another member of the crew and thus make their situation worse by losing it that way? NO, NO, NO, NO!

This depiction of the SAS/Mercs at this early stage is not only beyond moronic, it is patronizing and utterly unbelievable. Whoever the technical advisers were on this movie require being left in a room with a member of the REAL SAS for a few hours. Guess what happens next?

So next, there appears a sniper on the scene and the two groups come under fire. The leader of the SAS team calls for the Barret sniper rifle, but his handling of it and his placement deliberately serve to show his total incompetence and lack of field craft with this weapon. Not only does he fail to have a spotter but he also places himself clearly in view of the enemy sniper ... and guess what folks ... as you would expect from someone doing this, he is shot and killed!

But then ... guess who slides in to save the day? The 3 man Marine crew .... and they take up the same stupid position the SAS guy took up, but this time the enemy sniper decided he won't fire on the Marines until they have spotted him and can kill him. So what this scene is telling the audience is that stock standard Marines are smarter than British Spec Forces and better soldiers. HILARIOUS!

What the scene tells me is that the director and producer of this film are complete IDIOTS! No SAS crew would do what this film depicts and these film makers clearly have no idea who the SAS are and what they are about. This film is moronic at best.

First, what is bad about this movie?  This movie scores poorly in the following categories: story line; acting; cinematography; music; sound effect; screenplay; tension.  Consider the poster scene.  You are trying to defuse a bomb that you apparently are not familiar with.  You find a wire that leads from the bomb to somewhere else.  As a smart person, your next action?  The brilliant director decides yanking the wire and pulling several other bombs is a strategy that will resonant with a viewer's brain.  Come on.

Then, what is good about this movie?  Price, I guess.  The price is good not for you, but for Nicolas Chartier, the French producer of this sorry piece of junk.  Mr. Chartier got Hollywood on his side.  Unlike other stupid movies, which are deservedly unknown, this abysmally stupid movie is hailed by Hollywood moguls as smart. You ask why.

What it does very well is it focuses on one man's position during the war efforts.  He diffuses bombs.  This film was shot in a way that gives you a documentary feel as if its really happening.  This makes it all the more unsettling.  We follow the role of a bomb tech guy who straps on an 80lb suit in 100 degree weather in the desert.  He then goes to a location where a bomb has been discovered and he dangerously pulls the wires from it so it doesn't go off.  We watch with fearful anticipated anxiety as he carefully pulls each one out.  Onlookers by those that live in the area look on as these soldiers move into their territory in hummers with guns.  You don't know if the onlookers are good or bad and it's brilliantly captured.  This is a realistic portrait of the feeling of what it would be like if you were a soldier rolling in there or if you were living there and these guys were coming in.  Jeremy Renner plays the bomb tech guy and developed a three dimensional character with neurosis and faults.  His performance is incredible and it makes the movie all the more interesting.

3861357,3,B00275EGX8,"""Hurt Locker"" is a modern version of a movie that's been made dozens of times before for the plethora of conflicts in which the Federal Government has engaged.  The performances are great, and there is a lot of tension when it comes to defusing the bombs.  In a way, this is the old British WWII series ""Danger UXB"" (which is worth seeking out) tarted up with a big budget for the Second Iraq War.

However, I didn't find this movie to be anything special.  When you get a title card that tells you how many days Bravo company has left on its tour, you know for a fact exactly what is going to happen to which member of the team, if you've ever seen a movie.  When somebody gets short, and they're in a cop or military movie, there's only one thing that can happen.  Sadly, that same cliche happens here.  The pace of the movie is overly slow.  I know they're trying to establish tension, but after 30 minutes there's no real story or plot and the audience is left wondering what exactly is going on.  We don't really get what the bomb guys are doing to defuse the bombs; they don't talk us through it or give any explanation, so you're also left wondering about the tension and when it's supposed to stop.  Hey, there's also the cliche ""wildman"" who breaks all the rules to do the job.

The bomb disposal niche coupled with the personal feel created by the indie origin of this movie help separate it from the many 'hero story'...'political statement generated tragedy'...and 'go America' war flicks in existence.

The ending of this movie seems like it has a behind the scenes story involving studio executives, timing, and the makers selling options proposed to studios/distributors.  The ending could have been so much more and it actually does not fit in with some of the body of the picture.  To try and put a rah rah...support our troops ending on a movie that spent over an hour creating a totally different feel was awkward.  Even the music in the last minute did not fit.  The last time I watched this movie I stopped it before the last few scenes/45-60 seconds and it was much improved.

This is a good movie, but not `Best Picture good'.  It won Best Picture because of luck.  It was released in the worst year for movies in my lifetime.

3861359,5,B00275EGX8,"This is an action packed film that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The characters are propelled from one risky situation to the next without much of a break between. The film is about a bomb removal or disposal unit who must deal with the vast proliferation of IEDs set by the insurgents for our young soldiers. The fact that these IEDs are produced using diverted military supplies is beyond tragic incompetence.

Jeremy Renner is superb as Sergeant James, a fascinating character who seems driven for many reasons to take outrageous risks when dismantling IEDs. He is contrasted with Sergeant Sanborn, the voice of reason and experience, which is highly annoyed by excessive risk taking. Most viewers would identify with Sergeant Sanborn's common sense in the face of ever changing risks. A third fellow, Specialist Eldridge, is also a character with whom many may identify, for he knows that war in Iraq had become insane and he struggles to mentally hold himself together under the stress.

I found this film to be highly entertaining with a compelling story and realistic characters in challenging situations. I loved Black Hawk Down and found this film to be as good a film. A year in the life of a bomb disposal unit would be a terrible year for each day presented new life threatening situations, often ambiguous signals, and ever changing risks. When I read the other reviews, particularly those folks who gave the film low marks, I found that most of the complaints were highly technical and detail oriented. In other words, for the film to get it right, every detail about military operations must be exactly portrayed. I am not sure I agree with this since the essence of the film, the messages conveyed, seemed authentic and fair. The American soldiers were portrayed with a sense of fair play and balance. I actually found some of the negative reviews to be educational, particularly those reviewers who have served in Iraq and who had detailed criticism of various aspects of the film. But these same reviewers rarely concerned themselves with the underlying character development and sequence of events that came together in this portrayal of one slice of the war in Iraq.

The film does an excellent job of conveying the almost impossible task our soldiers faced in a country undergoing a civil war and filled with insurgency. In civil war horrors are inflicted on citizens by citizens, as gruesomely conveyed in scenes in this film. When dealing with insurgency, it is impossible to tell if the man smiling at you is about to kill you, again as this film perfectly portrayed. The film also stays away from politics and political statements and it does this by focusing on the Iraqi people and settings and the American soldiers and their predicaments. In actuality, this made more of a moral and ethical statement than any political statement could make.",1315267200,3,2899,4.888211382113822
3861360,3,B00275EGX8,"I try to watch movies that win Oscars, especially Best Picture.  That said, I had trepidations over watching The Hurt Locker.  Finally I watched it hoping that it would set aside my concerns over whether or not this movie was worthy of the Best Picture award.

The film is set in Iraq and follows a team of demolition experts.  Most people, myself included, have little appreciation for placing themselves at risk to diffuse the myriad of homemade bombs that are used against American troops in our two current overseas wars.  But these men are willing to risk life and limb to do their duty.

This will not be an ethical or moral debate on the wars.  They are what they are.  But I still am puzzled over how this film won Best Picture.  The movies dragged on from scene to scene without really developing its characters.  But then look at the real war in Iraq.  It drags on from year to year and there seems to be no real sense of purpose now that Saddam Hussein has been deposed and dead for more than eight years.  The film ecoes this sense of forlornness that many feel when thinking about the war.

This is a good movie that has decent actors performing a decent script.  It has drama, tension, some humor, and a lot of relief once the bombs are disabled.  Ther eal war is winding down, but at what cost?  Aside from the dead on both sides there is the need to rebuild in an era when rebuilding may just lead to the next petty dictator rising to power and muscling his way onto the world scene.  Best Picture?  There must not have been much competition.",1313712000,3,1558,4.388111888111888

I could not have predicted the level of suspense the film is able to generate with the excellent directing, cinematography and sound editing.

As others have said the movie ends in seemingly unusual or perhaps unexciting way, but even though it feels like the ending drops the ball, the entire experience is worth it.

3861375,2,B00275EGX8,"It's been awhile since I last saw this movie so I'll remember the best that I can during this review. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I won't say that THE HURT LOCKER is a terrible film, but Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay of 2009? Give me a break. If this was directed by a man instead of a woman, it wouldn't have been NEARLY as successful as it was. The one thing people keep praising about this movie is how realistic it is. I must be missing something here because I did not for one second believe anything that was happening onscreen. A lot of it has to do with that God-forsaken shaky cam technique that tries to make the movie seem like a documentary but just gives me a headache. Here's a crazy idea: if you're going to shoot it like a documentary, why not MAKE A DOCUMENTARY?! I'm sure it'd be better than this! The other thing that really bothers me is that I never felt like the filmmakers actually understood anything about what it's like serving as a US soldier in Iraq, aside from the battles. Everyone acts and talks in a contrived, Hollywoodesque manner. One line in particular makes me cringe. It's the scene where Jeremy Renner's character (Sgt. James) is about to defuse a bomb, but he starts to take off his protective gear that shields him from the explosion. One of his colleagues asks him, ""What are you doing?"" Sgt. James replies: ""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die comfortably."" Did I accidentally put Die Hard into the DVD player? Oh no, it's a movie about DEFUSING BOMBS IN IRAQ! Or how about the scene where James talks about things that almost killed him? ""That's my wedding ring. Like I said, things that almost killed me."" Bleh. Little moments like that really add up in the long run.

Despite all of that, I think THE HURT LOCKER does have a fascinating premise: War is a drug. That's something I haven't seen in a movie, a war movie no less, but there's not a lot of interest to really explore this idea. Sgt. James just acts like a wannabe 80s action star most of the time, and the plot is all over the place. It's just this happens and this happens and this happens for 2 hours. I wouldn't mind except that these sequences of events don't add to the overall idea of the movie. They simply happen and then vanish without actually affecting the story. I guess you could argue that it was just trying to show what life was like in Iraq, but Iraq War veterans have already dismissed this movie as inaccurate Hollywood trite. So what's the point? The only thing that was interesting was at the end when Sgt. James is sent back home, gets sick of his routine civilian life, and returns back to Iraq. That's where the movie should have started because at least everything that would happen would somehow relate to the idea of ""War is a drug.""

This could have been something meaningful and substantial, but THE HURT LOCKER just settles for mediocre. I really want to like this movie because again it's a great idea. I feel like the movie is getting at something that I simply can't see because I'm probably too stubborn. Well, until I can see what it's going for, I still give this 2/5 stars.

PS: If you want a great movie about the War in Iraq, check out THE MESSENGER. That should have earned THE HURT LOCKER's recognition and accolades.",1307923200,2,3281,4.474123539232053

There are no one vehicle patrols.  A single team will never split up to gain more ground.  A intel specialist will never pick up a .50 caliber sniper rifle and pick some one off at over 800 meter. 99% of the time EOD blows the IED in place and they never wear bomb suites.  The infantry in this movie is portrayed laughible inacurate.  We don't hide inside of a courtyard waiting for EOD.  Most of the time, we would dispatch an IED ourselves by shooting it with our .50 cals.  It's not the recommended way of doing things and by no means an SOP, standard operation procedure, yet it is effective.  Afterall, EOD is extremely busy over there being there isn't to many of them, so a wait time could be upwards of 8 hours in Baghdad.  Moving on, A civilian vehicle would NEVER make it past a Checkpoint and if it maintained that speed as it approached the CP, we would have used esculation of force, from warning shots, to disabling the vehicle, to killing if necessary. EOD never travels alone downrange, they are always escorted by a platoon size element for protection.  We don't were badges down range like the combat infantry badge. We don't walk off Base... I could keep going trust me, but I'll leave it there.  However, it digusts me that the people who made this movie told the american people that this it's ""realistic"".  It's not, not even close. Hopefully, an Iraq War Veteran will tell their story some day and get it right.

It is ironic that the film is getting so much notoriety now due to the BitTorrent lawsuit.  My guess is that there are some sour grapes there from the producer having a film that was critically acclaimed but a flop in the box office.  I can think of some others that fall into the same category.  Get over it Voltage.  Personally I don't condone or use BitTorrent, but I think Voltage needs to go down in the annals of failed companies given that they can't accept a lackluster film's performance and, instead, believe it is someone else's fault.

3861380,2,B00275EGX8,"I admit I didn't watch the whole thing. I had to turn it off after the guy---no body armor, but ACU pants that weren't being issued at the time, which would have gotten him killed----left the base with a gun to a civilian's head.  As it happens, two of the guys in my squad did something like that just prior to us new guys arriving. They went to a party, they carried unauthorized weapons, and for most of the rest of the tour they were on extra duty and restriction. Then the insurgency exploded, and going outside the wire just became a laughable idea.

 Where do I start, where do I start? The part where the officer stands next to a big huge brand-new looking, definitely FULL burlap sack in the street and nobody notices RIGHT AWAY? Did I mention this guy's EOD? And it's 2004 in Iraq, when everybody learned exactly what IED meant? The one-vehicle excursion out into the desert? The mercenaries, also in one vehicle? Jeez, does Fallujah, April 4th, 2004 ring any bells? Aside from which, leaving base---in one vehicle for the soldiers, if not for the mercs-----was strictly forbidden, simply because it was the best way to get yourself killed. The soldiers knew this, too.  You had to have a convoy, you had to have a certain number of soldiers, certain numbers and types of weapons, and certain procedures. This wasn't drill and ceremony; this was stuff that would keep you alive. And any realistic soldier recognized that a lot of that stuff made sense.

  And then there's the scene where they get trapped by snipers in a building eight hundred meters away, who can blow away a merc with a tough shot yet can't take out the lead character's buddy once he takes off his helmet. And for that matter, they DON'T take out the guy who's taking them out. If they can see well enough to hit the turret gunner in the jugular then they can take out the dude who just took off his Kevlar.

  I had to turn it off. I'm going to guess it didn't get much better. The bottom line is, if you have to change the reality of the story that much to tell your story, there's something wrong with the story. That's the writer's fault, and sure it makes their job easy, but that's the job. This kind of laziness reminds me of way Stephen King uses telepathy in all his books because otherwise he'd have to actually explain certain things and write maybe three hundred more pages. You have to wonder why, if they want to write about the military so much, they make it so fake.

 Some people don't grasp this idea. It's honesty. It's hard work. Artistically, I'd say there's different kinds of honesty. There's every I dotted, every T crossed accuracy.  Then there's emotional honesty,  where you follow the spirit of something rather than the letter of it. This is what movie makers use a lot, yet this movie has neither. If you can't get the details right, the basic facts of military life, then something's wrong with your story.  It's not the military that's the problem; it's the fact that you can't get it right, that the story you want to tell can't be made to fit the framework you've chosen for it. A lot of civilians get the military wrong, thinking it's matter of picking which extreme to place the story at. But they miss all the gray areas in the middle, all the perfectly ordinary people in the military who do extraordinary things, and I think a lot of people flinch from that complexity.  Even today, members of the military are either saints or villains to people, and this movie was an attempt to capitalize on a third role: that of suffering---or angry---survivor. Yet Renner's character was just a smug, arrogant bad boy, more of a Tom Cruise character than anything original.

""Black Hawk Down"" which had its flaws, still remains the mark to beat, and this one didn't even come close.",1304899200,10,3791,4.535190615835777
3861391,1,B00275EGX8,"EDITED TO ABIDE BY AMAZON STANDARDS CONCERNING LANGUAGE AND INSULTS

Many years ago, practically in another life, I learned how to deactivate infernal devices.  Back in the 1980s EOD training focused primarily on unexploded ordinance rather than IEDs, and the stuff the IRA and PLO was putting together back then was downright primitive in comparison to some of the newfangled stuff our guys are facing now.  To put this in perspective, when I was at AIT cellphones hadn't even been invented yet.

Even back in primitive times, one of the most basic and fundamental rules you learn is to consider the MANY possible anti-handling devices you might encounter.  Often, even a simple mil-spec device such as a landmine could have several anti-handling devices in place, and with an IED it could get downright devious.  I'm not going to go into any detail here, but anti-handling devices are designed to kill anyone who discovers the device and attempts to render it safe.  Any entry-level Combat Engineer knows you're not supposed to lift, roll, jostle, or shake a suspect device without a complete and detailed inspection.  The genius in this film is dragging 50 pound shells out of the dirt by their wires and prying open the trunk of a car to expose the bomb inside.  In real life, bad guys use tamper resistant bombs.  Pull it out of the dirt?  BOOM.  Open a boobytrapped trunk, hood, or door?  BOOM.  Snip random wires?  Holy collapsing circuit!  BOOM.  These were the first things you learned 25 years ago!  Today, EOD school is three times as long and you are practically qualified for an electrical engineering degree when you are done.  This idiot would have washed out halfway through the first phase.  Risktaking is one thing, foolhardy bravado is another, but what this guy was doing guaranteed him a Darwin Award.  It is glaringly obvious that no-one with any actual EOD experience was used as a consultant for this film.

Wanton stupidity abounds, and to make things worse it isn't even an entertaining movie.  Unlikeable undeveloped characters, idiotic subplots that go nowhere, and no sense of reality.  Oh, I loved the scene when they are working the Barnett 50 which is a precision sniper rifle and they're sighting it in like an artillery piece, cleaning blood off the rounds to prevent it from jamming, and completely forget that there is an entire belt of ammo in the turret gun . . . but I digress.  Apparently, no-one who actually fired a gun was used to consult on this film either.  Ending sucked too.  Altogether, this was a dismal failure as a war movie.  Of course, the soulless drones in Hollywood and the Press Corps all think it is movie of the year deserving of numerous high awards.  This movie made me want to vomit.

First of all it's nice to see a movie set in a desert environment instead of the jungle lands of Vietnam (a war that's been well documented by this point).  That in itself is a nice refreshing change, and I believe we will continue to see more desert-themed war films in the future thanks to both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of the last several years.

No doubt in my mind the reason a (supposed) realistic storyline pertaining to the war in Iraq was created in the first place resulting in the Hurt Locker being released is because of all the Americans and British who sit here day in and day out wondering exactly what's going on over there.  I find out through reading some reviews here on amazon that the film isn't really that realistic though which is unfortunate.

What's most appealing about the Hurt Locker is the way it continuously keeps the audience guessing exactly when the explosions and gun bursts from the sneaky Iraqi enemies will occur.  They almost never happen during the times you THINK they will, and that alone is quite surprising.  The one exception is the man who had bombs wrapped around his chest and waist.  Yeah, you just knew he didn't have a lot of time left.

As far as the acting goes, well truth be told I've seen better.  It mainly sticks to a few select soldiers who are not necessarily buddies, but they gradually win over each others respect by frequently putting themselves in harms way and setting a mood filled with tension and fear.  They always look out for each other and live dangerously, that's for sure.  Respect is certainly earned as a result.

Overall, yeah, perhaps it could have been shortered by about 30-45 minutes, but I honestly wasn't bored at all.  A great film.",1299024000,,1820,4.577160493827161

As for realism, most of the plotholes more come from characters doing illogical things than doing things that aren't possible. Guess what? Characters making dumb decisions create CONFLICT. Movies need conflict.

All of the performances are excellent, especially Jeremy Renner, but Anthony Mackie was also snubbed at the oscars for a nomination. This movie also benefits from not having any stupid political messages that some war films try to ram down your throat. It's a piece of storytelling, not a political statement, and people it's not a documentary either. You gotta sometimes sacrifice facts for the sake of making an entertaining movie. Still it's good. No clear cut message. Not pro-war. Not anti-war. Just a story about a guy who likes a bit of adrenaline. The film also succeeds in having lots of very suspenseful scenes.

At the very least, this film succeeds in giving civilians awareness to the fact that EOD is a difficult, dangerous, and stressful job. I do know people in the military who have enjoyed this. Sometimes, you gotta think about the movie as art and simply how it functions as a piece of filmmaking. Braveheart wasn't accurate either, but lots of people love that one.

3861414,5,B00275EGX8,"HURT LOCKER, THE

STARRING: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse

WRITTEN BY: Mark Boal

DIRECTED BY: Kathryn Bigelow

Rated: R
Genre: Action / Thriller
Release Date: 26 June 2009

It pains me to say that I missed The Hurt Locker in theaters. On my first viewing of the film, I remember enjoying it but thinking it was not worthy of the Oscar for best picture over Up in the Air, Avatar or Inglourious Basterds. Having seen it recently for a second time that feeling remains intact; but now I can proudly consider it worthy of its place among the top five best films of 2009. If you haven't yet seen it, you seriously need to.

The Hurt Locker holds a place dear to me on a few personal levels. The first being that it is an independent film (a world that I myself am entering into); and the second is that its story centers on soldiers fighting in the Middle East (something of which I have experience in).

Jeremy Renner earns his first of two Oscar nominations as Sergeant James; an EOD bomb tech who is a little too proud of his work ethic for the comfort of his comrades. And for those of you who aren't familiar with the term EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), they are an elite group of soldiers whose sole mission is to find and disarm bombs. And I'll give you another one up front: an IED is an improvised explosive device. The story takes place back in a 2004 Baghdad, Iraq.

After their bomb tech is killed in an explosion, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are awarded with a new one: Sergeant James. Eldridge and Sanborn had a good thing going, they work by the book, and they're but a few weeks shy of going home.

So when James comes into the picture with his carefree tactics and cocky attitude; they are a little on edge. That James is efficiently skilled and gifted at what he does only makes matters worse for all three of them; because James is very aware that he posses these skills, and takes great joy in the adrenaline rush they reward him with.

Sanborn and James butt heads from the get-go and Sanborn quickly realizes his last few weeks are going to be among his longest. Imagine working with someone who is very good at what they do, but their cockiness is sure to get you and them fired, and they don't seem to be the least bit concerned. Now amp up the volume on that little scenario by replacing the word fired with the word killed.

James smokes frequently (even when handling dangerous explosive materials), he's all too eager to get his hands dirty when the situation doesn't necessarily call for it, and he doesn't seem to have much to live for other than the thrill of the job. And he likes to take his time when defusing these bombs, regardless of the fact that his team, himself included, are completely in the open and could be killed at any moment. The sheer fact that they are there to begin with, alerts massive suspicion to the townspeople.

As nuts as this may seem, ask yourself if you were holding security for someone defusing a bomb; if you'd like that person to be as comfortable as possible when doing so. This is James' take on his work ethic, and it makes perfect sense.

One thing you have to understand about the conflicts in the Middle East, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan; the battlefield is everywhere. There is no safe point or zone; some are safer than others, sure. There is no one outside the wire you can fully trust: the enemy could be anyone, anywhere at any time, and they don't play by the rules. Harmless seeming objects such as cell phones, video cameras, and even kites, all have the potential of being tools of deadly destruction over there.

The film rides on suspense driven scenes of: A. a guy defusing a bomb; and B. his security team surrounded by people who may want to kill them, may have the means to do so, and may be directly responsible and capable of detonating that very bomb. If that doesn't make for a good thriller, then I don't know what would.

The Academy Award winning screenwriter (Mark Boal) spent time in Baghdad with a real EOD team and the film proves it. He nailed every detail from the soldier favorite juice boxes, to the Military jargon, to the shocking realization of just how far these people are willing to go to hide their IEDs in innovative ways.

His goal here was not to make a big Hollywood action movie, but to tell a good story, and to stay true to the men and women who serve by keeping the film believable. There are a few Hollywood moments in the film for sure, but every single thing that happens could realistically happen in real life; maybe not to the same three guys, but hey.

Mark's efforts are only matched perfectly by director Kathryn Bigelow who also won the Oscar for directing. They could have taken this project to a major studio who would have given them millions of dollars to film it in Arizona or Nevada. But instead they sought out investors overseas and filmed the movie independently and properly in the Middle East; and their hard work and commitment has paid off. There are six little shiny gold men resting on glamorous shelves somewhere, to prove it.",1297641600,4,5183,4.5144076840981855

Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is new team leader in Bravo company of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit in 2004 Iraq.  He is a replacement for Staff Sergeant Thompson (Guy Pearce), who died from an IED in Baghdad. The other two member sof the team are James' guards who act as lookouts to prevent a follow-up ambush during bomb disposal, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This is the story of an elite specialist, not a grunt who took on military service because he was looking to prove himself.  The Hurt Locker asks: what kind of person becomes an expert at the most dangerous job in the world?

Sanborn and Eldridge count the days before their time is up - when they return home to their families, or when a sniper's bullet finally kills them.  Eldridge is nervous, jumpy, and on a slippery slope.  Sanborn is the consummate professional who goes by the book, but in a war torn land where few rules apply, James' flagrant disregard for safety rattles him.  Both men are convinced that James will be the death of them.

And they're right.  James is good at what he does because he defines his universe from within.  James decides to befriend a young boy he nicknames Beckham (Christopher Sayegh) because he reminds James of his son. When James discovers a child victim of terror, James decides - with no evidence whatsoever - that it's Beckham.  It doesn't matter if the child is actually alive or dead.  James' boundaries are constructed in his own mind, because the forces he work with are entirely unpredictable.  Calmly detached from his own reality, James decides the bombs won't go off because they haven't yet, that he will live because he's survived so far. In a fickle, cruel world, James' self-centeredness borders on sociopathy, but it's exactly the kind of mindset he needs to be so good at facing down death every day.

The problem is that supreme selfishness is not a trait that the military values.  What makes James an excellent bomb disposal expert makes him a terrible soldier in the field, and he nearly gets his team members killed in a misguided mission of revenge.

The Hurt Locker culminates in a standoff over a Iraqi civilian with a bomb strapped to his chest. The experience convinces Sanborn to return home and settle down, but it never penetrates the inward-looking sphere that is James' ego.

What makes the Hurt Locker so good is how it tells a story inward-out instead of outward-in. This is James' story first and foremost; everyone else, from his teammates to civilians to his own family, are just characters in his orbit.  And yet all those characters feel real. The Hurt Locker may be James' story, but it tells the plight of soldiers everywhere through sand, tears, sweat, and blood.",1296864000,4,3004,4.788759689922481

3861420,4,B00275EGX8,"`The Hurt Locker' looks at a bomb disposal squad during the Iraq war as they go about diffusing various roadside bombs and evade various traps and battles. It has plenty of tension throughout and the use of slow motion cinematography heightens the impact of some of the scenes, as bombs kick up dust, debris and spent gun cartridges cartwheel end over end. By the end this tension has made you see the war from the soldiers perspective a little more and you start to understand their outlook on danger and fighting, even if it makes you further question the involvement in Iraq. The typically gung ho American persona grates initially, but this soon fades as you become more involved in the film. You can see why this won the Oscar and the direction is very impressive and this ranks highly in films made so far about the Iraq war. If the Iraq war is going to spawn as many films as Vietnam did, then this is a decent enough addition to the genre. To be honest this isn't as good as I'd hoped, especially after all the hype (although it is a fairly decent film), and I can understand some of the apathy towards it, but as far as war films go this is very good and worth a viewing at some point.

But as a non-combatant who cares deeply about those who wear the uniform, the visceral power of this monumental film greatly overwhelms any flaws and makes it one of the best war films, period, about any war, ever.  Even for me, the foray into Baghdad and especially the pointless sequence in the desert were annoying detours: OK, they might use Barretts to detonate IEDs but surely they're not trained to sniper level; more ridiculously, however, the mercs, presumably ex-SAS, that they fought beside in that encounter would almost certainly HAVE been well trained on the Barrett and would never have been victimized by a distant insurgent who was clearly using an AK--which, at those ranges, would have been about as accurate as a smoothbore musket, not to mention the low training level of its shooter.  And of course, what about calling for air or other support?

But subtract those details and you have a magnificent, raw film.  Perhaps its most alluring aspect is the very narrow, yet compelling laser-sighted focus: what makes guys volunteer for a job like that?  And what on earth makes guys go back for another tour at EOD, or any extremely high risk duty?  This film provides the best exploration of that age old puzzle that I've seen so far.

If you know absolutely nothing about combat or technique and operating procedures (or common sense) this movie would appear to be realistic.

To believe the director, writer or any of the actors have really been in any kind of war is ridiculous. This film tries to be gritty and realistic but it just doesn't work. The direction and filming give it a gritty feel but he plot and actions of the main characters destroy the effect. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the director could not have spent more than a week in Iraq. The whole concept of the movie is too unrealistic to be taken seriously. Too bad the critics are so naive about the real world and the art of war(and it's brutal truth). Good movie but not an academy award winner. Kudos to trying to make a film with an impact, too bad it turned out to be so obviously unrealistic.. All in all a major let down from all the previous reviews.",1290211200,4,1381,4.335907335907336
3861443,4,B00275EGX8,"It's hard when you wind up sweeping all film awards in a particular year.  It is almost guarantied that you are going to experience major backlash.  It seems that that has happened for the surprise juggernaut that was `The Hurt Locker' (seriously, who the heck saw that coming).  The film is not experiencing the same criticisms that so many other `Best Picture' winners have received in the past (just look at the films average rating on this very site).

No, `The Hurt Locker' is not perfect.  In fact, I don't think it should have won the Oscar, even considering the Academy's underwhelming lineup (the film, while VERY good, is not better than Tarantino's masterpiece).  That said; this film is deserving of the praise and certainly undeserving of the backlash.

The film centers around a bomb diffuser named William James.  James is a wild one.  He needs to feel the adrenaline rush of near death that so many in his company want to avoid.  He is not afraid of danger.  William gets moved into a new squad when their former leader is killed in the line of duty.  William is unlike anything this squad has seen before, and he almost instantly gets under their skin (but not in a good way).  They have just barely over a month together, but in that month the three main characters (Will, Sanborn and Specialist) undergo many emotional changes.

Like most have already noted, this is not a war movie.  It reminds me in a way of Sam Mendes' underappreciated `Jarhead' in that it's main focus is on the men serving and not the service they perform.

So, I have a few squabbles with the film.  For me, war movies run a very sharp risk of becoming one note and redundant.  `The Hurt Locker' falls into that department at times.  It becomes almost repetitive in the situations these men find themselves.  Yes, there are differences, but they can run themselves together.  It isn't as present a problem as in some other films, but it is there (for me at least).  I also had some issues with the films handling of the `Beckham' (when you see the film you'll know what I mean).  When Will goes out of his way to find the men `responsible' for what he fears has happened it adds depth to his character but it kind of takes you out of the film a bit.  It just appears far too unrealistic for me.  The final scenes also have that feeling (would three soldiers really do that?) but they fare better because of the emotional turmoil and ending revelations they stir up (that clothed shower scene is FLAWLESS).

The films actual ending also felt a little `obvious', which I didn't care for.

I know it seems like I'm picking on this film a lot, but really, when taken in perspective these issues are small.  The film is gritty and earnest.  Sure, it has moments where the honesty seems stretched a tad thin, but the character never feel anything short of sincere and real.  The film is visually stunning and completely tuned into the adrenaline rush running through Will's body.  The relationship that builds between the three main characters is engaging and it breathes reality.  While I found some moments to feel a tad `preachy' (I wasn't fond of the repartee between Specialist and his counselor) I also appreciated that the film took an obvious step `away' from being a `message' film.  It just let you dwell in that world and decide for yourself what your really think.

Let's talk about Jeremy Renner.  What a brilliant performance.  Yes, he made it seem really easy (so it wasn't `wow look at me act' kind of brilliant) but that's what made it so brilliant.  It was honest.  Every smirk or hand gesture or sideways glance was completely lived in and real.  You never once doubted him and his commitment and his needs and his motives.  He wore everything on his sleeve, but not in the `obvious' way in which some actors approach a character.  He felt like you and me and everyone you know.  Anthony Mackie delivers his best performance to date.  I have an issue with him as an actor because he seems to play a variation of the same character in every film (or he at least brings the same facial expressions to every performance) but he actually develops Sanborn in a way that feels sincere.

Oh yeah, and the slew of cameos from greats like Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes were highly appreciated.

In the end this film is well worth your time.  It really works on many levels.  Sure, it isn't perfect (and `near-perfect' is even a stretch really) but it is forgivably flawed thanks to many elements (not the least of which was Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction...so much developed tension) that work just right.",1289779200,2,4621,4.613496932515337

What this movie gets wrong:
-Numerous technical issues, uniforms, equipment

What this movie gets UNFORGIVABLY wrong:
-The portrayal of Soldiers as undisciplined cowboys
-one vehicle convoys
-white light flash lights in the dark (essentially walking around with a bullseye on you)
-splitting up to cover more ground (a.k.a. suicide)
-sneaking off the FOB alone (just ask the Soldier being held by the taliban what a great idea this is, seriously what was he thinking?)
-EOD doesn't disarm IEDs unless they have to, 99% are detonated in place usually by remote controlled robot, not a guy in a bomb suit

If you are a civilian and want to see a decent portrayal of what Baghdad looks like (the scenery and Iraqis I mean)then watch the movie, if you've been there I wouldn't waste your time with this movie.

The best part was the end - because it was over. How anyone could compare this film with ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" is beyond me. As war movies go, it's more like ""Delta Farce"" or ""In The Army Now"" - except that those films are more realistic than ""The Hurt Locker.""

What this movie gets right, it gets very very right.

After I returned from Iraq (08-09) I had a hard time watching this movie.  A real hard time, because it would trigger memories, scenes looked like they were ripped right out of the snap shots I took while patrolling the streets of Baqubah.  There were times when I swore I could smell the stink that of that place as I watched the movie.  The sun, the sand, the trash all conspired to bring me back.  Fortunately, you can always hit the stop button on the DVD player and walk away, which I did several times before I was able to watch this movie all the way through.

It wasn't just the scenery.  It was the attitudes, and perhaps as an Army Reservist I have a bit of a different perspective than those who were on active duty and who came home.  But the product description gets it right too, War is a Drug.  I never felt more alive than I did when I was over there.  My life meant something.  I was doing something that mattered.  It was a high stakes game of life or death, the ultimate struggle between people, me and those who wished to do me harm.

To come home from that, to have to turn that mindset off was hard.  One of the most powerful scenes in the movie for me, was as he's standing there in the supermarket, standing there bewilderment and disbelief written on his face as he surveyed the rows of brightly colored boxes.  I relate to that moment more than any other moment in the movie.  That is what it gets right.

As the Best Picture Oscar winner of 2009, The Hurt Locker is definitely a good movie well worth watching...and an important movie about our current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a film that explores some of the psychological effects that modern warfare has on the soldiers fighting these wars, specifically the soldiers that disarm bombs. Our current wars don't have the same cut-and-dry sides that WWII did, when the good guys and bad guys were more clearly defined. But war is still war at its most basic levels, and every war means that the soldiers have to deal with killing and death.

My appreciation of The Hurt Locker has not changed in the last year since I first saw the film on DVD and reviewed it. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. Having now seen 6 out of the 10 nominated Best Picture films for 2009, along with a bunch of other 2009 films not nominated for Best Picture, I'm not so sure that The Hurt Locker deserved to win Best Picture of 2009. I do think it was deserving over Avatar, which was visually and technologically incredible, but empty in terms of its story and characters. But my pick for best picture of 2009 is the underrated and not nominated A Single Man by director Tom Ford, followed by (500) Days of Summer and Crazy Heart. And out of the group of war films in 2009, I think Brothers was just slightly better than The Hurt Locker, The Messenger, and Inglourious Basterds. But all 4 of these war films are worthy of viewing. It's not my intention to harp on whether or not The Hurt Locker was awards-worthy, but I thought I'd share my opinions here since I've now seen enough films from 2009 to render an opinion.

What I will emphasize that is brilliant about The Hurt Locker is the documentary-style cinematography and storytelling. Screenwriter Mark Boal, a journalist who was embedded with troops in Iraq during the war, brings a realism and depth to the story and its characters that feels authentic. Certainly parts of the movie are dramatized and Hollywood-ized as all fiction films are, but for the most part, you feel like you are right there in Iraq with the soldiers. The production design is flawless, with that same sun-bleached dusty desert look that we've become accustomed to in war movies about the middle east from the past 10 years. That look and feel really goes back to the excellent film Three Kings (1999), which was one of the first middle-eastern set ""war"" films, along with Courage Under Fire (1996). And it continued with Ridley Scott's excellent film Black Hawk Down (2001).

There is no doubt in my mind that Director Kathryn Bigelow deserved her Best Directing Oscar. She's a very talented woman in what is generally a man's field. And for her to have made the statements she's made with her films over the years, she deserves Academy recognition. And of course we were well overdue for our first female Best Director. I do think Point Break (1991) is her best film, with The Hurt Locker at #2. Her Oscar win, like so many, is really for her body of work. The Hurt Locker was simply the film that pushed her over the edge into winning.

As I mentioned in my previous review, the three main actors, led by Jeremy Renner, are very good in this film, even though their characters seem a little empty and distant at times. Of course one could argue that they are that way because that's how these soldiers are and have to be to do their job. They can't get too emotional or involved, but instead stay ""distant"" to protect themselves. I do buy that argument, but this is still a movie, and for me to care about the characters, I need to be able to understand and feel who they are and what they are up to. There are moments in the film that provide that, but they are connected by long spells without it.

The pacing and editing of The Hurt Locker are very solid and at times brilliant. Using multiple cameras to shoot various scenes in the film, the filmmakers apparently had a million feet of film to work from to create and edit this movie. So my hats are off to the editors working hard to chip away the best of all the material captured for this story. There are a few scenes where the tension and emotion are so palpable, that you just become fixed to your TV anxiously awaiting resolution. And it's those moments that elevate this film from the pack and make it good. This is simply one of those films you have to see if you're an American and a movie lover. There are definitely moments of cinematic brilliance in this film, evidenced by some of the still images below from the trailer. I just wish those moments added up to a little more.",1286323200,,4658,4.501182033096927

This movie is an adrenaline rush with knobs on. It takes you into a hyper-reality journey where just like the character, you don't know what's next. Except these aren't bikes. These are bombs. And unlike mindless action movies, its also a pure pychological labyrinth of the wordless expressions of mortality. A salient death wish that becomes an ally for how else can one accept the underlying destruction that waves its hand unless one has made friends with it.

Surrounding all of this is the obvious fear that bites at those that wish to get out alive. Such a medley of strange sensations to feel fear, love life, resent death but embrace annihilation. What a cocktail.

Even after the second or third viewing its was still reverberating with all the heightened sensations. Kathryn's a genius. Im so happy for her.",1285804800,3,974,4.785714285714286

3861467,4,B00275EGX8,"I have read some reviews from vets of Operations Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Iraqi Freedom.  I am an Air Force retiree who spent 27 years on active duty.  I understand why some of the discrepancies can be frustrating to those who have lived life in the military and see Hollywood not getting the details quite right.  I often note a lot of differences between life and life on screen in most movies with a military theme.  Uniforms aren't correct, haircuts are out of regulation, people wear hats indoors etc.

However, with ""The Hurt Locker"", theses discrepancies shouldn't take away from the excellence of the movie.  The main theme of the movie is not about the details of existence in day to day military life in a war zone.  The director is trying to show how the effects of the cat and mouse existence in this type of combat affect the key characters.  Also of importance is the relationships between them.  The acting by the the trio who make up the Explosive Ordnance Disposal--EOD--team (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) is excellent.  I can certainly relate to how Jeremy Renner's character, Sergeant James, feels when he goes home to his wife and child after tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.  You get the feeling that he can't adapt to the humble role of husband and father and actually misses the near addiction he has to the adrenaline rush of being the key EOD team member.  You also get the feeling he can't and won't be able to find anyone to relate to his experiences.  I grew up in Iowa and when I came home on leave, I really couldn't talk about my assignments with friends and family because they had no real concept of what I was talking about.  The pain within the story primarily comes from the two other members of the EOD team, who are really just trying to survive their tours and get away from a job they dislike in a country (Iraq) they hate--hopeful to get home in one piece.

In addition to the superb acting by the three lead characters, the cameo appearances by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes added an air of actor familiarity and credibility; and the astute direction of Kathryn Bigelow brought the story and characters together brilliantly.

I did knock off a star for the discrepancies some other reviewers pointed out, but I think this film is deserving of the many accolades it received, including the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and should be viewed by anyone interested in the effects of war on the psyche of some of those involved.",1285372800,2,2519,4.652370203160271

3861471,3,B00275EGX8,"When I pushed PLAY, I expected to be as spellbound as others who had seen this movie and reported the drama here on Amazon. With such high expectations, the only way to go is usually south, and that's what it did.

The acting of Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie make them first-class Thespians. They play the part of non-commissioned officers who are in the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD. It is evident that SSG James finds the adrenaline rush of outsmarting bomb makers and defusing their work. He tempts fate like the matador who moves ever closer to the horns of the bull. He removes his helmet and other life-saving equipment meant to protect him in case of a bomb blast. It looks like he is about to lose his sanity when we are exposed to a scene revealing his humanity, which I will not expound upon. It would be giving away too much of the story.

The most effective part of the movie is his return to family life and the mundane chores expected of a husband and family man. There is no excitement in removing the leaves that are blocking the drainage trough at the roof. As an EOD expert, he had to make split-second decisions that could have cost him his life or that of his comrades, yet he looks utterly confounded by the cereals in the aisle when his wife asks him to get one. This is one thing that is not talked about when it comes to veterans returning home. Many will have experienced awesome levels of responsibility for men and materiel that cannot be duplicated in civilian life, and it can be a sudden and tremendous letdown for the ego.  How SSG James deals with this dilemma becomes obvious by the end of the film.

If a film spends so much time trying to get into the heads of soldiers under the constant strain of combat, the rest of the surroundings should be equally realistic. This was sloppily addressed with the wrong uniforms, insignia, improper military courtesy, and lack of vehicle markings.  Leaving their posts to chase insurgents with flashlights was appallingly stupid. But what I wondered most about was this ""autonomous team.""  They seemed to be more rogue than Sarah Palin, and I began to wonder if they reported to anyone or selected their missions by themselves. If I had been stationed there as an EOD and had my choices, I would have spent my whole tour at the compound's Subway, Baskin-Robbins, or the movie theater.

The film starts in ""Bagdad 2004"". American soldiers arrive at a street. A robot machine inspects a pile of rags. Goats roam in the streets. A wheel falls off a cart, a soldier dresses in protective gear to inspect the bomb. A man fingers a cell phone, the bomb explodes. A package is sealed for shipping. We see another patrol on the streets to check for a reported bomb. A car goes past the troops, then stops. The soldier disarms the fuse on the bomb. But there are six more! They are disarmed. Some soldiers play video games. Peddlers sell DVDs. Later there is another car to inspect. A shot causes a fire. ""He's not going to make it."" The truck is filled with 155mm shells. The wires are cut. He searches for the main fuse and cuts it. ""873!""

There is talk with an advisor. There's more drama at an explosion site. They find four armed men with an SUV in the desert. There is an ambush! A sniper hits soldiers from a distance. Can they reach him? A jammed magazine is cleared. They wait to aim again. One soldier spots an insurgent crawling along the bridge by the goats. They later relax with rough humor. The specialist collects souvenirs. The conversation reveals their past lives. [Does loneliness cause drinking?] The Colonel goes for a ride. They search an abandoned building. They find a load of explosives and a dead body. ""What is he doing?"" A bomb hits the Colonel! Could a DVD merchant be a spy for the insurgents?

The specialist gets a ride to a house. Who was responsible for ""Beckham""? He flees the house. James is summoned for a new mission. People flee from a ""suicide bombing"". Or was it a remote detonation? They search the alleys. A burst of gunfire is a warning. The soldier is rescued, but wounded. A man with bombs strapped to his body walks towards the American lines. Is it a trap? Can the harness be removed in time? ""I hate this place."" The year is over. Back home he visits a supermarket. Is this what he was fighting for? ""The older you get the fewer things you really love."" [Is that true?] Will he return for another tour of duty?

This film is a pseudo-documentary with little drama in it. Does it have a lesson? Was it designed to straddle the line between pro-war and anti-war so an audience could read their own feelings into it? ""War is a drug"" is just nonsense. Wars are fought to exploit property and people. Whenever you read about conflict over some barren desert you can be sure there is mineral wealth involved.

3861491,5,B00275EGX8,"The ratings of this movie are surprisingly all over the place, so I read many reviews to try to understand why.  It appears that a major area of contention is whether this movie is sufficiently realistic.  A number of people with military experience, including some with experience in Iraq, argue that the movie is too unrealistic, but their complaints often focus on technicalities which, though not always trivial, perhaps aren't too important for the typical non-military viewer.  And there are also a number of military people who find the movie quite realistic, so it seems that the experiences of military people vary substantially.  Considering all of this, my sense is that the movie reasonably faithfully portrays at least the essence of the experiences of at least some military people, so it's accurate enough for its purpose.

If so, I found this movie to be a powerful and riveting depiction of why ""war is hell,"" including ""war"" which is actually occupation.  On the American side, our troops face a situation where they often can't tell friend from foe, they can die very unexpectedly and suddenly, and they're constant witness to destruction and death, including the death of people who become their friends.  On the Iraqi side, they have the natural resentment, bitterness, and defiance of people who are being occupied by a foreign power.  Never before have I had a such a clear sense of why war must be avoided unless there's truly no other reasonable option.

This leads to the issue of whether the movie has a political message.  Many reviewers have argued that it doesn't overtly have such a message, and I agree. But, at the same time, by depicting how pointless and detrimental the occupation of Iraq is, with suffering on all sides, the movie does help to clarify why we never should have gone into Iraq in the first place, and why we need to get out ASAP.  Let's remember that inspectors had already failed to find any WMDs after extensive searching, there was never any credible link between Iraq and 9/11, and there was never any credible evidence or argument showing that Iraq posed a genuine threat to the US.  By going in there, all we've done is destabilize Iraq and open the floodgates of civil war, cause a huge loss of life on all sides, expend many billions of dollars (which we obviously can't afford), and make America LESS safe.  The only parties which seem to have benefitted are the defense contractors who have made tons of money at the expense of the American public (you and me).  If we really want to ""support our troops,"" we need to get them out of harms way and bring them home to their families, rather than asking them to endure enormous hardships and risk their lives for a conflict which makes no sense.

Anyway, getting back to the movie, my point is that the movie vividly illustrates the basis for my comments.  Very highly recommended.",1281225600,24,2890,4.7730923694779115

The story is about one of the most unconventional of soldiers:  the EOD expert (better known in the civilian world as the ""bomb squad guy"").

The movie has more of a feel of a documentary than it does a movie that has a linear plot.  The main character is an amazingly competent diffuser of bombs, but is also a person who lacks common sense and social skills.  He is so adept at deactivating bombs, and yet he is clueless about relations with his girlfriend, and something as banal as shopping for cereal @ the grocery store makes him very uncomfortable.

The veracity of the this film has been criticized by people who are far more qualified to challenge its realism than I am.

Some have said this is unrealistic.  I would disagree.  No matter whether the soldiers are EOD specialists, Rangers, Delta Force or whatever, there's a good chance they have strong parental insticts.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that it's many times strong parental instincts are one of the things that drive them to become soldiers in the FIRST place.  They want to leave a better, safer world behind for their family / children.  So, I would contend that the criticisms of this aspect of the movie are unwarranted.

The two worst scenes are when the soldiers are sniping some militants in the desert and even though they're shooting people there is no change of expressions on their faces whatsoever- just like they're doing a job. If you can call this a subplot, the hero James befriends some Iraqi boy making a connection with him. Later the hero finds him stitched up with an explosives inside him. Unfortunately, even though you think it would reveal some of the hero's character, it just doesn't go anywhere. Apparently, an academy award means nothing these days, the only indication that a film may be good is how much it makes at the box office. This was a 12 million dollar bomb. Even though it won an award, this movie is so vacuous it may actually be one of the worst movies ever made.",1279843200,4,1260,4.412017167381975

3861513,2,B00275EGX8,"I waited some time for the hype around this to die down so as to be able to go into it with a completely clear mind, not that my analysis of a film is weighed down too heavily by reviews and comments of friends, but it just seemed the right path to take.

She's a versatile director to say the least; Near Dark, Strange Days, Point Break and now the multiple Academy Award winner the Hurt Locker.

Jeremy Renner plays some dude who is uber addicted to the rush of disarming bombs because he doesn't love anything in the normal mundane life of the people who don't want to waste their time trying to fix an unsolvable problem like the assbackwards folk in the middle east. He's not a particularly good leading man, he's fantastic in Dominik's 2007 the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, so perhaps he should stick to side characters, or he's still honing his skills for a superb breakout performance. His character treats each mission like a cheap whore after having gone sexless for about a month; there's that over excitement at the beginning, the actual event, and then the afterwards where he seems completely detached from everything that happened.

I won't go so far as to say that the film is apolitical, but as far as war movies go this is probably the closest a fictionalized account of events has gotten to *ahem* fair and balanced.

There are some genuinely interesting moments, and some genuinely stupid ones; the good would be the first few bomb missions, the moments that made me roll my eyes was the shower scene, (really? one of those? ""oh no, I need to cleanse myself of the horror, weehhh.""), the specialist, while playing Gears of WAR (get it?) going on his little pissfit about ""now he's dead, now he's alive."" and the absolute worst moment of the film: the last few minutes.

All I could think to myself at that point was: ""here we had an okay film nearly ruined by an ending that makes it seem like the directorial reigns were handed over to Michael Bay.""",1278979200,2,1997,4.5515320334261835

I can appreciate the attempt at detail for a soldier's life in Iraq but for a movie to succeed, it still needs a story and interesting characters.  We never get a sense or where they are, what city, or anything about the local population. The movie is shot ""hand held"" style with fast ""news footage"" like zooms and shots and this tend to keep the viewing oscillating between feeling its a documentary versus a dramatic presentation.

3861516,4,B00275EGX8,"There many movies that have depicted the world of war. The past has given us a very glorified, Hollywood picture. Movies from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to 'Inglorious Basterds' have show us good vs. evil, fancy dialogue etc. War is always taken out of context in cinema, but there are very few that give us something real.

'The Hurt Locker', now known as the best picture of 2009 is one of those movies that is not bent on giving us a glorious picture, rather they strip war down to its true, gritty roots and in this movie we see the mental anguish that soldiers go through in modern day war. This movie takes us into the lives of a battalion that has been sent into Iraq to patrol the streets in search of terrorists and suicide bombers. In the middle of their rotation they are given a new squad leader that is a bit off color when it comes to the seriousness of their cause. He is unruly and at times treats it like a game. While some would consider characteristics such as this offensive because of the real people out there today fighting this war, there is some realism to those actions. There are people that have gotten so wrapped up in this war they try to turn into something else just to keep going as they battle the enemy. The film is very tense and at times not for the faint hearted. Still, it is not suppose to be war is real and war can make you feel all sorts of emotions you never thought you had inside you. One of the things that I appreciated about 'The Hurt Locker', was the fact that not all Arab people are depicted as bad, and that those who happen to be good in nature are thrown into terrorist acts against their will and sometimes they lose their own lives.

'The Hurt Locker', is not meant to be a cinematic legend in its field, nor was it made to be one of the greatest films of all time. I feel this movie was created to send a very important message about the war we are currently fighting and war in general. We have brave men and women who fight for freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield. More importantly, it shows how all that these souls want to make sure that in the end they are able to go home.",1278115200,3,2240,4.206976744186046

These shotgun lawsuits inevitably catch the innocent (Google it, you'll see), but this is something the morons behind Hurt Locker consider acceptable collateral damage, I suppose.

Sanborn and Eldridge are cookie-cutter and while I got the feeling the whole time that I was supposed to sympathize with and care about James, I'm really just confused. Why did he seem hell-bent on killing himself and his men? Was he just anti-social and quirky or was there something more to his eccentricities? Was Beckham really alive or was he hallucinating? They never really say, and while I'm no stranger to open interpretation, here it's really just frustrating. The dialogue was generally bland and there wasn't much in the way of plot. The action sequences were visually interesting, but drawn-out rather than suspenseful. I never really got the sense that anyone was in any sort of real danger. It was mostly just waiting and panning back to more waiting. The 1080p transfer is sharp, though in a few instances, the contrast between clean and grainy shots was a bit much. The audio is pretty stunning when there's something to listen to - explosions are fully realized and gunshots resonate well - and even in slower scenes (and there are plenty) the rear speakers always have something to do and proximity is handled quite well.

3861545,2,B00275EGX8,"I can be a bit of a film snob.  Anyone who knows me personally (or who reads anything I post on Amazon) will agree with that.

When ""The Hurt Locker"" built momentum towards the 2008-2009 awards season, I expected at least a good movie.  I know that one man's masterpiece is another man's overrated piece of garbage.  But I pretty much like everything.  I can justify just about any movie's existence, even if I don't care for it.  When it comes to movies I don't like, I can at least understand why many others love it.

""The Hurt Locker"" is a failure, pure and simple.

I have watched this film 6 times, and I've given up trying to play devil's advocate for it.  I don't understand its message.  I don't understand its power.  I don't understand its greatness.  I don't understand its critical praise and reputation.

You may ask, ""Then why do some people like it?""
There are 2 reasons I came up with: Craft and Context.

In terms of craft, ""The Hurt Locker"" on a production and casting level is just fine.  Kathryn Bigelow (or her camera team) show some neat shots here and there.  The lead performances are fine, with Jeremy Renner working his heart out to bring his character to life.  And when the explosions go off, they look good.  There is a pretty decent sniper sequence about midway through the film, with finally some life breathed into the story.

Boy, I wish I had more good things to say than that short paragraph.

I suppose that brings me to the Context in which critical praise comes in.
It's very simple: The critics and audiences that enjoyed ""The Hurt Locker"" are bringing more to the moviegoing experience than the movie is giving back.  I've read comments like:
""It's a portrait of how soldiers are fueled on adrenaline.""
""It provides a fair reality of why we're in Iraq.""
""It's about the bravery of the men and women who serve our military.""

I don't disagree with those ideas, but ""The Hurt Locker"" doesn't tell you any of that.  Critics and audiences who believe there is a deeper message within ""The Hurt Locker"" cannot provide a single piece of dramatic evidence where the movie says any of that.  I don't say that as an attack on liberals, conservatives, patriots, or anarchists.  This is an attack on people who've brought their own personal politics and patriotism to a movie that is simply very light on plot, drama, and purpose.  The individuals who praise this movie are not playing fair with those of you have not seen this film.

You ever watch a murder mystery and wonder, ""How in the world was I supposed to guess that he/she could've commited the crime""?  Ever see a plot twist in a film and say, ""But if I watch this movie from the beginning again, this twist doesn't make sense""?

That's what it's like listening to the high accolades of ""The Hurt Locker"", and then sitting down and watching it.  How do I know if ""The Hurt Locker"" glorifies war or doesn't?  How do I know that this story of 3 men (and a few others) is --- or isn't --- a representation of our military?

I think the reason for all of this rambling is because either Mark Boal's screenplay is VERY thin, or Kathryn Bigelow & her crew failed to bring it life.  I'm going with the former because Bigelow is very capable of making a good action picture, and has experience with deep screenplays.  Mark Boal is new to the big leagues, and I'm sure writing his own observations into a script must've been a joy.  But it's not a joy for me, and I don't believe ""The Hurt Locker"" will stand the test of time.

The film just isn't that interesting.  The trio of soldiers get a bomb report, go out, defuse the bomb as best as they can, talk a little bit later.... RINSE, REPEAT.  There is not dramatic arc here.  There is little character development, and very little of it interesting.  The biggest character arc involving Jeremy Renner's lead role makes absolutely no sense when put it all together.  So you see, when logic fails, presentation is everything.  And I'm afraid some heated photography, some neat sound effects, and some machismo soldierly intensity aren't enough.  After all, how many different ways can you make a bomb interesting outside of the technical level?

I am proud of our armed forces.  I am proud that ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the first films to put politics aside when exploring our Iraw presence.  And I commend Kahtyrn Bigelow, the cast, the crew, and even Mark Boal for getting their independent feature off the ground so that audiences could see it.

But all of these compliments should've gone to a much better film.  After 6 viewings, I was hoping to find it.  However, I think this is one of the most critically-overrated films in a very long time.",1275696000,7,4685,4.54665071770335

I support the military but the actors just didn't develop for me to care about them. The film is heavy, long periods of filler, and should have been more cohesive. Unlike Platoon, it was if they didn't have any fear about defusing bombs.

The military scenes where they go into a building showed soldiers not checking for snipers or others while standing near open windows. Remember the Aliens Sgt. saying, ""Check those corners. Check those corners!"" Of course, these guys just walk into a bomb shop. Trip wires? Oh, not in this film. Trip wires are attached to bombs that blow up soldiers going through an enemy's camp or territory. In Predator, they checked for trip wires. Guess Iraq had none.

3861665,3,B00275EGX8,"Hurt locker is a weird film. It's focused around the role of  many times forgotten personage in the war, this expert in deactivating deadly, mortal and  sophisticated weapons.

Irak, 2004. In the first third of the film we will assist to a sort of documental account. First dealing with the deactivation of two weapons, then the massacre in the desert and finally realizing that nothing can make it to save the life of a n innocent. During the adagio of the film we will watch how these guys spent their free time, and we'll witness how the fraternity of this antihero with a sympathetic child will become an act of personal justice when this boy be murdered by the enemy.

The spontaneity of the script is probably its main strength. One can feel that the hazardous and tensional moments are by themselves the dramatic core of the film. Dislike Platoon, for instance, there're not philosophical gestures or the well accustomed dichotomy between the good guys and the bad guys.

In Vietnam, you could see your enemy through the eyes of the jungle, but under the inclement heat of the desert, the enemy is invisible. You have not a direct contact with it and so, we have a kind of technological conflagration. You fight against the mortal device not with the enemy, and if case you deal with it the nocturnal sequences demand from you other tactics and procedures.

Kathryn Bigelow made an admirable and nervous camera handle, remarking (as Petersen did in Das boot) the anguishing frenzy of being dead or alive in question of seconds where a false movement is just the difference.

The film simply doesn't pretend to become a denounce film. It presents us without anesthesia (and in this sense it reminds us to Black hawk) the real situation on the battlefield where the enemy is always behind innocent people used as shield in the most of cases.",1274054400,,1846,4.73208722741433

As a work of art, and a work of pure psychology, it blew me away (pun not intended).  Some items I couldn't relate to, but others brought me back to Baghdad.  The way they portrayed the Iraqis was really very good.  The kids, the way that everybody was in every direction, never knowing who wants to kill you, it was disturbingly accurate.  I liked the transition at the end (spoiler coming) of the battle tested veteran shopping for cereal.  It really spoke to me.  Don't look at this picture as a 100% accurate description of the war.

The problem is the story. It's unfinished. It leaves too many questions unanswered. I know some movies let the viewer use their imagination, but this technique is generally used sparingly. In Hurt Locker, I don't know what happened on quite a few plot points.

- Did the butcher with the cell phone get caught?
- Was the little boy who played soccer killed, or was that him asking to play soccer later in the movie?
- Were the two guys they shot (that were dragging their squad-mate down a dark street) the ones who set off the big bomb?

3861716,1,B00275EGX8,"This is the most laughable war movie ever. Nothing in the movie is correct, and it plays out more like what a typical FoxNEWS viewer who's never been in Iraq would picture the war to be like. There is a mishmash of PTSD, lots of crying, some fighting, horrific displays of ""tactics,"" and a slight delve into soldiers favorite slur: hajji which is portrayed as a significant emotional event by the one guy who says it. A more accurate title for this movie would be ""Hallmark Presents: IRAQ! The After School Special.""

Aside from the ludicrous plot, complete disregard for any sort of military accuracy, and ho-hum backdrops (when Black Hawk Down's recreation of Mogadishu, Somalia looks more like Iraq than the Hurt Locker, there might be a problem), the Hurt Locker greatly suffers from terrible acting. The main character played by Jeremy Renner, is the only actor who really looks like he is trying. His supporting cast plays every cliche in the book from ""Scared-Teenager"" to ""Partner who Wants To Be Tough But Lives In Fear"" to ""Cowboy Colonel"" to ""Crusty Mercinary, or Maybe He's Special Forces, I Don't Know Because He Wasn't Introduced, Oh Wait Now He's Dead."" The movie tries to be everything. It tries to put its Explosive Ordinance Disposal team through EVERYTHING from disarming bombs to executing ludicrous attempts at infantry tactics, to engaging in a sniper battle instead of focusing and developing a strong plot on a narrow band of topics.

Eventhough it was easily one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, I will give credit where it is due. The hurt Locker does have a very good ending. If you don't want it spoiled because somehow you still want to watch this filmschool project gone awry, stop reading. If you've decided to take my advice, here is the spoiler: The Hurt Locker's ending is the conclusion of the movie's opening statement that war is a drug. Renner's character returns home and realizes that he misses Iraq, he misses the thrill one can only get from constantly living in constant danger, with people trying to kill you. He picks up his son, and then it cuts to him reporting to a new unit for another tour in Iraq. This was probably the only well done part of the whole movie, and I have yet to see another movie touch on it, which more should.

3861718,5,B00275EGX8,"There's no story, no heroic plot to Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker. There's no search for prisoners, no tracking of a villain, no hostages to rescue, no hill to liberate, or town to capture, or even a search for looted gold. There's not even an overarching allegory of life or war built into the theme of the movie. Despite this lack of war movie plots The Hurt Locker is still compelling with the only goal of the characters, is to stay alive.

The Hurt Locker follows the lives of a team of EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit members, Sergeant First Class Will James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Gerahty) as they finish the last five weeks of their deployment in Iraq. Their job in Iraq is to defuse IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices) and after their first Sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed Staff Sergeant William James is assigned to the unit. Sanborn and Eldridge discover that James takes more risks in the field than their previous Sergeant and is addicted to the adrenaline surge of war which is putting them at risk. They find themselves in the position of finding out if they can live (literally) with James' approach to the job.

Kathryn Bigelow's direction isn't heavy handed and neither does she use a heavy hand in imparting themes or other usual theatrical devices. The Hurt Locker is a very naturalistic representation of the Iraq war zone. While it touches on aspects of war that other movies have, such as the surreal aspect of war that Apocalypse Now illustrates or the dual nature of war that's found in Platoon, she lets them exist as a natural part of the world the characters find themselves in. This low key, naturalistic approach is also evident in the actor's portrayal of their characters. There's no big emotional blow ups between them, no huge revelations of a characters' back stories to pull on your heartstrings. The film highlights just what occurs naturally from the job they're there to do. The movie also doesn't take a political stance on the war. It's neither anti-war nor pro-war. It puts the viewer in the situation with the characters and you're free to feel or have whatever reaction the events stimulate in you. Bigelow even sparingly uses a soundtrack. It's more of a tense buzzing that keeps us feeling a little uneasy, as must soldiers in the field feel.

The Hurt Locker was written by Mark Boal who had been an embedded reporter with an OED unit in Iraq in 2004. While the story is fictionalized, many of the events shown were based on actual events Boal either witnessed or heard about from soldiers in the field.

Bonus Features: The Hurt Locker DVD has a small bonus feature section that includes an audio commentary that I found a bit lackluster, but I thought was more than compensated for with an image gallery section that includes a Q and A session from the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. And there is a behind the scenes documentary that I found myself wishing there was more of.",1272153600,3,3009,4.758620689655173
3861719,5,B00275EGX8,"From an account by New Yorker journalist Boal,a reporter embedded with an IED unit in Iraq we get this realistic account of Bravo Company, a trio of bomb squad technicians,Sgt William James(Renner),Sgt. Sanborn(Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge(Geraghty) who have 38 days left to serve before they go home from this cycle of duty. Bigelow has crafted a series of incredibly tense moments(with accuracy) without a satisfying overall cohesion to string them together. We are done with ideology,heroics,politics,just a grounded sense of being in Baghdad,Iraq when any moment a bomb(IED) or sniper or suicide bomber can snuff you out. There is a count down of time which organises the scenes,the time they are there,the time between finding and defusing a bomb,the time it takes for a timer device to go off on an unwilling suicide bomber. Bigelow pulls off a remarkable feat with a series of 4 hand-held cameras,swivelling in all directions,and Ackroyd's cinematography. Story and plot are minimal,situation, suspense and unpredictability of event are major factors and the adrenalin pumping through Sgt James's veins. The development of the 3 main characters in Bravo's EDO is just enough to take you through each tense scenario. Eldridge runs on fear and desperation(having to see the psychologist),Sandborn wants to do things by the book, hating uncertainty and poor communication,and James often takes unnecessary risks,endangering his men. He does this by suiting up like an astronaut all the time instead of sending in the Bot,he then often takes his headset off or his suit,while doing a job,while his men scan nearby balconies or roofs. There are booby-trapped cars and blown up tankers. Every Iraqi,child or goat is a potential bomb,every mobile phone may set one they are dealing with off. Sgt James has the calmness of a psychopath while dealing with detonators and wires and yet he has a good relationship with an Iraqi boy selling DVDs or playing football. One of the best scenes is in a desert shoot-out with insurgents, emphasising duration,sweat,solidarity,especially when Sgt James gets Eldridge to clean blood out of bullets to be fired in a Barret rifle and the sharing out of drinks,the heat,the sand and the grit. The contrast is well made with civilian life at the end of the rotation when Sgt James shops for cereal in a supermarket and plays with his son,but is soon back in the field. I noticed there was not a lot of army back-up around,nor army vehicles. I know Bigelow did not get any support from the services nor funding and yet created this sense of a big subject. The disorientation of walking through rubbish-strewn streets which have been emptied and watching eyes. The emphasis is on the interaction of the characters,the macho horseplay,moments of uncertainty and reflection,and the cold,hard possibility of being blewn to oblivion. The two least likely scenes - James going off into the night to look for`Beckham's' house,and him searching with his fellow soldiers back alleyways on the outer circumference of a bomb blast to find a bomb insurgent.

3861734,1,B00275EGX8,"Early on, I read the praise of multiple reviewers in Seattle, so I went to the limited-release showing of THL witha friend. We were both terribly disappointed.
Perhaps Bigelow's direction is good, I don't know; the script however, is ridiculous, as is (therefore) the praise it gets.
Would a ""Lethal Weapon"" movie be called an 'honest look at a cop's life'? Would anyone seriously describe a ""Die Hard"" film as gritty and realistic? Of course not.
The actions of the main character are beyond unbelievable, they're farcical: This guy is a bomb-defuser who faces no repercussions for his constant disobedience and insubordination; his refusal to follow protocols and obey commands indicate he's losing touch and becoming cavalier about his life, existing on the rush of walking the razor's edge over death. But they also depict someone who would have long ago run afoul of superiors, and if not been demoted and punished, then discharged from the Army.
To avoid spoiling scenes and events (though I'd be doing you a favor), I'll just remind you that nobody would consider it great filmmaking to have Arnold dodge bullets in a charge toward his enemies, then deliver a catch-phrase before landing a knockout punch to the bad guy. On the other hand, when this character does equivalently surreal and fantastic things throughout this movie, it challenges credibility and deteriorates the whole of the film - but this apparently strikes critics as terrific art.

3861736,2,B00275EGX8,"I watched this film after it won the Academy Award and was really puzzled by the acclaim it got. It's not really a very good movie. The main problem is how completely unbelievable the actions of the main character were. He just keeps initiating dangerous, unauthorized actions that place himself, his unit and the war effort itself in needless jeopardy, usually with no explanation or apparent reason.  The audience is left to guess that he's working out his own deeply-rooted psychological issues, but it seems highly unlikely that the military would allow anyone to keep going rogue like that: contrary to the filmmaker's mythic vision, there are rules of engagement and a chain of command in the military -- that's the way things work.  Sure, a lot of errors and bad judgment calls were made in the Iraq war, but I doubt they looked anything like this, and besides, the filmmaker seems to be saying that all this guy's crazy rule-breaking was a *good* thing, just the sort of wild, intuitive cowboy-upping that we'd need to win the war. Sounds like BS to me -- the military wins by disciplined, methodical action, having a clear game plan so that when things do get chaotic, you can still prevail.

Speaking of chaos, the film itself seemed rather poorly made, particularly in key action sequences, such as the bomb defusing outside the UN compound: just what the heck is going on in that scene?  Mostly, all I could tell was that a certain level of tension was established, after which the motivations and actions of various participants were rather unclear, and then after several poorly-choreographed minutes, the scene ended and we were told to go on home, nothing left to see here. I thought the script was pretty weak, the execution kind of clumsy and the editorial viewpoint rather unclear. Most, though, it's just not very believable that the US military would put up with the showboating and insubordination of the main character: they would just demote him and have some other guys do the work instead.

3861737,5,B00275EGX8,"If you're looking for a war movie filled with action, blood, dope-taking, brutality towards the enemy, and the like, this is not for you.  Suspense, however, there is. Edge of your seat suspense, created not only by the plot, this is about defusing bombs before they blow everyone up, but also by the cinematography.  Feet walking forward, first one booted foot, then another. Will the next step cause a hidden bomb to detonate?  We do see detonations, and they are awesome.  What is different about this war movie, set in Iraq, is it's not about seeing how many people our troops can  kill, but how many lives the bomb squad can save, even the lives of the ""enemies,"" who are not soldiers.  The movie echoes the weird situation in Iraq.  We are ""fighting"" an enemy without an army, and no reasons are given for our being there in the first place. The Iraqis we see are shepherds and peddlers and hustlers just trying to get by.

The movie opens with the statement that ""War is a drug"" you get addicted to.  The protagonist is addicted to it, both to the danger of defusing bombs, and to being able to save lives.  When his tour is over, this self-assured young man is seen bewildered in the cereal aisle of a market in the US.  This is not his life.  Defusing bombs is.

The cinematography is excellent, showing the washed out vistas of the desert and the shimmering of the heat.  The forward tracking shots heighten the suspense.  It is not an anti-war film per se.  Rather, it is taken as a given that this ""war"" is senseless, but the soldiers who are there, do their duty without heroics or stunts.  One of the virtues of owning the disc is that we've been able to re-watch it to get all of its subtleties.  It stands up to repeated viewings.

Where to start?  The lead character is both unlikeable and unsympathetic.  Those characteristics by themselves would not be such a problem if he wasn't also so unrealistic.  Tom Cruise as Maverick in Top Gun was more believable as a Naval Aviator - and that is saying something.

The story is just not that interesting.  Action substitutes for plot.

Finally the technical aspects stink.  The closest thing to realistic EOD was the opening sequence.  Real EOD techs are cautious by nature, they have to be.

NICE. Nothing about vague words like Honor or Patriotism. The men were there to do a job save lives, and they tried to do it well and go home. It nicely captured the stress from the prolonged exposure to danger and deployment! What I like though is that there was no mentioned of either the word ""Stress"" or ""Duty"", unlike other war movies. But as a package, the subtle signs are there for all to see.

I found the lead review by DarthRad, titled ""Taut war drama exploring the psychology of soldiering"" by fairly relevant. Hence I will only share certain aspects that I think was not answered in that review.

Q&A
Why did Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) prefer combat than family?
Probably to the man, its either you dismantle the bomb or you don't. No grey areas, unlike when it comes to family and love. He did not communicate well with the wife, though he loved her and the baby. (He tried calling her from Iraq, but don't know what to say).

Why did Sergeant James choose bomb dismantling?
Probably it gave some adrenaline. It's a job that others shun (its one of the most dangerous job) and one that he can Excel. As I have said, the show doesn't keep talking about duty (we can safely assumed its not sponsored by the Neo-Con). But there he was, performing his duty to his country, and bringing bread to his family the best way he knows how (though agreed that it's a dangerous way).

Why did Sergeant James put himself in extra risks when detonating it would do?
He understood that winning the war, is not only about bombing/killing the Iraqis. Its to show them why the US Army was better. On the IEDs, he saw that the perception of winning convincingly (in the eyes of Iraqis), is to beat them at their own games.

Its well-known that US Army got one of the best technology. Thefore, he was trying to show that US Army have the wits and balls to overcome the sneaky matters that the terrorists were using with the Iraqis. You can call him dumb in choosing this way to signal to the Iraqis. But that is what we call firm conviction and delication.

Why did Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge (partners of Sergeant James), stood by Sergeant James dangerous antics?

They were conservative to risks, but they still protected and followed Sergeant James. This was because, they too shared Sergeant James's belief that they were there to make a difference. Like James, they too knew that firefighting daily to dismantle the bombs would not stop the bombs from coming. Its through their actions that would turn the tide of Iraqis opinions and stop the IEDs from coming.

There was also an aspect of dedication to their fellow soldiers. That partly explained why they always covered James even though they do not fully agreed with him.

The needs to get to the cause of IEDs and their dedication to their fellow soldiers cumulated when James led them to chase after the ""phantom bombers"" when there was an big explosion at the Greenzone, where they are called to investigate.

The fact that they may not have made sound and reasonable judgment did not mean that they are of unsounded mind. It just showed that with prolonged combat fatigue, daily tensions and fog of wars, different decisions may be chosen despite the best of intentions.

CONCLUSION

I hope the above cleared up some questions of the show, as there were many who appeared ""confused"" about the characters. Some were touting Sergeant Jame as an ""adrenaline junkie"" and why some of the actions are taken. Nevertheless, what I have stated above are a fragment of my interpretations for the show. Therefore, they remained just interpretations. Do interpret the show in a more logical and creative ways. Would be nice if you can share that.

I have also noticed reviewer's that questioned the accuracy of the show, in terms of equipment, etc. Let there be a reminder that this is a movie production (albeit Hollywood ones), and its not a documentary. Thus there may be basic gaps on the labeling of equipment or summarization on the chain of command.

Most important for this show, I believe it captured the combat fatigue in war (not just this war), which I have mentioned above. There are almost no political statements or overly colored terms to dignify the war. Basically through their little actions, the soldiers showed their dedication to their country and the ones beside them most of the time, even if they may not agree with some aspects of it.

Therefore, I am giving it a 5 stars because not many modern war movies captured this combat fatigue aspect in a subtle, yet embedded and striking way. (If there are, do share with me).

To conclude, it's a must watch for those who have been in the fields.",1271548800,,4681,4.642079806529625
3861744,3,B00275EGX8,"I do not know a lot about the military, but I do know enough to realize that this movie was greatly dramatized for ""effect"". The flaws were numerous....a three-man unit like the one portrayed would not just go out on its own without backup, which this team did many times. EOD people are not rogues! The search of the dark alleys was just ridiculous and unbelievable...they had night-vision equipment on their helmets but they were shining flashlights down a long dark alley??? And why wouldn't a car engulfed in flames blow up, along with the bombs in its trunk???

It seemed that they never had to answer to any superiors either. No accountability. What the main character, Will, did would never have been tolerated in real life.

I also know, from reading I have done, that disarming a bomb is a last resort....first they would blow it up.

I cannot imagine many EOD people being happy with this movie. The blatant disregard for rules and regulations shown in this movie must really tick them off!

Why wasn't the script more accurate when so much correct info is out there? A modicum of accuracy would not have been difficult to achieve with little effort, it seems. I know this is a movie and is ""made up"" but when a movie claims to depict reality, it should do so. Viewers can only suspend belief so much.

I felt like I was watching a documentary, just one bomb disposal scene after another. No real character development or plot. Just a string of intense situations, some of which are never fully fleshed-out.....like....why was Ralph Fiennes out in the desert with four other men? That was never explained that I could tell. And why would an EOD unit be left out in the desert for so long? Seems to me they would have requested helicopter assistance.

The best things I can say about this movie is that I learned about the various kinds of bombs that are being fashioned in Iraq and that the movie did not try to make a political statement.",1271462400,,1949,4.586206896551724
3861745,1,B00275EGX8,"There is a reason no one cares to watch this movie, even after all that Oscar hype. We are simply tired of war soap operas. We really are. We are tired of nonsense wars, we are tired of spreading the kind of freedom that nobody wants and we are tired of sending our sons and daughters to supposedly defend our country by ways of invading and occupying foreign countries. This while the State propaganda (Minitruth) is busy at home telling the consumers (those would be us) how important it is to blow up and kill people abroad and destroy their lives and while our own country is falling apart, impoverished and exhausted.

Really, you want to see what war looks like from way above? Try the wikileaks site and see how heroic it is to mow down a couple dozen innocent and unarmed people and then call it a victory.

And if you want a sylized rendition of what those freedom-starved natives think of us and what anyone with a working mind and beating heart does when confronted with these situations, go watch Avatar.",1271462400,8,1016,4.516304347826087
3861746,5,B00275EGX8,the movie shows the hardships and dangers of being in Iraq.  plus its action packed with a great story.,1271462400,2,103,4.421052631578948
3861747,4,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker is a very well executed film about an aspect of the war in Iraq we don't think of often: the experiences of the troops assigned to deactivate bombs so that they cannot ever cause damage. The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen; and along with that hand-held camera style of photography I genuinely felt as if I were watching a documentary about real people instead of a film with Hollywood actors in it. In addition, the choreography works wonders for the film; the script was well written and the casting was superbly done.

It isn't long before we meet three soldiers who take on the task of deactivating bombs: Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who gets a drug-like thrill from being the one to go in and deactivate bombs even when he doesn't have to and his two backup men Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and the somewhat troubled Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) who talks to the company shrink but doesn't ever get comfortable with the war the way William James does.

I could say so much about this movie, including what James' ""hurt locker"" represents but then I would be giving too much away. Suffice it to say that the movie is essentially a series of sequences that show the difficulties and the life-or-death stakes the troops face as portrayed by the characters James, Sanborn and Eldridge. There's plenty of action, tension and thriller aspects that add to the overall quality of the film; and the cameos we get from greats like Ralph Fiennes are wonderful. Look also for well done cameos by Evangeline Lilly as Connie James and Guy Pearce as Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. Christopher Sayegh does an excellent job of playing the role of Beckham, a young boy who gets caught up with William James as the film progresses.

If the film has any flaw, I would say that they could have edited down just a bit of the war footage and added just a few minutes more to the scenes in which Williams James is a civilian.

In addition, the DVD comes with a ""behind the scenes"" featurette and an optional running commentary.

The Hurt Locker will forever be one of the great movies about the modern day war in Iraq. I highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject; and people who enjoy thrillers, action movies and even dramas would do well to add this to their collections.",1271376000,3,2354,4.649038461538462
3861748,3,B00275EGX8,"To be perfectly honest, this movie tries a lot of things. It tries to be subversive, it tries to explore the psychology, it tries...alot. and it fails. Constantly.

It is entertaining, yes, but is it right in its entertainment? I don't know what turned me off first. the dialog that seemed to be written by a 17 year old dreaming about how it would be to be in combat, the plot that basically revolves around a team where one's bi-polar, the other keeps up his tough guy persona, and the other is...well...'dedicated'.

The things I like are the stars. David Morse is good(as he always seems to be) as the enthusiastic Colonel, and Ralph Finnes is great as the Private Contractor. Another thing is the actors. The actors help you ignore the whole screenplay, because their just good. Anthony Mackie overacts a little, Jeremy Renner underacts some, and Brian Geraghty acts really well, despite the horrible construction of his character.

I can pick out the scene I like the most, which is the PMC scene involving Guy Finnes. The combat itself is..well..dumb. The sniper scene however, does a great job of dwelling on the time. It's subtle, but you can tell that they've been out there for a long time. The subtle things aren't always that good, but when its done right(i.e. wrist watch scene in The Big Red one) You get the feeling that overall it makes enough sense.

However, the movies script is dribble. Mark Boal's writing deserves to be looked over by more than just himself, that is apparent. The line ""Let's split up"" Almost made me sh** laughing. That line had a Saturday morning stint of Scooby Doo written all over it. I don't like the authenticity of most of the costumes, for in all instances where the American Flag should be, is replaced with the logo of the company who made it. And finally, it's a liberal pipe dream. Now, I'm as middle of the road as you can get, but this, This isn't some sort of magical film that will help you understand the war any better. This film is simply an editorialization by a single man who's experiences are no longer objective, but have been twisted and molded into archetypal ""subversion"" film characters that every big psychological picture has.

I have more respect in the story telling sense for the HBO Mini-series Generation Kill, because rather than just doing everything on the fly like the Hurt Locker, The producers, directors, and the main writers all collaborated with the actual Marines for an elite status of authenticity that feels real. This, This, is more of what everyone would like to think of the War as. As some sort of psychologically comparable Vietnam.

If you can look at this movie, simply for its value as an action film set in Modern Day Iraq, Congrats. However, I would recommend watching the movie ""The Messenger"" and the Mini-Series ""Generation Kill"" over this otherwise.",1271289600,2,2852,4.73991935483871
3861749,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker...where to even start, this film blew me away. literally. I was skeptical upon watching the film based on rumors that I heard involving that the film was political. Having some of my family members in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sensitive to anti-war movies that portray the troops in a bad light. This film was NOT political which was a relief, in fact the film did a damn good job at portraying real life EOD work.

 I really enjoyed this film I couldn't remember a time where I was so immersed in the story and felt that the characters were real and I was right there with them on their tour defusing bombs. The suspense was great I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire film. I think most Americans should view this film, obviously it is not showing the whole picture of the Iraq war but shows a good example of what our boys go through and are faced with on a day to day basis.

The actors did a top notch job and this film deserves every oscar it won. The Blu Ray has an outstanding picture and looks great throughout.

3861752,5,B00275EGX8,"A.O. Scott of The New York Times described Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker,"" winner of the 2009 Best Picture Oscar, as ""visceral visual poetry."" It's all that and a bag of TNT.
 Best Actor nominee Jeremy Renner is the dark in Bigelow's Heart of Darkness. Renner's character is named William James, the same name as the philosopher and founder of American pragmatism. The real-world James wrote ""The Varieties of Religious Experience."" The James of ""The Hurt Locker"" undergoes a religious experience in finding his essential self in more of the same.
 Sandborn (played by Anthony Mackie), a bomb-squad partner of James, is changing tracks at movie's end but one wonders whether the Iraq experience hasn't disconnected his emotional wires, making such a transition impossible. The name Sandborn gives us modest hope that the soldier's essential self has been born through the Middle East experience. Whether that can be grasped and handled by Sandborn's statewide lady is another matter entirely, another movie awaiting Bigelow's production.
 A psychologist colonel with another appropriate name - Cambridge - shows us that Ivy Leaguers have no place in today's war-making other than pushing buttons way away from the combat theater and sharpening pencils Bob McNamara-style. Street fighters like James and Sandborn are the lions of Baghdad and that's probably at the heart of James' peace with war.
 Linking the founder of American pragmatism with Pax Americana is a deft commentary by Bigelow on how far the U.S. has drifted away from prudence.
 Sandborn's courage is a nod from Bigelow to the disproportionate sacrifices of black soldiers since America went to a ""volunteer"" globe-trotting military. The declining economic and social opportunities for most Americans (thanks mostly to the same profligate government that got us into the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan) makes ""volunteering"" a bit different from free will, especially for blacks.
 Speaking of will, Bigelow's Will James is a compelling personification of The Will as described by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Like Schopenhauer's Will, Bigelow's character is stark and unforgettable.",1271030400,2,2158,5.446107784431137

3861761,5,B00275EGX8,"This film avoids the trap of making glib political statements about the Iraq war (it is surely too recent history to know its full significance yet). Instead it focuses on the daily lives of a taught squadron of bomb disposal experts who patrol the dusty Baghdad streets and dry desert scapes searching for and diffusing the ramshackle bombs put in place by insurgents trying to sabbotage the US reconstruction efforts.

The drama weaves closely into the lives of the men, dominated by Sargeant William James, a curiously eager soldier who recklessly seeks out dangerous bomb situations, often failing to heed the warnings of his colleagues.

The plot is taught, not in a synthetic Hollywood way with tension artificially built in leading to some carefully contrived denoument, but in a realistic, frustrating flatlining way. The days tick down to the end of the bomb squad's tour of duty, and the heat, relentless opposition from guerilla insurgents and cruelty (in one memorable scene, insurgents use the corpse of a small boy to conceal explosives) all take their toll on the men. They quarrel, gossip, banter and fight. The narrative in a way flatlines, replicating the true situation in Iraq where it was (still is) very difficult to tell what sort of impact and progress is being made.

But the comradeship between the men is real, and this is developed in the film through touching scenes, such as James supplying an exhausted colleague (and rival) with water after he has been staring out at insurgents in the desert heat for hours.

Realistic cinematography, with a good mix of panoramic shots and action close ups. It is a skilled, intelligent and moving film. well deserving of its accolades. The final twist is not gimmicky, but rather reflects the addictive effect that war has on some people, providing a tension and purpose that far suppasses anything in ordinary suburban life.

3861776,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker is a movie about a bomb disposal team working in Baghdad during the Iraq War. It has just won six academy awards, including Best Picture.

The main character, William James, doesn't say much, isn't particularly tall or strong, and works in bomb disposal. I didn't expect him to be the most natural war movie lead. I was very wrong.

In his first mission, James comes to life. His bomb disposal team is called out to a site in residential Baghdad. A length of wire has been found leading into a pile of rubble. Explosives are suspected, but James refuses to use a disposal robot. He begins to walk towards the suspected bomb. A sniper could appear in any passing window. James enters the `kill zone,' the area within which an explosion would mean death. He walks slowly, glancing at a group of soldiers on his left. Suddenly a small car comes racing through, past the troops. James pulls a pistol and turns, pointing it directly at the driver, the driver stops. James steps closer, gun still pointed. Is it an insurgent? The car won't leave. James is standing next to a bomb with his gun raised. He walks to the side of the vehicle, places his gun against the temple of the frightened driver. The car withdraws. James smiles, makes a joke, and begins to dig for the bomb. He finds one, and disarms it. Then he finds a cable. Then he finds six more bombs. A man is running through a nearby window. Does he have a mobile phone? Will he trigger one of the bombs? James is still smiling with an eery calm.

`Do you realise that everytime you suit up, everytime we go out, its life or death. You roll the dice, and you deal with it. You recognise that don't you.'

`Yeah. Yeah I do. But I don't know why. I... I don't really think about that.'

He seems entirely without fear, taking needless risks, ignoring senior officers, laughing off bodies. He keeps a small crate in his room of bomb triggers that nearly killed him. James becomes a fascinating character because he truly has no fear or respect for death.

He is enigma of something between hero and serial killer, a mystery to even himself.

On one occasion he turns to a partner he has had for a matter of weeks and asks,
`Do you know why I am why I am?'

Hurt Locker is a highly unbelievable movie at times, and all things considered, perhaps not the greatest representation of the mechanics of war. But it is still in my opinion an excellent film because William James is a fascinating, deeply human main character.",1270166400,,2485,4.470198675496689
3861777,3,B00275EGX8,"In addition to NOT being the ""best movie of the year"", it's also not the ""best war movie ever"", as a critic stated.

It's probably the best Iraq movie so far, but that's not really saying a lot, since most of them have been nothing but thinly-veiled anti-war, anti-Bush, anti-American propaganda.  If you want to see a superior Middle East war/conflict movie, check out The Kingdom.

Watching The Hurt Locker, it is way too easy to sense all the overly-exaggerated parts.  They come about often.

There are some parts where you feel like they are telling little snippets of stories told to the filmmakers by real soldiers, such as the strange ""fight"" in which two characters take turns punching each other in the gut, like a game.  But the way those snippets are thrown in there seem random and out of character for the lead characters.

I did like the way the movie took its time in certain parts, in order to build up some tension.  But I have no idea how the director won ""Best Director"", because a truly great director would have the audience cringing and squirming.  The result in this movie was mild tension, followed by more unbelievable actions on the soldiers' part.  You tell me, what soldier would sneak out after dark, running around alone without a weapon in some Iraq town?  It's loopy, and even the people he stumbles across are totally unrealistic.

Actually, I do know why this director won for ""Best Director"" and the movie won for ""Best Movie"".  Because Hollywood is so out of touch.  Seeing as the actors make up most of the Academy voting population, it makes sense (absurdly) that this movie would win.",1270166400,,1624,4.672535211267606

This started in the opening scene, where the sophisticated robot is pulling a flimsy handcart that falls apart at the first obstacle. The worst scene has to be the sniper scenario, where an incompetent British SAS team is wiped out by Iraqi snipers from 800 yards using AK47's and the heroic Americans promptly show that they are also trained snipers, capable of hitting a moving target at nearly 1000 yards range! The movie can only go downhill from here and of course it does, with a ridiculous scene where our hero goes out after dark in combat fatigues on a futile mission to try and find ""Beckham's"" killers and then calmly walks through Baghdad without getting a scratch. Then we have the strange episode of the reluctant suicide bomber, who the insurgents have encased in explosives and put in the middle of the town square. When Rambo arrives, the first thing he sees is a watch hanging from the bomb that says, ""I'm going off in 2 minutes, please keep away""!

When the bomb tech holds his radio up to the unfortunate Iraqi forced to wear a suicide vest, I cringed.  You don't do that.  No cell phones or radios.  Ever.  ""You're 10-2.""  Ka Boom.

But it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.  And any movie that tries to show what our soldiers are going through is always a good thing (unless, of course, it's JARHEAD, which I didn't see but read the blistering review in the New York Post by a furious Iraqi Veteran).

It takes a while but the characters start to emerge and you like the three guys the film focuses on.  Especially the ""wild man"" who discovers the one thing in life he loves.  Excellent actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce make appearances.  And some sequences are very well edited for maximum suspense.

Another thing that hurt this film: Hollywood politics.  Kathryn Bigelow, the director, beat her ex-husband James Cameron (AVATAR) for Best Director. I knew that was going to happen.  In a business where powerful men (like Cameron) who dump wives for younger women (like Cameron) deserve to have their comeuppance, Hollywood-style.  That dynamic, I believe, diminishes Bigelow's win.  Sadly.  Yes, it was about time a woman was honored for Best Director, but Hollywood's zeal for drama and their taste for revenge sullied her win.  It will always be there.
I'm not saying she didn't deserve it...I just wish it had been under different circumstances.

3861797,3,B00275EGX8,"""Hurt Locker"" just has far too many flaws to have deserved Best Picture.

I walked into the theater knowing that many with military experience had been critical of its depiction of unit tactics and deployment.  Having served in the Army myself (pre-Iraq war) I was actually fine with that part of the movie as there's an obvious logistical reason for the way it was filmed - cost and the hassle of introducing more characters than were wanted/necessary to the plot.  If the director (Bigelow) had shown an entire platoon or more accompanying the bomb disposal unit she would have also had to introduce some of them as secondary characters.  So I gave a free pass on that count.  However, I take other vets word on the use of the suit and how the bombs were diffused.  Wasn't realistic.

The combat scene in the desert is also completely wrong.  The insurgents take out soldiers at almost 900 meters with single shots using AKs!  Not just no way, but no freakin' way.  US soldiers are trained to take out targets with M-16s at 300 meters and not everyone can do it.  Hitting someone at almost three times that distance in one shot  . . . NO.  Not with an M-16 and not with an AK. Meanwhile, the US soldier firing with a high caliber rifle - something actually intended for sniping - has to take several shots before he can finally hit the insurgents.  That part is possibly correct, especially if the soldier firing isn't a trained sniper.

Bigelow also forces her characters to do things because her plot demands it, not because it makes sense.  This is just bad film making to make such an error.  Example: The main character tells his wife a story near the end of the movie that would have caused any normal person, especially a mother, to react with some emotion and empathy.  But instead Bigelow forces that character to act cold and distant . . . which helps set up the next action by the male lead.

How did this movie win Best Picture?  ""Avatar"" certainly didn't deserve to win either.  It's ""Dances With Wolves"" via CGI. 2009 must have been one bad year for quality movies . . . or, more likely, Hollywood was unwilling to buck their ""need"" to either be popular (""Avatar"") or political (""Hurt Locker"") and just go with a solid film like ""Up,"" ""Precious"" or ""Up in the Air.""",1269475200,,2281,4.528117359413203

3861804,3,B00275EGX8,"With competition like the outstanding `District 9' and the visually stunning `Avatar' released in 3-D in 2009 (not to mention `The Blind Side'), it's difficult to understand how Kathryn Bigelow's film could justifiably be considered the best film of the year by the Academy. Life is full of surprises.

The Hurt Locker of the title refers to a box of bomb parts, fuses and detonators which Sgt William James, the main character at the centre of the story, keeps under his bed. These are souvenirs of all the bombs that almost killed him, but didn't. The film has a few plus points: building of tension, the realism of the environment (filmed in Jordan with Iraqi ex-pats playing Iraqi citizens and insurgents) and conveying the lethality and horror of the work the EOD team do. However there are too many shortcomings for this to be a great film, and classic status is an unlikely future.

First of all, there is no real plot or development of character and the story goes nowhere. From a straw poll of people I know who have also seen the film the audience does not easily warm to the three main players and frankly doesn't much care what happens to them. I certainly didn't. The characters are only one step beyond cardboard cut-outs.

Secondly, bomb disposal teams in the real world do not risk their own lives and those of colleagues recklessly by defusing lethal ordnance by hand when small robot vehicles are perfectly capable of doing the job, as shown in the first scene - not more than once anyway, without facing serious disciplinary action. The `maverick hero challenging staid authority' theme, a favorite staple of Hollywood, is pushed to incredulity here.

Thirdly, even a viewer who has not served in the military can see many of the anomalies which make the whole film look sloppy. Three guys in an EOD team repeatedly alone in a potentially hostile environment, with no supporting infantry or cover? Come on. The new pixelated uniforms are anachronistic for 2004, when the film is supposed to be set. When the main protagonist James - a serving US Army sergeant no less - hijacks a shady DVD-seller's car by holding a gun to the guy's head and orders him to drive to the house of a murdered young boy's family, well, at that point I'm afraid suspension of disbelief went too far. The whole scene was utterly preposterous, pure fantasy, unreal: the very worst of Hollywood is no less believable than this. The three's subsequent race through dark alleyways in Baghdad at night with flashlights on their helmets searching for suspected bombers (LIGHTED FLASHLIGHTS ON THEIR HELMETS FOR GOD'S SAKE!) well, Kathryn, you lost my interest. That's just plain stupid. Then the leg-wounded Sergeant Eldridge is evacuated in an ancient Vietnam-era Huey helicopter. In 2004. Yeah.

Why not get these details right? It's not difficult. Because these numerous gaffes are not compensated by plot, storyline, script or anything else to hold the viewer's interest, boredom and impatience set in so that the anomalies come into sharper focus.

Considering the relatively modest (by current Hollywood standards) budget the film does look gritty and real. It actually looks like Iraq. Competent direction and editing ensure the film is a white-knuckle rollercoaster of tension for much of the running time but because of insufficient episodes of light and shade the tension paradoxically starts to become monotonous and loses its edge. The hand-held camera work, used so effectively by Spielberg in `Saving Private Ryan' to convey chaotic, combat-urgent realism, is appropriate but hardly original and has been done better by others. And who were those Brits disguised as Arabs in the middle of the desert supposed to be? Mercenaries? Special Forces? We're not told. They seem to be featured to remind American viewers there are other foreign forces in Iraq and so it's confusing, and this particular crew's main function seems to be to get shot dead in the fire-fight to add to the drama.

On the positive side, the film is refreshingly apolitical and does not (unlike `Avatar') preach to the audience and tell them what they should think. The political views of the writer/director are not put into the mouths of the actors, and the viewer is left to make up his own mind what he thinks about the wisdom or folly of the conflict in a broader geopolitical context.

The short scene near the end of the film with James back home with his wife and young son, engaged with the banalities of everyday suburban life like cleaning leaves from rain drains and shopping at the supermarket, is understated and well, OK. However, we have no feeling of the relationship between James and his wife or why he should choose to leave his infant son and return to his lethal work in Iraq except the premise that `war/life-threatening danger is a drug, an addiction.' Yeah, profound. This could have been a rich and powerful dramatic scene if handled well but the opportunity is lost and the theme is not convincingly explored.

Dare one suspect the Academy's best film and best direction awards decisions were guided by sensitivity to the essentially worthy subject matter of `The Hurt Locker' and the feeling that to pass over this film might be seen as an insult to the serving soldiers in Iraq? That to award the Oscar to Bigelow's ex-husband's `Avatar' might be seen as confirmation that Hollywood is just about escapist entertainment spectaculars and simplistic, PC-driven new-age platitudes? Maybe the Oscar was awarded to Bigelow on gender grounds to have a female director win for the first time, even though the film itself barely deserves it. We can only speculate. Not a good decision on artistic grounds because although `The Hurt Locker' is not an outright bad film, it's not very good either. A better film with this subject matter might have been made. The other major war-themed movie of 2009, `Inglorious Basterds' although containing all Tarantino's violent fantasy-comic-book excesses, nevertheless has a tight and clever plot, strongly defined characters, superlative script, wicked black humor and an outstanding denoument which puts it way ahead of Bigelow's thinner offering as a satisfying viewing experience.",1269216000,,6216,4.980732177263969

Imagine my shock and dismay when the reporters were right in their prediction! My thought then was ""WHAT A TRAVESTY!!! In no way did the Hurt Locker come close to being the best picture. My own feeling is that the voters of Academy members voted to spite Mr. Cameron who stood to make history by directing the two all time grossing movies - the Titanic and Avatar. They knew that Mr. Cameron was about to achieve a feat of titanic proportions and set out to deny him that. The Hurt Locker is as undeserving of the best picture honor as President Obama was of the Nobel Peace Prize. Is it merely a coincidence that, like Obama, the Hurt Locker promotes and glorifies militarism. If the members were looking to make history by naming the first woman to win the Best Director and Best Picture categories, they chose the wrong movie to make that history.

The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) and written by Mark Boal. It stars Jeremy Renner as Sgt. William James, a team leader for a bomb squad stationed in Iraq. The other members of his team are Sgt. JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie and Spc. Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty. The story takes place over a 39 day period where Bravo company is waiting to be relieved so they can go home.

This movie's directing is fantastic. The terrifying suspense that builds over time with each bomb wondering if it will be someone's last bomb to attempt to defuse. The terrain, heat, and dust were so well captured, they were making ME thirsty! Emotionally, the life and death situation these soldiers were put into everyday really messed with their psyche and perception of their mortality. James is a wildman, fearless to just jump into any situation recklessly, Sanborn tries his best to keep everyone safe but is afraid of commitment and getting too close to a woman back home, and Eldridge is getting therapy from a Colonel because he so intensely feels the strain that every day he might die.

The actors very clearly defined their characters. All were well developed with layers in their performance, not all bravado or all fear. They just worked amazingly well as a unit. I have a hard time even singling out any of the three because as soon as I attribute something to one in my head, I remember something else one of the others did. Let's just say they handled the heavy burden of this movie incredibly well and I hope to see more from them in the future.

One last note, turns out James' wife back home is Evangeline Lilly, Kate from LOST. My husband and James have something in common, if that was what they had to come home to, they'd be bored too, haha. We're not Kate or Jack fans. We are fans of Locke and Ben and Hurley!",1269129600,,1933,4.498575498575499

They did borrow a tad from ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by sending the dissenbomer home to an environment that did not understand him.

3861811,5,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker,"" this year's Oscar winner, is a very intense Iraq combat film in which Staff Sergeant James (played by Jeremy Renner) is extremely fearless and very adept at defusing planted bombs, but very inept at protecting from harm the men he works closest with. He's a risk-taker, a reckless soldier, who is baffled by civilian life but thrives on the danger of his mission. As a civilian, a fish out of water, an endless line of cereal products in a supermarket flummoxes him, and is a mine field, but yet in a real mine field, he thrives on danger and facing death every day.
 He's a complex person who walks fearlessly into an area planted with bombs, but he's not a person to be envied, admired or emulated.
 Ironically he has probably saved hundreds of lives by his bomb defusing skills, but saving lives isn't really what motivates him. It is his own personal adrenaline rush, his egotism, and self-absorption which keeps him going. He's not a war lover per se who goes out and slaughters the enemy indiscriminately, but he has the perfect job for his personality because it gives him a chance to play a kind of Russian roulette with his life.
The movie shows him in off-duty situations. He's a heavy drinker, heavy-smoker, and a person who enjoys violent interplay with his mates. They don't like him; they hate him and fear him even though at times he briefly shows compassion towards them. He's a man's man in his own mind, a cowboy, but basically a loner.
Though filmed in Jordan, you get the feeling that you really are in the mean streets of Iraq. The movie won't bore you; it's violent and bloody, but it's the character of Sergeant James that will stay with you. Is he the kind of man who is going to save the world, or is he part of the problem?",1268870400,3,1768,4.5046728971962615
3861812,5,B00275EGX8,"We made war because we were motivated by fear, by the propaganda of the demagogues under the guise of just cause, and not only of just cause but of necessity. They even had me convinced by their mass media barrage of patriotism, their lip-service to Judeo-Christian ideals, and their creation of an environment of fear.

Once into the war, even though our nation was beginning to slowly come to its senses, there was no getting out. We were locked in. We are still locked in.

In the movie, the civilian who appears with the bomb locked around him is used not just as a thriller plot device. It is a metaphor for our own participation in this war. We were locked in, and there are so many locks to break. The interpreters and the man himself cry out that he is, like us, a good man, forced into the situation he is in. That he just wants to return to his family.

The gun-ho, ego-driven, war-addicted Will James (named after the cowboy author but also representative of the Will Force--in a sort of Nietzsche/Schopenhauer sense) wants vengeance for the death of the pirate-video-selling kid, which never happened except in his imagination, and Will conscripts the rest of his team to go after the bad guys on his own cuff. The professional soldier and the everyman counting the days until he can get out of Iraq reluctantly follow, and the everyman is badly wounded, crippled, needlessly.

It turns out that Will had misidentified the kid's body and took them in there, putting their lives at risk as well as creating terror among peaceful native civilians, for nothing.

This incident is a small parable for the whole war.

While we might blame Bush & Co. for this specific war, we could not blame them for the constancy of war in the human condition. On that grander scale, this movie asks the question: Who locks these locks on the everyman civilian, who has so many locks on him that--try as we might to free him--it remains hopeless?

The answer is that the Will Force is the war locker, the hurt locker.  I'm glad that they did not place the duality of politics into the movie, for the movie is not about politics--it is about the human condition.",1268784000,,2153,4.588541666666667

3861818,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker quite simply is one of the finest cinematic achievements in recent years. It recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director, along with four others, and deservingly so. It's made with a precision and craft that is unique and outstanding, and it's also very intense and entertaining.

The three main leads played by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty are all convincing as members of a bomb disposal team at the height of violence in the Iraq war. They move from mission to mission in dangerous situations where their individual personalities and the way they deal with the trauma of war come out. Renner is particularly impressive as a bomb defusing expert who has a certain recklessness and even addiction to what he does.

The directorial achievement by Kathryn Bigelow and the script by Mark Boal are no less impressive. There has been controversy over the realism in aspects of this movie, but to me it seemed completely believable. The suspenseful action scenes are done with complete clarity giving an amazing scope which heightens the dramatic effect. The stuff in between these sequences though are just as important, giving effective character development, like when Renner's character befriends an Iraqi boy who sells DVDs.

The film is must see. I've seen it twice and will definitely watch it many more times.  It works great as a drama, as a thriller, and as an action movie. Some have asked what the movie is really about. Well in a nutshell it's about the brutal reality of modern day war, and the truth that war can be a drug. It's not political and doesn't try to force some phony higher message. It's three men doing their job, and it's brilliant.",1268611200,4,1707,4.835616438356165

WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE TO ALL THE OTHER GREAT MOVIES IT IS SUPPOSEDLY BETTER THAN!!!!!! WHAT FILM WHERE THESE PEOPLE WATCHING? There were at least 5 other films that were far better this year alone. I am not an Avatar fanatic by a far stretch, but it was way above and beyond anything the Hurt Locker could provide in entertainment. Are they to tell me that the Hurt Locker is a better film than ""UP"", even ""Inglorious Basterds"" was a much better film! And how's about ""Up in the AIr""? There is no there in this film, there is not one interesting character.
There is no tension in those extremely unrealistic situations they unrealistically ""stumble"" into. How did they get there? What was the motivation, what was the story line? Who in Iraq goes out of the green zone in just one vehicle and just a couple of support soldiers, with no one from higher up having any say? One unreality after another in this film.

As far as a war film is concerned, it is another slap in the face to all those other great war films that this film can't hold a candle to, films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, The Big Red One, and how many other great war films out there that are far better than The Hurt Locker. Any single episode of the ""Band of Brothers"" is far superior to the Hurt Locker.
I always had reservations about the selection committees, usually I just went with the flow, but the fix was in on this one! It did not deserve one single Oscar. I had to watch it three times to see if I was missing anything that others were seeing, all I have to say to anyone that thinks this film was good in any way, needs to remind themselves of the great films that preceded this one and truly ask themselves if it really deserves to be anywhere near the same class in respect to any of the others.

3861825,3,B00275EGX8,"I've grown accustomed to being disappointed in the wins for best picture at the Oscars over the last few years. It seems those who make the decisions are so dead set on being taken seriously as artists that they fail to choose films that are popular as well as artistic, going for the dramatic punch that they feel shows how serious they are. When you discount one aspect of a film in an attempt to look at another, you lose perspective of the whole meaning of the award. I always looked at the Oscar as rewarding the best and the brightest. It seems that stopped a few years back and continues to do so this year with THE HURT LOCKER.

Don't get me wrong. The movie is a good look at the world our military goes through on a day to day basis in war torn countries, this one being Iraq. But with all the movies I saw this past year, this was not the one that I though came near being the best. And Kathryn Bigelow has long deserved notice in Hollywood. Her work in the past was ignored and the making of this film wasn't done by a major Hollywood studio. That shows how much they truly respect her. The nicest thing about it is that she will now have enough clout to get more of her movies off the ground.

So the story. The film opens with a group of soldiers in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their job is to dismantle, disarm or explode any bombs that are found in the area they are stationed in. The weapons of choice they most often come into contact with are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and they have one here. As they attempt to prevent the bomb from exploding, an insurgent with a cell phone explodes it, killing the group's leader.

The film moves on to the new leader of the group, the new bomb expert Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), one of the remaining soldiers, welcomes James to Camp Victory which was Camp Liberty but they decided this sounded better. In his quarters, James has taken off the boards covering the windows to let light in. When Sanborn points out they were installed to keep mortar fire from coming through, James points out that the mortars could easily come in through the roof and he prefers the light. As the film progresses, this becomes a telling moment into the psychological state of mind of James.

With only 38 days left of service, the team is sent out to do their job in the city. Completing the group is Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), also witness to the first death. As they arrive at locations throughout the film to disarm bombs, the cautious Sanborn and Eldridge are perplexed by James willingness to confront danger head on. His unwillingness to follow protocol or to listen to Sanborn leads to a confrontation as well as several hair raising sequences where they set out to save lives by taking the bombs out.

The differences in these men are what make up the meat of the film. Sanborn wants to follow orders and wants to survive, yet he doesn't see that in James. Eldridge is the most apparently mentally disturbed of the trio, talking with the camp psychiatrist as he deals with the death that surrounds him. But it is James that is the most frightening of the group, living without fear of death, taking apart bombs as if there's nothing more thrilling to do, trying to find solutions to each one he comes across.

James character is so in tune with his love of danger that he keeps a box of bomb parts and detonators under his bed. It is James' story that is the focus of the film. He has become so involved in his position that he seeks out danger, that adrenaline rush that comes with it. The problem is that at the same time he puts his men in harm's way as well.

While the trio evolve into a sense of camaraderie, they also begin to come apart in thanks to James' need for the rush. With days counting down as the story moves forward, the tensions mount.

Sound like a good movie? Well, it sort of is. But at the same time the tenseness of the situations these men find themselves in is played out in a semi-real time mode. The viewer is required to sit and painstakingly wait as the clock ticks by while bombs are taken out.

While each actor and character are played well, the main focus on James by Renner is exceptional. A young actor just getting notice, Renner portrays a complex series of emotions in James, from the thrill junkie to the tender hearted man who weeps at the sight of a young boy he got to know who appears to be murdered with a bomb planted inside of him later on.

The film confronts some tough issues concerning war and the world we face in Iraq. But the best thing that it does is not take a major stand on the issues. It doesn't go right or left politically but tells the tale of the men in uniform straight on.

So why didn't I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture? Because it was long and drawn out, it moved at a snails pace and it didn't entertain me. Yes, it was well made (with the exception of the hand held jostling camera that seems to have become a favorite lately) and yes it told a compelling story. But I never felt involved, never invested in the characters enough to get into the film.

I know, many people will take exception with my views as to this not being deserving of the award. But when did we decide that gritty, hard tempered films were the only ones deserving? When did films that contained hope become the black sheep? When did movies that made us laugh or sing suddenly become unworthy?

I am a firm believer that most people go to movies to escape the world they live in, to get away from the moments of pain, poverty, anger and down right meanness they are exposed to daily. Those are the movies that inspire and give hope. They deserve to be rewarded. And yet Hollywood continues to choose message films instead. It is because of this that I can't say this movie deserves the award.

As for a viewing, I'm not even sure I can recommend it for that either. It is tedious at worst and contains fine performances at best. The only way to choose viewing this is making the choice on your own, knowing inside what it is you expect from a film, what you want from one. I know I couldn't sit through this one again, not due to the content but due to the slowness of it.",1268524800,2,6262,4.368556701030927

A ""feel-good"" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.

I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be ""significant"" and ""modern"" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglourious-Basterds/dp/B002T9H2L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglourious Basterds</a>?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9/dp/B002SJIO5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9</a>?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-in-the-Air/dp/B00337KMAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up in the Air</a>? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later/dp/B000VDDWEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later</a>) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.

From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is ""the film to watch"" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or -- one that didn't even get mentioned --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moon/dp/B002T9H2ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moon</a>.

Let's hit on the Best Director item...

No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.

I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.

I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.

For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009. Please.",1268352000,4,4321,5.710730948678072
3861837,3,B00275EGX8,"After reading some of the other reviews, I thought I'd write one of my own.

If you haven't seen this film and you're looking for an action film that isn't too deep and doesn't force-feed you a political message, then this film will fit that requirement.  If you're expecting an accurate portrayal of an EOD specialist in Iraq or what life is like for the military on a day-to-day basis, I don't think this is it.

I know the movie has been touted by critics to be very realistic.  There are many factors that may have contributed to this claim of realism.  The movie does omit many of the long-time Hollywood standards, like trampoline jumps and spittoon-sounding ricochets.  The absence of these acrobatics and unrealistic sounds might make it seem more realistic to viewers.

The way injuries were portrayed was more realistic than you might find in other action/war movies of the same genre.  Unlike Rambo films where all injuries are superficial, when someone was wounded in this film, that person didn't get up in the next scene and act like the life-threatening wounds he'd received minutes ago were mere scratches.  Someone with a leg injury actually had to go to the hospital and couldn't use that leg to walk, run, or deliver a roundhouse kick to a bad guy and a guy standing next to an exploding device was actually killed, not just flipped into the air.

The movie also avoids making a definitive political message.  Even if in reality, soldiers often vocalize their political views, the makers of the film didn't use the characters as a mouthpiece for their own political views, which I think is a positive point.  I think the film neither glamorizes war or makes soldiers look like bloodthirsty murderers.

I think it's also fair to say that the movie pointed out that being in EOD requires a special kind of personality; someone who goes toward the source of imminent danger while everyone else is headed the other way.  At the same time, the techniques the protagonist (SFC James) used to dismantle explosives was pure Hollywood.  The movie didn't have the trope-laden red wire/blue wire dilemma or the over-used plot device where a bomb's timer stops with one second to spare, but I don't think any current or former EOD specialist would say that the techniques shown in the film are even remotely accurate, especially carelessly pulling on wires with enough force to uproot a series of artillery rounds.

The dialogue and character development were both fairly good.  The movie avoided the cheap one-liners so popular these days and also didn't stereotype any of the characters.  Each person had his own qualities and set of problems, some of which get resolved and others that don't.  The characters' interactions with one another were believable.  I did have a hard time relating to the protagonist, though, mostly because of his inability to recognize what was wrong with disregarding the safety of the men in his unit while he was playing cowboy and doing his own thing.  Later in the film, it's revealed that he had some compassion for the men he works with, but this doesn't make up for the times he needlessly endangers them, even if it does seem to work out for him (more or less).

With all that being said, I don't think it was a horrible film if taken at face value, but I also don't think it is an eye-opening new look at the war in Iraq or a snapshot of the day-to-day dangers faced in combat.",1268352000,3,3424,4.719327731092437

I have a friend that is EOD, and he and I watched this movie, he said that while this movie is a bit of a far cry as to how they really operate, it's still a really entertaining movie. He said military guys know, you can't exactly go rogue too many times, because the hammer of authority will come down upon you.

There was a blurb on the screen in the beginning to apparently explain ""War is a Drug"" or some such nonsense, then to connect the dots to that statement, near the end of the film there is a very small scene of Jeremy Renner's main character at home bored out his mind (he had apparently been forced to watch the days rushes for ""The Hurt Locker"").

about this movie, which, until then, was basically unheard of by anyone
but the most devoted film buffs and Hollywood insiders.
In fact, it had already been released to DVD by then without too much fanfare.
Curious as to why this film had gotten past my radar and was
obviously getting all these raves, rants, and hype from the Hollywood machine,
yet nobody had really seen it, I went out and rented it from a local redbox vender.
I watched it and was immediately taken with Jeremy Renner's intense and renegade performance,
but outside of that, I also noticed that the film really had nothing to propel it beyond that!
The supporting cast, though some of them had their moments,
were basically forgettable in most of what they did.
The plot was kind of loose and non-exsistent in some places.
It also seemed kind of choppy to me...like a lot of ideas and scenarios
which were explored, some more to fruition than others, and kind of
spliced together around the only REAL SOLID performance, which was Renner's.

While successful in its depiction of the old adage that War is Hell, this movie really doesn't show us anything new that we haven't seen before in war movies equally well-done if not better done than this one.  It is a well-enough made pic about the hell that is (or was) Iraq since the movie is set in 2004.  But that is all it is.  There are some well-done action sequences and there is a requisite amount of tension since we are primarily dealing with a bomb squad...but there is no script worth mentioning, no great acting worth waxing ecstatic about, no profoundities to ponder, no characters we ever truly come to like and care about.  It is very akin in parts to ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Black Hawk Down.""  It owes alot to ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalpyse Now.""  (The movies just mentioned, by the way, are all far better than this one.)  It's main character is a descendant of Steve McQueen's war-loving, isolated characters in ""The War Lover"" and ""Hell is for Heroes.""  Why it won Best Picture is not because it is a great movie, but because it was the PC thing to do to help boost morale amongst today's military - and to break the male-dominated Best Director award by giving it to the Academy's first-ever female director.  And, as mentioned by many others on Amazon, there are several unrealistic sequences and a cliched death that I could see coming an hour before.  Now, I have not seen ""Avatar"" and have no desire to see so - the blue aliens just look very odious and unrealistic to me and James Cameron writes awful scripts.  (""Titanic"" was a silly little love story riddled with lousy dialogue and a soap opera plot.) Having said that, maybe ""Avatar"" did get the shaft on Oscar night. If ""The Hurt Locker"" is what the Academy deems a ""Best Picture"" then, well, it is no wonder they forgot to include not just Farrah Fawcet in the sequence remembering those persons affiliated with the film industry who have passed over - but also Edward Woodward and Patrick McGoohan were ignored.

I realize some soldiers can get a little graphic with their language at times, but it really wasn't needed in the film--especially with the frequency they used the F word in particular.

3861849,5,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker"" has just won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture and it truly earns it. Here is a war movie that takes no real position on war, and especially no position on the Iraq War, and simply shows the mental and physical brutality and beauty of conflict.

You know the story by now. It centers around a bomb disposal and disarmament team in Iraq who throw themselves into harm's way on a regular basis in order to make life safer for their fellow soldiers and civilians. The team receives a new member, played by the fantastic Jeremy Renner, who is something of a wild card. Soon he and everyone else are pulled into his own personal brand of insanity as he comes to realize that without the war, he's nothing.

It's a simple concept and wonderfully executed by Kathryn Bigelow and her team. It was filmed on location in the Middle East and you really get a sense of what life is like that part of the world for our soldiers and the civilians who live there. You bear witness to some of the day-to-day tragedies that happen (admittedly not as much now as they did in 2004 when this movie is apparently set), like a man forced into a suicide bombing. It's a harrowing look at an unpleasant reality.

I mention in the title of the review that it's an action movie where you dread the action. This is entirely true. You really start to become quite fond of the three bomb techs, and when the bullets start flying and things start exploding, you worry about them. You want nothing more than for them to go back to their base, nice and safe, and not venture out into the dangerous world. It's something I've not come across in an action-type film, and I'm glad to see it here.

Was this actually the best movie of 2009? Well, yes. It won't have the long-term influence of ""Avatar"", but it is overall better than that film. I'm glad it won and I'm glad I've seen it.",1268092800,2,1876,4.382183908045977

3861852,5,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker"" currently stands as the most critically acclaimed film of 2009 and after seeing it just this week I'm inclined to agree this acclamation wholeheartedly. This really is a work of art from start to finish and has now been moved to the top of my list of movies to own and cherish forever. Since its release it has won numerous awards and has 9 Academy award nominations which they will undoubtedly win come the ceremony in March. The cast comprises of unknowns, but are ones with very familiar faces as, after doing a bit of research, a few of the actors have had very minor roles in other TV shows and movies so if this will be their leap to the big time, then it's well deserved.

During the early stages of the Iraq war in 2004, this film follows a 3 member EOD (Explosives Ordinance Disposal) unit as they go about their missions in providing cover for one member, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) while he disarms IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices. James' behaviour in rushing into the blast radius without sending in the bomb disposal robot first leads to him being labelled reckless by his fellow officers, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This image of a reckless officer has a negative effect on the team dynamic and as the film progresses you become more and more aware of the individual reasons why each character is the way he is.

This film doesn't really follow a plot in the sense of that the team must solve some form of deep seeded puzzle, or there is a mastermind behind the bombs that this unit specifically dealt with. It simply follows a trio of officers as they do the same job which is being done for real in Iraq and touches upon how those officers deal with the situations in which they find themselves. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, wanted the film to immerse the viewer into something that was ""Raw, immediate and Visceral"". That it certainly achieved perfectly as although some of the scenes may seem slow, they're slow for a purpose. It wants you to be aware that anything can change at any time and although there may be a slight stint of calm and silence, that can change in an instant and it was brilliantly done.

Although some of the actors may be better known than others, I'm happy in a way that it isn't a cast of megastars playing these roles. In a movie like this, if you had a cast that consisted of the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon or Tom Cruise, for example, then the film simply wouldn't have the same impact. You would watch it for another purpose, rather than simply watching it for the story and that is why there appears to be this revolution of sorts with more and more of the most critically successful films containing unknown or little known actors rather than the big names. The film was shot in both Jordan and Kuwait and had a really authentic look and feel to it and the film is overall well deserving of any praise which it receives.

However, there is one gripe I have about this film and it is one which was touched upon by other reviewers who unfairly gave it 1 star just due to this point alone. The way in which British servicemen were portrayed around the middle of the film was terribly offensive and overly typical to the point I had expected it to happen at some point during the film before even switching it on. There have been mountains of films that have done this and this will not be the last to make such a mistake, on the other side of the argument though, you would almost expect an English film to do the same thing to the Americans regardless of how serious the film is supposed to be. Although I did find this slightly offensive, I didn't let this damage my view of the film as a whole which I still support as being sublime.

Shockingly brilliant and although it let me down in one particular scene, the film overall was superb. On Blu-Ray this film is especially done justice as the detail and resolution just makes it visually superb in its own right. Buy it, rent it or watch it at a friend's house. This is definitely a film to see.",1268092800,,4103,4.472630173564753
3861853,4,B00275EGX8,"Nah, the movie itself isn't politically correct, but its Oscar award as Best Picture of the year is an example of PC at its finest.  ""Hurt Locker"" was good entertainment--see my four star rating--but not top of the heap Oscar material.  It won because it was time for a woman director to win, in the Academy Award community's eyes.

It also won because it dealt with the Iraq war without being political or biased against the war, which is the kiss of death even in the Oscar community.

The movie itself deals with a team of bomb defusers led by the Jeremy Renner character, James, who's a little crazy.  He's gutsy and takes chances.  The incidents in which he disables bombs are tense and sweaty (even for those in the audience), but the most effective scene I thought was James's confronting a taxi driver who drove through the cordon around an IED right up to him.  Nice use of suspense and tension.

James is brave to the point of foolhardiness, which stresses (and eventually damages) his team.  But he loves war--it really is a drug to him, and can't see himself doing anything else.  No moping around wondering what's going on on the home front for him.

The movie was well worth the time and money to watch, as long as you heeded the R rating warning--one cadaver scene was particularly disturbing--but picture of the year?  I don't think so, unless the other candidates were a little weak.",1268092800,2,1400,4.600806451612903
3861854,3,B00275EGX8,"Hurt Locker isn't a bad film in itself and the story of the main character is interesting, as is the menace of the bombs and the faceless duel that seems to ensue. I think that part of the film is clever.

The sets are fantastic and have a realistic gritty feel. Now I have not been to Iraq/Afghanistan myself but in my circle of friends there are two that have been there for tour of duty and keeping this in mind I don't think he story is far fetched as some here say. Things do and will happen in war.

The thing just is that Hurt Locker is simply o.k. and nothing more. It is certainly no Oscar material (nor would Avatar or District 9 rank anywhere close) and stands badly to comparison to the far better war movies out there like Black Hawk Down or Apocalypse Now. In fact there is a scene, reasonably long showing how our main character in Hurt Locker cannot cope with normal life at home. In Apocalypse Now Martin Sheen lies on his back in a sweaty bed and thinks out loud ""When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said ""yes"" to a divorce. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse."" and it had a greater impact.

3861855,2,B00275EGX8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

After reading many posts about 'HL', I've come to the conclusion that members of Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squads in the military are professionals who do a tough job well. There is nothing glamorous about being an EOD but 'Hurt Locker' is determined to give these soldiers the Hollywood treatment. Hence, one might come to the conclusion that there IS something exciting and glamorous about being a member of an EOD squad.

SSgt. William James is more like a Mel Gibson loose cannon character from the Lethal Weapon series than a disciplined professional performing a difficult but routine job. Hollywood loves these loose cannon types but such a type does not really fit as a member of an EOD squad. Common sense will tell you that no EOD squad member would try and disarm an IED by going right up to it and cutting the wires with a plier. The bombs are always disposed of from a distance (as shown in the first scene with a robot--before it breaks down) so as not to endanger any soldiers or civilians in the vicinity.

Quite a number of people who liked this movie felt there were too many 'quibblers'--that movies are not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's true but there should be a modicum stab at realism, especially when attempting to depict the gritty reality of the Iraq War. When an insurgent attempts to blow up a car loaded with bombs (without also trying to take out the soldiers at the scene) that seems a bit far-fetched. But to make matters worse, the car doesn't blow up even though it's totally on fire. But instead of letting the car burn (which might lead to an eventual explosion), SSgt. James puts the fire out and then disarms the bomb himself, wasting precious time and putting himself and his comrades in harms way.

The EOD Squad seems to go everywhere outside their base without an escort. That would never happen in the real Army. What's more, most Army movies have interesting superior officers but not here. There's one good scene where a gung ho Colonel congratulates James for his loose cannon exploits but he's only on for a minute. There is also the Shrink who wants to see what's in like out in the field. Again, without an escort, he ends up the easy victim of an IED.

The point is made that James becomes more and more unhinged as he is on the verge of completing his tour of duty. After he finds a boy dead after being tortured in a bomb factory, he mistakes him for another boy who sold DVD's to him in a marketplace. Wholly inappropriately, he kidnaps a merchant from the marketplace who he suspects of tipping off insurgents. Without regard to the consequences, he forces the merchant to drive into town and give him the name of someone who might have given the boy up. He even tells the merchant to wait for him while he goes into the house of an innocent Iraqi family but of course the merchant drives off. The whole pointless enterprise is resolved when the man's wife hits him and he runs out with a huge welt on his forehead. What's more, no one reports James when he returns, even though he's stopped and searched by sentries at the entrance to the base.

Things get even more bizarre when James and his fellow EOD squad members are ordered to investigate a tanker explosion in the 'Green Zone' (how a tanker could get into the Green Zone, the most heavily protected area of Baghdad, I have no idea). Anyway, James gets the idea that this was not the work of a suicide bomber but a remote detonation near the scene of the explosion. Without a clue as to who might have been behind the crime, James orders the squad into an adjoining neighborhood where they (implausibly) split up and search for the faceless perpetrators. One of his guys is almost kidnapped but is saved only after James kills the bad guys but ends up shooting his EOD buddy in the leg. Again, James never gets into trouble for his antics and the whole incident never seems to be reported to his superiors.

Despite the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest. The depiction of the different kinds of explosive devices the insurgents keep coming up with seems pretty convincing (they even go as far as booby trapping the body of a boy they recently tortured and killed). While pure Hollywood hokum, the denouement, where James attempts to save an Iraqi man who has changed his mind about being a suicide bomber, is pretty exciting (again, no EOD squad member would be allowed to try and save a man in that position since such actions could jeopardize everyone's lives at the scene).

While it appears that the film's scenarist did a modicum of homework finding out what's it like to be an EOD member in Iraq, he had little success in developing his characters. The interplay between James and Sgt. Sanborn was clichd at the beginning, with the conservative Sanborn attempting to keep the wild James in check. Later the conflict dissipates and the relationship devolves into a flaccid buddy flick where the characters are reduced to enjoying themselves by punching each other in the stomach. The shaky hand-held camera technique gives the picture a documentary feel and the dialogue at times seems amateurishly improvised.

Although Hurt Locker has been classified as an 'indie' film, it's really a traditional Hollywood picture. While HL doesn't shrink from showing the horrors of war, the protagonist, James, is the typical gung ho American hero that John Wayne would have probably loved. I am willing to forgive Hurt Locker for its implausible moments but sadly there isn't enough conflict generated between the principals to qualify as true art house fare.",1268006400,9,5693,4.6906906906906904

The Hurt Locker is full of the same military cliches that every action movie has:  the main characters answer to no one, they do what they want when they want, and break off into random one-man-army moments like clearing buildings or taking to the streets at night to hunt down bombers.  This is the kind of thing that makes a movie interesting, sure, but it is not accurate.  The inaccuracies mount when you compare how the procedures and tactics of this unit are not consistent with our Army EOD teams.

3861857,5,B00275EGX8,"Every year there comes a little film that blows audience and critic alike out of their seat.  These movies are often unheard of until a viewer sees the first theatrical trailer, or is told by a friend that they should give it a try.

For 2009 that little film was the Iraq set military drama entitled `The Hurt Locker' directed by Kathryn Bigelow (ex-spouse of the infamously hard-headed, yet incredibly profitable special effects director, James Cameron who this same year broke his own record set by Titanic in 1997 with his 3D eye candy Avatar).  This film about a SSG William James (marvelously portrayed by Jeremy Renner) is a war film unlike any to be made before it.

Sergeant First Class William James is out of place in Iraq.  He is a rebel in a system that requires precision as well as cooperation.  Perceived as a lone wolf with a death wish James suits up each day and constantly berates the advice and orders of those around him.  For William James this isn't a job: it's his life.  He doesn't fear dying in a ball of flame because that's what gets him off.  James has developed a truly unique addiction as his squad mates soon discover.

William James is addicted to adrenaline; the thrill of knowing that at any moment he could be scattered in a thousand different places.

Naturally this film contains multiple teeth chattering moments involving bomb diffusion, but I'm actually hesitant to call this masterpiece a ""war film"" because war surprisingly has little to do with the plot of the film.  Never once does this film decide to preach about moral of troops, brotherhood amongst soldiers, or even the politics behind the controversial war in Iraq.  `The Hurt Locker' is 100% self-contained and finely focused on its protagonist with Iraq being treated as the backdrop; no more, no less.  In my opinion a ""war film"" will focus on those issues, but The Hurt Locker doesn't even seem to acknowledge those archetypes.

Bigelow directs the film in a manner that only a woman could possibly manage.  Gritty and dark, yet on the same time lapsing into what is clearly fiction The Hurt Locker is a delicate ballet of a constantly changing perspective.  While at times it strives for realism at others it will lapse into action movie style themes...but this is in no way a flaw with this movie.  The way I see this is that William James is an addict to adrenaline and the army is his dealer.  What the audience sees is war from the addict's point of view which of course makes war out almost as if it were a fantasy for James...except for the occasionally lapses in his addiction when he is forced to face the reality of his situation.

Needless to say, this talented woman has come a LONG way since working with Keeanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break.

The pacing of The Hurt Locker is almost like the beating of a heart, which meshes well with the nerve rattling subject matter.  Bigelow pulls every string to make the style of this film mix with its subject material while at the same time allowing it to become an enjoyable action peace with some of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema.

Already many people are complaining about the realism of this movie; choosing to compare it to films such as `Black Hawk Down', `Saving Private Ryan', and even `Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket'.  Not surprisingly the people who try comparing The Hurt Locker to these Grade-A war films is like comparing apples to...watermelons.  It is absurd to compare The Hurt Locker to actual war films because The Hurt Locker belongs in an entirely separate genre.

While those films are directly relating to war (politics, whether war is good or bad, brotherhood of soldiers, etc...) The Hurt Locker is a character study solely focused on a single individual who suffers from an addiction.  The fact that he's a U.S. Soldier serving in Iraq is irrelevant to the heart of this film.

Face it folks, we won't see a war film that analyzes the nature of the Iraq war until U.S. troops have entirely pulled out because until then it's too hard to look over all the facts because things are still happening.  Don't come in looking for the `Apocalypse Now' of Iraq films because you'll not find anything like it until the conflict has been resolved and we've had a few years to recollect on its events.

As it stands, The Hurt Locker is without a doubt the best film of 2009 with an amazing performance from Jeremy Renner and expert direction by Kathryn Bigelow.  I feel that people may not understand it now, but much like Apocalypse Now, or any of Stanley Kubrick's films I believe that this will be a film that the public shall look back on as being something unforgettable.

Thankfully the Academy managed to see The Hurt Locker's value upon release instead of making a decision they would have regretted ten years from now.",1268006400,,4842,4.666666666666667

3861861,4,B00275EGX8,"This wasn't my favorite movie of the year, but I did enjoy it on its own terms: as a taut, suspenseful action thriller with a level of psychological insight that was at least a little deeper than most movies of this genre.

What bothers me is the amount of vitriol leveled at this film by actual soldiers who served in Iraq.  A movie's primary job is to entertain.  Inevitably a few--or perhaps many--actual facts are omitted, fabricated, bent, or altered for the sake of a compelling narrative that should at least convey an emotional truth about the very human characters they represent.  I believe this film achieves the ""emotional truth"" part at the expense of the facts.  I'm fine with that, especially if you consider the following:

Bigelow and her crew made several requests to the U.S. military for assistance and consultation and were repeatedly and categorically refused on each occasion.  Given this lack of access and the budget limitations, Bigelow was forced to sacrifice some accuracy in regard to the soldiers' equipment and, perhaps most glaringly, in the implausibly small number of men on the EOD unit.

Ironically, the U.S. military DOES frequently lend assistance and consultation to bigger budget--and more blatantly untrue--escapist popcorn movies like G.I. Joe or Transformers.

I have a couple of soldier friends who loved the Transformers movies and hated The Hurt Locker.  I can only shake my head.

Hard as it is to discount the evidence of your senses when bombarded with skillful and costly cinematography, the 'gritty realism' of this film is totally unrealistic, full-bore Hollywood. Yeah, there may be scenes of mayhem similar to the scenes in the film at times, but not with such convenient regularity, not even in Baghdad in 2004. And there were innumerable other implausible or outright false details; just look at the one-star reviews here and not how many are written by military veterans.

So, is ""the Hurt Locker"" an anti-military film? Hmm. It didn't strike me that way. Is it an anti-war film? Well, it doesn't glorify war, that's obvious, but it doesn't precisely get tough and analytical about the futility of war either. We all know , whether first hand or not, that war is dangerous to living things, soldiers or kids or old ladies at market. The Hurt Locker DOES depict the absolute futility of America's military occupation of Iraq, but that analysis seems almost tangential to the core of the film, which is the portrayal of Sgt. James, the genuine ""wild man"" who defuses bombs with his bare hands and whose maverick heroism gets several of his comrades gravely wounded, probably unnecessarily. Are we supposed to admire the maverick, or at least to empathize with him? That has to be what the film is asking of us. But the man is an ACTOR, friends! He's good-looking, witty, and he gets soft-hearted about an Iraqi boy with a big smile. The real Sgt James (who wouldn't be allowed such maverick-space in the real army) would not be so appealing. He's a pathological dude, amigos! He's a runaway train you wouldn't want on your tracks. I'm not sure you'd want him coming home to your community, either, even with combat ribbons. The real Sgt Jameses, and there are a few, bring home more trouble than the whole army protected you from. The psych clinics and emergency rooms of America are familiar with Sgt James and his battered wife.

Apparently lots of people were impressed with Jeremy Renner's performance as Sgt James. Me, I thought it was shallow. Anthony Mackie, as the second man on the bomb squad, delivered a more convincing characterization. Can a film this bloody and ugly be bland? It was for me.

Was Director Kathryn Bigalow in Iraq? I have no idea. But she made me believe that I was looking into Iraq at the daily routines of a squad charged with the task of investigating and disarming IEDs (improvised explosive devices).

I've heard that the movie has been criticized by war veterans and others actually in Iraq for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions, but this all seemed very real to me. Sure, it seemed like the cast was under fire and constantly dealing with some IED threat, and maybe that's what the critics are referring to. But it's a movie.

3861873,4,B00275EGX8,"Blessed with an insightful script by journalist Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) has finally found superior material to apply her talents, and the result is a seminal war film set in Iraq.  This is not the spectacle of war in broad strokes but rather an intimate point of view.  As such, it provides a very personal, visceral experience.

In the middle of the Iraq War, Sgt. J T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) welcomes a replacement for a fallen comrade.  The new soldier, Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), is a quirky soul whose specialty is disarming bombs.  38 days are left for Bravo Company as the group sets out to diffuse a bomb.  While an automated robot might be appropriate, James insists on doing the job himself and finds a booby trap in the city streets.  After a tense period and an unexpected surprise, he is successful but not before spooking Sanborn and the other soldiers nearby.  His boldness and gambling has serious consequences for his comrades.

James is a loose cannon, but does he have a death wish?  He has the emotional and physical scars from war, and he lives and breathes bombs to the point of keeping bomb parts as souvenirs.  He is addicted to the job, and war gives his life meaning.  He is the perfect war junkie.  It's a high stress existence and the only person a soldier can rely on is his fellow soldier.  These men bond amid difficult life and death situations while there is barely a shot fired.  This is most definitely not Audie Murphy's kind of war.

The risks escalate when a car loaded with explosives is set afire and as James tries to disarm the device, the soldiers attract a lot of attention from the locals who may or may not be innocent observers.  It becomes a precarious situation by the minute as James' expertise is tested to the limit.  We witness the risks of guerilla warfare as threats come from around any street corner.

As days melt down to hours, the tension becomes almost unbearable, and you can feel the anxiety and fear in these men.  There is an arduous sequence as the group gets pinned down by deadly sniper fire amid an oppressive sun.  Later, a heartbreaking scene has James attempting to defuse a bomb strapped to an innocent civilian pleading for his life.  It's a desperate task as the seconds tick away.  The emotions and the impossibility of the situation make for a compelling moment.

James has a wife and son back home where he discovers some truths about himself.  Finding civilian life difficult to adjust to, he realizes the one thing makes him feel alive, and that is a tour of duty.

Some notable actors like Ralph Feinnes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly appear in what are essentially throwaway cameos.  Mackie is good as a soldier whose priorities in life change dramatically through his deployment, and Brian Geraghty registers as a young soldier who cannot wait to return safely to the states.  But it is Renner who excels in the difficult role of a gifted, but troubled soldier.

Bigelow has always been adept at films (Point Break, Blue Steel) with lead characters under extreme duress, and she milks each bomb sequence with measured, tightly edited cuts to agonizingly prolong and heighten the suspense.  She is schooling the public with pure cinematic technique.  We feel a bit detached from these men not because they are not well drawn but because the film tries to show events in a semi-documentary way especially in its generous use of handheld cameras that give the feel of news footage.

This is not a perfect film.  It feels episodic at times, and perhaps that is the point: that war can be a series of moments of danger and uncertainty.  Also, we never fully realize or understand what makes James tick.  We know he is drawn to his job and is very good at what he does. But we never see into his psyche's attraction to this profession beyond the adrenaline rush.

While the film may not accurately portray military tactics or protocal, it does capture the human emotions of impossibly difficult tasks amid a hostile environment.  Credit the filmmakers for exploring a fascinating aspect of warfare.  In terms of driving home the fear and effects of war on the common soldier, few films have ever been better.",1267747200,,4224,4.704359673024523
3861874,4,B00275EGX8,"Everything is okay until Will goes in search of those who killed Beckham. That is not military, that is not suspense. Then the confusing night scene which culminates in the wounding of Eldridge by Will hurts the momentum of the movie.

The helpless innocent man with the bombs padlocked to his body is pathetic, as is the sight of Will in the cereal aisle of the grocery store, but the power of the movie ended with the sniper scene in the desert with Ralph Fiennes. If Bigelow had removed those later scenes and replaced them with something better, more to the point, the whole movie would have been excellent.

The absurdity of war, the civilian population looking on either indifferently or with concealed lethal intentions, is well done. In one scene there is an Iraqi with a camcorder hoping to get footage of the Americans being blown up.

The character of Will is haunting, the war addict, who is unfit for civilian life and can only go from war to war, defusing bombs until something or someone kills him.

The reappearance of Beckham, who was not after all the dead boy with the body bomb, is a fine irony. To Will, just as much as anyone else, the Iraqis ""all look alike."" Will turns and walks away in disgust at his own error.

Unstated, but palpable everywhere, is the obvious fact that we shouldn't be there, we should be home in our own country. By invading a foreign country we become the victims of its own captive people. They pick us off one by one, and our unfortunate soldiers say, ""They won't come out and fight."" It is Eldridge who says cynically, ""Iraq is death."" If a foreign nation invaded America, we would certainly sow our roads and highways with IEDs, and we would use ambushes and snipers to make the foreign power as uncomfortable as possible. Our founding Fathers did this during the Revolutionary War.

Unfortunately, even most video games out there nowadays have just as much suspense as ""The Hurt Locker,"" but with better storylines.  I have absolutely no idea why this movie is considered one of the best movies of 2009, and can only attribute it to the inherent positive bias that movie critics have for any movie that has a theme of ""War is Bad,"" even if there is no story that goes along with it.  Still, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a good watch on video and much better than the average action movie being made today.  However, I don't think that it's anything special.

3861878,1,B00275EGX8,"I was excited to see this movie, because I had heard good things about it. What a disappointment and waste of time. I found this movie to be DULL...not exciting, or tension filled at all, (as many have claimed).

The movie is predictable. As soon as I saw Guy Pierce, I knew he was going to die, how else to get ""our hero"" onto the team.
When the psychiatrist said he was going out with the team, I knew he was going to die. As soon as I saw the scene with him and that family with the donkey, I knew he was going to be blown up.
As for the scene with ""our hero"" trying to defuse the car bomb, of course he was going to save the day, the movie wasn't over yet. I was hoping one of the men watching him would detonate the thing. Then the movie would be over, or at the least, have one, non predictable moment. No I don't condone violence, but it is suppose to be a war movie, and things blow up.
I digress.
I knew when ""our hero"" was back home he would soon be back into combat, because it is ""easier to deal with war and bombs than the everyday hum-drum of raising and taking care of your family"".

This movie is also erratic. What the heck was up with the scene with Ralph Finnes? What was the point? How come Ralph was so easily picked off by the sniper, while ""our hero"" was moving around like he had ants in his pants and whining about a juice box? Then the random part where the other team member picked off that bad guy trying to come up behind them? The scene seemed unfinished. There was no explanation why Ralph and Co were even out there, or why ""our"" team was out there. No explanation or follow up as to how they all got out of there, other than the still living bad guys just gave up and left. (Which is what I should have done.)

I am not military, but it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to know you don't leave your base in Iraq, in your HOODY, to cruise around Bagdad. Come on. Really?

I did learn one thing that was very disturbing. The brave men and women serving over there have to deal with the gruesome reality of ""body bombs"".
God Bless and Godspeed to all that serve.

Sorry this is so long, but this review has been festering since I saw this, pardon the pun, bomb.
I probably couldn't write a better script, but I'm sure I couldn't write a worse one. Unless of course I took all the war cliches in this one and add the two or three they left out.

I am registering a protest vote against Summit Entertainment's practice of forcing me to sit through three lengthy previews for disinteresting garbage films before letting me get to the main menu and start Hurt Locker.  Most DVDs let you bypass extraneous material by hitting the 'Menu' button.  Not this one.  Shame on Summit.  Even if I were interested in your lame horror movie or your lamer Guy Ritchie ripoff, I'd never rent them on general principle, after having their promotional material railroaded into my living room.

3861880,4,B00275EGX8,"I enjoyed this movie, but after reading some quotes from actual soldiers that served in Iraq, I felt a bit cheated.  The movie centers around an Army EOD (bomb disposal)unit serving in Iraq.  You follow this unit in their everyday activities such as finding/disarming IED's and other bombs.  I commend the film makers for choosing to talk about these soldiers and how dangerous their jobs are.  The real soldiers out there doing this job are hero's in my mind. The film does a good job of showing how scary it is in Iraq and how danger can lurk in any window, alley or building.  What the film does badly though is portraying the leader of the EOD unit as a cowboy who breaks the rules and puts his team in unnecessary danger over and over again.  The character Sgt James is just not believable.  That just killed the ""authentic"" feel of the movie.  I'm not a soldier, but even I can figure out that an EOD unit would not just go off on it's own with no support, not telling anyone, and search for insurgents.  No way.  Sgt James going out alone in a hoodie to find some people?  Not. I also read that the characters were not wearing the correct uniforms in the movie.  I'm sure the producers wanted to ""jazz"" up the movie with some ""drama"", but why?  Is the life of one of these soldiers so ""boring"" that it had to be hammed up like that?  I think nonsense like that just takes away from the film.  What they did get right though, they did well.  The actors are terrific.  Sgt James may be a ridiculous character, but Jeremy Renner did a great acting job with him.  It's a good movie, to be sure, but it has some flaws.",1267488000,3,1620,4.30794701986755

I did not feel like I was being lectured about to politics surrounding the Iraq war; although, you do get the sense that some of the troops are disillusioned by their experiences. No, this seems to be a more personal story about Renner's character and how the intense focus and adrenaline rush he gets from his work develops into an obsession. The man ultimately looses his ability to feel anything or function normally outside the bubble of this razor's-edge existence.  And that is basically the whole point of the movie; to depict the emotional, spiritual, and psychological damage that this war and, particularly, the IED disposal team sustain under such pressure. These guys are definitely heroes but even those that get through it intact pay a heavy price.  The story is very intriguing, the acting is nothing short of stellar, and the documentary like style used to film it is quite effective in conveying the sense of dread that drives most of the movie's ""action"" sequences.

3861885,5,B00275EGX8,"Action film meets character study in Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER.  The film follows three members of an Army bomb squad (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty, all excellent) as they bond and diffuse bombs.

If the film has one main flaw, it's that there's no real plot; this will obviously be a deterrent to more mainstream war movie fans, who like bombs and bullets and blood, and not necessarily any sense or heart.  It will also be a disappointment to those who want a film that glorifies the war in Iraq, or those who want a film that demonizes it.

And yet, it is these three main points that make THE HURT LOCKER such a treasure.  It isn't just bombs and bullets; yes, there are those, but this is a movie with heart.  Likewise, it isn't a ""war"" film per say; it is a human film, about the people who fight the war.  It actually manages not to take a political stance, which is a move so tedious I previously thought it impossible.  The film is about the characters (specifically Renner's Staff Sergeant James) and how they cope with their environment, and why they do what they do.  In fact, when something resembling a plot pokes its polished head in the second half, the film actually falters; but we quickly get back to the characters themselves, and everything ends on a high note.

Needless to say, Bigelow's come up in the world.  We're talking about the director responsible for POINT BREAK, one of those action films (many of which star Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, or Gary Busey, come to think of it) that's only good because of how bad it is.  However, the directing behind LOCKER is spot-on; it feels real, it puts you on location.  The script by Mark Boal (the scribe behind the slightly more political, but still excellent, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) is likewise solid, and the special effects are so real they're frightening.  Of course, a film couldn't be good without solid performances, and we get those here from everyone involved, from the three leads to cameo roles by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, and others.  THE HURT LOCKER winds up being one of those rare movies that is both vividly entertaining and emotionally powerful; it has genuine staying power.  If you want to watch an unbiased look at war, you could do a lot worse than this film.",1267315200,,2298,4.6093366093366095

3861887,5,B00275EGX8,"I was thoroughly enthralled by ""The Hurt Locker"".  It's a war film without the absurd bravado and fake special effects.  Heroes like Sylvester Stallone and, in an earlier time, Ronald Reagan, are also completely absent.  If it's possible, it's an art house war film.

The essence of the story revolves around the lives of a three man Explosive Ordinance Disposal team in Iraq.  Each of the men is very different. The team's leader, Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) is a war junkie.  He seems to love the adrenaline of the moment.  Unfortunately, this leaves him prone to rash and foolhardy decisions.  His two juniors, Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, are not happy with his approach; they are just counting down the days to when they can leave Iraq.  As the days count down, the team has many close shaves.  It is these close shaves that keep the viewer on edge.  Defusing ordinance requires great courage and a cool nerve.  The viewer feels the emotion by the bucket load.

The essence of James' character is seen briefly near the conclusion of the film.  He has trouble adapting to civilian life.  He wants more of the adrenaline.  It is his lust for excitement that drives the movie.  It is a white knuckle ride at times.

""The Hurt Locker"" deserves an Oscar.  It is a modern war classic.  It also deserves a wider audience.  Perhaps a nod from the Academy will help it extend its reach?",1267315200,,1389,4.680497925311204

3861890,3,B00275EGX8,"""The battle rush is a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" This sums up the conundrum of the Hurt Locker, a film displaying the 'days in the life of' a bomb-defusion team of soldiers in Iraq whose job it is to analyse and resolve bomb scenarios - on a daily basis - in the dusty and tense neighbourhoods of Baghdad.

The movie, compellingly shot with almost a 'reality-show' feel, is (as almost every reviewer commented) one of the more authentic war movies appearing for some time. No sensationally cool explosions and barely a soundtrack, no bullets thrashing everything but the good guys, no just-in-time rescues or escapes (e.g. Tears of the Sun), no distracting side-mission (e.g. Three Kings), no unreal defeat of an army by one man (e.g. Rambo) and so on.

What's  even more interesting, though, are the hidden (or not so hidden) dimensions of meaning within (or hovering on the margins of) the movie.

On one hand, it's a tale of courage and sacrifice for a war-torn community at war with itself. Sgt. Will James and his team count down their days in Baghdad going from street to building to bomb-site either trying to stop bombs from exploding or exploding bombs before they hurt people. In some scenes, the team struggles with the tension of keeping safe as opposed to (usually Sgt. James himsef) going the extra mile to resolve the situation or catch the bad guys. Will may personify, on this view, the American martyr-in-motion risking death from fiery shrapnel so a battle-ravaged people can have fewer bombs on their streets. It's the American soldier as model of Good-against-Evil humanity to balance off America the War-Crazy Nation. The  movie in this sense operates as a poster for the Global Patriot with a conscience.

On another hand, The Hurt Locker could be 'standard' Hollywood-fare displaying the mundane horror, hatred, victims and meaninglessness of war so the average media-drenched consumer at home 'connects' better with the war veteran, wounded and dead. The movie's thus a vehicle for social integration, war 'awareness', giving human faces to the War on Terror. The many jagged scenes of civilian confusion, the 'normality' of those planning the bombings, the internal resignation and hopeless faced by the soldiers themselves all make the movie seem like an updated desert-context version of Platoon.

Then again, maybe this story ISN'T about war at all. Maybe it's not about how to 'make it' through weeks of almost certain death. Maybe instead the Hurt Locker is about 'surviving' the depression and superficiality of everyday 'peaceful' existence i.e. of Life as we know it.

There must be a reason why the central character, Sgt. William James, is named after a philosopher cum psychologist who wrote about pragmatism and how we need to CREATE reality as the part-and-parcel endeavor of understanding it. Truth-value makes sense only the context of use-value i.e. if it doesn't help or doesn't work, it's pointless to discuss it (let alone enshrine it into some philosophical canon).

Sgt. James, therefore, could be the embodiment of the drive to 'fix it', to go near problems no one dares to. Will's will to spending his life defusing bombs is a decision which releases him from the need to ponder life's absurdities - like a divorced ex-wife who still stays at home, like the myraid of cereal choices the supermarket offers, like the death of children, like war, like the very need to ponder at all.

What would cause a man, after going home and seeing his family (and even playing with his baby son) to choose to RETURN to a whole year defusing devices which could level entire streets and leave hundreds dead? What is so addictive about being face to face with death each and every day?

Could it be that bomb defusion becomes the substitute for defusing life? Selecting the right coloured wire to cut may be the ultimate pragmatic act because life becomes (very practically!) focused onto one - and only one - activity which, if done incorrectly, brings everything to a smoky end.

The Hurt Locker, perhaps, doesn't represent the space into which men and women are trapped by the pain of war. The *locker* could, instead, mirror the *numbing unbearable hurt of the void of everyday living* from which - other than, say, being incinerated in the heat of detonated C4 - there is no escape.

3861892,4,B00275EGX8,"When facing a tiger, you run, hide, or face it head on. In THE HURT LOCKER, the tiger is the ever-present possibility of being blown to bits, and the main character faces it head on.

Set in Iraq, the three men of Bravo Company's EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) team have a healthy respect for roadside bombs. But despite taking all precautions, disaster strikes, leaving the team down a man. The replacement, Staff Sergeant James, is a self-confident veteran of Afghanistan whose first act is to remove the protective barrier over the windows of his barracks. He declares that he likes the sunlight and that the plywood won't protect him from an impact on the ceiling, anyway. It's the first hint that his world view might be a little different from that of the other members of the EOD. The first mission leaves no doubt of that. Upon arrival at the scene of the improvised explosive device (IED), SSgt. James refuses to use the remotely controlled robot, opting instead to wear ""the suit"" and search for the bomb himself. Since the bomb could be detonated at anytime from any of the buildings lining the street, SSgt. James' choice to go on foot seems insane, especially to his own men. Everyone, including the audience, is left wondering what would make a man take such unnecessary risks, but SSgt. James does so time and again. It is absolutely no surprise when, at the close of the movie, we see him returning to Iraq for another 365-day tour of duty. The simple fact is that he loves his work.

I couldn't write this review for several days after seeing THE HURT LOCKER. I had to let it simmer on my subconscious for a while. The filmmakers wisely chose to stay away from any political statements and any kind of subjective commentary by the characters. All of the characters are 100% believable (to a civilian, at any rate), and they all seem 100% sane within the context of their own actions. This is to say that while I would not don the suit and march up to an IED, I do not see SSgt. James' willingness, nay eagerness, to do so any more insane than a racing driver who loves to roar around the track at more than 200mph. This man loved his work. It focused him and made him feel alive. And he was very good at it.

The movie also reminded me of classics such as The Best Years of Our Lives, the William Wyler movie that depicted the difficulties of returning WWII veterans. While THE HURT LOCKER doesn't dwell on this aspect, it shows it starkly in about 3 minutes worth of scenes. The most jarring is a pair of scenes which start with a horrible incident in Iraq and switch almost immediately to SSgt. James back home in a grocery store aisle trying to decide which of 500 boxes of cereal to buy. I watched that thinking, ""Free Willy!""

Also of note is the lack of blood and guts in the movie. They didn't need it to tell the story. There was some crude language, but, and I am not exaggerating, there was more of that in Trading Places, which I watched again recently. The acting was all top-notch and believable, made doubly so by some A-List cameos who get killed after 5 minutes on screen. I sat there thinking, ""But I liked him. I wanted to see more of him. He can't be dead."" As I pondered this later, I realized that perhaps that was the intended effect. Perhaps, and if so, then it was genius - this was a way to make the movie more personal.

I also think it's worth spelling out that THE HURT LOCKER is not so much a war movie as it is a movie set in a war. The characters could have been firefighters or cops or any number of high-danger professionals, and the story would still have worked. Even so, I wouldn't change a thing. THE HURT LOCKER works just fine as it is.",1266969600,5,3696,4.42143906020558
3861893,5,B00275EGX8,"It's really difficult to imagine how this film was made without any assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces, but they did it. The Army felt this was too much of an anti-war story. But I guess that depends on your point of view. Showing the horrors of war is not necessarily anti-war. It's just a taste of reality. And in this case, it's a bitter taste.

Exploring the activites and emotions of an Army Explosive Ordinance team, The Hurt Locker was filmed in Jordan, not in Iraq. But I don't think anyone besides an Iraq War veteran will know this wasn't filmed in the war zone, with real troops and live ammunition. It feels like the real thing. Not so much documentary style as I had imagined. The actors are wonderful. The writing is crisp and concise. The photography is amazing. And the entire story is completely believable. It's no wonder The Hurt Locker rocked the 2010 BAFTA awards, winning best film, director, original screenplay, editing, cinematography and sound. I have no doubt that the film will also sweep the Oscars.

I hate to single anyone out of this superb cast, but I have to say what a pleasure it was to see Guy Pearce in the role of Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. I've long admired his acting, and wished to see him more often. Jeremy Renner and Ralph Fiennes also turned in predictably solid performances, which I'm sure raised the bar for the less experienced members of the corps.

I'm told the budget for this film was only $11 million. Which, when compared to $200 million dollar blockbusters, is an unimaginably small budget. But you will never know, from watching this film, that there was any ill effect from such a thrifty production. It looks and feels like the award winning accomplishment it is. And that only adds to my admiration of director Kathryn Bigelow (James Cameron's ex-wife), and her talented crew. I just can't heap enough praise upon this gem.

Whether you view this as pro-Army, or anti-war, or just plain shocking, you have to say this film is thought provoking, deeply emotional, and I feel, honestly presents the bravery, patriotism, and esprit de corps of the men you'll find in our military today.

Update 8Mar; Congratulations to Kathryn, and the cast and crew for 9 Oscar nominations, and 6 Oscar awards including BEST PICTURE!",1266969600,3,2282,4.738035264483627

3861899,3,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt locker is a decent war flick, although with Youtube and Cnn and the likes what goes on overseas isn't exactly a mystery anymore especially since alot of soldiers have been sharing their footage with the world. The Hurt Locker pretty much is a movie that tries to be as close to reality as possible while still being a movie. The movie mainly focuses on the tasks of a bombsquad unit, and their ""unique"" replacement bombtech after the previous one is kia.

 The hurt locker doesn't ever go in to detail about the characters or who they are. Even the main character remains pretty much a mystery till the end. The acting is great, and the focal point of the story ""being an American soldier in Iraq"" is shown pretty well for what the movie is. I know there has been post after post about how this movie doesn't exactly mirror military protocal etc etc. but look... I never heard a Vietnam vet complain about Apocolypse now, Plantoon, or Full metal jacket... you don't see WWII veterans complaining about Saving private Ryan. So what if it's not line for line... this is a ""movie"" so please keep that in mind.

 There's a lot of good action in the film, but it's predictable. The movie has the habbit of going into ""widescreen"" whenever something is about to happen. Also the movie isn't ""gory"" it's more dramatized violence than what you would actually see. Like if a soldier was blown up you'd see his helmet roll by, or if someone got shot you would just see their body fall. Not much blood to be shown in this war movie so it's more or less about the dialogue.

 Since the characters pretty much remain a mystery to you there's not really anyone to root for. Watching the Hurt locker kind of felt like catching a good movie half way before it ends. It's good and you enjoy it, but you missed the first part of it that explained all the detail of what's going on. That is why I rated the film a 3/5. It's not a bad or dislikable film by any means, it's just that you never really get to understand who the characters are or where they are even from that makes them do what they do, and act like they act.",1266624000,5,2113,4.363867684478372

3861905,4,B00275EGX8,"Definitely engrossing, ""micro"" view of counter-insurgency warfare in Iraq, with a small bomb-squad. In a sense the movie is a personality assessment, with the main character (James) being an arrogant, selfish, virtually sociopathic pursuer of the ""thrill of nearly dying.""  I can't agree with the thesis of the film ""War is a Drug,"" because although I've never been in a war, I really doubt that those who have been in serious combat think that way, especially when their compatriots are getting killed.  Is war exciting?  I'm sure of it.  But I believe that soldiers enlist for far more than ""the adrenaline rush"" that James seems to be addicted to.  (love of country maybe?  loyalty to their fellow soldiers?  Wanting to do good in the world?)

In the film, the tense battle and bomb-defusing scenes give one the strong impression of being within a combat operation (without risking one's own life of course!  Isn't that why we like war movies?), and many unexpected things happen. Thus the entertainment value is high.  But I ALWAYS look at the underlying messages of movies, not just for entertainment.

The main character definitely thinks he's indestructable.  I call him borderline-sociopathic (or narcissistic, or abusive) because I've known men like him, and I believe that they have a personality of extreme selfishness and the desire to ALWAYS be the guy on top & bossing everyone around, often seeking high danger. (BTW If you know someone like that, my advice is to get away!  Don't work with them, befriend them or marry them!)  I don't know how such a person would really hold up in the military -- he might not last long, because he's constantly putting his comrades in danger.  But the good thing about The Hurt Locker is that the other 2 main characters in his squad (the black Sargent and the specialist) have a hard time dealing with James and tell him so on many occasions.  So the director ""gets it"" in a way.  But I hated it when James called the black Sargent ""boy"" when they were drunk -- what a flipping abusive ass he comes across as!

The Iraq environment is realistically portrayed as tense, and alternately filled with teeming crowds (from whom you have no idea who your enemy is) and barren desert.  I'm interested in whether the Iraqi (insurgent) men are portrayed accurately.  If the director got it right, they look extremely defiant, always pushing the limits, very two-faced, ruthless, and always defying death themselves, in their zeal to kill the US soldiers.  I'd be interested if soldiers that served over there think that the movie got this right.

Altogether I have to give the film 4 stars for its gritty realism and entertainment value, although it's still got its flaws.",1266278400,,2715,4.843817787418655
3861906,4,B00275EGX8,"This is a very good movie, it was very well directed and the acting is outstanding.  Filmed in Jordan, it is also extremely realistic looking in the portrayal of a mideastern city and the residents, although many Iraq veterans are critical of the film's depiction of how the army and the EOD teams actually operate.  The movie centers entirely on the three members of the EOD (""bomb squad""), particularly the squad leader Sgt James, extremely well played by Jeremy Renner.  In-between the bomb disarming scenes, the movie develops the relationships between the three men and especially explores the character Sgt James.

The one thing this movie lacks is any actual storyline or plot as such.  At the beginning of the movie Sgt James arrives; there are a bunch of individual action segments depicting disarming bombs or perhaps the squad being pinned down by a sniper; and then the movie ends with a segment that completes the portrait of Sgt James' character.  The action segments are unrelated and in fact could be rearranged in almost any order with minor changes for continuity.  There is no unfolding ""story"" that builds to a climax and then is resolved at the end.  The only thing that is ""built"" throughout the movie is the relationships between the squad members and the character study of Sgt James, and in fact it is that character study which provides the movie's climax (in a scene between him and his toddler son, where we understand what ultimately drives him).  Basically, this movie is NOT plot-driven but is more of a character study.  With bombs.

The bomb sequences provide most of the suspense for the movie, and they are very gritty, white-knuckle hold-your-breath scenes.  Unless you find disarming-bomb-scenes to get a little old after a while, in which case you may find yourself patiently waiting through them.  Even so, the other elements of the film - the realistic-looking portrayal of the environment, the extraordinary acting, the evolving of the relationship between the team members, and particularly the depiction of the character Sgt James - all add up to an excellent film.",1266192000,2,2108,4.971509971509971

3861909,4,B00275EGX8,"I didn't know what to expect from The Hurt Locker. The rave reviews and hype suggested it was just propaganda for the war (""Yeah, war is horrible, but...""), but I wanted to see for myself. I was actually quite surprised. Yes, it's got some propaganda elements. The horrors of the war in Iraq are understated in the film. Where's Blackwater? Where is the random murder and rape of civilians and children? Lacuna like these aside, the film is interesting. (Spoiler warning!)

The Hurt Locker follows the operations of an elite U.S. army bomb squad as they handle IEDs, car bombs, ""body bombs"", and investigate the scenes of exploded materials. Its fairly realistic look and narrative is probably because it was written and produced by Mark Boal, who spent time embedded with a real bomb squad in Iraq.

The script reveals only what the characters see and experience and for those who are paying attention, the absence of any real explanation for the violence throughout the film is telling. Bombs are discovered, but never their creators. Stashes are found, but never their owners. A young boy is found murdered, a bomb sewn into his abdomen. In fact, except for a sole sniper and his companions, the so-called ""enemy"" is never seen, only assumed to be real. This is understandable, given the fact that armed resistance is a given in any occupied territory. In fact, the only villains seen in the film are the occupiers, like the commander who suggestively orders the murder of an Iraqi man with a survivable wound, or the British (SAS?) bounty hunters dressed in Arab clothing whom the main characters encounter in the desert.

The noticeable absence of any real ""terrorist network"" is particularly evident in two scenes. In the first, the bomb squad is called to investigate a suicide bombing in the Green Zone. The team Sergeant is the only one to point out that it was probably a remote detonation, not an actual suicide bombing. How many remote bombings, committed by persons unknown, are written off as ""suicide bombings"" without any real investigation? In the second scene, some soldiers encounter a ""suicide bomber"" with a bomb vest. While the majority of the near-hysterical soldiers want to shoot the man on site, it's revealed that he was forced against his will, by parties unknown, to wear the vest and approach the soldiers. He was coerced, again by persons unknown.

In fact, while the film doesn't reveal it, the truth is that the vast majority, if not all, of the ""suicide bombings"" in Iraq are orchestrated and engineered by U.S., U.K., and Israeli intelligence to give the illusion of a real enemy, thus justifying an extended occupation and a profitable War Without End against a fabled enemy. The thought patterns concerning the war in Iraq, whether of the soldiers themselves or the American and world public, are built on the false premise that there is an enemy. We naturally ""fill in the blanks"", but only after the key pieces of data have been provided to complete our collective substitution of data. As a result, the absence of a real enemy isn't noticed. It's straight out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nineteen-Eighty-Four/dp/0141036141/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nineteen Eighty Four</a>. (Haven't read it? Do so, and learn a lesson from Emmanuel Goldstein.)

For those readers used to being fed on the unwholesome chaff of the mainstream media rags, these statements may come as a shock. Scoffs of disbelief and the occasional outburst of ""Ridiculous!"" accompanied by frantic gesticulations are to be expected. But in a society where entire professions rely on people deliberately manipulating the truth in order to ""win"" an argument, where policing serves politics and quotas, not care and protection of citizens, where military personnel protect ""national interests"" and not national safety, and where people are so used to lying that it is considered normal and perfectly acceptable, is such a reality really so hard to believe?

When we consider some facts that, taken separately, are relatively easy to believe, the situation becomes clearer. Psychopaths thrive in corporations and politics (witness Madoff and Blagojevich), and the violent ones are considered the worst of the worst criminals (most serial killers are psychopaths). And with unlimited black budgets, cannon fodder soldiers, crafty intelligence agencies with generations of experience in making murder look like an accident, political psychopaths (check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Political-Ponerology-A-Science-on-the-Nature-of-Evil-Adjusted-for-Political-Purposes/dp/1897244258/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes</a>), simply by virtue of the scope of their influence, are potentially the most dangerous. While The Hurt Locker doesn't go there, the fact that it leaves the interpretation to the viewer is a relief.

Most might brush this film off as just another war movie made by the liberal media. However, I believe it's anything but just that. What makes this one of the best war films I've seen is that it doesn't so much as focus on just the action as it does on the humanity itself as well as the psychological toll that comes with fighting a war in a country where anyone can -- and most likely will -- kill you. Add the constant unease of being in a job that is as dangerous as bomb diffusion (where every move might be your last) and it's no surprise to see the mental toll it takes on the three central characters. Each moment these guys go into the field, director Kathryn Bigelow easily conveys (with the help of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' on-edge score) the tense moments that fill any soldier's life during war.

Bigelow deserved the Directors Guild Of America award for Best Director and the Oscar. The way this film was shot mostly had the feel of a documentary more than a major Hollywood motion picture. And that (along with using mostly slightly unknown actors) helped the believability of the story. I especially liked that the well-known actors used in the film were more like cameos and were not followed throughout the story (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly).

For those who don't mind seeing films about war, this should be a must. For those who don't even like war films, you should still give it a try as I find it an essential viewing -- not just in cinema, but also for any film that truly encapsulates a post-9/11 world.",1265932800,,2721,5.615571776155718

From personal experience, Iraq, Qatar, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, and places within those countries, all look different from each other and this film actually got it pretty-close-to-right in this way.

Decent plotline, though it meandered at times.  Decent direction, decent camera work, decent special effects.  Some things coulda been better regarding the production but overall, a pretty well-made action film commenting on the combination of stress and enjoyment (yes, enjoyment) which many men get while performing their duties in war.  Jeremy Renner and Brian Geraghty are pretty solid.

If you are in the military and have Iraq experience, be advised there are a number of errors, from the outfitting of HUMVEEs to PPE to uniform wear to the blatant GO violations which are almost rampant.  Units seemingly moving willy-nilly on the battlefield without support or apparently even in radio contact with anyone.  A war crime which simply occurs and no one comments on.

3861921,5,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker,"" brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow from a script by Mark Boal, is set in 2004 during the Iraq War. Baghdad is a tense place for the American soldiers whose mission it is to identify and defeat the insurgents.  Their task is made even more difficult by the fact that anyone could be a potential suicide bomber; any car could be wired to blow up without warning; and IED's (improvised explosive devices) are cleverly hidden.  Staff Sergeant William James, played by Jeremy Renner, is a swaggering, chain-smoking bomb tech who takes insane risks as the team leader of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit in the U.S. Army's Bravo Company.  His disapproving fellow soldiers are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), who prefers following protocol to improvising, and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), a young man who fears that each day will be his last.  Sanborn and Eldridge worry that Sergeant James, who is unbelievably arrogant and reckless, will get them all killed.

Bigelow effectively used hand-held cameras to give her film the look and feel of a documentary.  We hold our breaths as the soldiers embark on one dangerous operation after another.  Each time the men approach a possible bomb site, they must be on the lookout for booby-traps and snipers.  Sanborn and Eldridge provide cover for James, who attempts to defuse the device without blowing up the entire neighborhood.  Needless to say, this is not a job for the faint of heart.

The performances are uniformly excellent.  Renner is superb as a man who enjoys taking apart complicated bombs; he even saves pieces of them as souvenirs.  James briefly shows his human side when he chats about his family back home and befriends a garrulous and brash Iraqi boy. While on duty, however, he is possessed, sometimes stripping off his protective gear so that he can perform his hazardous undertaking more comfortably. Sanborn is a cool customer who gradually succumbs to the stress of living on the edge.  Eldridge is in over his head; he cannot believe that he is stuck in this filthy, stifling, and inhospitable place, fighting a war that cannot be won.

This is a terrifying, disturbing, and intensely moving film, in which Bigelow puts the viewer on the mean streets of Baghdad, where the difference between friend and foe is not always clear.  We feel sorry for both the American soldiers and the innocent Iraqi civilians who are caught in the crossfire.  The movie is slightly marred by an unfortunate scene towards the end in which two characters engage in conversation that is so preachy and heavy-handed that it stands out because of its lack of subtlety.  Still, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a timely and provocative film that challenges us to consider the huge toll that war takes, both emotionally and physically, on the brave men and women who serve their country so unselfishly.",1265760000,,2875,4.95625

The Hurt Locker (2008) is one of the best movies from last year and for me, it is the most deserving nominee  for  Best Picture of the year of five that I have seen so far. The director, Kathryn Bigelow who is known for making the dazzling, dynamic, intelligent and intense action movies, feels at home in the very manly world of directing war film. The Hurt Locker that has been universally praised by the critics and the audiences since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008 may make a history if Bigelow wins the Best Directing Oscar coming March 7th but even if it won't happen, The Hurt Locker has already found its place in history as the remarkable and to the date the best film of the war in Iraq.  It does not explore why we are there and who is responsible for the war. It just places us ""inside"", along with three main characters, the members of a bomb squad as they go about their daily business, doing their most dangerous and unforgiving job in the world, trying to survive the last 39 days of their rotation. The effect of the total immersion was achieved by Bigelow and Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer (United 93) by using multiple S16mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives.

The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq where he would go with the members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks very closely. Based on his experiences, his screen play is the fictional retelling of the  real events.  He said of the film's goal that the creators wanted to show the experiences of the soldiers that we'd never see on the daily news. I believe that director and screenwriter, as well as everyone involved in the making of The Hurt Locker have achieved their goals. The result is an unforgettable film

It is remarkable that the film's more famous actors (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse) only show up for a short cameo leaving Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty to carry movie on their own.  All three do an amazing job. Jeremy Renner, relatively un-known becomes a real center of the film and turns a star making performance.  With the face far from a typical cinema hero, he becomes a true hero of the film, the guy who by the words of his younger comrade is not good with people but a great warrior, confident, cool, good at his deadly job, always having it done. It is about him, the epigraph to the film says, war is drug for he is addicted to the rush that only combat can give him.

I found the film absolutely riveting, gripping, and intense. It is amazingly shot, the  pace is perfect, and the action scenes executed masterfully. It also works as the characters study of the men at war and how the war affects them.",1265673600,2,2920,4.499054820415879

This is a wonderful take on the special unit in Iraq who disarm bombs.  I thought the director Kathryn Bigelow and the writer Mark Boal did a wonderful job of showing the desperation and the urgency of this special unit.  The acting was superb and there was never a dull moment in this wonderful movie.  (I normally HATE war movies!)  I think people need to remember that this is a movie and not a documentary.  As such, there's bound to be inaccuracies.  In order to make any movie that'll keep the audience's attention, you need to exaggerate the situation.  That's just Hollywood.

This movie is apolitical and does not glorify the military or the war.  It is great take on the psychology of our soldiers in Iraq.  I think what I took away from this movie was an understanding of the soldiers' mindset and the appreciation of the decision they made.  As much as I loved Bigelow's ex-hubby's movie ""Avatar"", I think she might win Oscar for Best Director for this movie.  Like a fine wine, this movie lingered on even when the credits were rolling.  The movie was THAT good!",1265673600,,1262,4.6008968609865475
3861927,5,B00275EGX8,I think this was an  awesome movie. We do not see enough of what is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan.. This was well written and very well portrayed.,1265673600,,149,4.137931034482759
3861928,5,B00275EGX8,"A frontrunner for the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, The Hurt Locker deals with a bomb defusing squad on the field in Iraq. When SSG Thompson (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb he is trying to defuse is set off, he is replaced as team leader by SFC James (Jeremy Renner). Things don't quite work out the way the other members of the squad, Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), would like as James is an adrenaline junkie who's prone to not listen to anyone around him. As time goes on he detaches himself further from them, and leads them increasingly into more dangerous situations.

Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James ""King of the World"" Cameron, is a woman who has never rested on her laurels. Each time she steps up to a plate to make a movie she makes something completely different. With Near Dark she hit up horror, with Blue Steel she played with the thriller genre, Point Break took on the action genre, and Strange Days took on sci-fi. Having not made a movie since 2002's K-19: The Widowmaker, Bigelow was looking for a new project. She was trying to determine what movie to make when she sent this script to James Cameron who told her to make this movie. Now Bigelow sits as the front runner for Best Director, only the fourth woman in the history of the Academy to receive a nomination, and may possibly even best her ex-husband for the statuette.

One of the things that stands out about this film, is that it's a war film that doesn't focus on the idea of whether war is right or wrong, whether or not we should be in Iraq, or if our soldiers are doing good things over there. With a job like bomb defusing, one of the great things, is that you're trying to make a safer environment for both your soldiers as well as the inhabitants that reside in the country you're fighting in. Picking this type of job is a masterful stroke, it allows Bigelow to stay out of politics and focus on the true message of the movie: War is a drug. The main character is a junkie, an adrenaline junkie. More and more he refuses to listen to those around him, and seeks bigger and bigger highs.

Really, The Hurt Locker is an excellent character study of how war affects people differently, like drugs, and this war as a drug metaphor is one of the most brilliant things to come from movies based on wars in the past decade or more. On top of that, for an action movie made from only $15 million (that's half the budget of District 9) this movie still looks better than action movies made for over $100 million, with much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, filmed in a style reminiscent of a documentary the film has a certain real life feel to it, like rather than directing actors Bigelow directed a film crew tagging along with soldiers. Unlike many filmmakers these days, Bigelow really knows how to work suspense. Large portions of scenes are waiting for something bad to happen, and you really feel at any moment anyone could die. In a sniper face off, you sit with James and Sanborn on a ridge watching a building kilometers away, worried for your protagonists and hoping that they'll pull of the right shot. The movie doesn't include as much action as you'd expect, but because of the high suspense of the film you feel there's much more action in the film than there really is.

The acting in this film is superb, as can be noted by Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. But, in reality, this cast deserved the SAG ensemble nomination they didn't get. While Renner's role doesn't stand out as the ""addict"" really everyone does such a great job that you honestly feel this could be a documentary where each of these actors aren't actors, but actual soldiers in the field. Of all the things that stand out, there's a great scene that comes later on in the movie, where Renner's SFC James has to diffuse a bomb strapped to a man who's pleading for his life. It's an extremely suspenseful scene that is also touching as James tries to come up with anything he can to free the man from his burden, and the acting in a scene like that is what makes it so suspenseful as you care for these individuals because of their actions and the way that they carry themselves.

I highly recommend The Hurt Locker, definitely one of the best movies of 2009, and one that definitely landed on my top 5 list for that year. If you like war films, suspense, action, drama, and/or a good character study this is definitely one to check out. I know I'll be owning it!

Each year there is a movie that becomes the favorite of the critics and Hurt Lockers is this year's critical darling.
The movie is about the Explosive Ordinance Disposal squad and their routine in Iraq as they go about dismantling IEDS and defusing bombs from potential suicide bombers. This movie follows the three main characters around Iraq and the difficulties of performing well in an environment when one does not know who are the enemy and a friend; the movie was actually shot in Jordan and their daily life. Some are dying to get out of here but the main character Sgt James is absolutely devoted to his job. Note the scene towards the end when he is absolutely clueless in his civilian life while he struggles in the cereal aisle or his conversation with his son and his wife. The movie tries to offer us more glimpses in the life of the two other soldiers but only offers glimpses. Although their job is to keep others same, Sgt James in his zeal and bravado sometimes jeopardizes the life of his companions. Hurt Locker refers to the box kept by Sgt. James which has all the trigger mechanisms of the bombs he has defused.

At times or rather the entire movie has the feel of a documentary but without a doubt the action scenes especially the fire fight and the several bomb defusing scenes have been shot extremely well. Congrats to the camera man and his assistants. The tension is nail biting and translated well to the screen. It shows us the service the men of the Army are doing for us and a standing ovation to these brave men. The movie deserves a look because it is probably one of the first movies that I have seen that does not politicize the movie; the other one was Taking Chance (read my review) There is a lot to recommend about the movie but characters have been half baked and the story line thin. A lot of big name stars are in this film Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce and Evangaline Lilly but blink and you miss them.
This year it is a classic battle of the exes i.e. James Cameroon and Kathyrn Bigelow, I place my bets on Avataar. I gave it three stars. 02/05/10",1265328000,,2105,4.439276485788113

3861936,2,B00275EGX8,"Some interesting cinematography and occasional artful suspense, but the plot was contrived and mundane in the extreme, and where it was just free-floating (almost improvised and documentary like), it was boring. There simply was much too much dead space.

With the format chosen (which granted was daring), the film could ill-afford to just take the low road and become another ""Bad Boy"" military hero story. It needed to jump into another orbit of creativity, and here it did not. Instead, it hewed much too closely to the old tried and true hero's script.

Since there was so much talk about Bigelow possibly winning an award for best director, I was hoping to join the bandwagon, but I expected a lot more and frankly was very disappointed. Two stars",1265328000,,753,4.875
3861937,3,B00275EGX8,"Now that Hurt Locker has received nine academy award nominations, I have one question:  Why?  Perhaps the kooks in La-La Land perceive it as anti-war even though the film was gratefully free of political rhetoric.  I note that another review here by an alleged former leader of a bomb disposal team showers praise on this film.  I cannot argue with his expertise on the subject - if he genuinely is experienced in this aspect of warfare - but I do know that the film did little to affect me except to trouble me that this might depict the real behavior of soldiers in the field.  My son, a PFC in the Army Reserves, agrees with me.  Some of the scenes were gripping, and the frustration that the proliferation of IUDs in the Middle East brings - to the extent this movie depicts it accurately - was brought to light well.  Jeremy Renner did a fine acting job, but I hated his character when he should have engendered sympathy.  I wanted to relieve him of duty, send him to the brig, and put a sane person in his place.  His interaction with the Iraqi boy never played out fully, and I could see no reason why the soldier became so involved when he was otherwise so loony.  The scene where the Iraqi couple drove him away made no sense, and the birth of his own son seemed tossed in at the last moment.  Something tells me that much of this film fell to the cutting room floor to adhere to the two-hour rule and left serious gaps.

3861939,3,B00275EGX8,"The Bottom Line:

The Hurt Locker is a decent film with a persuasive performance by Jeremy Renner in the lead, but long after it has convinced us of its central premise (""war is a drug"") it keeps pounding the point home, leading to a running length that feels padded and several moments in which the pace slows to a crawl; I *wanted* to like this movie as much as everyone else but aside from the opening and closing action sequences it lacks tension and is certainly not the best film of 2009.

I was disappointed and saddened to realize that some people will believe this is how our soldiers conduct themselves. But of course Hollywood loved it, which only makes sense when you see it and realize it was more Hollywood than military. This could have been a great movie, and the topic hardly needed the additional and fictional drama they added for effect. It's little wonder why people have such stereotyped thoughts about our soldiers when movies like this only only portray the negatives. According to this movie, they are mostly rogues going out on their own, or else about to break from PTSD. Yes, PTSD and other stress-induced issues are very real among those who serve.

Then in December Avatar appeared.

A curious coincidence of these two movies is that James Cameron, Avatar and Titanic director was once married to Kathryn Bigelow director of Hurt Locker.  As the Oscar nominations are due to be made this week, the stage is set for a compelling David and Goliath showdown.  The two big nominations are Best Director, and Best Movie, but also Best Original Screenplay.

Although I loved Avatar, I would love to see Hurt Locker pick up at least one of these awards.  The most likely would be Best Screenplay.  Certainly the awards would mean more for Hurt Locker and Bigelow than for Avatar and Cameron, which has now surpassed Titanic's world record Box Office. I am all for Hurt Locker, and Bigelow.

Update. 2/2/2010.  Hurt Locker has won 50 awards already, garnering widespread appreciation. It has now been nominated for 9 Academy Awards, including the ones I mentioned, Best Director, Best Pictture, Best Original Screenplay, and also Best Cinematography, and Best Editing.  Avatar also got nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and Inglourious Beasterds for 8, rounding out the leaders of the pack.

They did a nice selection in the location of the film as it did look a lot like Baghdad.  However, the story line was too flawed.  I was a bit confused why the soldiers were wearing ACU uniforms as, while I was there, those were not issued.  The film supposedly was taking place in 2004.  Soldiers were still wearing the DCU uniforms in 2004.  I was highly disturbed by the portrayal of the main character having no accountability.  He seemed to go where ever he wanted, when ever he wanted and did what ever he wanted without having to answer to a higher commander.  This of course, any veteran, anyone in the military, will tell you simply does not happen.  There is always someone that you have to answer to for your actions.  When he snuck off of post to find Beckhams father was just absurd and pure Hollywood.  I was disturbed by the scene with the team of EOD guys drinking.  Alcohol was forbidden and still is.  Of course there were many soldiers who obtained alcohol, but by and large, most did not drink.  To see an entire ""team"" sharing booze together just was not very realistic.  The team also always seemed to operate independently.  They never seemed to be with anyone else and never had support.  Watching the three of them clear a building by themselves was silly.  Why was ther enever any supporting infantry units?  They traveled by themselves in a lone hummer.  In 2004, if I remember correctly, we were not allowed outside the wire unless we were in a convoy of at least 3 vehicles.

In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely eschews the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unenviable job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James, who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge who are assigned to communicate with James via a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Sanborn and Eldridge are still reeling from the sudden death of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Thompson, when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his extraordinary resolve. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original bravado indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and kinetic editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a narrative, although in this case, her own singular sense of filmmaking bravado overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is a terrific find as James because he manages to deepen the character's cocksure attitude with every traumatizing episode and without the need for sentiment.

That's because he conveys both the uncompromising concentration and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the desperation of a free-for-all combat zone. Illustrating their characters' inner conflict in different ways, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more humanistic perspective, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially affecting in his climactic confessional scene. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos.

Let's hope for UP IN THE AIR; not the greatest film ever made but very entertaining, and moving at times too. I was neither entertained nor moved by HURT LOCKER.",1264723200,5,1045,4.843575418994414
3861955,1,B00275EGX8,"I think this movie is a lock to win Best Picture. Why? Two major reasons:

1. It's boring! Critics love movies where nothing ever happens, or, as they will insist, ""the drama is beneath the surface"". Yes, a movie cannot truly achieve greatness unless 4 years of film school are required to ""grasp the subtleties"". We are spending 10 minutes of screen time staring at a sand hill in the desert not, as you may suspect, because the director couldn't think of anything else, but so that we can ""feel the tension"". Was the dialogue composed of random bits of conversation picked up by stray boom mikes? It may seem so to the average viewer, but a true movie buff will see the deep significance here. Trust me on this.

2. It's about an extremely depressing subject that Hollywood knows nothing about. Voting for movies about war, genocide, poverty, and other things that they hear about on NPR allows Academy members to show us how ""tuned in"" and ""empathetic"" they are. Of course, when one spends all of one's time at awards galas, it's difficult to check the accuracy of such movies. No matter though, because everyone will be impressed by the amount of effort it took you to come to such complex conclusions as ""war is bad"" and ""genocide should be stopped"". (And yes, I am a liberal Democrat, but I am SO SICK of heavy-handed ""message movies"".)

In an average year, a movie with only one of these shining characteristics might have a hope of winning. ""Avatar"" and ""Up in the Air"", for example, both beat viewers repeatedly over the head with their messages of ""environmentalism is good"" and ""the country is in recession"". Other critic's picks are excruciatingly boring. But only The Hurt Locker has the twin power to bore the premiere attendees to sleep AND make them think about us little people on their way to the afterparty. Engrave the  Oscar now.",1264636800,11,1850,4.6656441717791415
3861956,5,B00275EGX8,"I highly recommend this movie.  If at all possible it should be viewed without interuption becaise of the continued increasing amplification of suspense during the film.  This movie is about bomb squads in Iraq and it very artfully reflects the tension present when our soldiers are doing their jobs in disarming IED's.  The big differnce between this film and other contemporary war movies is that this film rides on suspense and the character of the soldiers as opposed to continued violence.  I am not familiar with the director of this film.  But she has directed a movie with a skill that perhaps no man could do.  This may sound sexist, but I firmly beleive her viewpoints were what made this film so unusually good.

3861959,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker is an artistic thriller about a trio of bomb defusers in war-torn Iraq. I use the term ""artistic"" because, rather than have a conventional 1-2-3 plot and a jingoistic, war-is-hell undertone, this film brilliantly combines moments of incredible suspense with scene after scene of rare restraint and perception. The film ostensibly is about what the men encounter during their last 35 days or so of their rotation, but goes deeper towards showing the cumulative effect of war on the once normal psyche, in its terrifying as well as intoxicating aspects. Upon first viewing the film I was waiting for the hook, the story, to get going, and was let down after one didn't show itself. As the film progresses, however, you realize that that wasn't its intention, but rather to show the situation in the Middle East with a calmly observant eye. From that tableau we become attuned to the thoughts and drives of the characters in a way not often experienced in a film, to the point where their silences tell you everything you need to know. Not to say that this is a quiet film, for the great majority of it are masterful scenes of direction, acting, and editing that create suspenseful scenes of conflict that are as exciting as anything you're likely to see in a film. This isn't standard war fare, but reaches deeper and gets in your head and stays there. One of the best films of the year, The Hurt Locker is worth many repeated viewings.",1264377600,,1450,4.690196078431373
3861960,5,B00275EGX8,"Like it or not, THE HURT LOCKER is one of the front-runners for best picture at the Academy Awards this year, and is more than likely going to win it, unless AVATAR manages to impress the rather sporadic likes of the Academy officials. I cannot attest to the film's portrayal of the military overseas, since I'm not an enlisted man, so all I can do is judge this film on the impression it made on me. And based on that, I hope this movie does walk away with that award.

The film doesn't have a set story, because war is never all that predictable. It follows a group of three soldiers in the U.S. Army's Explosive Ordinance Disposal team (EOD) as they move from mission to terrifying mission through war-torn Iraq. It's odd how there's very little I can say about the plot, because it really is all about the trade of defusing IED's throughout the country. But the events are shown with such intensity, and such attention to detail, that I really couldn't tell if the next bomb would be the one to kill the main characters, or if they would hopefully make it out safe.

Jeremy Renner gives an outstanding performance as Staff Sergeant William James, who begins to embody the quote that is provided at the start of the movie: war is a drug. He has a mad obsession to thwart his faceless enemy's creations that borders on heated competition and hatred, and he quickly begins to lose himself in it all. He gives the impression of a man who accepted his fate in such a dangerous profession a long time ago, and acts with the abandon that such emotional freedom provides. If he doesn't at the very least get nominated for best actor of the year, I will be disappointed.

The set pieces are set up and shot so brilliantly. The quick cuts and an almost paranoid sense of direction add to the feeling of anxiety that each defusal mission. I was tense and almost frightened by what could happen on each outing, and I didn't relax until the three main characters were safely back at Camp Victory. A movie that can do that has instantly earned my admiration.

THE HURT LOCKER is not so much meant to be watched, but rather, to be experienced. I loved this film's ability to conjure tense situations and link them together with more-than-likable characters. And I respect the filmmakers' decision to leave politics at the door, and create a movie that has nary a hint of bias in regards to a stance on the war overseas.",1264291200,2,2408,4.503432494279176
3861961,4,B00275EGX8,"Journalist Mark Boal was imbedded with explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) technicians, AKA a bomb squad, in Iraq in 2004, where he observed the stresses and perils of Iraq War at its most bloody. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are the defining characteristic of the Iraq War, and that was during their peak, when EOD units saw a lot of action. Director Kathryn Bigelow asked Boal to write a fictional script based on his observations. ""The Hurt Locker"" follows a three-man EOD unit called Bravo Company for the last five weeks of its rotation in Iraq. The team's leader is the new guy, a brazen but highly skilled adrenaline junkie, SSG Will James (Jeremy Renner). He clashes with the professional, even-tempered Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), while the younger Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) has a hard time coping with the death around him.

""The Hurt Locker"" was shot in a documentary style, always using four cameras with different views on the action, so the 44-day shoot in Jordan produced a million feet of film. Don't worry. It's all edited down quite nicely. The downside is that there is camera shake, a style that seems to have taken over contemporary cinema. The advantage is that Barry Ackroyd's cinematography and Kathryn Bigelow's direction bring out the drama inherent in the high-stress, do-or-die situations without seeming to try. Their approach to the material is almost prosaic. This is a day in the life of the bomb squad. And then another day, etc. It is always suspenseful, because diffusing bombs is inherently suspenseful. It is always dramatic, because these men must cope with extreme circumstances, and they do so differently, which can make them uneasy with one another.

Bigelow cast the lead roles with actors who would not be immediately recognizable. We don't have any particular expectations of them, which augments the film's sense of immediacy. We don't' know ahead of time how anyone is going to react to the constantly shifting emotional landscape. But we get a few surprises when more recognizable actors show up in smaller roles. It's a nice touch. And the cast is terrific. Though there is plenty of action (and realistic explosions, not the kind that make pretty orange plumes), ""The Hurt Locker"" is very much a character drama. Three people react to war as they see it and to each other. It's not a political film. It doesn't comment on the wisdom, or not, of the Iraq War. It doesn't tell the audience who to see as hero, villain, or victim. But ""The Hurt Locker"" does give the impression that this is the reality of 21st century warfare.

The DVD (Summit 2010): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, image gallery with audio, and a feature commentary. ""The Hurt Locker: Behind the Scenes"" (12 min) interviews Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, cast, and some creative crew about the films genesis, characters, the director's style, and the cinematography. The ""Image Gallery"" is a slideshow of behind-the-scenes photos with audio from a Q&A with Bigelow and Boal at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. So it gives us something to look at while we listen to the Q&A. The audio commentary, again with director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, is informative and constant. They discuss the locations, cast, filming in Jordan, the explosions, and Boal contributes some observations from his time in Iraq. Subtitles available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

3861970,4,B00275EGX8,"Set in the Iraq War, the movie is based on first hand observations of Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.

The story focuses on Staff Sergeant James, (Jeremy Remer) head of an elite squad of soldiers with a mission to protect and save by disarming bombs of all kinds.  It is not easy and the war zone is full of terrorists, assassins, suicide bombers homemade/improvised bombs.

In 2004, Staff Sergent James takes over the squad after they lost their team leader on a mission.  When James takes over he does not follow the military rules and protocol.  He gets the job done and is recognized as ""wild"" by a superior who asks how many bombs he has disarmed.  The only part of the movie that did not ring true was when he said ""843 bombs disarmed""  - that did not seem realistic, when the margin of error is zero and the variety of bombs.  The bomb team has only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq and the count-down of days on the screen show situation after ungodly situation where their lives are a hair breath away from death.  The movie holds your attention with deep emotional intensity and action packed scene after scene.  We finally come to understand why Jeremy flirts with death - to feel alive.  A regular life is boring and unmeaning to him.

The filming is realistic and it clearly shows the hot, dry, dreary, primitive conditions the soldiers deal with.  The rigors of fighting a half world away, far from the luxuries of home are clearly defined.  After watching you respect even more the psychological, physical and human sacrifice American soldiers face.",1263859200,4,1596,4.573943661971831

Jeremy Renner who I have only seen in a few films does a fantastic job as an adrenaline junkie bomb disarmer who's taste for deadly excitement has more than one of his squad a little nervous. This could have been a ridiculous ""Hollywood"" film, but instead becomes a psychological study of what it takes to do this kind of thing on a daily basis.

They criticize the idea that the main character is reckless and they assume they're stereotyping all EOD personnel. The problem with these comments is that members in his unit constantly criticize him. One made a comment along the lines of ""The only reason I got shot is because you're an adrenaline junkie."" So I would ignore any comments that say ""That's not how soldiers act.""

It really opens your eyes and make you appreciate what military personnel go through over there. It shows you how alert they have to be, the stress they go through, and even gives an example of how being naive for 1 minute can cost you your life.

3861975,5,B00275EGX8,"One definition sometimes given for a ""hurt locker"" is ""a period of extreme physical or emotional pain."" This movie shows that a war can very well be both. It follows an Army unit responsible for disposing of explosives, either by disarming or deliberating exploding them. It follows the three men both on the job and off, providing a window on their characters. Far from your typical war movie, the story is basically about the characters with the war as the backdrop.

During 2004 in Baghdad, Sergeant William James joins Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge in Bravo Company, who have over 30 days left in their rotation. He's replacing the previous team leader who died trying to ""safely"" detonate an explosive device found in the streets. Such is the daily routine in Iraq where explosives are found hidden in anything from a car to a dead body. Eldridge suffers from feelings of guilt, believing his inaction lead to their leader's death. Sanborn and Eldridge soon both become wary of their new leader when James recklessly goes by himself to manually disarm a bomb when they would typically use a robot first. Is James crazy and will he get them all killed?

Bombs aren't the only danger the unit encounters. Driving in their Humvee, they stop when they find a group of unknowns who turn out to be friendlies. It isn't long before they're under fire from enemies hiding out near the sand dunes. Beyond the edge-of-your-seat intensity and violence, there's also a strong emotional component to the movie. James becomes friendly with a young boy selling DVDs on the street and soon discovers the consequences of making friends in a war zone. When an innocent man approaches Army soldiers to ask for help with explosives which have been strapped to his body, James can't do much more than say he's sorry. Despite the atrocities he witnesses on a daily basis, James somehow finds himself drawn to the war. As quoted at the start of the movie, ""war is a drug"".

This movie is so realistic in its depiction of war that it almost feels like a documentary; however, it is far from being dry like some real war documentaries can be. It makes you feel for the soldiers who risk their lives every day, never knowing when or from where the next explosion will come. Although none of the actors truly stand out, it's a great ensemble cast. The writing and direction are first rate and truly make you feel you're in a war zone where anything and anyone around you could be dangerous. I highly recommend this movie when you're looking for an intense, intelligent movie about war.

This film wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it certainly wasn't entertaining.  There were a few scenes which built some tension, like the first with Guy Pierce.  Then ****SPOILER ALERT...LOOK AWAY NOW****, he dies.  I looked at my wife and said, ""They killed off the main guy already?""

Anyway, this movie is slow.  I had to fight nodding off after about 45 minutes.  I think the cinematography was good.  Some of the effects were good.

To me, just about everything in the movie was way too predictable (save for the first scene).  Especially the doc going out on the mission.  As soon as he asked to come along, I said ***SPOILER****, well he's gonna' die.

Anyway, I'm not sure why so many praise this movie (sheep?) (bandwagon?).  Definitely not worth buying!

By the way, anyone notice the crappy packaging?  The Blu-Ray case cover has cut-out areas, to ostensibly save plastic and money?  It makes the case feel paper-thin.  Not good.",1263686400,7,1087,4.631578947368421

The film doesn't argue either for or against the war in Iraq.  Rather, it is about the relationship between man and war itself.

This becomes especially clear in a scene late in the film where the hero returns home.  He has become a warrior;  peace no longer makes sense to him.

It is this implicit warning that war becomes an end in itself that makes this film especially powerful.

I know this is a difficult truth, and a difficult film;  but what has happened in our country that a film this good can't get financed by or released by a major studio?  Are we so busy amusing ourselves with eye candy that truly we are ""entertaining ourselves to death"" while collectively marching towards the precipice?

This movie was bad from the begining.  I am a Navy EOD Tech.  This was supposed to be our ""Top Gun"" for the EOD Community.  All this did was paint EOD as a bunch of wild cowboys.  Now, I'll spare you the inter-service jabbing I'd normally give my breathern in the Army...but this movie was REALLY REALLY BAD!!!

Any number of stunts the character did in the movie would've seen him sent home rather quickly.  Speaking on the ""EOD/military technical aspect"" of the film...it blew chuncks.  Hard.
As a movie...it still blew.  There were a number of scenes that should've been on the cutting room floor, as they didn't flow or even need to be in the film.  Example - a couple of scenes with the kid selling pirate DVDs.  The sniper scene...LOL...horrible.  The scene was there to have the two team members finally ""bond"" because up until then they'd been butting heads.  That scene could've been shot is a number of different scenarios and been much shorter.  I couldn't concentrate on the ""male bonding"" as I was laughing so hard from the Iraqi sniper killing (in a rather rapid rate) moving targets, then couldn't hit the EOD team for the rest of the day as the EOD team was stationary.  P.S.  EOD does in fact use the Barrett, but I'm not sure how much Army EOD spends on the weapon system and is well versed in calling windage and setting dopes.  Few of us in the Navy know how.

I won't bore you with the NUMEROUS military/EOD errors in the film...but it's A LOT!!!!!! (this is soooo hard not writing them all down)

This movie was a bore as well.  I'm not sure why there's so much hype for it being a ""seat of your pants thrill ride"".  It's not.  The only good thing about the movie are the following:
-The close up of the car rust being displaced by the blast wave was cool.  Great cinematography for THAT shot.
-The movie is not preachy as almost ALL current films about Iraq are.  The film is neither pro-war or anti-war.

Well....that's about it.  Borrow it from a friend.  Don't waste your money buying the film and don't waste your time renting or downloading off the internet....",1263600000,18,2187,4.470886075949367
3861981,5,B00275EGX8,"Unlike many of the earlier films on the same subject, ""The Hurt Locker"" starts off by accepting the Iraq war as a given.  That is to say it doesn't try to place the issue in any kind of larger sociopolitical context or to explain why the Americans felt compelled to wage the conflict in the first place.  Instead, it focuses on the everyday activities of a three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (EOD) whose job it is to dismantle, as safely as possible, the literally hundreds of still-to-be-detonated IEDs strewn across the streets of Baghdad.  The leader of the trio has just been killed in the line of duty and has now been replaced by a newcomer whose seeming recklessness and flagrant disregard for protocol doesn't sit well with the other members of the team, who feel that their own survival is being needlessly threatened by his carelessness - especially now that there is less than a month-and-a-half left to go before the team is to be taken out of rotation.

Before getting to the more ""literary"" aspects of the film, let's just say right up front that, on a strictly ""cinematic"" level, ""The Hurt Locker"" is an astonishing accomplishment in every sense of the term.  Director Kathryn Bigelow employs hand-held cameras, razor-sharp editing and an abundance of point-of-view shots to create a film of palpable, nail-biting  immediacy that plunges the audience directly into the heart of the action.  Yet, she punctuates that with the nonstop sound of jet fighters roaring overhead just to remind us that, hard as it may be to imagine at times, there is an even larger war taking place somewhere beyond the reaches of the one we see here.  This story is clearly just one of many.

On a thematic level, the movie explores the various ways these three men cope with the inconceivable stress of life on the battlefield.  Staff Sergeant William James finds an adrenaline-pumping thrill in living life on the edge, of always being just a hair-trigger away from possible death.  Specialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved.  And Sergeant T.J. Sanborn occupies a kind of pragmatic, middle ground between the two, willing to put his life on the line to get the job done but not to willy-nilly just tempt fate for the sake of doing so.  Yet, thanks to Marc Boal`s perceptive screenplay, each man emerges as a complex individual in his own right, never a ""type.""  James, for instance, may be wild and reckless, but he also has a caring, compassionate side that he reveals in off-handed and unexpected moments of tenderness towards others and loyalty towards his men.  And there's a stunning coda that forces us, perhaps reluctantly, to see James in an entirely different light from how we've been viewing him up to that point.

Relative unknowns Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are heartbreakingly effective as James, Sanborn and Eldridge, respectively, managing to create fully realized, empathetic characters amidst all the pyrotechnic war-movie effects.  And even a few familiar faces - Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly from ""Lost"" - show up at various points in the film (in a way, this use of ""stars"" - though obviously done for purposes of procuring financing - could easily have compromised the integrity of the picture, but the unusual way Bigelow uses them helps to mitigate that effect).

The real key to ""The Hurt Locker""'s success is that it never sacrifices intimacy for the grander picture, never allows the war movie setting to supercede the characters and their stories.  It is first, last and always a movie about  ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  It's also unforgettable.",1263600000,2,3808,4.93730407523511
3861982,3,B00275EGX8,"Speechless! Tears flowing down my cheeks as the credits rolled! Could this cinematic MASTERPIECE have been made by someone from our own wretched planet? I think not. Kathryn Bigelow MUST have come to us from an extrasolar location, with directing talent dripping from her wings when she entered our atmosphere! As I watched The Hurt Locker, I kept thinking, ""How can one director take so many individual segments of pure fiction and have the masses falling all over themselves with glowing admiration for the 'authenticity' of this film?"" Just truly AMAZING! Most of the time even average buffoons who've never even been close to a war zone can smell a war movie's fake and contrived nature...But not so with The Hurt Locker!

There are those who LOVE the Iraqi setting (but don't tell them the movie wasn't even filmed in Iraq, OK?). And this movie made me want to join the US Army! I mean, I've always liked shooting Barrett .50 cals in video games and Bigelow shows us you can be a ""former intelligence"" soldier, a current member of an elite EOD team and just pick up a spare Barrett M107 lying around and start picking off bad guys at nearly 1,000 meters...Even a MOVING target! And to think I've been wasting so much time at the range to improve my skills!?!

I was also unaware that the Army had relaxed their ""rules"" so much while in a war zone...Because Bigelow again shows us how you can sneak around in a hoodie, put a pistol to an Iraqi civilian's temple and have him drive you all around Baghdad for FREE (well, like I said before, it's not REALLY Baghdad you know). This has GOT to be saving our brave soldiers a small fortune in Taxi fares! And once you see a home you like, just hop out and walk right in to someone's residence (weapon drawn) and have a look around. I'm sure they won't mind if you take a few things with you before you casually stroll back to the gate of the Base (did I mention this is supposed to be a WAR ZONE Base?). Heck, you don't even get in trouble anymore for leaving the base without a pass and you'll be right back on the job the next day!

Don't like the plywood nailed up over the windows? Just tear it down so you can enjoy a little sunshine with your mortar shrapnel! Bored? Just grab your buddies and hop in the Humvee and cruise around the beautiful Iraqi countryside (well, not really IRAQI countryside). I also like how you can be given orders to investigate an explosion, but you and your buddies can grab your assault rifles and start going through the city streets ""looking for bad guys to blow away""...That's sounds so much better than a stupid video game! Just grab your M4A1 and go hunting for LIVE targets!! I mean, you're in a foreign country so nobody's gonna care if you mow down a few of the locals in the dead of night for some cheap thrills, right? Bigelow shows us this is how our soldiers respond to orders in ""THE NEW US ARMY"".

Bigelow made sure I was NEVER worried about the safety of this EOD Team! Sgt James, the lead bomb tech, is nothing short of a Superhero! He's diffused, what, some 873 explosive devices? And he STILL has all of his digits? He also keeps a piece of each one under his bunk. (I hope I'm not being too picky here, but pieces of 873 bombs would probably take up HALF of the room these guys live in, don't you think?) Sgt James doesn't even CARE if he blows up! He walks up to a flaming car filled with live shells and casually uses ONE fire extinguisher to douse the flames in about 15 seconds. Then he removes ALL of his protective gear and begins grabbing the smoldering steel while slicing and ripping into the car's interior with a pocket knife, not even concerned about triggering an explosion...And why should he be with 873 under his belt? He even stands in the center of a spider IED and yanks the wires right up out of the ground! He walks up to a potential car bomber and puts a pistol to his temple (he's really good at that you know). He uses his x-ray vision to...Wait a minute. Sorry, that's Superman isn't it? In fact, the only time Sgt James fails to diffuse, none of his buddies are hurt. It's the innocent psuedo-Iraqi guy who's blown to smithereens!

This Sgt James guy don't take nothing from nobody! When he gets tired of communicating with his team members, he just turns his radio off. He deploys a smoke grenade as a ""distraction"" so his team can't watch him do his magic. Later, a couple of bad guys are carrying off his buddy and he just opens up on ALL of them with his trusty assault rifle! Of course his buddy takes one in the leg that shatters his femur, but he'll be (kind of) up and walking in a few months...maybe. There's no inquiry as to WHY his buddy is crawling around with one of Sgt James' rounds in his leg. There's no inquiry as to WHY they disobeyed orders and were doing a little recreational night hunting on the streets of Baghdad. I always thought they Court Martialed soldiers for stuff like that. Bigelow show us not anymore...This is ""THE NEW US ARMY"" where there's no longer a need for any intrusive Chain of Command!

Finally, I'd always been led to believe that soldiers killed in war died horrible deaths. Silly me! Bigelow shows how today's soldier can take a sniper bullet right through the chest and DIE in a beautiful 360 degree dive with a half-twist that looks like it was choreographed by none other than Paula Abdul herself...Simply a spiritual experience!!

Since I have no life to speak of, I must watch The Hurt Locker again and again and again just soaking in the awesome beauty and truth that allowed me to forget about my own pitiful life and instead transcend the Earthly boundaries that usually restrict mere mortals from becoming something much, much more...I only regret my mouse-induced failure to give this movie a full 5-stars on Amazon. If I blindly give everything I review 5-stars, then everyone will give me ""helpful"" votes and I'll be invited to join the exclusive Amazon Vine community of reviewers. My mistake, huh?",1263513600,7,5988,4.478021978021978
3861983,5,B00275EGX8,"I remember when Platoon came out. My best friend's dad was first cavalry and spent 6 years - yes SIX YEARS in Viet Nam. He said it was pure crap and hated it. He did love Full Metal Jacket, especially boot camp in the first half. I think Hurt Locker falls into the same catagory and will likely win awards like Platoon. This is a GREAT MOVIE. The characters are amazing, the acting is even better and the sense of tension is unbearable because you feel like someone is going to die in virtually every scene. The Hurt Locker is not accurate. There are a lot of incensed reviews from soldiers, a personal friend of mine (an EOD Tech) didn't make through the first 45 minutes and dismissed it as crap. Because Iraq has been a part of most of our lives for the last 9 years, it still hits close to the heart and I think that watching a movie that is essentially ""entertainment"" can be difficult when you have friends or loved ones still there.

There are three protagonists, and each represents a ""soldier stereotype"". There's the reckless cowboy, soldier doing his duty and the guy who just wants to make it out alive. Reckless cowboy (Jeremy Renner - future acadamy award winner), takes over a squad and the film moves from point to point with different scenerios. There is no real villian, just the environment that they are in. That is part of the greatness of the film. Although it is pretty much all hollywood, The Hurt Locker does an outstanding job of conveying the sense of pressure that soldiers continually have through tension filled scenes that escalate in severity as the film progresses. Those that pan the movie becuase of how far fetched each scene is fail to realize that a film about a night patrol where nothing happens will not be seen by anyone. The tension IS there only of you are a boots on the ground soldier. The Hurt Locker does an amazing job of giving regular people a glimpse of that pressure.

As a film, the quality is simply undeniable. As a BluRay disk, the quality is solid, although not amazing. Being an independent film that didn't make a lot of money or go wide release, this isn't a suprise. I would say from a BluRay disk standpoint, it is middle of the pack. Being a newer film, it still surpasses most movies on BluRay that were released in the early part of the decade, but is no where near the quality of a film like District 9 or Inglorious Basterds. The film is grainy throughout, but that was the way it was made. There are no extras other than a commentary track and on set profile. It would have been nice to see a mini documentary about some realy life EOD Techs or more information about the technology, procedure, training for the film, etc. If it wins enough awards, I would fully expect a second edition that is a Director's Cut or Special Edition with some of these features. As has been the case for MY Blu Ray purchases, I would crush Hurt Locker and drop 1 star on it for the Blu Ray beacuse there really is nothing here. But the movie is just SO GREAT, that I still will give it 5 stars based on the quality alone.

This was my favorite movie of the year. The drama, tension and performances are incredible. The Hurt Locker has already started racking up award wins and deservedly so.",1263513600,2,3241,4.434563758389261

He could have been making phone calls, playing X-Box, drinking a bottle of Jack, brushing his teeth, staring aimlessly out a window, running through Bagdad,shooting people standing around who happen to be holding cellys, doing the laundry for his freinds, getting busy with Israeli chicks, singing 'God Save the Queen' while staring aimlessly out said window, thinking up hilarious 'George Clooney' style pranks to play on the clueless locals, playing soccer and creating lasting friendships with young Iraqi boys selling pirated DVD's...

3861985,5,B00275EGX8,"THE HURT LOCKER is not an easy film to watch, especially for veterans.  It may be about the Iraq War circa 2004, but it is essentially about WAR in general and the devastation created by this most foolish of human games not only on the countrymen of the site of the killing but also on the soldiers from all countries who bond to fight the 'enemy': as Pogo said in a long ago war 'We have met the enemy and he is us'.  Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished the unthinkable - she has created a small, tense, breathless re-enactment of a group of men (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) whose sense of mission and sense of family and disillusion are as fragile as the homemade human and other bombs they render safe. In a minimal but terse script by Mark Boal the words are less important than the expressions on the actors faces, and with a cast as fine as this, those statements are more powerful  than words.

The scene is Baghdad in 2004 and we watch as an EOD specialist Thompson (Guy Pierce), a man for whom the group - namely Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) - has profound respect and love, is blown up in the first minutes of the film.  Thompson is replaced by an obsessed EOD specialist with a record of over 800 bombs rendered safe, one William James (Jeremy Renner) who keeps his mementos of wasted bombs in his 'hurt locker' under his bed.  The film deals with the gradual adjustment of the men to this new, obsessed EOD man as the group faces horrendous encounters with the Iraqis, both adults and children.  There are surprise cameos by David Morse and by Ralph Fiennes, but they don't last long as characters.  What lasts is the interdependency among the men locked into a mission more terrifying than can be imagined.

Jeremy Renner delivers a finely nuanced performance of a man whose adrenaline rush with his job makes him a unique sort of being, yet a man who is capable of the most tender of responses.  Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also superb in roles that in other actors' hands may have become trite.  This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe.  Kathryn Bigelow deserves the Oscar for bringing this stunning event to the screen.

3861986,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker opens with a quote; ""the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" Kathryn Bigelow's film is probably the most acclaimed film of the year, ending up on many critics' top 10 lists, with Roger Ebert going so far as to call it the 2nd best film of the decade. When a film receives such monumental acclaim, it's hard to imagine it living up to expectations and you will find those who have already called The Hurt Locker overrated and disappointing...I was skeptical, I'll admit, but The Hurt Locker delivers.

Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are part of a bomb-defusing squad in Baghdad. In the beautifully filmed, poetic opening scene their sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb goes off. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace him. Sanborn and Eldridge notice immediately that James is more reckless than their previous technician and he has no reservations about it. He's not cocky, but he knows he's good at his job...Even when he's putting both himself and his team in more danger than necessary.

Some familiar faces pop up for brief appearances, actors like David Morse and Ralph Fiennes but the film is owned by Renner and Mackie. The acting in this film has been raved about, but this acclaim has been muffled with more focus being cast on the film as a whole and its female director. This is unfair because both Renner and Mackie carry the film and they both give terrific performances. The acting here is subtle; these are not powerhouse, fishing for an Oscar-type performances. It's the subtlety of the performances, the tapping into real people rather than characters that make these performances great. Renner, especially, nails his role as the adrenaline junkie. Here's an actor that once made Jeffrey Dahmer a sympathetic character and here he really brings you into the mind of James, showing how he thrives on his job rather than just presenting this to you. Both actors breathe so much life into their characters, they rarely let you in on the fact that they are acting...Their performances seem real.

In the film industry, the most celebrated directors are almost unanimously male. Kathryn Bigelow has now made her presence known amongst her male colleagues (notably her ex-husband James Cameron, who has also been celebrating the critical and financial success of a ""small"" film he made), showing that a woman can handle challenging, powerful material that is typically left to male directors. If she were to win the Best Director Academy Award that she will inevitably be nominated for, she will definitely deserve it.

The Hurt Locker works as an action/suspense film and a character study/human drama simultaneously. It's remarkable that Bigelow has managed to balance it out so well, making a film that will appeal to different people for different reasons. Aside from getting into the mind of its main character, it has some intense scenes of heart-racing action; made even more effective by the very real setting...The film was shot in Jordan, at times only three miles from the Iraqi border. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd deserves his share of credit, using frenetic, yet coherent filming techniques that adds to the realism without making the film hard to follow. Not being a Hollywood production, The Hurt Locker benefits even further by not being afraid to enter darker places that would have been ignored and/or glossed-over to conform to Hollywood standards.

I've never been big on war movies, but The Hurt Locker completely exceeded my expectations. It's a great film, easily one of the best of 2009 and it's hard to imagine another film about the Iraq war topping this in scope, entertainment value, or relevance. This film is not just a flash in the pan either and I think that it will continue to gather more acclaim as the years pass. It's a true masterpiece; poetic, exciting, and memorable.

The Hurt Locker might be a masterpiece for some, and seem realistic (if not to those who actually did this job in Iraq: see the low-starred reviews here). But it felt way too slow for me, and disconcertingly unwilling to address anything beyond the minutiae of each defusing event. I never really got much chance to care for any of the characters, though there was some nice ironic humor. Mostly I wanted to be involved beyond the obvious will-it-blow-up tension, yet rarely was.

I sure couldn't wait to see it, and rented the blu-ray the day it came out. It looks good, and Bigelow has a nice eye. But somehow it all felt oddly prosaic. No doubt this is a brutal job, and it's an interesting topic for a film, yet I never felt like I had a chance to get to know anyone here enough to care much about them. Perhaps that's the point?

I was interested by the comments on the one and two star reviews here, and on other boards. Apparently a lot of EOD experts find this film annoyingly innaccurate, while many film fans point to that as unimportant; ""film can take any liberty needed to tell its story"". Agreed, but this sort of film seems married to technical accuracy, indeed prides itself on it, and it felt strange to see so many lives risked, American and Iraqi, by hotshot tactics based on the need for a thrill. Is this what it's really like? Army guys risk each other's lives all the time just to cop a rush? The little speech about that was one of the few times this film really gripped me, much more than the many isn't-this-a-tense-moment scenes, which wore on far too long. They felt overdone and trite, in fact.

One thing that others liked, THL's apparently opjective tone, felt off to me. Yes, this is how these guys do this job (or is it? The EOD reviewers giving this low stars say it ain't, and they might know best). But this job only occurs when we decide to send our troops to other countries, and some of the people there don't want us around. Examining the details of defusing bombs while ignoring the reasons for those bombs being made seems somehow dishonest in a way. You can't separate those details any more than you can separate a cow's role in a hamburger, and completely ignoring why we're in Iraq felt forced and fake in spite of all the attempts to make this seem real.

Maybe that's why this movie is so beloved; it absolves the viewer from thinking about the subtle issues in Iraq, and focuses on the life or death moments, stripped of the entire context for their coming into being. It's much easier for us to see Iraq as a job for our soldiers than ask ourselves: if we really love these soldiers, why are we putting them in the line of death every day, and what have we gained from their sacrifices? Instead we get a film that makes all that seem extraneous.

You're telling me these disposal guys never discuss the reasons for their being there? I don't buy that. I felt more for the innocent Iraqi strapped with a bomb than I did for the guys trying to defuse it. They volunteered for this, and are getting paid for their service; no one made them enlist---the draft is long gone. Whereas the Iraqi is just dying for no reason at all. So who's the hero? One of the basic points of a good war film is that it's not whose side you're on that makes you a good guy; it's whether you are a good person, apart from your country's motives. This was touched on to some degree here, but ignoring all the War On Terror context didn't make sense to me, and made this film feel contrived in many ways.

The low-starred reviews here tend to be from military personnel, and their thoughts are very interesting to read.

Perhaps I need to watch Hurt Locker again. But on first viewing it just didn't grip me the way it did most everyone else. I wish it had! Apocalypse Now and a number of other war films are among my favorite movies, and I was hoping this one would be too. But there's not one character here that I really cared about, one way or the other, compared to my feelings about those films. I appreciated Bigelow's craft, but it didn't move me as it did others. Doesn't mean it ain't a great movie, just that it ain't my idea of a great movie.",1263340800,,4189,4.368421052631579
3861994,2,B00275EGX8,"I wonder what sort of review I would have given ""the Hurt Locker"" had I not spent 11 years in the Army (about half active duty and the other half reserve and the Guard).  I probably would have liked it a lot, but my military experience (which predates the Iraq War but did involve Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq in 1990 and 1991, and Panama in 1989 made the departures from realism (that were invisible to a lot of reviewers here) stand out like blinking neon signs:

1.  I thought the idea of the ""cowboy"" EOD technician sneaking out of the base to go on his own into downtown Baghdad at night in 2004 was laughable, when you think about the fact that I'm sure every soldier over there knows that if they fell into enemy hands, they could expect extremely unpleasant deaths.

2.  Set aside the unrealism in item 1, the fact that the cowboy didn't get in trouble for doing something so outrageously stupid and criminal (since he did force an Iraqi at gunpoint to take him downtown) was also ludicrous.

3.  I will defer to soldiers and Marines who have served over there and especially to EOD technicians, but I found myself extremely dubious that those guys would be out by themselves in such a dangerous environment.  No, they would have had security with them in the form of infantry who would keep watch and protect them while they did their work.

4.  The absence of officers apart from one who gushes about the bravery of the cowboy EOD tech and the psychiatrist who gets himself blown up was unrealistic too.  Those guys would have answered to a captain or a lieutenant, or a warrant officer in real life.

5.  The whole interlude where they were out in the desert with some British mercenaries (or at least that's what I thought they were) was a jarring disconnect given the fact that these guys were EOD techs and not special forces operators.  The fact that they were out there by themselves for a prolonged period made no sense since in real life, they would have been yelling on the radio for a quick reaction force or even support from a helicopter.

6.  I also found myself thinking, ""this is BS"" when the two EOD technicians suddenly became a highly effective sniper team operating a weapon that I would imagine very few service personnel who aren't trained and designated snipers or SF operators would ever see (a Barrett .50 caliber rifle)

""The Hurt Locker"" has some beautiful and striking visuals and there are some scenes with genuine tension like when the cowboy EOD tech discovers that the single IED he's found is only the first stage in a multiple IED set up...but as I said in my review title, these moments of genuine, realistic excitement got overwhelmed by the silly stuff.

Frankly, if you want to see bomb disposal work that looks more realistic to my eyes at least, you should try renting or buying the British series ""Danger UXB.""  That seemed far more realistic than ""the Hurt Locker""

Update:  According to someone who works EOD who made a comment below, EOD teams sometimes use Barrett rifles to blow up devices, so the two guys playing sniper wasn't quite as silly as I thought it was ... but the overall interlude of them out there with the British mercs remained very silly in my view.",1263254400,107,3364,4.7538726333907055
3861995,2,B00275EGX8,"I wanted to like this movie...I really, really did.  I had seen and read alot of hype for it, rave reviews, and alot of talk of Oscars.  After watching it however, I can't see why.

There have been alot of war movies over the years, but there has yet to be anything worthwhile watching for Iraq.  This is not Platoon, the Dirty Dozen, the Battle of the Bulge, it isn't even Inglorious Basterds.  True, other Iraq fair has fallen flat or just plain sucked.  This wasn't as bad (Over There) and didn't have an idiotic and misguided political statement (Redacted...Marc Cuban burn in hell) but it wasn't all that good.

There's the typical military irregularities, such as uniforms (US flags are worn on the right shoulder of soldiers but in the movie they're either on both or none), equipment (magazines disappear and reappear between scenes, and the 6 wheeled APC used by US soldiers is in fact an APC used by the South Africans, not Americans) and overall impossible situations (a single vehicle by itself? REALLY?).  These SERIOUSLY detract from the movie, so anyone not familiar with anything military get a somewhat twisted inaccurate view of operations in country.

The storyline overall really has no point, as all it is are daily missions, almost vignettes, of the EOD team's daily ops.

The last 15 minutes is the only thing that saves this movie and gives it a star.  the acting, emotion and theme (I won't spoil it) would've made this an AMAZING movie, had it been a constant throughout.  Sure, there's small snippets of emotion and feeling, but at times too brief to really feel it.

Yes, I can see this movie receiving some nominations, such as best actor for Jeremy Renner, but to win it I think is a bit much.  As an active duty soldier with over 8 years service and 2 deployments, this movie just seemed lackluster and some of the situations too far fetched to really appreciate the movie, although it wasn't the total crapfest of other movies (Home of the Brave)",1263254400,55,1978,4.679190751445087
3861996,5,B00275EGX8,"Critically hailed since its theatrical release, The Hurt Locker in all honestly would not have attracted much attention from me were it not for the fact that it is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the critically underrated filmmaker who crafted a genre classic with Near Dark, a guilty pleasure action flick with Point Break, and an underrated opus with Strange Days just to name a few.  This time around, Bigelow gives the viewer an inside view of the Iraq war with The Hurt Locker, which details the inner-workings of an Army bomb squad EOD unit, led by the newly transfered Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) and rounded out by Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  What could easily fall under the category of being ""another war movie"" is something that The Hurt Locker is certainly not, as Bigelow puts to use so many great moments of action, suspense, tension, and jaw dropping moments that you cannot help but admire the total package that the film winds up becoming.  Added to that are the performances from all the actors involved, with Renner in particular as the reckless, daredevil, freewheeling adrenaline-junkie soldier whose humanity manages to shine through; this is truly a star-making performance for the actor indeed.  There's cameo roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, Evangeline Lilly, and David Morse as well; rounding out a surprisingly solid cast, but it's Mackie and definitely Renner that steal the show.  All in all, The Hurt Locker is by and far the finest war-related film to see the light of day in some time, and regardless of how you may feel about this particular film genre, missing this film is truly missing out on something special.  Maybe now Kathryn Bigelow will receive the credit and recognition that she has been deserving of all this time.",1263254400,,1805,4.9405940594059405
3861997,3,B00275EGX8,"This movie was good, but comes nowhere near living up to the hype the critics have created for it. If you are expecting a story, then forget it- there is none. This movie is simply a depiction of a series of missions of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. These missions vary greatly in their intensity and interest, and surprise!- some of the missions do not involve bomb disposal at all. With a running time of over 2 hours this film becomes somewhat monotonous, and you will likely be checking your watch to see how much longer you have to go. This movie, contrary to what you may have been led to believe, does not offer anything new or insightful to say about the psychology of soldiers or war's damaging effects. Maybe critics have been tricked into thinking this movie is better than it actually is because the first 20-30 minutes is terrific and gets the adrenaline pumping and I willingly admit to that. But really folks, it's all downhill from there, and at the end I was disappointed that the whole thing never went anywhere.

3861998,4,B00275EGX8,"You can't fault this film's tense, unpredictable atmosphere and the simple, but powerful plot. Nor is there anything wrong with the acting, direction, cinematography or length. But there was one aspect that stuck out like a sore thumb, for me anyway, and that was the portrayal of the main character, played by Jeremy Renner. While he is a fantastic actor and did a great job in this film, I felt his character was one huge clich. I mean, how typical was his persona? Have we not seen this type of hot-shot character before? The macho, I'm-so-brave-and-unconcerned-and-I'm-going-to-ignore-all-the-rules-and commands.... His whole act felt very typical and unrealistic. Clearly, he loved doing what he did, and he knew he was good at it, but again, I couldn't help but feel like I've seen his character a million times before.

I'm usually not a fan of war films, but The Hurt Locker felt different, I think because it concentrated on a certain aspect of the Iraq war, or at least a certain division of it, which it made is slightly more interesting than other war films I've seen. There is not much fighting or battles, just those few tense scenes that have you on the edge of your seat, but it seems enough. For me this movie was more about the character than the Iraq war, and again, that's where my major gripe comes into play. All in all though, I would recommend this film just for its intensity and unpredictability.",1263254400,,1422,4.757085020242915

The Hurt Locker shows the amazing bravery, incredible courage, and borderline insanity that Marines must show on the battlefield.  It does not take sides about the war but rather shows men, soldiers, who were sent to Iraq on a job, and who cannot possibly leave unscarred and unchanged, mentally and physically.

The story is about a bomb squad in Iraq, and you see them in constant danger under such circumstances. The acting is terrific. The story does not have a traditional arc, but that is really not what Hurt Locker is about. It is about the constant danger, over there.

A lot of reviewers here who were there say this was not how it is. I am in no position to argue with them. But for a basic idea of how deadly the Iraq war can be--and for that matter any insurgent war we are now involved in--this is the movie to watch.

3862016,4,B00275EGX8,"""The Hurt Locker"" begins when a U.S. army bomb technician is killed, and he is replaced by Staff Sergeant James, a reckless ex-Ranger for whom ""war is a drug."" He is the anti-hero of Kathryn Bigelow's film, a man so addicted to and absorbed with danger that he recklessly puts at risk his two teammates and cannot even talk to his wife. The man is in fact so narcissistic that he mistakenly identifies a young boy who is killed and turned into a human bomb as a boy he knows, and madly jumps alone into the dark night in search of the boy's killers.

As a psychopath Sergeant James should have gotten his two teammates killed, but somehow he manages to save both. Specialist Eldridge becomes depressed and angry when he fails to shoot dead the man responsible for his sergeant's death. He encourages his psychiatrist to visit the field, and the psychiatrist does, only to be blown away by an IED. On his last mission Eldridge is almost kidnapped by insurgents, but is saved by Sergeant James and Sergeant Sanborn. James shoots Eldridge's foot, ending Eldridge's tour. Eldridge understandably blames James' reckless heroics for his plight, but if Eldridge had stayed in the battlefield he would have probably gone insane. And then there's Sanborn, who as an intelligence officer turned bomb tech support thought he was like James, but James showed him that couldn't possibly be true. In the end, when a bomb almost kills him, Sanborn decides he wants to live, and wants to finally hold a baby son in his hands.

When James is finally holding his baby son with his own hands, James can only tell him that he wasn't meant to raise a family; in fact he was meant to do only one thing. The movie closes with James returning to Iraq, and heading to defuse a bomb by himself.

The movie has received much critical acclaim, and while there's a striking ambiguity and ambivalence to the film that is rare in Hollywood it nevertheless is a shallow and predictable film. There's a lot to commend about the film. The nameless faceless enemy that James and his team battle are everywhere and nowhere, and is an apt representation of the enemy that the Americans are facing in Iraq: against resourceful numerous phantoms the war is to survive, not to win. James is an interesting character, but he's really underdeveloped, and we're supposed to take his complexity at face value when the director works very little to develop his full complexity. The movie's major limitation though is the hackneyed plot lines and story arcs that it follows.

In terms of an artistic documentation of the war as well as a parable into the horrors of war HBO's ""Generation Kill"" is far more appealing. In the 7-part series a platoon of recon Marines is spearheading the invasion of Iraq. They are armed and ready to kill, but there's a splendid innocence to them. They joke around easily, and they share a strong bond that only imminent danger could instill. The stupidity and arrogance of war and its planners soon overwhelm them, and by the end they're fighting and bickering amongst themselves, questioning their very identity as American soldiers. The executive producers were the same team that created ""The Wire,"" and ""Generation Kill"" also had the same raw, gritty feel that made ""The Wire"" so compelling to watch.

Compared with ""Generation Kill"" Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" seems insincere and flawed.",1257724800,,3379,4.798969072164948
3862017,4,B00275EGX8,"I've been a Kathryn Bigelow since Strange Days. I'll admit in a career thats included Point Break and Near Dark, thats not a real good statement, but truthfully thats the first film of hers I saw as a young adult and one that made an impression on me. Now years later and having seen films of hers like the aforementioned ones I can be impressed with this impressive director breaking a mold in the action film market and making some of the best guy movies ever. I had been waiting for The Hurt Locker since hearing about it a couple of years ago. I'll admit I don't watch too many movies on the Iraq war, but with Bigelow in the directors seat and a story that wasn't aiming for a political angle I perked up. I didn't see many movies in theatres this year, but seeing something like this in theatres missing out on Transformers or Wolverine didn't matter that much.
As it is The Hurt Locker is a rather simple story focusing on an EOD's tour that is quickly coming to an end. The first nine minutes sets up what the movie will be with a tense scene where a simple job goes awry when a man steps out of a door holding what might be cell phone. Its an incredibly tense little scene thats topped easily by others.
But more than the scenes the movie is brilliantly about character, two in particular. The first is the main one, William James, a loose cannon maverick who puts himself in harms way knowingly, taking chances and generally putting the other two members of his team in a flux. JT Sanborn is more of a straight arrow who does things by the book because He wants to survive his tour doing his job the way He was trained to. And Owen Eldridge is the younger member of the team quietly suffering from the deaths He's witnessed and seeking therapy from Col. Cambridge.
Thats a basic rundown of the story, three characters surviving a bevy of engagements and the way they interact with each other. While Eldridge is a good character the real meat of the story comes between the conflict between Sanborn and James escalating in a final scenes where both Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie really excelled in my opinion. Better though was a final scene following James at a banal home life, cleaning out his storm drains and grocery shopping with his wife. Theres a small bit of dialogue with Jeremy Renner speaking to infant son that put the movie in some of the same territory as Bigelow's Point Break, only on a more dramatic footing. For this small scene alone I would be suprised if Renner doesn't recieve a large ammount of nominations. Bigelow as well deserves a lot of credit in trying to ground the movie in some sort of reality, building most of the action around suspense instead of simple action- check out the sniper scene, the only gunfight of the movie as the team bonds trading shots with gunmen.
Truthfully the movie is far from perfect with a few scenes that did stretch credibility. I'll admit I'm not a soldier so I won't argue the truth with a few scenes. Then again the film is still a movie and a few scenes are a minor quibble on what is otherwise a great film, well worth your time.
I should add this since I did eventually pick up the Blu-Ray. Sadly the features are the same as the DVD from a good commentary to a very small making of. Picture wise I found the DVD a bit brighter but the Blu Ray does have an incredibly detailed image. While it was darker I would describe it as being more realistic in color and sharpness. I'm not very good about judgement on these things but while it might not astound the picture and audio quality is very well produced.",1257206400,7,3585,4.4169184290030215
3862018,5,B00275EGX8,"Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, one of a scant few women directors in Hollywood, ""The Hurt Locker"" is the best film I've seen so far about the Iraq conflict. Categorized as a ""war thriller"", it centers on an elite US Army EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit and the dangers they encounter as they complete the final weeks of their year-long tour of duty. The film starts with a ""cold open"" (no credits or title card), throwing you right into middle of an IED defusal. We see three men engaging in playful banter while guiding a bomb disposal robot before a snag forces Thompson, the bomb tech (Guy Pearce), to attempt a manually defusal. The situation quickly escalates when Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) spots an insurgent holding a cellphone. Ordered by Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) to ""burn him"", Owen is paralyzed by fear and unable to pull the trigger, resulting in a detonation that kills Thompson.

Top-flight bomb disposal expert Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is sent in as a replacement. Right away on their first mission, the team finds out that he is a reckless and impulsive loose cannon whose blatant disregard for operating procedures puts everyone's lives in danger. Over the course of the film, we see personality clashes develop, sometimes becoming violent, as J.T. and Owen accuse Will of endangering their lives for a high. Over time, however, J.T. comes to respect Will and the work he does. We see Will's intense dedication to his job and self-sacrifice in the face of overwhelming bodily peril.

Ralph Fiennes makes a brief appearance as the leader of a small group of British PMC's, as does a mustachioed David Morse, who is here for a short couple of minute as a loud and boisterous Colonel, mostly for comic effect.

The Hurt locker is a gritty, muscular, and visceral viewing experience. Filmed in a jittery cinema veritee style, we get a sense of immediacy and closeness that few other films employing this technique have been able to match. Where it was nauseating in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;or devoid of warmth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Public-Enemies/dp/B002QEHPR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Public Enemies</a>, it is tastefully and masterfully done here. I was never distracted or taken out of a scene to remark on the camerawork. The style really works here and enhanced the immersion I felt, heightening the tension level and perception of realism. I felt my heart racing in many of the high-tension scenes not knowing what would happen next, not an easy task given how jaded I've become as a result of Hollywood movie-making. Without a doubt, ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the most thrilling and suspenseful military dramas I've seen in a long time. I must also remark on the sound design and music. All of it came together and felt very natural, further adding to the production value and enjoyability of this film. Last, I must warn of some extreme gore, particularly one scene towards the end.

Highly enjoyable and worth watching, especially if you enjoyed urban conflict films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down/dp/B000G0O5N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down</a>. A must-own if you are a war film fan.

3862021,5,B00275EGX8,"I will be the first to say that I am sick and tired of hearing about the war in Iraq. Obviously I don't mean that in the sense that I don't care about the war and think that we, as citizens of a country fighting in this war, shouldn't concern ourselves with it. I mean this in the sense that I am sick and tired of hearing these radical left and right wing media outlets simply bickering back and forth about it. All we hear is how it was a mistake to enter into this war and we should pull out our troops immediately, or on the flip side how it was necessary to enter because we believed they had weapons of mass destruction and we needed to free the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein's reign of terror. It's been over 5 years now'get over it. We are at war in Iraq and there is nothing we can do about it. This is one of the many reasons why The Hurt Locker was such a brilliant film. It is a war movie with absolutely no political agenda behind it whatsoever. It is a brutally honest portrayal of the Iraq War. It isn't about why we are at war. It isn't about why we shouldn't  be at war. It is about being at war'and this war is absolute hell.

  The specific group of soldiers that this film follows is the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) whose job is to, very simply, find and disarm bombs. The biggest thing that makes the Iraq war so much different than any other war, and what this film does a excellent job of portraying, is that these troops aren't fighting a country or a known enemy. They are trying to fight the unstoppable force of terror, and there are no battle lines in this fight. Besides the soldiers wearing a uniform, the troops fighting this war on terror have no idea who their enemy is and isn't. The film makes this clear from the very first scene, where we see Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pierce) walking up to a pile of bombs they have just discovered and that he is attempting to disarm. His fellow commanders, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) frantically look around trying to spot any suspicious onlookers who would could be trying to detonate the bombs. By the time they spot any terrorist it could already be too late. This constant sense of urgency, panic and fear is felt in each scene  as the EOD squad knows that their unknown enemy could strike at any time.

  The movie also acts as a mini character study of Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) for whom this war has become a drug. While disarming the explosives, he almost never shows any sign of fear or panic despite knowing that even the slightest wrong move could kill him. He has become consumed and obsessed by the adrenaline rush he receives with the finding and disarming of each bomb. When this ""drug"" is taken away from him and he is at home with his family, he appears emotionless and empty. There is a great little scene towards the end of the film where he is in a grocery store shopping with his wife and kid and is asked to go pick out a box of cereal. He is then shown standing alone in an aisle staring blankly into dozens of different cereal boxes. He has a look of complete detachment and hopelessness in his face. He has been able to disarm close 900 bombs with complete ease, and now even the simplest task of picking out groceries seems impossible.

  The Hurt Locker is a near perfect film. It is both an uncompromising and brutally realistic look at the hopelessness and paranoia that our troops are facing everyday in Iraq, as well as a poignant and engrossing character study of a man who has become consumed by war. The film's tag line reads ""You'll know when you're in it."" While an audience could never fully understand what it is like to be fighting this war on terror by watching a movie, this comes as close as you can get to a first hand account.

Grade: 9.5/10

3862022,5,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker (Kathryn Bigelow, 2009)

Kathryn Bigelow has been one of my favorite directors for over twenty years now, ever since I first saw Near Dark, which is on my list of the hundred best movies ever made. 1995's Strange Days confirmed that diagnosis, and I'll even admit to her two intervening films, Point Break and Blue Steel, being guilty pleasures. But I am in the minority; Bigelow has never really gotten the attention she deserves from professional critics, in my estimation. Actually, strike that--Kathryn Bigelow's time has come. The Hurt Locker is a movie that has ""Oscar nominations"" written all over it. It is gripping, brilliant, and the best war movie since...well, I've been thinking about that in the days since I saw it, and I'm probably overlooking one or two, but the name that keeps coming to mind when I try to finish that sentence is The Longest Day. (Which, if you don't recall, was made in 1962.)

Warning: the summary paragraph contains a minor (I believe) spoiler that's kind of unavoidable. If you're planning on seeing the film and haven't, skip it.

The Hurt Locker tells the story of an Iraqi bomb disposal unit led by the methodical Matt Thompson (Memento's Guy Pearce). Until, that is, he's killed in the film's opening scene. The army replaces him with William James (28 Weeks Later...'s Jeremy Renner), who is everything Thompson was not, most notably an adrenalin junkie. (Think Vin Diesel in XXX, but with not as good a voice and not nearly the number of toys.) The bulk of the film is a slice-of-life kind of thing about James and his subordinates-cum-partners, Sanborn (Notorious' Anthony Mackie) and Eldredge (An American Crime's Brian Geraghty). I can't remember about what profession it was said that it involves endless stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, but being in a bomb-disposal unit in a war zone? I can't imagine a better definition than that.

And that's what makes The Hurt Locker such a brilliant film; anyone can film a tense scene of someone defusing a bomb and make it tense. Bigelow manages, through James' personality, to make the endless-stretches-of-boredom scenes even more tense than the bomb-disposal scenes. (There's a great example of this about halfway through the movie, when James is defusing a particularly complex car bomb, while Sanborn and Eldredge are keeping watch. The two scenes surrounding it are fraught with tension, while we never have any doubt that James is going to come through the defusing without a scratch. Why? Because he is convinced. And we believe him.) We get a subplot about James making friends with a local kid, a soccer-playing DVD-bootleg-selling roustabout who calls himself Beckham (Christopher Sayegh), and as that unfolds, it's one of the tensest parts of the film. Part of the reason for this is that this isn't really a film about bomb disposal, about war, or about Iraq in general as much as it is a character study of William James--how Iraq changes him, how he changes those around him, and perhaps most importantly, how he changes Iraq. And I'll try to say this in such a way as not to make it a spoiler, but you want impressive? Bigelow does in ten minutes what took Michael Cimino an hour in the third act of The Deer Hunter. And does it, arguably, better.

But all this is secondary, at least while you're sitting in the theater, to the simple fact that while you are watching this movie, you are there, in the heat and the sand. Bigelow shot more than two hundred hours of footage for a hundred-twenty-five-minute film. Obsessive perfectionism? Perhaps, but the success of the result is evident.

I have been lucky enough to see two of the first truly great films of the new millennium this week. One was Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Tokyo Sonata (below). The other is The Hurt Locker. Do what you must to see this, preferably on the big screen. It is a war film, true, but it is so, so much more than that. I have only touched the tip of the iceberg here (I realized just now I forgot to mention a cameo from one of my all-time favorite actors, David Morse); I could go on talking about things that make this movie great all day. If there is a failing in the film, it is in that last ten minutes I mentioned above; doing it better than Cimino still means you're ripping off Cimino, kinda. This is one of those very few times when the ending that was absolutely, positively right--the only ending the film could have had that would keep it true to itself--still felt like it could have been better had Bigelow managed to come up with the ending that was just slightly wrong, but a whole lot more original. Still, that is the most minor of minor quibbles, and let's face it, it's a great ending nonetheless. See it. You won't regret it. **** ",1251331200,3,4775,4.711377245508982
3862023,5,B00275EGX8,"Kathryn Bigelow has fashioned an amazingly gripping and tense film as she takes us inside a bomb disposal team working the mean streets of Baghdad.  It is a wonder how fine film making can still cause a skeptical viewer to suspend disbelief and catch a tangible emotional and physical sense of the unbearable tension and palm-sweating fear of being centerstage amid barely supressed hostility from a local population made up of the friendly, the indifferent and the murderous.  In short, she has created a chair-gripping intensity and her close-in camera work puts us right in the middle of the tension.

Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who imbedded with an actual Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, waste no time getting us into the midst of the tension and action that is an everyday commonplace for these exceptional individuals.  Two surviving members of a team that has lost its leader get a hairy and wary introduction to the style and methods of their new team leader, Sgt. James (Jeremy Renner).  A gifted bomb disposer with a seemingly fearless daring, his teammates Sgt. Sanborn and Spc. Eldridge are more concerned that he is a ""cowboy"" that may increase the danger to themselves, which is already considerable.  They are operating in pure survival mode, while their new boss seems to be in a different, potentially dangerous, mental and emotional zone.

Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James is not an easy read either.  Is his daring approach really recklessness or does he have a more realistic assessment of the danger and the odds?  Is he simply an adrenaline junky that gets off on the fear and pressure, or is he an accomplished professional that has found his calling and his talent and simply realizes that death is always present, and that error is fatal no matter what precautions are taken?  As has been noted by nearly every reviewer, Renner's portrait of this man is subtle and nuanced and brilliantly achieved.  He is nicely complimented by the work of Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldridge).

Likewise, these three young leads are ably supported by Bigelow and Boal, who have created an unsentimental script that wastes no time in preaching or in sidetrips or extraneous scenes that do nothing to illuminate these men and the situation they find themselves in.  With a, thank God, absence of pontificating, moral pronouncements, and political bias, they let the sweaty terror of where these men have to work and what they have to do speak volumes about the ambiguity of this war and any other.  This is nasty business, and the tangible hostility of death arriving from any balcony, around any corner, or in any trap is always readily present and felt.

This is brilliant film making, up close and personal in its execution and allowing a terrific showcase for the young talented actors involved.  Yes, there are cameos by David Morse, Guy Pearce, Ralph Feinnes and Evangeline Lily, but they are just that, cameos.  The bulk of this film rests on the shoulders of Renner, Mackie and Geraghty and they are superb.  I've been a longtime fan of Kathryn Bigelow from her Near Dark debut, through her hits and misses, although even the latter have often demonstrated her energy and chops as an action director.  Here she has married that talent to a fine script written by someone who knows what he's writing about, and the result is a fine film with a subtle subtext and arguably one of the best pictures to emerge from the Iraq war.  It should be seen.",1250985600,3,3483,4.871186440677966
3862024,5,B00275EGX8,"One of the year's best films, this follows a team of GIs in Iraq whose job is to defuse and/or detonate potential bombs. Incredibly taut and scary, particularly when you think about the fact that there are hundreds of soldiers still doing this same job right now.

As a side note - I was on a whale watch this week and started talking with the volunteer naturalist, Jason. He had just come back from two tours in Iraq, doing this exact job. He said that of 198 men in his outfit, 196 had been wounded. (Including himself - 90% deaf in one ear from an IED blast.) He also said that the outfit was now being re-deployed to Afghanistan. I asked him if he has seen 'The Hurt Locker' yet, and he hadn't; but a lot of his comrades had, and they all raved about it. That alone should be enough of an endorsement - see this movie!!!",1250640000,9,824,4.215189873417722

I was going into the movie expecting it to be very political/biased, and therefore making me dislike it (like Jarhead). There were a few moments where you can tell that a writer/director were trying to get their personal opinion across...but that was very minimal...and I'll let you be the judge WHEN YOU SEE IT!!! As a service member, I was really impressed with how they were able to portray the suspense/stress involved in being in those situations.  It's still just a movie, but as far as sitting in a theater, it feels as real as possible.  I'm glad my EOD brethren are getting some notice through this film, they work their butts off, and deserve a little bit of spotlight.

Katherine Bigelow  seems an unlikely choice for the directorial helm of Matt Boal's script for a war-themed independent film, ""The Hurt Locker"" (and the title's unlikely, too).  Boal was last seen penning ""In the Valley of Elah"" , in which he turned a laudable screenplay from a hauntingly true story he had written for Playboy.  I personally think that Boal was arm-wrestled into many of the aspects of the screenplay by powerful director and co-writer Paul Haggis during ""In the Valley"".  That, in fact, might be why Boal sought out someone who was more concerned about seeing the realism of the war in Iraq as it is, and not trying to politicize a story.  The story, simply, is one  of every day Americans confronted by the need to put their lives on the line in a country that is as hellish as the Iraq in 2004, in the wake of our great adventure there.

Hand-held camera shoots in ""The Hurt Locker"" give the gritty, real appearance of Iraq in the film.  Bigelow shot in  Jordan, when she could not overcome obstacles to filming in Kuwait, and the camera scenes can make one weary, in 137 minutes of film, But most of the film is so gripping, and the scenes portrayed do have a tendency to make everyone involved weary, weary of the war.  Bigelow and Boal don't have to preach that war is hell, they just portray it in the realism of the film.  We get it.

The story line involves a 3 person EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit, charged with finding and clearing explosive devices that seemingly litter the landscape in Iraq.  I've done some fiction and non-fiction reading about bomb techs in metropolitan areas in the US, and recognize that the specialty is populated with people who live their lives knowing that the next assignment could cost them those self-same lives.  Not a vocation for the weak at heart.  As the film begins, the trio in the EOD Hummer includes the bomb tech, Sgt. Thompson (Guy Pearce in a good cameo), the driver, Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie, largely unsung before this film),  and the Specialist, who acts as the lookout and the turret gun in the Hummer, Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  The three work well together.

In shocking and violent order, Thompson breathes his last, and is replaced with Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner who was cast as Dahmer early in his career in the film of the same name. Renner has kicked around film and TV since then - he appeared as a lead in ""The Unusuals"" in this TV season, opposite Amber Tamblyn.  It was not renewed.).  As James, Renner has turned in a performance so finally nuanced, that his name will no doubt come up at Oscar time.

Sanborn and Eldridge don't know what to make of the new bomb tech, who is silent and somewhat reckless, a contrast to the confident Thompson, who was a team player.  Over the course of their time with him, you can sense the two of them swinging into his rhythm, learning to anticipate his quirky style and the aplomb with which he's handled 800 explosive devices.  Attribute this to the strong delivery Renner brings to the ""silent cowboy"" type.  The unit has only 39 days left on their tour.

With Eldridge, and to a lesser degree, Sanborn, your sense is that they are waiting on the edges of their chairs for the tour to be over, so that they can escape with their lives and revisit the hellish assignment in dreams.  With James, you get the feel that the 39 days is not enough; that only when he is pursuing his special trade does he feel at one with the world.  There are sidelines to James' story; one in his relationship with a young Iraqi boy, and one in his inability to shoulder his homelife with wife and young son.

Because of their vocation, and because of the reality of the fear in the Iraqi streets, the intensity in this film makes time pass swiftly, absorbs the viewer in the reality.  The actual bombs are stark in their violence, the feel of the streets is that of underlying deception.  There is a scene in the last half of the film where the unit encounters a group of contractors (cameos by Ralph Fiennes and David Morse), that potentially could have come out in editing, but it serves as a contrast of what the different dangers are when EOD units are exposed in the open desert, and not in the city streets.

And ""the hurt locker"" of the title?  It stands for a collection kept by James of items found at the bomb scenes; items that immediately call each scene to mind in the collection of nightmares that he's grown addicted to.  And he is addicted; never doubt that.

Realistic and timely, ""The Hurt Locker"" may be one of the best movies you can see this year.",1249776000,11,4757,4.669867947178871
3862028,4,B00275EGX8,"The Hurt Locker rolls across a gritty wasteland of rocky sand and onto the screen and engages the viewer at once. Visual shots flash out from the point of view (POV) of an autobot, a Humvee and the voluntary, three-man explosive ordinance disposal team. They are there to diffuse a bomb. A sense of danger and an almost palpable tension comes from an intense surveillance of scanning from behind rifle scopes and helmet visors. The editor Bob Murawski (TV series American Gothic) seamlessly fuses the images of the men and the dusty location together in such a way that keeps the action at a contrarily slow but steady anxiety inducing pace. The viewer doesn't know who any one soldier is at this point. Individuals don't matter; the unit matters. Thus Kathryn Bigelow's (Near Dark, Strange Days and Point Break) decision to use talented actors who might not be recognized immediately really works for the film. The team leader suits up. He heads out and about ten minutes later? Kaboom! The first of several explosions comes. In a thunder of death it launches a section of ground in Bagdad 2004 helter skelter. Then it unearths the ground in a dramatic slow motion close up. The film, The Hurt Locker begins.

The title is actually a phrase that journalist/screenwriter heard while embedded with a unit in Iraq, The Hurt Locker.  It is a place of ultimate pain. Being in Iraq in a war isn't what hurts, though at one point one of them says ""If you're in Iraq, you're dead."" No. The soldiers expect the hardships of being stationed in a warzone. Each soldier's locker is opened up and his psychological anguish is revealed as they go through the rigors of living in truly barren surroundings while participating in the OED unit and trying to cope with one another's quirks. Mark Boal's dialogue is sparse, but meaningful and intelligent. There are a couple of predictable or clich scenes such as the interaction with the foreigners they run into in the desert (no spoiler), the ""drunken buddies"" wrestling and the psychiatrist's trip. For the remaining, two hours his script runs by without any jars. He cleverly takes his characters whose goal is completing the rotation alive and pits them against something amazingly simple but complex, time. Every now and then the remaining days stretches across the screen to mark it. When it read ""two days"" the audience let out a tense collective gasp and a sigh.

The Hurt Locker is not in any way a film extolling the virtues of American soldiers abroad. There were only a couple of flags and there was no great adulation of the U.S. or any scenes of Iraqi's expressing obsequious gratitude. In many ways it isn't even a military film. The men are portrayed as men who doing a job. It is also not about military camaraderie. In fact, the men do not really like one another, but they suck up their differences for the sake of the team. It could be any job or sport's team, but the stakes for not following through in this case are high...death.  The three soldiers who, in military tradition, go by their surnames are: Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) and his subordinates Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). It would have been really easy to simply play these roles as stereotypes, but each actor brought the various dimensions of his character to light. They all put in believable performances. Surprisingly Ralph Feinnes turns up in the small role of a foreign contractor Team Leader.

The Hurt Locker is raw and realistic but not raucous. It is very quiet at times due to the intelligent use of music only when necessary. There is an incredible power in silence and film composer Marco Beltrami exploited those moments and respected the images by employing a light touch with the music. There is at least one instance where the moment smacks of the Wild West, and it sounds as though Beltrami may be giving a nod to the Western. For the most part, the music does exactly what it should, it supports the film. There are only one or two instances where it is quite loud, and it should be.

Kathryn Bigelow directs with an almost visible control: juxtapose the young kids' faces with those of the soldiers here; contrast the relaxed residents in loose flowing clothes hanging over balconies with the stressed soldiers in their tight uniforms poised with their guns aimed. The end result is a gorgeous psychological drama told in the fluid flow of shots of the monotone desert splattered with patterns of fatigues, splashes of the occasional turquoise, or pools of blood.  The end result is a wonderfully-told tale of being human and being a soldier in The Hurt Locker.",1249344000,4,4673,4.790322580645161

It feels so real that you will leave the theater thinking you just spent a little over two hours under the Iraq sun, spitting sand out of your teeth. Word of mouth and some great reviews from just about every critic in the country got me to notice this under the radar gem of a film.  There are so many moments of suspense that are built up brilliantly, most of which involving bomb defusion. All of the lead and supporting actors (Ralph Fiennes in a tiny role) are extremely believable, but Jeremy Renner steals the show. This is a star making performance that should be honored with a nomination come Oscar season. I've only seen him on The Unusuals (an average new TV show), but he is capable of much bigger and better things if he sticks to doing movies and roles of this calibur.

The Hurt Locker is one of the better films of 2009 and is easily in my top 5 war flicks ever. It's an honest look, without taking sides or pushing the filmmaker's agenda. One things for sure, no movie about the Iraq war even comes close to this one in terms of realism and I don't expect any will in the near future. When you see it, you'll understand why this one stands alone.",1249084800,12,1213,4.3392070484581495
3862031,5,B00275EGX8,"If THE HURT LOCKER wanted to be a movie with a political agenda or message, it failed for me.  And that's a very, VERY good thing!  While I have not seen every single ""Iraq-themed"" movie made, I've seen enough and read enough to know that the writers and directors just couldn't stop themselves from getting preachy, wedging overtly anti-Bush statements where they didn't fit or, worst of all, implying that all our troops are just crazy maniacs.  In HURT LOCKER, director Kathryn Bigelow knows that she can let a realistic story speak for itself.

And what does it say for itself?  ""War is hell.""  ""War is bad.""  ""War makes good people do stupid things and things they'll regret forever.""  And most interestingly, ""War is a drug.""  If you want to generalize these statements to just the Iraq War, you can.  But it isn't too hard to understand the very specific, Iraq-based events of HURT LOCKER could be extrapolated to any war.  The technology has changed incredibly...but not the basic emotions.

I though THE HURT LOCKER was simply a great war movie.  And I'm grateful for it.  It shows the ugly side of Iraq.  But it also shows some of the reasons we're there.  It shows troops doing horrible things...but also heroic, selfless things.  It shows how troops can fall apart and hurt innocents...but also how they can pull together at great risk to take out the bad guys and save the ""good"" guys.  But more than that, it is a fascinating ride along with 3 very special members of a bomb disposal unit.

Is there anything more tense than the scene where the bomb expert is trying to disarm the bomb before it kills him?  How many movies have we seen that in?  And it almost always works to get the blood racing and to move rear-ends to the edges of seats.  Imagine that scene, done REALLY well, about 6 or 8 times in one movie!  There are almost no moments in this film in which the tension lets up.

Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner) comes to Bravo unit's bomb disposal group after their previous expert met an untimely end.  He is the veteran of over 800 disposals, and when it comes to disarming bombs...he does what he feels he must.  Protocol be damned, and often, his own safety.  He's reckless, yet experience has given him an instinct for the work.  He drives his teammates crazy with fear or angry for his disobedience...but again and again, he proves he knows what he's doing.  He is addicted to the rush of thrusting himself into danger that most normal men would simply wet themselves over.  He can't help it.

Working with him is Sgt. Sandborn (Anthony Mackie).  He's the guy who clears the scene, and leads the efforts to watch for terrorists while the bombs are being disarmed.  Because these devices are NOT just ticking timebombs.  In many cases, the terrorist with the trigger is nearby, waiting to set it off with a flip of a switch or the dialing of a cell phone.  Sandborn and his closest assistant, Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are accustomed to running the show, looking out for the bombers, and shooting them when needed.  James has no patience for their carefulness...he seems to assume everyone is working on the same accelerated schedule he is.

Naturally, this causes tension in the men...which only adds to the natural tension of the disarmings.  Almost every moment these men share together is fraught with tension...and it's all very believable.  Bigelow has some great technical know-how, but she demonstrates it in her camera-work, editing and pacing in such a way to ADD to the story, not distract from it.  Every trick she breaks out is in service to the story.  Her job is to leave you wrung out at the end of the film.  And to leave you reluctantly admiring the cocky, perhaps borderline insane James, along with his more ""normal"" but also very brave cohorts.

The ""war is hell"" message is never overt...it's just there in all the things these soldiers must endure.  About midway through the film is a lengthy sequence during which the 3 Americans and a small group of Brits take fire from the enemy and are forced to hunker down in a very insecure hillside.  The scene is tense, riveting and yet also shows the incredible stretches of just simply WAITING for something to happen.  Imagine the boredom you would feel if you had so sit outside and wait all day for your mailman to arrive.  Now imagine that it's incredibly hot, you are not allowed to move a muscle and instead of the mailman, it's a sharpshooter who wants to kill you.  How can the nerves stand hour after hour of fear?

The three leads in the film are outstanding.  I suspect there's a good chance Jeremy Renner will get an Oscar nomination.  His character is full of quirks and ticks and flashy behavior, but Renner never pushes his performance on bit beyond what the demands of his character are.  It's also a very charismatic performance, and should help turn this solid character actor (28 WEEKS LATER, ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES, NORTH COUNTRY) into a star.  Geraghty is very sympathetic as the conflicted Eldridge and Mackie is a great mixture of hardass and human.

Bigelow (the wonderful STRANGE DAYS) does almost everything right in this film.  I only balked at the distracting ""cameos.""  It felt a bit jarring to suddenly encounter actors like Ralph Fiennes or David Morse, although both are very good.  Worst of all was the sudden, jarring arrival of Evangeline Lilly (""Lost"").  I was just so surprised to see a familiar TV face in this film that I was completely pulled out of the film for a moment.  These are minor speedbumps, though, along a very solid (if dusty and brown) road.

THE HURT LOCKER is the kind of film the all-too-common tag ""must see"" should be applied to.  I was riveted and stirred by almost every minute.",1248652800,7,5750,4.661691542288557

Unfortunatly you don't get sucked into the movie as much as you should.  It comes across a little like the TV show ""COPS"".

3862033,4,B00275EGX8,"As I watched this powerful drama about a bomb squad set in Iraq 2004, I kept wishing that someone could strap Bush and Cheney into some seats and make them watch what their pre-emptive war does to human beings. The basic drama (it's not a documentary) follows three members of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, whose specialization is to find and defuse the infamous ""improvised explosive devices."" They find these devices under piles of trash, in human bodies, in the trunk of a car, and in the Green Zone. But there's a larger drama at work here, as we watch how three very different soldiers cope in very different ways with this job, and what it does to each of their psyches. In this sense, the film is far more personal than political. The film does an especially good job of showing how difficult it is in Iraq to distinguish between friend and foe. The Iraqis watching the soldiers from their balconies and minarets feel as ominous as the bombs themselves. The Hurt Locker was filmed mainly in Jordan and has received uniformly rave reviews.",1247961600,,1052,4.691891891891892
3862034,5,B00275EGX8,"Without any intentions of comparison - because, really there are none - one of my favorite exchanges from any militarily oriented movie is found in G. I. Jane when Demi Moore's character is questioned about her motivations to continue struggle through SEAL training and she responds by asking how males in the program answer the same question, with the answer being ""Cause I get to blow (expletive, naturally) up.""  In this movie, Jeremy Renner in the role of Sgt. William James antes up by placing his very existence into the mix. In fact his portrayal is so intense and the movie itself so engrossing that I really didn't get the title until I sat down to write this review.

This is a movie where one of those perfunctory reviews I detest stating something like ""It's fantastic, just go see it,"" take on heightened significance because I am convinced forays at analysis suffused with superlatives and accolades are paradoxically a disservice to anyone who might find the film appealing.  That said, if it is action, suspense and examination of the human condition that compels one to the theater, it is a film not to be missed regardless of the challenges of finding a screen featuring this lightly publicized, under distributed gem.

If you liked Hamburger Hill or Blackhawk Down, you will be captivated by The Hurt Locker. It is a film with an agenda but unlike other film depictions of the Iraqi conflict it is about the military personnel mired in the conflagration, politicized perceptions and issues of justification are left for others to debate. There are a few marquee and above the title names but their extremely limited contributions are supplemental to the exemplary performances of the three major characters, portrayed by Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty and as previously noted, Jeremy Renner.  From the opening sequence, director Kathryn Bigelow puts the viewer in the roller coast money seats and doesn't let up on the throttle for next two hours.  Utilizing single camera technique, she puts you in the line of fire enduring environmental stresses in the face of sniper attack, inside an under- armored Humvee traveling across IED mined streets or peering out the mask of a bomb disposal technician's inadequately protective helmet, hoping to survive to the day military command has advised you are entitled breath regularly again, if your autonomic systems still remember.

Are there stereotypical presentations, story arcs you've seen often enough to know the outcome from the instance of recognition, of course. Yet, with the intensity of scenes and poignancy of message, the visceral reaction tells you those deficiencies or flaws are of little consequence. If like me, you consider yourself a war film junkie once the dvd becomes available this is the movie that is most likely to be your go to disc whenever an adrenaline injection is the aim of the day.",1247788800,,2880,5.01255230125523
3862035,5,B00275EGX8,"Ever since the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Iraq and its relationship with terrorism has been a hot-button topic. Between the weapons of mass destruction and the constructed civil war, people have questioned the purpose and validity of an Iraq intervention, making the Iraq War, like most others, a largely complex issue. Especially if the war seemingly has the greatest purpose of national security for some, whereas others see the war as useless or a distraction from a greater threat. In any case, the Iraq War has always been something drummed up or put down by its delicate image, constantly thrown in the moral spotlight of good vs. evil. But even with such spotlight, in its sixth year, the Iraq War is something oddly abstract and quickly fading from the public conscious.

The Hurt Locker, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break), is a cross-section of the Iraq War. It is a film that takes the detail of a single bomb squad without centering the plot in some type of moral conundrum. The movie starts in Iraq and ends in Iraq, and for about 99% of the run time, all you see is Iraq and a war with characters acting as real soldiers, as real people. Bigelow's and screenwriter Mark Boal's greatest accomplishment with this film manifests in how determined they are to make a war film that isn't weighed down by fantasy or idealism, but instead authenticity.

Indeed, the film begins with a bomb squad in Iraq that mixes robotics and hand-to-hand techniques for disarming a bomb left in the middle of the street. Everyone in the city appears as a threat and anyone that moves at all out of line becomes a target for suspicion. Hence, within the first moments, there is already a sense of urgency and tension as the bomb diffusing sergeant (played by Guy Pearce) attempts to fix the problem. And well, not everything goes according to plan, and the bomb explodes. But what is so great about this moment is how sensitive Bigelow treats this scene. She focuses slightly on the grandiose nature of the explosion, but then focuses on smaller things--like the jittering rust on a car, and the rattling pebbles in the sand and the seemingly voyeur-esque moments where Iraqis stare at the soldiers from their homes. And as a result, within the first moments of the film, the audience knows that Bigelow's focus is not exaggeration; instead she wants to explore the smaller moments within the war-zone.

Which is why it makes sense that the movie feels like episodic moments with the bomb squad rather than a continuous overarching plot. The Sergeant who dies in the explosion is replaced by a ""wild-man,"" Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who is more comfortable diffusing bombs than his predecessor. He leads his team that consists of Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) in a series of bomb diffusing situations. But while the film doesn't have an overarching bad guy (thankfully), the script does progress as a tour-in-the-life of the three soldiers as the bond through their shared experiences. Yet, never do they have a great catharsis of friendship or disdain--instead their relationship grows as much as it can within the petri-dish-confines of war.

No doubt, character development in the film is almost perfect. Not only does Bigelow and Shoal depict the three soldiers with succinct storytelling, they also manage to touch base on the different attitudes soldiers have about war. James is the team-leading anti-hero who finds the adrenaline of war satisfying--more so than most things in life, which is excellently portrayed in the final moments of the film when he returns briefly to his home and stands in the endless sea of cereal boxes in the grocery store, looking completely burdened by the banality of his ""ordinary"" life. Sanborn is a middle ground between the other two soldiers. He is not a proponent of war nor complete afraid of his duty. He is understanding of the task at hand and does not stray away from his role on the team. And then there is Eldridge, the presumably youngin' who is afraid to die but nonetheless is fighting in a war. Yet, even with Eldridge's fear and anxiety about battle, his character never becomes completely overwhelmed with the fear to where drama surrounds him completely.

Not only does Bigelow create believable and balanced characters, she also depicts a seemingly indifferent Iraq, which comes as a result to her non-existent political tone. There is both camaraderie between some soldiers and Iraqis whereas there is also disdain. Similarly, the dialogue is not encumbered with American propaganda for freedom or liberty or whatever while at the same time does not have Iraqis demonizing Americans as cruel people. Most of the feelings about Americans within Iraq come through visuals; Bigelow lets the camera do the talking and instead of overthetop and overt speeches--the bare-naked piercing stare of several Iraqis looking at a soldier with a gun is enough to know what is what. For example, one of the greatest instances of how sliced the American perspective and the Iraqi perspective can be in this war occurs when a man walks into the middle of a street with a bomb attached to him. William James attempts to diffuse the bomb, but it goes sour, and so the bomb explodes with James in a close distance being propelled to the ground. As he looks up, dazed from the blast, he sees a kite flying, and notes a kid nearby flying the kite.

While there really is no contest on films about the Iraq War, the Hurt Locker stands as one of the best films of the year and probably of the decade. And no doubt, it should be added to the cannon of great American war films. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Shoal have captured war without the moral bells and whistles. This film has a grand showcase of little moments, of rippling sand, of running goats, of children's laughter, of how boring and tiring and frightening war can be. Of course the legitimacy of the Iraq War can be argued probably forever, yet what goes on there is both trash and treasure for soldiers serving duty.",1247788800,2,6113,4.850574712643678
3862036,4,B00275EGX8,"The first 20 minutes were taut, well acted and, overall, fantastic. Unfortunately, I had to enjoy much of the remainder of the movie with my eyes closed, due to the camerawork. The movie was filmed, documentary-style, with hand-held cameras. You'd be hard-pressed to find a steady outdoor scene in the entire film, that didn't play tug-of-war with your equilibrium. Not the best friend of anyone susceptible to motion sickness, like me.

I was so incredibly queasy that I couldn't even get up to leave the theater (like I did during the Blair Witch Project), though I noticed at least 5 or 6 others did. I stayed throughout the entire film, *listening* to a movie I paid $12 to *see*, occasionally sneaking a peak, to see what was going on.

I understand the quality of filming this way - it makes the audience feel like they're *there* and it's becoming a common trait in many new movies. But for an action movie,  it's asking a little too much of your motion sensory in my opinion.

As for the story, itself:

The movie wasn't quite what I was expecting, and that's a good thing. I thought it was just going to be another war movie, but it was so much more. Had a little bit of Jarhead, Platoon and Blown Away tastefully &  intelligently woven into its fabric. Had quite a few laughs, as well.

+1 for the Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and David Morse *cameos*. Honestly, these guys can bring respectability to any film, though it was nice that their screen time was limited. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty drove this film and deserve every ounce of the accolades it will receive.

+1 For the movie not trying to spur any political debates. I felt that this movie steered clear of the good guy and bad guy designations.

+1 For military EOD units finally getting some recognition.",1247443200,4,1796,4.622641509433962
3862037,5,B00275EGX8,"Honestly this really should be my number 1 pick, but I have a soft spot for Star Trek. I should also state that I'm not a big fan of war movies especially modern ones but, this movie satisfied. Hurt Locker is suspenseful, action packed, and at times a little humorous. The acting is top notch, Jeremy Renner does a great job and, fits the role perfectly. The special effects rival big budget movies. The cinematography really works its sort of a cross between 28 Days later and, Cloverfield. The movie was lengthy but didn't drag. It also stays away from the whole ""should we be there"" issue(I'm personally sick of the media trying to tell me how to think.)

My only real complaint in this movie was the ending. It seemed like the writer hit a wall and, tried to slap the ending together. This doesn't spoil the entire movie, and I'd still highly recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 15. Its worth the[...], if its playing near you go see it.",1247356800,,952,4.44
3862038,5,B00275EGX8,"The movie opens with the quote - ""the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug""  (a modern paraphrase of Churchill's older and more famous maxim - ""there is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at without result"")

This is a thriller of a movie about a U.S. Army bomb disposal unit in Iraq and their daily grind in dealing with the IEDs and insurgents there.

This movie does have several stars - but Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly all have fairly small roles.  Blink, and you'll miss them.  Their presence in this movie is more a testament to director/producer Kathryn Bigelow's status in the entertainment industry than anything else.

Jeremy Renner is Sergeant James, a bomb tech.  Unlike his affable predecessor, he is a wild man.  He seems not only indifferent to the dangers of his job, he absolutely revels in the dangers.  It is the ultimate in thrill seeking behavior, getting that dopamine surge in his brain.  Near the end of the movie, Sgt. James gets accused of being an adrenaline junkie, but we know now that the neurochemical at work here is dopamine.  Bomb disposal is not just a job for him, but his passion, his addiction, his reason for being in the Army.

Renner's character ends up like a cross between Elmer Fudd, with his perpetually placid and slightly befuddled gaze, and Bugs Bunny, with his wile and lust for excitement and danger.

His two partners in the unit, Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, who have to cover him and just want to survive their tour of duty, don't know quite how to deal with his determination to confront danger.  One wonders at why Sgt. James puts himself in danger, why he takes the extra risks to defuse a bomb when detonating it would do.  The scene that explains it all is when Sgt. James returns home to America one day and we see him doing the mundane chores of life as a civilian, cleaning out the rain gutters, cleaning up the kitchen, shopping with his wife and baby at the grocery store.  As he stares at an entire wall full of colorful cereal boxes stacked along a grocery store aisle,  a look of utter blankness, boredom, and despair fills his face.....nope, not for him, this dull life as a civilian....

The movie's storyline is a series of daily missions, almost like a documentary or a TV series, each episode standing alone and yet building upon previous episodes, each one presenting a new danger, a new challenge, another piece of the puzzle that is the war in Iraq.

What makes this movie work is the recreation of Iraq in this movie - it was filmed in Jordan with local Iraqi expatriates.  We feel the oppressive tension of the whole country, of not knowing who the bad guys are and where the next bomb or bullet is going to come  from.  We feel the fear and uncertainty of the American soldiers, caught between their desire to be the good guys and wanting to make nice with the local Iraqis,  while constantly needing to remain vigilant and suspicious,  never knowing who is a good Iraqi, and who deserves to get shot.  We feel the bewilderment and resentment of the local Iraqis, who get pushed around at every turn by the American soldiers.

Unlike so many other recent Iraq war movies, this movie makes no political statements, there is no right or wrong here.  These are just men at work, doing a dangerous and dirty job, and these guys are darn good at what they do for their country, whatever the reasons are that they are doing it.",1245974400,273,3470,4.563812600969305
3862039,5,B00275EGX8,"I wasn't familiar with director Kathryn Bigelow's work prior to watching Hurt Locker (she directed Point Break, K-19, and others), but I am now a convert.  She directed a brilliant and visceral Iraq war movie, which unlike many of its peers, is also apolitical.  It's not overly preachy (In the Valley of Elah or Stop Loss) or pure action (The Kingdom), but manages to strike its own ground.  The scenes are gritty, shaky;  thankfully the shaky cam/documentary style footage is tastefully done here.  The movie was filmed on location in Jordan, lending to the film's authenticity and immersivity.  The viewer can almost taste the dust in the air, and feel the stares from the unwelcoming populace.  It's the first mainstream movie to highlight the work of bomb defusal technicians , and it's a thankless and extremely hazardous job.  The movie is Black Hawk Down good, albeit on a more intimate level.

The movie follows three members of Bravo Company's Explosive Ordanance Disposal (EOD) squad, as they struggle to finish the last few days of their year long tour of duty.  Everyone copes differently; Specialist Eldridge (Geraghty) is overwhelmed at times with the death that surrounds them, Staff Sergeant James (Renner) is addicted to the rush of battle, and Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie) supports James as best he can.  James is a complex, fascinating and tragic character; he's extremely competent, yet eccentric and even reckless to the point where his teammates consider fragging him in order to make it back alive.  In a thoughtful gesture, he respects the work of his adversaries and keeps all the trigger mechanisms of bombs he has defused in the past.  Every engagement the soldiers experience until their departure affects them, and we see every emotional impact.

Big Hollywood names like Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, and David Morse make short, but memorable appearances.  Even LOST actress Evangelline Lily has an extended cameo as James' wife.  The bomb defusal scenes are nerve-wracklingly tense, and the audience sweats alongside the defusing technician.  The team constantly scans for snipers, or the suspicious civilian about to make a cell phone call to trigger an IED.  The movie does an excellent job of communicating the hazards of the EOD job, and one leaves with a deep appreciation of their work.

8354073,3,B00275EGX8,"First let me count the number of real military units that get insulted in this movie - pretty much every US Army and Navy EOD team in existence, the infantry teams assigned to protect them, the British SAS, the Iraqi's, etc.  Yes, this movie gets pretty much everything wrong for entertainment's sake - and makes it look so convincing that it becomes an insult rather than just entertainment.  At least the Expendables is right up front with the cartoon stuff - so it remains entertaining, not insulting.

I can't say I know everything that went on in-country, but this movie masquerades itself as almost a kind of documentary.  However, I never saw nor heard of any EOD team that wasn't attached to a battalion command or something similar.  This movie tries to make it look the other way around - like EOD was in charge of something or operating out there on their own.  EOD always supports infantry and lacks the capabilities necessary for operating alone in a combat area.  They don't just ""jump in an unarmored humvee"" and go save the day totally on their own while other combat-proven and professional infantry soldiers are cowering behind a wall.

I would love to know how James even made it to rank like SFC.  I'm sure there were better candidates to promote given his behavior.  Especially since guys like Sfc James were always under the tight control and command of the combat teams within their AO and subject to their review - not to mention they were some of the most highly sought after and scare resources in theater.  So perhaps his promotions came from commanders recognizing the need for the EOD skillset, while looking to promote him out of their theater to eliminate him as 'their' problem...

Either way, EOD didn't go outside the wire without a hefty combat escort.  Yet Renner's character was somehow tolerated while placing himself and others in dangerous situations every time they went out.  I'm sure their superiors gave them lots of latitude with regards to controlling the actual disposal of specific ordinance - since it's what they are trained for... However, there's no way this guy would have been allowed to go all Rambo and maverick like this and requiring more combat support due to his operational mistakes - it's likely that he would have been relieved or pulled off-duty and investigated, or at the least gotten sent home and not returned.

Unfortunately, this movie looks realistic enough to make an uninformed civilian think that the US Army (or Navy EOD) would actually allow this unprofessional and insubordinate goon to routinely act like this.  Not to mention the big middle finger the producers have given to the extremely brave guys from Hereford (and using a talent like Ralph Fiennes to do it, mind you).  Note for the uninformed - the entire so-called ""sniper scene"" was really quite stupidly stupid stuff on so many levels - starting with its inclusion in the movie - why were they even there, and why insult the SAS by portraying them like that?  Just out of the blue, they are alone in a HumVee prancing around the desert...  And furthermore - no EOD team from any country is going to out-fight, out-eff, or out-drink any group of former SAS members turned Professional Merc, trust me on this one - I don't care who they are...

Anyway, AFAIK, just working the work and making 89D (EOD Specialist) can be fraught with challenges because there are certain times where you are not given second chances on tests and qualifications, or even with your behavior while in the program. As I said - not an expert here in US Army policy and such, but I know that in other EOD training workups, you can be classified as ""dangerous"" and disqualified from all programs (forever) just for doing stupid little stuff during training.  These guys do NOT eff around and they take their jobs very seriously.

89D Specialists are some very brave, self-sacrificing group who deserve to have their story told in a responsible way.  EOD is not a game, and some of our best people have died in the line of duty  Few EOD professionals escape without some close call, and it's likely that every single one has lost at least one or two people very close to them.  This movie is a court jester yanking himself and effing off -- perhaps entertaining the masses with his tomfoolery -- but not anything like the proud and brave souls within the EOD community.  It's an insult, not a testament - and for that reason alone it NEVER deserved an Oscar.

This is a piece of trash...  As long as you understand that, please be entertained...",1527984000,2,4557,4.71969696969697

Viewers follow a 3-man explosive ordnance disposal squad in charge of defusing explosive devices during the Iraq War. At the beginning of the movie, the subtitles count down a 38-day mission in Baghdad that seems to last forever as the squad loses its first team leader (played by Guy Pearce), then struggles to adjust to his brash replacement, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner). The end of the movie starts counting down a 365-day mission, which James apparently hopes will last forever.

The movie leaves one with deep respect for real EOD technicians, some who have pointed out factual errors and exaggerations in the movie, especially regarding the cavalier attitude toward safety that never occurs in the field. I cant begin to understand the technical content, but I and all viewers have encountered the Sergeant James personality in our own worlds (e.g. some surgeons in the medical field I know). Journalist and screenwriter Mark Boal (who spent 2 weeks with a bomb squad in Iraq) and Director Kathryn Bigelow handle James character deftly. Just as James is looking predictably overpowering, he is suddenly the support person to Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) who picks off snipers in an all-day mission. James infuriates Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) with shoot-from-the-hip behavior that is frightening to watch. But as is true in other settings, James invulnerability drives the success of the team by invoking anger instead of full appreciation of the life-threatening risks they face.

In an abrupt cut to his mundane life back home, James looks overwhelmed for the first time while standing in front of long shelves of breakfast cereal in a grocery store. The viewers drop in adrenaline during this scene almost makes us understand what James is thinking. I missed this movie in the theaters and watched it now only to be informed.
