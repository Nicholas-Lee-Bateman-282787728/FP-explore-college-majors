2625039,3,B000H0M43Y,"This is a funny little show, and if you've ever seen Wegman's work before you know what to expect: anthropomorphic dogs, in this case preparing for the holidays.

It does get a little long and repetitive, and kids might not hang with it to the end for that reason.",1296432000,,264,4.387755102040816
2625040,5,B000H0M43Y,"I was only about four or five years old when I first saw this movie, and the Alphabet Soup one, and I absolutely loved them. I loved the dogs and the fun things they did gettign ready for Christmas. When I found it on DVD, I had to buy it. I watched it again and cannot believe how hilarious it is! The whole story and the activities that the dogs do are so absurd and outright creepy, but I can't stop laughing everytime the narrator speaks. I've showed to all my friends and they agree that it is a rediculously entertaining movie and a very short time commitment.",1294358400,3,566,4.25
2625041,5,B000H0M43Y,I first saw this video in high school. Loved it then: love it now. I watch it with my five year old. He loves the craft ideas and to tell me he knows where grapes come from (from France!). I love the creativity and the humor.,1292112000,,225,3.9130434782608696
2625042,4,B000H0M43Y,Had this video on vhs - it was so popular with my family that I had to buy it on DVD.  Great video for dog lovers and Wegman fans.,1262995200,,130,3.4827586206896552
2625043,5,B000H0M43Y,"I think this DVD is geared toward kids, but I'm no kid and I find it to be just about the funniest thing I've ever seen. I'm laughing now just thinking about it. I watched it in August, and laughed the whole way through.",1252627200,9,220,4.0227272727272725

2625045,5,B000H0M43Y,"My husband, my two daughters and I began watching this video (first on VHS and then DVD) many years ago on Christmas Eve.  The first time we watched it we thought it was really funny and the following Christmas Eve my daughters asked to again watch it on Christmas Eve before going to bed.  Ever since then it has been a tradition.  My girls are now grown (ages 22 and 25) and they still request on Christmas Eve that we watch it together as a family.  Every year we laugh just as hard at how silly it is! We appreciate Wegman's humor and his beautiful dogs.",1220659200,10,558,4.235849056603773
2625046,3,B000H0M43Y,"I really wanted to like this DVD, but it's just too slow and boring. I have forced myself and my 2 and a half year old daughter to watch this multiple times and we love the dogs, but the whole thing is almost creepy. The narrator's voice is monotone and the script/storyline is odd. My daughter, who will sit through anything with animals in it, gets bored and walks away. I would save my money or buy 101 Dalmations (the animated one).",1214265600,,436,4.329268292682927
2625047,5,B000H0M43Y,"Caught this on HBO recently, and I am going to purchase it for my neighbor's little boy.  Very cute, has elements of ""educational"" content in it (while making Christmas cookies, the different shapes are highlighted).

Adults will appreciate the hilarity of the dogs dressed as people and their obliviousness to what they are supposed to be doing (according to the script). About 25 minutes long.",1186790400,9,395,5.061538461538461

8135654,5,B000H0M43Y,"Our 2-year-old nephew loves this, and we do too. It's a Holiday tradition. There's a fair amount of dry humor for the adults in the room.",1455148800,,137,4.3076923076923075
8135655,5,B000H0M43Y,Bought this to replace our VHS tape.  Christmas tradition to watch it every year with my daughter (who is now 18).  We love it!,1451520000,,127,4.25

8135658,5,B000H0M43Y,"Enter the wonderful and demented mind of William Wegman and his crew of Weimaraners. The Faye Family gets together to celebrate the days leading up to Christmas, with amusing and sometimes downright hysterical results. I had to play this video endlessly for my children around the holidays, and happened to recently see the disc. I surprised my college-age kids with it and although they rolled their eyes about it, we all watched it together with much silliness and glee. Our favorite line, which we all shout out is ""The ones they made!""

Hopefully, it will bring your family as many years of fun.",1398384000,3,599,4.815533980582524
8135659,5,B000H0M43Y,We love this movie! Our two year olds enjoyed the dogs and I enjoyed the dry humor and silliness. A great addition to our Christmas movie rotation!,1391731200,,147,4.481481481481482
8135660,5,B000H0M43Y,"I love Wegman Weimaraners--pictures, videos, calendars, you name it.  Since I got my ANISE SPIRIT also known as the ""Moody Blue"", I have been hooked.  Thanks",1387152000,,157,5.0
8135661,1,B000H0M43Y,"We decided to watch this DVD because we are a multi-generational household with of dog lovers. We also saw that the film has a 4  star rating on Amazon.com. Frankly, I don't get it! This film was slow and inconsistent. In the description it is recommended for a viewing audience of ages 3 and up. It ""may"" capture the brief attention of an 18 month to 2 year old child, but I doubt even they would sit through the entire, very long, 24 minutes. The dogs in it were a bit creepy. I've never seen multiple dogs with no ""life spark"" in their eyes. Plus, the director edited human hands onto the dogs. Weird! I, who grew up in a time with only 2 channels of black and white television, wouldn't have even cared for it a child back then. One disturbing scene in the film was when the dog licked the moving beaters of a mixer as s/he was making frosting. We immediately cautioned my 4 year old granddaughter that that is an extremely dangerous thing to do and she must never try it. I try to find at least smidgen of value in everything I read or watch, but was unable to find anything worthy in this film.",1354492800,,1100,4.238095238095238
