This DVD does NOT have picture for almost all of the songs (only one song have movie to go with it).  All it has is the lyrics showing on screen while the song is singing.  It claims this feature will ""help kids learn spelling"". I find it is much less fun to play with and I do not like it at all.  If you like this feature, then buy it.  Otherwise, please do not.",1123372800,5,461,3.8617021276595747
