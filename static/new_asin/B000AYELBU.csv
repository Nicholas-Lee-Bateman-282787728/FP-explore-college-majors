2398112,4,B000AYELBU,The workout is target specific which I like. Otherwise I didn't see any new workouts that are not in other pilates DVDs.,1274400000,,120,4.5
2398113,5,B000AYELBU,"Excellent for beginners, or for those who are ""out of shape."" Not difficult to do and easy on the body.
The used DVDs were in excellent condition and came in a timely manner.",1247616000,,174,4.303030303030303
2398114,4,B000AYELBU,"This DVD features two Pilates practices.  Unfortunately, they seemed to be geared to different levels, and the second is much better overall.

The first workout is Lower Body Pilates by instructor Jillian Hessel. She begins by going through a brief review of posture principles, and then the workout itself starts with some nice foot and leg stretches while lying on your back. Next, Jillian moves into some of the traditional Pilates mat exercises, focusing mainly on moves that work the legs, such as leg circles and bicycle. Some non-traditional mat exercises are included, such as opening and closing the legs in a straddle position. Jillian also performs the Pilates side kick series, including exercises that focus on both the outer and the inner thighs; there are also a few movements performed lying face down to work the back of the legs. The workout ends with a short standing balance segment, coming in at just under 29 minutes. Overall, this workout wasn't very challenging, but it might work for those who enjoyed thighs segment from Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates and/or who are looking for a lower body workout that is not very strenuous.

The second workout, Pilates Abs, is led by Ana Caban, and it is one of her most challenging workouts. It consists entirely of matwork and begins immediately with the hundred exercise. Ana then moves through a traditional matwork sequence, including moves such as the roll-up, the roll-over, rolling like a ball, the series of five, and the teaser. For many of the moves, Ana adds a more challenging twist--eg, performing several of the series of five exercises with no arms, doing the open-legged rocker with closed legs as well, etc. Because this is an abs-focused workout, the Pilates side kick series and back extension moves are not included. Ana ends the workout with a unique combination move which is a compilation of rolling like a ball, open-legged rocker, the teaser, and lowering down a rope; she then ends with a few brief stretches to bring the workout in at just under 24 minutes. Although Ana works out with an assistant, Tara, who shows modifications for some of the movements, this is an intermediate Pilates workout and should not be attempted by those new to Pilates.

Unless you are already familiar with both of the workouts included on this DVD, I would recommend purchasing them separately according to which one would best meet your needs.",1191196800,15,2417,4.931203931203931
2398115,5,B000AYELBU,It's a great workout.  I'd recommend it to people with at least a little bit of pilates experience.  Try Ana Caban's beginner DVD if you don't have any experience.,1190332800,,163,4.586206896551724
2398116,5,B000AYELBU,This will get the job done. I do the exercises regularly and still wake up sore every morning. Hurts so good and you'll notice yourself looker leaner and standing taller.,1183852800,6,170,4.7
2398117,4,B000AYELBU,The Ab workout with Ana Caban is excellent and I would totally give it five stars. The Lower Body workout was a joke to me. I did not understand the point of it at all. The positions were way too easy and did nothing for me. I'd definitley recommend purchasing the lower body workout separately.,1181174400,,295,4.381818181818182
2398118,5,B000AYELBU,"The Abs Workout is amazing! It gives a great challenge to those of us who have been doing Pilates for a while. It is only 25 minutes long and provides a great workout! Ana Cabon performs the exercises in full form while modifications are given if the exercises are too difficult. Anyone with some experience of Pilates could do these exerecises, modify them as needed, and be challenged to become stronger! This DVD alone deserves the 5 stars!

The Lower Body Workout is quite easy, but is nice for a good stretch and/or an ""off"" day. It is more of a beginner's routine. The exercises can be extended to be more challenging with the use of the pause button on your remote control. :)",1179014400,2,683,4.508064516129032
2398119,5,B000AYELBU,"I must admit I cannot do all of the abs moves, but I am happy with the quality of the video, the instructors, and the workout!  It is not for beginners -Ana Caban does not go into a lot of detail- but if you already know the basics, you'll enjoy the fast-paced transitions.

My biggest complaint with other videos is too much talk and not enough exercise - so I love this one!",1139529600,12,376,4.136986301369863
8080911,5,B000AYELBU,GREAT!!!,1420329600,,8,8.0
8080912,5,B000AYELBU,great product fast service,1407283200,,26,5.75
8080913,1,B000AYELBU,I  emailed the company to tell them I did  get my product.  They stated the tracking stated it was delivered.  If I don't get it what is my recourse.  Very disappointed for a small sum of money.  I just want the product.  So I rate it as bad.  I have purchased numerous books and tapes.  Now a little  disappointed.  To post have to put star.  There should be a No star,1402963200,,369,4.042253521126761
8080914,5,B000AYELBU,"I do Yoga and/or Pilates at least five times per week for anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours. The first day I did this combined workout, I felt muscles that I didn't even know I had! This workout is low impact but it will work every single muscle in your body, I love it! After just a few uses I have noticed a difference. I can't wait to see what happens after one month of use!",1399766400,,380,3.948051948051948
8080915,4,B000AYELBU,"This is a good workout, I try to work Pilates/yoga into my workout at least once a week for my back/stress. And any abs
workout, I'm for it!",1399334400,,140,4.035714285714286
8080916,4,B000AYELBU,"I have done Pilates in the past and enjoyed it as a workout.  This DVD provides a short, but effective workout.  I look forward to using it as a part of my workout routine.  I would recommend it to a beginners of yoga or Pilates, but not to the advanced practitioners.",1397779200,,268,4.215686274509804
8080917,4,B000AYELBU,Everything that I need. It targets the lower abs. It is a perfect workout for beginner to intermediate people. That all!,1378857600,,120,4.761904761904762
8080918,5,B000AYELBU,"I love Pilates and thought both workouts were challenging enough, but at the same time not too strenuous, as Pilates is the workout I do after I have already done cardio and weights.  My favorite body part to work is my abs, and the ab routine is definitely a good strong workout.",1375747200,,280,4.384615384615385
8080919,4,B000AYELBU,"Let me just say that this is not my usual workout. I am an INSANITY and P90X graduate and love all of the beach body programs. However, on rest/stretch days or days where I want to pair something a little lower intensity, I turn to yoga and now Pilates. So far I have tried the ab workout in this box set and I love it. I actually had to take some breaks! As an experienced and frequent exerciser (if that's what you call it), I love this mat workout. Paired with another higher intensity workout like INSANITY and P90X it works great! My abs were really working. I would definitely recommend this!",1354838400,2,598,4.348214285714286
8080920,2,B000AYELBU,"I've done pilates on and off for a few years, and usually feel most suited to ""intermediate"" level exercises. I was looking for some DVDs to have at home for on the go workouts. Unfortunately, this DVD was more of a mix of advanced and beginner, and hasn't hit the sweet spot for a great workout.
The lower body workout is far too easy. While the instructor is very thorough in giving correct form advice, the workout itself feels more like a cool down than something that tones or sculpts. Boredom is more likely than a burn.
By contrast, the abs portion is extremely challenging. Even the easier variations were a real challenge. This can be great at times, but in my case mostly resulting in me lying on the mat, slightly contorted as I tried to recover. My neck usually took a beating, to the point where I simply had to stop lifting my shoulders in order to avoid strain.

I'll probably keep using the ab section of the DVD every now and again, but given the limited exercise time on the DVDs, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",1336867200,,1035,4.4188481675392675
