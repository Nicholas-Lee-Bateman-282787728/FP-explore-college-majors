8348913,4,B0021B4RCI,"When I purchased this item, I knew about potential problems with subtitles. I thought maybe folks were overexaggerating. I have purchased Japanese tv series before so know that there can be problems with subtitles, and it isn't usually because of fake discs or dishonest sellers.  With that said, the subs for this series were ridiculously bad. The very first episode on the disc was wonderful--complete sentences, no mistakes with spelling, Japanese names, then we got to Episode 2 and beyond:  UGH!

The subs switched to Chinese names, which was a problem because within the first episode you don't fully learn everyone's Japanese name, so when they switched to Chinese names it was difficult to know which character was being discussed.  They also dropped words and it was like I was reading a high schooler's text message.  My grammar sucks so I'm not one to really speak, but it became quite an intellectual chore trying to determine what was really being said.  For example, when ""The Prince"" said he was going to his dressing room, subs said, ""I go back.""  I had to wait to see if he had quit his job (which was possible) or if he was saying he was going to be in his room.

The biggest problem I had with this though was the change in meanings: Chinese has different meanings for some of the sayings, so when Kenta, the main character (cutie Ohno Satoshi!) said in the first episode he thought kids are ""pitiful,"" in a later episode when they flashed back to that scene, subtitles had Kenta saying that kids are ""poor.""  It gives a whole different meaning because Kenta was unconsciously referring more to himself and both labels could be applied to himself, but he doesn't care he is poor and because he hasn't gained insight into himself yet, he doesn't recognize that internally he is pitiful (and seriously depressed).  In my opinion, this self-discovery and deciding point on whether he wants to change it, is the point of the whole show. I haven't seen the ending yet, but the theme is throughout the first half.

So, I have finished the first disc.  Have the second disc to go.  I am really hoping that there is some miracle and subs get better.  I try to go back into the main menu after each episode and click on the English subtitles before watching the next episode.  I don't think it really matters, kind of like pushing an elevator button again and again because the elevator is taking a long time, but it makes me feel more hopeful.",1250035200,,2454,4.648148148148148

They say they bought it from here form this exact site, link form here.  It seems real until it get to the credits and I quote "". In the credits it said, ""translated by..."" and then it gave a username.""  So I am assuming that this is an illegal copy/fansubbed.......It should say so in the description, is all I'm saying.",1245024000,2,487,4.388888888888889
