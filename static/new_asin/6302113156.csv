423205,3,6302113156,"I saw this on the Independent Film many years ago, very good film, revolves around Gangs but gangs in the 1940's.
Also a film about Latinos (my people) and the problems they face in the inner city.
It's much better than those terrible soap opera's in Mexico, this film is a musical but it's also a drama focusing on different Hispanic characters.
Edward James Olmos career is synomonus with these type of films
most notable ""American Me"", ""Stand and Deliver"", ""My family""
a great actor who is part of the real population.
Despite the great performances the film does suffer from
its story, you know several hot headed characters with their
attitude and lifestyles are only headed downhill and their
fates are predetermined.
Still ""Zoot Suit"" is a good film.",1088467200,12,757,4.8307692307692305
423206,3,6302113156,"""Zoot Suit"" was fighting and uphill battle for my appreciation. That's because I wanted it to be something else entirely. You see, I love the idea of filming live theatre. Purists and snobs will tell you that you lose something essential by taping a performance. Namely the immediacy of the live show--the audience's involvement, right there in the moment. But, on the other hand, that loss is inevitable and unavoidable. The camera is by its nature a detached observer. But it freezes in time what would otherwise be lost forever, unless of course it is revived. And revived is the perfect term because the work is on the brink of death until dedicated actors, directors and audiences are once again ready to breathe life into the piece. I have immense respect for the stage, but if I ever have the opportunity to write professionally I hope to start with screen or print because those two media are easily preserved. Which brings me at long last to my point, I rented ""Zoot Suit"" because it was close in theme to ""The Capeman"" which I want to see with all my heart. It has been gone from the stage for years, but is preserved in an almost inaccessible archive. ""Zoot Suit"" is here for all to see, and it is most certainly worth a viewing. It is much better than ""West Side Story."" Why is it that a play, which was first and foremost supposed to be an update of ""Romeo and Juliet""  has instead been elevated to being the end-all and be-all portrayal of street-gang life on the American stage? Anyway, rent it, watch it, enjoy it. Keep in mind that all three are separate plays and you will be much more apt to appreciate each in their own right. Just keep your fingers crossed that someone will take a risk and buy the rights to ""The Capeman."" I know I am.",1075593600,2,1757,4.473520249221184

423208,4,6302113156,"This re-telling of the so-called ""zoot suit riots"" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the ""pachucho"" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.

When barrio leader Henry Reyna (Daniel Valdez) and a group of his friends are unjustly convicted on circumstantial evidence and sent to San Quentin, activist lawyers Alice Bloomfield (Tyne Daly) and George Shearer (Charles Aidman) fight the blatant racially motivated miscarriage of justice to win Henry and his friends their freedom.

Featuring Edward James Olmos (as the mythical ""Pachuco"") in the role that catapulted him to stardom, Zoot Suit is a scorchingly searing and seductively provocative work that skillfully blends action, drama, romance and music!

This musical biography flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade when I saw it during its theatrically release in the Fall of 1981 when Ronald Reagan was President and we had all those budget cuts going on, due to the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1393804800,,1065,5.109195402298851

423570,2,6302113156,"Almost everything about this film is a misstep, the first of which is the filmmakers chose to shoot it as a film-within-a-play. Of course, Zoot Suit was indeed a well-received play as far as I known only performed in Los Angeles. But that fact doesn't make it a good or smart idea to treat it as a play for the screen, even though it is not just a play, but also a musical. While most American musicals show staged musical numbers, very few if any show the audience in a theatre (unless the musical theatre is a specific part of the plot).

There is a reason for that: it is jarringly distracting and it detracts from the story and the play itself. It appears that becuase the play employed actors seated in the audience as well as actors going off stage and into the audience several times that the filmmakers chose to include the audience in the film. But what might have been an interesting theatrical trick, popular especially in the era in which the play was performed, is completely irrelevant the film's story and premise: the persecuction of the pachucos in Los Angeles in the late 40s.

Though this fundamental flaw in the film's structure is a major problem, the central problem is the symbolic character, El Pachuco (?), played by Edward James Olmos.  The problem appears to be both with Olmos' characterization as well as the character itself, which is evidently supposed to be the physical embodiment of all the self-hating qualities that the filmmakers claim are a deep, deep part of the psyche of Chicanos in the United States. Now, why on earth would this extremely negative, arguably untrue, archtype be of use in a work of art is a mystery to me.

Because everything that the Olmos character says turns out to not to be true for the lead, the hero that, except for the musical numbers, is the only one that can see this Pachuco character. So, what this choice to put this symbol into such prominance might be the main reason for the film's failure at the box office. And this problem is further emphasized by Olmos' hammy over-the-top evil-villian performance and makeup. I thought I was looking at Snidely Whiplash the characiture of the silent film villian who tied the damsel in distress on the railroad tracks (complete with the pencil thin moustache).

Though it was ""interesting"" to see that Olmos' once had a 6-pack and that he can actually sing (though it may have been dubbed, I doubt it after looking at the footage and close ups and keeping in the mind that Olmos was in the play-musical and would have had to do his own singing then), his choices to ramp up the crazy is again, just mystifying.  You want to portray the psyche of an entire people as prideful and hateful? Why?

This structural problem completely undermines the true injustices visited on the zoot suiters portrayed in the film. It is impossible to  be suitably (pun intended) outraged by the corrept rulings of the judge when you have Olmos whispering in the hero's ear that he is stupid for expecting justice. An audience needs to be shocked by injustice, not forewarned that it is there and there is never any reason for hope that there will be.

The romantic sequences are a further irrelevant distraction, especially the ones with Tyne Daly, who due to her extensive TV work after this was shot, now appears to be more of a 2-diminsional cut out than a real character.

The filmmakers were confused when they made this film, trying for musical numbers, romantic love, political statement, psychological editioralizing......it's unfocused, it's sloppy, but most of all it isn't interesting or perhaps even worth it to see a dissertatoin on a certain group's inborn self-hate.",1393372800,,3675,4.728125

From that standpoint, this project doesn't work for me. I found the presentation distracting. I'd rather see a version adapted for film, or the live stage production.

That aside, the story of the ""Zoot Suit Riots"" is an interesting and important event in American history. Most people associate the Zoot suit with African American swing bands, not realizing the history of the suit. Watching this project motivated me to read more about this incident. There's so much American history that is overlooked in our school textbooks!

It does this while revealing an historical event and how it is indicative of the unequal justice of the past and present for non-whites and those not fitting the social norms set by white society.  It is truly worth seeing but I have had to explain the Edward James Olmos character to several people.  He is voice in Henry Reyna's head, the image of what a Zoot Suiter was seen as, narrator of the story, and a few other things all put together.

423722,2,6302113156,"This movie's best feature is that it is a perfect ""opening up"" of a play, just enough to be cinematically compelling, but never leaving the stage behind.  It was done so well that the artfulness of the storytelling almost made me forget about the evasiveness of the story being told.  I kept looking for reasons to like this, until the cop out ending made me wonder if there had been a single moment of historic or sociological truth in the previous 100 minutes.

It would have been perfectly sensible to end the story with an honest and factual recitation of the subsequent crimes committed by the men who had been falsely accused and abused by the legal system.  It was perfectly bizarre for Valdez to invent ""let's pretend"" destinies for the defendants, full of success and happiness.  Am I supposed to be amused by this phony rewriting of reality?

The very real evil of American soldiers, journalists and judges is laid bare,  but the evil crimes of Mexican-American gang members are self-righteously minimized and sidestepped.  In its trivializing of gang violence this play/film is a perfect illustration of the phoniness of Mexican-American pride.  The Big Message is that double-talk and rationalizations of violence within ""Chicano"" communities is perfectly acceptable, so long as you can point your finger at systemic Establishment (read ""White"") racism.  I guess that's the true nature of El Pachuco, then and now:  swaggering BS.

With some self-reflective honesty this could have been a worthwhile phantasmagoria of fashion, music, ethnicity, crime and injustice.  Instead Valdez squandered his talents on dishonest propaganda.",1217376000,5,1641,5.193916349809886
423723,5,6302113156,"I believe that if you are born Mexican in the US, you should receive -- along with your ""Brown Club"" membership packet, a complimentary copy of this film. The film is sublime and any stylistic errors that Luis Valdez MIGHT have committed would certainly be ameliorated by the penetrating and unswerving look into Mexican American psychology. This is Octavio Paz's ""Labyrinth of Solitude"" put to music. Every time I see this film, I am awed and nearly moved to tears by its heroic, yet tragic, beauty (this is a bit embarrassing when I have to turn on the lights and discuss it with my students, but that's another story). Every image, every word, has been calculated to stimulate thought and introspection. Even the most hardened, nihilistic people I've shown this to have come away from watching it with the same reaction, which is something along the lines of ""this film is bad a**.""

In short, this movie is revelatory and relevant to anyone who wants to know about this historical psychology of the Mexican American. Our past, our worldview, is not better than anyone else's, but it surely isn't worse -- and it does not merit be expunged from this nation's history.

423727,3,6302113156,"Zoot Suit takes a highly stylised approach to racism in the 40s, in particular the infamous 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder trial that saw a group of Zoot Suited `Chicanos' railroaded for a murder in one of the most outrageously unfair trials in American history. But rather than go for a grim courtroom drama, Luis Valdez' film uses it as the basis for a musical fantasy about racism and machismo dominated by Edward James Olmos' El Pachuco, a fantasy figure acting as both Greek Chorus and instigator, with attitude and bad advice to spare. The director's brother Daniel Valdez does double-duty as self-destructive leading man and composer of many the songs, and does a good job of both (sadly the soundtrack only made it to LP). There are some liberties with the truth - names have been changed and the 22 accused are whittled down to a fictionalized four for dramatic convenience - although the most surreal and unbelievable aspects of the trial are sadly accurate: the defendants weren't allowed clean clothes or haircuts to ensure that they looked more `criminal,' had to stand whenever their name was mentioned and the prosecution really did produce a witness from the LA Sheriff's Office who gave testimony that Mexicans were predisposed to commit murder because of their `Aztec heritage' of human sacrifice.

There's no attempt to hide that this is unashamedly a filmed play and there are problems with the approach: the sporadic cutaways to the theatre audience are more distraction than anything else and by filming on the original theatre sets the film occasionally hits problems with the cinematography - the vivid colors are excellent, but the tendency to lose focus on anyone not standing center-stage (something that happens to Charles Aidman in particular) is irritatingly sloppy. Also, it has to be said, Olmos' performance makes no concessions to the more intimate nature of film and at times comes across as stilted and too mannered for the big screen. Yet despite the niggles, it works more often than not. Not for all tastes, certainly, but this `Chicano Chicago' certainly deserves to be better known.

Universal's DVD is bare-bones - only the atrocious trailer in badly bleached-out black-and-white is included as an extra - but at least boasts a good widescreen transfer.",1182038400,11,2290,5.03957783641161
