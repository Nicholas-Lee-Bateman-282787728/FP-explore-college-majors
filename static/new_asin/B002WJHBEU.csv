4007077,3,B002WJHBEU,"""Urgh!"" on DVD... Well, actually it's a DVD-R, that they seem to churn out when someone orders one. The main advantage offered by the studio here is that you don't have to rewind the videocassette. WB has revealed that they simply don't care if it's not a sure bet. Absolutely disgusting treatment of a classic. Yes, I will concede, the picture and audio are the best ever offered for this film, and while that is of course the main concern, this film is an archive of such an important time for many fans... This is a missed opportunity. The artwork is horrible, considering the original soundtrack package. It's a shame when film companies drop the ball like this, ""lose the plot"" as my English friends say...

This should have been a special edition with a documentary about the film, a commentary, and original artwork. Even a modest budget could have created a classic here. Look to the Downtown 81, TV Party, and Wild Style DVDs. Likely could have become a staple for young curious types from Silverlake to Williamsburg to Berlin... Maybe it still will (and it should!), but any message of historical relevance and respect for the material is nearly lost with that lame cover art and lack of reverence for the original film's scenes/breaks.",1264377600,37,1246,4.768518518518518
4007078,5,B002WJHBEU,"This official DVD (NTSC, 16:9 anamorphic, Dolby 2.0 stereo, single layer DVD-R) release of URGH is almost everything I could have hoped for.

I've been a huge fan since I saw Urgh in its limited cinema season in Brisbane circa 1981. I immediately bonded with artists like The Cramps, Klaus Nomi, Skafish, Fleshtones, X, Au Pairs, Alley Cats, GoGo's, Joan Jett and Pere Ubu - bands I may not have known otherwise. I was already a devotee of Devo, Wall Of Voodoo, Dead Kennedys, XTC and Gang Of Four. I also came to appreciate just how damned good the Police were (the ultimate rock 3 piece). I bought the LaserDisc and was happy enough with that for the next 20 years - even though it had lots of video noise, was only mono and did not include Wall Of Voodoo (one of the film's highlights). I also bought the 2 disc vinyl LP, so I knew the soundtrack ought to have been in glorious stereo.

Comments on the 2 ""unofficial"" DVD versions of Urgh:

Until this Warner Archive release, there was the distinct expectation that the best anyone could have expected to own was an unofficial DVD-R copy of a transfer made from damaged videotape (which was itself transferred from less than perfect film). I bought two different ""unofficial"" DVD versions - the dodgy ""Urgh..."" version was absolutely terrible in both video and audio quality - with lots of errors, including a full 11 seconds missing from the start of the Fleshtones. The ""Anti..."" version was from a much better source tape, with just a few video glitches, but it was still quite blurry and with about 14 noticeable and annoying audio glitches (including a full second missing near the start of the Dead Kennedys). Both versions have the audio annoyingly out of synchronisation throughout, by about a tenth of a second ahead of the video - with Pere Ubu and Devo both a glaringly obvious third of a second ahead of the video. ""Anti..."" had done his best to enhance the look of the video and had applied loudness and compression to the audio (which is OK at low listening levels, but grates at high volume). Both these versions were 4:3 fullscreen and in stereo.

Comment specific to this Warner Archive DVD version:

The video and audio quality are both fantastic. It is truly astonishing to note the amount of extra detail discernable as compared to all previous versions - and it makes a very real difference to the enjoyment of the music.  Most of the time we're viewing virtually from the mosh pit - and at such close range nothing on stage should be blurry. You can clearly read the rude message that Stewart Copeland has scrawled on the heads of his toms.

Synchronisation is absolutely perfect throughout and examination of the 24fps progressive scan video proves that the transfer has been made from pristine or very carefully restored film. The original film frame has been cropped to 16:9 anamorphic, offering more detail left and right of what was visible in the 4:3 fullscreen versions, and the whole film works perfectly in widescreen (as you'll witness on a big widescreen TV).

The only technical errors are a split second of distracting introductory vocal which remains at the start of the Jools Holland song (it should just start with a piano note), and that the last couple of seconds of audio is repeated for both Devo and Gang Of Four (where I suspect there was a change of film reel). Warner have chosen to leave out the British band ""Splodgeness Abounds"" with their punk restyling of ""Two Little Boys"" (a soppy sixties hit by Australian Rolf Harris) - they must have thought that bit of English humour would be wasted on Americans. There are so many people in Splodgeness that they take up a big slice of the onscreen credits and they should have remained included, especially because they fitted perfectly forming a bridge between Skafish and UB40.

The audio is very dynamic and sounds increasingly better and more powerful the louder you crank it  - and this movie is meant to be enjoyed very loud.

The Warner Archives DVD is a single layer Dolby 2.0 stereo disc, which isn't in itself a problem - because I can't imagine it looking or sounding much better as a dual layer PCM stereo disc. However a quibbling point is that it doesn't have a ""scene selection menu"" or even chapter marks for each song - just one every ten minutes. It would have been good manners to include a track list on the DVD cover or as an insert, so that people who are not already Urgh fans might know which bands and songs to expect, and in what order.  However it's the sort of film that I've always been inclined to watch from start to finish anyway.

Warner are probably just playing it overly safe regarding DVD-R compatibility with the warning on the lower back of the packaging. It plays perfectly in my PC, my DVD recorder and other players.

The fact that this version has been able to exist - with such good quality video and audio - offers slim hope that a perfectly edited and fully featured complete official version is still possible. But that will only happen if the owners of the distribution rights see the potential for sufficient profit.

Undoubtedly a five star film, and even in this ""bare bones"" DVD format it's still a very good 4 star product.",1262736000,20,5222,4.636363636363637
4007079,4,B002WJHBEU,"This is a long-overdue DVD.  An amazing sampler of the great bands of the 1980's Punk / New Wave scene.  This is a must have if you are, or were ever into these types of bands.  Unfortunately the DVD production is very disappointing.  There is no menu for song selection and there aren't even chapter marks at the beginning of each track.  Only chapter marks every 10 minutes that don't necessarily fall at the beginning of the songs.  Warner Brothers could have done a much better job...",1260835200,8,488,4.551724137931035
4007080,4,B002WJHBEU,They have finally released this fantastic move on dvd after many years of waiting. If you ever wanted a real taste of the Punk Rock movement in the 70's and 80's look no further. This movie gathers the best bands for that time in music and gives you an inside look into the culture for that time with just music and no words. There have been many other movies about this music but none can come this close to getting it right by just letting the performances speak for themselves. This is the best of the best get this now!!!!!!,1260835200,2,528,4.29

It was a great price, picture quality was perfect, but agree that it did need a better menu and you should be able to skip right to the next band, not 10 minutes ahead.  Other than that, I love it.  A must have for any of us that grew up in the 80's or those who want to see a real history of music in that era.",1456012800,,376,3.617283950617284
4007083,4,B002WJHBEU,"I used to watch this when it first came out obsessively from my bedroom in the small farming town in which I grew up. It was one of the few links to punk rock & the new wave we had. The Cramps came to a city within 100 miles from my home & I convinced my brother to drive me to their show, my first concert ever. Although Kid Congo had replaced Julien, it was a life altering experience & confirmed my love of them from watching this so often prior to seeing them live. They were just one example of being introduced to new bands/sounds that began with this movie. So watching it this many years later it was interesting to see which bands still held that power when viewed through 50 yr old eyes rather than through teen eyes. There are enough solid & powerful moments in here that make this a worthwhile investment. I even enjoyed watching those bands I thought were horrible at the time (and still think are awful, but entertaining/watchable nontheless) like Chelsea, Members, Invisible Sex but the majority hold up great & still are great to see perform live, particularly considering this may be the only document available that captures them at that time or at all. XTC, Wall of Voodoo, Magazine, Au Pairs, Echo & The Bunnymen, Gang of 4, X, Dead Kennedys, John Cooper Clarke, the list goes on. Solid performances, still great- particularly considering even bands I'm kind of apathetic towards are captured at such an early stage they still had some power & freshness- like The Police & Go-Go's. It's unfortunate not all the bands from the soundtrack made it to the film- I think The Fall were one of those on the double lp but regrettably not on film. They must have footage of all the bands & it would be great to see an extended cut come out with all them. The only fault I found treat hung it after so many years is that i wish there were less cuts to the crowd DURING performances.  It was funny/entertaining to see the fashions/behavior etc, but after the first few times it became annoying. This is another gem in my collection of video documents of specific bands/labels & even though it contains more pop/commercial bands than Drag City or Forced Exposure & similar independent vids, it's as valid and enjoyable. Definitely worth it even if you like a small percentage of the bands appearing.",1452988800,10,2307,4.545673076923077
4007084,5,B002WJHBEU,"A must have for any punk rocker young or old. Trust me, this movie ROCKS!",1448582400,,73,3.933333333333333
4007085,5,B002WJHBEU,"I cannot add much to the numerous, mostly excellent reviews already posted, only that I really didn't expect this level of picture quality on a 2h VHS-to-DVD5 transfer. But guess what; it's taken from the master tapes ! And I don't know whether or not someone stated these are ALL live performances, not videoclips as I had assumed, and incredibly well filmed to boot. Most of these 36 clips I hadn't seen anywhere else, and I thought I'd seen it all.

So I'll concentrate on some of the most technical aspects of this release instead.

The fact that the label didn't care to track it clip by clip -when any moron with a PC could have- is in fact indicative of disinterest on the part of the label. The variable pic bitrate varies from clip to clip, going from 2-7 Mbps. Even well below the 3Mbps crap zonethe picture holds up better than it had rights to, fantastically I may add. Artifacting is almost absent.

The sound is 2.0 but jaw-dropping. It has loads of accurate bottom end, so much so most of the time I found myself turning the sub down. Stereo imaging is also precisely achieved, no imbalances whatsoever.

The poor menu and authoring, and the fact this should have been a dual-layer DVD would normally make me knock down at least 1-2 stars from the 5-stars rating I gave this, but the quality is so astonishing I simply had to keep it at 5.

As in every comp, I skipped some of the clips I wasn't interested in, but that is expected with so many artists to choose from. A great, comprehensive  live overview of the early 80s punk/new wave scene at both sides of the pond. Highly recommended.",1446854400,,1605,4.47945205479452
4007086,4,B002WJHBEU,"While the DVD is nice and clear (instead of the fuzzy picture from a bootleg I own),the only complaint I would say is that each segment does not have a chapter. That would have been better to have each act as its own chapter",1437523200,2,224,4.113636363636363

4007088,5,B002WJHBEU,"I had this brilliant music DVD recommended to me from a well known Australian music guru, a few years back , that gave me a copy of his. I immediately purchased it through Amazon. It is an amazing documentation and a very powerful music legacy to the great raw shows by individual bands from a great era featuring the most popular groups on the New Wave scene. The film also features several less famous acts. A fabulous look at what was a great scene in the music world. I highly recommend this DVD and it has to be played loud to feel the intensity.",1433980800,2,551,4.3076923076923075
4007089,5,B002WJHBEU,"I saw The Police and XTC in concert in Minneapolis during the tour of 1980-1981 when this film was being made. Miles Copeland, Stewart Copeland's brother of The Police, was involved in the making of this film. It's an interesting slice of a short lived but relevant era in music. This time in the punk/new wave music was when the U.S. scene was bohemian and avant-garde to a large degree. Just before the scene divided into factions, hardcore vs everything else.",1433980800,2,462,4.716049382716049

4007098,5,B002WJHBEU,"Bought this on album when it first came out, because I was able to see many of these acts back in the day in NYC and Philly. Years ago when I saw it was on VHS I had to grab it, the tape was out-of-print by then and going for big $$$ (was supposedly released on LaserDisc as well). The film had limited theatrical release, but has shown up on TV from time to time. Now it's on a Widescreen DVD and a no-brainer purchase, historical essential stuff. Many of the acts featured were managed by POLICE drummer Stewart Copeland's brother Miles, of I.R.S. Records fame, and many recorded for that label as well. I've always wondered if there were FULL sets of all the performers recorded, the rumor is each band had three songs each filmed.  Would make a great limited edition set, eh? Considering what a licensing nightmare this must be, we're luck to have it at all (unless Miles Copland gets all the $$$ anyhow). Here's the track/performer/song rundown, with the album the original recording can be found on afterwards for those of you that might want to dig deeper. I've also added ten links (the limit) to albums I feel are essential for a collection. Those marked (*) are on the double-album/cassette version.

You'll be pleased to see good footage of bands you loved but have since forgotten.

This is not one concert, but a mix of great one-number-each, on-stage performances by many of the most outrageous and greatest bands of the time. There are, as I said, a few bands/artists who I don't care for and feel should have been replaced by better bands, but we all have different taste, which is what new wave was all about in the first place, a variety of styles and a willingness to experiment with new influences, instruments and mixes of styles.

Professionally filmed with no chit-chat, just one song after another. No other documentary of the time or the early new-wave scene captures so much of the feel of the time so well. I recommend it highly!!!!",1379462400,2,1159,4.676470588235294

4007116,5,B002WJHBEU,"""Urgh! A Music War"" was the soundtrack to my college days at UCLA, circa 1980, when punk, new wave, ska, and reggae were having a powerful impact on the pop charts. Music in the 1970s had become so stale that musicians and their fans went looking for something more compelling. They found it.

Taken from a number of different concert venues in the US and Europe, including stages in Los Angeles, San Diego, New York, London, Portsmouth, and Frejus, France, this important film presents a wide-ranging, fast-paced, two-hour cornucopia of enduring creativity. The Police both open and wrap up the proceedings -- not surprising since the film's producer was Ian Copeland, brother of Police drummer Stewart Copeland.

Included are 36 complete performances by 33 groundbreaking artists, including Echo and The Bunnymen, Jools Holland, The Go-Go's, Dead Kennedys, Pere Ubu, Gang of Four, and many less famous bands. Some of my favorite songs are high-energy numbers by the likes of Wall of Voodoo, Chelsea, Oingo Boingo, XTC, Steel Pulse, Joan Jett, Devo, X, and UB40. A few acts have not aged well, like the frustratingly static Gary Numan, the robotic cross of mime and opera that was Klaus Nomi, and the spastic sexual dysfunction of The Cramps' lead singer Lux Interior. But even weird, off-putting performers can be interesting.

Both picture and sound are very good. A two-minute trailer is the only special feature. There's a very brief comic bit featuring the Surf Punks, many shots of fans slam-dancing and crowd-surfing, and clips of kids strolling the streets in fashions of the day: mohawks and pink hair, studded leather and skinny ties. But there are no introductions, interviews, or other bonus features, just live music played with passion. Turn it up to 11!

What have been nice to see Stewart Copeland or one of the directors give a 10 min documentary on the making of the film. Still I'm happy to see it clearly instead of watching my bootleg and worn out VHS copy that was so grainy.

4007132,5,B002WJHBEU,"FINALLY - we get ""Urgh! A Music War"" on DVD (albeit, press-to-order DVD-R from Warner Brothers Archive).  If you are not familiar with this movie, and are an aficionado of late 70's/early 80's New Wave and Post-Punk music, you need to get this DVD immediately.  Like many fans of the film, we all had beat-up VHS copies dating from the 80's (my personal copy was recorded off USA Network's ""Night Flight"" back in the mid-80's) , and I have to say the transfer and sound here are very good, especially considering that WB Archives really doesn't usually put a ton of work into the Archives series (in order to keep costs down).  Barring a full blown remix/remaster release, this DVD-R should satisfy most fans (I watched it in a 100"" screen and the picture looked very good/no grain/few artifacts; sound was crisp stereo).

Put simply, this film is a nearly 2 hour compilation of live performances by both well-known and obscure bands of the early 80's New Wave/Post Punk genres.  It was produced by Miles and Ian Copeland (brothers of Police drummer Stewart Copeland), who were pivotal music industry figures, with Miles' label IRS and Ian's artist management/booking career.  Lots of skinny ties, synthesizers, off-beat acts here in this film, and everyone was very young when this was made.  The best-known groups here getting screen time are: The Police (to start and close the film - they get 3 songs), Wall of Voodoo, Oingo Boingo, Echo & the Bunnymen, XTC (pre-stage-fright, which ended their touring career prematurely), the GoGo's, Gary Numan, Joan Jett, the Cramps, Devo, Gang of Four, UB40 and X.  For some of these bands, like Chelsea (who I'd never heard of, but were very impressive), Toyah Wilcox, Gang Of Four, Fleshtones, etc., I'd have to think there's really not a lot of footage out there.  The playing here is energetic virtually across-the-board, and goes a long way toward dispelling the notion that the DIY aesthetic of people just picking up instruments and not really knowing how to play them - there are some really good, tight and cohesive performances here, and for the most part, these bands can lay it down convincingly.  Having not seen this film since the early 90's, it was excellent to get a fresh look at it on DVD.  While not the definitive 'final word' on New Wave/Post-Punk (i'm sure everyone will come up with missing bands - i could immediately start with omitted LA/SoCal bands, notwithstanding the presence of a fair amount of LA bands actually in the film, etc.), it accomplishes something in giving a varied survey of key bands and interesting curios.

Here's a list of the performers, in order (owing to WB Archives series discs being indexed in 10 minute increments, there are no artist/track chapter stops, so this will help in determining who is where on the disc):

Police/Wall of Voodoo/ Toyah Wilcox/John Cooper Clarke/Orchestral Manouvers In the Dark/Chelsea/Oingo Boingo/Echo & the Bunnymen/Jools Holland/XTC/ Klaus Nomi/Athletico Spizz 80/GoGo's/Dead Kennedys/Steel Pulse/Gary Numan/Joan Jett/Magazine/Surf Punks/Members/Au Pairs/the Cramps/Invisible Sex/Pere Ubu/Devo/Alley Cats/John Otway/Gang of Four/999/Fleshtones/ X / Skafish/ UB40/The Police (then, a police song performed w/ various other bands at same concert).

Note that Sploogeness Abounds, who appear in the credits, appear to have been cut from the film (possibly either due to footage problems or legal clearances? - they were originally between Skafish and UB40).  The original film was 120 min; this disc is 116 minutes, so it's pretty much intact.",1266710400,53,3569,5.129310344827586

It's not all great and some of the acts don't hold up after 30 years, but almost all of it is pretty amazing.

8383179,5,B002WJHBEU,"After wanting to get my hands on this concert for years, I finally got around to buying a copy of URGH! Having watched it last night, it was well worth the wait. Had this concert been filmed in a single venue, it would be hailed today as the Woodstock of the New Wave/Punk generation.

The performances are almost all excellent and run the gamut from New Wave to Punk to Reggae. Some are a little off the wall (Pere Ubu, John Cooper Clark, Klaus Nomi) and are more performance art than music. Gary Numan rides around in a motorized space-age bumper car (Why did he become so popular on the strength of just one hit single??). I loved seeing the crowd getting all riled up to the Dead Kennedys and Chelsea and I kept worrying that Luxs black leather pants were going to dip below the equator every time he writhed around deep-throating the mic when The Cramps were on.

The Police, Joan Jett and The Go-Gos are probably the most recognizable mainstream acts here. It was fun to see Belinda Carlisle looking so pudgy and their performance of WE GOT THE BEAT sounds grittier than what the single would actually become.

This is the kind of stuff that was being played on CFNY in their early days and it proves that the most creative and innovative period of the 80s was right at the dawn of the decade. One of the best concert movies I have ever seen. Its electrifying, energized and makes me wish I could go back and experience it all over again. FIVE STARS.",1468281600,,1456,4.425373134328358

Years ago when I saw it was on VHS I had to grab it, the tape was out-of-print by then and going for big $$$ (was supposedly released on LaserDisc as well). The film had limited theatrical release, but has shown up on TV from time to time. Now it's on a Widescreen DVD and a no-brainer purchase, historical essential stuff. Many of the acts featured were managed by POLICE drummer Stewart Copeland's brother Miles, of I.R.S. Records fame, and many recorded for that label as well. I've always wondered if there were FULL sets of all the performers recorded, the rumor is each band had three songs each filmed.  Would make a great limited edition set, eh? Considering what a licensing nightmare this must be, we're luck to have it at all (unless Miles Copland gets all the $$$ anyhow). Here's the track/performer/song rundown, with the album the original recording can be found on afterwards for those of you that might want to dig deeper. I've also added ten links (the limit) to albums I feel are essential for a collection. Those marked (*) are on the double-album/cassette version.

8383182,5,B002WJHBEU,"Like many of you, I've been looking for this for decades! And it was worth the wait! I still don't understand what the Music War was all about - a competition to see which performers could bring the most energy to one of three or four venues? If so, everybody won! A few friends had the soundtrack (on vinyl - yeah!) in the early '80's and if not for that I would never have known the Au Pairs - I still have an album. How could this compilation be better? Well, personally I'd like a bit more punk and ska and a bit less New Age. (Although Gary Numan was hilarious in his golf cart or whatever from outer space!) And unfair to have several Police songs and only one Wall of Voodoo! I'd add about four hours and include The Clash, The Ramones, Public Image Ltd., Talking Heads, The Tubes, Richard Hell and The Voidoids, B-52's, Lene Lovich, The Dead Boys, English Beat, New York Dolls, The Jam, The Professionals, Joe Strummer and Los Mescaleros, The Germs, Black Flag, The Motels, and on and on. Maybe the footage exists and a filmmaker of my vintage will create the definitive collection for The Lost Generation. Until then, play this loudly!",1457827200,4,1144,4.4523809523809526
