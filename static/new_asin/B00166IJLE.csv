Tuts Washington was 'fess' mentor and his students included the brilliant Allen Toussaint. The three were going to present a concert together, an historic concert. It just didn't work out that way and I won't tell the full story here.
I have had copies of this video for years and loved to watch it several times each year and show it to new friends as an introduction to what a music documentary should be. Stephenson Palfi the producer and editor won 20+ awards for this documentary. He spend a decade editing it. The stream of consciousness between the interviews of all three pianists is eerie. Palfi was working on the successor to this documentary entitled ""Allen Toussaint, Songwriter Unknown"" when Katrina flooded his studio/home. Palfi tragically committed suicide six months later. Hew was my friend and I may be his biggest fan after Allen Toussaint.
Don't miss this one. It's the best roots music documentary ever made and features one of the few totally original musicians who transformed the world we live in.",1233964800,32,1298,4.877828054298643

8261102,5,B00166IJLE,"Professor Longhair was/is my favorite New Orleans musician. I saw this documentary on PBS probably 20 years ago and have been looking for it ever since (I could not remember the name which was a barrier to my search.)
I saw a reference to it in an Oxford American quarterly magazine on Louisiana musicians and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.
It was even better than I remembered!",1386115200,,382,4.550724637681159
8261103,5,B00166IJLE,"This documentary with three of the greats in the tradition of New Orleans ""piano professors"" is a look into the creative process as they prepare to play a concert that did not happen as planned (buy it if you want to know why - no spoilers here!). Recordings of Tuts Washington are rare, and if only to see and hear him work, the film is worthwhile (I cannot believe how long his fingers were). But there is much more: Allen Toussaint, the writer of more hits than I can name, is seen here as a young man working with two of his idols.  The interaction of student with elders is a look at another era.

The eye opener for me was Professor Longhair.  If you don't know the story, here it is as I have heard it: he started playing in clubs after World War II, and as he said, he had lots of work and very little pay.  He quit playing.  In the early 70's someone recognized him and he was coaxed into playing at the then fledgling New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. At the time the entire festival was held in Congo Square.  Acts almost had to compete with each other to be heard.  Few people knew who he was, so when Longhair started playing there was not much of an audience at his stage.  That quickly changed - he brought the other musicians to a halt as the entire crowd was drawn to where he was.  The legend began ...

Until I saw this film all I knew was the story and the recordings; I never saw him play.  So all I could do was wonder how he worked - his playing is so ""there"" that it sounds as if he just sits down and the music happens.  The film let me see how much there was to his work.  No theorizing, no impossible-to-understand technical talk - just explanations and demonstrations of how to get the sound.  The sound, the rhythm, the doing, and doing it right, were the point.  My whole idea of the man and the music went from some sort of legend to a feeling for his impassioned work.  He was not appreciated, maybe, his first time around, but this was no deterrence.  He knew what he was doing, even if others seemed not to, and he was going to keep doing it until they got it.  ""Get it"" we all did.  So get the film!",1371772800,6,2140,4.138014527845036
