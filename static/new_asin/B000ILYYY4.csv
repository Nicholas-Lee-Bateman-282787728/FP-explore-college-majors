8146218,5,B000ILYYY4,"Fantastic PBS documentary that explores the many types of love.  Camilla Williams, great opera singer, is my reason for making the purchase.  She is shown after her extraordinary operatic career with her recital partner, Borislav Bazala, of many years.  He is from Bulgaria and didn't have the ""hangups, hate and prejudices"" many Americans had before, during and after ""jim crow"".  Their families were extremely close from the '40s through the deaths of their beloved partners.  Camilla's husband died in 1970; however, Boris continnued accompanying her after the death of his wife many years later.  It is a beautiful love story of how they came together from the beginning until now.  I won't tell; you simply have to purchase the film.  But, I will tell you he lives with her and their friendship is of a most pure and innocent nature.

Included are other ""love stories"" just as moving.  Purchase this documentary and find out.",1276300800,,930,4.98051948051948
