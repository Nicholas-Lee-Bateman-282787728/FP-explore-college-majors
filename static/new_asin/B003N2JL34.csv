8400654,2,B003N2JL34,"An arrogant, and somewhat of a bully, captain (John Bromfield) of a boat called the Manfish joins forces with an expatriate Brit (Victor Jory in a rare leading role) to hunt for treasure in the waters off the Jamaican coast. This low budget potboiler is very loosely adapted from two Edgar Allan Poe short stories, THE GOLD BUG and THE TELL TALE HEART. About all it has going for it is the lush and colorful Caribbean scenery as there's no real suspense, the characters are unlikable except for Lon Chaney Jr.'s big hearted but dumb Swede and the performances pretty amateurish. Though filmed in color, it's fallen into the public domain and most prints are in black and white. Directed by W. Lee Wilder. With Barbara Nichols in her film debut (as a brunette) and Tessa Prendergast. A curiosity but that's about it.

The Alpha DVD is a soft looking, over digitized public domain print. Decent on the close ups but rather hazy on the long shots but I've seen worse transfers. And yes, it's the original color transfer.",1316908800,4,1017,4.681564245810056
8400655,2,B003N2JL34,"Does this release actually contain a color version of MANFISH ?  Shown on British TV in the 70s in color, a few DVD releases of this film are usually in b/w.  Amazon product description says it is color.  Anyone bought this yet and can confirm the image of MANFISH.",1304899200,,265,4.36734693877551
