7864559,5,6304153279,"This movie can be purchased reasonably on DVD from AMAZONUK. but you will need a player that plays different regions as this is a REGION 2 dvd.  It doesn`t take a lot of brains to figure this one out, but the presentation and acting are first rate, especially the female lead who has to handle diverse roles.  I`m sure she felt it was an actor`s dream. WELL WOTTH SEEING.  There are a lot of vintage noir movies available from AMAZONUK.",1356566400,,436,4.425
7864560,4,6304153279,"To me this is the film that should have set Susan Shaw on the way to fame and stardom. The film shows, in retrospect, a murder victim and the suspects from different perspectives. Depending on the differing points of view Susan Shaw is either a sweet, caring sister or a shrieking, jealous slut. Dirk Bogarde, with a dodgy accent, plays a bogus American, the characters' duplicity matching his duality. Reflecting the theme of Hamlet and later American Beauty, The Woman in Question is an atmospheric film noir examining the difference between what is and what appears to be. The denoument ( I won't give it away) is very surprising as the true sequence of events is revealed.",1111881600,2,676,4.786324786324786
