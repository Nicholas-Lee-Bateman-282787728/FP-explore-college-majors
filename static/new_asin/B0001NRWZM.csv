8015367,4,B0001NRWZM,"The gun camera footage is taken from Luftwaffe training films for fighter pilots. Each engagement is preceded by information regarding it, but that is the problem. It is all written in German, therefore hard to understand. With a little effort, it seems to me that the company could have produced an insert translating the words, making it more meaningful. The accompanying music is all patriotic German marching music from the war, some with vocals, some without. The action is riveting, but unfortunately each clip is all too short. This is not the fault of the producers of the DVD, since it is all they had to work with. Despite the drawbacks, it is still an excellent product simply because very little axis gun camera footage survived the war.",1079395200,6,749,4.859375
