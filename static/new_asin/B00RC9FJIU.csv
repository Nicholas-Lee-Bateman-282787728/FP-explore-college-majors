6925708,5,B00RC9FJIU,Good film.  Old fashioned scary ghost story.,1426809600,,44,5.285714285714286
6925709,5,B00RC9FJIU,"One of the best indie-horror films of the last decade. At a time when the horror, is at an all time low, a film like this comes along and breathes new life into the genre. Eric Roberts, and Deborah Twiss work great together, and make give us characters that we care about, rather than the typical one dimensional characters, that we often get in horror movies.
But the real star of the movie is the adorable Sydney McCann.  I usually dread, children in horror movies, but she gives the performance of a lifetime, and Im sure this won't be the last time we hear from her.

All in all, I found the movie to be great, and refreshing. And after such high profile disappointments such as ABCs of Death 2, and Zombie World, Im happy to see a film take the genre seriously again.",1426723200,,772,4.354166666666667
6925710,5,B00RC9FJIU,"Finally a ghost movie that's not too far out. Love that it is not carried by expensive special effects like so many other haunted house movies, but rather by a good story telling and acting, that leaves you both on the edge but also with a smile on your lip. Eric Roberts is as Eric Roberts is - solid. Cathy Moriarty is wonderful-mysterious-scary as Alice and Deborah Twiss is just awesome carrying us through the catalog of emotions. Can't say enough about Sydney and Matthew McCann - they are excellent. Could keep going on, but in reality it's way better to experience ""A Cry From Within"" for yourself. Just make sure you check behind doors and in the basement before going to bed after watching it...you never know!",1426723200,7,720,4.6328125
6925711,5,B00RC9FJIU,"I have the DVD and watched it a couple of weeks ago. One of my favorite ghost movies was ""The Changling""; now, this is my favorite ghost/haunting movie. I love the CD cover.",1426723200,,173,4.2727272727272725
6925712,5,B00RC9FJIU,"A CRY FROM WITHIN was so well done and Deborah Twiss put her heart and soul into this film! She created an incredible film with such a wonderfully, talented cast! The story is unique and it is not the average, everyday paranormal, haunting or ghost story. It is a story that shows what a family must overcome when someone else's nightmare effects their lives! The actors did a great job and I am looking forward to many more films from Deborah Twiss! Absolutely exceptional work!!!",1426636800,9,481,4.670588235294118
6925713,5,B00RC9FJIU,"I saw this at the premiere in NYC last week.  I thought it was a good, solid ghost story with great characters.  It was really fun to see Eric Roberts playing a lead role, just a nice guy, good husband involved in a crazy situation.  Cathy Moriarty was incredible.  She's so intense.  Hope both these actors work a lot more, in the right kind of roles, if enough of the right people see this film.  The kids were great too.  Sydney McCann was totally believable and kind of creepy and Matthew McCann was hilarious with his constant one-liners as the comic relief.  James McCaffrey from Rescue Me and MaxPayne was good as the town priest who is caught up in the drama of the haunting and Deborah Twiss (Mrs. Zane in KickAss) was fun as Eric Roberts' wife.  All the acting was good and even though it's not a big budget Hollywood film, it totally appealed to my desire to watch a good story I could get totally invested in.  Totally recommend.",1426636800,,941,4.4186046511627906
6925714,4,B00RC9FJIU,"Beautiful and talented cast.
A big house and an interesting plot.
This is a film with an everyday real family.
Eric Roberts shows he still has what it takes with his fine performance as a caring husband.
Deborah Twiss gives an award winning performance as a caring wife and mother caught up in a horror beyond belief.
Last but not least, Cathy Moriarty plays her role with ease as she makes the audience wonder what she will do next!
The children are masters with their performances as well.
I honestly enjoyed this film.",1494115200,,521,4.612903225806452
6925715,1,B00RC9FJIU,Was anxious for it to end. Giving it one star is definitely overboard!!! May be the worse acting I've ever seen.,1494028800,,112,4.380952380952381

6925717,5,B00RC9FJIU,Touching movie. The ending brought tears to my eyes! :(,1491609600,,55,4.6
6925718,1,B00RC9FJIU,"And the boy cries out ""what's going on?"" which certainly resonated with me as I was thinking the same thing... hey, why have one senseless plot line when you can have half a dozen. A number of washed-up, has-been actors show up in this for some reason but it does no good, they couldn't save it. The main guy is about 65 with 7 to 9 year old kids (usually a Kevin Costner trick) he really should have been their grandfather, they buy a big house, there's a doll (there's always a doll). There's an ugly old troll in a bed who is being spoon fed by an equally ugly old troll (no idea why). There's some old fool having nightmares (no idea why). The little girl, who is too sweet to pull off the creepy kid thing, gets possessed (no idea why)... and some other random stuff, none of which is interesting. My favorite part is when a homeless looking man from AAA turns up to look over the house-I thought they only did cars-and sort of runs away scared. It's full of mysteries like that. Then all of a sudden... nothing happens!",1490659200,5,1025,4.288659793814433

6925720,1,B00RC9FJIU,"I started watching this because I like Eric Roberts and Cathy Moriarty in combination with the old country type house but turned it off immediately after the little girl got super demon strength. Really corny bad directing and terrible shaky camera work. This new generation of filmmakers have no talent in my opinion. I don't know what they teach in film school these days but making a movie with your iPhone is a bad idea! What happened to the true horror of Hell House, The Omen or Amityville?  (original versions of course.) Those were REAL filmmakers! Music and movies suck these days.=(",1487635200,,592,4.803921568627451

6925750,1,B00RC9FJIU,This movie was a jumbled mess at best. The storyline was weak. Deborah Twists boobs were nice but we didn't need to see them at every turn. It takes far too long to get a good idea of the story. Too much work up but not enough follow through.,1483315200,,242,3.9591836734693877

6925756,2,B00RC9FJIU,"No, I'm not a professional movie critic and I'm not an actor. So who am I to criticize this movie so harshly? I'm a 62-year-old woman who has watched thousands of movies over a lifetime and gained a modicum of discernment through the years. I can't carry a tune but I sure as hell know when someone is singing off key. This review isn't meant to denigrate anyone's talent or ability but is my honest and heartfelt opinion based on my life as an avid cinephile.

The actors:

The best performance in this movie was given by Sydney McCann, who played the youngest child, Ariel. She is a natural. I think we'll be seeing more of her in the future.

Matthew McCann who played the son, Morgan, is not an actor. He's just Sydney's big brother who came along for the ride. Do yourself a favor, little man, and go to college, get your MBA and become your little sister's accountant when you grow up.

Eric Roberts' performance as Jonathon, the therapist dad, is so over the top that halfway through the movie I just wanted to take him by the shoulders, shake him and tell him to stop it. I mean, really. His idea of playing a supportive husband and dad is to be sickly sweet and over enthused about EVERYthing. Every word he says feels forced and artificial. C'mon, Eric, I know you can do better. You should stick to type and play creepy or bad guy. Trying to be a goodie two shoes just isn't your bailiwick. And OMG, dude, get a freaking haircut, for Pete's sake. That shaggy look just isn't charming anymore.

Deborah Twiss, the oversexed mom, gave a performance that was tacky and uncomfortable. I've never seen her in anything else. I hope she does better in other venues because this is definitely not her best showing.

Cathy Moriarity, bless her soul, did the best she could with a crap character and amateur script, but even her talent was hidden under this burdensome bushel.

Everyone else was just stilted and awkward and painful to watch.

The movie:

This cumbersome piece of crap is sloppy and disjointed with abrupt, non-sequitur scene changes and monotonous music. The dialogue is boring and the story line is clumsy. Although it tried very hard to be classic, this movie is inelegant and unwieldy. It clumps and limps and drags along until the end credits are like the sweet release of death.

Even the scenery and staging are drab and unimaginative, as well as repetitive and monotonous. That marvelous house has so much potential but ends up being flat and one dimensional. Such a waste.

Overall, ""A Cry From Within"" isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure runs a close second.",1482969600,3,2600,4.581896551724138

It starts off quite ok, gets slow in the middle, but ends with suspense and delivers a good explanation to the mystery. The movie has no gore and is a typical haunted house movie without the overdone digital effects, which most recent haunted house-movies tend to have recently. The slow paste is even welcome and refreshing, though I found myself playing a game on the Ipad after 40 minutes of the movie.

The little girl wakes up at 2am  in the morning and says she's hungry and instead of doing what normal parents would do and that's say go back to sleep and we'll eat in the morning, the mother gets up at 2am and cooks enough eggs and bacon to feed three people and lets the daughter eats spaghetti and the eggs with her bare hands and neither parent says  a word.

And the husband and wife relationship and lines were just as phony, with the husband saying 'baby' at the beginning of every sentence as though the script writer had to work overtime to convince the audience that this was a wonderful loving family.

Cathy Moriarity is perfection and a welcome return to the big screen as a tortured daughter of a domineering mother.  Eric Roberts is as suave and enjoyable as always.  Deborah Twiss can write, direct and act giving this movie a lot of heart.  The children in the film really steal the show.  An entertaining and  suspenseful psychological horror film.",1426809600,,514,4.976470588235294

8694829,3,B00RC9FJIU,"The basic story is fair, though not fully fleshed out.  I have a sneaking suspicion that there was Not a strict drug testing policy on set, as most of the actors, and at times the camera men, seemed to be either stoned or heavily medicated.  This movie is kind of all over the place.  I would not recommend it based on quality, however, the sloppy acting, writing, filming, and directing add a layer of humor.  Also, the disjoined story arcs force you to stay invested just to see what the heck is going on.  I was ever bored while watching.  Watching with a small group of friends, here were plenty of opportunities to make jokes and point t plot holes.  I love a terrible movie that's fun to watch.",1496966400,,700,4.37984496124031
