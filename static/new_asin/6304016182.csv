7859116,5,6304016182,"... but it's one of my favorite Sesame Street videos. This might be in part because most of the shorts hold together pretty well even if your kids are only listening to it and not sitting there with their faces glued to the TV or tablet or whatever. Speaking, you know, of imagination. :-)",1357257600,,289,4.37037037037037
7859117,1,6304016182,"Although the cover states that the video is in Spanish only when the characters speak, yes its in Spanish, but the music, which is more than 50% of the video is in English :/",1349827200,,174,4.147058823529412
7859118,3,6304016182,"I'm watching right now with my 2 year old daughter for the 40th time. For a 28-year old, I'd rather be at the dentist office. However she really enjoys it and she just shouted out the word ""recycle"" so though Sesame Street isn't like when I was a kid, it keeps her busy.",1243468800,,270,4.113207547169812
7859119,5,6304016182,Received item fast and in perfect condition. My nephew broke his last one and wanted a new one. I found it on Amazon.com right away and for a great price. The DVD was shipped immediately and my nephew was thrilled!,1242345600,,214,4.375
7859120,4,6304016182,"Let's just say I'm not a huge fan of the video, but my 2 year old daughter really likes it.  Zoe and Telly headline the show and it's filled with songs and fun.  If your child likes watching other children perform then they will like it.",1235952000,,237,4.130434782608695
7859121,3,6304016182,"Much like ""Kid's Favorite Songs,"" the production values on this tape are pretty poor. The video consists almost entirely of the contrived setup: a sudden rainstorm traps Zoe, Telly, Gabbi and some other kid-actor types inside Finders Keepers (the neighborhood junk store) without any adult supervision. Mumford appears briefly, almost unrecognizable to my two-year-old as he's both out of costume and context. Most of the songs aren't clips, but are sung by the kids in the store.
There is one saving grace to this video: a terrific clip with Ernie singing ""Imagine That,"" the song where he imagines himself a knight and a brave sailor, only to illustrate the fun in being himself in his own home. The only other worthwhile clips are live-action clips of kids, one is ""Happy Happiness,"" with kids playing on the beach.
I'd buy this for the Ernie clip, but don't expect too much from the rest.",1042588800,3,892,4.875
7859122,4,6304016182,"My 2 year old son wasn't thrilled with this 30-minute video and hasn't asked to watch it repeatedly like he does with the videos he really enjoys, maybe because he has other Sesame Street Videos and some of the bits and songs are used from other videos, so he is starting to get a little bit bored.  However, he did enjoy the song about the rain, and he really likes to see anything with Zoey in it.  Probably because Elmo isn't in it at all he doesn't take as much of an interest in it, as Elmo is the character he appears to feel the most comfortable with and helps link him with the other characters.  Also it seems that the concepts in the video are for a slightly older child.  Still, an enjoyable amd worthwhile video, as are all Sesame Street videos!  I do prefer the newer 50 minute Elmo's World video formats, as does my son.",1029024000,2,834,4.253164556962025
