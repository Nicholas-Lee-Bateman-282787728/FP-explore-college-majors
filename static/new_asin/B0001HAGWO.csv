2001413,5,B0001HAGWO,"Don't blame Amazon for the lack of title info; the distributor does not provide the titles in its sales copy, which Amazon has reproduced exactly. Considering the number of products here, it would take quite a hefty staff to do otherwise, and you can kiss Amazon's low prices goodbye!

The cover art of this set (which Amazon doesn't have at the moment) lists a few titles:

A Farewell To Arms

Against the Wind

Home of the Brave

Clouds Over Europe

The Big Lift

Anna Karenina

Hill Number One

This Is The Army

Sundown

We can safely assume that the rest of the titles are less well-known, but if it's true to the series there will be some unknown gems, and probably quite a few stinkers including some made-for-TV drek. It is also possible that one or more of the films named may not be the well-known version.

But the bottom line: $0.63 per movie. Do you really need to know more than that?",1098057600,20,898,4.441717791411043
2001414,3,B0001HAGWO,Why does Amazon never print what selections are on these disc's?? I know its 50 movies but at least a small selection might provoke one to buy an unknown entity!,1097971200,7,161,4.4
2001415,5,B0001HAGWO,"Documentaries:  Most were made during WW2 so they were meant to bolster morale.  So some details are missing.  But they are fast paced with a lot of action and great film shots.  They cover most areas of the war.  Excellent value.

After Mein Kampf  - British documentary made during WW2 mostly covers the rise of Hitler and Nazism in Germany and the Hitler Youth.

The Secret Life of Adolf Hitler - Some more info about Hitler.

The Nazis Strike - Events leading up to the invasion of Poland along with the military campaign of its fall.

Divide and Conquer  - One of the better documentaries made during WW2 covers the fall of Denmark, Holland, the Netherlands, Norway and France.

The Battle of Britain - Propaganda film made during WW2, has a lot of action and is interesting.  However, if you want a more realistic view of what actually happened and losses encored, you may want to get the movie Battle of Britain.

The Battle of Russia - This propaganda film by the US government has so many blatant lies and half truths that it is almost painful to watch.  However, it is a good example why people should not fully trust the US government to tell them the truth.

The Great Battle of the Volga - Russian documentary of the WW2 battle of Stalingrad.

Submarine Warfare - Actually this contains 2 documentaries.  The first is the capture of the German submarine U505 during WW2 by the Americans (now on display in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago).  Second is the use of submarines by the US in the Pacific in WW2.  Much of the second documentary was staged.

Combat America - Documentary of life of a US B17 squadron.  The narration is a bit corny at times.  But the film is OK.

The Memphis Belle - This documentary made during WW2 is about the first US bomber which completed 25 missions in Europe.

Thunderbolt - Shows what life and combat is like for a group of P47 fighter pilots in Italy during WW2.  Slow paced.

Desert Victory - British WW2 documentary covering the battles from El Alamein to the attack on Tripoli in north Africa.

Tunisian Victory - Another good documentary.  This time about the North African campaign from the time of the Torch landings until the final victory over the Axis.  Well made, well paced.  It was made in 1944 so it does not discuss Allied failures.

The Battle of San Pietro - Attack on a town in Italy during WW2.

True Glory - Documentary made in 1945 which summarizes the war in western Europe from the build up for D-Day until the final victory.  Highlights major campaigns.  Good, fast paced, but limited detail as it is only 81 minutes long.

Nuremberg Trials - War crimes trial after WW2.

Prelude to War - Documentary made during WW2 showing events that lead up to the war.  A lot of it is propaganda

The Battle of China - Interesting documentary made during WW2 covering the first 12 years of the war between China and Japan.  Discusses the major campaigns of Japan against China.

The Stilwell Road - Documentary focuses on the opening of the road from India to China during WW2 to keep supplies flowing to the Chinese troops.  Covers both the combat for and construction of the road.

December 7, 1941 - Made during WW2, many facts were omitted for security reasons.  The documentary also shows US Dauntless dive bombers painted up to look like Japanese Vals.  However, is interesting and has a lot of action.

Report from the Aleutians - WW2 documentary setting up an air base in the Alaskan Aleutian islands.

Attack! The Battle for New Britain - This documentary covers the US attack on the island of New Britain in the Pacific.  It covers the training, invasion, and combat of US forces during the attack.  Contains some interesting jungle fighting footage.  My favorite of the documentaries in the set.

Attack in the Pacific - Covers Pearl Harbor and Midway battles and island hopping campaign.  Info more flawed that other documentaries.

Payoff in the Pacific - Good, fast paced documentary, made after WW2, summarizes the major US campaigns in the Pacific.  Limited detail because it is only 77 minutes long.

To the Shores of Iwo Jima - This 41 min documentary,  made during WW2, is actually 2 in one.  The first part is about the battle of Iwo.  The second is the invasion of Guadalcanal.  Made to build up the moral of the people back home.

Appointment in Tokyo - This 55 minute documentary made just after WW2 mostly covers the re-conquest of the Philippines by the US.

Marines at Tarawa-Return to Guam - Short documentary with a quick summary of the 2 invasions.

THIS IS THE ARMY
GO FOR BROKE - So-so film about the US 442 battalion of Japanese Americans in WW2.  Mostly stories about the men, not much combat and little about their famous combat history.

2001421,5,B0001HAGWO,"My husband and I decided to stick to a far lower budget than normal this past Christmas, and I was looking for videos with anything to do with WWII for him. This set was amazingly priced for it's contents, though I was skeptical about the contents. Here we are, about one month later, and on a car trip this past weekend, he said to me, ""By the way, I want to thank you again for that video set. It's great!"" He went on to describe several of the documentaries he's watched that he hadn't seen before, and said that the contents were all full length featured items. He is a WWII collector and has many many videos, so I was delighted he enjoyed this set so much. It's nothing I'd watch, but it is a great gift for WWII buffs.",1200960000,6,725,4.185714285714286

But some really look like they were filmed off a moviescreen with handycam.
The movies r also a mix from very good down to very bad.

2001427,4,B0001HAGWO,"The ""classics"" in the WAR CLASSICS 50 MOVIE PACK must surely be the many contemporary documentaries included in this set. These chronicles of a war in progress are both American and foreign made-- the most unusual for Western eyes being those from the USSR. The theatrical films included here aren't blockbusters by any means, yet they should still have appeal to fans of the war genre.

2001430,5,B0001HAGWO,This collection is half movies and half documentaries. I really don't watch the movies but the documentaries are fantastic. Most of them are old dating back to '45. You get to see the perspective of the war as it happened. If you like history & ww2 this is a must have!!!,1168819200,7,271,4.333333333333333
2001431,4,B0001HAGWO,"If you are seeking excellent war movies, especially WWII vintage, this is NOT the set for you.  The best - and only excellent movie in this collection (in my opinion) is ""Three Came Home.""  I would rate the others (approximately 29 movies) ranging from 'Fair' to 'Good.'  Almosat all of the real-life heart-wrenching psychological dramas (""The Best Years Of Our Lives,"" ""13 Rue Madelasine,"" etc. etc.) are NOT found herein.  John Wayne's efforts cannot be found herein.  Approximate 1/3 are from WWII; 1/3 are US from other eras (4 Civil War, and 2 cover post WWII strife - for example ""The Big Lift;"" and the final 1/3 (or 7 movies) pertain to other countries (4 involve France, 2 include Africa, and 1 Mexican Robin Hood(lum) revolutionary type is in ""The Torch"" starring Paulette Goddard.  Each movie averaged 1 hour and 40 minutes running time.

Do you like history retold in a documentary format?  If you do, think very carefully about purchasing this collection.  I consider ""Victory At Sea"" to be the best of any WWII documentaries.  Yet, in at least one category, these documentaries outshine ""Victory at Sea.""  The long range history of each of our allies is extensively covered.  Our enemies goals and objectives are also included.  Nuremberg Trials, and ""The Secret Life of Adolph Hitler"" are shown to give the viewer a more balanced viewpoint.  Of course, what is missing, and may never be adequately answered is ""why?""  Are we really that far away (above?) the animal kingdom.  What is 'MAN' really like, when the trappings of civilization is withdrawn?  Have you ever seen people literally go crazy on New Year's Eve?  Obviously the conditions and rationale are completely different.  But it takes very little coaxing to return to our roots.  There are nearly 30 wonderfully thought provoking documentaries.  They each average a little less than 1 hour viewing time (actually 53 minutes).  It is a wonderful thought provoking epic (epoch?), that should not be missed.",1166659200,11,1981,4.975609756097561

But this box is different. It has 28 WWII documentaries plus 22 War movies which most of them have transfered in rather good quality and most of them are in color. this box really deserves something and you'll got an excellent collection.

The only other box except this one which worth to buy in these collections is ""50 MOVIE MARTIAL ARTS CLASSICS"" which there is surprisingly no sign on it on amazon.com

and there is a complain about the box, although this is a rather cheap DVD collection but it's not a good reason that the studio, sell it in an extremely weak paper box. If you buy it from amazon.com, you'll probably receive it undamaged but if you order it to a 3rd party seller, It will be highly possible that you receive a sealed but damaged box and it's not fault of the seller. such a weak box needs a hugh box that costs more than the price that amazon.com charge you for the shipping cost of an item!

8012561,5,B0001HAGWO,"I won't elaborate much more on content as many other reviews do a good job of this.  The set, as you probably know now, is a mixture of documentaries and movies recorded on 12, dual-sided DVD's.  As it would happen, the majority of the movies are on the first few DVD's.  As I watched them in numerical order, I was somewhat disappointed in the movies.  Some aren't bad, but others just couldn't hold my interest -- curious, as I have quite a war-movie collection and I can usually find something in a plot that makes me want to watch.  Others, the video and sound quality is below average.  For example, the Adventures of Tartu is a re-edit of Sabotage Agent.  It's a good movie, but the blurry quality, tight edits, and muddy sound almost make it unwatchable to me, having seen the more complete Sabotage Agent on TCM.  While the majority of movies relate to WWII, not all do.  Despite having so many movies included for less than $30, I was considering only giving the set 3 of 5 stars, as all I had been seeing so far were the movies.  The documentaries pulled the rating up.

And boy, did they pull it up.  Many of the documentaries are excellent, several even filmed in color during WWII.  I didn't get this fact from any other reviews, and the (6? or so) full color documentaries are worth the price of the entire set alone.  They typically deal with the Pacific war, such a Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Kiska/Dutch Harbor.  Others, mostly in black and white, deal with the European theatre, and another good one was about Soviet/US/Canada spy networks.  Curiously, this last one was in B&W, despite being made in the early 1980's.  There is a great deal of real combat footage, and I was surprised how much I could see and learn about what it was like for those involved.  Some have alarming scenes.  Black and white images can sometimes distance the viewer from what the actual scenes are showing, but I tend to see past that now and images in this way can occasionally be grisly, which of course is the true face of war.  You can grasp a sense of what it was really like for those who were there.

Most of the documentaries are made with the style typical of the time, with patriotic cues, or certain production values that look quite different from television today.  Personally, I like the style as it's authentic, but some may not agree.

If the set only included the documentaries it would easily get 5/5 stars.  I consider the movies a throw-in.  Overall score is 5/5, as even if you ignored all the movies, each documentary would average only $1 a piece.  Unbeatable.",1247356800,8,2575,4.51948051948052
