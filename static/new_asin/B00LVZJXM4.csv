6508381,5,B00LVZJXM4,Thank you very much.  Good arrival and quality,1502668800,,46,4.75

6508383,5,B00LVZJXM4,I loved all the crow movies,1501200000,,27,3.6666666666666665
6508384,5,B00LVZJXM4,Great buy/bargain/deal! Every Crow fan should have these in their collection,1498780800,,76,6.0
6508385,5,B00LVZJXM4,"Awesome deal!!! 3 movies, 1 disc, $5...you can't beat that! Plus I'm a huge fan of The Crow comics and movie/TV series. Now I'm not praising the movies in this bundle to a high degree (c'mon we all know these movies are fun yet inferior to the origina) but I will say it's a great deal and I will continue to watch them every year during Halloween!",1497225600,,348,4.208955223880597
6508386,3,B00LVZJXM4,"It's very difficult to rate this DVD, as it contains three films.  If you are a fan of ""The Crow"", you will probably enjoy ""City of Angeles"", just not as much as the original, so I would give it four stars.  ""Salvation"", is just okay, so I would give it three stars.  ""Wicked Prayer"", however, might just be the absolute worst film that I've ever seen.  The plot itself is ridiculous and boring.  Edward Furlong as the Crow, was totally miscast.  Considering the cost, if you would want to have the complete series, it's worth the purchase.  Just don't expect much from ""Wicked Prayer"".  Best to watch it when you have time to watch something else after it; something that will restore your faith in cinema; something like the original, ""The Crow"".",1496361600,2,748,4.613636363636363

6508388,1,B00LVZJXM4,"Who is the stupid effing idiot at MIRAMAX and/or Lionsgate who approved this package of 3 movies but only ""Salvation"" is on the disc at Dolby Digital 5.1 surround?  The other two films are only 2.0.  Who does that?!?  Why bother!!!",1495238400,,231,4.585365853658536

6508414,5,B00LVZJXM4,My new favorite movie City of Angels.,1457654400,,37,4.428571428571429
6508415,1,B00LVZJXM4,"Every one of these films is awful.  While the second and third film may have a few redeeming qualities, Wicked Prayer is complete trash.  If you're like me and you loved the first film and/or the original graphic novel, I recommend you steer well clear of these films.

I was shocked to see with 27 votes (and no votes below 3 stars) this box set had a rating on amazon of 4.6... That's the same rating the first film currently holds!  Now I know the rating can't be right because I could take all the best elements from the second, third and fourth film, combine them together into one film and it would still not be worth watching.  This review is my small attempt to right this great wrong.

Terrible Crow franchise films like these are the reason I quit buying Crow-related merchandise unless it comes directly from or is in collaboration with James O'Barr.  I got so sick of watching O'Barr's incredible graphic novel get degraded with each passing budget film and Brandon Lee's image being exploited and plastered all over my local Hot Topic.  You have to wonder when you buy opportunistic tripe like this, 'who am I supporting really'?

If you haven't read the original graphic novel I encourage you to do so.  It's everything you imagine it will be and so much more.  It was for me at least.  Lets hope the upcoming ""reboot"" does James O'Barr and Brandon Lee justice.",1457568000,8,1375,4.56734693877551

6508430,5,B00LVZJXM4,"This set is a steal at 5 dollars. I found this in a 5 dollar bin at Walmart and immediately picked it up in excitement. The only disappointing thing is no subtitles. I don't care that it had no extras, but no subtitles is a bummer. But, for 5 dollars, it is still worth the money. Transfers are good on all 3 movies. Part 2 and 3 are both good, but part 4 Wicked Prayer is the worst sequel I have ever seen in my life. A better script may gave given it a prayer, but this was a lost cause. Watch 2 and 3, but skip part 4.",1430352000,5,521,3.7889908256880735

6508433,3,B00LVZJXM4,"The Crow City of Angels with Vincent Perez this one was okay, it was along the same lines as the ""one and only"" original with Brandon. so this was an entertaining enough movie. The Crow Salvation, of the 3 on this DVD, this is probably my favorite. It is my favorite thanks to Eric Mabius and the guy who comes back after being executed for murdering his girlfriend, which we all know he didn't. Oh, and my favorite in spite of one of the worst actresses on the planet being in it, Kirsten Dunst (and she got top billing???????) She's a hack. The third was my WTH movie????? How in the name of God did David Boreanaz get suckered into this mess? He's an amusing bad guy. Edward Furlong as the returning Crow? Edward Furlong? Really? Oh, this has another of the worst actresses...EVER....Tara Reid, Really? Plus this goes into a whole witchcraft, demon thing, really? So Wicked Prayer just had no prayer.",1425340800,4,903,4.54601226993865

8668432,2,B00LVZJXM4,"I purchased 'The Crow Collection' 'Triple Feature' that was showing as an add-on item for $5 US with a single disc.  I received the single disc and all three moves are on it as advertised, but NONE of them are Closed-captioned.  Lions Gate is usually pretty good about putting subtitles aka close captioning on their movies but for only $5 it's really not worth the effort to try and return it. At least i have them all now... maybe they'll put out a BD combo pack one day...",1523059200,,475,4.386363636363637
