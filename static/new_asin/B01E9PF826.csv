7734063,3,B01E9PF826,"Not terrible at all, but considering this was the first Legoverse use of less-obvious Batman family members AND first Legoverse use of  the Teen Titans as a group AND they had to voice cast from Teen Titans involved, there's almost enough demand generated right off the ...bat...for a theatrical release.  So for the creators to just blow their whole marketing wad with a lukewarm effort like this is disappointing.  Large portions of plot fall into a silly fantasy category that doesn't mesh with what we accept for the characters.  Nothing of interest for adults, but the younger kids will be delighted to see the Teen Titans",1468195200,2,627,4.886792452830188

We like the new Lego movie and are wanting to see Lego Batman (2017) thinking this title would have the same level of snark and humor, but really it's for little kids.

7734098,3,B01E9PF826,"Even though there's a new theatrical film featuring Lego versions of Batman, that's a spinoff of The Lego Movie, which is inside the imagination of a young boy, so technically that one is ""Bootleg Batman"", while the one featured in the Lego Batman video games and DC Comics Lego animated movies/TV specials are considered to be the more canonical. This latest one mixes in the standard Justice League with the extended Batman cast.

 Starting out in Gotham with Batman breaking in a new Robin(no specifics as to which of the multiple Robin understudies it is)while thwarting a supervillain team-up of Penguin and Harley Quinn. After arresting them, Batman is surprised by his allies from the JLA and Teen Titans for his anniversary as a crimefighter, and allow Batman to take a vacation with Nightwing and Batgirl while Superman watches over Gotham in the meantime. The movie then splits up into two recurring plots, with Batman and his former proteges chasing Deathstroke, and Superman bungling by releasing the inmates from Arkham. The story with Batman after Deathstroke leads into Bane and a completely made up for the ""DC Legoverse"" plot of Batman's old martial arts teacher Madame Mantis and an underground civilization of cave people. The other and better plot has Superman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg being completely inept at dealing with Batman's rogues gallery despite their incredible powers, so Robin has to bale them out in the end.

Gotham City Breakout is a textbook example of what to take or leave in an all-ages production. The portion with Batman on vacation is like some abandoned Ninjago plot that Lego didn't bother with, while the parts of the Justice League succumbing to villains using laughing gas and robot penguins is much more enjoyable. The film is good enough for kids to wet their appetites for The Lego Batman movie, but most standard DC fans could pretty much skip it.",1486425600,,1901,4.971698113207547

The production on these ""Lego"" movies just keeps getting better and better. The story lines may be a little silly, but they're cartoons! They're supposed to be silly and fun. There's enough over the little one's head humor to keep adults entertained, also. Like all the lego movies, it's a little on the short side, but that's not a big deal.

7734118,3,B01E9PF826,"Nightwing was by far the best part of this movie. Otherwise, I would have been kind to give it 2 stars. In fact, the vast majority of the shallow laughs I had came from Nightwing and just a few from Superman. (Batgirl was also okay in this, but they could have given her more personality).
If this is for your kid, they will love it. But for older audiences, it is not worth buying. Might as well watch it online somewhere when you have nothing better to do.
They used the voice actor of Robin from Teen Titans, which was a mistake (in my opinion) and a rather obvious attempt to appeal to the kiddies who love TTG. The other titans had no purpose in this movie at all and just randomly showed up at the beginning, end, and for a brief minute in the middle. Also, if you look at the IMDB page for cast listings, it says that this Robin is supposed to be Damian Wayne. Umm...no. Not even close! The voice actor played Robin from Teen Titans, who was a version of Dick Grayson's Robin. But since we already have Nightwing and Jason is rarely given screen time, I figured it would be Tim Drake. This Robin is witty and always makes every sentence some lame one-liner. He hero-worships Batman and likes to have regular fun like a normal kid. That is NOT Damian Wayne! But the black sleeves and pants on Robin's costume suggest otherwise...
Half of the plot involves Batman, Nightwing, and Batgirl going on an adventure to save Batman's former teacher from a secret society of beings that are being mind-controlled by a couple of villains. The secret society is uninteresting , and the running gag that is supposed to be funny just gets really annoying. So half the plot is just a nuisance. And to make it worse, one of the best villains in all of DC becomes a softy at the end in a typical ""kids movie"" fashion of the villain realizing what he is doing is wrong and blah, blah, blah...
Superman is super-arrogant in this movie. It's supposed to be ironic comedy, but it just makes you want to punch him every time he talks about how much better he is for having powers.
I'm not a Joker fan, but I absolutely HATED him in this. He couldn't go one line of dialogue without immediately following it up by talking in the perspective of some spoon. Harley even made a better villain than him in this movie.
As another commented said, Nightwing and Batgirl were severely underplayed. They were made to seem helpless and vastly inferior to Batman. They couldn't defend themselves or get out of trouble. Basically, the were treated as newbie, kid, sidekicks rather than fully-grown, experienced, adult allies who had been trained by the Batman himself for YEARS.
Batman was a bit annoying in this, too. Every five minutes, he was talking about how he predicted this move and this outcome, etc. It's okay if they do it a couple of times in a movie to show Batman's genius, but they did it CONSTANTLY in this! It made it seem like Batman was just trying to show off and seem better than everybody.
As I said, a kid would probably love this. But most adults would see this as ""meh"", at best. It's predictable, not very funny, and portrays several characters or aspects of characters poorly. Kids won't really notice this stuff too much, which is why if you're thinking about getting this for your 6-year-old, go for it. Just don't expect them to still adore this movie in a couple of years' time. And don't think this is a movie the ""whole family"" can enjoy. And for your own sanity, just hope this isn't that one movie your kid feels the need to re-watch over and over and over and over....

All that said... Can't wait for The Lego Batman Movie to do some real justice to the Lego Batman/DC film franchise...",1479859200,,3695,4.465976331360947
7734119,5,B01E9PF826,"I have had to sit through this movie seven times already. My five year old loves it!
As a hostage, multiple viewings aren't so bad. It could be worse...Caillou could be in it. Thankfully, he is not.
Soon, I will begin to despise this movie as I do all others.
Still I give it 5 stars for the hour respite.",1479772800,,305,4.1

7734121,5,B01E9PF826,"Just  finished watching ""Justice League - Gotham City Breakout"" released by Warner Brothers.
Poor Batman!  The Justice League has thrown him a surprise party
and with the help of Batgirl and Nightwing, Superman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the league has managed to convince the crime fighting workaholic to take a holiday - with Batgirl and Nightwing in tow as enforcers - with the promise that they will look after Gotham City while he's away.
A Very Super Mistake.
Superman, much to Robin's chagrin, enforces the Boy Wonder's bedtime and insists that he does his homework because he's Superman and he can certainly handle any non-super-powered villains that may show up.
Unbeknownst to Superman, the Joker escapes from Arkham with the help of a spoon, which he uses to trick the Man of Steel into releasing all the psychotic criminals from Arkahm.
Soon it becomes apparent to the Justice League that they should have given Batman far more credit than they had.
Meanwhile, Batman's pleasant vacation turns into a bit of a stressful one when Bane appears on the scene.
GREAT FUN!

7734191,5,B01E9PF826,"This movie has no deep questions or hardcore morals to slap you in the face. It is merely a goofy storyline from lego. They are at their best when they are coming up with something original.
As an adult, I did roll my eyes during parts of the movie that got a little annoying. But if you are looking for something lighthearted and joyful that isn't afraid to be silly this is your movie.",1468454400,2,387,4.243243243243243

8758199,4,B01E9PF826,"Awesome movie with tons of action. My son and I both love this movie and found it to be quite entertaining.

However, for me, this purchase was about the exclusive Nightwing minifig that comes with this movie. Whenever LEGO offers the chance to get an exclusive minifig for a reasonable price, then I'm going to jump at the chance. This was that chance.

Great movie... excellent exclusive minifig, this is a win-win type purchase for me. You'll be pleased and won't regret this purchase.

Happy bricking!",1529798400,,505,4.848837209302325
