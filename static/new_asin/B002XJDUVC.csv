8383714,5,B002XJDUVC,"I bought this dvd for my 2 year old daughter to watch while sitting in my car for a four hour drive to visit grandpa and grandma.  She loves it!  It's great b/c it's 90 minutes long so unlike the baby einstein videos I'm not switching dvds all of the time.  All of the wow wow movies seem to be longer versions of the tv show plugged together into one long movie though, so if you watch it on tv, you'll most likely recognize different scenes.  My daughter didn't mind that in the least.",1299110400,2,487,4.148936170212766

8383716,5,B002XJDUVC,"As always, Wubbzy has done it again!  This DVD is adorable!  Since my boys are little, we watched this instead of the Olympics and all of us enjoyed it.  The DVD's lesson is to make sure  you are having fun when playing sports.  It also shows how there is no substitution for practicing as of course there are some high-tech gadgets involved!  I personally loved how the DVD used a real-life celebrity Michelle Kwan in the episode, which my sons had no idea who it was but it is a nice for parents watching along with kids.

Overall, this is a great and wholesome DVD for families to watch.  Wubbzy features great lessons and graphics.  It is 81 minutes long and perfect to watch an episode here and there or watch the whole DVD at one time.",1267574400,,741,4.350364963503649
