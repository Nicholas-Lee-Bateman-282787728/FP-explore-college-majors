5318128,5,B009D509QI,"...of this film a few days ago. the director, the producer & the composer of the score were all there
taking questions & making comments afterwards. i took a little posse with me...we were 5 total.
it's fair to say that, between the 5 of us, our tastes run a bit varied. i say this to illustrate
just how hands down amazing this film is. we all came out bewildered. it's a truly
amazing piece of work in all possible ways. i urge everyone to see it.",1346716800,3,449,4.172413793103448
5318129,5,B009D509QI,"Yes it's a beautiful film about life the struggle between man and nature.ideological based strife
And those that have a lot materially and those that don't. It's shot at 65mm then processed onto 4k digital. The opening shots of a lava eruption both day and night shots are simply stunning. There are some disturbing shots that have to do with slaughter of chickens and pigs so keep this in mind. There are tender shots too so do not despair. The breadth of imagery is so rich, powerful and really unforgettable it will enrich you 4.5 stars",1346544000,71,539,4.625

5318141,4,B009D509QI,"This is the second time in a row that the film makers produced a documentary with complex subjects and perfecting it with a lavish work of 70 mm camera work and soundtrack. Samsara is technically superior to their former film ""Baraka"" but not by a large margin. On the other hand, Samsara will make viewers uncomfortable in a number of sequences. Those segments would be unnecessary to watch but the film makers wanted to make a point about the stupidity of mankind, and therefore it leaves us no room to wish less.

From a technical point of view, this Blu-Ray release is a reference for picture quality, possibly for evaluating how good your TV/projector performs. I am using it in the LG E7 OLED screen, with a Technicolor preset adjustment. As a result it is one of the best looking images I have seen in years.",1519257600,,815,4.582191780821918

5318181,4,B009D509QI,"Good, but not great. The visuals are stunning as per usual from Mr. Fricke. In Baraka, I got the themes. I got the flow and the feel for what was being told. In Samsara, it was not until I watched the behind the scenes until I got it. Up until then having already watched it twice, Samsara was a series of pretty pictures. If it takes the behind the scenes talk of the producer, director, etc. for me to get this, then they have failed on some level. I have watched every movie Ron Fricke has been the DP and/or Director on and while this is one of his most beautiful, it is also his weakest overall.",1507680000,,600,4.136752136752137

5318201,5,B009D509QI,"This film starts out with these strange little Balinese dancers making goo goo eyes.  So its weird from the start.  Many fantastic images are then unravelled.  But you know you are also in for a tough ride when one of the only Anglos in the film is sitting behind a corporate desk and starts rubbing some kind of gray goo over his mouth.  He then proceeds to go mad, smearing the stuff all over his face and head, then painting switches of black over his eyes and streaks of red out the corners of his mouth so that he ends up looking a lot like Jack Nicholson in Batman.  This scene is important because it wakes you up to the fact that this is not going to be your standard travelogue.

I left this movie feeling more frightened than anything.  Living in southern Arizona, I am mostly surrounded by silent desert that is both boring and peaceful.  The monsoon rains are about it for excitement.

What stands out is how beautiful all of the horrible things humans are involved with from mass killings of chickens and people to massive garbage dumps and gangs can be.  Hidden in some of the dehumanized scenes are those eyes that betray an awareness that this is not right.  If you are going to eat the chicken you should at least have the decency to be the one that breaks its neck.  One reason country people genuinely smile as they have no guilt.

Fascinating film",1501200000,,1367,4.42

I was someone with a lot of makeup sitting at a desk doing some types of really repulsive gory things that had no relation to the movie. It ruined the movie. I tried to finish the movie but I had to eject it. The first part I watched was amazing and I am sure I will finish it someday.

 I don't like documentary and never see it by purchasing it.
 But this one is pure art. There is no story but if you finish this film, you will learn that the director Ron Fricke wanted to tell us that our life is small, and after its been done, there will be nothing left but your life experience, memory of some creation descending to our future progeny who will continue this world. So live every minute as if it is your last. It clearly says by showing the colorful sand made picture at the very end destroying them all that have been made using 3-4 hours to complete. (See the video above-second one)

Seems to him, the most beautiful thing seems nothing at all. Only the memory lasts forever just like us watching movies and the image, sound lasts in our head and heart. Nothing is important.
 This documentary shows everything. The beauty of nature, the creation of human- building, how they deal with animal to eat them and survive, how to kill others by using weapons, even shows fake human female dolls to enjoy the pleasure. He even compare that lifeless dolls with

Japanese Gaisha. What is human and what is not? The women on the stage only wearing bikini with their own number tag waiting for a male to choose them for one hour pleasure is compared with human like sex dolls.(There are male dolls too but its not beautiful to show so not in the movie.)

It seems that for the director, Miyanma is the most beautiful country. The country of dance with hands, creation of colorful sand picture, beautiful mosques, and so on.

Then there is China, creation of vast food- hens, cows are not animals here. There are simply product for human feed. Also most of the sex dolls are made in China too.

Japan, Korea are briefly mentioned but not huge interest for him. Rather Africa, European countries like Italy or America is more important. Bottom line is human they create anything to survive.

Then they dissembles them all when they are not necessary. Garbage, garbage they have to deal with then.

Dubai, some other Mid-Eastern countries are rather not be spoken. They are just for sightseeing purpose. Some stormy view of human praising their own god, Enormous buildings, Sand wind in the middle of dessert- not dirty but so calm.

This movie was shot masterfully in 70mm format/ I-max. Spent 5 years from all around the world. You don't need another trip if you watch this movie. Its all there. So is it just a documentary?

This tells you that without a single word, he can still make you feel a lot of things from collections of videos. Also attached is his other film BARAKA. Another masterpiece of his work for free.

8540089,5,B009D509QI,"An imagery-trip around the world, one thing tying to the other, in what amounted, to me, as a rather nihilistic view of mankind, that we should decay back into dust. I can't disagree with it, as it isn't saying anything. It just shows us our honest devestation.

It isn't all ugly. Much of the film we see the destruction our desires have on the world, but book-ended to this are scenes of amazing Buddhist artistry and performance. These Buddhist-arts require so much time, energy, and devotion. And they exist only as things to do in the moment. The Buddhists spend hours creating an intricate mandala of sand. They smile at it, a culmination made from so many people, probably hundreds of hours, and then they just wipe it away. The joy was had, the creation is done, why attach to it any longer? This Buddhist-ideal juxtaposes harshly to the rest of the film.

Great filming, and melancholic. A reviewer on the cover calls the film ""uplifting"". I'm doubtful that person even watched the film. It's not uplifting at all, because it really shouldn't be. But it does carry beauty in it, and sort of seems to persuade at the end that we needn't worry about mankind's impossible problems, because sand and dust will solve everything in time. Not uplifting, but I wouldn't call it dreary either. It is, at the very least, honest, and at times, beautiful.",1529884800,,1352,4.70042194092827

8540097,5,B009D509QI,"For a movie with little to no dialogue, I was moved. I originally watched this in a film theory class and could not believe what I saw.

EVERY CINEMATOGRAPHY or anyone that wants to be one, NEEDS to watch this. Every single shot is well thought out and captured in a stunning 8k resolution.

This movie is not for those with a weak heart. It will open your eyes to things that just seem too sad to be true.

Highly recommend though.",1524614400,,432,4.2439024390243905
