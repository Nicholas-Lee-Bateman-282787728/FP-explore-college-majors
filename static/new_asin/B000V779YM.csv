8216959,4,B000V779YM,"This is a video presentation of a live performance, though better than the usual one-camera ""focus & forget"" coverage. I'm guessing it's unavailable--except on old VHS cassettes--because Low Moan Spectacular is also making the script available for live theater production of the play. Maybe they figure it being out on DVD would make that less likely? I don't know. Anyway, I used to have a VHS copy of this, but somehow managed to tape over it. I'm very glad to find this again after so many years.",1453161600,,499,4.747126436781609
8216960,5,B000V779YM,One of the funniest plays I've ever seen. Slapstick done RIGHT.,1449100800,,63,4.818181818181818
8216961,5,B000V779YM,"I saw this in 1984 on HBO, and it was the funniest thing I ever saw. I was doing semi-pro theater at the time, and I have never laughed as hard in my life before or in the 30 years since. I've been looking for a copy of this for years and years. Very bummed to find it listed here and not available. I'd pay $100 for a decent quality tape of it, if anyone has a copy...",1364601600,2,369,3.7435897435897436
8216962,3,B000V779YM,"Haven't seen since 1984 and it was worth the expense. Originally on cable, never seen again. Silly stuff full of great, stupid physical humor. VHS has its technical limitations and this post-rental copy had wear but you can't expect any better for such an aged cassette. A lost gem worth a DVD release. Enjoy the VHS while you can.",1358208000,,331,4.627118644067797
8216963,5,B000V779YM,"$60 is a little steep for a VHS, but this was well worth it.  Transferred well to DVD.  Could be more polished, but I'm sure eventually someone will release a DVD of the actual performance.",1326844800,,189,4.371428571428571
8216964,5,B000V779YM,"If you have not seen this tour de FARCE, you have missed out!  This is a show with many many sight gags and lots of physical comedy as well as funny situations and lines you won't forget.  These actors are BRILLIANT!  Especially Diz White and Alan Shearman.  You have to see it to believe it - and once you see it you won't forget it.  Also check out ""Bullshot Crummond"" by the same group.  So GOOD!",1257120000,,399,4.184210526315789
8216965,5,B000V779YM,"I first saw this comedic gem back in 1980 when it played on the fledgling cable media called HBO. Having just gotten one of the brand new VHS recorders I managed to get it on tape. During the following years I have watched it at least annually and it never ceases to delight and draw huge gales of laughter.

The Low Moan Spectacular, a quartet of brilliant comic minds that began as a stage ensemble in the late 1960's produced a stunningly funny musical review off-Broadway called El Grande de Coca-Cola and followed it up with this comic masterpiece. Personally I am shocked that this recording has not been re-released during the intervening years. Most current comedies pale in comparison.

The concept is simple. A small, private school, running short on funds, decides to host a benefit performance of an obscure play to raise money. They bring in a self-important and not terribly competent writer/director from New York and all take roles in the production. But the play stinks, their acting is ghastly, they are under-rehearsed and having enormous personal conflicts with one another. The result is one of the funniest, most brilliant concoctions of physical, verbal and situational comedy ever created.

The perspective itself is unique. Performed live on stage the audience's point of view is reversed, as if they were sitting upstage behind the action. Indeed, when the curtain at the back of the stage opens it reveals rows of ""audience members"" (manikins with arms that clap) staring back at us.

IF you are fortunate enough to have the chance to see this brilliant work, by all means do so. You will not be disappointed in the least, I promise.",1231977600,3,1660,4.875886524822695
