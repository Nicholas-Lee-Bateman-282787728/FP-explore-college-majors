8271731,5,B00007CVUV,"I love this DVD. It has 8 live performances on it. This DVD has the three original members on it. The best part of the DVD is that it gives you rehearsal bits of songs, behind the scenes footage, and some footage of their down time when they are playin golf and riding bumper cars. This was a great purchase.",1047427200,,308,4.15
