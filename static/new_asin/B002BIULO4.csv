3894683,5,B002BIULO4,"""BLEACH"", the popular, long and currently running Shonen Jump manga and anime series originally created by Tite Kubo gets its second film released on DVD in the US.

The second film is directed by Noriyuki Abe (""Bleach"", ""Ninku"", ""Ghost Stories"", ""Great Teacher Onizuka"" and ""Yu Yu Hakusho""), a screenplay by Michiko Yokote (""Big Windup!"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Genshiken"", "".Hack/SIGN"", ""Bleach"" and ""Gintama""), music by Shiro Sagisu (""Bleach"", ""Casshern"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", ""Nadia - Secret of Blue Water"" and ""Kimagure Orange Road"") and character designs by Masashi Kudo (""Witch Hunter Robin"", ""Wings of Rean"" and ""Bleach"").

The second film ""The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" takes place after ""Bleach"" episode 150 and revolves around Squad 10 Captain Toshirou Hitsugaya.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""BLEACH the Movie 2 - The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" is definitely an animated film with a higher production value over its television series counterpart.  Sharp, vibrant colors, more detail and beautifully painted scenery.  The fact that so many characters (and even many locations) are featured in this film, needless to say that it's quite exciting to see so many people from the Soul Society involved in this film.  So, despite the challenges the studios had in creating this film in a short time, needless to say that they really pulled this off.  Backgrounds look great, nice amount of detail for the film version and for the most part, it's a colorful and vibrant film.

As for the audio, audio is featured in Japanese and English audio.  I've watched both in Japanese and with English, so needless to say that both voice acting for the English and Japanese side are well-done.  Certain sound effects and even musical score utilize the surround channel speakers but for the most part, the series is a front and center channel driven film.  Dialogue is easily heard and is clear and understandable. Personally, I found the film much more fun to watch with my receiver setting on stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are in English only.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""BLEACH the Movie 2 - The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" is featured on two discs (the first featuring the main film, the second disc on the special features).

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that I was surprised by ""BLEACH the Movie 2 - The Diamond Dust Rebellion"".

When it comes to animated films based on a long-running anime series, the truth is that most of them lean more towards good/average to an animated film that simply sucks.  And most of the time, the films have nothing to do with the television series.  So, it was great to find out that ""BLEACH the Movie 2 - The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" does have a connection.

Fortunately, the second ""BLEACH"" film is anything but.  I think that for fans, its one thing to get hyped of seeing trailers of Ichigo vs. Hitsugaya but what surprised me was the sheer amount of action featured in the film and the amount of characters.  Nearly every Soul Reaper is featured and most of them are featured in battle.  This is an all out war and so it's quite interesting to see all of this taking place.

For Toshirou Hitsugaya fans, he's one character that hasn't been utilized a lot, so it was nice to get to know part of his back history through this film.

Plot-wise, the film was OK but its strengths lies in its animation, its battle sequences and special effects and the mere fact that it's ""BLEACH"" eye candy to have so many characters in one film.

As for the DVD release, it's really cool to have the booklet and the Japanese-based interviews included on the second disc. So, there are some incentives of buying the DVD.

Overall, I enjoyed the film and I would expect ""BLEACH"" fans to enjoy it as well. Action packed, tragic, dramatic but with almost every character from the popular anime series `BLEACH' appearing in this anime series, the second film ""The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" is definitely recommended!",1253836800,,5804,4.980269989615784
3894684,5,B002BIULO4,"I'm a hard core fan of the Bleach series by Tite Kubo, being so I've watched all of the Japanese dubbed episodes of Bleach and a few of the English dubbed episodes (just to compare and contrast the voice quality).  Also I've watched all of the Bleach movies (1-3 ""Japanese dubbed"").  I have to say the story for the series and the movies (with the exception for some of the fillers are phenomenal.  What kills me about the series is the American voice actors that supposedly compliments each character's personality; for some reason I just can't accept the the fact that the American voices for Renji, Toshiro, Rangiku, pretty much the whole cast sounds off.  For me this slight awkwardness takes away a bit of the quality from the plot of the anime and movie series.  I'm not dogging down these talented voice actors, but honestly after watching and becoming familiar with the original Japanese cast then undergoing a transition of listening to the American voice actors performance I have to say I'm kind of like wtf man!?  Now that's off my chest, the movie, Bleach: The Diamond Dust Rebellion is pretty good in terms of plot until the very end where the final act of the movie (I won't spoil anything).  Other than this, I LOVED THIS MOVIE A WHOLE LOT, WORTH BUYING.",1253145600,,1270,4.642857142857143
3894685,4,B002BIULO4,"I gave this movie a four not because its a bad movie per say but because it just seemed rather abrupt toward the end. The product description tells a good description of the story so i'll say nothing about that other then it was a pretty interesting concept.

Toward the end of the movie however, the last battle was rather abrupt and seemed like it was just sort of thrown together last minute. For an example you saw Kenny knock down a tower and then you didn't see him again at all....where did he go?

I loved the music and if I could find the soundtrack here in America I would buy it in a heartbeat. Although the Jaws music while the Captain of squad 8 was taking a walk was a bit much. However, what do you expect with Bleach corny sometimes but always a good time.

Voice acting wise, I watched this in Japanese and I don't like the voice actors for the Japanese dub. The woman doing Toshiro's voice is clearly a woman and has a voice that is way to young sounding. Toshiro I believe should sound older because of how long he's lived, its many many human lifetimes in Soul Society. So for Bleach I prefer the English voices and they did a great job as always. So all and all good movie but seems a bit on the abrupt side.",1253145600,4,1229,4.1991525423728815
3894686,5,B002BIULO4,"This is a great movie. Sure it does not have any dubbed related features, but it does not need those considering this is a great movie.",1252627200,,135,4.230769230769231
3894687,3,B002BIULO4,The movie is good but the special feature's are just subbed from the japanese edition and no commentary track like with the first movie and behind the scene's of the dubbed actors,1252627200,,179,4.625
3894688,5,B002BIULO4,"Of all the characters in the popular manga/anime ""Bleach,"" Toshiro Hitsugaya is amongst the most popular.

And he even got his own movie: ""Bleach Movie 2: The Diamond Dust Rebellion,"" a beautifully animated anime that takes the ice-slinging child genius into an encounter with his own past (along with Ichigo and the others, of course). It has some basic canon flaws (since when can Ichigo fly?) but the storyline and animation are truly lovely.

While the Ouin is being transported, the procession is attacked and robbed -- and Hitsugaya unexpectedly takes off. Being an old fart who loves to blame people, Yamamoto puts the entire division under house arrest.

Meanwhile, Ichigo shelters an exhausted, badly-injured Hitsugaya -- only to have the boy-captain run away after one night, after muttering something about ""Kusaka."" His friends start sniffing around for evidence of this Kusaka, while the wounded Hitsugaya is tottering around Karakura -- and an execution order has been put on his head.

Then Captain Kyoraku is nearly killed by Hyorinmaru, at the same time that Hitsugaya was fighting Kira and Hisagi. During a battle with the mysterious Kusaka, Ichigo realizes who he is and why the Soul Society tried to kill him -- and how much power the Ouin his given him. Now Hitsugaya is determined to stop Kusaka, but Ichigo is determined that he won't be the only one to fight...

Perhaps the biggest problem with ""The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" is that it plays fast-and-loose with some of ""Bleach's"" canon, such as the idea that two people can have the same zanpakuto's spirit.

But if that can be overlooked, then ""The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" is a pretty brilliant piece of work -- more focused and intense than the first ""Bleach"" movie, and beautifully animated. The animation is precise, detailed and smooth, and everything is bathed in pale frosty light and wintry clouds, augmented by explosions of ice and blasts of mist and snow.

And it has plenty of amazing action sequences (a moonlit fight at a shrine) and some lovely visuals (the ornate cloud-borne procession in the first scene), right up to a spectacular climactic fight between Kusaka and all the most powerful Soul Reapers. Fortunately to keep things from becoming too grim, the writers also included a bit of comic relief -- namely Renji's method of ""resuscitating"" an unconscious Ichigo. Let's just say it doesn't involve mouth to mouth.

Obviously Hitsugaya gets the most development in this movie -- he's always been an icy loner, but here we get a glimpse of his past losses and a lone friendship. And once more, he tries to take on all the responsibility so others will be spared. Thankfully, the flashbacks are oblique enough that at first we don't realize what he's doing, or why.

Ichigo comes in a close second, since he's had that lone-wolf/tough guy act in the past, and it seems pretty natural that he'd want to help out someone who has the same emotional problems. But a lot of other characters get little spurts of attention -- the kindly Ukitake, shrewd Kyoraku, his uptight lieutenant Nanao (who loses her cool after he's injured), rough-edged Renji, and many others.

Even the villain is well done, since you can see how he ended up so bitter and vengeful -- although his little sidekicks are basically cannon fodder.

""Bleach Movie 2: The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" is a far smoother ride than the previous ""Bleach"" movie, with brilliant animation and a stunning ride into Hitsugaya's clouded past.",1243641600,37,3486,4.941880341880342

3894705,5,B002BIULO4,"Just finished watching ""Bleach - The Movie 2 - The Diamond Dust Rebellion"" released by VIZ Media.
Having a sense of honor can get a person into a boiling part of hot water when he attempts to do the right thing.
Of course, while it would be the most logical thing to do and let someone know what you're doing and why you're doing it; Toshiro Hitsugaya lets his emotions and sense of honor get the better of him when he goes after the thief who has stolen the treasured Ouin.
Naturally Ichigo wants to prove Toshiro's innocence; but not only must he contend with a majority of the Soul Society who want to capture and excute Toshiro for treason; Ichigo must also contend with Toshiro who won't confide why he took off after the real traitor.
Great fun, with new insights into how Soul Reapers gain their powers.
Highly Reccomended!

I don't remember it being very funny, like the series typically is. I think I would only watch it again if there were nothing else to do.",1289088000,,467,3.9263157894736844
3894769,4,B002BIULO4,"The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was extremly funny. But the second time, it seemed a little slower then I remembered. I still really like this movie, but I would probably only watch it if there really is nothing else on.",1285545600,,238,4.311111111111111
3894770,5,B002BIULO4,"First of which, this movie does the series a greater service than did its predecessor. Combining plenty of emotionally-charged battle sequences, twists, startling new revelations, and most importantly, Captain Toshiro Hitsugaya's endearing character development, this one surpasses its predecessor in almost every imaginable way. The animation conveys the somewhat dark and very emotional mood of the film quite brilliantly. As for the film's antagonist, one cannot help but feel sympathy for him when his full story comes into view. Unlike the TV anime's villains, Sojiro Kusaka is much more...human and there is a certain vulnerability about him. The way Toshiro Hitsugaya ends up casting aside the burden he chose to bear by himself for so long and open up a little more is also remarkable.
  Although this is only the second Bleach anime film to be released to the United States, this one did a far better job than the Bleach movie that came before it. Not only are the combat scenes better, but the emotion that gives life to the story of this film is so much stronger and easier to understand. Truly a well-made anime movie. The creators of Bleach couldn't have done any better with this one.

3894781,4,B002BIULO4,"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Hitsugaya is one of my favorite characters, so it was nice learning more about his background and his zanpaktou. However, I found the animation completely lacking. Did anyone else noticed that the character's eyes are way too close together? And the majority of the time the rest of the animation is still when one character is talking. It seems like the company spent the least amount of money possible and maybe even had up in coming animators work on the movie as well. Despite these facts, I still enjoyed the story and appreciated a further look into the Bleach universe.

Overall, if you love Bleach you will love this movie.",1267401600,,677,4.737288135593221
3894782,5,B002BIULO4,"This is the story of Captian Toshiro Hitsugaya of squad 10. Hitsugaya leaves his post as captain to find his old friend Kusaka, who was supposed to be dead. We learn of Hitsugaya's past as a student in the academy and we witnees the pain and sufferings Hitsugaya has been dealing with since then. This movie is so touching I cried the first time I saw it. Ichigo makes Hitsugaya realize that it brings more pain to others around him, if he does not share his burden. I recommend this movie and now I'm waiting for the third movie to complete my collection so far.",1265846400,,563,4.371428571428571
3894783,5,B002BIULO4,"Bleach is probably on eof the best ongoing anime and although the movies are in no way as good as the series this one is probably my favorite. i find it better then memories of nobody and on par with Bur'chi Fade to Black Kimi no Na o Yobu the third movie. hitsugaya is probably my favorite capt wich also made me love this movie. and i likedthe idea of ""another Hy'rinmaru"" since it might be my favorite zanpakutoh in the show and he has an extremely powerful bankai. I like the special features about the voice actors especially Masakazu Morita (the voice of ichigo) and i didn't mind that those weren't dubbed since i hate dubs anyway they take away from the experience and their voices are horrible. I hope they make another movie one much like this one!!!!!",1264204800,,762,4.45

3894788,5,B002BIULO4,"This film is without a doubt one of the greatest anime films I've seen. What he first film did wrong, this film does right. What was done right in the first film, it was done right again in this one, but even better. I really liked the action in this film A LOT. Seriously, this film has just some great action in it. The scene where Kusaka(the villain) transforms into a dragon, and then Kenpachi just charges at him was FREAKIN AWESOME. You even get an epic battle that involves the whole 13 Court Guard Squad, and yes even Head Captain Yamamotto fights. The drama with Hitsugaya wanting to take on the his burden alone was done greatly. Kusaka, the villain, was great, and you could really pity the character. Kusaka also comes off as cold when he kills his subordinates, the arrancar chicks. The score in this film was great, it even seemed dark in a couple of scenes. The story serves more like a mystery, which was nice. The main thing I liked was that you got more interaction with the other characters, unlike the first film. Chad and Ishida actually fight in this film(albeit briefly). My favorite scene(s) would have to be when Kenpachi charges at Kusaka, and when Soi-fon and Yoruichi fight. Also, you get to see Ichigo don his Hollow mask, but that only lasts for one moment. Hitsugaya in my opinion is one the most overrated characters in the Bleach universe, but he was just awesome in this film.

The only thing I didn't like was the whole ""I'm gonna take vengeance on Soul Society"" storyline, which I feel has been over-used.

3894789,1,B002BIULO4,"Don't get me wrong, Bleach was alright on the TV series from season one to... season one. This movie was really bad.  5 stars people? Are you kidding me? I mean, the we're-all-in-this-together mushy-wushy friendship theme was already corny, the story was even worse.  The makers of the film were probably drunk and decided ""Ah I know what to do director-san! Let's have them do all Bankais!"", ""Very well! that's the theme! Random all-out Bankai showcase film!""

If I was some dorky Bleach super-fan and not a film critic, I would go ""OMGOMGOMGOMG!!! bankaaais! This is soooo coooool, and Toshiro is soooo cute!"", but man, I'm not.

Just like I said:
1.) I like Bleach
2.) But I'm a critic, not a faithful fan
3.) If only this movie was made better, I would give it a high rank
4.) but this movie was poorly made.
5.) I even find Bleach - Memories of Nobody better than this.

The plot of the story was so simple, I already expected what would happen 10 minutes from the start of the film.

The lines were horrible.

They tried to fit all of the characters in one movie, that they all ran out of lines and had almost less than 10 words each, and you can't barely focus on the character. If there were characters with more lines, they just keep saying almost the thing.

And the fight scene was also bad. It's so, ""Bleach"".  All the characters are fighting all at the same time you lose focus and have no centered attention on the action. And just as I said, this was made for over-frantic bleach nerds talking about Bankais all day, and those who have crushes on drawn people like the Hitsugaya boy.",1254528000,3,1598,4.445205479452055
3894790,4,B002BIULO4,"loved it, despite canon flaws such as Ichigo flying in some sequences. but on the whole,the character development for Hitsugaya-taicho is well done, the plot is suitable and well planned. while Ichigo takes second seat in this film which is a refresher, but still puts in valuable input. Hitsugaya's past is slowly peeled back throughout the film, glimpses of academy days, and forging friendship with Kusaka, the main villain in the film.
along here are my most memorable thoughts of the film
 while I may not agree with central 46's dealings with kusaka and Hitsugaya, I certainly understand their logic, 2 people with same potential and power, Hitsugaya doesn't want to harm his friend for the power, Kusaka just proves that his hunger for power makes him much more dangerous. also Ken-pachi makes a great appearance in the film, almost getting himself killed in the process, but then this is Ken-pachi we're talking about, and the line that make Hitsugaya, well hitsugaya-taicho, during one of the last scenes of the film 'it's Hitsugaya-taicho to you.' I was relieved and laughing at that (throughout the film Ichigo constantly calls him 'Toushiro', something that Hitsugaya usually hates). the texture and plot of the film is well planned, and character development has been spectacular. can't wait for 'Fade to black'/ 'I call your name' to come out now",1254355200,,1360,5.044444444444444

When I first took it out of the package, I was worried about some of the scratches on the disk, but it played perfectly from start to finish. I bought it from a secondhand seller off this listing for only $3, and I'm very happy with the purchase. :) Although it was listed as having English and Japanese audio, mine was a Japanese edition and only had English subtitles. I can't complain though, it was incredibly cheap and plays better than most used disks from Amazon do. All in all, I'm thrilled to finally have a physical copy of this movie. Can't wait to get my other 2 purchases from Better World Books. :)",1472342400,,681,4.412698412698413
