2596289,5,B000G0O5FA,"The undisputed queen of late-night B-movie horror flicks, ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark""--a character invented and portrayed by Cassandra Peterson--debuted on Los Angeles television station KHJ in 1981, dredging up the very worst in horror, science fiction, and monster movies as the host of Elvira's Movie Macabre. Beyond her outrageously low-cut gown and towering black bouffant, Elvira was also known for her bawdy double-entendres and her sarcastic, Valley Girl-ish humor--at commercial breaks she poked fun at the films' clumsily dubbed voices, murky plots, and unconvincing special effects. This DVD double feature reproduces two complete episodes of the show, with Elvira's original introductions, comments, and skits. The films themselves are remastered from new film transfers, and can also be watched without Elvira's wraparound segments. Five travelers are forced to take refuge in the infamous Castle Dracula, in Count Dracula's Great Love (1972). Unfortunately for them, the master (Paul Naschy) is in. But when one of the travelers actually falls in love with the count, she must choose between her mortal soul and an eternity as his bride. In the 1974 film Frankenstein's Castle Of Freaks (1974), the obsessive scientist (Rossano Brazzi) brings a Neanderthal man back to life, but must keep it a secret from the authorities, the townspeople, and his own daughter, who's preparing for her wedding. Horror icon and Tony Award nominee Michael Dunn is featured.",1251158400,6,1472,5.488986784140969

OK ... two movies here.  Count Dracula has 5 uninvited guests show up (1 male, and 4 females ... can you guess what kind of sex will ensue?) after their carriage breaks down and their driver is killed.  Count D. falls for the OBVIOUS SLUT, but since his ""true love"" is supposed to be a virgin, she is out.  In fact, that requirement means only one of our females is eligible, so he chooses her and commits hari-kari when she rejects him.  By now we have done the same.

Count Frankenstein (Count? Count? Our lovely hostess with the mostess points out that DRACULA is the Count, FRANKENSTEIN is a BARON.  Fine....)  gets a visit from his daughter, her fiance, and her best friend who is getting her PhD. in Chemistry and Biology, but more interested in getting her Mrs. in Germanic nobility!!  Meanwhile the Count's servants are all up to their own machinations which lead to the ruin of his latest experiment and death.

You can watch either film without Elvira ... but WHY???  Why would anyone want to watch these in the first place (the sex is hardly worth it, the violence is mild by 1950s standards, the stories are only slightly less ethereal than the budget)??  The lovely Elvira is what makes these flops worth the price of admission.",1207353600,6,1272,4.5550660792951545
2596293,4,B000G0O5FA,"...And they're Elvira as the horror host and the movies themselves (what'd you think I meant?) Seriously, though I'll leave the corny jokes to Elvira, and she lets those babies fly... (again, the jokes!)

  Elvira is extremely hot and I used to sneak watching her on Movie Macabre back in Richmond, VA in the late 80's and early 90's. Loved it and this is great nostalgia. Highly recommended!",1188259200,11,392,4.735294117647059
2596294,3,B000G0O5FA,"I used to stay up late to catch Movie Macabre with Elvira on weekends during the 80's.  I was thrilled to hear finally after 20+ years they were going to release some of the shows on DVD.

The one reason to buy was to see Elvira host the movies and add her comedic take on the film.  Her over the top character and dialog filled with innuendo was what made her fun to watch.

Unfortunately one of her sketches is edited in ""Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks"".  It removes John Paragon as her ""bad joke"" telling stalker/fan ""Breather"".  There doesn't seem to be a real reason for this since Paragon is shown in the closing credits of the show ""John Paragon as the Breather"".

Also not included are several (quick) interruptions Elvira had made during scenes of the film.  Something would happen during the film and she would make a short joking comment and then go right back to the movie before her pre-commercial advertisments (longer) sketches.

Hopefully the next batch of episodes will have Elvira's unedited scenes intact.  The DVDs do include the movie without Elvira.  Though fans are more interested in Elvira and Movie Macabre.  I'm happy they released some of the shows but Shout! Factory could have at least given a disclaimer that the Elvira scenes were edited to begin with.

I guess it's better than nothing, but at least let fans know what they're getting.",1158883200,35,1369,4.701680672268908
2596295,4,B000G0O5FA,"This 2 dvd set brings back great memories of the old MOVIE MACABRE show from the 1980's. Lot's of schlocky horror movie fun hosted by one of the all-time hot funny babes, Elvira! The picture quality in both films are bad. I guess that's to be expected. It kinda adds to the ""B"" feeling of the whole production. All in all it's good fun, but parents do beware. The packaging and Amazon rating says the 2 features are rated ""PG"" but there is lot's of nudity scattered throughout both films. These obviously aren't the edited for TV cuts I've seen previously. I'll have to check out the other 2 new Elvira sets now. Recommended!",1158796800,18,625,4.491228070175438
